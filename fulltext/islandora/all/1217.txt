Abstract 
    A CONSIGNMENT STOCK POLICY FOR A TWOLEVEL SUPPLY CHAIN WITH IMPERFECT QUALITY ITEMS    Ehab A. Bazan  Master of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering  Ryerson University, 2011    A  consignment  stock  is  a  type  of  supplychain  coordination  for  the  management  of  supplychains  in  which  there  is  a  joint  vendor  and  buyer  policy  that  is  mainly  focused  on  having  the  vendor  manage  the  buyer's  inventory.  This  thesis  aims  to  investigate  the  consignment  stock  strategy  in  a  singlevendor  singlebuyer  supplychain  context  considering  imperfect  items  that  may  be  produced  from  an  imperfect  production  process.  It  develops  a  flexible  mathematical  model  that  allows  for  managerial  decisions  with  regards  to  imperfect  items  and  seeks  to  minimize  costs  (maximize  profits)  of  the  supplychain.  Such  managerial  decisions  include  scrapping  items  at  a  cost,  selling  them  for  a  marginal  profit  to  a  secondary  market, applying rework, and/or applying minor setups to restore the production process. Results show  that  the  introduction  of  imperfect  items  increases  the  batch  size  and  reduces  the  number  of  shipments.  Minor setups were shown to reduce cost, increase the number of shipments and reduce its size.

1.1. Overview of Supply Chain    1.1.1. The Importance of the Supply Chain    Supply  Chains  have  become  a  vital  element  of  any  current  business  whether  manufacturing  products  or  providing  a  service.  Its  introduction  is  a  direct  result  of  differences  and  discrepancies  between  supply  and demand throughout the different stages of the business. Assume the following scenario of a vendor  who  supplies  products  to  a  buyer:  if  the  demand  is  more  than  what  the  supplier  has  to  offer,  shortages  will occur and may lead to backlogs or lost sales. On the contrary, if the supply available is  greater than  the buyer's demand, excess inventory will be on hand leading to additional costs.    The vendor and buyer could be considered any two participants in a supply chain whereby one precedes  the  other,  for  example:  two  production  stages  within  a  facility,  or  a  supplier  and  manufacturer,  etc.  Figure 1.1 depicts a simple supply chain structure.  1   

   

 
Figure 1.1  Schematic representing a simplified supply chain network 

  Furthermore, there could be more than two parties involved in a supply chain: many suppliers providing  many  materials  to  a  manufacturer  which  produces  products  to  be  shipped  to  warehouses  and  later  to  distributors,  before  the  products  finally  reach  the  customer.  Figure  1.2  depicts  a  complex  supply  chain  structure.  The  more  parties  there  are  in  a  supply  chain,  the  more  complex  and  costly  it  becomes.  In  brief, for a supply chain to be successful, it has to be efficient and responsive.   

 
Figure 1.2  Schematic representing a more complex supply chain network 

  In addition, storage and material handling costs in such supply chain networks can be as high as 50% of a  product's indirect operating expenses (Rosenblatt, 1986). So reducing inventory related costs in a supply  chain  remains  a  pressing  issue  which  this  thesis  will  address.  The  next  section  will  provide  readers  with  some of the definitions of a supply chain and its functional areas that are available in the literature.        2   

1.1.2. Supply Chain Definitions and Key Concepts    There are various definitions of a supply chain, some of which are:    "A supply chain is the alignment of firms that bring products or services to market."  (Lambert et al., 2003)  "A supply chain consists of all stages involved, directly or indirectly, in fulfilling a customer  request. The supply chain not only includes the manufacturer and suppliers, but also  transporters, warehouses, retailers, and customers themselves . . ."  (Chopra et al., 2003)   "A supply chain is a network of facilities and distribution options that performs the functions of  procurement of materials, transformation of these materials into intermediate and finished  products, and the distribution of these finished products to customers."  (Ganeshan et al., 1995)    Although  different,  all  the  definitions  share  the  common  essence  in  that  there  is  a  network  (as  depicted  in figure 1.2), there are participants playing roles in this network, and that the overall objective of all the  parties  is  to  bring  the  service  or  product  to  the  end  user  customer.  The  entities  or  participants  in  such  networks  have  conflicting  objectives,  where  each  entity  would  like  to  maximize  (minimize)  its  profit  (cost).  Supply  chain  management  provides  the  tools  to  effectively  and  efficiently  manage  such  complex  supply chain networks.    Supply chain management can be defined as:   "The systematic, strategic coordination of the traditional business functions and the tactics  across these business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the  supply chain, for the purpose of improving the longterm performance of the individual  companies and the supply chain as a whole."  (Mentzer et al., 2001)    From  this  definition,  an  entity  within  a  supply  chain  must  make  individual  and  group  decisions  concerning  five  functional  areas:  production,  inventory,  facility  location,  transportation,  and  information.  For  example,  if  a  business' strategy  is  to target  a  mass  market  and  compete  on  the  basis  of  price,  the  combined  result  of  the  decisions  to  be  made  must  optimize  the  supply  chain  for  the  lowest  3   

cost.  However,  if  a  business'  strategy  is  to  target  a  specific  market  segment  and  compete  on  customer  service,  the  supply  chain  managerial  decisions  must  optimize  for  responsiveness.  Generally,  it  can  be  said  that  supply  chain  management  is  the  coordination  of  the  aforementioned  five  functional  areas  to  achieve the optimal scenario for the target market.    Examples  of  the  decisions  to  be  made  could  be  answers  to  the  following  questions  concerning  the  five  functional areas:   Production   Products to be produced (as determined by the target market)  Amount of each product produced and delivery times (market demands) 

Inventory  The amount of inventory to be stored at each stage  The amount to be held as rawmaterials, semifinished, or finished goods  Optimal inventory level and reorder points 

 

Facility location  Location of production and inventory storage facilities 

Transportation  Inventory movement from one facility location to another  Means of transportation 



Information  Data that should be collected  Information to be shared  Timeliness and accuracy of information 

  1.1.3. Supply Chain Performance Metrics    As  previously  mentioned,  the  overall  objective  a  supply  chain  is  dependent  on  the  market  to  which  the  business  is  targeting,  and  accordingly,  this  shifts  the  optimization  process  towards  different  optimal  parameters.  Compulsory  to  determining  these  optimal  parameters  is  the  ability  to  measure  the  performance  of  a  given  supply  chain.  Basically,  each  market  type  requires  a  different  mix  of  performance  measures.  Four  performance  measurement  categories  cover  this  scope.  They  are:  customer  service,  internal  efficiency,  demand  flexibility,  and  product  development.  The  metrics  that  4   

measure  the  performance  in  these  four  categories  can  be  applied  to  the  individual  business  or  collectively to the entire supply chain.    Customer Service Metrics   "Service relates to the ability to anticipate, capture and fulfill customer demand with  personalized products and ontime delivery"  (Hausman, 2000)    There  are  two  main  scenarios  of  concern:  buildtoorder  and  buildtostock.  A  buildtoorder  scenario  is  a  situation  where  a  customized  product  is  ordered  by  a  customer.  Hence,  the  product  is  `built'  for  a  specific  `order'.  A  buildtostock  scenario  is  one  where  a  general  product  is  supplied  to  a  large  market.  Hence  the  product  is  `built'  and  `stocked'  in  inventory  for  a  certain  period  before  satisfying  market  demands to utilize means of mass production and economies of scale.    Popular metrics for a buildtoorder scenario include:         Popular metrics for a buildtostock scenario include:         Internal Efficiency Metrics  When  a  business  or  a  supply  chain  utilizes  their  assets  as  profitable  as  possible,  this  is  referred  to  as  internal efficiency. Some measures for internal efficiency include:   Inventory value  5    Complete order fill rate and order line item fill rate  Ontime delivery rate  Value of total backorders and number of backorders  Frequency and distribution of backorders  Line item return rate  Quoted customer response time and ontime completion rate  Ontime delivery rate  Value of late orders and number of late orders  Frequency and duration of late orders  Number of warranty returns and repairs 

    

Inventory turns  Return on sales  Cashtocash cycle times 

Demand Flexibility Metrics  Demand  flexibility  refers  to  a  business  or  supply  chain's  ability  to  respond  to  change  in  new  demands  such as additional order volume or with the provision of additional `new' products that are currently not  part of the regular products usually provided. Some metrics for demand flexibility include:       Product Development Metrics  Markets  constantly  evolve  with  time.  If  a  business  or  supply  chain  does  not  evolve  accordingly  with  the  market  it  targets,  it  will  be  replaced.  Product  development  measures  the  business  or  supply  chain's  ability  to  design,  build,  and  deliver  new  products  to  serve  their  target  markets.  Some  performance  metrics include:       SCOR Model  There  are  several  layers  or  levels  of  performance  metrics  available  to  measure  the  performance  of  a  given  supply  chain.  The  SupplyChain  Council's  SCOR  models  suggests  each  business  or  supply  chain  is  required to build a system that can present data at three levels of details:           6    Strategic: to assist management in deciding `what to do' (SCOR Level 1 data)  Tactical:  to  assist  middle  management  in  deciding  `how  to  do  it'  (SCOR  Level  2  data  or  Level  2  Performance Metrics)  Operational: to assist people `actually to do it' (SCOR Level 3 data, or Level 3 Diagnostic Metrics)  Percentage of total products sold that were introduced in the last year  Percentage of total sales from products introduced in the last year  Cycle time to develop and deliver a new product  Activity cycle time  Upside flexibility (when considering flexibility in demand volume)  Outside flexibility (when considering additional `new' products) 

1.2. Supply Chain Coordination    1.2.1. The `BullWhip' Effect    Businesses  at  different  stages  in  the  supply  chain  have  different  forecasts  and  estimates  of  market  demands.  The  `bullwhip'  effect  is  the  effect  that  happens  when  large  variations  in  demands  experienced  by  businesses  further  back  in  the  supplychain  happen  as  a  result  of  small  changes  in  demand by the consumer at the forefront of the supply chain as depicted in figure 1.3.    Research into the bullwhip effect leads us to five major factors that cause this effect:         The  aforementioned  five  factors  may  act  together  in  different  combinations  in  different  supply  chains.  However,  the  overall  effect  is  that  together  they  produce  undisciplined  demand  swings  that  make  it  difficult to manage an efficient supply chain.        Demand forecasting  Order batching  Product rationing  Product pricing  Performance incentives

1.2.2. Supply Chain Data Synchronization    As products move through a supply chain, they are transferred from participants in the supply chain that  are  not  necessarily  under  the  same  business.  They  may  be  different  companies  or  service  providers.  Regardless,  the  products  need  to  be  identified  and  traced  so  that  the  amounts  of  products  moving  through  the  supply  chain  are  known.  Moreover,  the  products  need  to  be  classified  so  that  it  is  known  which type of product is being handled.    There  are  many  standards  and  coding  techniques  present.  However,  if  the  codes  are  standardized  and  synchronized  within  the  supply  chain,  time  spent  in  translating  the  product  codes  from  one  party  to  another  may  be  eliminated  and  possible  errors  in  translation  in  invoicing  and  making  payments  can  be  eliminated.  Furthermore,  other  consequences  from  the  lack  of  accuracy  and  clarity  in  sales  history  can  be  avoided.  Even  with  the  use  of  a  universal  code  for  the  product  between  the  parties  in  the  supply  chain,  it  should  be  noted  that  business  may  keep  their  existing  internal  part  numbers  and  codes  for  internal operations.    1.2.3. Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment    Collaborative  planning,  forecasting  and  replenishment  issues  are  vital  to  supply  chains.  Supply  chains  that  use  technology  to  support  these  issues  are  the  more  efficient  supply  chains  as  they  can  best  manage factors that give rise to the bullwhip effect.    Collaborative  planning  includes  negotiations  of  frontend  agreements  that  define  the  responsibilities  and  roles  of  the  businesses  collaborating  with  each  other  within  the  supply  chain.  It  also  includes  the  infrastructure  of  a  joint  businessplan  that  illustrates  how  the  businesses  will  work  together  to  meet  market demands.    Collaborative forecasting comprises of creating a sales forecast for all the collaborating businesses in the  supply  chain.  This  includes  identifying  and  resolving  any  exceptions  or  differences  between  businesses  to provide a common forecast.   

9   

Collaborative  replenishment  uses  the  collaborative  forecasts  and  allows  for  resolving  exceptions  to  provide  efficient  production  and  delivery  schedules.  It  is  where  actual  orders  are  generated  to  meet  customer demands.    It  should  be  noted  that  in  general,  the  more  a  product  is  simpler  in  design,  the  less  complex  a  supply  chain  will  be  required,  which  in  turn  will  reduce  production  costs  and  allow  for  increase  in  responsiveness to market demands.    1.2.4. Centralized and Decentralized Policies    Coordination  decisions  in  supply  chains  are  either  centralized  or  decentralized.  Decentralized  policies  involve  numerous  decisions  within  the  different  participants  in  a  supplychain.  It  is  not  uncommon  that  the  different  decisions  have  conflicting  objectives  resulting  from  each  participant's  perspective.  This  leads  to  centralized  policies,  where  a  single  decision  maker  (or  a  team  of  decision  makers)  manages  the  entire  supply  chain  to  achieve  the  overall  objective,  whether  it  be  minimizing  the  supply  chain  costs  or  maximizing its profits.    There  are  many  research  literatures  discussing  centralized  coordination  in  supply  chains.  These  include  quantitative  models concerning  twolevel, threelevel, and fourormorelevel  supply chains. The  bulk of  the  research  literature  involves  twolevel  supply  chains.  In  these  research  studies,  the  economic  order  quantity  model  (EOQ  model)  is  considered  the  base  foundation  for  most  models.  It  is  where  coordination  is  applied  between  a  vendor  and  a  buyer  to  optimize  their  combined  costs  (Jaber  and  Zolfaghari, 2008).      1.2.5. The Consignment Stock Policy    The concept of inventory consignment is an arrangement where a `buyer' business would physically hold  items  in  its  inventory  without  `owning'  the  items.  (SimchiLevi  2000,  Coughlan  2001).  Upon  use  of  the  items in production or rather consumed, the buyer business will make the appropriate payments for the  purchase  of  the  consumed  items.  That  is  to  say,  within  the  consignment  stock  inventory  model  the 

10   

`change  of  ownership'  of  the  items  is  unrelated  to  the  shipment  of  the  items  from  one  party  (the  vendor) to the other (the buyer). This is contrary to the basic design of most inventory systems.    The consignment stock strategy was observed as an industrial practice in the automotive  manufacturing  environment  (Braglia  and  Zavanella  2003).  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003)  provided  analytical  modeling  that  refers  to  a  singlevendor  singlebuyer  scenario  to  help  in  understanding  the  behavior  and  aptitude  of  the  consignment  stock  policy  in  the  supply  chain  coordination  context.  Briefly,  consignment  stock  is  considered  an  innovative  approach  to  supply  and  stock  management  designed  to  achieve  gains  to  all  parties  in  the  supply  chain.  This  can  only  be  achieved  when  the  foundation  is  laid  for  a  robust  and  accurate  collaboration  between  the  parties  concerned.  As  discussed  in  section  1.2.3  this  will  provide  a  more efficient supply chain as it best manages the factors that give rise to the bullwhip effect.    1.2.6. The Issue of Imperfect Production    With  regards  to  research  concerning  supply  chain  and  coordination  in  supply  chains,  two  main  assumptions  are  evident  in  initial  studies:  the  equipment  and  machinery  used  in  a  production  process  are  not  subject  to  failures  and  the  output  produced  from  the  process  has  no  defectives  (Wang,  Lin,  Chen,  2009).  In  the  real  world,  this  assumption  is  less  valid,  and  research  has  introduced  the  concept  of  imperfect  items  in  their  context.  Porteus  (1985,  1986)  and  Rosenblatt  and  Lee  (1986)  assume  that  a  process is incontrol and then will shift with a specified probability to an outofcontrol state and remain  as  such  until  the  next  setup  in  the  process.  Their  work  has  provided  a  foundation  for  later  research  considering  minor  interruptions  and  minor  setups  to  restore  process  quality  (Khouja,  2005  and  El  Saadany,  Jaber,  2005).  The  concept  of  imperfect  production  in  the  consignment  stock  context  has  not  been thoroughly investigated.      1.3. Objective of the Thesis    Being  industry  induced,  the  supply  chain  coordination  known  as  the  consignment  stock  requires  further  investigation  to  develop  a  complete  understanding  of  the  policy,  its  strategy  and  how  it  behaves  under  various circumstances.    11   

Specifically, the overall objective of this study is to develop and apply a mathematical model to simulate  the  behavior  of  a  consignment  stock  model  susceptible  to  imperfect  production.  In  addition,  the  model  shall accommodate various managerial decisions that may emerge and transpire as a result of the reality  of imperfect production.    1.4. Organization of the Thesis    Chapter 1  Chapter  1  introduces  the  topic  of  supply  chain,  coordination  mechanisms  focusing  on  the  consignment  stock policy and imperfect production relating to supply coordination mechanisms.    Chapter 2  Chapter  2  provides  a  literature  review  surveying  research  in  three  directions  discussing  Hill's  model,  a  classical  approach  to  supply  chain  coordination,  the  consignment  stock  model,  and  related  research  covering  the  issue  of  imperfect  production  as  related  to  the  two  supply  chain  coordination  policies.  The  chapter  will  also  provide  a  clear  definition  of  the  problem  and  conclude  with  a  comprehensive  list  of  objectives for the study.    Chapter 3  Chapter 3 is divided into two three main sections. The first section discusses the mathematical modeling  of  the  consignment  stock  model  as  presented  by  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003).  This  model  shall  be  considered  the  basemodel  for  this  study.  The  second  section  extends  the  current  basemodel  model  to  allow  for  other  cost  parameters  to  be  incorporated  in  the  model  to  accommodate  imperfect  production  scenarios.  The  third  section  proposes  a  new  model  that  accommodates  the  scenarios  of  the  extended model and permits minor setups for restoration of the process.    Chapter 4  Chapter  4  discusses  the  application  of  the  various  scenarios  in  the  extended  and  proposed  models  comparing  them  to  develop  insights  and  a  more  complete  understanding  of  the  consignment  stock  policy relating it closer to the real world.      12   

Chapter 5  Chapter 5 looks into the results of the various experiments of the models and their respective scenarios,  present conclusions, and suggests further points of research that can be extended to the current study.

Literature Review 

This  chapter  will  provide  a  review  of  available  literature  concerning  three  lines  of  research,  namely:  supply  chain  coordination,  the  issue  of  imperfect  quality  items  in  supply  chains  and  consignment  stock  coordination.  Subsequently,  the  chapter  will  provide  a  problem  definition  to  confine  the  research  objectives of this thesis to challenge certain research gaps within the review that was conducted. Hence,  this  chapter  will  provide  a  conceptual  skeleton  to  this  thesis  and  a  comprehensive  list  of  specific  research objectives.    2.1.1  Supply Chain Coordination    Chapter one of this thesis discussed supply chain and supply chain coordination visiting areas such as the  importance  of  supply  chains,  supply  chain  definitions  and  key  concepts,  performance  metrics,  the  bull whip effect, and centralized and decentralized policies. In general, it can be said that the effectiveness of  supply  chains  can  be  evaluated  by  optimizing  the  supply  chain  through  minimizing  costs  or  maximizing  profits,  or  through  providing  superior  services  (e.g.,  demand  flexibility,  reduced  lead  times...).  Supply  chain coordination seeks to harmonize efforts between the members of the supply chain to enhance the  chain's performance.    The literature discussing supply chain coordination, in general, considers two main decision variables for  coordination:  the  amount  of  materials  transported  from  one  member  to  another  in  the  chain,  and  the  14   

number  of  transport  shipments  required.  It  can  be  said  that  the  regulation  and  finetuning  of  both  decision variables is a means of coordinating a supply chain.    This  section  will  discuss  supply  chain  coordination  focusing  on  quantitative  models  showing  how  members  in  a  supply  chain  seek  to  optimize  their  performance  through  adopting  various  centralized  decision making processes, incentive schemes, and other policies.    Jaber  and  Zolfaghari  (2008)  review  the  literature  for  quantitative  models  for  centralized  supply  chain  coordination  that  put  emphasis  on  inventory  management  from  the  year  1990  to  the  end  of  2007.  They  classify the models presented in the literature on the basis of incentive schemes, supply chain levels and  assumptions  taken  into  consideration.  They  review  the  literature  under  the  following  subject  headers:  centralized  coordination,  twolevel  supply  chain  models,  three  level  supply  chain  models  and  fourlevel  or more supply chain models.    The framework of this thesis research focuses on a twolevel supply chain model and hence, this section  shall only refer to literature reviewed by Jaber and Zolfaghari (2008) present related  to twolevel supply  chain models.    Jaber and Zolfaghari (2008) cited the work of Goyal and Gupta (1989) that suggests the coordination in a  supply  chain  be  realized  through  the  integration  of  lotsizing  models.  Goyal  and  Gupta  (1989)  also  mention  that  such  coordination  cannot  be  possible  unless  orders  between  members  in  the  supply  chain  provide  trade  credit  options,  with  the  most  common  being  quantity  discount  and  delay  in  payment  mechanisms.    Jaber  and  Zolfaghari  (2008)  move  on  to  address  the  work  of  Thomas  and  Griffin  (1996)  that  reviews  previous  literature  concerned  with  coordinated  planning  between  two  or  more  stages  of  the  supply  chain.  This  review  has  made  clear  the  three  categories  of  operational  coordination:  vendorbuyer  coordination,  productiondistribution  coordination  and  inventorydistribution  coordination. 

Furthermore,  the  review  was  concerned  with  models  that  concentrated  on  batch  size,  the  type  of  transportation  and  the  production  quantity.  Subsequently,  Jaber  and  Zolfaghari  (2008)  discuss  the  work  of  Maloni  and  Benton  (1997),  Sarmah  et  al.  (2006)  and  Li  and  Wang  (2007),  and  how  these  studies  lacked  the  surveying  of  mathematical  models.  What  the  work  of  Jaber  and  Zolfaghari  aims  at  15   

accomplishing  is  the  presentation  of  mathematical  models  in  its  review  that  facilitates  observable  findings of similarities and differences between the various models.    As  mentioned  by  Jaber  and  Zolfaghari  (2008),  the  economic  order  quantity  (EOQ)  model  is  the  foundation  for  almost  all  available  models  presented  in  the  literature.  The  EOQ  model  is  a  twolevel  chain  whereby  coordination  occurs  between  a  vendor  (manufacturer  or  supplier)  and  a  buyer  to  optimize their joint costs. Jaber and Zolfaghari (2008) continue through their review to discuss the works  considering  vendorbuyer  coordination  including  the  works  of  Dolan  (1987),  Goyal  (1997),  Hill  (1997),  Munson and Rosenblatt (1998), Woo et al. (2000), Yang and Wee (2003), and Zhou and Wang (2007).    Jaber and Zolfaghari (2008), continue their review by surveying studies that have built on the foundation  of  the  basic  vendorbuyer  coordination  problem.  They  categorize  the  research  based  on  the  assumptions relaxed in the studies, which include:             The  following  table  (Table  2.1)  summarizes  the  research  studies  reviewed  by  Jaber  and  Zolfaghari  categorized under each relaxed assumption.

Table 2.1  Summary of research presented and reviewed by Jaber and Zolfaghari (2008) 

Beyond  the  literature  reviewed  by  Jaber  and  Zolfaghari  (2008)  much  research  has  been  extended  along  different  lines  of  study  regarding  supply  chain  coordination.  Li  and  Wang  (2007)  provide  a  framework  highlighting  the  behavioral  aspects  and  information  needed  in  the  coordination  of  a  supply  chain.  Their  work  offers  a  review  of  coordination  mechanisms  in  supply  chain  systems.  Li  and  Wang  (2007)  classify  supply chain coordination mechanisms into four categories based on the supply chain decision structure,  whether  it  be  centralized  or  decentralized,  and  on  the  nature  of  the  demand,  whether  it  be  deterministic  or  stochastic.  They  further  discuss  existing  models  in  the  four  categories  and  point  out  several directions for future work.    Xue  et  al.  (2007)  focus  on  the  construction  industry  and  how  it  differs  from  other  manufacturing  industries  with  regards  to  their  high  fragmentation,  low  productivity,  costs,  delays,  conflicts  and  disputes. These characteristics give construction supply chains a unique coordination problem. Xue et al.  (2007) present two internetenabled coordination mechanisms for improving construction performance.  Their  work  highlights  the  fact  the  supply  chain  coordination  is  vital  to  all  industries  regardless  of  their  nature.    Xiao,  Qi  and  Yu  (2007)  investigate  coordination  mechanisms  in  a  nonconventional  supply  chain  coordination  model.  Their  model  consists  of  one  manufacturer  and  two  competing  retailers.  They  assume  market  demands  could  be  disrupted,  which  makes  their  model  differ  from  the  conventional  supply  chain  models.  Examples  for  market  demand  disruptions  are  provided  that  include  breakout  of  medical  diseases,  or  the  reputation  of  a  defective  part,  or  an  event  that  may  make  a  book/product  a  best  seller.  Xiao,  Qi  and  Yu  (2007)  consider  the  cases  where  the  production  deviation  cost  may  be 

21   

incurred  by  the  manufacturer  or  the  retailers,  and  cases  where  there  is  no  discount,  linear  quantity discount and an allunit quantity discount schedule.    Xiao  and  Qi  (2008),  extend  along  the  line  of  research  by  Xiao,  Qi  and  Yu  (2007).  They  investigate  the  coordination  of  supply  chains  with  both  demand  disruptions  in  addition  to  production  cost  disruptions.  They  refer  the  term  production  cost  disruptions  to  situations  where  production  costs  change  from  their  expected  values  that  have  been  used  to  design  the  coordination  mechanism  to  be  implemented.  Such  cost disruptions may result from increase in  government  tariffs, for example, or from peaks in costs due  to  shortages  of  raw  materials  resulting  from  an  environmental  catastrophe,  or  other  unanticipated  reasons. Xiao and Qi (2008) consider the coordination mechanisms for both an allquantity discount and  incremental quantity discount policies.    Li  and  Liu  (2008)  take  an  alternative  approach  to  modeling  a  discount  policy  to  allocate  the  expected  increased  profits  between  two  sides  of  the  supply  chain.  They  consider  a  supply  chain  with  one  manufacturer  and  one  retailer.  Li  and  Liu  (2008)  develop  an  extended  newsboy  model  and  presents  a  coordination mechanism designed to increase the supply chain's total profit.    In  general,  quantity  discounts  allow  a  practical  method  for  inventory  coordination  in  supply  chains.  Shin  and Benton (2007) put forward difficulties facing supply chain participants in implementing coordination  policies.  Their  main  objective  is  to  develop  a  model  that  resolves  these  practical  challenges.  Shin  and  Benton  (2007)  show  that  such  implementation  difficulties  are  due  to  possible  lot  sizes  adjustments  deviating  from  the  original  economic  lot  sizes  and  possible  overstocking  risks  related  to  increased  order  quantities.  They  propose  a  Buyer's  Risk  Adjustment  (BRA)  model  which  is  considered  a  feasible  alternative for supply chain coordination under certain demand conditions mentioned in their work.    Ro  et  al.  (2007)  look  at  modularity  as  a  strategy  for  supply  chain  coordination  and  discuss  its  implementation  in  the  United  States  automotive  industry.  They  portray  the  success  of  modularity  applied  by  Dell  Computers  and  investigate  how  modularity  may  be  emulated  in  the  United  States  automotive  industry  as  part  of  a  cost  reduction  and  masscustomization  approach  to  achieve  buildto order.  They  suggest  that  the  shift  to  modularity  has  led  to  changes  in  the  industry's  supply  chain.  Their  findings  are  a  result  of  interviews  and  no  model  is  developed,  however,  they  shed  light  to  important 

22   

aspects  of  the  United  States  automotive  industry  supply  chains  and  the  barriers  that  face  them  in  shifting the industry towards modularity.    Zhou,  Min  and  Goyal  (2008)  consider  the  coordination  issues  of  a  decentralized  twolevel  supply  chain  composed  of  a  manufacturer  and  retailer,  where  the  demand  for  the  product  is  dependent  on  the  inventory  level  on  display.  They  develop  a  profitsharing  mechanism  to  coordinate  the  behavior  of  the  two  partners  in  the  supply  chain  to  maximize  profits.  In  their  work  they  discuss  the  manufacturer Stackelberg game structure to determine how the  manufacturer sets the wholesale price  of the product  and,  in  turn,  the  retailer  determines  the  order  quantity.  Zhou,  Min  and  Goyal  (2008)  assume  that  relevant cost information is shared and hence provide a discount scheme to further maximize profits.    Hennet  and  Arda  (2008)  acknowledge  the  fact  that  in  any  supply  chain,  each  participant  targets  to  optimize  their  own  production  and  supply  policy  with  respect  to  their  own  economic  criterion  and  that  conflicts  of  interests  are  natural  to  occur.  Hennet  and  Arda  (2008)  highlight  that  the  process  of  deciding  on a policy to coordinate between participants in the supply chain may result in loss of overall efficiency  of  the  supply  chain  performance.  They  direct  their  work  to  evaluate  the  different  types  of  contracts  between  participants  in  a  supply  chain.  They  assume  a  chain  with  a  supplier  and  producer  where  the  producer is confronted with random demand and the supplier faces random leadtime. Hennet and Arda  (2008)  also  draw  attention  to  the  fact  the  dominant  player  in  the  supply  chain  leads  to  a  Stackelberg  game,  yet  global  optimal  conditions  may  be  reached  provided  the  contracts  between  the  participants  allow for shifting of local optimal values.    As  can  be  seen  from  the  literature  presented  contracts  are  merely  tools  to  achieve  coordination  between  participants  in  a  supply  chain.  Such  contracts  can  be  summarized  to  include  quantity  flexibility  contracts,  backup  agreements,  buyback  or  return  policies,  incentive  mechanisms  and  revenue  sharing  contracts. Wang, Zhao and Tang (2008) focus on revenuesharing  in a supply chain with one  retailer and  one  supplier  considering  fuzzy  demand.  Wang,  Zhao  and  Tang  (2008)  consider  two  kind  of  fuzzy  demand:  isoprice  elastic  demand  and  linear  demand.  They  conclude  by  stating  that  future  work  considering more complex fuzzy demands should be considered.    Choi  et  al.  (2008)  investigate  the  issues  of  channel  coordination  in  a  supply  chain.  They  draw  attention  to  that  most  of  the  literature  is  focused  on  either  maximizing  expected  profits  or  minimizing  expected  23   

costs  in  a  supply  chain,  however,  the  literature  does  not  mention  different  risk  preferences  of  the  individual  participants  in  the  supply  chain.  They  take  a  fashion  product  and  its  corresponding  supply  chain  as  an  example  where  different  risk  preferences  are  significantly  important  and  different.  They  formulate  meanvariance  (MV)  objectives  to  capture  the  risk  preference  for  each  individual  participant.  Choi  et  al.  (2008)  propose  strategies  and  discuss  managerial  insights  that  may  help  in  achieving  channel  coordination.    Wang et al. (2008) talk about the emergence of ebusiness to drive supply chain coordination, the use of  internet  based  computing  and  communications  to  execute  business  processes,  and  how  the  focus  of  supply  chain  management  has  been  diverted  from  "productionefficiency  to  customerdriven  and  partnership  synchronization  approaches".  Wang  et  al.  (2008)  mention  the  need  for  coordination  of  information flow among the services of the participants in the supply chain and the need to link business  processes  as  key  to  supply  chain  success.  Concisely,  Wang  et  al.  (2008)  address  the  issues  of  uncertainties  and  dynamics  involved  in  a  realworld  environment.  They  develop  a  multiagent  system  which  makes  constraintbased  decisions  and  coordinates  among  software  agents  through  independent  analysis and negotiation of constraints.    Soroor,  Tarokh  and  Shemshadi  (2009)  devise  an  innovative  model  based  on  Intelligent  Wireless  Web  (IWW) service for a mobile realtime supply chain coordination system. They utilize the capabilities IWW  services  which  allows  access  to  information  anywhere  at  any  time  to  effectively  integrate  information  and  material  flows  within  a  supply  chain.  Soroor,  Tarokh  and  Shemshadi  (2009)  exploit  and  converge  existing  technologies  to  implement  a  system  that  can  deliver  IWW  support  to  a  supply  chain,  and  suggest the benefits for improved productivity, cost reduction, and customer service are enormous.    Sarmah,  Acharya  and  Goyal  (2008)  further  extend  work  beyond  one  manufacturer/supplier  and/or  one  retailer in a two level supply chain. They study a supply chain in which there is a single manufacturer and  multiple,  nonidentical,  buyers.  Sarmah,  Acharya  and  Goyal  (2008)  also  focus  on  how  negotiations  can  be  realized  to  further  reduce  costs  and  increase  savings  for  the  participants  in  the  supply  chain.  Furthermore,  Ding  and  Chen  (2008)  study  coordination  in  a  three  level  supply  chain.  They  consider  a  product  with  a  short  life  cycle  in  a  single  period  model.  Ding  and  Chen  (2008)  construct  a  flexible  return  policy and show that a three level supply chain can be fully coordinated.    24   

Similar to Xiao, Qi and Yu (2007) and Xiao and Qi (2008), Chen and Xiao  (2009) investigate supply  chains  coordination  with  demand  disruptions.  However,  their  work  considers  supply  chains  with  one  manufacturer and multiple retailers containing one dominant retailer.    There  are  numerous  research  and  studies  in  the  literature  that  discuss  multibuyers  and  three  level  supply chains; however, these shall be omitted in this review.    2.1.2  Issue of Imperfect Quality    This  section  will  explore  the  issue  of  imperfect  quality  on  lot  size  policies  and  coordination  in  supply  chains.    Rosenblatt  and  Lee  (1986)  investigates  the  effect  of  an  imperfect  production  process  on  the  optimal  production cycle time. They derive a modified economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) formula for both  the  cases  of  dynamic  nature  of  deterioration  where  the  process  is  assumed  to  deteriorate  linearly  and  after  a  certain  time  where  it  assumes  an  exponential  deterioration.  Furthermore,  Rosenblatt  and  Lee  (1986)  derive  a  generalized  model  for  the  case  where  there  are  multiple  states  of  the  process  and  deterioration follows a stepwise manner. The key assumption to the work of Rosenblatt and Lee (1986)  is  that  at  the  beginning  of  the  production  cycle,  items  of  perfect  quality  are  being  produced  and  the  process  is  identified  as  `incontrol  state'.  However,  as  time  progresses,  the  process  deteriorates  and  begins  to  produce  a  proportion  of  defective  items  and  the  process  is  said  to  be  in  an  `outofcontrol  state'.  Equally  important  is  the  assumption  that  at  the  beginning  of  each  cycle  the  process  is  `incontrol'  as  a  result  of  some  maintenance  or  restoration  process  that  is  part  of  the  setup  process.  These  aforementioned  assumptions  provide  the  initial  foundation  to  which  most  following  research  base  their  investigations  upon.  Rosenblatt  and  Lee  (1986)  provide  numerical  examples  to  illustrate  the  derivation  of the optimal production cycle times for each assumed situation and show that this optimal production  cycle  time  derived  is  shorter  than  that  of  the  classical  EMQ  model.  Principally,  it  decreases  as  the  defective rate or the cost of the defective items increases.    Of  equal  importance  to  the  emergence  of  research  regarding  imperfect  quality  items  in  supply  chain  is  the  work  of  Porteus  (1986).  The  objective  of  the  work  of  Porteus  (1986)  is  to  demonstrate  that  lower  setup  costs  can  benefit  production  systems  by  improving  quality  control.  Porteus  (1986)  does  this  by  25   

introducing a simple model that portrays the significant relationship between quality and lot size. Similar  to  Rosenblatt  and  Lee  (1986),  Porteus  (1986)  suggests  that  a  process  is  incontrol  at  start.  However,  Porteus (1986) assumes that there is a probability, with each item it produces, that the process can shift  to  an  outofcontrol  of  state.  Again  similar  to  Rosenblatt  and  Lee  (1986),  Porteus  (1986)  assumes  once  the  process  is  outofcontrol  it  remains  as  such  until  the  end  of  the  lot  where  a  setup  is  performed  by  which the process is restored to an incontrol state. In the model of Porteus (1986), the system incurs an  additional  cost  for  rework  and  related  operations  for  each  defective  item  it  produces.  In  essence,  this  creates  an  incentive  to  produce  smaller  lots  and  hence  have  smaller  fraction  of  defectives.  Porteus  (1986)  introduces  three  options  for  investing  in  quality  improvement:  reducing  the  probability  that  the  process will shift outofcontrol, reducing setup costs, and simultaneously doing both.    Khouja  and  Mehrez  (1994)  aim  to  extend  the  classical  economic  production  lot  size  (EPL)  models  to  cases  where:  the  production  rate  is  a  decision  variable,  the  unit  production  cost  a  function  of  the  production  rate,  and  the  quality  of  the  production  process  deteriorate  with  an  increase  in  production  rate.  In  consistency  with  the  aforementioned  assumptions  of  a  process  being  incontrol  and  shifting  to  an outofcontrol state, Khouja and  Mehrez  (1994)  develop a model and solve it numerically. They show  that when the optimal production rate is smaller than the rate that minimizes unit production cost, then  an increase in the production rate will lead to a significant deterioration in quality. However, in the cases  where  the  optimal  production  rate  may  be  larger  than  the  rate  that  minimizes  the  unit  production  cost,  quality is considered for the most part independent of the production rate.    Analyzing  the  interactions  between  quality  defaults  and  workinprocess  (WIP)  is  the  purpose  of  the  study  of  Cordon  (1995).  Cordon  (1995)  presents  a  model  and  the  outcome  effects  between  WIP  and  quality  defects  are  evaluated.  Key  assumptions  to  this  study  include  arrival  of  defective  items  be  Markovian,  defective  items  are  reworked  or  substituted  by  good  ones,  and  defects  produced  in  one  station can only be detected at the next station. Cordon (1995) shows that under general conditions the  inventory  between  two  stations  will  continue  to  grow  infinitely  for  any  given  failure  rate.  This  indicates  that  the  expected  throughput  is  not  necessarily  increased  by  increasing  the  WIP  inventory  buffer  and  provides justification for the practice of limiting inventory through justintime (JIT) policy.    Agnihothri  and  Kenett  (1995)  investigate  and  present  the  impact  of  defects  on  system  performance  measures  for  a  production  process  with  100%  inspection  followed  by  rework.  System  performance  26   

measures  of  consideration  included  yield,  production  lead  time  and  workinprocess  inventory.  Agnihothri  and  Kenett  (1995)  develop  a  mathematical  model  and  apply  simulation  to  achieve  their  objective.  Agnihothri  and  Kenett  (1995)  model  the  number  of  defects  as  a  random  variable  having  any  general  discrete  distribution.  Moreover,  defects  are  defined  and  classified  one  at  a  time  and  the  manufacturing  process  is  under  statistical  control  and  hence  defects  are  independent  of  each  other.  Other  assumptions  include  the  arrival  rate  of  items  following  a  Poisson  process,  each  workcenter  consisting  of  multiple  parallel  servers,  service  times  for  each  workcenter  are  assumed  independent  random  variables  with  exponential  distributions,  unlimited  buffer  space  for  each  workcenter,  first comefirstserve service discipline implemented at all workcenters, the servers at the inspection and re work  centers  are  perfect  and  the  system  is  under  steadystate.    Agnihothri  and  Kenett  (1995)  provide  management  guidelines  for  short  term  control  decisions  such  as  identifying  bottlenecks  and  assigning  additional  resources  to  discharge  bottlenecks.  In  addition,  Agnihothri  and  Kenett  (1995)  propose  a  budget  allocation  method  for  process  improvement  projects  to  meet  long  term  objectives  to  decrease  the number of defectives.    Urban  (1998)  formulated  appropriate  models  to  account  for  either  positive  or  negative  learning  effects  in production processes. Urban (1998) achieves this by developing a model that takes into consideration  the  interaction  between  lot  size  and  the  defective  rate.  It  is  assumed  that  the  defect  rate  of  the  process  is  modeled  as  a  function  of  the  run  length.  From  Urban's  (1998)  conclusions  is  that  when  there  is  a  significant  inverse  relationship  between  run  length  and  product  quality,  the  lot  sizes  of  considerably  smaller size are more suitable, whether with or without reduction in setup costs.    Goyal  et  al.  (2003)  assume  defective  items  are  produced  throughout  a  production  process  and  that  items of poor quality detected in the screening process of a lot are sold at a discounted price. They apply  these  assumptions  in  developing  a  simple  approach  to  determine  an  optimal  integrated  vendorbuyer  inventory  policy  for  an  item  with  imperfect  quality.  The  objective  is  to  minimize  the  total  joint  annual  costs  sustained  by  both  the  vendor  and  buyer.  Goyal  et  al.  (2003)  derive  an  annual  integrated  total  cost  function  and  provide  a  numerical  example  to  illustrate  the  proposed  solution  procedure  to  determine  the  optimal  policy.  It  is  concluded  that  as  the  holding  cost  for  the  buyer  increases,  the  number  of  shipments  per  lot  will  increase.  Correspondingly,  when  the  holding  cost  for  the  vendor  increases,  the  number of shipments per lot will decrease.    27   

Khouja  (2003)  investigate  and  solve  a  twostage  supply  chain  inventory  model  involving  a  producer  and  retailer,  in  which  the  proportion  of  defective  products  increases  with  increased  production  lot  sizes.  Khouja (2003) considers both deterministic and stochastic demand. The following key assumptions were  assumed  for  the  investigation:  the  producer  produces  the  product  on  a  single  machine,  the  production  and  usage  rates  are  deterministic  and  constant,  both  the  producer  and  the  retailer  incur  linear  holding  costs  on  inventory,  and  materials  are  inspected  and  reworked  if  needed  at  the  producer's  site.  Khouja  (2003)  derives  closed  form  expressions  and  presents  numerical  examples  for  the  model  formulated.  Some  findings  from  Khouja  (2003)  include  showing  that  quality  considerations  can  lead  to  significant  reduction  in  product  lot  sizes,  and  that  the  inclusion  of  rework  cost  can  lead  to  large  reduction  in  the  production lot sizes of suppliers and may lead to complete synchronization of the supply chain.    Khouja  (2005)  reformulates  some  inventory  models  which  take  into  account  the  negative  relationship  between lot size and quality. Further, Khouja (2005) considers the possibility of performing minor setups  within  each  cycle.  In  addition  to  assumptions  proposed  in  Khouja  (2003),  Khouja  (2005)  assume  defective  units  are  reworked  at  a  fixed  cost  per  unit,  minor  setups  are  equally  spaced  within  the  production  cycle,  and  that  the  quality  assumptions  used  are  those  previously  proposed  by  Porteus  (1986) and Rosenblatt and Lee (1986). The models reformulated by Khouja (2005) allow for adjustments  to  the  process  within  a  production  cycle  to  restore  it  to  an  incontrol  state.  These  adjustments  can  be  performed  without  interrupting  the  system  or  may  require  system  stoppage  and  can  be  thought  of  as  minor  setups.  Khouja  (2005)  derived  closed  form  expressions  for  the  optimal  lot  sizes  and  the  optimal  number  of  minor  setups  under  both  instantaneous  and  non  noninstaneous  minor  setups.  For  both  cases,  the  incorporation  of  minor  setups  leads  to  an  increased  optimal  lot  size  and  improved  yield.  Khouja (2005) provides numerical examples to illustrate the developed models.    El Saadany and Jaber (2008) investigate the work of Khouja (2005) in a centralized decision model where  participants in a twolevel (manufacturerretailer) supply chain coordinate their orders to minimize their  local costs and that of the chain. The model of El Saadany and Jaber (2008) adopts the approximation for  defective  items  suggested  by  Porteus  (1986)  and  follows  the  recommendations  of  Khouja  (2005)  to  this  approximation.  They  assume  the  manufacturer  performs  minor  setups,  of  equal  length  and  equally  spaced,  to  restore  the  production  process  to  an  incontrol  state.  El  Saadany  and  Jaber  (2008)  develop  mathematical  models  and  present  numerical  examples  with  discussions.  They  have  developed  models  for  three  cases.  When  there  is  no  coordination  and  the  manufacturer's  inventory  either  follows  the  28   

cases  where  the  process  is  restored  after  delivering  a  lot  to  the  retailer  or  when  the  process  is  restored  before  delivering  a  lot  to  the  retailer,  it  is  optimal  to  not  perform  any  minor  setups  for  restoration.  However,  if  there  is  coordination  and  the  process  is  restored  at  any  time  during  the  production,  then  it  is more optimal to perform minor setups as it will reduce holding and reworking costs.    Wang  et  al.  (2009)  develop  an  integrated  model  for  the  joint  determination  of  both  economic  production  quantity  (EPQ)  and  preventive  maintenance  (PM).  They  consider  the  situations  of  an  imperfect process with imperfect maintenance and inspection time. The objective of the model of Wang  et  al.  (2009)  is  to  minimize  the  expected  total  cost.  They  investigate:  optimal  EPQ,  the  optimal  number  of inspections, optimal inspection periods and optimal PM policy in a Weibull shock model.    2.1.3  Consignment Stock Coordination    Section  1.2.5  briefly  introduces  the  concept  of  the  consignment  stock  policy  and  its  introduction  as  a  new  strategy  in  coordinating  inventory  models.  This  section  will  review  research  within  the  literature  that investigates and discusses this relatively new supply chain coordination policy.    Braglia and Zavanella (2003) point out that the consignment stock strategy was observed as an industrial  practice  in  the  automotive  manufacturing  environment.  Although  the  concept  of  consignment  stock  is  not new, it is their work that provides an initial foundation for most of the later work with regards to the  consignment  stock  policy.  In  fact,  the  mathematical  model  from  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003)  will  be  considered  the  base  model  for  which  this  study  shall  build  and  expand  upon.  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003)  seek  to  understand  the  potentiality  of  the  consignment  stock  policy  by  providing  analytical  modeling.  They  consider  the  problem  of  a  singlevendor  and  singlebuyer  supply  chain  situation.  Not  only  does  Braglia  and  Zavenella  (2003)  develop  a  model,  but  furthermore  they  provide  a  comparison  with  the  classical  model  of  Hill  (1997,  1999)  and  concluding  with  a  proposal  for  identifying  situations  in  which  the  consignment  stock  policy's  implementation  could  be  advantageous.  In  general,  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003)  conclude  that  the  consignment  stock  policy  might  be  a  strategic  and  profitable  approach  to  supply  chain  in  coordination  in  situations  where  delivery  lead  times  or  market  demands  vary  with  respect  to  time.  Further  discussion  and  details  of  the  model  developed  by  Braglia  and  Zavanella (2003) will be presented in Chapter 3 of this thesis.    29   

Zanoni  and  Grubbström  (2004)  extend  upon  the  work  of  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003).  They  develop  an  explicit form of the implicit analytical solution given in Braglia and Zavanella (2003). The results obtained  with  their  derived  formula  were  shown  to  be  consistent  with  the  numerical  outcomes  proposed  by  Braglia and Zavanella (2003) in the original solution.    Persona,  Grassi  and  Catena  (2005)  propose  an  analytical  model  to  take  into  account  the  effects  of  obsolescence  in  a  supply  chain  managed  with  a  consignment  stock  policy.  The  analytical  model  is  based  on  the  deterministic  singlevendor  singlebuyer  productive  situation  proposed  by  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003).  The  model  of  Persona,  Grassi  and  Catena  (2005)  allows  identification  of  the  optimal  inventory  level  and  shipment  policy  for  optimizing  (minimizing)  total  costs  when  products  are  characterized  by  a  finite  lifetime.  Persona,  Grassi  and  Catena  (2005)  perform  simulations  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  stochastic  estimation  of  the  item  lifetime  period.  Conclusions  from  Persona,  Grassi  and  Catena  (2005)  indicate  that  the  presence  of  obsolescence  reduces  the  optimal  inventory  level,  especially  in  situations  where  the  products  have  a  short  lifetime.  Moreover,  the  effects  of  obsolescence  on  the  correct  estimation of the optimal shipment are higher when the production is rate is closer to the demand rate.  The simulations show that the optimal shipment for cases of stochastic lifetime is always smaller than of  those  of  the  deterministic  case.  They  also  show,  with  respect  to  the  deterministic  case,  that  the  higher  the uncertainty of estimating the product lifetime, the lower the optimal shipment. Furthermore, results  point out that there is no relation between the number of deliveries and total costs.    Wallin  et  al.,  (2006)  seek  to  identify  and  explain  the  critical  factors  that  steer  the  decision  how  a  firm  should  choose  between  one  of  four  choices  that  is  most  appropriate  to  adopt.  The  four  choices  are:  inventory  speculation,  inventory  postponement,  inventory  consignment  and  reverse  inventory  consignment.  Wallin  et  al.  (2006)  do  this  by  reviewing  relevant  literature  to  derive  subjective  observations.  Their  comparison  is  based  on  three  critical  factors:  customer  demand  or  usage  requirements,  nature  of  the  supply  chain,  and  bargaining  power  of  a  firm  relative  to  the  supplier.  From  the  conclusions  of  Wallin  et  al.  (2006)  are  guidelines  as  to  when  the  inventory  consignment  approach  is  to  be  used.  Summarizing  their  findings  under  the  three  critical  factors  for  comparison,  the  inventory  consignment approach is to be used when:   Customer requirements:  ... it is difficult to predict customer demand  ... there are rapidly changing customer preferences  30   

-

...  customer  ordertodelivery  lead  time  is  less  than  the  sum  of  the  supplier  orderto fulfillment leadtime, the firm's cycle time and the deliverytocustomer leadtime 



Nature of the supply chain:  ... there is an unreliable supply line  ... there is unpredictable delivery and quantity performance 



Bargaining power:  ... there are many suppliers to choose from  ... the supplier provides a nonunique product 

  Srinivas  and  Rao  (2007)  develop  an  inventory  model  where  the  replenishment  lead  time  is  assumed  to  be  dependant.  Srinivas  and  Rao  (2007)  consider  the  case  of  a  singlevendor  singlebuyer  scenario  under  stochastic  nature  in  both  the  classical  and  consignment  stock  coordination  models  and  seek  to  determine an efficient ordering strategy. Numerical examples are provided.    In  another  research,  Srinivas  and  Rao  (2007)  also  develop  and  solve  a  controllableleadtime  inventory  model  where  the  lead  time  is  assumed  to  be  dependant,  however,  this  time  using  a  genetic  algorithm.  Four  models  were  developed:  a  basic  consignment  stock  model,  consignment  stock  policy  with  delays,  consignment  stock policy  with information sharing and delays, and finally consignment stock policy with  lead  time.  They  present  numerical  examples  to  illustrate  the  solution  procedures  for  the  developed  models.    Battini  et  al.  (2010)  extend  the  work  of  Persona  et  al.  (2005).  They  consider  new  critical  factors  that  are  present  in  several  industrial  environments,  specifically,  demand  variability,  stockout  risk  and  limited  warehouse  space.  With  regards  to  performing  feasibility  studies  for  supply  chains  to  shift  from  a  traditional  inventory  management  policy  to  a  consignment  stock  policy  they  have  developed  and  presented  a  methodological  framework.  Battini  et  al.  (2010)  suggest  their  model  can  be  applied  to  manage  inventories  of  consumable  items  that  are  characterized  with  low  unit  costs,  high  demand  and  are  small  in  size  or  easy  to  store.  For  such  items,  they  prove  their  model  to  be  effective  regardless  of  variable demand, obsolescence risk or space constraints available at the buyer's end.        31   

2.2   

Problem Definition 

As  presented  in  the  literature  review,  supply  chain  coordination  is  vital  to  the  success  of  any  business.   Furthermore,  its  optimization  is  essential  to  improve  a  business's  performance.  This  has  lead  to  the  extensive studies with regards to supply chain coordination in numerous as researchers try to formulate  realworld  behaviors  to  develop  better  understandings  of  scenarios  and  provide  accurate  information  for  correct  decision  making.  According  to  the  previous  classification  aforementioned  in  the  literature  review  to  classifying  supply  chain  models  into  twolevel,  threelevel  and  fourormore  level,  it  can  be  clearly  seen  that  most  of  the  research  and  models  has  been  developed  for  twolevel  supply  chains.  The  work  has  been  extended  to  three  and  fourormore  level  supply  chain  models,  however,  there  is  still  a  need to further investigate these models as their complexity remains an obstacle.    The  consignment  stock  is  an  industrial  strategy  for  inventory  management  in  supply  chains  that  may  be  a strategic and profitable approach to stock management in uncertain environments where delivery lead  times  and/or  market  demand  vary  over  time.  This  policy  as  a  strategic  method  for  coordinating  supply  chain  models  is  a  relatively  recent  development.  It  has  not  been  investigated  until  its  introduction  into  the  automobile  industry  and  moreover,  until  the  work  of  Braglia  and  Zavenella  (2003).  The  literature  shows  that  there  are  numerous  directions  of  research  to  address  the  consignment  stock  policy.  Further  relaxations  of  assumptions  are  required  to  allow  a  more  thorough  understanding  of  the  consignment  stock as a strategy, policy, its benefits, its drawbacks and implications, and implementation issues.    One  of  the  main  issues  that  have  been  addressed  within  supply  chain  coordination  is  the  issue  of  imperfect  production.  This  issue  has  been  addressed  throughout  supply  chain  coordination  models  in  numerous  aspects  as  discussed  in  the  literature  review;  however,  it  has  not  been  addressed  within  the  scope  of  a  consignment  stock  policy.  It  should  be  noted  that  Xu  and  Chen  (2006)  have  attempted  such  an  investigation.  They  seek  to  develop  a  consignment  stock  policy  model  with  defective  items.  Conversely  their  attempt  lacks  in  many  aspects  conceptually  and  mathematically.  They  provide  a  numerical  example  from  the  work  of  Salameh  and  Jaber  (2000)  with  no  reference  to  their  and  fail  to  apply  the  correction  by  Maddah  and  Jaber  (2008)  of  using  the  renewal  theory  in  the  model  initially  developed  by  Salameh  and  Jaber  (2000).  Furthermore,  the  work  of  Xu  and  Chen  (2006)  lacks  sufficient  explanation  and  modeling  to  portray  a  realworld  situation.  There  is  no  mention  in  their  work  to  the  handling of defective items asides a warranty cost attached to each item.  32   

The  emergence  of  the  consignment  stock  policy  and  its  use,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  investigation  concerning imperfect  production is the main driving  forces for this study. This  thesis seeks to expand on  the  model  developed  by  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003)  by  the  relaxation  of  the  assumption  of  a  perfect  production  process.  As  a  result  imperfect  items  will  be  introduced  into  the  supply  chain  and  their  implications  shall  be  addressed  with  respect  to  the  model  and  associated  managerial  decisions  for  the  supply chain.    2.3    The  main  goal  of  this  study  is  to  further  explore  the  modeling  of  the  `Consignment  Stock  Case'  as  presented  by  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003).  The  main  focus  is  to  expand  the  model  presented  in  their  literature  by  introducing  the  possibility  of  having  the  vendor  producing  imperfect  items.  This  will  allow  the  developed  model  to  represent  the  realworld  more  accurately.  It  also  will  open  further  managerial  decisions  to  be  made  and  provide  a  more  thorough  understanding  of  the  nature  of  the  consignment  stock policy.    Consequently, the following objectives are to be achieved through this study:    1. Develop  a  supply  chain  model  that  refers  to  the  problem  of  a  singlevendor  and  singlebuyer  productive situation that portrays the consignment stock policy subject to:  a. Imperfect production  b. Managerial decisions to scrap or rework imperfect items  c. Application of minor setups for restoration    2. Develop  insights  concerning  the  behavior  of  the  model  with  regards  to  fluctuations  in  demand,  unit price, and product quality    3. Provide  a  tool  for  management  to  use  to  assist  in  supply  chain  managerial  decisions  for  determining production policies for prespecified production scenarios          33    Research Objectives

Model Concept 

This  chapter  discusses  the  developed  model  from  its  conceptual  design  to  its  implementation  highlighting  the  construction  process  of  the  model  and  its  mathematical  formulation.  The  chapter  is  divided  such  that  it  first  introduces  the  scope  of  the  model  where  a  clear  understanding  of  the  real world  situation  is  introduced  and  the  limitations  of  the  study  and  modeling.  Then  a  conceptual  design  is  presented  providing  a  rationale  for  the  model  and  the  foundation  for  the  mathematical  modeling.  The  second  half  of  the  chapter  shall  present  the  construction  process  of  the  model.  The  model  construction  is  split  into  three  phases.  For  each  phase,  the  assumptions  presented  and  mathematical  modeling  discussed.    3.1.1  Scope of the Model  The  situation  considered  is  the  problem  of  a  singlevendor  singlebuyer  supply  chain  scenario.  Coordination  between  these  two  participants  will  be  in  the  form  of  a  consignment  stock  policy.  This  form  of  strategic  coordination  requires  continuous  exchange  of  information  between  both  the  vendor  and  the  buyer.  The  vendor  will  produce  items  and  later  ship  them  to  be  stored  at  the  buyer's  warehouse.  This  warehouse  is  close  to  the  buyer's  production  line  so  that  material  may  be  picked  up  when  needed.  A  radical  application  of  the  consignment  stock  policy  may  lead  to  having  no  inventory  stored at the vendor's side as the vendor will seek to utilize the buyer's warehouse to stock material.  34   

 
Figure 3.1  Schematic representing a singlevendor singlebuyer supply chain concept 

  In this type of coordination, the vendor will guarantee that the quantity stored in the buyer's warehouse  will  be  kept  within  a  maximum  and  minimum  level,  also  accounting  for  any  additional  costs  induced  by  stockout  situations.  The  buyer  will  withdraw  the  required  items  to  cover  production  from  the  buyer's  warehouse,  and  the  vendor  will  be  paid  for  the  items  withdrawn  by  the  retailer  (buyer).  This  consumption  on  behalf  of  the  buyer  demands  for  accurate  and  fast  transmission  of  information  between both participants of the supply chain.    To  complete  the  overall  conceptual  picture  of  the  consignment  stock  policy  under  study,  the  following  must be noted with regards to both the buyer and vendor (Braglia and Zavanella, 2003):   With regards to the buyer  Has a constant guaranteed minimum stock level  Does not have to take care of order emission costs (excluding administrative costs)  Pays  for  items  only  when  they  are  effectively  used  (excluding  the  quantity  of  frozen  capital)   Does not pay for capitallinked holding costs (charged to the vendor) 

With regards to the vendor  Has access to the final demand  Has  the  opportunity  to  empty  his  warehouse  (which  could  be  used  for  other  tasks)  ­  depending on the relative values of certain parameters in the supply chain  May  be  more  flexible  in  organizing  production  schemes  differently,  being  less  closely  linked to the buyer's requirements 

  Pertaining  to  the  maximum  and  minimum  inventory  levels  of  the  buyer  that  shall  be  guaranteed  by  the  vendor, there may be conflict of interest between the vendor and the buyer. The vendor will seek to set  35   

the  minimum  stock  level  as  low  as  possible  to  reduce  the  cost  of  safety  stock,  and  will  try  to  set  the  maximum  level  as  high  as  possible  to  take  advantage  of  production  until  the  buyer's  warehouses  are  full.  Conversely,  the  buyer  will  seek  to  set  a  higher  level  of  minimum  stock  to  reduce  the  probability  of  stockout (regardless of the fact such costs will be charged to the vendor as aforementioned). The buyer  will  also  seek  to  set  the  maximum  inventory  level  as  low  as  possible  to  reduce  occupied  space  and  the  relative costs linked to investment in structures.    As  mentioned  in  the  previous  chapters,  the  consignment  stock  policy  is  seen  to  be  a  strategic  and  profitable  to  stock  management  in  uncertain  environments  where  delivery  lead  times  and/or  markets  demands  fluctuate.  Furthermore,  another  important  benefit  to  be  highlighted  is  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  bullwhip  effect.  It  should  be  noted  that  this  reduction  or  elimination  is  not  attributed  to  the  consignment  stock  policy  as  it  is  to  the  strategic  partnership  and  communication  between  the  buyer and vendor, which is obligatory to the consignment stock policy being implemented.    3.1.2  Conceptual Design    This  study  is  concerned  with  further  exploration  of  the  consignment  stock  strategies  and  its  potentials.  Conceptually, the study will be based on the singlevendor singlebuyer supply chain model developed in  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003).  This  model  will  then  be  modified  to  account  for  the  possibility  of  an  imperfect  production  process  and  hence  production  of  imperfect  items.  This  modified  model  will  also  take  into  account  for  managerial  decisions  associated  with  the  new  supply  chain  model  with  regards  to  storage  and  disposal  of  imperfect  items.  The  development  of  the  modifications  to  be  made  to  the  base  model  is  to  be  performed  in  stages.  Finally,  a  new  model  will  be  developed  based  on  the  modified  models to include the concept of minor setups for restoration of the process.    3.2    The  construction  of  the  model  will  be  categorized  into  three  phases.  Phase  1  describes  the  base  model  as  presented  by  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003).  The  modification  of  the  base  model  will  be  considered  `Phase  2'.  Finally,  the  development  of  the  new  model  with  minor  setups  for  restoration  of  the  process  will  be  categorized  as  `Phase  3'.  Table  3.1  summarizes  the  phases  and  the  stages  of  development  of  the  models.  36    Model Construction

  3.2.1  PHASE 1  Base Model  Braglia and Zavenella (2003)    The  following  section  will  illustrate  the  concepts,  assumptions  and  mathematics  of  the  base  model  as  illustrated by Braglia and Zavanella (2003).    Concept  We have a singlevendor (manufacturer) singlebuyer situation where:         The manufacturer produces a predefined production batch  Upon completion of the batch, the batch is shipped instantaneously to the buyer  The buyer begins to consume  Simultaneously, the manufacturer is producing a new batch  Once it is complete, the batch is shipped to the buyer (instantaneously)  The manufacturer repeats until the total number of required items are shipped to the buyer  The  buyer  consumes  all  the  items  before  reordering  a  new  order  (and  hence  beginning  a  new  cycle)    37   

The  decision  variables  are  to  determine  the  batch  size  and  the  number  of  shipments  to  be  made  per  cycle.    Notation                      Assumptions  It  should  be  emphasized  that  in  the  consignment  stock  policy,  the  buyer  pays  an  order  emission  cost  every time inventory is withdrawn/consumed from the stock (Valentini and Zavanella, 2003)        Mathematical Model  The average setup cost per year (vendor's side) is given by:      The average holding costs per year (vendor's side) is given by:      The average order emission costs per year (buyer's side) is given by:               38              [3.03]

Figure 3.2  Inventory behavior of the Base Model (the model of Braglia and Zavanella, 2003) 

Figure  3.2  illustrates  the  inventory  behavior  at  both  the  vendor  and  buyer  sides  of  the  modeled  system.  Items are produced at the vendor's side during a specified production time. Once the batch is complete,  it  is  shipped  immediately  to  the  vendor.  As  the  vendor  consumes  the  items  at  a  rate  slower  than  the  production  rate  another  batch  shipment  is  received  after  the  same  specified  production  time.  As  this  is  repeated  for  the  production  cycle,  the  inventory  is  accumulated  at  the  vendor's  side  until  it  is  finally  depleted.  Cycles  i-1  and  i+1  are  represented  in  Figure  3.2  only,  but  they  follow  for  all  following  figures  illustrating inventory behavior.  39   

3.2.2  PHASE 2  Modifications to the Base Model    The following section will introduce, through gradual stages, the modifications made to the base model.    3.2.2.1  Stage 1  Base Model + Considers Production Cost of Produced Items    Concept  The first modification performed to the base model is the inclusion of production cost to the model. This  modification  is  seen  compulsory  to  the  further  modifications  that  are  to  be  included  regarding  the  introduction  of  the  imperfect  processing  and  the  possibility  of  producing  imperfect  items.  It  is  only  common sense to include production costs if the considerations of quality costs are to be included.    The inventory behavior is the same, as the base model, and so is the mathematics with  the  exception of  an additional cost component to account for the production cost.    Notation        Assumptions     Mathematical Model  The average production costs per year (vendor's side) is given by:      The total cycle time is given by:      The total cost per year for the system is the sum of the previous costs and can be stated as:                    [3.08]                        [3.07]                       [3.06]  The cost or producing one unit under regular production is assumed constant        unit production cost for regular production  total cycle time                     [$/item]  [year] 

40   

Inventory Behavior  There is no change in the inventory behavior from that presented in the base model.    3.2.2.2  Stage 2  Base Model + Production cost + Introduction of Imperfect Production    Concept  It  is  important  to  highlight  an  important  difference  from  this  modified  model,  to  the  models  previously  presented;  that  is,  the  production  batch  quantity  produced  by  the  manufacturer  is  different  from  the  quantity  shipped  to  the  buyer.  This  is  a  result  from  a  100%  inspection  process  performed  at  the  vendor  that ensures only items of perfect quality will only be shipped to the buyer.    The  concept  is  that  as  the  production  process  is  running,  there  is  a  probability  that  this  process  run  out ofcontrol;  that  is  the  process  may  produce  items  that  do  not  conform  to  quality  standards  defined  by  the  process.  Similar  to  the  work  of Porteus  (1986),  the  process  once  outofcontrol  it  will  remain  outof control  until  a  setup  is  performed  that  includes  a  correction  process  to  restore  the  process  back  to  control.    Notation            Assumptions      100% inspection performed at the manufacturer (vendor) and is instantaneous  Inspection cost is assumed to be negligible and hence not considered  The production batch quantity is constant for all batches  , that is  the number of items shipped in a batch   is  always less than  the  number of items  produced by the respective production batch     is  an  exponential  relationship  that  captures  the  behavior  of  imperfect  items  illustrated  in  Porteus (1986) and Rosenblatt and Lee (1986)     41               production batch quantity for regular production      [items]

Mathematical Model    For the first production batch, the number of imperfect items can be approximated by:      Hence, the number of items shipped in the first batch can be represented as:      For the second production batch, the number of imperfect items can be approximated by:      And the number of items shipped in the second batch would be given as:      Similarly, for the third batch:        Therefore it can be generalized that for batch  :        Correspondingly,  the  total  number  of  imperfect  items  resulting  from  regular  production  for  each  cycle  can be approximated by:      Since  the  number  of  items  in  a  batch  shipped  to  the  buyer  has  been  adjusted  as  a  result  of  imperfect  items,  and  other  aforementioned  modifications,  the  cost  components  of  the  system  requires  modifications.    42    1               [3.17]                                    [3.15]  [3.16]  3 3                                       [3.13]  [3.14]                       [3.12]  2 2                  [3.11]                       [3.10]                     [3.09] 

The total cycle time is now given by:      The batch production time can be given as:      The average setup cost per year (vendor's side) is given by:      The average holding costs per year (vendor's side) is given by:      The average order emission costs per year (buyer's side) is given by:      The average holding costs per year (buyer's side) is given by:      Note that (from the geometry of the graph illustrating the inventory behavior):            The average production costs per year (vendor's side) is given by:                              [3.26]                   ,  1              [3.25]                  [3.24]

Correspondingly,  the  total  cost  per  year  for  the  system  is  the  sum  of  the  previous  costs  and  can  be  stated as:      Inventory Behavior    Figure  3.3  illustrates  the  inventory  behavior  of  the  model  under  the  aforementioned  scenario.  The  general  concept  is  the  same  as  explained  for  the  behavior  of  the  inventory  model  for  Figure  3.1;  however,  as  a  result  of  an  imperfect  production  process,  defective  items  are  produced.  These  are  not  shipped.  As  the  process  continues,  more  and  more  defective  items  are  produced.  This  allows  for  each  batch shipped having different number of items within, although the production batch is the same.                    [3.27]

3.2.2.3  Stage  3    Base  Model  +  Production  cost  +  Imperfect  Production  +  Considers  Holding  of  Imperfect Items to End of Production Cycle    Concept  The model presented in Stage 2 can be related to a situation where a manufacturer internally recycles or  disposes  of  the  imperfect  items  for  no  extra  costs.  However,  in  general,  this  is  not  the  case.  For  this  reason,  the  modification  in  this  stage  of  the  model  is  to  include  the  consideration  and  costs  of  holding  the  imperfect  items  until  the  end  of  the  production  cycle.  Later  on,  in  the  upcoming  modeling  stages,  managerial decisions as to how to manage these imperfect items shall be considered.    Assumptions   The  unit  holding  cost  for  an  imperfect  item  is  equivalent  to  the  holding  cost  of  a  conforming  item    Mathematical Model  The  model  in  this  case  is  exactly  that  of  the  model  in  Stage  2;  however,  an  extra  cost  component  must  be included to account for the holding cost of imperfect items.    The average holding costs of imperfect items per year (vendor's side) is given by:      Correspondingly,  the  total  cost  per  year  for  the  system  is  the  sum  of  the  previous  costs  and  can  be  stated as:                                [3.29]                        [3.28] 

45   

Inventory Behavior  Figure  3.4  illustrates  the  inventory  behavior  of  the  current  model  is  very  similar  to  that  of  Stage  2,  however,  there  is  an  additional  representation  at  the  vendor's  side  for  the  storage  of  the  imperfect  items.

3.2.2.4  Stage  4   Base  Model  +  Production  Cost  +  Imperfect  Production  +  Holding  of  Imperfect  Items  +  Consideration of Scrapping Cost    Concept  The  model  in  stage  3  cannot  be  considered  as  a  model  to  accurately  represent  a  realworld  situation.  The reason being that in  the model of  Stage 3, the imperfect items that are being held to the end of the  production  have  not  been  used,  shipped,  or  disposed  of.  Hence,  in  Stage  4,  the  model  is  modified  to  include scrapping cost. That is considering the disposal of the imperfect items, whether at a cost, or sold  to a secondary market for a profit.    Notation      Assumptions   Profit  made  from  selling  imperfect  items  should  always  be  less  than  the  profit  from  selling  an  item that has been labeled as conforming to standards    Mathematical Modeling  This  model  is  the  same  as  the  model  of  Stage  3,  however,  an  additional  cost  component  is  to  be  added  to account for the cost scrapping items.    The average scrapping cost of imperfect items per year (vendor's side) is given by:      Correspondingly,  the  total  cost  per  year  for  the  system  is  the  sum  of  the  previous  costs  and  can  be  stated as:      Inventory Behavior  The behavior of the inventory is exactly the same as represented in Stage 4.

47   

3.2.2.5  Stage  5   Base  Model  +  Production  Cost  +  Imperfect  Production  +  Holding  of  Imperfect  Items  +  Scrapping Cost + ReWork for Imperfect Items    Concept  If imperfect items are stored until the end of the production cycle, as presented in the model in Stage 3,  there  are  managerial  decisions  to  be  made  regarding  them.  The  model  in  Stage  4  has  illustrated  one  scenario  in  which  the  imperfect  items  are  to  be  scrapped,  whether  at  a  cost  or  for  a  marginal  profit.  However,  another  possibility  exists,  and  that  is  to  rework  the  imperfect  items.  The  modification  to  the  model  in  this  stage  allows  for  a  single  rework  process  to  be  performed.  After  rework,  the  items  are  considered  as  good  or  imperfect.  The  imperfect  items  will  then  be  scrapped  similarly  to  what  has  been  presented in the model in Stage 4.    Notation              Assumptions       Mathematical Modeling  As a result of the reworking process, the number of items to be scrapped is changed and in essence the  formula  representing  the  average  scrapping  cost  of  imperfect  items  per  year  (vendor's  side)  is  also  modified.  The  imperfect  items,  ,  will  be  reworked  once,  and  go  through  another  100%  inspection  process  whereby  the  rejected  items,  denoted  as  ,  will  be  considered  imperfect  items  to  be  scrapped  and the remaining good items,  , will be shipped in a separate batch to the vendor.    Imperfect items are only reworked at the end of the regular production cycle  The rework process is subject to imperfect production similar to the regular production  Imperfect items are reworked once             total number of imperfect items after rework production  total number of imperfect items after rework production          [items]  [items]

Correspondingly,  the  total  number  of  imperfect  items  resulting  at  the  end  of  the  rework  process  is  approximated by:      As  a  result  of  the  new  modification  in  the  behavior  of  the  inventory,  the  cost  component    no  longer                     [3.32] 

represents  the  average  holding  costs  per  year  (buyer's  side).  It  shall  be  replaced  in  the  total  cost  function  with  the  cost  component  denoted as:      Furthermore, the cost component   representing the average holding costs of imperfect items per year 


.  Therefore,  the  average  holding  costs  per  year  (buyer's  side)  is 

  

 

[3.33] 

(vendor's  side)  is  not  correct  as  it  does  not  account  for  the  holding  of  the  imperfect  items  as  they  are  undergoing rework. Therefore, a new cost component,  , will replace  of imperfect items per year (vendor's side) is now given by:      In  similar  fashion,  the  cost  component    will  now  be  replaced  with    and  the  average  scrapping  cost                     [3.34]   and the average holding costs 

of imperfect items per year (vendor's side) is given by:      We  also  have  an  additional  setup  cost,  ,  and  additional  production  cost,  ,  for  the  rework  batch,                        [3.35] 

as  well  as  an  additional  order  emission  cost,  following:

Correspondingly,  the  total  cost  per  year  for  the  system  is  the  sum  of  the  previous  costs  and  can  be  stated as:    49            [3.39] 

Inventory Behavior  Figure  3.5  illustrates  the  inventory  behavior  for  the  current  system  that  includes  reworking  of  the  imperfect  items.  The  inventory  behavior  is  similar  to  that  illustrated  in  Figure  3.3  with  the  addition  of  the  rework  that  is  performed  at  the  end  of  the  regular  production.  This  rework  is  illustrated  in  the  imperfect  items  chart  at  the  vendor's  side,  and  the  resulting  shipment  of  the  items  that  pass  the  quality  control screening is delivered to the buyer's inventory in a single delivery batch.

In  some  of  the  previous  stages  there  are  situations  where  scrapped  items  may  be  sold  for  a  marginal  profit  to  a  secondary  market.  It  only  makes  sense,  to  consider  the  original  items  sold  to  the  buyer  in  the  model  as  well  to  allow  for  fair  comparisons. The modification made to this model is a simple adjustment to account for the profit made  to the buyer from the sales of items. A sale occurs when the item is consumed by the buyer.    Notation        Assumptions     Mathematical Model  The unit purchase price for the buyer is a markup of the unit cost of that of the vendor and is given by:      The profit made by the vendor from the buyer can be illustrated as a negative cost. Accordingly, the cost  component that represents the profit made by the vendor from the buyer is represented as:      Correspondingly,  the  total  cost  per  year  for  the  system  is  the  sum  of  the  previous  costs  and  can  be  stated as:      It should be noted, that a negative value for the above cost equation implies a profit is made.    51           [3.42]

Inventory Behavior  The behavior of the inventory is exactly the same as that presented in Stage 5.    3.2.2.7  Stage 7  Modified Model    Concept  In  this  final  stage  of  Phase  2,  the  model  shall  be  modified  such  that  variables  with  binary  values  will  be  used to accommodate the various scenarios discussed in the previous stages of the model development.  The model is  basically formulated as presented in Stage 6, and based on the values of each variable; the  model can be reduced to any of the previous stages.

  Note  that  when  the  parameter    is  equal  to  zero,  all  the  terms  that  correspond  to  the  imperfect  items  and cost of imperfect items will reduce to zero. Therefore, taking into consideration the above table, the  mathematical model may be restated.

The total cost per year for the system is the sum of the previous costs and can be stated as:      Where:  The total cycle time is given by:      And the individual cost components are given as follows:    Average setup cost per year (vendor's side):       Average production cost per year (vendor's side):       Average order emission cost per year (buyer's side):       Average scrapping cost of imperfect items per year (vendor's side):  1   Average holding cost of items at manufacturer/vendor (vendor's side):         Average holding cost of imperfect items per year (vendor's side):                             [3.50]                    [3.49]                     [3.48]                    [3.47]                  [3.46]                    [3.45]

  3.2.3  PHASE 3 ­ Modified Model with Minor Setups for Restoration    Concept  The  idea  is  to  employ  a  minor  setup  upon  the  shipment  of  each  delivery.  This  minor  setup  occurs  at  a  cost  much  cheaper  than  a  regular  setup,  but  it  allows  the  process  to  be  restored  (in  terms  of  product  quality).  By  employing  minor  setups  it  is  perceived  to  reduce  the  number  of  imperfect  quality  items  produced and hence the overall cost of the system.    Assumptions  In  continuity  with  the  assumption  that  setups  are  instantaneous,  the  minor  setup  is  assumed  to  be  instantaneous as well.    Notation                  54      0,1    0 = nominor setups applied    1 = minor setups applied for restoration         factor to account for cost of minor setup from that of  shipped quantity per batch   (constant value)            [items]  [items] 

number of imperfect items per batch   (constant value)   

Mathematical Modeling  The  mathematical  modeling  of  the  system  remains  the  same  except  for  the  factors  that  represent  the  holding  cost  of  imperfect  items  at  the  vendor  as  well  as  the  additional  cost  required  for  the  minor  setups.    As the process is being restored at each shipment, the approximation for the number of imperfect items  will be the same and hence the shipped quantity per batch is also the same.    For simplicity reasons, the cost components used in the modified model (Phase 2, Stage 7) shall be kept,  however, the following adjustment shall be made:                  1                          1                   1    [3.57]    And similar to the modified model (Phase 2, Stage 7), the total cost per year for the system is the sum of  the previous costs and can be stated as:      Inventory Behavior  The  inventory  behavior  of  the  model  is  exactly  as  that  portrayed  in  Phase  2  Stage  6,  however,  the  inventory  of  the  imperfect  items  has  been  changed  as  a  result  of  the  minor  setups.  This  is  illustrated  in  Figure  3.6  for  the  more  comprehensive  case  where  rework  is  applied  at  the  end  of  the  regular  production.              [3.58]  [3.54]  [3.55]  [3.56]

  3.2.3  Model Finalization    The  objective  function  is  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  the  system.  However,  this  function  is  subject  to  a  quality  control  constraint.  It  is  assumed  that  there  is  a  given  quality  control  limit  for  each  production  batch. For example, a batch shipped should be at least 90% of the production batch.      56

    4.1  4.1.1  4.1.2  4.2  4.2.1  4.2.2  4.2.3      4.1    This  chapter  will  illustrate  the  application  of  the  model  to  various  production  cases  that  resemble  real world production scenarios. The model will seek to minimize the total cost under the different situations  presented  in  Chapter  3  with  an  emphasis  on  comparing  the  same  situation  with  and  without  minor  setups  for  restoration.  The  chapter  will  then  apply  some  sensitivity  analysis  to  the  comprehensive  production scenario to develop some insights.    4.1.1 Production Scenarios    In  order  to  validate  the  modifications  made  to  the  base  model,  two  production  scenarios  will  be  demonstrated by the model. These are the base model, that is the model of Braglia and Zavanella (2003)  and  the  same  model  when  production  cost  and  vendor  profit  from  selling  the  items  is  considered.  The  common  factor  in  these  two  models  is  that  imperfect  production  is  not  considered.  The  ensuing  production  scenarios  that  resemble  realworld  production  scenarios  for  comparisons  incorporate  the  concept  of  imperfect  production  in  its  production  process.

Table 4.3  Results for the various production scenarios that resemble the real world 

  The  result  for  Case  00i  yields  the  exact  same  results  as  presented  in  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003).  Case  00ii  is  the  same  model  but  with  the  application  of  minor  setups  for  restoration.  It  can  be  clearly  seen  that  this  model  is  less  optimal  (of  a  higher  cost)  when  the  minor  setups  for  restoration  are  applied.  This 

61   

is because there is an additional cost for the minor setups; however, there is no benefit gained from the  restoration of the process as there are no imperfect items and hence no associated costs.    Case  01i  and  Case  01ii  indicate  a  negative  cost  which  is  in  essence  a  profit  made  by  the  system  as  the  profit made by the vendor is taken into consideration. The values for   and   in case 01i are the same as  those  in  case  00i  as  there  is  no  change  in  the  policy,  only  a  change  in  the  incorporation  of  production  cost  and  the  consideration  of  vendor  profit.  Again,  it  can  be  seen  that  there  is  no  benefit  from  minor  restorations  as  evident  from  the  reduced  profit  shown  (a  less  negative  cost).  Once  again,  this  is  attributed  to  the  fact  no  costs  for  imperfect  items  are  considered.  For  this  reason,  it  is  vital  the  imperfect production be considered in future consignment stock models.    In  all  the  other  scenarios,  an  imperfect  production  process  is  considered  and  it  is  clearly  seen  there  is  a  benefit  from  applying  the  minor  restorations  to  restore  the  process.  It  is  also  notable,  that  the  highest  increase  from  the  application  of  minor  restorations  is  in  the  cases  where  rework  is  considered.  The  different  scenarios  that  consider  scrapping  at  a  cost,  or  no  cost,  or  sold  for  a  marginal  profit  to  a  secondary market have a small impact on the total cost of the system.    4.2    Case  C2i  and  C2ii  represent  the  most  comprehensive  case  of  the  different  production  scenarios.  It  shall  be  these  cases  in  which  the  model  shall  be  tested  for  different  values  of  ,  the values of    4.2.1  Variation of Demand    In  this  experiment,  the  values  used  are  the  exact  values  of  Case  C2i  and  C2ii  as  presented  earlier  in  Section  4.1.1,  however,  the  value  of  the  demand  shall  be  altered  to  vary  from  1000  to  3000  by  every  100.  There  is  no  need  to  vary  the  demand  beyond  3000  units  as  it  the  maximum  production  capacity  is  limited to 3200 units per year as given by Braglia and Zavanella (2003).

Table 4.4  Results for production scenarios C2i and C2ii when the demand is varied 

In  consistency  with  the  results  presented  in  section  4.1.2  there  is  always  a  larger  profit  made  (or  lower  cost)  when  minor  setups  for  restoration  are  applied.  As  the  demand  is  increased,  the  extra  profit  made  by  the  application  of  minor  setups  is  even  more.  Hence,  the  larger  the  demand,  the  more  beneficiary  it  is  to  apply  minor  setups  for  restoration.  What  is  noticeable  is  that  in  the  case  of  applying  minor  setups  for  restoration  the  number  of  shipments  and  minor  setups  are  increased  whereas  the  number  of  items  per  shipment  is  considered  relatively  in  the  same  range.  So  even  though  there  are  additional  costs  for  minor  setups  and  for  the  shipments  made,  yet  the  savings  are  considerable  larger.  It  should  be  noted  that,  for  the  last  run  where  the  demand  was  set  to  be  3000  units  per  year,  the  number  of  required 

63   

shipments  made  when  applying  minor  setups  for  restoration  is  100.  This  is  the  maximum  number  of  shipments permitted and is considered a programming limitation of the model.     4.2.2  Variation of Unit Production Cost  Again,  in  this  experiment,  the  values  used  are  the  exact  values  of  Case  C2i  and  C2ii  as  presented  earlier  in section 4.1.1, however, the unit price shall be altered to vary between 10 and 60 dollars per unit.

Again,  the  application  of  minor  setups  for  restoration  is  always  more  cost  saving  (yields  better  profits)  than  in  the  case  where  it  is  not  applied.  This  is  the  case  for  all  values  of  unit  price  of  each  item.  Furthermore,  as  the  unit  cost  per  item  is  increased,  the  benefit  from  the  application  of  minor  setups  for  restoration is more and more. It is noticed that in the case of no application of minor setups, as the unit  price  increases,  the  number  of  shipments  decreases  to  yield  optimum  results;  however,  in  the  case  of  the application of minor setups for restoration, the number of shipments increases (reminder: there is a  minor setup performed at each shipment).    4.2.3  Variation in Probability Factor for Imperfect Production    Again,  in  this  experiment,  the  values  used  are  the  exact  values  of  Case  C2i  and  C2ii  as  presented  earlier  in  section  4.1.1,  however,  the    parameter  used  in  the  approximation  of  the  number  of  defective  items  resulting  from  an  imperfect  production  process  shall  be  altered  to  vary  between  0.15  and  1.14.

Table 4.6  Results for production scenarios C2i and C2ii when the   parameter for the quality approximation is varied 

  As  with  the  previous  results,  the  application  of  minor  setups  for  restoration  always  yields  a  better  profit  (more cost efficient) than the case without minor setups. Moreover, as the parameter for the number of  defective  items  increases,  the  number  of  defective  items  increases  and  correspondingly  the  larger  the  benefit  from  the  application  of  minor  setups  for  restoration.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that,  as  the  parameter  for    reaches  increases,  the  difference  in  the  number  of  imperfect  items  from  the  two  different  scenarios  is  not  that  different.  In  fact,  they  approach  similar  values,  which  may  lead  to  the  consideration of limiting the model at a certain value for . Furthermore, in the case of no application of  minor setups, once   has a value of 0.94 and above, the system is actually operating and not yielding any  profit even at an optimum production scenario.

Conclusion 
    5.1  5.1.1  5.1.2  5.2      5.1    This  chapter  will  summarize  the  thesis  and  conclude  presenting  findings  and  further  recommendations  for future research.    5.1.1 Summary of the Thesis    The  thesis  has  covered  a  variety  of  topics  with  regards  to  supply  chain  coordination,  imperfect  production  processes,  and  consignment  stock  policy.  The  thesis  provided  a  brief  introduction  to  supply  chain  highlighting  key  definitions  and  concepts.  It  further  introduces  supply  chain  performance  metrics  and  provides  an  overview  on  supply  chain  coordination  discussing  the  bullwhip  effect,  supplychain  data and information, collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment. The topics of consignment  stock policy and the issue of imperfect  production were also discussed. Furthermore, a literature review  is  presented  thoroughly  illustrating  and  discussing  supply  chain  coordination,  the  issue  of  imperfect  production quality in supply chains and finally consignment stock coordination as a strategic policy.    The  thesis  then  defines  the  problem  and  provides  a  clear  conceptualization  of  the  scope  of  the  model  and the model rationale. The conceptual design is then translated into an actual mathematical model as  presented  by  the  thesis  through  a  detailed  stepbystep  construction  process.  The  construction  was  demonstrated  through  a  buildup  of  phases  clearly  presenting  the  reasons  behind  its  development.  Finally,  the  model  has  been  applied  and  tested  under  various  circumstances  that  resemble  realworld  Conclusion  Conclusion  Summary of the Thesis  Conclusions  Future Work

scenarios  and  under  various  changing  conditions  to  further  understand  the  behavior  of  the  model  to  develop insights. The results were discussed and presented.    5.1.2  Conclusions    A  mathematical  model  representing  realworld  scenarios  has  been  developed  that  further  expands  the  work  of  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003)  with  regards  to  the  consignment  stock  model  to  incorporate  imperfect  production  and  various  managerial  decisions  that  may  surface  as  a  result  of  the  imperfect  production.    In response to the objectives of the thesis, the following can be stated:   A  flexible  model  that  resembles  the  realworld  production  scenario  is  developed  that  applies  a  consignment stock policy. The model...:    ... incorporates imperfect production processes  ... allows for holding of imperfect items  ... allows for imperfect items to be scrapped  ... allows for imperfect items to be reworked  ... can apply minor setups for restoration 

The  model  can  be  applied  as  a  decision  tool  for  management  to  determine  production  policies  for different production scenarios based on data input from management  A  comparison  of  the  application  of  minor  setups  for  restoration  is  presented  with  regards  to  a  consignment stock policy 

  The  results  show  that  when  considering  imperfect  production,  the  proposed  model  of  Braglia  and  Zavanella  (2003)  is  not  applicable  and  needs  to  be  modified  as  has  been  achieved  in  this  thesis.  Numerous  production  scenarios  that  resemble  realworld  cases  were  considered,  and  in  all  considered  production  cases  the  application  of  minor  setups  for  restoration  has  shown  reduced  costs  (yielded  better  profits).  Scrapping  imperfect  items  either  at  no  cost,  or  a  cost,  or  sold  for  a  marginal  profit  is  considered minor relative to the benefits from rework or applying minor setups for restoration.        71   

5.2 Future Work    Although  seen  as  a  successful  exploration  of  the  consignment  stock  policy,  the  proposed  model  is  not  without some limitations. Such limitations may be programmable or conceptual and include:         For  further  investigations,  the  above  assumptions  can  be  relaxed.  Moreover,  there  are  a  number  of  different  lines  of  approach  subject  to  further  exploration  and  study.  Such  lines  of  approach  include,  but  are not limited to:   Programming   Providing a more formal software, readytouse and user friendly for management  Allow for faster calculations and processing time  The model is deterministic  The number of shipments per cycle may not exceed 100 shipments  Items reworked shall only be reworked once  The holding cost of imperfect items is considered equal to that of imperfect items  Minor setups for restoration are performed when a shipment is made 

Imperfect Production  Include more than one rework process  Consider the production process with a stochastic nature  Allow for minor setups for restoration in between delivery shipments 



Consignment Stock  Consider a stochastic market demand  Consider a threelevel or multilevel supply chain coordination network  Consider a multiproduct supply chain scenario  Consider the possibility of machine breakdowns for manufacturing  Relax the assumption that setups and minor setups are instantaneous
