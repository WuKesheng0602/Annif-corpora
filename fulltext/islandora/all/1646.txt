Abstract Zafaryab Naqvi

Identification of a novel gene altered in the rql mutant strain affecting - motor axon migration in Caenorhahditis elegans

Master of Science Molecular Science Ryerson University, Toronto, 2009

Novel genetic enhancer screens were conducted targeting mutants involved in the guidance of axons of the DA and DB classes of motor neurons in C. elegans. These mutations are expected in genes that function in parallel to the unc-6/Netrin pathway. The screen was conducted in an unc-5(e53) genetic background and enhancers of the axon guidance defects caused by the absence of UNC-5 were identified. Three mutants were previously identified in this screen called rq1, rq2 and rq3 and two additional mutants called H2-4 and M1-3, were isolated in this study. In order to identify the gene affected by the rq 1 mutation, wild-type copies of genes in the mapped rq 1 mutation region were injected into the mutants to rescue the phenotypic defects. There is a strong indication that the gene of interest is a novel gene called H04D03.1. Promising results indicate that the H04D03.1 protein also works in germ-line apoptosis.

1. Introduction
[n order to fully understand the tnechanics of nervous system development, scientists have 1nade use of several n1odel organjsms with fully functional nervous systems. An organism which has a nervous system that uses proteins hotnologous to that of the human brain is fundamental in divulging the intricacies of how neurons form networks that transmit and receive signals and respond to environmental stresses. Among these model organisms is a simple nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Work on this microscopic, non-parasitic nematode has revealed some of the major proteins involved in nervous system development. This current work was conducted to identify a novel protein that could be implicated in nervous system development.

1.1 Nervous system of C. elegans
Compared to other model organisms, C. elegans has a relatively simple nervous system containing only 302 neurons in the hermaphrodite (Brenner, 1974). Similar to what is seen in higher organisms, C. elegans has three types of neurons; sensory, motor, and interneurons (White, 1976). Most sensory neurons are concentrated in the head where they are divided into mechanosensory and chemosensory neurons also known as amphids. A large number of axons exit the pharyngeal ganglia and go along the ventral part of the worm forming a ventral nerve cord. Motor neurons have their cell bodies lined on the ventral nerve cord and send axons in the dorsal direction around the body of the worm between the basement and hypodermal me1nbranes. Upon reaching the dorsal side of the worm, these n1otor axons form a dorsal nerve cord by either going in an anterior or

posterior direction along the body wall, depending on the class of n1otor neuron (White, 1976). There are 5 classes of motor neurons which are A, B, C, AS, and D. This work will focus on classes A and B, more specificall y subclasses Dorsal A (DA) and Dorsal B (DB) (White, 1976). DA neurons cause backward moven1ents while DB neurons cause forward movement (White, 1976). Neurons belonging to both these classes are n1orphologically the same except for one anatomical difference. Subclass DA neurons, project axons in the anterior direction and their processes also go to the anterior upon reaching the dorsal cord before they synapse (Fig. 1.1.1 ). In subclass DB, axons are also proj ected in the anterior direction but upon reachin g the dorsal nerve cord, these processes migrate towards the posterior end where they synapse (Figure 1.1.1) (White, 1976).

dorsal B

Figure 1.1.1: Above image shows DA and DB motor axon migration in the body of nematode C. elegans. Cell bodies for both types of neurons are at the ventral nerve cord on the ventral surface of the worm where they send axons out towards the dorsal surface to synapse with n1uscles involved in forward and backward movement (White, 1976)

2

Another difference between the two subclasses concerns the source of their incoming signals. DA neurons receive signals through the gap junctions of a-inter-neurons and 8inter-neurons, whereas DB neurons get their stimuli through
~-

and y-inter-neurons. After

receiving these signals, motor neurons transn1it them through neuromnscular junctions which are located at the basement membrane of the animal (White, 1976). The neuro muscular synapses of the DA and DB are with the dorsal muscles through inter-neurons (White, 1976). If these DA/DB motor neurons fail to make it to their specific neuromuscular junctions, the animal understandably has difficulty with locomotion and becomes uncoordinated (Unc).

1.2 Molecular guidance cues for DA/DB motor axons:
Active axonal growth-cones are found at the tips of growing axons. They are guided by extracellular molecules present in the matrix between the hypodermis and the basal men1brane that contains the neuronal network (Hedgecock et al, 1990). These guidance cues are released by remote target cells and act as either attractants or repellents of the growth-cone (Dodd and Jessel, 1988). Guidance n1olecules can be identified genetically by treating the animals with 1nutagens and picking those mutants which display incorrect axonal trajectories of target neurons. Target neurons can be observed by the expression of appropriate proteins such as neuronal UNC-129/TGFP which is only expressed in DA and DB motor neurons. Once the mutant gene is identified, it theoretically should be implicated in playing a role in axon guidance and neural network fonnation (Hedgecock et al, 1990). Using this technique, three genes
~Nere

identified that

3

affect guidance of the DA and DB motor axons. These genes were unc-5, unc-6, and unc40 where ' Unc' indicates that these tnutations cause the anitnal to become uncoordinated.

Earlier, it was established through double mutant analysis that unc-6 depends on unc-5 and unc-..f.O for its function and unc-5 and most unc-40 functions depend on the presence and function of the UNC-6 protein (Hedgecock et al, 1990). In regards to axon migration, these genes regulate migration tnainly along the dorso-ventral axis of the animal. The DA and DB motor neurons fall into this category and hence their migration patterns are affected if any of the three genes are defective. UNC-6 is a laminin-like protein that is secreted by the neurons at the ventral midline of the anitnal (Ishii et al, 1992) and it acts as an attractant to UNC-40 (Chan et al, 1996) but a repellent for UNC-5 expressing growth-cones (Leung-Hagesteijn et al, 1992) (Figure 1.2.1). The function of UNC-6 seetns to be conserved in higher organisms such as humans where its homolog, which is called netrin, also acts as a guidance cue for certain neuronal network formation and cell signalling (Serafini et al, 1994). Both UNC-5 (UNC-5a to UNC-5d in vertebrates) and UNC-40 (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer or DCC in vertebrates, Frazzled in Drosophila) are receptors which are expressed on actively migrating growth-cones. These receptors help detect ligand molecules like UNC-6 and steer the growth-cone appropriately (Colavita, 1998). An additional guidance cue involved in dorsal migrations of cells and axons called UNC-129/TGF jJ was found by Colavita et al. , (1998). This cue is secreted from dorsal n1uscle and it is believed to attract axons towards the source of the cue. However, its exact function was unclear until recently.

Figure 1.2.1: Patterns of migration for growth-cones expressing UNC-5 and UNC-40
receptors in a gradient of UNC-6 ligand molecules. Growth-cones expressing UNC-40 alone are chemo-attracted towards the ventral source of UNC-6 while growth-cones expressing both UNC-40 and UNC-5 are chemo-repelled away from the ventral source of UNC-6 (Wadsworth, 2002).

More recently, studies have shed light on the long-range repulsion mechanics of the unc5/unc-6 pathway (Figure 1.2.2). As UNC-5 expressing axons move away from the source

ofUNC-6, they encounter less and less of the UNC-6ligand. Guiding these axons further towards the dorsal surface would require an additional cue or additional receptors that are sensitive to low concentrations of UNC-6. In the DA/DB motor neurons, both the UNC-5 and the UNC-40 receptors are expressed on the growth-cones which lead to the belief that UNC-5 overcomes the attraction of UNC-40 towards the source of UNC-6 (MacNeil et
5

al, 2009). However, in the absence of UNC-40, C. elegans 'animals display a slight defect

in the migratory patterns of the DA/DB axons (MacNeil et al, 2009). This supports the idea that UNC-40 also has a role to play in the migration of the DA/DB growth-cones away from the source of UNC-6. In D. melanogaster, UNC-40 receptors are needed for increasing the sensitivity of UNC-5 receptors to the lower concentrations of UNC-6 found at some distance from the source of UNC-6, hence aiding in long-range guidance of axons along the body (Keleman and Dickson, 2001 ).

Figure 1.2.2: Degree of defectiveness in axon migration patterns shown according to where the seam of the animal is located. Short-range migrations of the DA/DB motor neuron axons are defective when either the UNC-5 receptor or UNC-6 ligand molecules are non-functional while long-range migrations of the DA/DB axons are defective if the UNC-40 receptors or UNC-129/TGFP ligand are non-functional (MacNeil et al, 2009. и

Mutants of the unc-129 gene exhibit long-range defects in axon migration which suggested that UNC-129 plays a role in sensitizing UNC-5 receptors to low concentrations of UNC-6 (Colavita and Culotti, 1998). This idea was further supported

6

when unc-129 and unc-5 double mutants showed no greater enhancement of guidance defects compared to unc-5 only mutants (MacNeil, 2009). Moreover, unc-129 and unc-40 double mutants did not show enhanced axon guidance defects c01npared to unc-40 mutants alone (MacNeil, 2009). Both of these results suggest that unc-129 is useful in long-range motor neuron axon guidance and also that it works in the UNC-5 + UNC-40 pathway by increasing sensitivity of UNC-5 to UNC-6 ligands.

1.3 Model for UNC-6/Netrin guidance of active axonal migration
Since it has already been discussed that UNC-6 directs growth-cones expressing UNC-5 and UNC-40 receptors, how this is achieved at a molecular level should also be understood to further enhance the knowledge of nervous network development. UNC-5 is a non-tyrosine kinase receptor that is phosphorylated in vivo (Killeen et al, 2002). It is known that UNC-5 expressing growth-cones move away and UNC-40 expressing growth-cones move towards the source of UNC-6 (Round and Stein, 2007). However, in the case of DA/DB n1otor neurons, both UNC-5 and UNC-40 receptors are expressed on growth-cones. Studies have shown that UNC-5 has an UNC-40 binding site called the DCC Binding (DB) motif which binds UNC-40 receptors and is essential for UNC-5 mediated repulsion in the DA/DB neurons (Round and Stein, 2007). Therefore, it should be understood that the presence of UNC-5 is d01ninant over UNC-40 when it con1es to a decision on whether a growth-cone will move towards or awax from the source ofUNC-6 (Figure 1.3.1). It was shown recently that
UNC-129/TGF~

disrupts the formation of

UNC-5 homodimers and causes the forn1ation of UNC-5 + UNC-40 heterodimers (MacNeil et al, 2009).

Repu lsion

Figure 1.3.1: Signals induced at the growth-cone based on which combination of
receptors are present on the surface and are binding to the UN C-6/Netrin ligand molecules. DCCIUNC-40 has three highly conserved repeats in the cytoplasmic domain called the Pl, P2, and P3. Pl is essential for interaction with UNC-5 whereas P2 and P3 are useful in creating multimers with other DCCIUNC-40 receptor molecules. In UNC-5, the intracellular domain contains a zona ocdudens (ZU-5), a DCC binding site (DB), a repulsive motif, and a death domain (Round and Stein, 2007).

Other molecules are also implicated in working in concert with the UNC-6/netrin pathway and their receptors to trigger growth-cone response to UNC-6 signalling. These molecules are protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PKT2), Src-family Kinases (SFKs ), and Rho 8

GTPases (Lee et a/, 2005; Jin et a/, 2005). Inhibition of PKT2 and SFKs deactivates UNC-5 mediated repulsion of growth-cones in mice in vivo (Tong et a!, 2001; Lee et a/, 2005). Activation of PKT2 prompts fonnation of a complex where PKT2 acts as a scaffolding protein that includes SFK at the cytoplasmic domain of the active receptors. This triggers a cascade of events in the cytoplasmic n1atrix of the axon that ends in cytoskeletal retnodeling and also growth of the axon (Round and Stein, 2007).

1.4 Other guidance cues affecting dorso-ventral axon migrations
There is another pathway identified that works parallel to the netrins/UNC-6 pathway for dorso-ventral guidance in C. elegans. However, they are involved with guiding migrations in the ventral direction, while the UNC-5 and UNC-129 molecules described above control dorsal migrations. This pathway involves a ligand SL T -1 (slit in
D. melanvgaster) and its receptor SAX-3 (Robo in D. melanogaster) (Hao eta/, 2001).

These two proteins were discovered in D. melanogaster and were implicated in regulating axon migration through the commissural space of the fly brain (Hao et a/, 2001 ). In worms, SL T -1 is expressed in the dorsal n1uscles and regulates migration of growth-cones expressing SAX-3 receptors (Figure 1.4.1) (Hao et a/, 2001). This regulation is chemo-repulsive, as growth-cones expressing SAX-3 move towards the ventral side of the animal (Hao et a/, 2001 ). One example of such neurons are the Anterior Ventral Mechanosensory neurons (AVMs) which are neurons whose cell bodies are located close to the mid-body region that send axons ventrally under the influence of SL T -1 ligands (Figure 1.4.1 ). Once the ventral cord is reached, the axons migrate in the anterior direction towards the head of the animal. Chemo-repulsion between SAX-3 and

9

SLT -1 was proven when SLT -1 was expressed syn1metrically at the dorsal and the ventral side of the animal (Hao et al, 200 I). In this case up to 70o/o of A VM axons failed to tnigrate towards the ventral cord and only went in the ventral direction. According to site-directed mutagenesis studies, the second Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) motif in SL T1 is the essential component in ventral guidance of A VM axon (Hao et al, 200 I). Also, in the absence of the SLT -1 receptor, SAX-3 , the axons failed to 1nove in the ventral direction and only moved towards the head. The A VMs also failed to make ventral migrations in unc-6 or unc-40 mutants which suggest that both SL T-1/SAX-3 and UNC-6/UNC-40 pathways act parallel to each other and both are required for normal ventral migration of A VM axons (Hao et al, 200 I). However, Slit and UNC-6 have opposing effects, since UNC-6 attracts the axons working through UNC-40/DCC and Slit-1 repels the axons working through SAX3/Robo (reviewed by Killeen and Sybingco 2008). In order to further validate this result, double n1utants of slt-1 and unc-6 or unc-40 displayed 90% defects in guidance of the A VM axons in the ventral direction (Hao et al, 2001 ).

The movement of A VM axons towards the anterior rather than the ventral direction in
sax-3 mutants indicates that axons recognize cues that lead them in the anterior-posterior

(AP) direction indicating that SAX-3 is not responsible for AP guidance in the head region, i.e. short-range AP guidance. However, in earlier studies, it was found that SAX3 is required for long-range AP guidance (Zallen et a!, 1999) but this type of guidance is

not required for sensory neurons like A VM neurons that are extending into the head region.

1.5 Germ-line apoptosis in C. elegans
Due to the discovery that rql ;unc-5(e53) animals have a reduced brood size, apoptosis was investigated in the mutant strain. The analysis of germ-line apoptosis was an important component of the work described in this thesis and so an introduction to the topic is provided. The germ-line of C. elegans generates an undefined number of cells that proliferate until they become mature oocytes in the proximal end of the gonad. The gonad spans two thirds of the body of the worm and consists of two long tubes that start off at the ventral midline, go both in the anterior and the posterior directions away from the vulva, and then recoii back toward the dorsal midline tnaking a symmetrical U shaped structure which is joined at the uterus (Figure 1.5.1) (Gumienny eta/, 1999).

Figure 1.5.1: C. elegans gonad spans 2/3 of the worn1 body and encompasses the
developing sperm and cells that become oocytes. Apoptosis of nuclei occur in the ' Region of Death' which is also known as the 'pachytene region' (Gumienny et al, 1999)

The Distal Tip Cell (DTC) is a somatic cell at the leading edge of the migration gonad arm which releases a signal called LAG-2. This signal keeps the stem cells dividing mitotically in the region indicated by dark spots beside the DTC (Guminney et al, 1999). The grey region marks the meiotically dividing germ cells which later enter the transition 12

zone or the region of cell death, also called the pachytene region. In this last region, germ nuclei which are fated to die undergo apoptosis by condensing their DNA material and swell up which can be visualized by Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) (Figure 1.5.2) (Guminney et al, 1999).

Figure 1.5.2: (Left) DIC image showing an apoptotic germ cell (large arrow). Normal
nuclei are indicated by small arrows. (Right) Acridine Orange (AO) stains the apoptotic nucleus but not normal nuclei (epi-fluorescent image) shown on right (Gumienny et al, 1999).

Since the nuclei in the pachytene region are not surrounded by a cell membrane and share a common cytoplasm, it is hypothesized that the dying cells serve as nurse cells by providing essential nutrients like DNA material for the cells which are fated to live (Guminney et al, 1999). Moreover, when these dying
cell~

were analyzed using the

electron microscope, it was revealed that these cells isolated themselves from their neighbours by forming a plasma membrane around them that contained a small amount of cytoplasm. These cells are recognized and engulfed by gonadal sheath cells which form the lining of the gonad (Guminney et al, 1999).

13

Germ-line apoptosis starts when hermaphrodite anin1als are in the young-adult stage and oogenesis has started to take place. This idea was first hypothesized because there was no apoptosis that occurred in n1ales and young larvae of either sex (Guminney

eta!, 1999). To test this hypothesis, sdc-1 and tra-1 mutants, which have oogenesis arrest
and masculinization of the gonad producing only spenn, displayed no germ-line apoptosis. Therefore, it is assmned that physiological germ-line apoptosis is triggered only by the onset of oogenesis (Gummienny eta!, 1999). Exit from the pachytene zone requires the genn cells to activate the ras/MAPK signaling cascade that allows these cells to morph into oocytes and enter the fertilization zone (Gumienny et a!, 1999). Normally, the ras/MAPK pathway is required for cell survival as indicated by previous studies in human carcinoma cell lines (Johnson and Lapadat, 2002), however, in the germline of C. elegans, this pathway is directly or indirectly required for the initiation of apoptosis. In mutants where this ras/MAPK pathway is blocked, germ-line apoptosis is also blocked. However, if double mutants were made with an apoptotic suppressor gene ced-9, apoptosjs was initiated once again suggesting that ras/MAPK signaling could turn off ced-9 which triggers programmed cell death in the germline (Gumienny eta!, 1999).

1.6 Genetic pathways that trigger germline apoptosis
Altogether, there are more than 20 genes that have been identified as being responsible for germ-line apoptosis. Among these genes, 3 genes make up the 'core apoptotic n1achinery' that triggers apoptosis in both so1natic and genn-line cells. These genes are ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9 (ced is for Cell Death abnonnal). Out of these three

14

genes, ced-9 has a protective affect on the cell because it has been shown that ced-9 mutants have an increased number of cell corpses present in the gonad. Both ced-3 and ced-4 genes are required for germ-line and also for somatic apoptosis as very little or no programmed cell death was observed in either of the mutants. Therefore, the core pathway looks like the one shown in Figure 1.6.1.

their vertebrate homologues (Hengartner et al, 2006)

In mamn1als, Bcl-2 is homologous to CED-9 as it is an anti-apoptotic protein that contains four hotnologous Bel Homotnlogy (BH) domains. Apaf-1 (Apoptosis Protease Activating Factor - 1) is correctly identified as a hotnologue for CED-4 but CED-3

15

homologues remain very elusive as it matches a number of caspases in vertebrates (Hengartner et al, 2006). When the ras/MAPK pathway is inactive, there is no physiological apoptosis taking place in the gonad. This inactivation of the core apoptotic machinery takes place when tetrameric CED-4 is broken up into dimers that are bound to CED-9 proteins at the surface of the mitochondria. In order to cause death in cells, CED-9 is inactivated by proapoptotic stimuli which releases CED-4 dimers that later form CED-4 tetramers (Hengartner et al, 2006). CED-3 proteins are proteolytically cleaved to activate CED-4 tetramers from a precursor called proCED-3. After cleavage, CED-3 forms an oligomer with CED-4 that is known as the 'C. elegans apoptosome' which later activates downstream caspases and causes cell death (Figure 1.6.2) (Hengartner et al, 2006).

1.7 Genes involved in nervous system development induce apoptosis
As mentioned before, several apoptotic stin1uli and program cell death inactivating factors are present inside and around the germ-line that control when and where apoptosis should take place. It has been shown that an1ong these factors are genes that are known to play a role in nervous system developn1ent. The thre-e genes that wiU be discussed here are the unc-5!Unc5 , unc-6/Netrin, and unc-40/DCC whose role in nervous system development is well known and has been docun1ented but whose involvement in apoptosis is so1newhat controversial. Apoptotic roles of these genes have been analyzed in n1an1malian cell lines (Mazelin eta/, 2004) but never before in C. elegans. In humans, DCC is located on chromosome 18q on a region that spans a gigantic 1.2Mb region (Mehlen and Bredesen, 2004). The gene has more than 18 exons which produce several isoforms specific for different tissues including the nervous system (Figure 1.8.1 ). Even though there is alternative splicing, one common tnotif shared between all the isoforn1s is a single pass type I transmembrane sequence which is around 190 kDa (Mehlen and Bredesen, 2004).

1.8 Dependence receptor hypothesis
The role of netrin-1 (UNC-6 hom0logue) and of DCC (UNC-40 homologue) is well understood in the nervous system but their activity in other tissues, such as the heart and intestines, still needs to be thoroughly studied. My research shows a test of the dependence receptor hypothesis in the gonad of C. elegans where apoptosis has not been reported to be affected in the Netrin/UNC-6 pathway mutants.

In the mammalian sn1all-intestine, Netrin-1 is tnost abundantly present at the base of the tnucosal glands also known as crypts (Mehlen and Bredesen, 2004). Basal stem cells that express DCC on their membranes seem to differentiate in the crypt where Netrin signaling is abundant. As these cells move up the crypt, Netrin-1 concentration decreases and, it is hypothesized that, DCC triggers apoptosis when it cannot detect Netrin-1 ligands (Figure 1.8.2) (Mehlen and Bredesen, 2004). This conditional behavior of DCC would categorize it as a dependence receptor which is dependent on a ligand, in this case, Netrin-1 , for preventing apoptosis and upon disengaging from Netrin-1 , it triggers apoptosis.

Figure 1.8.2: Image indicating zones of proliferation and differentiation of basal stem
cells. Cell death occurs when these cells reach the tip of the crypt where netrin-1 concentration is very low (Mehlen and Bredesen, 2004).

To test the dependence receptor hypothesis, several experiments were conducted to investigate and validate netrin-1 and DCC interactions in the crypt (Mazelin et al, 2004). Firstly, transgenic mice (Tg-netrin-1) were created that over-expressed netrin-1. The mice grew and developed normally and when the crypts in the colon were examined for programmed cell death, it was noted that there was a 50% decrease in basal stem cell apoptosis. This was in-line with the dependence receptor hypothesis. Over-expression of netrin-1 was shown to result in an increase in colorectal tumors in Tg-netrin-1 mice and it was observed that 17% of the mice had at least one tumor in their intestine while the control displayed no tumor activity in the colon (Mazelin et al, 2004). The protein UNC5H was also included in this dependence receptor category but its effects are not as predominant as they are for the DCC receptor. Several other proteins, such as Neogenin and Sonic Hedgehog receptor 'Patched' are also included in 19

this class and this mechanistn is speculated to be in place so that cell proliferation does not take place beyond a space where a ligand is present (Mehlen and Bredesen, 2004).

1.9 Purpose of study
The primary focus of this study was to find novel genes that are involved in regulating axon migration of the axons of the DA/DB motor neurons. This idea was first developed when it was observed that upon silencing the UNC-6/UNC-5 pathway in either an unc-6 or an unc-5 null strain, the DA/DB motor axons migrated rlorsally about twothirds of the way towards the dorsal surface (Hedgecock et al, 1990). Since UNC-5 was the only receptor that was known to guide migrating growth-cones away from the source of UNC-6, this observation initiated the hypothesis that there must be other unknown proteins involved in axon migration. In an effort to identify genes in a pathway parallel to the unc-6/unc-5 pathway genetic enhancer screens were performed to identify mutants that enhance the defects of unc-5(e53) mutants. One of these mutants was the allele rql. The current study was n1ainly directed towards identification of the gene altered in the
rql allele.

The main reason for the analysis of apoptosis described in this study is that the rq 1 mutant, isolated as an enhancer of the axon outgro'W1h defects of unc-5(e53) was also found to have a very low brood size. One explanation for the low brood size would be increased levels of gonadal apoptosis. If apoptosis was altered in the germ-line it would support the hypothesis that genes that are involved in nervous system development could also be involved in regulating apoptosis as it was shown with Netrin-1 , DCC, and UNC5H in the dependence receptor hypothesis.

20

1.10 Genetic enhancer screen
A genetic enhancer screen was performed to observe if the defects that were already present in an unc-5(e53) mutant (considered to be a null n1utant) could be made more defective by randomly creating tnutations and screening for a specific defect, in this case axon outgrowth defects. The starting strain that was used in this screen was unc-5(e53) which is a null allele for unc-5 (Hedgecock et al, 1990; Killeen et al, 2002). An unc129: :gjp gene was integrated in this strain to serve as a tnarker for the DA/DB neurons as

UNC-129 is specifically expressed in these two neuronal classes (Colavita et al, 1998). Worn1s that had not started to lay eggs, L4 stage worms, were soaked in Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS) to ensure that mutations take place in the growing nuclei inside the gonad. EMS randomly makes Guanine to Adenine n1utations in C. elegans (Figure 1.1 0.1) (Hope, 1999). This procedure is also described in Materials and Methods.

Figure 1.10.1: Genetic enhancer screen in C. elegans. Screening for enhancement of
axon guidance defects was done in F2 progeny because mutations created by EMS were likely to be recessive and would only display a n1utant phenotype when present in a homozygous arrangement (Sybingco, MSc Thesis, 2008).

Once there were candidates from the screen, they were out -crossed with the starting strain for isolation of the target gene. Out-crossing with starting strain eliminates unlinked background mutations as the F2 progeny of the cross displays a mixed progeny due to recombination in meiosis 1 (Davis et a!, 2005). This mixed progeny
w~s

then screened

for worms that display the enhanced axon guidance defects seen in the original mutant. The out-crossing procedure is repeated several tin1es to ensure isolation of the target gene in order to eliminate any other unlinked mutations caused by the mutagen besides axon guidance defects. 22

Candidate genes were mapped on C. elegans genmne by a method called the snip-SNP tnethod (Davis et a/, 2005). SNPs are Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms that are present on the C. elegans genome and are specific to each strain in a species. Two strains in C.

elegans would have slightly different SNP locations compared to each other and this
became the underlying principle on which the snip-SNP n1apping protocol works (Davis
et a/, 2005). Mutant strains in this study originated from the N2 (Bristol) strain.

Therefore, the starting strain, unc-5(e53)[unc-129::gfp], and candidate mutants with enhanced axonal defects, all had SNPs typical of N2 (Davis et a/, 2005). For the procedure, 8 evenly distributed SNP sites were chosen for PCR amplification on each of the 6 chromosomes making a total of 18 fragments per genome. These PCR fragments when digested by the Dral restriction enzytne give bands characteristic of N2 but different frotn the related Hawaiian strain. Given that the SNPs are evenly distributed along chron1osomes, mutations in genes of interest would be closely linked to certain N2 SNPs on one chromosome but not to most others (Figure 1.1 0.2) (Davis eta/, 2005).

The n1utant strain was crossed with a Hawaiian (CB4856) strain with different SNP locations where this cross gives heterozygous F 1 progeny containing both N2 and Hawaiian chromosomes. In the F2 generation, a mixed population is generated which has worms that are homozygous for axon guidance mutations and display this phenotype. Any worms displaying this phenotype are picked and categorized as positive for the mutation and those that do not display the phenotype are negative for the mutation. All worms that are positive for the mutation would have a section of the N2 genome that would carry the mutant gene and the closely linked SNPs on it (Davis eta/, 2005). 24

Figure 1.10.3: An example of snip-SNP mapptng ustng dpy-5 gene. During
recombination between N2 (indicated by blue) and Hawaiian (indicated by red) strain, a mixed population is generated containing differing lengths of chromosomal segments of each strain. However, worms positive for the mutant phenotype will be homozygous for the N2 regions that will contain the mutant gene. N2 SNPs that reoccur frequently in positive worms will be the ones closely linked to the mutant gene, in this case D 1007 and B0205 (Davis et al, 2005). In the example shown there were 4 7 F2 animal pools tested and the numbers indicate the numbers that exhibited the linkage shown in the diagram.

Positive and negative pools of worms are then lysed to release DNA material that could be used in SNP directed PCR and the most reoccurring N2 SNPs could be identified for each positive worm. Theoretically a finding of 50% recombinants indicates no linkage between the gene and the SNP. The N2 SNP that reoccurs most of the time in mutant positive worms would be closely linked to the site of mutation and hence will have a decrease rate of recombination with the Hawaiian genome (Davis et al, 2005). Using this method, a mutation is narrowed down to a segment of the genome which could then be narrowed down further by subsequent snip-SNP mappings or microinjections of fosmids/cosmids containing wild-type DNA (Davis et al, 2005).

Microinjection of Fosmids/Cosmids

DNA transformation for C. elegans via microinjection tn the gonad was first optimized by Craig C. Mello where he injected extrachromosomal DNA into the transition zone of a developing gonad to generate transgenic progeny (Mello, 1991 ). For this procedure, he used a semi-dominant right roller allele of a gene called rol-6 which induces a helically twisted cuticle and body structure. As seen in Figure 1.11.1, the centre core of a gonad is filled with cytoplasmic material that works as a syncytium which provides nourishment for the developing nuclei surrounding it. This cytoplastnic material is enclosed by a cell membrane around nuclei as they approach the bend ofthe gonad (Gumminey eta!, 1999).

Nuclei

Figure 1.11.1: Cross-sectional view of C. elegans gonad. The inner core of a gonad is a

syncytium made up of cytoplasmic material which is shared by all developing nuclei that surround it. Sheath cells isolate the gonad from rest of the inner organs and are responsible for other functions such as replenishing the inner core, discarding waste material, and engulfing abnormal germ-line cells that fail to develop (Gumminey et a!, 1999).

26

Taking advantage of this structural setup and the large diameter of the inner gonad core, Craig Mello injected the pRF4 plasmid containing the rol-6 mutant gene into wild-type animals obtaining around 20-50 transgenic anin1als in the progeny of each injected animal (Mello, 1991). Foreign DNA would be incorporated into a developing germ cell when it is enclosed by a part of the cytoplasm from the inner core which contains the injected DNA. Considering that each wild-type animal lays on average 250 eggs, the transformation efficiency for this technique lies somewhere in the range of 8-20% (Mello, 1991 ). The number of transgenics obtained in the progeny depended on the concentration of plasmid DNA that was used in microinjections. A 20% transformation rate was achieved when
200~g/ml

of the plasmid was injected (Mello, 1991 ). As shown
50~g/ml

in Table 1.11.1 , transformation efficiency did not increase significantly after plasmid DNA.

1.12 Goal of current thesis work
The main focus of my thesis work was related to rq 1, a mutant in unc-5(e53)[unc129::gfp + dpy-20} strain, which was isolated as a genetic enhancer in the screen

described above. The mutation was n1apped down to the 2.126 to 3.923 region of chromosome III which contains 88 genes (Sybingco, M.Sc Thesis, 2008). In an attempt to further narrow down the mutant gene region, tnicroinjection of eight overlapping cosmids/fosmids containing wild-type copies of 88 genes were injected to identify the gene that would rescue the axon outgrowth defect phenotype in rql;unc-5(e53) (Bueno de Mesquita MSc Thesis, Ryerson 2008). This work identified a rescuing fosmid called H04D03 which contained the genomic version of 6 genes nan1ely M03Cll.8, H04D03.1, H04003.2, H04D03.3, H04D03.4, H04D03.5. The primary goal of this study was to
confirm that H04D03 was indeed the fosmid that rescued the defects of the mutant rql.

If this

was proven, the correct gene from the fosmid had to be identified. Furthermore,

mutant phenotypes besides axon guidance defects were also analyzed and are presented in this study.

29

2.0 Materials and Methods
The following materials and methods were used during the course of this project. References are provided for each method for tnore detailed explanation.

2.1 Strains used in study
The DA/DB tnotor neurons and their axons were visualized by use of a transgenic GFP under the control of the unc-129 (UNC for UNCoordinated) neuronal promoter (Colavita et a!. 1998). This strain contains the neurona11y expressed unc-129 promoter with dpy-20 and the integrated line is called [evls82B]. Strains used were unc-40(e1430) Linkage Group (LG) I, rq1: LG III, unc-5(e53) LG IV, unc-6(ev400), LG X, Strains made using this transgene were unc-5(e53)[unc-129::gfp}. unc-6(ev400)[unc-129::gfP],

unc-40(e1430)[unc-129::gfjJ}. These strains were obtained from Dr. Joseph Culloti's lab
at Mount Sinai Hospital. A screen for axon guidance mutants was conducted in an unc-5(e53) genetic background and several alleles were found and mapped on the genome (Sybingco, M.Sc. thesis, 2008). These mutants all enhance the axon guidance defects of unc-5(e53) considered to be a null mutant of unc-5 (Hedgecock et a!, 1990, Killeen et a!, 2002). Mutants from axon guidance screens are called by the allele name ' rq ' as this is the designation for the Killeen lab in the C. elegans cotnmunity; hence the first mutant was termed rq1. Strains constructed containing rq1 were rq1 *4[evls82B}, rq1 *3;unc-

5(e53);him-5[evls82B}, rq1 *6;unc-6(ev400)[evls82B], rq1 *6;unc-40(e1430)[evls82B}

2.2 Preparing seeded NGM plates
Regular Nematode Growing Media (NGM) plates seeded with the OP50 strain of
E. coli were used to maintain and cultivate wonns at 20░C as directed in Bretmer (1974).

NGM plates were made using 3g/L NaCl, 2.5g/L Bacto peptone, 17g/L agar in deionized water. The solution was stirred for 2 minutes with a tnagnetic stir bar and placed in an autoclave for 70 minutes at 122░C. After autoclaving, the solution was stirred until it reached 55░C. 1ml of 5mg/ml cholesterol (in ethanol), 1ml of 1M CaCh, 1ml of 1M MgCb, and 25ml of 1M K 2P04 were added in this order while the solution was stirred until it was cool to touch. After pouring media into plates, these were left at room temperature and the n1edium inside was allowed to solidify. Plates were seeded using 1ml 0/N culture of the OP50 strain of E. coli bacteria in LB diluted with Sn1l of M9 (22mM
KH 2 P04, 22mM Na 2 HP04, 85mM NaCI , 1mM MgS04) buffer (Hope eta/, 1999). Plates were

then incubated for 24hrs at room temperature and then placed in 4░C until use.

2.3 Quantification of axonal defects
Animals were placed on a 2% agarose pad on Fisher brand glass tnicroscope slides with a drop of 1mM levamisole to prevent worms from moving (Brenner, 1974). DA/DB motor neurons fluoresced under the epifluorescent microscope due to the unc-

129: :gfp transgene which is a gfp gene under the control of the unc-129 neuronal
promotor. Since UNC-129 is only expressed in DA/DB motor neurons, the transgene expressed GFP only in these neurons as well. Axons which failed to exit the ventral nerve cord of animals were counted as defective in outgrowth.

31

2.4 EMS mutagenesis
unc-5(e53)[unc-129::gjp +dpy-20] strain was deposited onto two large plates and
left to grow at 20░C until there were a substantial number of L4 or young adults on the plates (Sybingco, MSc Thesis, 2008). A 5n1l aliquot of M9 was pi petted onto the worms on each plate to have animals float in solution. Plates were swirled for 20 seconds to obtain a large number of worms. M9 solution containing worms was then aspirated off from both plates with a pipette and the volun1e of solution was notea. The solution was pipetted into an empty large plate which was then placed in a fume-hood. Around 50lOOJ.ll of EMS solution was transferred into the plate containing worms in M9. The solution was left standing covered with a lid for 4 hrs in the fume-hood. Solution was transferred to a 15mL Falcon tube and spun in a centrifuge at 5000g for 20 seconds. Supernatant was discarded and the worm pellet was resuspended in 5ml of fresh M9. The tube was spun again and the supernatant was discarded. The M9 washing was done twice more to 1nake sure that most of EMS was washed off the worms. After the last M9 wash, the worms were resuspended in 5mL M9 and transferred onto a medium seeded plate. The plate was left to dry for 60-90mins. Around I 0-15 L4 or young adult animals were picked off this medium plate and placed onto a fresh medium seeded plate for two days.
Next~

these animals were transferred onto another fresh medium seeded plate for two

more days. Around 20 non-Unc Fl animals were placed on individual small seeded plates and their progeny were screened for axons which fail to exit the ventral nerve cord. At this point the animals are in the F2 generation to allow mutations to homozygoze. Screens were done using a Leica dissection microscope, MZFLIII (Sybingco, MSc Thesis, 2008).

32

2.5 Apoptosis staining and counting
L4 animals were picked and placed to be staged on small plates to grow over a period of 24-48 hours. 150 J..!l of 0.05mg/ml acridine orange (AO) was transferred and spread onto small seeded NGM plates. These AO stained plates were kept in the dark for 24 hours. L4 stage or young adult worms were transferred onto stained plates for 1 hour after which they were transferred to a normal seeded plate for 2 hours to destain (Derry et a!, 2008). These worms were transferred onto a drop of levamisole on 2% agarose pad slide and the pachytene area in posterior gonads were examined on a Leica (model DM5000B) for fluorescent nuclei using a mercury vapour UV light source and GFP filter in a low light situation to prevent fading of the AO.

2.6 Immuno-fluorescence staining of C. elegans embryos
Young adult hermaphrodites were picked and transferred into a drop of 150 mM KCl on a glass slide which was pre-coated with 0.1% poly-lysine. An insulin needle was used to dissect the worms at the midsection to release mature eggs. A coverslip was placed on top of these eggs and the slide was place on dry ice to promote freezing. After 20mins, the coverslip was removed with a sharp metal blade before the ice inside could n1elt. This freeze fracture procedure allowed the chitin shell to break open. The slide was then fixed in MeOH at 4 ░C for 1Omins and then washed for 2 mins with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) solution. The slide was then washed for 10 tnins with PBS + 0.5% Tween20 (PBST) and then blocked by PBS + 10% goat serum + 1% BSA (PBGS) for 30 mins at room temperature. A 1:100 dilution of secondary antibody (Wheat germ agglutinin 33

fluorescein isothiocyanate or WGA-FITC) was applied to the sample for 2-4 hrs. No pritnary antibody was used because WGA-FITC binds directly to the a2-3 linked sailic acids in mammalian cells (Wendy Johnston eta/, 2006). Chitin staining was done with a chitin-binding probe (chitinase A 1 chitin-binding domain fused to maltose binding protein and labeled with TRITC (CBD-F)). This probe was diluted in PBGS at a ratio of 1:250 and then applied to sample overnight. DNA was stained with Hoechst (Molecular Probes) stain and then SlowFade (Molecular Probes) was added to the sample before the sample was exposed to UV light.

2. 7 Microinjection of cosmids/fosmids
Preparation of cosmid/fosmid DNA was done using a modified alkyline lysis method (Lin and Floros, 2000). DNA was electrophoresced on 0. 7o/o agarose and its concentration was estimated by comparison to the nearest band in DNA ladder. A mix of

myo-2: :yfp (yfp under control of myo-2 promoter) (Miller, 1986), which is the coinjectable 1narker, and the DNA of interest was made to a concentration of 50-100 J.!ghnl in water (3 :7 ratio of co-injectable marker: plasmid DNA) to obtain opti1nal numbers of transgenic progeny (Mello, 1991 ). For routine experin1ents where F 1 rescued animals were scored, 30 J..tglml of myo-2::yfjJ and 70 J.lglml of fosmid, cosmid or plasmid was used. For generation of stable lines, a concentration of 10 J..tg/ml of myo-2: :yfP + 90 J..tg/ml of plasmid was found to be preferable. A 0.2 f.ll aliquot of this mix was transferred into a 0.75 mm glass needle (Olytnpus Inc.) which was pulled using a P-97 - Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instrwnent Company). A needle was n1ounted onto a stylus and the tip was broken by touching it to the side of a coverslip.

34

Pressure of around 20 psi was applied to prevent clogging of the needle with glass fragments. The DNA mix was injected into young-adult n1utant hermaphrodites as shown in Figure 2.6.1. These animals were in oil and were tnounted upon a 1% agarose pad. After microinjection, hermaphrodites were placed onto a freshly seeded plate and were soaked in M9 solution. These animals were left to recover and were screened after 2-3 days for transgenic progeny (Bueno de-Mesquita, M.Sc. Thesis, 2008).

Figure 2.6.1: Micro injecting DNA mix into the distal end of young-adult hermaphrodite gonad (Mello, 1991 ).

my o-2p: :yfp (Miller, 1986) was used as a co-injection marker and it was injected along

with the DNA of interest into mutant anitnals. This construct contains the myo-2 promoter driving YFP, so it is a transcriptional fusion. Fl animals expressing yellow fluorescent (YFP) protein in the pharynx were picked as transgenics These transgenics contain extrachromosomal arrays and few are passed onto the F2 generation. There is a slight overlap in fluorescence between the GFP and the YFP proteins when seen under the Leica MZFLIII dissection microscope under the GFP filter (Excitation filter 425460nm, Barrier filter 480nm) but once the YFP filter (Excitation filter 51 0-520nm,

35

Barrier filter 540-560nm) is in place, background fluorescence decreases significantly leaving only the YFP in the pharynx visible (Figure 2.6.2).

B) Transgenic animals can be seen once YFP filter is in place. Worms with myo-2::yfp gene express YFP protein in pharyngeal muscles where myosin 2 heavy chain proteins are normally expressed (Miller, 1986).

3.0 Results
My research has focused on improving our understanding 'Jf nervous system development, in particular in understanding the guidance cues for tnigration of neuronal axons. Towards this end, we have made use of the model genetic organism, the microscopic nematode C. elegans, which has a simple nervous system consisting of only 302 neurons in the adult hemaphrodite. For the current study, we focused on the axon guidance of a particular class of motor neurons called the DA and the DB n1otor neurons. DA/DB motor neurons are pioneer neurons whose axon processes are guided by the UNC-6/netrin pathway proteins (Hedgecock, et a!, 1990). DA and DB motor neurons can be detected using the neuronal promoter of the unc-129 gene to drive the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Colavita et a!, 1998). The particular construct used contains an integrated copy of a wildtype copy of the dpy-20 gene along with unc-129::gfjJ and it is known as evis82B (Colavita et al. , 1998). UNC-6 is a graded ligand expressed at the ventral midline of the animal (Ishii

et a!, 1992, Wadsworth et a!, 1996) and UNC-5 is a receptor (Leung-Hagesteijn et a!,
1992) which together with the UNC-40/DCC receptor (Chan et al. , 1996) guides growthcones towards the dorsal surface, away from the source of UNC-6. Axons migrating in the dorsal direction are also guided by attraction to UNC-129/TGFp, expressed in dorsal muscle band (Colavita et a!, 1998). In unc-6(ev400) or unc-5(e53) mutants, the animals are very uncoordinated (Unc) since the migration of many motor neurons is altered (Hedgecock et a!, 1990). These two strains are putative nulls and the mutant genes in both have been sequenced (Wadsworth et

a!, 1996; Killeen et a!, 2002). In these genetic backgrounds the DA and DB motor neuron

37

axons leave the ventral cord as normal but migrate either 1/3 or 2/3 of the way towards the dorsal cord, never reaching their normal muscle targets (Hedgecock et al, 1990; Colavita et
a!, 1998) (Figure 3.0.l.B), whereas the axons 1nigrate all the way to the dorsal cord in wild-

type animals (3.0.l.A). In the absence of the UNC-5 receptor, the axons are still directed son1ewhat in the dorsal direction indicating that there are other proteins that guide these axons away from the ventral nerve-cord. Since these unknown proteins work in the absence of the UNC-5/UNC-6 pathway, it is assumed that they are working independently of this pathway. Screening for novel mutants that enhance the axon guidance defects of unc5(e53) was performed and three novel mutants were found in a genetic enhancer screen

done at Ryerson. The screen methodology is described in the introduction and previously by Sybingco (2008). The mutants found in the screen have defects in outgrowth of the axons form their cell bodies in the ventral cord. These outgrowth defects are observed in
unc-5(e53) and unc-6(ev400) animals, but the numbers are increased in the new mutants

found in the screen. Three mutants rq1, rq2, and rq3 were identified in the screen and were mapped by snip-SNP mapping on the genome (Sybingco, 2008). rq1 was mapped to LGIII,
rq2 to LG X and rq3 mapped to LG IV. An animal from the rq1 strain is shown in

Fig.3.0.1 C where n1any of the axons fail to exit the ventral cord. The current study focuses on the rq 1 mutant phenotype. rq 1 alone primarily causes axon outgrowth defects of particular axons and also causes mild axon guidance defects on its own in an otherwise wild-type background. The main purpose of the current study was the identification of the gene that is implicated in caasing these defects.

rql *3;unc-5(e53);him-5[unc-129::gfp + dyp-20}. Arrows in Figure c) indicate neuronal

bodies missing axons completely and some that migrate along the ventral cord.

3.1 Axon guidance and outgrowth defects displayed by rql mutants:
Worms that contain the rql mutation in unc-5(e53) have enhanced DA/DB motor axon guidance and axon outgrowth defects compared to unc-5(e53) (Figure 3.1.1). When quantifying the number of defective axons, we were not concerned with long-range or short-range migration defects in axon migrations from the ventral cord, but rather with axons that failed to exit the ventral nerve-cord and these are called axon outgrowth defects. They could be axons that fail to grow out of their respe.ctive cell bodies or those
39

which go along the ventral nerve-cord but never migrate in the dorsal direction (Figure 3.0.1C). The DA/DB axon outgrowth defects depend on the degree of penetrance of the

rq 1 mutation which was found to be different when considering each of the 14 neurons
(penetrance refers to the number of defective axons an1ong a population). Axons near the head of worms were not scored, due to difficulty in identifying them separately from each other. Quantification was easier starting from the DA4 tnotor neuron up to those at the tail and among these neurons, only the DB neurons in the middle were affected by rq 1 while the DA n1otor neuron axons were essentially unchanged from their appearance in an unc-5(e53) background. The three most affected DB neurons were DB4, DB5, and DB6 (Figure 3.1.1 ). The original screen was done in unc-5(e53), a putative null strain, so the outgrowth defects were quantified in this background (Figure 3 .1.1 ). An increase of 25-35o/o in axon outgrowth defects in the double mutant rql strains compared to the background strains suggests that rq 1 works independently of both unc-5 and unc-6. This result is satisfying as the screen was set up to find genes in a pathway parallel to the unc6/unc-5 genetic pathway.

Figure 3.1.1: Graph showing a comparison between the unc-5(e53) and unc-6(ev400) null mutants and doubles with rql. When an axon fails to exit the ventral cord it is recorded as a defect for that neuron. Each cell body is scored individually. Axon outgrowth defects for DB4, DB5 and DB6 in unc-5(e53)[unc-129::gfp] were scored and presented as stippled bars. The double mutant background of rql *3;unc-5(e53);him5[ unc-129: :gfp] is presented as small checked bars. The outgrowth defects were also

quantified in the absence of the ligand UNC-6/netrin that binds the UNC-5 receptor. The outgrowth defects are presented for unc-6(ev400)[unc-129::gfp] in diagonal striped bars and the data for the rql *6:unc-6(ev400)[unc-129::gfp] in vertical striped bars. Vertical error bars were calculated by using standard error of measurement in MicrosoftTM Excel« 2007 (Hatch, Lazaraton, and Dudek model) (n = 120).
41

The genetic screen for enhancers of the axon guidance defects of unc-5(e53) was continued and two additional mutants, H2-4 and Ml-3 , were found in this study (haploid genomes scored= 960). These mutants have not been extensively characterized. The data on their axon guidance defects is presented in Figure 3 .1.2. This brings the total number of mutants found in the screen to five, mapping to at least three independent loci. The location of the two new mutants on the genome of C. elegans is currently being analyzed by a summer research student (T. Lacraj , personal communication).

bars represent standard error of measurement calculated using MicrosoftTM Excel« 2007 (Hatch, Lazaraton, and Dudek model). (n=60). When the rq1 mutation was out-crossed into the wild-type strain, axon guidance defects were observed in around 40% of animals. These defects are mild axon guidance defects and are weaker than those seen in any of the unc-6, unc-5 or unc-40 mutants scored to date (Figure 3.1.3). Preliminary data indicates that the rq1;unc-40(1430) double mutant has the same type of axon guidance defects that are seen in unc-40 mutants suggesting that rq1 could be in the same pathway as unc-40. This result needs to be confirmed once the mutation in rq 1 has been found, since it is necessary to use the mutation to confirm that the strain contains the rq 1 mutation.

3.2 Microinjection of Fosmids/Cosmids
The rq 1 mutation was mapped to an interval on chromosonte III by snip-SNP 1napping (Sybingco, 2008). In order to identify the gene altered in the rq1 mutant strain, genomic fragments carried on fosmids and cosmids available from the Sanger Centre or from the Moerman laboratory in Vancouver were obtained (Bueno de Mesquita, 2008). The interval contains 88 genes and it was covered by eight overlapping constructs. The eight constructs were microinjected into rq1 *3;unc-5(e53);him-5[unc-129::gfP +dpy-20} to effect rescue of the enhancement of the axon guidance defects of unc-5 caused by rq 1. Microinjection experiments were conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital. Each time an injection was performed, myo-2: :yjjJ expression was used as a co-injection marker
(Okkema and Krause, 2005) allowing the selection of transgenic animals. This transgene

emits yellow fluorescence from the pharynx of transgenic animals. In the rq1 *J;unc5(e53),иhim-5 strain, the number of transgenic animals that were observed in the progeny

were low because of the low brood size in this strain. Among the 9 fosmids/cosmids that were injected, only one, fosmid, H04D03, showed rescue of axon outgrowth defect phenotype of the rq1 *3;unc-5(e53);him-5 strain. The initial experitnents were done by a 44

fonner graduate student and an undergraduate (Bueno de Mesquita, 2008; Kholkina, 2008). However, the number of rescued animals obtained was small, so more microinjections were performed to confirm that H04D03 is indeed the rescuing fosmid. The con1bined data is presented in Table 3.2.1

because microinjected DNA can be lost from cells unless the transgene is integrated in the genome (Mello, 1991 ). Note that K10G9 and F43D9 constructs were injected but no transgenic animals were obtained, possibly due to toxicity of the construct. *Bueno-de Mesquita, M.Sc Thesis, Ryerson 2008. Constructs contain wild-type copies of the genomic DNA from C. elegans and are arranged on the genome (chron1osome or linkage group (LG) III as shown in Figure 3.2.1.

Figure 3.2.1: Fosmids/cosmids shown here which contain wildtype copy of genes in the
genomic region where rq 1 was tnapped to. (Image obtained from wormbase.org)

There are 6 genes that have been shown to lie within the DNA carried on the H04D03 fosmid (WormBase), so the next step was to microinject the individual genes into the double mutant. The six genes on the genomic portion of the worm genome present in H04D03 are M03Cll.8, H04003.1 , H04D03.2, H04D03.3 , H04D03.4, and H04D03.5. Prin1ers were designed for each of the genes except for the last gene which was a predicted sno-RNA gene (Serdetchnaia, 2009). Each set of primers was designed so that at least 3 kb of sequence was present upstream of the gene and at least 1 kb of the 3' untranslated region was present along with the entire coding .region. Each PCR reaction was 1nade from the fosmid H04003 and was n1icroinjected into rql *3;unc-5(e53);him5[unc-l 29::gfjJ + dpy-20] to rescue the axon outgrowth defects. After microinjection

with PCR fragments containing one of the first three genes, it was established that H04D03.1 eliminates the enhancement of axon outgrowth defects in the double mutant strain rq 1 *3;unc-5 (e53); him-5 [unc-129: :gfjJ + dpy-20} (Table 3 .2.2). Axon outgrowth defects in double mutants of rql *3;unc-5(e53) ;him-5[unc-l 29::gfp + dpy-20} were scored as rescued when axons in three particular neurons were seen leaving the ventral nerve cord in a transgenic animal. These neurons were DB4, DB5 , and DB6, which were chosen as they were easily visible against the background gut fluorescence of the animal

46

and these are the axons that are most affected in the double mutant. The other two genes, H04D03.2 and H04D03.3, failed to elicit rescue, so they were eliminated as candidate genes. Therefore H04D03.1 is the best candidate for the gene altered in the rql mutant strain. This data implicates H04D03.1 as the rescuing gene in the rql *3;unc-5(e53);him5[unc-129::gfp + dpy-20} strain and the gene appears to have a role to play in DA/DB

tnotor axon outgrowth in C. elegans.
It has been found that rql has mild axon guidance defects in the DA and DB

motor neurons in an otherwise wild-type background (Figure 3.1.3). Scoring the number of rescued animals in the rq1*3;unc-5(e53);him-5[unc-129::gfP + dpy-20} genetic background was tedious as the number of progeny in the strain was greatly reduced relative to wild-type or unc-5 (e53) strains because this strain has a low brood size (~40 young animals per hermaphrodite). I therefore decided to microinject into the rql strain and score rescue of axon guidance defects. Therefore, recent experiments have focused on rescue of the rq 1 mutation in a the rq 1 strain with only the DA/DB neuronal marker
[unc-129::gfp] present. Using this strain, we were able to generate enough rescue data for

statistical analysis. It can be seen from Table 3.2.2 that a PCR fragment containing 3 kb upstream of H04D03.1, but not one containing I kb of upstream sequence, can rescue the mild axon guidance defects of rql in an otherwise wild-type hackground. More recently, the long PCR fragment of H04D03.1 was cloned by V. Serdetchnaia and it also rescues the axon guidance defects of rq 1 in an otherwise wild-type background. In addition, we found that 2 kb of upstream sequence of the H04D03.1 gene is insufficient for rescue. To date, we have shown that the fosmid H04D03, and the long PCR fragment of H04D03.1 can rescue enhancement of the axon outgrowth defects in rq1*3;unc-

47

the axon guidance defects of rq 1 in an otherwise wild-type background. In addition, we found that 2 kb of upstream sequence of the H04 D03 .1 gene is insufficient for rescue. To date, we have shown that the fosmid H04D03, and the long PCR fragment of H04D03.1 can rescue enhancement of the axon outgrowth defects in rq1*3;unc5(e53);him-5[unc-129::gfp + dpy-20}. In addition, the cloned version of the long PCR

product, when injected along with myo-2::yfP marker, can rescue the axon guidance defects of rql *4[unc-129::gfp + dpy-20} in the Fl , F2 and subsequent generations, so it is likely that H04D03.1 is the gene mutated in the rql strain (Table 3.2.2).

3.3 Embryo staining of rql mutants
A separate study from the rescue experiments described above was conducted to look at apoptosis in the germ-line of the rql mutant strains. ln the rql *3;unc-5(e53);him5[unc-J 29::gfP + dpy-20} strain, the brood size was considerably lower than normal (brood size of35▒15 young animals in rql*3;unc-5(e53),иhim-5[unc-129::gfP + dpy-20} double mutants as opposed to about 210▒50 in unc-5(e53) alone (Sybingco, M.Sc. Thesis, 2008). In order to investigate whether the embryos were normal, we stained the embryos of wild-type rql *4[ul29::gfp + dpy-20} with multiple antibodies and dyes that visually enhance specific parts of embryos. Wheat germ agglutinin staining of the cuticle did not indicate any defects in the integrity of embryo structure. When embryos were stained for chitin, there was a layer of chitin that could be seen enveloping the embryos. This layer is formed when an oocyte is fertilized. These results indicate that oocytes were being fertilized normally and cellular material was not being leaked out of the cell due to any irregularities in the cell membrane. However, when en1bryos were stained by Hoechst dye which binds to DNA, it was observed that chrotnosomal segregation was sometimes uneven such that one nucleus had a different an1ount of DNA than another. Also, the nuclear envelope did not form properly which suggested that this defect may be causing n1itotic arrest in embryos and killing them. A defect of this type could decrease the number of animals in the progeny of this strain. Since these defects are not known to occur in unc-5 mutants, it led us to the conclusion that the gene mutated in rq 1 could play a role in chromosomal segregation during n1itosis in early embryogenesis. However, this phenotype was rare (~6%) and was not sufficient to account entirely for the reduced brood size.

worms for 3 hours as described in Materials and Methods. Strains of rq 1 in wild-type and
rq I ;unc-5 (e53) were both tested in order to analyze the effects of rq 1 on germ-line

apoptosis. We saw a slight increase in apoptotic cell death in rq1 [unc-I29::gjp + dpy-20} n1utants which suggests that rq I itself might be a suppressor of apoptotic cell death (Figure 3.4.1 ). Surprisingly, in the rql,-unc-5(e53)[unc-1 29: :gfp +dpy-20} animals, we saw that germ-line apoptosis was higher than in wild-type or rq1 mutant animals. On the contrary, unc-5(e53) worms have a decrease in apoptosis relative to wild-type (Figure 3.4.1) UNC-5 has been previously described as a dependence receptor that triggers apoptosis in the developing gut (Mehlen and Bredesen, 2004). These results support the idea that both rq1 and unc-5 may work in two different pathways for germ-line apoptosis. Lack of UNC-5 reduces apoptosis, so some apoptosis 1nust depend on the presence of functional UNC-5 (dependence receptor). A mutation in rq 1 increases apoptosis, so H04D03.1 must normally decrease apoptosis. They therefore work to oppose each other. However, the fact that the level of apoptosis is increased in absence of UNC-5 and a mutation in H04D03.1, indicates that the mutation in rq 1 overides the lack of UNC-5. This is an interesting possibility and should be investigated further by following apoptotic corpses over time with DIC in the developing gonad. According to the dependence receptor hypothesis (Mazelin et a!, 2004), the absence of UNC-6/Netrin triggers cell death but its presence supports cell survival, as long as the ligand can bind to one of its receptors, either UNC-5 or UNC-40. In the C.
elegans germ-line the absence of UNC-6
incr~ases

apoptosis as expected if the

dependence receptor hypothesis is correct, while an absence in either of the 'triggers' (the receptors) decreases apoptotic cell death in the gonad (Figure 3.4.1). Furthermore, our

53

observations indicate that unc-40 has lower apoptosis In the germ-line than unc-5, suggesting that unc-40 plays a more important role in regulating germ-line apoptosis than

unc-5. This is a novel finding as this was not previously described in C. elegans and
further work on time courses should be done in the future.

4.0 Discussion
In this study, molecules that steer axons out of their cell bodies in the ventral cord were sought by looking for mutations that enhanced this defect of unc-5(e53) animals. Such mutants would be independent of the unc-5/unc-6 pathway because the screen was done in unc-5 null animals. The rq 1 strain satisfied all these criteria as the results indicate that the gene mutated in this strain has enhanced axon outgrowth defects in the DA and DB n1otor neuron axons in the absence of UNC-5 or UNC-6 and has mild axon guidance defects in an otherwise wild-type background. The gene likely to be mutated in the rq1 strain is H04D03.1 (Figure 4.0.1) since a) injection of the H04D03 fosmid rescued the axon outgrowth defects of the rq1;unc-

5(e53) mutant strain and several other cosmids failed to do this b) a 4.8 kb PCR fragment
containing the H04D03.1 gene along with 3 kb of 5' regulatory sequence and 1 kb of 3' untranslated sequence rescued the outgrowth defects, c) a cloned version of the same 4.8 kb PCR fragment rescued the axon guidance defects of the rq 1 mutants. Furthermore, I have shown that a PCR fragment containing either l kb or 2
k~

upstream of the

H04D03.1 gene does not rescue the axon guidance defects of rq1, suggesting that tnore than 2 kb and up to 3 kb of 5' regulatory sequence is required to effect rescue of the defects. According to homology searches, H04D03.1 is a novel protein with four other highly homologous proteins in C. elegans but weak similarity to proteins in other organisms. The other proteins are W03G9.3, (bit score of 313 and E value of 5e84 ,

LG I),

C3 8D4.1, (bit score 310, E value of 6e- 83 , LG III), W05F2.2, ( bit score of 298, E value of 2e- 79 , LG I), and Y37D8A.12, (bit score of 293, E value of 5e- 78 , LG III). The other four

56

proteins are also novel and also uncharacterized, so a new type of protein may have been uncovered by this study. According to the Transmembrane Helix prediction algorithm (TMHMM) found on WormBase, H04D03.1 is a transmembrane protein with an amino terminal region containing a potential transmembrane domain (an1ino acids 6-36), followed by a predicted region outside the membrane, and a second transmembrane domain (amino acids 108-129). Since the protein is predicted to be associated with the n1e1nbrane, it could mean that H04D03.1 is a receptor like UNC-5 and UNC-40 that mediates axon guidance through aid from extracellular graded ligand cues
li~e

UNC-6. However, from

the discussion below, it seems more likely to be some kind of novel ion channel. Proper biochemical analysis is needed to further elucidate the true role of H04D03.1 in DA/DB motor axon guidance.

4.1 Domain homology of H04D03.1 with non-C. elegans proteins:
Since H04D03.1 is a novel protein, its biochemical function in the nematode can only be speculated upon by looking at its conserved domains and interacting motifs. According to several homology searches, this protein has an integral membrane domain

58

near theN-terminus which probably functions as a signal peptide to direct the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Figure 4.1.1: Trans-membrane domain. H04D03.1 has weak homology to a trans-

membrane domain where the protein spans the membrane bilayer at least once which supports the idea that this protein could possibly be a receptor (NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD).

Another hit from the same NCBI CCD database indicated that H04D03.1 has an intracellular 'Diverse Signaling' motif which could be implicated in initiating a signaling cascade that would direct the growth-cone of an actively migrating axon. The protein that this part is homologous to is called 7TM-DISM, which is a trans-membrane molecule found in bacterial cells. This protein seems to respond to extracellular cues that belong to the carbohydrate family of molecules (Aravind et al, 2003).

Figure 4.1.2: Diverse intracellular signaling. The domain is similar to the signaling motif

of 7TM-DISM protein in bacteria, which is responsive to molecules that belong to the carbohydrate family (NCBI CDD).

H04D03.1 also has some homology with a Na+/H+ antiporter subunit (an E-value of 0.066) which suggests that this protein could be involved in maintaining pH inside the cell and also keep Na+ homeostasis in check. These two activities are closely related to neurons because after an action potential is completed in an axon, they are filled with positive ions such as Na+ and it is with the help of proteins like Na+/H+ antiporters that are able to regain their pre-action potential state (Padan and Schuldiner, 1993).

Antiporter systems do not necessarily play a role in axon guidance however, they are crucial for maintaining integrity of an axon. If H04D03.1 is an antiporter system, a mutation in this protein could degenerate neurons which rely on it for homeostasis. According to the data shown in Figure 3.1.1, we see that not all motor neurons axons are affected by rq 1 mutation which could imply that either the gene is under-expressed, the mutation is a hypomorph, or this protein is redundant in axon guidance pathway.

Red indicates homologous residues (Padan and Schuldiner, 1993).

In a similar context, NCBI closely related protein database indicated that H04D03.1 is most similar to a regulatory subunit of a mitochondrial ATPase known as IF 1 in the species Bos Taurus (Fig. 4.1.4). The protein is a subunit of the ATP sythase but only the
A TPase activity is inhibited by the minimal inhibitory region of the protein IF 1 (Raaig et

al, 1996) and not the ATP synthase. The minimal ATPase inhibitory region is found

within the region of homology shown below. This regulatory subunit is pH dependent, dimerizing at low pH and binding stably to the ATPase complex to inhibit it. At high pH,

61

IF 1 is an inactive tetramer, which activates the ATPase complex in mitochondria (Cabezon eta/, 2001). According to wormbase.org, C. elegans has its own version of the mitochondrial IF 1 called MAI-l and this protein is also pH dependent. H04D03.1 could play a similar role, perhaps as a molecule that inhibits ATPase activity of an unknown protein.

indicated by PRO SITE searches below. This region of H04D03.1 could be an inhibitor of A TPase activity of a yet unknown protein that could be involved in axon migration.

According to several PROSITE searches, the N-terminus of H04D03.1 contains 8 potential glycosylation sites (Table 4.1.1 ). Since glycosylation sites are normally found on the exposed surface of membrane proteins, it is possible that the N -terminus and all 8 glycosylation sites are located extracellularly or in the lumen of organelles.

Further homology hits indicate that this protein also has several potential Protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (Table 4.1.2). If these sites are exposed at' the surface of the protein at a specific point in time, it is possible that the protein has an active and an inactive form based upon its phosphorylation state.

4.2 H04D03.1 interacts with ZEN-4 and GEI-4
Yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screens indicate that H04D03.1 interacts with a well characterized C. elegans protein called ZEN-4/MKLPI (ZEN is for Zygotic ENclosure defective) and a recently discovered intermediate filatnent regulatory protein called GEI4 (GEl is for GEx Interacting) (Li et a/, 2004). These particular interactions could very well explain the embryonic lethality defects that were observed in rq 1 strains during antibody and Hoescht staining of rq 1 embryos. GEI-4 is a protein that is implicated in the cytoskeletal rearrangement during embryo development and is an essential regulatory unit of a larger complex containing two other proteins namely GEX-2 and GEX-3. The protein is not well characterized itself but it is known through antibody staining that it localizes at the site of GEX-2/GEX-3 proteins and also that when gei-4 expression was reduced usi11g RNAi, embryos became non-viable with visible tissue defects. This indicates that the protein is essential for embryo development and morphogenesis (Tsuboi et a/, personal cowmunication). Since embryonic defects were seen in rq1 strains, absence of H04003.1 could affect normal function of the GEI-4 protein. The ZEN-4 protein is involved in segregation of chromosomes during the metaphase period of cell division inside a C. elegans embryo (Raich et a/, 1998). Since chromosomal segregation greatly depends on formation of several microtubular elements (Sawai, 1992), ZEN-4 is believed to have a role to play in microtubule development and regression (Raich eta/, 1998). This protein has 28-31% homology to the CHOl/MKLPl class of motor proteins which accumulate at the mid-zone of the microtubulular spindle during metaphase and are crucial for ensuring proper microtubule attachment and

64

segregation of chromosomes during metaphase (Hirokawa, 1998). After the metaphase event however, proteins belonging to the CHOIIMKLP1 family do not have an essential part to play as it was observed that antibodies targeting these proteins, when injected in embryos after metaphase, did not hinder normal development of internal cell mass and daughter nuclei formation (Nislow eta!, 1990). Since ZEN-4 is homologous to members of the CHOIIMKLP1 family of proteins, it was initially assumed that ZEN-4 would be associated with mid-zone microtubule assembly (Raich et al, 1998). This idea was verified using antibodies against ZEN-4 during metaphase of cell division. In zen-4 null animals, the central spindle was not seen during metaphase but was observed in wild-type animals as shown in Figure 4.2.1 (Raich eta!, 1998).

Aside from helping central spindle formation and unlike the CH01/MKLP1 proteins, ZEN -4 is also required for cytokinesis where it helps in formation of the cleavage furrow (Raich et al, 1998). This characteristic was observed when zen-4 null mutants exhibited 65

defects in cytokinesis during experiments determining the spatial and temporal localization of ZEN-4 protein (Raich eta!, 1998). The observation was verified using two methods; first, to look at embryos of animals with no ZEN-4 expression in their germline and second, looking at embryos of animals which were injected with dsRNA to suppress zen-4 mRNA translation. In both types of animals, cells dividing inside an embryo were not able to undergo cytokinesis and were left .with multinucleated cell masses which lead to the conclusion that ZEN -4 is essential for both central spindle assembly as well as cytokinesis (Raich et a!, 1998).

Figure 4.2.2: Cytokinesis in C. elegans embryo. A) Cells in wild-type embryo (*)
undergoing mitotic cell division with two daughter nuclei (x) and cell membrane formation. B) RNAi for zen-4; no cell membrane is seen and three daughter nuclei are present in the cell mass. C) Embryo of a zen-4 null animal showing minimal cleavage furrow and no cell membrane to separate the multiple daughter nuclei (Raich et a!, 1998).

This defect is similar to what is seen in a few rq 1 embryos (less than 5%) which could suggest that H04D03.1 interaction with ZEN-4 is required for normal embryo development. However, absence of this defect in most rq 1 embryos could also suggest that either the H04D03.1 allele that is present in rq1 is a hypomorph or, ZEN-4 has other partners that could replace H04D03.1 during cell division.

4.3 unc-5 and unc-40 behave like dependent receptors for unc-6
As previously mentioned, tnammalian homologues of unc-5 and unc-40 seem to trigger apoptosis in basal sten1 cells of the gut in the absence of unc-6 signalling. This seems to be the case in C. elegans germ-line as well. According to the results that are presented in Figure 3.4.1, absence of unc-6 signalling increases germ-line apoptosis while absence of either unc-5 or unc-40 decreases the number of dead cells found inside the gonad. These genes are essential factors in axon guidance and do not trigger apoptosis in the nerve cells in the absence ofUNC-6. However, they seem to respond differently when working in the germ-line. In the case of both the mamtnalian and nematode models, it can be seen that these two receptors are dependent on UN C-6 signalling for inhibiting or triggering apoptosis. In the case of rql strains, the H04D03.1 gene seetns to works as an anti-apoptotic gene because in the absence of the putative protein, germ-line apoptosis increases. Even though the increase is small, around 1.0 ▒ 0.2 cells higher than WT[ul29::gfp], it is none the less significant (p<0.05). In rq 1 and unc-5 double m!.ltants however, germ-line apoptosis increases dramatically, around 1.6 ▒ 0.2 cells higher than WT[ul29::gfp], which suggests that H04D03.1 and UNC-5 are working in separate pathways even in germ-line apoptosis. Nothing more could be said about the role of H04D03.1 in apoptosis and its interactions with other receptor proteins until further biochemical analyses are performed. Rescue of this defect could not be performed because apoptosis analysis requires a large data set containing 60 animals and there has been no progress in producing this many transgenic anitnals using plasmid microinjections.

67

5.0 Future work
To confirm that H04D03.1 is involved in axon guidance of DA/DB motor neurons, additional evidence needs to be provided besides those reported in this study, which was injecting wild-type copies of genes to rescue the tnutant phenotype. Most importantly, a H04D03.1 gene knockout mutant has to be made to see if the DA/DB axon guidance defects are present in that null animal. Finding a mutation in the remaining sequence of the H04D03.1 gene would be good evidence that this is the gene mutated in the rq 1 strain. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of this gene should also give important clues about the potential roles of this protein in axon guidance. If it is expressed in the neurons it may function cell autonomously for axon guidance. If it is expressed instead outside the neurons it must play a cell non-autonomous role and may function to guide the axon around the body of the worm. Temporal expression patterns could be generated by placing a fluorescent protein gene under the control of the H04D03.1 promoter. As for localization of H04D03.1 protein, a tagged version of this protein should be made where either the tag is fluorescent and indicates the localization of the protein or, the tag is a binding site for antibodies which could carry a fluorescent tag with them. In the case of germ-line apoptosis and cell division, it will be necessary to see if the apoptotic defects in the rq 1 mutant are rescued by wild-type copies of the H04D03.1 gene. Biochemical analysis should to be done to see if the H04D03.1 protein elutes with known apoptotic triggers and proteins which are involved in cellular division in C. elegans embryo. Further analyses including time course analysis of apoptosis in animals subjected to mutagens need to be examined. Exposure to mutagens n1ay elevate levels of

68

apoptosis and could provide further support to the existing data since exposure to mutagens will increase the levels of apoptosis and may accentuate the effects of the n1utations on the appearance of the numbers of apoptotic corpses in the various mutant strains.

69

6.0 Conclusion
A starting hypothesis in this work was that the gene altered in the rq I mutant could be rescued by wild-type copies of DNA in the region of the genome where the mutation had been previously mapped by snip-SNP analysis (Sybingco 2008). It was known that the fosmid H04D03.1 rescued the mutant defects (Bueno cie Mesquita, 2008). In this study, rescue of the mutant motor axon outgrowth defects in rq I ;unc-5 (e53) and axon guidance defects of rql in an otherwise wild-type background by n1icroinjected genes from H04D03 were scored and they were both rescued by a single gene called H04D03.1. From our genetic enhancer screen for axon guidance defects of the DA/DB motor neurons in an unc-5(e53) mutant background, we suggest that H04D03.1 may be involved in axon migration of these neurons. The gene is likely to be acting in a pathway parallel to the unc-5/unc-6 pathway. This gene also seems to play a role in cell division during embryogenesis where it could be working with proteins such as ZEN-4 for aiding in microtubule formation, chromosomal segregation, and cytokinesis. Furthermore, H04D03.1 is also implicated as an anti-apoptotic gene as in its absence, a higher number of apoptotic events takes place in the germline. This suppotis the hypothesis that genes involved in nervous system formation could affect apoptosis. Once the nature of the mutation in the rq 1 strain is known, it will be easier to establish the importance of the protein in these activities. If the protein is under-expressed or the mutation suggests a hypomorph it is possible that a null mutation may be lethal since the gene may encode an essential protein. Knock-out strains have been requested from three groups with specialization in C. elegans knock-out tnethodology. Once these are available, the necessity for the H04D03.1 protein in axon guidance of other neurons and its

70

involvement in germ-line apoptosis can be investigated more fully . This current study provides tantalizing evidence for the existence of a novel protein pathway that may be involved in axon guidance of n1otor neurons.
