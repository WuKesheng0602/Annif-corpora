ABSTRACT

RIGID-PLASTIC IMPACT OF SINGLE ANGULAR PARTICLES
© Sandeep Dhar, 2004 Master o f Applied Science In the program of Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University,Toronto

The trajectory o f an angular particle as it cuts a ductile target is, in general, complicated because of its dependence not only on particle shape, but also on particle orientation at the initial instant of impact. This orientation dependence has also made experimental measurement o f impact parameters of single angular particles very difficult, resulting in a relatively small amount of available experimental data in the literature. The current work is focused on obtaining measurements o f particle kinematics for comparison to rigid plastic model developed by Papini and Spelt. Fundamental mechanisms o f material removal are identified, and measurements o f rebound parameters and corresponding crater dimensions of single hardened steel particles launched against flat aluminum alloy targets are presented. Also a 2-D finite element model is developed and a dynamic analysis is performed to predict the erosion mechanism. Overall, a good agreement was found among the experimental results, rigidplastic model predictions and finite element model predictions.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to take this opportunity to thank my supervisor. Dr. Marcello Papini for his support, trust, guidance, motivation, ideas and above all, generosity throughout the research. His qualities of intelligence, encouragement, friendliness and teamwork make him the ideal supervisor. `Certainly, it's not the ability of a person that makes people trust in him but it's the trust of people that makes a person able.' I consider myself extremely lucky to have such an able mentor. Thank you, Marcello!

Thanks are also due to all my friends and colleagues in the lab over the years. Everyone has helped me at one time or another. I would like to especially thank, in particular, David Ciampini for helping with the catapult design, and Tom Krajac and George Barbue for helping with the experiments.

I would also like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and Ryerson University for financial support.

Finally, I am grateful to my parents and sister for their motivation, support and encouragement during this work.

Introduction

1.1.

Motivation
Solid particle impact, erosion-corrosion, and liquid drop impact can all result in

target material loss due to erosion, but the mechanism of solid particle erosion is of particular interest due to its application in a wide variety of industrial processes. Erosion due to the impact of solid particles can either be constructive (material removal desirable) or destructive (material removal undesirable), and therefore, it can either be desirable to minimize or maximize erosion, depending on the application. Constructive applications include sand blasting, high-speed water-jet cutting, blast stripping of paint from aircraft and automobiles, blasting to remove the adhesive flash from bonded parts, erosive drilling of hard materials, and most recently, in the micro mechanical etching (abrasive jet micromachining) of Si and glass substrates for opto electronic applications, and the fabrication of components for MEMS and micro-fluidic applications. Solid particle erosion is destructive in industrial applications such as erosion of machine parts, surface degradation of steam turbine blades, erosion of pipelines carrying slurries, and particle erosion in fluidized bed combustion systems. For these reasons, the understanding of fundamental erosion mechanisms (i.e. the mechanisms by which the target material is removed) is of great interest.
The fundam ental understanding o f the m echanism o f m aterial rem oval due to the

impact of particles has received a considerable amount of attention since the advent of improved measuring techniques. In the case of erosion by solid particles, the trajectory of the particle while impacting the material surface has been of prime interest in predicting the material loss on ductile targets, since this determines the manner in which a crater is carved out.

Introduction

Erosion due to particle streams involves a large number of parameters that can be varied to affect the material removal for a specific target material. These include particle velocity, angle of impact (also known as angle of attack), particle concentration, shape, density, orientation (also known as rake angle) and size, along with target material properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, microstructure, hardness, and toughness). Various mechanisms including cutting, plowing, fragmentation, extrusion, elastic-plastic fracture and melting are also responsible for potential material loss. There have been analytical and semi-empirical erosion models proposed in the past (see Chapter 2, Literature Review, for a detailed treatment) that attempts to predict the amount of material removed, but these generally have restrictions in implementation. For ductile erosion mechanisms, Hutchings [1] proposed a rigid plastic theory which was later generalized by Papini and Spelt [2,3] for impact of particles of arbitrary shape against targets of arbitrary dynamic hardness and dynamic friction coefficient. Due to lack of available experimental data and the difficulties associated in performing angular particle experiments, the proposed model lacked, until the present work, detailed verification. This thesis is thus motivated by a need to generate experimental data with various diamond shaped angular particles to measure impacting particle kinematics and target material loss for comparison with a computer simulation program developed by Papini, based on the rigid-plastic theory of single particle impact, so that a detailed verification o f the generalized model proposed by Papini and Spelt can be made.

In ductile erosion, considerable plastic deform ation precedes or accom panies th e m aterial loss from the surface o f the target m aterial; w hereas in the brittle erosion case, little or no plastic flow occurs, b u t cracks form that eventually intersect to create erosion fragm ents.

The ductile m aterials show m axim um volum e rem oval for angles near 20° to 30°, in contrast to near 90° fo r brittle erosion. These em pirical m odel predictions w ere based on the assum ption that th e volum e o f m aterial actually rem oved is a result o f the cum ulative dam age o f non-interacting single particles.

Brittle Erosion Models
For system s undergoing brittle erosion, a num ber o f investigators [4,5] have

predicted erosion rates in term s o f both particle (e.g. size, density, velocity etc) and target (e.g. hardness, density, fracture toughness) properties. In a brittle m aterial, erosion rates are found to be highest for the particles im pacting at higher angles o f incidence (Fig. 2.1). Sheldon and Finnic [4] proposed a theory for brittle erosion, based on the assum ption o f H ertzian contact stresses that cause cracks to grow from pre-existing flaw s in the target m aterial during the im pact. The crack propagation that occurs from the load is related to the distribution o f surface flaw s through the W eibull distribution. The erosion o f the m aterial (expressed in term s o f gram s lost per gram o f im pacting particle) W , is a function o f th e particle size r, th e particle velocity Vj, and W eibull constants mo and o^:

Literature Review

2.3

Ductile Erosion
D uctile erosion is characterized by plastic deform ation o f the target m aterial

resulting in a considerable am ount o f material loss from its surface. H utchings and co w orkers [1, 9-11] reported that, in ductile erosion, the particle im pacts an initially stressfree surface, causing three typical m odes o f erosion: ploughing, and tw o types o f cutting (Type I and Type II). In type-I cutting, the particle tum bles forw ard after im pacting the target resulting in deep craters. In type-II cutting, the particle rotates backw ards, and the im pact ends in m achining or cutting the target m aterial, resulting in a long and shallow crater. The dom inant m ode o f erosion depends on particle shape, angle o f attack, and initial orientation angle; how ever, in erosion due to particle stream s, in general, each o f these modes is present, irrespective o f the angle o f incidence o f the particle stream . This is because there is generally a rotational com ponent o f the particles th at causes the effective orientation angle to be different for each im pacting particle in the stream . The experim ents by H utchings revealed that, a t shallow angles o f attack (glancing im pact), the cutting m echanism s are dom inant, characterized by long and shallow craters, w hich are cut out o f the target m aterial (i.e. actual target m aterial is rem oved by each im pact). As th e incidence angle is increased, a com bination o f both cutting and ploughing exists. In the ploughing m echanism , the eroded material is pushed to the edge o f the crater, resulting in th e form ation o f the lips or pileups (see Fig. 2.3). A t very high incidence angles, the resulting craters are deep, and large localized plastic stresses exist, causing the displaced indented m aterial to flow to the edge o f the crater in the form o f lips. Actual m aterial rem oval only occurs w hen the lips or pileups at the edge o f the craters are rem oved by subsequent impacts. Finnic [12, 13] considered the trajectory o f an im pacting particle, as it is resisted by a force, proportional to a constant flow stress m ultiplied by the contact area. The resulting crater w as predicted by assum ing th at no rotation o f the particle occurred throughout its trajectory w hile cutting the target m aterial. A sim ilar m echanism o f m etal rem oval w as also studied in detail by Hutchings et al. [10] for im pinging particles at various angles o f im pact, w here the rotation o f the particle w as taken in consideration

This assum ption has been central to all the model predictions w here the elastic properties o f the target are ignored in m odeling ductile erosion.

2.3.1.1 Model o f Finnic
F in n ic's analysis [12,13] o f the cutting action o f a single particle launched against a ductile target w as the first m odel o f solid particle erosion capable o f predicting m aterial rem oval rate. In th is m odel, erosion is considered to consist o f tw o sim ultaneous processes: cutting w ear and deform ation wear. The phenom enon o f cutting w ear predom inates at lo w angles o f im pact, whereas deform ation w ear predom inates at higher angles o f im pact fo r th e d u ctile metal.

W here V; is particle velocity, f(a), is function depending on a, the angle o f attack, m easured from the plane o f the target surface to the particle velocity vector, and Ph is the horizontal com ponent o f the flow pressure. In F innie's schem e, the particles w ere assumed to be non-deform ing and im pacting a target, w hich w as assum ed to reach a constant flow pressure (i.e. the target is assum ed perfectly plastic) im m ediately upon impact. The particle was assum ed to be under the action o f a resisting force vector o f constant direction. By assum ing th at no rotations o f the particle occur during the im pact process, Finnic w as able to solve fo r th e trajectory o f the particle in closed form as it cuts the surface, and thus predict the m aterial rem oval rate. Som e o f the predictions in F innie's model have been criticized by other investigators. The m odel predicts the volum e eroded by the particle at a<45°, b u t is incapable o f predicting the erosion observed for the higher values o f a. The theoretical treatm ent also tends to overestim ate erosion rates, and a factor was introduced to allow for the, as stated by H utchings [9], `considerable proportion, perhaps 90% o f the particles w hich do not cut in the idealized m anner visualized by Finnic.' H owever, this theory form ed the foundation for later rigid-plastic m odels. A model sim ilar to Finnic w as suggested by Sheldon and K anhare [19]. The m odel is based on energy balance betw een the kinetic energy o f the particle and the w ork expended during the indentation. The volum e o f m aterial, u , eroded, is given as a function o f th e im pacting particle velocity V, as w ell as particle diam eter D, (eq.2.5);

2.3.1.2 Model of Hutchings
W here m aterial rem oval due to im pact o f hard single spherical particles is concerned, a rigid-plastic theory originally developed by H utchings and co-w orkers [1 ,9 11] can be used to predict collision kinem atics and crater dim ensions for im pacts on ductile targets. The theory assum es that elastic effects can be neglected, and predicts the kinem atics o f the particle as it ploughs through the target, under the assum ption that the instantaneous resisting force can be calculated by m ultiplying a constant plastic flow pressure (also called the dynam ic hardness) b y the instantaneous contact area. Thus, the m odel is sim ilar to that o f Finnic, except th at the contact area is perm itted to change at any instant, depending on the instantaneous orientation o f the particle. This theory was later im proved by R ickerby and M acm illan [20], to include a m ore accurate calculation o f contact area, and to account for the effect o f pileup o f m aterial at the edge o f the crater on resisting force. The m odified m odel successfully predicted the energy absorbed during the im pact and the rebound velocity (except for normal incidence), b u t failed to show good consistency for the shallow angles o f attack. Recently, the range o f application o f the model w as extended by Papini and Spelt to predict erosion in coated targets, by accounting for the elastic spring-back o f the craters [16]. In m ost cases, com parisons o f the theory to experim ents yielded reasonable agreem ent. W here im pact involving single angular particles is concerned, th e rigid-plastic theory is less w ell-developed, and lacks rigorous experim ental verification. In m odeling the im pact o f square plates w ith ductile targets, Hutchings [9] rem oved the requirem ent in Finnie's m odel [13] th at particles n o t rotate during im pact, so th at the force resisting particle m otion could change direction and m agnitude, depending on th e instantaneous contact area. B ecause Finnie assum ed a constant force vector, this h ad the effect o f averaging all possible orientation or rake angles (see Fig. 2.4) o f the particles, and hence his m odel could not predict th e specific tum bling behaviour (i.e. forw ard or backw ard

23.1.3

Model of Sundararajan

Sundararajan [18] also used rigid plastic theory to m odel ductile erosion. S im ilar to Finnie [12,13] and H utchings [1, 9-11], Sundararajan m ade an attem pt to correlate the erosion resistance o f m etallic m aterials w ith their strength, ductility, toughness or param eters involving such properties in com binations. The m ain difference w as the m odeling o f the nature and size o f the plastic zone that exists beneath the eroded surface, and the possible interrelationship betw een the plastic zone and the erosion rate, w hich was not considered by both H utchings and Finnie. He explained that the plastic zone is the prim ary param eter w hich determ ines the m agnitude o f the energy dissipated through plastic deform ation during the erosion process. m odel are as follows: a) Erosion occurs by lip extrusion and subsequent fracture. A dditional m ajor assum ptions o f the

b) Lip form ation rather than fracture controls the erosion rate, and the localization o f plastic deform ation is responsible for lip formation. c) T he deform ation o f the eroding m aterial underneath the im pacting particle is adiabatic. A good sum m ary o f the assum ptions o f rigid plastic theory and the ranges o f applicability can be found in Ref. [22], w hich describes a m ethod for characterizing the dynam ic hardness o f a m aterial. Sundarajan and Shewm on [14] developed a m odel fo r th e oblique im pact o f a hard ball against ductile target m aterials. A ccording to the m odel (eq. 2.6), a frictional force, p, acting on the contact surfaces is assum ed to be constant and insensitive to strain, strain rate and temperature. The m odel also m akes the assum ption that the deform ation o f the target material due to normal and tangential forces can be treated as independent o f each other, and that the total deform ation is given by the superposition o f the two. The contact geom etries o f the particle at tw o different tim e intervals, used to predict the crater area and volum e, are illustrated in Fig. 2.5, Once the initial im pact velocity V , current angle o f im pact 9c, m ass o f the particle m, dynam ic hardness o f the target m aterial, Pd, and the friction coefficient, p, are specified, the num erical m odel (see Ref. [14]) can be used to predict the crater profile, crater volum e, rebound angle ,rebound velocity, and energy absorbed during the im pact. The best fit values w ere obtained for dynam ic hardness Pa and the friction coefficient, p from the predicted and experim ental results. U nfortunately, the rigid plastic m odel o f Sundararajan w as unable to correctly predict the energy absorbed per im pact, and the rebound angle o f the impact.

Plastic Deformation underneath the Impact Crater
A s explained in the previous section, Sundararajan and co-w orkers [14, 18, 22] developed m odel based on the assum ption that the plastic deform ation directly underneath the im pact site influenced the particle trajectory and crater form ation. Fig. 2.6 illustrates the deform ation o f a plastic region underneath the im pact crater by an eroding spherical particle o f finite m ass that leads to the form ation o f lips and craters. The im pact site contains tw o distinct regions o f plastic deformation.

20% ). A sim ilar deform ation region is obtained in case o f a sim ple quasi-static hardness test. In the region II, how ever, the deform ation is seen as nearly pure shear. The tangential force com ponent, pPaAc, is m ainly responsible for the near surface shear deform ation, w hich results in form ation o f lips. Since both the com ponent o f deform ation, PdAc, due to the norm al force, and the shear com ponent, p P j Ac, due to the tangential force, are function o f dynam ic hardness, Pd, the dim ension o f the crater form ed largely depends on this factor. The effect o f friction coefficient, p, w as thus assum ed to be insensitive when com pared to hardness. Sundararajan (and all other m odels based on rigid plastic theory) assum ed that the target m aterial to be perfectly plastic w ith no elastic spring back, but in reality the target m aterial is elastic plastic, and the particle is elastic. U nder such conditions, a velocity com ponent vector (the elastic rebound velocity), normal to the instantaneous contact surface, that influences the rebound angle o f the im pinging particle, is introduced. H ence, the discrepancy o f experim ental rebound angle w ith that predicted could be elim inated once the corrections in the elastic rebound factor were considered in the rigid plastic model. The localization model for solid particle erosion proposed by Sundararajan and Shewm on [14], takes into account the actual m ode o f m aterial rem oval. T he features o f high strain rate, adiabatic and constrained deform ation conditions not only cause the lip to form, but also effectively lim it the deform ation capability o f the m aterial [18, 22]. The nature o f subsurface deform ation underneath the im pacting particle is illustrated for three cases; (1) strain hardening, (2) perfectly plastic and (3) strain hardening-softening (see Fig. 2.7)

(i)

Condition of strain hardening:
W hen an im pacting particle strikes a target m aterial having a high and positive

strain hardening capacity (ôa/5E > 0) w ith a =flow stress, E = plastic true strain, the plastic deform ation beneath the particle spreads uniform ly over a large volum e (Fig. 2.7.a). No localization o f strain is observed and the form ation o f a lip o f m aterial is rare.

Literature Review
The condition w ith no ability to strain or work harden (5a/5E =0), i.e. perfectly plastic m aterial zone, is reported w ith the deform ation underneath the particle (Fig. 2.7,b). The im m ediate localization to the near-surface layers leads to lip form ation resulting in significant increase in the eroded volum e o f material.

(iii)

Condition of strain hardening-softening:
The behaviour o f strain hardening and softening are exhibited w ith strain

hardening at low strain and strain softening behaviour at higher strain. The reason for this unusual stress-strain behaviour is the tem perature rise in the deform ing m aterial, caused by plastic deform ation at the high strain rates. U nder such a condition, the m aterial deform s hom ogeneously up to a critical strain, 5a/5E =0. The plastic deform ation starts at da/8E <0 to form lips (Fig. 2.7.c).The critical strain thus represents the strain beyond w hich lip form ation, induced by localization o f plastic deform ation, occurs.

Type of Impacts influencing Material removal: (i) Normal Impact:
Sundararajan [18] considered that the critical strain is required fo r localization and lip form ation and not fracture. If the fracture o f the lip occurred readily, th en the strain induced could be equated to critical strain o f the eroding m aterial. For norm al im pacts, the average strain induced per im pact is usually very small, in the range o f a few per cent o f th e critical strain. H ence a num ber o f impacts are required at a given location before the critical strain is reached resulting in lip form ation and its subsequent fracture.

(ii) Oblique impact
D uring oblique im pact, a significant am ount o f plastic deform ation occurs in the near-surface shear layer due to the tangential frictional force w hich exists at the contact surface betw een the particle and the eroding material. V ery high shear strains are accum ulated in this region, resulting in the form ation o f lips on the exit side o f th e crater.

Literature Review
The m ajor difference betw een erosion at norm al im pact and oblique im pact is the attainm ent o f this critical strain for the fracture o f the m aterial to occur. In the case o f angular particles im pacting at oblique angles, th e frictional force betw een the particle and the eroding m aterial induces very high levels o f shear strain in the near-surface regions o f the eroding material. The shear strains induced are usually h ig h in m agnitude and exceed the critical strain even during the first im pact, leading to lip form ation. Thus, the form ation o f lips occurs during each im pact in the case o f oblique im pact. Further, the lip detachm ent from the crater edge is also easier in the case o f oblique im pact since the protruding lip is im pacted from side in the subsequent impact. In case o f spherical particles, the extent o f shear deform ation is very h ig h at very oblique im pact angles (e.g. less than 30°).

(iii) Combined impact:
The com bined im pact situation is the sum m ation for both th e norm al and the oblique im pacts. The im pact angles w hich are very near to the transition range show both kind o f behaviour, and hence the crater form ed can be analyzed b y sum m ing the characteristic o f both the norm al and oblique impact.

2.3.1.4 Model of Papini and Spelt
A rigid plastic theory developed by Papini and Spelt [2, 3] generalized H utchings' [1,9] rigid-plastic theory for square particles, so that arbitrarily shaped particles im pacting against targets o f arbitrary dynam ic hardness and dynam ic friction coefficient, could be treated. The specific case o f tw o-dim ensional `diam ond shaped' particles o f

and the orientation o f the particle, 0, at any tim e during the impact. W hile the particle is in full contact w ith the target (i.e. bo th the left and right sides contact over contiguous areas), the equations can be solved in closed form . H owever, in m ost cases, at som e point during the im pact, portions o f the particle lose contact w ith the surface as the particle rotates and form s the crater. The particle can m ake sim ultaneous contact over more th an one contiguous area, so that the instantaneous contact area described by the integrals in eqs.

Literature Review
Fig. 2.10 shows the ductile m aterial rem oved by the particle at various angles o f attack [25]. The curve (1) represents th e erosion at very shallow angles w here the target m aterial is com pletely rem oved from the surface o f the target m aterial. A t angles im pacting near the curve (2) range, the particle ploughs the m aterial to the crater edge, w hich is rem oved by a subsequent incom ing particle. The indentation feature is predom inant at norm al angles o f im pact, i.e. the curve (3) range. It w as thus concluded that angle o f im pact has a significant effect on the m echanism o f erosion and m aterial removal, irrespective o f the nature o f target material. M ost investigators dem onstrated sim ilar erosion curves for ductile m aterials and observed that peak erosion loss occurs at around 20° and 90° (norm al incidence) for brittle materials. Sundararajan [18] illustrated relative erosion rates o f N ickel alloys at various im pact angles and im pact velocities w ith the use o f SiC erodent particles, and obtained higher erosion rates for shallow im pact angles, com pared to norm al or near norm al angles o f incidence.

2.4.3 Orientation angle/rake angle
This param eter is studied only in ductile cases, w here erosion due to angular particles is involved. H utchings [9] w as one o f the first investigators to study th e effect o f variation o f rake angle on the volum e o f m aterial rem oved, involving square particles. Papini and Spelt [2,3] studied the effect o f orientation angle in detail, and concluded that, for a given angle o f attack, the crater volum e increases w ith an increase in orientation angle, until a transition angle is reached, w herein the crater volum e is highest. A t this transition angle, the rotation o f the rebounding particle changes from forw ards to backwards. T he crater volum e drops drastically above this transitional orientation angle.

2.4.4 Material properties
Target Material Hardness
M aterial hardness is the m ost im portant property influencing the nature o f ductile erosion. H utchings and co-w orkers (1, 9-11) characterized the influence o f dynam ic hardness on erosion due to im pact o f angular square particles. Sundararajan and co

workers [14,15,18,22] noticed that the dynam ic hardness greatly influenced the form ation o f localized plastic zones in the eroding m aterial underneath the particle that affected the form ation o f lips, and subsequent material rem oval from the surface. As expected, both investigators reported a higher resistance to erosion for harder m aterials.

Strain rate sensitivity
In studying th e erosion o f ductile materials by im pacting square angular plates, very high strain rates in the range o f 10^/s to 10^/s w ere reported by H utchings [9]. Sundararajan [14,18] also reported high strains at oblique im pacts. Sim ilar observations w ere also reported by A quaro and Fontani [7] for spherical particles, w here strains often reached the critical level in oblique im pacts as com pared to norm al im pacts and therefore, m ore than one im pact w as often required to rem ove target m aterial in cases o f norm al impacts.

Literature Review

Erodent hardness
Theories related to ductile erosion have specified that little effect o f hardness on erosion rate should be expected, as long as the im pacting particle hardness is greater than the target hardness. Finnie [12,13] noticed that the heat treatm ent o f steel had no effect on their erosion resistance as hardness o f eroding particles such as SiC and AI 2O 3 w as m uch greater than the ductile target material. The rigid plastic m odels o f H utchings [1, 9-11], Papini and Spelt [2,3], and Sundararajan [14, 18] have considered particles to be rigid and thus th at a change in the erodent hardness has the least influence on th e m agnitude o f erosive w ear.

2.4.5 Erodent Shape
The nature o f the crater profile and the rate o f erosion also greatly depend on the shape o f the erodent. W hen ductile erosion dom inates, it has been dem onstrated that the rate o f erosion is higher for angular particles than spherical particles, the m ass o f the particles and all other param eters being equal. Erosion by spherical particles develops `hill and v alley ' crater profiles. For im pacts w ith square angular plates, H utchings [9] found deep craters cut by forw ard rotating particles w ith m aterials pileup at the crater edge, and long and shallow craters cut by backw ard rotating particles. The degree o f angularity o f the particles is also im portant in determ ining the effective m aterial rem oval rate. Papini and Spelt [2,3], conducted param etric studies o f various sym m etric angular particles and found that erosion was highest in case o f 80° particles, all other conditions being equal.

2.4.6 Erodent Size
K osel [26] found that for the ductile m aterials, the size o f erodent particles has a very low effect on the erosion rate for the particles sizes above 100 pm , b u t th e erosion rate decreases rapidly w ith particle sizes below 100 pm. F or sizes greater th an this critical value, the relative erosion is essentially independent o f the particle size. It has also been suggested [26] that for ductile erosion to be effective there exists a threshold size (=5 pm ) o f the particle, below w hich no erosion is possible.

Experim ental Apparatus and Procedure

This chapter describes the experim ental set up used to launch single angular particles against ductile target m aterials, and to m easure the rebound kinem atics. N ote that portions o f this chapter will soon been published in a refereed jo u rn al paper [27].

3.1

Background
A num ber o f authors have perform ed experim ents involving the im pact o f single

spherical particles. For exam ple, Tirupataiah et al. [15] constructed a gravity drop system to m easure th e norm al im pacts by hard balls, im pacting the sam ples w ith velocities o f 10 m/s. The system released one ball at a tim e, dropping freely under the influence o f the gravity on th e target m aterial fixed rigidly to the target holder. To m easure the velocity o f the incident and the rebound ball, tw o photodiode em itters and sensors separated by know n distance w ere used. In a sim ilar experim ent for the oblique im pact o f hard balls against a ductile m aterial, Sundararajan and Shew m on [14] used a single stage helium gas gun to accelerate steel balls through a one m eter long barrel. A target holder held the eroding m aterial at any desired angle. The velocities were m easured using a photodiode tim er system, and the angle o f the rebounding ball was m easured using an alum inum foil system. The foil system consisted o f tw o separate units separated by a fixed distance, w ith each u nit containing two alum inium foils separated by an insulating paper. The tim er was activated as the ball pierced the first unit and stopped w hen the ball pierced th e second unit. The elapsed tim e w as then used to calculate the rebound velocity and the holes left by the ball back tracked the path o f the rebounding ball, thus allow ing for estim ation o f the rebound angles.

Experimental Apparatus and Procedure
Im pact experim ents o f single glass spheres on coated surfaces w ere perform ed by Papini and Spelt [12], w ho used a gas gun to launch the particles, and flash photography to m easure the particle kinem atics. In their setup, a single glass sphere w as loaded into a cylindrical urethane sabot, which, in turn, w as loaded into a long steel barrel. A solenoid valve, serving as a trigger was attached to the barrel via a breech, and w as connected to a com pressed air cylinder. The air accelerated the sabot and the glass sphere to the end o f the barrel w here a ring stopped the sabot and allow ed the sphere to exit, and im pact the target m a teria l The acceleration w as regulated by the air pressure. CCD cam eras, in conjunction w ith high speed flashes, and an infrared sensitive trigger w ere used to take im ages o f the incident and the rebounding sphere at the instant o f im pact. This allow ed both the incident and rebound velocities and angles to be determined. U ntil the present work, the only existing m easurem ent o f single angular particles w as perform ed by Hutchings [9]. The reason for such a lim ited experim ental database is th a t obtaining repeatable data w ith angular particles is extrem ely challenging. H utchings accelerated square plates to velocities o f 200 m /s using a com pressed gas gun w ith a barrel o f rectangular cross section. Each o f the plates was h eld in a paxolin sabot, w hich w as a sliding fit in the gim barrel. A t the m uzzle o f the gun, the sabot w as arrested and the plates w ere allow ed to fly freely to im pact the target m aterial. The velocity o f the plates was determ ined by interruption o f two light beams, and a h ig h speed cam era recorded the im pact. The orientation angle, i.e. the rake angle as defined by H utchings [9], (see section 2.3.1.2), o f the angular particle im pacting the target m aterial could be varied by adjusting the orientation o f the slot in the sabot. The plates, how ever, w ere very large com pared to those used in the present study, and only square particles could be launched in the rectangular bore gun.

3.3

Design Requirements of the Apparatus
Im pact experim ents involving angular particles are extrem ely difficult to perform

in a repeatable fashion. I f particles o f uniform thickness are launched, then the im pact m ust occur in a single plane, perpendicular to the target surface. This m eans that the particle m ust be launched in a m anner such that it arrives at the target w ith its velocity vector in the plane o f the particle itself. I f not, the particle w ill rebound out-of-plane, and m easurem ent o f rebound param eters using a high speed cam era (w hich is placed w ith its lens in the sam e plane as the launched particle) will be im possible. The present author initially attem pted to launch via a gas gun/sabot setup similar to that o f H utchings [9] and Papini and Spelt [2,3], but found problem s w ith particles arriving at th e surface in a nonplanar orientation due to excess deform ation o f the carrying sabot upon hitting the stopping ring. In order to overcom e these problem s, and to address the criteria described above, a catapult apparatus w as designed and built such that it be capable o f launching single angular particles o f the type show n in Fig. 3.1 while ensuring: a) Only 2-dim ensional surface contact in Y-Z plane, (see Fig. 2.7 in Section 2.3.1.4) occurred b) The apparatus be capable o f m easuring the particle kinem atics (i.e. the incident and rebound linear and angular velocities) for determ ining the energy loss during the collision c) The apparatus be adjustable so that the angle o f attack, initial particle orientation, and velocity could be varied, and particle o f various angularities could be accom m odated.

Catapult/FlashCam Setup
The catapult apparatus show n in Fig. 3.2 was found to be the b est solution. The

catapult was loaded m anually by pressing the launching end o f the lever arm dow n until it was locked to the release m echanism . The locking key o f the release m echanism locked the lever arm in place w hile the two springs (19 m m tem pered steel c o f spring.

Experimental Apparatus and Procedure
particle velocities in the range 25-30 m/s w ere obtained. To obtain pictures o f the incident and rebound linear and angular velocities, and the trajectory o f the angular particle in the perpendicular plane, a FlasbC am high-speed digital cam era (Cooke Corp., A uburn H ills, MI, U SA ) was used. The setup is detailed in Fig. 3.4. The FlashC am is a digital cam era w ith a high speed electronic shutter capable o f taking 10 exposures in a standard video frame w ith a m inim um separation betw een each exposure and exposure tim e o f 1 ps.

Analysis of Images to Determine Particle Kinematics
The im ages o f the collision trajectories o f type show n in Fig. 3.3 w ere analysed

using im age analysis software (Scion Im age Beta, Scion Corporation, M aryland) to m easure the angle o f attack and the angle o f rebound, the particle orientation angle at the instant o f im pact, and the linear and angular velocities o f the incident and the rebounding particle. The incident and rebound linear velocities were obtained by m easuring the

distance betw een tw o successive exposure im ages, divided by the delay betw een exposures. D ue to blurring o f the im ages, the follow ing uncertainties w ere encountered: on the order o f ± 0.2 m m for the linear m easurem ent, and ±0.8° for the angular m easurem ent. These uncertainties resulted in a m axim um error o f 1 m /s in m easurem ent o f linear velocity, and 40 rad/s in m easurem ent o f angular velocity.

Measurement of crater dimensions
R eplica casting was used to m easure the volum e o f the crater form ed by the

impacting particle. Reprorubber (Flexbar M achine Corporation, Islandia, N Y ), w hich was used in this replication technique, is a m etrology-grade rubber that provides virtually a perfect replica casting o f internal and external forms. The castings are green in color and have excellent dim ensional and deform ation stability up to a tem perature o f 60°C. A m ix o f R eprorubber that is self curing in m inutes was poured on the target surface, com pletely filling the bare craters. After 15 to 20 m inutes, the self cured rubber w as then carefully peeled o ff from the target surface w ith the help o f forceps. A protruding surface profile, w hich is an exact reverse replica o f the actual crater, appears on the surface o f the R eprorubber facing the target surface. A cross section o f the crater replica was then cut out by a razor blade and placed on a w hite paper w ith a calibrated scale and exam ined under a m icroscope. A 5-m ega pixel digital cam era (Canon Inc, Tokyo, Japan), attached to the eye piece o f the m icroscope w as used to take the image o f the crater replica, w hich was later analyzed using im age analysis softw are to exam ine the nature o f crater profile and m easure its volum e.

W hen the particle rotated backw ards, in m ost cases, a pure cutting or m achining action was observed, resulting in removal o f a chip o f m aterial. This typical behaviour was also observed by Hutchings for experim ents involving the im pact o f square particles [9]. These two m echanism s are considered in m ore detail below.

W hen the particles are launched in stream s, material rem oval is thought to occur this by subsequent im pacts o f particles on this lip o f piled up material. Previous studies involving im pact of square plates [9] have also reported this behaviour. For forw ard rotating particles w ith steeper angles o f attack, and especially w hen the initial orientation angle 8, (Fig. 4.1) was negative, an initial forw ard im pact was often followed by m ultiple forw ard secondary im pacts, as the particle skipped across the surface.

In the case o f backw ards rotating particles, alm ost all o f the experim ents involved multiple im pacts, the first, a pure m achining action by the leading 60° vertex as the particle rotates backw ards, follow ed alm ost im m ediately by a secondary im pact (backwards rotating) by the adjacent 120° vertex. The secondary crater profile is sm aller in both depth and length than the prim ary crater profile (Fig. 4.8). Previous studies involving im pact o f square plates [9] have also reported th e rem oval a m achined chip for backw ards rotating particles, and attributed the behaviour to a pure m icro-m achining m echanism involving the cutting o f the entire chip by the leading edge o f the particle. In the present study, how ever, this pure cutting action occurred only up to a point. Som etim es, the chip appeared to break o ff prior to com pletion o f the cutting action, resulting in the jagged crater edge seen in Fig. 4.8. This behavior is m ost likely related to the fact that particles w ith high angularity (i.e. A>45°) laim ched at shallow incidence tend to "tunnel" below the surface; i.e. both o f the

because im pacts w ith only square particles, for w hich tunneling is virtually im possible, have been previously studied. A nother exam ple o f this behaviour is shown in F ig.4.10 (a), w here it can be seen that, while the particle did indeed rotate backwards, it did not, how ever, result in a pure m achining action o f the type reported by Hutchings [9], and seen in Fig. 4.7 (i.e. the cutting o f a sm ooth crater as the particle swept along the surface resulting in a rebound

A detailed study on the crater volum es is discussed in section 4.6. It is evident from Fig. 4.11 (b) that w ith a sm all change in the orientation angle 0;, the rotation o f the particle changes from forw ard to backward. The tunneling o f the particle below the chip does not alw ays result in chip rem oval.

W hile tuim eling appears to occur in all the three cases show n in Fig. 4.12, the chip rem ains attached. The high angularity associated w ith the A=80° particles, results in a very deep indentation, and the chip slides over the top face o f the particle, w hich resists the rebound m otion o f the particle and influences the rebound kinem atics. 46

Condition for Particle Embedding
Papini and Spelt [2, 3] noted that the energy consum ption increases at high angles

o f attack.

A t angles o f attack close to a=90°, a particle is likely to lose all its energy at

some point during the im pact and rem ain em bedded. This, o f course, assum es that there is no spring back o f the target material. Papini and Spelt developed conditions for

angular particle em bedding into the target material, based on the principle o f conservation o f energy, w here all the incident kinetic energy is converted to plastic w ork (i.e. crater form ation). They suggested that the em bedding condition, neglecting friction, gives that the product o f dynam ic hardness, Pj, and final crater volum e (cross sectional area Acr tim es u nit thickness o f the particle) is approxim ately equal to the to tal incident energy o f the particle, or on a per unit w idth basis, given by [2, 3] ;

where, p is the density, A is the particle angularity, and h is the particle w idth . H ow ever, in reality, frictional forces resist the m otion o f the particle as it m oves through the target, form ing the crater, and a part o f the incident energy is lost in overcom ing friction. The above equations can be rew ritten for particle em bedding conditions taking frictional forces into account. PdAcr+ Frictional Energy Loss = ^ m V 4 (4.3)

Em bedding could be noticed in cases w here the particle struck the target surface at incident angles close to norm al to the surface [3]. The em bedding condition is useful for m easurem ent o f the dynam ic hardness Pa, o f the target (see Section 4.3).

Measurement of dynamic hardness and friction coefficient
The previously developed com puter sim ulation [2,3] requires both the dynam ic

hardness, Pd, and friction coefficient, p, as inputs. D ynam ic hardness depends on the plastic flow field in the target m aterial below the im pact, and is a m easure o f the resistance to plastic indentation [9, 14, 18]. In rigid-plastic theory, an average value o f dynam ic hardness, assum ed constant, is assum ed to adequately describe the force resisting the indentation. The dynam ic hardness is, o f course, m uch higher than the quasi-static indentation hardness o f the target; how ever, it is assum ed th at at such high rates o f strain, the value rem ains relatively constant over the range o f strains and strain rates occurring during the impact. In the past, for im pacts involving spherical particles, these param eters have either been chosen to best fit the experim ental data (e.g.

[18]), or by using an energy balance

m ethod [10] that involves the m easurem ent o f crater dim ensions for em bedding im pacts perform ed at norm al incidence. In the present work, a com bination o f the tw o m ethods w as used. For a tw o-dim ensional diam ond shaped particle launched at norm al incidence (a= 90°) and 9=0°, w ith zero rotational velocity, the particle w ill stay in full contact w ith the target for the duration o f the impact, and, neglecting elastic effects, lose all o f its kinetic energy to plastic work. Referring to Fig. 4.13, setting the incident kinetic energy equal to the plastic w ork done in deform ing the target, gives:

w here P is the norm al contact force developed on each face, m is the m ass o f the particle, V is the incident particle velocity, Ômax is the m axim um penetration o f the particle, and A is the angularity o f the particle. The assum ptions o f rigid plastic theory give that P=PdLw, w here w is the thickness o f the particle (out o f plane), and geom etry gives that L=0/cos(u/2-A ). Substituting these expressions into eq. 4.4, integrating, and solving for the dynam ic hardness, Pd, gives: 50

In contrast to im pacts involving spherical particles w hich gave, at norm al incidence, a unique ?d for a given crater dim ension, eq. 4.5 shows that there are an infinite num ber o f com binations o f ?d and p that m ight result in a given crater dim ension for im pacts o f tw o-dim ensional diam ond shaped particles at norm al incidence. N eglecting pileup at the edge o f the craters, the relationship betw een the m axim um depth, ômax and the length o f the crater, 2d, is ômax=d/tan(7t/2-A), so that a m easurem ent o f the length o f the crater will give the possible com binations o f ?d and p via eq. 4.5. Im pact experim ents perform ed using A=60° particles gave a crater depth o f 0.48 m m (average o f 5 m easurem ents) leading to the curve in Fig. 4.14. A single com bination o f Pd=440 M P a and p=0.3 was thus chosen from Fig. 4.14 such as to give a best fit to all the experim ental results. Similarly, this m ethodology w as applied for determ ining the com bination o f coefficient o f friction and dynam ic hardness for particles w ith angularities A =30°, 45°, 80°. The calculated values o f coefficient o f friction p, for dynam ic hardness Pa = 440 M Pa corresponding to particles w ith angularities A =30°, 45°, 80° were; 0.42, 0.39, 0.21 respectively. In all cases, regardless o f angularity, the value o f Pa w as kept constant and the fiction coefficient p, was varied to fit the experim ental results w ith the m odel predictions. This m ethodology was also tested by keeping the friction coefficient p, constant and varying the dynam ic hardness Pa. It w as noticed that both m ethods yielded reasonable experim ental and m odel agreem ent. Furtherm ore, the dynam ic coefficient o f sliding

friction p, is a function o f the local sliding velocity, w hich changes w ith the angularity o f the particles, a fact also noted in the results o f the finite elem ent m odel predictions (see C hapter 5). Taking all these facts in consideration, the Pa was kept constant, and the friction coefficient p, w as varied w ith angularity, for all calculations.

A description o f the model is given in Chapter 2, (section 2.3.1.4). As the m odel is based on solving the differential equations o f m otion in tim e steps, the required tim e step was determ ined by decreasing it until the model show ed convergence, i.e. the difference in rebound param eters betw een successive runs o f the m odel, was less than 1%. The final tim e step used in all sim ulated results varied betw een 0.01 and 0.2 ps, w hich corresponds to approxim ately 0.5% o f the im pact duration, but this o f course depends on the particular input param eters. A detailed algorithm describing the sim ulation program is given in reference [2].

Simulation o f multiple impacts: Particle Trajectory and Crater Profile

The com puter m odel as presented in Refs. [2, 3] considered only a single im pact at a tim e, and thus could be used to directly predict the rebound kinem atics o f the particle, for com parison w ith the experim ental results, only in the case o f single im pacts. In som e experim ental cases, m ultiple im pacts occurred, and one or more secondary im pacts occurred by the adjacent vertex o f the particle. The adjacent vertex that im pacted next depended on the type o f rotation o f the particle i.e. forw ard or backward. The com puter sim ulation com puted the direction o f the com ponents o f the resultant linear velocity vectors obtained at the end o f prim ary im pact and successfully predicted if the particle w as heading tow ards or aw ay from the target m aterial. Secondary im pacts in the case o f forw ard rotations could be m ostly seen in conditions w here the initial orientation angle was negative for the particle im pacting the target material. Exam ples o f such im pacts are given in Table A .l (see appendix). The rebound angular and linear velocities, and the orientation at th e end o f the first im pact could be used to calculate the trajectory and rotation o f the particle as it traveled through the air betw een im pacts, so that the orientation, velocity and angle o f attack o f the particle upon secondary impact, could be predicted, and used as input conditions in the m odel to calculate the kinem atics o f the secondary im pact.

Fig 4.18 show s the sim ulated trajectory o f the particle and the resulting craters for conditions corresponding to those shown in Fig. 4.5. N oting that the scales on these diagram s are different, it is evident that the largest crater is the prim ary, follow ed by the secondary, and finally the third. It is w orth noting that in all cases w here secondary im pacts were seen experim entally, the m odel also predicted a trajectory after initial im pact that indicated a subsequent im pact w ith an adjacent particle vertex. 57

4.4.3 Simulation of experiments involving chip break off/tunneling
For certain im pacts, there w ere inconsistencies in break o ff point o f the m achined target m aterial chip, as the particle tunneled below the surface, as explained in Section 4.1.2. This presented considerable difficulties when using the rigid plastic model, because it assum es that chip break o ff can only occur w hen the particle vertex has traveled through the surface and exited at Z=0 in Fig .4.1, and that the full contact force could alw ays be supported by the chip that w as being m achined. This im plies that the

force on the top o f the particle in Fig.4.9a would exist for the entire duration o f the impact. In this case, the secondary im pact o f the 120° vertex is predicted by the m odel to begin w ith the low er edge o f th e particle parallel to, and in full contact w ith, the target surface (i.e. at a secondary im pact initial orientation angle o f 0=-3O°), and exam ination o f the im pact site should reveal som e evidence o f the im pacting particle having contacted the surface along its entire low er edge. However, exam ination o f Fig. 4.8

reveals tw o distinct im pact sites. M oreover, were a pure m achining action to be responsible for chip rem oval, one w ould expect the secondary crater to be located a distance h=6.36 m m aw ay from the prim ary crater. Figure 4.8, how ever, show s th a t the distance betw een the craters is approxim ately 5.3 mm, w hich indicates that som e free rotation o f the particle m ust have occurred in the time betw een im pacts. In reality, it is unlikely that this full force w ould be supported by such a sm all piece o f material, and the chip was thus likely to break o ff earlier. I f earlier chip break o ff w ere to occur, there w ould instantaneously only be the force due to the low er contact segm ent (Fig.4.9c), resulting in an instantaneous increase in rotational velocity. This w ould lead to some free rotation o f the particle prior to the onset o f the secondary im pact, and. result in a slightly larger orientation angle than w ould have been predicted by assum ing the chip stayed attached for the duration o f the im pact (i.e. 8 >-30°), as dem onstrated in Fig.4.9e. The actual change in orientation angle depends not only at w hich point the chip breaks off, but also the rotational velocity at that point, bo th o f w hich are difficult to predict. H ow ever, it was found that by using th e rebound conditions assum ing no chip break off, but adjusting the initial orientation angle (0adj) for the secondary im pact in the sm all range o f -3O°<0<-28°, the data generated by the model, generally agreed well w ith experim ental results, as shown in Table A .3. Figure

4.17 shows the sim ulated trajectory o f the particle and the resulting craters, for conditions corresponding to those shown in Fig. 4.7, using the described technique. In addition to the chip break off, sliding o f low er edge o f the particle over the m aterial piled up at the edge o f the prim ary crater may also increase the orientation angle for the secondary im pact. It is how ever unfortunately not possible to quantify this effect. The conditions leading to chip break o ff are also discussed in detail in C hapter 5.

4.5 Particle Kinematics: Comparison of Simulated and Experimental Results
In this section a detailed study is undertaken to com pare the experim ental and m odel predicted data obtained for various im pact conditions for particles w ith different angularities. In general, a good agreem ent is found betw een the actual and the predicted results. F or all the angularity particles, the forw ard rotations w ere successfully obtained. The backw ard rotations, w hich occurred over only a lim ited range o f incident conditions, were obtained for A=45° and A=60° particles only, because o f difficulties in obtaining 2D planar im pacts for A?=30° and A=80° particles.

4.5.1

Rebound Angle (a^) and Rebound Velocity (Vr)

Figures 4.19-4.22, com pare predicted (i.e. from the rigid plastic m odel) and experim ental rebound angles, for A =60°, 45°, 80° and 30° particles, using the data from Tables A .l, A .3, A .13, A.15, A .19, and A.21 given in the A ppendix. The rebound angle predicted by the m odel w as typically shallow er (average o f 3° for forw ard rotating particles and 10° for backw ards rotating particles) than that m easured for A =60° particle (Fig. 4.19 a and Fig. 4.19b). Sim ilar observations w here the rebound angles w ere com paratively greater for the experim ental results as com pared to their corresponding m odel predictions w ere seen for A=45° (Fig. 4.20), A=80° (Fig. 4.21) and A =30° (Fig. 4.22). This phenom enon w as also noted in the rigid-plastic sim ulation o f spherical im pacts by a num ber o f investigators (e.g. [10, 14, 22]), com bination o f two effects: (i) The target m aterial is plastically deform ed, and the volum e o f m aterial indented by the im pacting particle is ploughed to th e edges o f th e crater in form o f a lip (Figs. 4.3 and 4.4). The actual instantaneous contact area and is likely due to a

betw een the leading edge o f the particle and the target m aterial w ould thus be higher than that seen in the m odel, w hich cam iot account fo r this pileup. This w ould deflect a forw ard rotating particle at a steeper angle than the m odel, w hich cannot account for this pileup effect.

Results and Discussion
(ii) Elastic spring-back in the m aterial is likely to give the rebounding particle additional velocity norm al to the surface [9] w hich cannot be accounted for in the rigid-plastic m odel. It is notew orthy that the greatest error in rehound angle is found for backw ard rotating particles, w hich give long and shallow craters, w hich w ould b e m ost susceptible to the effects o f elastic springback. Tables A .2, A .4, A. 14, A. 16, A.21 and A.23 show the percentage difference betw een the experim ental and the m odel predictions. In case o f A =60° particle (Table A .2 and Table A.4), for all experim ents, the average percentage difference was 25% for forw ard rotations, and 102% for the backw ard rotations for A -6 0 °. F or A =45° particle (Table A. 14 and Table A. 16), the percentage error for backw ard rotations was higher (27.6% ) as com pared to forw ard rotation (20%). Figure 4.23 com pares the predicted (i.e. from the rigid plastic m odel) and experim ental rebound velocities, for an A =80° particle, using the data from. Table A.20. Similarly, the com parison o f results for the various angularity particles are show n in Figs. 4.24 -4 .2 6 .

W hile the agreem ent betw een experim ents and predictions, in m ost cases, w as fairly good, the experim ental results w ere higher for both the forw ard (Fig.4.24a) and backw ard rotations (Fig.4.24b). This consistency in higher rebound linear velocities for the experim ental cases for both the forw ard and backw ard rotations could also be seen for the other angularity particles (i.e. A=80°, 45°, 30°) in Figs 4.23, 4.25 and 4.26. The average difference for rebound linear velocity betw een the experim ental an d predicted results for all the particle cases w as w ithin 20% in both forward and backw ard rotations, as described in the percentage difference Tables A.2, A .4, A. 14, A. 16, A.21 and A.23 in the Appendix. The elastic spring back effect described could also be responsible for this discrepancy.

4.5.2

Rebound Rotational Velocity, 8^

Figures 4.27 and 4.29 reveal that the rebound rotational velocity o f th e particle undergoing forw ard rotation is considerably higher than in the case o f backw ard rotation. T h is is b ecau se a sig n ifican t am ount o f the in cid en t lin e a r k in e tic en erg y

Results and Discussion
For m ost o f the particles undergoing forw ard rotation, the rebound rotational velocity is generally higher for the experim ental cases, as com pared to the m odel predictions, as show n in Figs. 4.27a, 4.28, 4.29a and 4.30. The reason for this could be the influence o f lip form ation (i.e. pileup m aterial) on the edge o f the crater, w hich creates a resistance force acting on the side face o f the particle, resulting in a resistance to its horizontal velocity. This resisting force acting at the side face o f the cutting particle induces a couple in the particle w ith respect to its center o f gravity, w hich increases the tum bling in the forw ard direction. The m odel cannot account for the m aterial pile up, and thus this effect is unaccounted for.

For the backw ard rotation cases, the particle m aintained its trajectory, losing som e o f its incident energy in the form ation o f the prim ary crater, and rebounded w ith a relatively high rebound velocity (see, for exam ple. Figs. 4.27 and 4.29). This resulted in low rebound rotational velocity at the end o f secondary im pact. For all particles (i.e. A=30°, 60°, 45°, 80°), the experim ental results fit well w ith the predicted results for the forward and backw ard rotation w ith th e average percentage difference being in the range o f 4 18% as could be noted from Tables A.2, A.4, A .14, A .16, A.21 and A.23.

In case o f backw ard rotation (Figs. 4.27b and 4.29b), no consistent trend in difference betw een predicted and experim ental results, in term s o f being higher or low er, could be seen. This is m ost likely due to tw o effects; (a) M ost o f the tim e, a prim ary im pact was follow ed by a secondary im pact. The m odel assum es that the particle m achined the target surface in a sm ooth m anner, but in reality, the roughened and jagged nature o f the crater surface, as seen from the experim ental crater profile (Fig. 4.8) influenced the rebound kinem atics o f the particle. (b) The tunnelling effect o f the leading edge o f the particle as it cuts through the target m aterial (as explained in section 4.1.2) and the inconsistencies in the chip b re a k off, influenced the force acting th e on the leading particle edge.

4.5.3

Energy lost in collision (KE lo^ s )

The total energy lost during the collision is o f particular im portance, as it represents the w ork done in plastically deform ing the target. As seen from Tables A .2, A .4, A. 14, A. 16, A.21 and A .23, the average percent difference betw een sim ulated and

Results and Discussion
experim ental energy loss was 2-8% , for both forw ards and backw ards rotating particles. In m ost o f the cases (Figs. 4.31-4.35), the m odel predicts higher energy consum ption than the experim ental results. T his could be possible due to the sp rin g -b ack effect in the crater (discussed in Section 4.5.1), w hich has been neglected in the rigid plastic m odel. As the energy lost in collision depends on the rebound linear velocity, the consum ption in cases o f experim ental results are lower because th e rebound linear velocity w as found to be greater for experim ental results, as is evident from Figs. 4.22A 24. Also notew orthy is that the energy losses, w hen expressed as a percentage o f the initial kinetic energy, w ere greatest in Table A.5; i.e. for experim ents conducted close to the transition orientation as com pared to conditions w hich are far from the transition zone for bo th the forw ard and backw ard rotation o f the particle (Fig. 4.33). Evidently, the lost energy goes to plastic w ork in creating the crater, rather th an being converted into rebound rotational velocity. Sim ilar behaviour was also noticed from the

characteristic curves o f Section 4.6.1, w here KEioss are higher at critical orientation angle (i.e. orientation angle at transition).

4.5.4 Particle Kinematics at the Transitions from Forwards to Backwards Rotation
To study th e eroding particle kinem atics in term s o f various rebound param eters, the characteristic curves (Figs. 4.3 6 -^.4 4 ) w ere plotted from the data presented in Tables A.7, A.9, A. 11 and A. 17 for A=60° and A=45° particles. For a given incident angle o f attack, incident velocity, and particle angularity, a critical initial orientation angle 0;°"% exists at w hich the transition betw een forw ard and backw ard rotation occurs [2, 3]. N ear this transition, rebound param eters were found to be extrem ely sensitive to input conditions. The experim ental data o f Tables A .l and A. 3 occur relatively far aw ay from this transition orientation angle, w hile Table A.5 presents data n ear such critical orientation angles (0;'^"^). For th e entire characteristic curves w hich involves A=60° and A=30° particles undergoing transition from forw ard to backw ard rotation, the behavior o f various rebound param eters (i.e. rebound linear velocity, rebound angular velocity, kinetic energy loss) changed at th e sam e critical orientation angle, identical conditions o f im pact. The critical orientation angle range o f 43° - 47° for A=60° and 34° for A=45° respectively. for th e corresponding w as found to be in the

Results and Discussion
It is w orth noting th a t the initial rotational velocity did not appear to significantly affect o v er the range considered in Tables A.7, A.9, A .l l , and A .17, lending

credibility to th e param etric studies in ref. [3], w hich neglected its effect. The agreem ent betw een experim ental and sim ulated results was very good and in all cases, the m odel ' predicted the correct type o f im pact (i.e. forw ard or backw ard). The behavior o f these characteristic curves given in Figs. 4.36 to 4.44 w ere utilized to support the explanation given fo r greatest crater volum es occurring at the transition, described in detail in Section 4.6.1.

4.6 Crater Volume: Comparisons between Predicted and Experimental Results
Figs. 4.45 and 4.46 show the com parison o f the crater volum es for the m odel prediction and experim ental results for A=80° and A=30° particles for the data taken from Table A. 19 and Table A.21 respectively. For both the experim ental and the m odel prediction cases, the particles involving forw ard rotations, consistencies in

overestim ation o f crater volum e by the m odel predictions could be seen w ith an average error percentage w ithin 25% (see Tables A.21 and A.23). Figures 4.47.a and 4.47.b illustrate the typical nature o f the crater profile for the experim ental and the m odel predictions in the cases o f forw ard and backw ard im pacts respectively. A good agreem ent w as found in the general shape o f the crater profiles except at the crater edges, w here the presence o f pile up m aterial w as found for experim ental results. Furtherm ore, the relative degrees o f indentation are low er in the case o f experim ental results, for both forward and backw ard rotations. T he reason could be the difference in relative energy consum ption for plastic deform ation, as explained in Section 4.5.1. The crater length (Fig.4.47b) resulting the experim ental case w as found to be shorter than the m odel predicted length. In the m ajority o f the backw ard rotations, the m echanism o f "chip break-off" earlier than w hen the leading vertex is above the target surface could be experim entally observed, resulting in shorter crater lengths, w hereas the model predicted a com plete cutting action o f the leading edge. 83

The m echanical uncertainty in shooting the particle from the catapult led to the incident velocities varying slightly for each o f the im pact cases. H ow ever, this small change in incident velocity did not significantly affect the particle kinem atics and crater volum e, hence an average value o f incident velocity, V, =25 m /s w as used in calculating the dim ensionless param eter, k\. Substituting the values o f dynam ic hardness, Pa = 440 M Pa, density o f particle, p = 8028.5 kg/m^ and average incident velocity, Vj=25 m /s, the dim ensionless param eter w as calculated to be 7ti =87.68. Fig. 4.48, Fig. 4.49 and Fig. 4.50 dem onstrate the experim ental and model predictions o f the variation o f dim ensionless crater volum e, 712, w ith the orientation angle, 6i, for an angular particle (A=60°) at three different angles o f attack, a=33.8°, 40°, 60°, for constant values o f tci =87.68 and friction coefficient, p=0.3. To construct this curve, the m odel was n m for different orientation angle, 8,, at a constant angle o f attack, a, to obtain predicted

The general shape o f the curves is m aintained in all cases (Fig. 4.32-4.33a), and the peak value o f 7t2 occurs at alm ost the sam e value o f Oj"^"', regardless o f the angle o f attack, a, signifying the im portance o f orientation angle, Bj, for m aterial rem oval. T he m axim um am ount o f m aterial rem oval (i.e., the crater volum e) occurred at the transition points.

4.50). ThuSj one w ould expect m axim um m aterial rem oval at norm al incidence. This, however, is not the case. For ductile erosion processes, w hile the craters are biggest at normal incidence, in m ost cases, they do not actually result in m aterial rem oval, but only plow ing o f the m aterial to the crater edges in the form o f lips. A ctual m aterial rem oval occurs when these lips are rem oved by subsequent impacts. The present m odel, in its current form, cannot account for these subsequent impacts. It w as also noticed that the behavior o f various rebound param eters show ed typical trends at the transition that resulted in the greatest crater volum es. This could be explained by considering each param eter individually as described in section 4.5.4 (Figs.4.36-4.44): a) The m agnitude o f linear and angular velocities is least at the critical orientation angle (Figs. 4.36-4.41). Thus, at the transition, the particle rotation through

the im pact is m inim ized, resulting in a significant am ount o f kinetic energy consum ed in the form ation o f craters (Figs.4.42- 4.44), as discussed in Section 4.5.4. b) Furtherm ore, Figs. 4.36- 4.38 show that a steep rise in the slope o f the velocity curve im m ediately after the transition point results in a rapid decrease in kinetic energy consum ed for plastic deform ation, w hich, in turn, leads to a steep reduction in crater volum e (Figs. 4.48-4.51). c) Figs.4.42- 4.44 dem onstrate that the kinetic energy loss is greater at the transition betw een forw ard and backw ard rotation as com pared to conditions w hich are far from the transition zone for both the forward and backw ard rotation o f the p anicle (see the KEioss values aw ay from Here, the m axim um incident kinetic

energy is consum ed in plastic deform ation o f the target m aterial leading to greater crater volum es. A sim ilar behaviour w as also noticed in section 4.5.3 (Fig. 4.33) for the data points near to the transition orientations as com pared to ones away from the transition. It is consistent that, in all the cases (Figs.4.48-4.51), the experim ental 7t2 values (i.e. the crater volum e) w ere sm aller than the m odel predicted ones. The reason is sam e as explained section 4.5.1; i.e. due to the presence o f the spring-back effect in the target 87

m aterial, w hich leads to higher rebound energy o f the particle, resulting in less plastic deform ation. It w as also noticed that the average percentage difference error in experim ental and predicted results for crater volum es decreased w ith the higher angle o f attack (see T ables A .8, A. 10, A.12, and A. 18). Here, the perpendicular com ponent o f velocity vector Vz, o f the incident kinetic energy required for plastic deform ation is greater, resulting in deeper craters, w ith increase in area o f the contact betw een the particle and th e target. The particle has also less rebound energy and hence a reduced spring-back effect w as noticed in the experim ental results w ith higher angles o f attack. It is notew orthy that the m axim um error o f about 30-50% w as reported while m easuring the crater volum es at these transitions. This is due to the fact that the erosion process is extrem ely sensitive to the initial conditions o f im pact at the transition. The chip form ation and break-off, and the resistance to particle m otion by the piled up m aterial at the crater edge m ay be the factors influencing the m aterial rem oval at these transition orientations.

Summary:
In this chapter, generally two types o f erosion m echanism s w ere identified, depending

on w hether the particle rotated forw ards or backwards. The forw ard rotation o f the particle plow ed m aterial into lips at the crater edge but no target m aterial w as actually rem oved. In the backw ard rotation, cutting or m achining action w as observed resulting in rem oval o f chip from th e target material. T o define the force resisting the indentation in the target m aterial, a com bination o f dynam ic hardness and coefficient o f friction was used. This com bination form s the single m ost im portant param eter in predicting rebound particle kinem atics and rem oval o f m aterial. The conditions o f transition o f particle rotation from forw ards to backw ards and m axim um m aterial loss has been described. Overall, it could be concluded th at th e rigidplastic m odel predictions showed excellent agreem ent w ith experim ental results in alm ost all the cases o f particle kinem atics and m aterial loss (i.e. crater volum es).

Finite Element Analysis of Angular Particle Impacts

In this chapter, a detailed finite elem ent analysis o f single angular particle im pact is undertaken to study the im pact behavior o f the angular particles, com pare th e results w ith the experim ental and rigid-plastic m odel predictions described in chapter 4, and to shed some light on the tunneling and chip break o ff phenom ena postulated in Section 4.4.3.

5.1 Schematic Modeling of Impact
The schem atic diagram o f the single angular particle (A -60°) im pacting the target m aterial is show n in Fig.5.1. H ere, in the 2-D schem atic m odeling, the plane o f the particle and the target is described in the X -Y plane, unlike the Y -Z plane used in the rigid plastic m odel [2].

In this m anner, the angular particles (i.e. A=30°, 45°, 80°) could be w ell represented. The particle is assum ed to strike the surface o f the target m aterial w ith its leading edge and rebound. T he im pact could be characterized by single im pact or m ultiple im pacts depending on the incident and the rebound conditions. The particle dim ensions and shape w ere m odeled using data presented in section 3.2, chapter 3. A typical m esh used in A NSY S 8.0, is illustrated in Fig. 5.2.

5.2.1 Preprocessing Stage 5.2.1.1 Modeling/Meshing/Element Type
This stage involved in defining the elem ent type, m aterial properties and geom etric m odeling o f the angular particle and the target material. The particle and the target are m odeled as a 2-D solid in A N SY S-LS-D Y N A and the erosion is analyzed per unit thickness o f both, the particle and the target. The geom etric m odeling o f angular particle depends on its orientation to the target material, therefore coordinates o f the particle vertices w ere obtained by substituting the particle angularity A , orientation angle 0, and side length h, in the inertial coordinate equation (eq.2.7 section 2.3.1.4, chapter 2). The target w as m odeled as a rectangle having thickness 3 mm. and varying length. As this w as an explicit dynam ic analysis, the elem ent used in defining the particle and the target is a PLA N E 162 element. The elem ent used is planer, defined by four nodes, each having six degrees o f freedom : translation, velocity, and acceleration in the nodal X and y directions. A fter defining the elem ent type, the geom etric model o f particle and th e target were m apped m eshed. In the present study, the target m aterial w as o f prim e concern, hence the num ber o f elem ents used for m odeling it varied betw een 5000-20000 depending on th e coarseness or fineness o f the mesh. For the particle, the num ber o f

elem ents w as four. In reality, because the particle was treated as rigid (i.e. non deforming), only one elem ent w as required, but four was chosen because it results in a node at the center o f the particle, thus facilitating calculations o f center o f m ass rebound velocity.

5.2,1.2 Material Properties
The "rigid -m ateria l" m odel is used for defining the m aterial properties o f th e angular particle. The input data required for the model are shown in Table 5.1 :

The tw o constraints param eters defined in this model are: (1) T ranslational constraint Param eter- Z-displacem ent (2) R otational C onstraint Param eter- X and Y rotate. T hus the particle was constrained from m oving out o f the X-Y plane. "Elastic-Plastic H ydrodynam ic m odel" is used for m odeling the target m aterial w hich undergoes large am ounts o f strain. The stress-strain behavior can be defined by the data points along the effective true stress vs. true plastic strain curve as show n in Fig. 5.4. The input param eters for the finite elem ent model are: density (D EN S), elastic m odulus (EX), shear m odulus (GXY). T he other input param eters that are determ ined from the perfectly plastic stress- strain curve (Fig. 5.4) for the target m aterial are: oo (initial yield stress), Sf (failure strain), ei-eie (effective strain data curve values, Oi-Oig (effective stress data curve values), and Co-Ce (linear polynom ial equation o f state constant). T able 5.2 illustrates the m aterial properties o f the target. Single surface 2D eroding contact was defined between the particle and th e target surface.

5.2.2 Solution Stage
The incident im pact param eters are defined in this stage, w hich include: linear velocity V, resolved in and Vy directions depending on the angle o f attack, a, and the

angular velocity G,. The target is constrained at all degrees o f freedom , so that it is static w ith respect to the im pacting particle. For the target, the num ber o f elem ents w as varied in the range o f 5000-25000 depending on coarse or fine mesh. Finally, the finite elem ent m odel was solved in tim e steps o f 0.9 ps, w ith elem ents num bered in range o f 1500018000, obtain convergence o f the solution.

5.2.3 Post-Processing stage
The p ost processing stage consisted o f calculation o f the sim ulated results o f the im pact. In the present analysis, the param eters undertaken for studies are rebound velocity Vrebs and crater dim ensions i.e. length and depth o f the indentation.

Initialization of Failure Strain, £f
In m odeling im pacts involving high velocities, investigators [30-32] in the past

have studied the variation o f failure strain Sf, o f the eroding m aterial w ith the incident velocity o f im pacting particles. It was observed that high strain rates influences the failure strain in ductile deform ations. H utchings [1 ,9 ] reported strain rates o f about 10^ to 10^ /s directly below w here the particle im pacted the surface. Sim ilarly, high strain rates w ere also noticed by Sundararajan [18] in his models o f plastic deform ation zones. H am ouda and H ashm i [30] plotted stress-strain curves for pure A lum inium at high strain rates and dem onstrated the difference in flow stress in quasi-static and im pact loading conditions. They noticed the presence o f higher flow stresses in the range o f 400 M Pa at high strain rates o f 10^/s corresponding to strain conditions o f 0.2 to 1.6. R upture strains o f 70-160% have been found for com m ercially pure A lum inium [30]. It w as reported that, for a fixed w all thickness, the rupture strain increases w ith th e strain rate. U nder high strain rate, exceeding 10^ /s. A lum inium and copper m etal cylinders have been found to rupture at 7 0 -1 6 0 % , and in som e cases even up to 300% strain. A detailed finite 96

elem ent study for the failure strain criterion on alloys o f A lum inium w as conducted by Rade V ignjevic and co-w orkers [31]. They reported failure strains in range o f 1.00 to 1.25 under the influence o f hig h im pact velocities. B ecause the strain rates in the presently considered angultir particle im pacts depended on th e num ber o f param eters including particle angularity, and the particular tum bling dynam ics o f the particle, the failure strain could not be considered constant. A t a constant yield stress (i.e. oo-oig = 440 M Pa) (see Fig. j.4 ), the failure strain Sf, for the target m aterial w as found to vary betw een 0.3 to 0.9, depending on the particle angularity A, the angle o f attack a, and relative velocity vector o f the particle edge indenting the target material. This constant yield stress value, (i.e.oo-aie = 440 M Pa), corresponds to the dynam ic hardness Pd, o f the target m aterial defined in section 4.3 (see chapter-4). Finite elem ent analyses w ere conducted for a tw o-dim ensional diam ond shaped particle (i.e. A=30°, 45°, 60°, 80°), at norm al incidence (a= 9 0 °) and 0=0°, w ith no initial rotational velocity, at incident im pact conditions identical to the ones used to determ ine the dynam ic hardness in section 4.3 (chapter-4. The dim ension o f the craters (i.e. crater length and depth) obtained from the finite elem ent m odel results (see Fig. 5.5) were com pared w ith the experim ental and rigid-plastic m odel results. G ood agreem ent was observed betw een these results as seen in Table 5.3.

It is noted that, at norm al angle o f attack (i.e. a =90°), the failure strain increased w ith decrease in particle angularity. Ls-D yna unfortunately only allow s for a single value o f failure strain to be prescribed, w hile different portions o f the target w ould be subjected to different strain rates, so the chosen strains should be regarded as average values for the w hole impact. W hile a highly angular particle w ould be expected to travel m ore rapidly during the im pact and the m aterial directly below the im pacting particle w ould thus be subjected to a higher strain rate, the m aterial adjacent to the sides o f th e particle w ould be subjected to a low er strain rate, as com pared to a blunter particle.

Finite Element Simulation of Forward and Backward Impacts
In th e FE studies, sim ilar erosion m echanism s (i.e involving forw ard and

backw ard rotations) to those reported in chapter-4 occurred. Fig. 5.6 show s finite elem ent sim ulation o f particles involving forw ard rotation, resulting in deep triangular shaped craters. The irget m aterial is ploughed into a lip at the edge o f the crater, as seen in Fig. 5.6 (a) and Fig. 5.6 (b). In erosion applications in w hich particle stream s are used, this piled up m aterial is prone to rem oval by a next incom ing particle, as discussed in section 4.1 (chapter 4). In the sim ulation o f im pacts involving backw ard rotations (Fig. 5.7), m achining

and/or cutting o f the target m aterial, leading to form ation o f a long and shallow crater, was observed. The m aterial loss occurs in form m achined m etal chips, ejected from the target m aterial (Fig. 5.7 (b)). As reported in Section 4.1.2, the backw ard rotations involved m ultiple im pacts, w here the prim ary im pact was follow ed by a secondary one. Fig. 5.7 (a) and Fig. 5.7 (b) dem onstrate the sequence o f prim ary and secondary im pacts, w here the first im pacts is a pure m achining action by the leading 60° vertex as the particle rotates backw ards, follow ed alm ost im m ediately by a secondary im pact (backwards rotating) by the adjacent 120° vertex. The bulk m aterial loss occurs at the prim ary im pact, leading to form ation o f larger craters in both length and depth, than the secondary impact. Also from the Section 4.1.2, it w as noted that, for backw ards rotation o f highly

angular particles, the particle appeared to tunnel under the target, and it w as postulated that, the m achined chip would, in some cases, break o ff prior to com pletion o f the cutting action. This theory o f appears to be well supported by sim ilar observations dem onstrated in Fig. 5.8, w hich shows the particle w ith high angularity (i.e. A >45°) tending to "tunnel" below the surface, w hen launched at shallow incidence (Fig. 5.8 (a)). It can be seen that both the leading edges o f the im pacting particle vertex are below the undisturbed surface. Tunneling action is predom inant in cases o f high angularity particles such as A=80°, w hich has a capability to indent deep into the target (Fig. 5.9). A t som e subsequent tim e step during the im pact, the particle rotates further and tends to "pry o f f ' a chip o f m aterial, leading to break-off from the target (Fig. 5.8 (b)). Thus the collision kinem atics is very sensitive at this point o f chip break-off, w hich significantly affects the prediction o f the orientation angle 6adj for the onset o f secondary im pact (see Table A.23 and A.30 in appendix). The solution to this problem for use o f the rigid plastic m odel discussed in Section 4.4.3; i.e. adjusting the initial orientation angle (8adj) for the secondary im pact, is well supported by the finite elem ent analysis results dem onstrated in Fig. 5.7(b). This figure show a larger orientation angle (Gadj >-30°), than w ould have been predicted by assum ing the chip stayed attached for the duration o f the impact.

5.5 Comparison of Finite Element Analysis Results with Experimental and Rigid-Plastic Model Predictions
In this section the finite elem ent analysis results are obtained for various im pact conditions for particles with various angularities, and com pared w ith the experim ental and model predicted data from chapter 4 .The tables and graphs illustrate the com parison o f data. In general, a good agreem ent is found betw een the sim ulated, experim ental and finite elem ent analysis results. Because the particular elem ents chosen in the finite elem ent analysis do not directly give rotational rebound velocity and rebound angle, these quantities are not presented. To m easure the crater volum es, the X-Y coordinates o f the crater points was plotted in sigm a plots (Systat Software Inc Point Richm ond, CA) and the area under the curve was directly calculated to give the area o f the crater w hich was m ultiplied by the respective particle w idth to give crater volum e. N evertheless, rebound

effectiveness o f th e finite elem ent m ethod in sim ulating the im pacts. This is borne out by the good agreem ent o f these param eters w ith experim ents.

5.5.1 Rebound Velocity (Vr)
T able 5.2 illustrates the average difference o f rebound velocities (Vreb) betw een sim ulated, experim ental and finite elem ent analysis results. A good agreem ent (i.e. average difference w ithin 15%) is found betw een the experim ental and the finite elem ent results fo r the general cases o f forw ard and backw ard rotations, w hich validates the assum ptions m ade in the finite elem ent m odel, in particular for dynam ic hardness Pd=440M Pa (i.e. yield stress oq) and failure strain e ra s described in section 5.2.1.2.

Furtherm ore, the average differences w ere w ithin 20% in both the cases o f A =60° and A== 45° (Table A.23 and Table A.25). In m ost o f the data in Table-A .23, Table A .25, and Table A .27 (see appendix), it is notew orthy that finite elem ent m odel results for rebound velocities w ere higher than the rigid-plastic m odel predictions for both the cases o f forw ard and backw ard rotations. H ow ever in com parison to the experim ental results, it underestim ated th e rebound velocities. This can be partially explained, based on the elastic and pileup effects discussed in Section 4.5, chapter 4. The finite elem ent m odel is able to predict the

ploughed m aterial at the edge o f the craters, as seen in Fig. 5.6.a and Fig. 5.6.b, resulting in an increase in instantaneous contact area betw een the leading edge o f the particle and the target m aterial. This increase in area induces an additional force (and thus velocity) com ponent norm al to the surface, w hich is unaccounted for in the rigid plastic model. In most o f the cases, the finite elem ent results are nearer to the experim ental results as com pared to the rigid plastic m odel predictions. This is m ost likely due to the ability o f the finite elem ent m odel to explicitly treat erosion, tunnelling, and chip break o ff effects. This further adds m ore credibility to the finite elem ent m odel selection for the finite elem ent analysis and the respective assum ptions m ade in the model. Furtherm ore, the finite elem ent m odel w as able to successfully predict the type o f rotation and rebound velocities for im pacts at the sensitive transition range, w here the particle undergoes transition from forw ard to backw ard rotation as defined in section 104

5.5.2 Crater Dimensions and Volume: Comparison of results between Experimental, Rigid-Plastic Model and Finite Element Analysis
Fig. 5.10 illustrates a typical crater profile predicted by rigid plastic m odel and finite elem ent m odel for A =60° particle at identical incident im pact conditions. Sim ilarly good results w ere found for m ost o f the other im pact conditions involving forw ard and backw ard rotation, and at the transition, b u t are not presented. Fig. 5.11 illustrates the crater profile dim ensions obtained from experim ental, rigid plastic m odel and finite elem ent analysis results for cases o f both forw ard and backw ard rotating im pacts. E xcellent agreem ent was found for the general shape o f the crater profiles, except at the crater edges w here the presence o f piled up m aterial existed for the experim ental and finite elem ent model cases. For sim plicity, in Fig. 5.12, the pileup was not plotted. Finite elem ent analyses w ere conducted for typical im pacts involving both forw ard and backw ard rotations and com pared w ith the experim ental and rigid-plastic m odel predictions, as shown in Tables A .23, A.25, A.27, A.29, and A.30. Tables A .24, A.26, and A.28 illustrate the average percentage difference betw een the crater dim ensions. C om parison o f crater length (2L) betw een the finite elem ent m odel predictions and experim ental results did not reveal any clear trend; how ever in m ajority o f the cases the finite elem ent m odel overestim ated the crater depth 8. This overestim ation w as also reported for crater volum e predictions by the rigid-plastic m odel, and is probably ow ing to elastic spring back effects discussed in Section 4.5.4. H ow ever, the agreem ent betw een the finite elem ent m odel prediction and experim ental result is reasonable, w ith an average error percentage w ithin 25%. The crater volum e characteristic curves w ere plotted for A =60° (Fig. 5.12.a) and A =45° (Fig. 5.12.b) particles involved in transition from forw ard to backw ard rotation.

5.6 Summary;
The failure strain is th e single m ost im portant param eter responsible for erosion o f the target m aterial, is a function o f indentation velocity and depends on the angularity o f the particle. The finite elem ent m odel predicts erosion m echanism s sim ilar to chapter 4 and show ed excellent agreem ent w ith the experim ental results including successful prediction o f the transition and conditions o f m axim um m aterial loss. This adds further credibility in selection o f finite elem ent model to sim ulate erosion m echanism s involving angular particles and th e relevant assum ptions o f failure strains and dynam ic hardness.

6.1

Conclusions
The main conclusions o f this thesis can be sum m arized as follows: · A n experim ental apparatus consisting o f a catapult-type particle launcher and a high speed digital cam era w as described and used to m easure incident and rebound param eters for im pacts o f w ell defined hardened angular steel particles against soft alum inum alloy targets. · Experim ental results w ere obtained for sym m etric angular particles o f know n shape, size and density colliding w ith a plastic target (i.e. A lum inium 3003) at arbitrary incident velocity, orientation, and angle o f attack. · Experim ental results revealed that, both ploughing resulting from forw ard rotating particles, and m achining, resulting from backw ards rotating particles, was identified as the prim ary erosion mechanism s. The craters form ed by the forw ard rotations w ere short and deep, w hereas the craters form ed by the backw ard rotations w ere long and shallow. In m ost o f the cases, th e backw ard rotation resulted in m ultiple im pacts; w ith the leading edge im pacting first, follow ed by the adjacent edge. · In contrast to previous w ork w ith square particles [9], the backw ard rotating particles w ere not found to m achine a chip to com plete rem oval leaving a sm ooth cut profile. Instead, the chip was often fbtmd to break o ff prior to com pletion o f the m achining action. This is because angular particles, in contrast to square

particles, ten d to "tunnel" below the surface and "pry out", rather than cut, a chip. The collision kinem atics is very sensitive at this point o f "chip b r e a k - o f f ', w hich

significantly affects the prediction o f orientation angle for the onset o f secondary im pact.

Infinite com binations o f dynam ic hardness and friction coefficient could be obtained to define the resistance o f the plastic flow field to indentation in the target m aterial below the im pact. B oth the strain rate induced by the im pacting angular particle, and the friction coefficient, at the contact depend on th e local velocity o f indentation. H ence, in dynam ic im pact conditions, no constant value o f dynam ic hardness could be defined for a type o f m aterial, for arbitrary friction coefficients and indentation velocities. In the present study, the value o f dynam ic hardness was fixed for all the experim ental conditions and the friction coefficient was adjusted to m atch the experim ental results. Furtherm ore, m odel predictions w ere also obtained by keeping friction coefficient constant and varying the dynam ic hardness. It is notew orthy that no considerable differences betw een the results w ere found. The experim ental data w as com pared to the predictions o f rigid-plastic m odel developed by Papini and Spelt [2, 3], and finite elem ent m odel, and very good agreem ent w as found w ith respect to the collision kinem atics, energy losses, crater dim ensions and volum e o f m aterial rem oved by single angular rigid particle im pacting the plastic target. The agreem ent confirm s the validity o f the rigidplastic m odel and finite elem ent model. The rigid-plastic and finite elem ent m odels w ere also able to accurately predict the critical orientation angle w hich defines, for a given incident angle o f attack, the transition from forw ard to backw ard rotation. This adds further credibility to the rigid-plastic m odel assum ptions and the relative assum ptions m ade in the finite elem ent m odel. The m axim um crater volum e occurs at this Tnis is

supported by the actual data obtained showing m axim um energy consum ption at

Conclusions and Recommendations
the transition responsible for m axim um plastic deform ation. Furtherm ore, for the same orientation angle at identical conditions o f im pact, the crater volum e increases w ith the increases in angle o f attack. · The spring back effect in th e target m aterial and the m aterial pile up at the crater edges is believed to be responsible for discrepancies in the experim ental results and m odel predictions for rebound velocity, rebound angle and crater volum es. The finite elem ent m odel w as able to account for the effects o f m aterial p ile up, but spring-back w as unaccounted for. · The failure strain criterion significantly influenced the finite elem ent m odeling o f the erosion m echanism . B ecause the strain rates in the presently considered angular particle im pacts depended on the num ber o f param eters including particle angularity, and the particular tum bling dynam ics o f the particle, the failure strain could n o t be considered constant. W hile a highly angular particle w ould be expected to travel m ore rapidly during the im pact and the m aterial directly below the im pacting particle w ould thus be subjected to a higher strain rate, the m aterial adjacent to the sides o f the particle w ould be subjected to a low er strain rate, as com pared to a less angular particle. A pparently the strain rate seen by the sides is m ore im portant, overall.

Contributions
T he m ain contributions from this w ork are: · Experim ental set-up and design o f the catapult apparatus to launch angular particles w ith know n incident param eters such that the collision occurs in a single (2D) plane. Such experim ents have never before been successfully perform ed. · Identification o f tunneling and chip break-off phenom ena in the im pacts o f highly angular particles. Such behaviour h as never been reported before. · M odeling and fixing the com bination o f dynam ic hardness and friction coefficient for particles w ith various angularities w hen im pacting a particular m aterial (3003 series alum inum alloy).

Recommendations for Future Work:
Only one m aterial w ith one velocity w as used in the present w ork, it w ould be interesting to explore different m aterials, differently sized particles, and higher im pact velocities. This w ould verify the dim ensional analysis o f Papini and Spelt [2, 3], w ho found the problem w ould scale. · Experim ents involving backw ard rotation o f 30° and 80° particles are extrem ely difficult to perform due to difficulties in obtaining 2D planar im pacts. im pacts would, nonetheless, provide useful data. · The effect o f initial rotational velocity is currently a subject o f debate in the literature. Use o f the rigid plastic and FE m odels, w ith verifying experim ents H owever, m odifications to the Such
