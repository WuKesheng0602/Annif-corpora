Abstract
Liquid D istribution and its Effect o f the Organic Rem oval in a Trickling B ed Filter M aryam Jedari Eyvazi M ASc, Chemical Engineering Program Ryerson U niversity Toronto, 2005

Propylene glycol m ethyl ether was rem oved from wastew ater in a trickling bed bioreactor under different liquid distribution conditions. A 0.3 m diam eter colum n filled with two heights o f 0.7 m and 1.4 m with 2 cm plastic spheres w ith were used. The wastew ater flow rate varied from 0.184 to 0.918 kg/m^.s. The effect o f the initial liquid distribution was examined using two types o f liquid distributors; a m ultipoint liquid distributor and a central single point liquid distributor. Over 96 hours o f treatm ent period, the BOD5 was reduced by 85% and 65% under the m ost uniform liquid distribution condition and the poor liquid distribution condition, respectively, achieved in this study. Increasing the liquid flow rate from 0.184 to 0.918 kg/m^.s, it increased the dynamic liquid holdup by 53 % and the apparent BOD5 rem oval rate constant by 23 % at 1.4 m bed height using the m ultipoint liquid distributor.

M oreover, with the use o f the m ultipoint liquid distributor, the apparent reaction w hen the liquid flow rate was increased from 0.184 kg/m^.s to 0.918 kg/m^.s. In addition, it was found that the effect o f an increase in the bed height on the percentage BOD5 rem oval was not significant when initial liquid distribution was uniform. Under the uniform initial condition, only 4% increase in the percentage BODs rem oval was observed w hen the bed height increased from 0.7 to 1.4 m w hereas w hen the initial distribution was extremely non-uniform, the percentage o f BOD5 rem oval was increased by 20% w ith increasing the bed height. The local distribution o f the BOD5 rem oval was not uniform across the bed cross-section and it was affected by the liquid flow distribution across the bed cross-section.

T herefore, eith er tertiary tre atm en t w as added to im prove the e fflu e n t quality, or trick le bed b io reacto r w as rep laced w ith an o th er process such as activated sludge. H ow ever, because o f low o p eratin g cost, reliab ility , stab ility and sim p licity o f o p eratio n , the trickle bed b io reacto r gained n ew p o p u larity in 1980s [2]. A lth o u g h the efflu en t from trickle bed b io reacto r plan ts o f earlier d esign w as o f p o o rer q u ality th an th a t from activ ated sludge plants, the p erfo rm an ce o f trick le b ed bioreactors d esig n ed m ore recen tly is com parab le to th at o f activ ated sludge p lan ts [3].

to 2.5 meters in diameter and from 0.9 to 2.4 meters in depth. The size o f rock varies from 2.5 to 10.2 cm [1] with a void fraction ranging from 40 to 55 percent (Figure 1.1). The introduction o f plastic media was a great success in trickle bed bioreactor manufacturing .The utilizing o f plastic media has permitted much higher loading rates as high as eight times o f conventional bed loading rate because o f much larger surface area, voidage (about 90%) and permeability o f this type o f packings. The plastic packing beds can remove biological oxygen demand up to 90 %. Moreover, the low bulk density o f plastic media allows deeper bed from 4 to 12 meters with a smaller diameter [1].

y

In trickle bed bioreactors, the wastewater flows down and trickles over the

packing surface where it is in contact with attached microorganisms. The microorganisms consume organic matter from the wastewater and form a slime layer (biofilm) over the

p a ck in g surface. T h e m icro o rg an ism s co n v ert th e b io d eg rad ab le organics and o xygen to carb o n d ioxide, w a ter and m ore m icro o rg an ism s. W h en the b io film is th ick enough, b o th aero b ic and an aero b ic zone exist in th e biofilm . In n er sectio n o f b io film w here oxygen d o e sn 't p en etrate becom es an anaerobic zone w hile the o u te r seetio n w h ich has enough ox y g en av ailab le fo r m icro o rg an ism s becom es an aerobic zone. T hus, a trick le bed b io re a cto r can p erfo rm b o th aerobic and an aero b ic d eg rad atio n o f organics.

Therefore, an optimum contact o f waste liquid and oxygen with biofilm is achieved and the organic pollutant is oxidized efficiently [6 ].

However, the hydrodynamic flow pattern in the trickle bed bioreactor is very complicated and is affected by the liquid flow rate, packing configuration, liquid distributor design, and packing height. A number o f studies have been done on liquid distribution in packed towers during the last century. Also, several authors have measured the efficiency o f trickle bed bioreactors for BOD removal under different operating conditions [1, 2]. However, little attempts were done to quantify the effect o f liquid distribution on the BOD removal in a trickle bed bioreactor. Recently, only Crine et al. [7] have studied the effect o f the liquid flow distribution on the removal rate o f the organic matter in a trickle bed bioreactor.

1.2. O bjective
In the present study, the influence o f the liquid distribution on the BOD removal was examined and quantified. To achieve this goal, the liquid distribution in a pilot scale trickle bed bioreactor was studied. The effect o f the operating variables on the liquid distribution profile and the dynamic liquid holdup were determined. Then, under various liquid distribution conditions, the performance o f the trickle bed bioreactor for soluble organic removal was studied.

Liquid maldistribution is usually quantified as a maldistribution coefficient that is a measure o f deviation from an ideal liquid distribution as described by the following equation [ 1 1 ]

M c=-

(2 . 1)

where M C is a dimensionless distribution coefficient,

is the average liquid flow rate to

a collecting cell, Qi is the measured liquid flow rate to a cell, and x is the number o f collecting cells. Equation 2.1 equals zero at the ideal liquid distribution condition and increases as the liquid distribution becomes less uniform [ 1 1 ].

Another method for detecting liquid distribution is the tomographic measuring method, which includes the X-ray tomography and the capacitive tomography. These methods are very popular in the investigation o f the hydrodynamics o f multiphase reactors [12-15]

2.1.1 Scale of Liquid Maldistribution
Two types of the liquid flow maldistribution have been recognized in packed columns; small-scale maldistribution or natural flow, and large-scale maldistribution or wall flow [16]. They are both well known to have negative influence on the mass transfer efficiency o f packed columns [17].

2.1.1.1 Small Scale Liquid Maldistribution

In randomly packed columns, the liquid flow over packing particles is severely maldistributed. It has been shown that for a uniform initial distribution o f liquid, liquid

c h an n elin g in stan tly occurs w ith in a fe w layer o f p ack in g th ro u g h w h ic h m o st o f liquids flo w s d o w n th e co lu m n [18]. T his type o f liquid m a ld istrib u tio n is k n o w n as sm all scale m a ld istrib u tio n or natural flow and is ch aracterized by th e n u m b er o f liq u id ch an n els and th e stan d ard d ev iatio n o f the local flo w rates [19].

S m all-scale m ald istrib u tio n w as suggested by W ang et al. [20] to be the resu lt o f the gas, liq u id and solid phases interactions o v er the particle d im en sio n . T he liquid stream s ten d to flo w certain courses in p reference to others due to ch an n elin g in p ack in g and thus give u n ev en liquid distribution. C h an n elin g o f the liq u id is co n sid ered an in h e re n t p roperty o f packings. It is believed th a t lo w radial d isp ersio n often causes charm eling [21]. T he radial spreading co efficien t ch aracterizes the liq u id d istrib u tio n req u irem en ts fo r random and structured pack in g s [2 2 ]. It is a m easu re o f h o w quickly a v ertical liq u id stream is radially spread as it flow s d o w n the bed th ro u g h the packings. T he rad ial d isp ersio n o f the liquid takes place at the co n ju n ctio n p o in t o f tw o p acking p articles [21]. T he o ccurrence o f the channeling p h en o m en a is in v ersely p ro p o rtio n al to th e rad ial spreading coefficien t o f the packing p articles [23]. It w as also sh o w n that

the center o f the packed bed. The tendency o f the liquid flow towards the wall region is called wall flow or large-scale maldistribution [26].

It is known that the wall induces a loosening o f the packing, which results in increasing the voidage at the wall vicinity. The tendency o f the liquid to flow in the vicinity o f to the wall is attributed to the lower resistance to the liquid flow because o f high voidage near the wall. In fact, in the wall region the bed void fraction approaches unity. This peak in the porosity at the wall causes greater flow rate o f liquid near the wall vicinity [27].

Wall flow, which is the quantity o f liquid flowing down near the reactor wall is measured as the ratio o f the total flow in the outermost annulus to the total area o f liquid collector in that annulus. W all flow is known as a major cause o f the loss o f efficiency in packed beds. Indeed, this phenomenon decreases the mass transfer efficiency due to the reduction o f interaction between the liquid and gas phases. Wall flow in trickle bed reactors has been widely investigated and reported in the literature. It is proved that the wall flow depends on the ratio o f reactor to packing diameter, liquid and gas flow rates, porosity, shape and orientation o f packing as well as physicochemical properties o f the liquid such as surface tension, density and viscosity.

2.1.2 Liquid Distribution Pattern

The 1950s literature reported the non-uniformity o f the liquid flow distribution in a packed bed. It was found that the velocity distribution in down stream o f the bed had uneven velocity profile with the largest value at the wall. More recent research work using more accurate measurements o f the velocity distribution, showed oscillating velocity profile with decreasing amplitude and period towards the wall o f the bed. Its minimum occurs at about one or two particle radius from the wall followed by an amplitude increase resulting in a maximum o f one at the wall. It was noted that the

T hese d iscoveries form ed the b asic b ack g ro u n d fo r later stu d ies on th e liquid flo w d istrib u tio n in a packed bed. V ario u s m odels have b een p ro p o sed in the literature to sim ulate th e flo w d istrib u tio n o f the liquid phase in ran d o m ly p ack ed beds. T he diffusion m o d el, p ro p o sed by C hila and Schm idt [29] used a p artial d ifferen tial eq u atio n to balance axial co n v ec tio n w ith radial dispersion. H o w ev er, the u n certain ty o f the b ou ndary co n d itio n lim ited its ap p lication [27]. L ater on, F arid [30] im p ro v ed on C h ila 's m o d el and p ro p o se d a d ifferential equation to describe liquid d istrib u tio n in the packing. T he au th o r d e m o n strated th e existence o f a potential force fo r the radial v elo city in a p acked bed due to the difference in the p erm eability betw een the b u lk and the w all reg io n o f the packing, and set a n e w bo u n d ary condition.

T he m o d e l w as also able to determ ine radial void fraction p ro file in d ep en d en tly .

T he m odel w as based on the analysis o f a bed as a co m b in atio n o f co n tin u o u s and d isco n tin u o u s system s fo r fluid flow b etw een vo id s in the bed.

fluid interaction between voids, and the fluid flow in the packed bed was similar to fluid flow inside a bundle o f tangled tubes. In comparison with other researcher's velocity distribution models, Subagyo's model was in better agreement with the experimental data.

While most o f the investigations on the radial liquid distribution were restricted to the single phase flow, Jiang et al. [35] developed a discrete cell model to characterize the liquid and gas flow distributions in trickle bed reactors. The model assumed that the liquid and gas distribution were governed by the minimum rate o f the total energy dissipation in the bed and incorporated the effect o f structural non-uniformities and different initial liquid distribution as well as particle wetting characteristics.

Later on, Kunjummen et al. [28] developed a model to predict the water velocity profile in the presence o f air based on single-phase velocities o f water and air, and dynamic liquid saturation. They proposed a dynamic liquid saturation factor to take into account the effect o f gas flow rate on the radial liquid velocity profile for two-phase flow systems.

Zimmerman and Ng [36] modeled liquid distribution in single phase trickle bed reactors by using a computer- generated, two dimensional packed columns o f uniform spheres. The model was able to predict the effect o f liquid flow rate, liquid density and surface tension on the liquid distribution. However, they did not take into account the effect o f the gas flow on the liquid distribution.

2.1.3 Effect of Operating Variables on the Liquid Distribution
The liquid distribution in a packed column under various operation condition has been comprehensively investigated in the literature [2 0 ]. W eimann [37] studied the distribution o f water in a packed bed o f rings and found that the portion o f the liquid, which flows close to the column wall, depends on the size o f the packings and the column

A large po rtio n o f liquid flo w dow n the bed in the v icin ity o f th e w all for sm aller co lu m n diam eters and larger packing sizes. B ack er et al.

T he discrepancies in the suitable value o f Dj/dp fo u n d in the literatu re fo r m in im u m liquid m ald istrib u tio n is due to the d ifferen ce in the type o f the pack in g u sed and the w ay packings w ere set in the co lu m n [46].

[47] also show ed th at the spherical p ack in g p ro v id es a b etter liq u id d istrib u tio n co m p ared to th e cylindrical ones.

P o rter and T em p lem an [40] show ed th a t for a giv en ratio o f the co lu m n to packin g diam eter, the in crease in the liq u id flo w rate reduced the w all flow . K u n d u et al.

11

reduce the wall flow. On the other hand, W ang et al. [20] showed that the wall flow was almost constant at different gas flow rates. Similar observation was reported by Herskowitz and Smith [42]. They also found that the influence o f the liquid flow rate on the large-scale maldistribution was less significant than that on the small-scale maldistribution. These findings suggested that the small-scale maldistibution was controlled by gas liquid interaction while the large-scale maldistribution was believed to result from heterogeneous bed structure, such as high porosity in the vicinity o f the wall and /or uneven voidage at the central area o f the bed.

Backer et al. [39] studies on the liquid distribution also revealed the insignificant influence o f gas flow on the liquid distribution. They also found that except for the case o f severe initial maldistributions, the liquid distribution was not very sensitive to the liquid flow rate.Their studies showed that except for the case with a single delivery point, the maldistribution coefficient was considerably low even at low liquid flow rates. A slight improvement was observed when the liquid flow rate was increased.

The liquid distribution at different packed bed heights has been well studied. AlSamadi et al. [11] measured the liquid distribution at different depths o f a packed bed using a 4-feet diameter packed tower under various initial distribution conditions. They found that the small-scale maldistribution decreased within the first
6

ft o f the packing .

A study by Doan and Fayed [49] showed that even in the case o f severe initial maldistributin (for a one point source liquid delivery), as the liquid flowed down, the radial liquid distribution profile became smoother, which was attributed to the internal distribution characteristics o f the packing.

W illiams and Xie [12] observed that the improvement o f liquid distribution at the top section o f the packed bed is temporary; as the liquid flows down the bed, the wall flow will start to appear finally due to the contribution o f the packing in spreading o f liquid outwards. Similar results were also reported by Albrite [23]. The author showed that non-uniform liquid distribution occurs in a packed bed if it is sufficiently deep, regardless o f the uniformity o f the initial liquid distribution. Seader and Henley [50]

Initial liq u id d istrib u tio n strongly affects the efficien cy o f a p ack ed colum n.

large-scale maldistribution resulted from non-uniform initial distribution over the packed column [38].

According to Perry et al. [22], the quality o f liquid distribution for each distributor depends on three factors: number o f distribution points (distribution density), geometric uniformity o f distribution point across the cross section o f the tower, and uniformity o f liquid flow from the distribution point.

A broad range o f the numbers o f liquid distribution point per unit area is used in packed beds. An adequate number o f delivery points is critical for liquid distribution in a packed bed. The regarded number o f liquid delivery points varies with the packing geometry due to the variation o f the radial spreading coefficient. For a packing with a high radial spreading coefficient, a distributor with a relatively small number o f delivery points would be adequate [11]. Therefore, the packing with a superior ability to spread the liquid is more desirable. These types o f packing not only provide a high efficiency for mass transfer through the bed, but also eliminate the need for expensive liquid distributors.

Leva [54] achieved better liquid distribution in a bed filled with S-LVK packing with a single point liquid distributor, rather than a 3-delivery point distributor, which was attributed to a relatively large value o f the spreading coefficient o f this type o f packing. It must be noted that this experiment was done in relatively small tower (16 inches diameter) and for the case o f larger diameter towers, it may differ.

Al -Sam adi et al [11] performed about 300 liquid distribution experiments in the packed bed o f No.2 S-LVKTM using 1 , 5 , 9 , 1 3 and 24 delivery points distributors. A significant improvement in liquid distribution was observed when the number o f liquid delivery points was increased from 1 to 5. A similar observation was reported by Doan and Fayed [49] for a 4-ft diameter packed bed o f 2 in. ceramic Intalox saddles under 1, 5, 9, 13, 24 liquid delivery point. They measured the liquid flow rate over the bed cross section at the

2.1.5.1 Liquid Holdup



Liquid holdup is one o f the important hydrodynamic parameters, which is used in the description o f the liquid retention in a packed bed [55]. It is also regarded as a measure o f wetting effectiveness [56-57]. It has been long recognized that the liquid holdup distribution affects the mass transfer and consequently, the overall yield o f the reactor.

Liquid holdup is defined as the volume fraction o f the bed occupied by the liquid at a given condition and categorized into three parts: internal, residual and dynamic (or free-draining) holdup. Internal holdup is the liquid held inside a porous particle by capillary action. It is important parameter only for the bed packed with porous particles. It was found that the internal holdup is not affected by the variation o f the liquid or gas flow rates and is usually complete even at very low liquid flow rate due to capillary force [58, 59]. The residual holdup defines as the part o f the liquid remains after the reactor has been completely filled with liquid and then drained. The static hold up is the summation o f the residual holdup and the internal holdup. The fraction o f liquid collected at the bottom o f the column after a sudden shutoff o f the liquid feed is called dynamic holdup [55,45].

It was found that the liquid holdup distribution is not uniform in the bed and is affected by liquid and gas flow rates, liquid initial distribution, packing size and shape, and wetting characteristics o f the packing [60]. Packing with a large specific surface can hold more liquid [61-63]. Moreover, the liquid hold up increases as liquid density

decreases, but decreasing o f the liquid flow rate and surface tension decreases the liquid holdup. Liquid viscosity has no impact on liquid holdup [61-63]. It was found that when the reactor operates at atmospheric pressure, the liquid hold up is independent o f the gas flow rate [64], but when it operates at high pressure, the effect o f the gas flow on the liquid holdup is significant. This is because o f the existence o f the drag force in the liquid- gas interface. As pressure increases, the drag force at the liquid -g as interfaces increases, which results in the reduction o f the liquid holdup [65].

2.1.5.2 Wetting Efficiency
W etting efficiency, which is defined as the fraction o f the external catalyst area wetted by the flowing liquid down the bed, determines the extent o f catalyst utilization. Partial wetting can cause incomplete catalyst utilization. This occurs when the gas and liquid flow into the reactor is low; hence, full coverage o f all catalyst particles in the column with a continuous liquid film is not realized. In contrast, the wetting efficiency increases with liquid and gas flow rates, and complete wetting can be achieved at very high liquid flow rate [69].

The wetting efficiency has been determined using two methods; reaction method and tracer method. In the reaction method, the rates o f the reaction in a three gas-liquidsolid phase flow trickle bed reactor and in a reactor completely filled with the liquid (complete wetting o f the packings) are measured and compared. Table 2.1 presents the models published in the literature.

2.2 Application of Trickle Bed Reactors for Wastewater Treatment
One o f the oldest fixed film bioreactors, used for treating wastewater for many years, is the trickle bed bioreactor. Among various existing fixed film bioreactors, there is a great attraction toward trickle bed bioreactors for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment because o f their simplicity o f operation and their low energy requirement and operating cost. They have been considered as secondary treatment for most wastewater amenable to aerobic biological processes.

2.2.1 Trickle Bed Bioreactor Theory
Trickle bed bioreactors are fixed film bioreactors consisting o f a bed filled with inert pellets on which biomass are immobilized. As the wastewater trickles over the bed and flows down, the organic pollutants are consumed by the biomasses and removed from the wastewater. The biofilm is attached to a surface o f the inert pellets and continuously exposed to the falling liquid. M icroorganisms form within the biofilm and grow by consuming the organics. The required oxygen for the biological oxidation is partially supplied from the air circulation through the bed and partially from the dissolved oxygen in the wastewater. Usually, natural ventilation, which is generated due to the temperature gradient between the wastewater inside the bed and the ambient, is sufficient to ensure air renewal and aeration o f the water; otherwise, forced ventilation should be used. Oxygen either transfers to the biofilm directly or diffuses through the liquid film [80]. Diffusion is known as a main process for transportation o f soluble substrate from

20

th e b u lk liq u id into th e biofilm an d th e m icro b ial b y p ro d u ct from th e b io film to th e bulk liquid. In the case o f p articulate substrate, th e substrate m u st be ad so rb ed on the surface o f the b io film a n d h ydrolyzed to be able to diffuse th ro u g h th e b iofilm . T h is p h en o m en o n is k n o w n to ero d e th e bio film surface [81].

U n d e r such co n d itio n s, trick le bed b io reacto rs can pro d u ce an effluent equal to th a t o f th e su sp en d ed g ro w th system s. T he liq u id re te n tio n tim e in the trickle bed b io reacro r is only a few m in u tes p ro v id ed th at there is an adequate am o u n t o f biom ass to rem ove th e organic p o llu tan ts d u rin g th a t tim e interval.

T h e organic loading rate and in flu en t organic c o n cen tratio n are am ong the m ain factors affecting the trick le bed b io reacto r efficiency for w aste w ater tre atm en t and have b een long u sed as a design and operating param eter. T he v o lu m etric organic loading rate is d efin ed as the am o u n t o f B O D o r C O D ap p lied to the trick le bed b io reacto r v o lu m e p er day and is e x p ressed in kg B O D /m \d a y or kg C O D /m \d a y [1]. It has been fo u n d th a t the p erfo rm an ce o f a trick le bed b io reacto r w as co n tro lled by the organic loading rate [82, 83]. In add itio n , th e v o lu m etric B O D loading has b een co rrelated w ell w ith the B O D rem o v al [ 1 ].

Previous studies on the removal o f organic compounds by trickle bed bioreactors showed that the percentage o f the BOD removal is inversely proportional to the organic loading rate, whereas, the rate o f BOD removal is a direct function o f the organic loading rate [84-87]. However, Schulze [8 8 ] found that while the BOD removal rate increased with increasing the organic loading, the BOD removal efficiency was independent o f the organic loading for values below 6.5 kg/m^day at a constant hydraulic loading.

Other study [89] examined the effect o f the initial organic concentration on the efficiency of the COD removal in a cross flow nitrifying trickle bed bioreactor. It was found that the percentage COD removal was an inverse function o f the influent COD concentration. However, the rate o f COD removal increased with the increase o f the influent COD concentration. Moreover, the plot o f the organic loading rate versus the organic removal rate exhibited two regions o f linear behavior. At lower organic loading rates, the rate o f the organic removal sharply increased with the organic loading rate up to a certain point, beyond which the slope o f the curve o f the organic loading rate versus organic removal rate became moderate. This indicated that the removal rate reduces at the relatively high organic loading rates. Raj and Murthy [90] found that an increase in the influent substrate concentration and hydraulic loading rate resulted in a higher concentration gradient between bulk liquid and biofilm, and thinner liquid layer on the biofilm surface, respectively. This resulted in an improvement in the mass transfer o f the substrate to the biofilm, which in turn increased the removal efficiency o f the bed.

Randall et al. [91] also reported similar results while investigating the removal efficiency o f a vertical flow medium trickle bed bioreactor for synthetic fiber wastewater treatment. They showed that although the amount o f organics removed in the bioreactor increased with increasing the organic loading, there was a maximum beyond which no more enhancement in removal efficiency with increasing the loading rate was observed. This phenomenon was related to the fact that the organic matters are removed from wastewater by adsorption on the biofilm surface. Once the biofilm becomes saturated, no more additional organic removal occurs [92]. Previously, the National Research Council's [4] data had shown that for rock media beds, the organic loading should not

Indeed, trick le bed b io reacto rs are categ o rized acco rd in g to the applied h ydraulic loadings. T he hydraulic loading rate is the to tal v o lu m e o f liq u id entering the re a cto r p e r u n it tim e, p er u n it area o f the bed.

S everal studies [94, 95, 96] show ed th a t in trick le bed b io reacto rs, the organic rem o v al is inversely propo rtio n al to an ex p o n en tial fu n ctio n o f h y d rau lic flo w rate and an in crease in the h ydraulic loading rate reduces the rem o v al efficiency. In fact, the hy d rau lic loading rate determ ines the liquid reten tio n tim e in the bed. A t lo w hydraulic lo ad in g rates, the liquid retention tim e in the bed is long and the organics can be co n su m ed by th e bio m asses com pletely. A t h ig h h y d rau lic loading rates, th e liquid re te n tio n tim e is relativ ely short and th e b io d ég rad atio n o f the o rg an ics m ay no t be c o m pleted; therefore, a considerab le p o rtio n o f the o rganic m a tte r leaves th e reacto r w ith o u t any change [87-90]. A lso, the im p ro v em en t o f the rem o v al rate w ith an increase in the hydraulic loading rate can be due to the red u ctio n in th ick n ess o f the stagnant liq u id film and the increase o f the w etted area [ 8 6 , 97].

D ick s and O tte n g ra f [96] found th a t the b io filter efficien cy increased w ith an increase in the liquid flow rate and attrib u ted this to the im p ro v ed w etting efficiency. T hey o b serv ed th a t at lo w liquid flo w rates, th e bed w as no t co m p letely w et and only p arts o f pack in g m aterial w as covered w ith th e b io m asses.

participant in the organic degradation at low hydraulic loading rates and the liquid, which reaches the lower part of the bed, does not contain a significant amount o f organic matter. At high loading rates, the substrate retention time in the bed reduces. Therefore, no considerable reaction occurs in the bed and high BOD concentration remains in the reactor effluent.

Parker and Richards [98] also reported the inverse effect o f the hydraulic and organic loading rates on the percentage ammonia removal for nitrification in a trickle bed bioreactor. They observed that when the organic loading increased from
6

to 15

kgBODs/m^.day, the percentage ammonia removal reduced by 85%. Moreover, Parker et al. [98] showed that increasing the hydraulic loading rate improves the bioreactor efficiency by increasing the wetted area o f the packings.

Bosco et al. [99] investigated the influence o f the superficial liquid velocity on the production o f exoenzymes in a biological trickle bed reactor. It was discovered that the superficial liquid velocity not only affected the wetting o f the bed, but also controlled the mass transfer from both the liquid film to the biofilm and the gas to the liquid film. At low superficial liquid velocities substrate mass transfer limitation happened. At these low velocities the wetting of the support was limited and thus, the substrate supply might not be available for the biomass in the entire bed. On the other hand, at high liquid velocities, the oxygen transfer limitation problem arises. In fact, the entire surface of support particles becomes wet under high liquid velocities; therefore, direct access o f the biomass to the gas phase is hindered. In this case, oxygen must be provided from the liquid phase and consequently the rate is reduced rapidly. However, further increase in the liquid superficial velocity leads to an increase in the oxygen mass transfer in the liquid phase and the overall transfer rate o f oxygen improves partially. Besides, higher

liquid velocities induce higher shear stresses, which may detach the biomass from the packing surface.

In contrast, Lunan et al. [100] observed that the total BOD removal efficiency slightly decreases with the increasing hydraulic loading rate. This was explained by the

Experimental Methodology
3.1 Experimental Setup
This study was carried out in a pilot scale trickle bed bioreactor. A schematic diagram o f the experimental set up is shown in Figure 3.1. The trickle bed consists o f a vertical column o f clear PVC with a liquid distributor at the top and a liquid collector at the bottom. The height and diameter o f the column are 1.8 m and 0.3 m respectively. The eolumn was filled with 2-cm plastic spheres. The packing height was varied between O.Vand 1.4 m. There was an opening on top o f the tower for natural ventilation.

A synthetic wastewater was prepared in a 350 L feed tank. Liquid from the tank was pumped to the liquid distributor at the top o f the packed bed. Two types o f liquid distributors were used in the present study; single-delivery-point and 25-delivery-point liquid distributors (Figure 3.2). The single-point liquid distributor was a vertical tube with an opening diameter o f 1.5 cm, whereas the 25-delivery-point distributor was a cross type distributor with six liquid delivery points in each arm and one liquid delivery point on the intersection o f arms. The size o f the liquid delivery nozzles was 0.3 cm. The distributors were installed at the top o f the reactor in very close proximity o f the packing to prevent water spreading to the column walls. It is known that a distributor with point density of 65 to 100 is adequate for initial distribution [22, 108]. However, it was observed that the liquid flow rate from each liquid delivery point o f the cross type distributor was not equal. Therefore, the cross-type distributor did not distribute liquid uniformly over the top o f the packing. The other distributor was a central single point distributor. This distributor could only supply liquid to the central part o f column. The drip point density o f this distributor is 14 points per square meter.

in feed reached 550 and 0 mg COD/1. It took about two weeks for the biomass to acclimate to PGME.

The effects o f the liquid flow rate, the packed bed height, the liquid distributor design, and initial organic concentration on the percentage removal and the

biodégradation rate o f the PGME were examined. The synthetic wastewater used for this study was a solution o f PGME at five different concentrations o f 100 ppm, 200 ppm, 300 ppm, 400 ppm and 500ppm. All the feed solutions were prepared using distilled water.

W ater samples were taken daily from the storage tank over the period o f 5 days during each run. The BOD and the COD o f the samples were measured using standard methods [110]. To investigate the effect o f liquid distribution on the organic removal, water samples were taken from selected cells o f the liquid collector while the reactor was running in continuous mode. The cells were selected in such a way that the samples located on a diagonal path were looked at. After that, the BOD and COD o f these samples were measured. The pH and the dissolved oxygen content and temperature o f the liquid entering and exiting the reactor were also measured. To do this, two wastewater samples, one from the bypass flow and another from the central cell o f the liquid collector were collected in BOD bottles in a daily basis during each run. All the measurements were done immediately after sampling to insure the accuracy o f results.

3.3 Analytical Procedures

3.3.1 Biological Oxygen Demand

The Standard BOD test was performed on all the samples during the biological phase o f the research project. The biological oxygen demand is an empirical test; it is used to determine the relative oxygen requirement o f waste and treated water. It measures

3.3.2 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)

Chemical oxygen demand (COD) o f the collected samples was also measured. The closed reflux colorimetric method was used for the COD test in present study. The procedure was performed according to the Standard methods [110]. The method was for mid-range COD concentration in the range o f 20 to 900 mg/1. A Standard 10 ml ampule was used for the COD assay. First, the tubes and caps were washed with 20% sulfuric acid solution to prevent any contamination. Then, the tubes were filled with 1.5 ml digestion solution and 3.5 ml sulfuric acid reagent. A sample was taken from the holding tank every 24 hour during each run. They were filtered to remove any biomass or other organic matter that would affect the COD results prior to each test. Vacuum filtration with a Buchner funnel and low ash 32 W hatman filter paper was used. 2.5 ml o f the filtered water was added to the prepared ampules and capped tightly. A blank ampule containing distilled water instead o f the sample was also prepared. A block digester (Bioscience, Inc.) was preheated to 150 and then the ampules were placed in it for two hours. Then, they were cooled to room temperature prior to reading their absorbance. The absorbance o f the samples was read at 600 nm directly with a Spectrophotometer (Orbeco-Hellige, model 975-MP, Farmingdale, New York). For each sample, multiple COD reading were obtained and average COD concentration was calculated.

Chapter 4 Result and Discussion
4.1 Liquid Distribution Profile
In the beginning, reproducibility test was conducted for the system at the bed height o f 1.4 m with the multipoint liquid distributor. The selected liquid flow rate was 0.734 kg/m^.s. The result is shown in Figure 4.1, which displays three different rtms. The data is plotted in terms o f liquid flow rate (averaged over three diagonal paths) against the radial position. As shown in Figure 4.1, the liquid distribution profiles o f the three runs are comparable to each other. The overall error was about 15% from the average value.

The liquid distribution experiments were carried out using a 0.3 m diameter column filled with 2 cm plastic spheres covered with biomass. The liquid velocity was measured using a liquid collector, which was installed underneath the column. Samples were taken at three diagonal pathways for each experimental run to investigate the angular variation o f radial liquid flow profile relative to the liquid distributor position. The three diagonal pathways and their position relative to the liquid distributor are shown in Figure 4.2. The average radial liquid distribution profile at the reactor outlet was determined by averaging the liquid flow rate obtained at the diagonal pathways.

The results o f liquid flow distribution measurements at the reactor outlet showed that the liquid distribution profile was not uniform. A plot o f variation o f liquid velocity with radial position is shown in Figures 4.3 to 4.5 for three different liquid flow rates. The figures reveal that the liquid distribution profiles are characterized by wavering behavior with minimum amplitude in the region near the wall area. Several investigators have obtained the same behavior o f radial liquid distribution profile [31,112, 113].

Kunjummen et al. [28] found that radial liquid velocity profile over any bed cross section was corresponded to the oscillation pattern o f voidage at that radial direction. This finding was also supported by the mathematical model o f velocity distribution o f single phase flow in packed beds, developed by Subgyo et al. [34].

In order to study the effect o f liquid distributor position (relative to the liquid collecting cell) on the liquid distribution profile, the radial liquid distribution was

measured in three pathways for a given liquid flow rate. The results showed that the radial liquid distribution profile in Path 3 has less variation compared to the other paths. As shown in Figure 4.2, one o f the liquid collector's branches lies on the collecting cell in Path 3 and the collecting cells receive the liquid mostly from that branch. However, the collecting cells in Path 2 and 1 collect the liquid coming from both branches o f liquid collectors.

4.1.1 Effect of Liquid Flow Rate
The averaged liquid flow profile was determined for five different liquid flow rates ranging from 0.184 kg/m^.s to 0.918 kg/m^.s at the bed heights o f 0.7 m and 1.4 m. Figure 4.6 presents the profile o f liquid distribution at the bed height o f 1.4 m for five different liquid flow rates of 0.184, 0.367, 0.551, 0.734 and 0.918 kg/m^.s. The liquid distribution profile was found to be more uniform at lower liquid flow rates. The

oscillation amplitude of the profile increased notably when the liquid flow rate increased to 0.551 kg/m^.s and beyond.

The liquid distributor used for this experiment was cross type distributor with one nozzle at the intersection o f branches and six nozzles on each o f its four branches. At low flow rates, due to relatively low liquid pressure inside the pipes, the liquid could not reach the end o f the distributor's branches and was distributed on the packing mostly from central nozzles. Figure 4.6 demonstrates that for the case o f multipoint distributor at low liquid flow rates o f 0.184 kg/m^.s and 0.367 kg/m^.s, the local liquid flow rate at

A s a result, all the nozzles o f the d istrib u to r p articip ated in distributio n o f liquid on the packing. T he n ozzle density o n the b ran ch es w as h ig h er than that in the intersectional area o f distributor. C o nsequently, the local liq u id flow rate at the center o f colum n w as su b stan tially low er than the area n ex t to the cen ter o f the co lu m n (Figure 4.6). A nother p o ssib le reaso n for low local liquid flow rate at th e cen ter o f the colum n at high liquid flow rates m ig h t be the h ig h er co n cen tratio n o f b io m a ss in central area o f the bed w hich b lo ck ed the liquid pathw ay.

F urther increase in the liquid flo w rate (up to 0.918 kg/m ^.s) re su lted in an in crease in the local liquid flow rates all over the colum n cro ss-sectio n w ith sim ilar trend.

Y in et al.

The results show th a t the v ariatio n o f liquid d istrib u tio n p rofile o f single p o in t distributor is sim ilar to F ig u re 4.6.

L iq u id flow rate profiles o f tw o liquid d istrib u to rs, u n d er d ifferen t liq u id flow rates, are co m p ared in F igure 4.7. The liquid d istrib u tio n p ro file o f m u ltip o in t liquid d istrib u to r w as sm o o th er com pare to that o f single p o in t distrib u to r. H ow ever, as it is e v id en t from F igure 4.7, the liquid distrib u tio n p ro file gen erated w ith both distributors follow s sim ilar p attern o f oscillation. As for the m u ltip o in t d istrib u to r, the radial liquid flo w p ro files o f the single p oint distributor had low er local liquid flow rates at the area n e x t to the c o lu m n w all and the local liquid flow rate at th e central region o f co lu m n w as h ig h e r th a n the overall average flow rate based on the co lu m n cross section. T his

in dicates th a t the non-u n ifo rm initial liquid d istrib u tio n at the to p generated by single p o in t d istrib u to r can be sm oothened o u t gradually as liq u id flow s along th e bed. T h is is due to th e ab ility o f th e pack in g to spread th e liq u id flo w radially.

47

Because liquid was introduced into the column through central region when using single point distributor, the local liquid flow rate at the center o f column was much higher in comparison with that of multipoint distributor, as shown in Figure 4.7. This is because a single point distributor did not spread out the liquid over the packing and the liquid entered the packing from the central region at the top o f the bed. Therefore, the local liquid flow rate in central area of column was higher than that o f other parts o f the bed. In spite of the relatively high liquid flow rate in the column center at the top, the local flow rate at the center o f the column is still lower relative to the region next to it at the bed outlet. This is probably due to the high concentration o f microorganism in the central area o f the bed as it was explained in previous section.

For single point distributor it was observed that the liquid didn't reached the column wall at flow rates lower than 0.551 kg/m^.s. This means that the packing was only partially wetted and the rest o f the packing remained dry. Since the dry part o f packings is not able to contribute in mass transfer process, the overall performance o f the reactor reduces. This would reveal the importance o f initial distribution on a randomly packed bed reactor's operation [22].

4.1.3 Effect of Bed Height

Liquid distribution profile was also determined at the bed height o f 0.7 m. Height o f the bed was reduced to half o f the initial height by removing packing from the top o f the bed. Figure 4.8 compares the liquid distribution profile o f two different bed heights at the same liquid flow rates using the multipoint distributor. The figure depicts that at the bed height of 0.7 m the liquid distribution is still far from uniformity. At this height o f the bed the liquid distribution profile was characterized by very high flow at the center. The liquid distribution profile obtained at the 1.4 m bed height was comparatively evener than that o f the 0.7 m bed height. Scott [114] suggested that the effect o f

distributor was used (Figure 4.9). This is in agreement with the results o f other authors [11]. However, very small reduction o f maldistribution coefficient was observed with the increase o f liquid flow rate from 0.184 kg/m^.s to 0.918 kg/m^.s. At the high liquid flow rates, the wall flow started to build up at the shorter depth o f the bed, and thus, the liquid wall flow existed at the bed outlet where maldistribution coefficient was measured. Existence o f the wall flow increased the maldistribution coefficient at higher flow rates. This in turn negated the improvement o f liquid distribution due to high flow rate. However, when the bed height of the bed reduced to 0.7m, no wall flow was observed at any liquid flow rate. Hence, the maldistribution coefficient decreased when liquid flow rate was increased (Figure 4.10).

For the case of the single point distributor, the maldistribution coefficient was appeared to increase with increasing the liquid flow rate. In fact, at the low liquid flow rates o f 0.184kg/m^.s and 0.376 k g W .s, quite smooth profiles o f the liquid distribution were attained as depicted in Figure A .l, which might result in the low value o f maldistribution coefficient. Also, as liquid flow rate increased, the liquid appeared to flow primarily in the central area o f the column possibly due to a low spreading coefficient o f the packing. Thus, extremely uneven liquid distribution profile was attained at high liquid flow rates. The highly non-uniform distribution o f liquid at the bed outlet led to the high maldistribution coefficient at high liquid flow rates. Finally, the maldistribution coefficient increased when the liquid flow rate increased.

A comparison o f the liquid maldistribution coefficient for the two types o f liquid distributors is shown in Figure 4.9. Obviously, the initial liquid distribution affected the liquid distribution in the bed as shown in Figure 4.9. The maldistribution coefficient was significantly less for the multipoint delivery distributor compared to that o f the single delivery point distributor, which was resulted from the more uniform initial liquid distribution achieved by the multipoint delivery distributor.

The dynamic holdup increased with the liquid flow rate as shown in Figure 4.11. It is generally believed that the dynamic holdup includes liquid films and rivulets [46]. The relative amount o f these elements fluctuates primarily with the liquid flow rate [36]. At low liquid flow rates, liquid holdup is formed mainly o f liquid films and only a small number o f rivulets. As the liquid flow rate increases, the number o f the rivulets and their size increase and consequently the liquid holdup increases [115]. The observed increase in the liquid holdup with the liquid flow rate is in agreement with the correlation proposed by Billet [116]. The correlation is written as follows

/ h=

s2/3

(4 2)
\ « y

where h is the liquid holdup, g is the gravity acceleration, j^i is the dynamic viscosity o f the liquid, p i is the density o f the liquid, a is the total surface area per unit volume o f the packed column and column. is the hydraulic area o f packing per unit volume o f the packed

The influence o f the liquid flow rate on the liquid hold up at the different bed heights was found to be qualitatively similar. However, Figure 4.11 shows the dynamic holdup is affected by the bed height. The holdup values for the bed height of 1.4 m were lower than that o f for 0.7 m. These results are in agreement with the results o f Lakota and Levee [74]. They related this to the non-uniform liquid distribution in longer bed heights. However, our results showed that the liquid distribution was more uniform at the 1.4 m tall bed than that o f the 0.7 m tall bed. On the other hand, for a given liquid flow rate the quantity of the drained liquid for the 1.4m bed height was higher than that o f the 0.7 m for (Figure 4.12). In the present study, the measured volume o f drained liquid was indeed the sum o f the volume o f moving liquid inside the bed and the volume o f the liquid inside the distributor. The volume o f the liquid inside the distributor was the same for both bed heights. This volume of liquid contributed more to the liquid holdup for shorter bed since it was divided to a smaller column volume o f the shorter bed. This resulted in an increase in the higher values o f the liquid holdup obtained for the shorter bed o f 0.7 m height.

Liquid holdup values for the single delivery point distributor were compared to those for the multipoint distributor at the same bed height. The dynamic liquid holdup values obtained using the multipoint distributor was higher than that o f the single delivery point distributor (Figure 4.13). The values o f liquid holdup for both distributors were calculated at the same bed height o f 1.4 m, thus, the volume o f the liquid inside the distributors contributed to the dynamic liquid holdup calculation equally. Lower liquid holdup values for the case of the single point distributor compare to those o f the multipoint distributor possibly resulted from less uniform liquid distribution attained using the single point distributor. This also reflected by the higher M C values for the single point distributor as previously shown in Figure 4.9.

Furthermore, the effect of the presence of biofilm on liquid holdup was investigated. The dynamic liquid holdup was measured at various liquid flow rates for the 0.7 m height bed filled with the packing covered with biomass and the clean packing. It appeared that the presence o f biomass causes a considerable influence in the dynamic holdup. As shown in Figure 4.14, the dynamic liquid holdup was higher for the packing with the biomass. This phenomenon was more pronounced at higher liquid flow rates. This result is in agreement with the results o f other authors who showed that the presence o f the biofilm had a positive effect on the wetted area o f the packing surface [117,118] and the wetted area increased with the biofilm growth [119].

4.4 Biological Treatm ent of Propylene G lycol M ethyl Ether
4.4.1 Biodégradation Rate of Propylene Glycol Methyl Ether
To find the kinetic rate constants, the mechanism o f biological oxidation should be studied. In the absence o f such information o f the biooxidation o f PGM E, the experiments in the present study were used to obtain the overall biodégradation rate reaction. As shown in Figures 4.15, a good linear relationship o f-In (COD/CODo) versus time was obtained with the regression coefficients o f over 0.9 for all initial concentration of PGME used. The degradation rate of PGME in the trickle bed bioreactor appeared to follow first-order reaction kinetics since the plots o f -In (COD/CODo) versus time were straight lines with different slopes depending on the initial concentration o f PGME. The values o f the reaction rate constant in the present study were for 72-hours o f treatment.

Several authors have shown that the kinetic o f biodégradation in a trickle bed bioreactor follows first-order reaction kinetics [1, 120], especially at low substrate concentrations [121]

where kp is an apparent rate constant experimentally determined and C is the removable COD (or BOD) concentration at time t. On the other hand, the reaction rate for attached growth systems is related not only to the removable BOD concentration but also to diffusion-affected factors on and within the biofilm [122].

Generally, three major steps occur in overall process when a substrate is utilized by the biological films [123]:

T h erefo re, the m ass tran sfer o f su b strate

through the liquid film was high. This indicates that the overall degradation rate was not mass transfer limited in this region and was controlled by the rate o f the biodégradation. At the organic concentration o f 300 ppm and lower, the rate of the substrate uptake by the microorganisms was faster than the rate o f mass transport due to the relatively low concentration gradient between the bulk liquid and the liquid film. Consequently, the mass transfer of the substrate from the bulk liquid controlled the overall rate o f organic degradation.

Although the relatively high amount o f the PGME was removed with the higher initial PGME concentrations but, the percentage removal was lower than that o f the lower initial concentrations. Figure 4.17 shows the profile o f the percentage BOD removal during 72 hours of treatment period with different initial organic concentrations o f PGME. For the lowest initial PGME concentration o f 100 ppm, the percentage BOD

removal after 72 hours o f treatment was 62%. As the organic initial concentration was increased from 100 to 500 mg/1, the percentage BOD removal decreased from 62 to 37%. This was also illustrated in the plot o f the percentage BOD; removed after 72 hours o f treatment versus initial PGME concentration in Figure 4.18. The figure depicts that an increase in the initial PGME concentration has negative effect on the percentage BOD; removal. A similar relationship was obtained for the %COD removal (Figure A.2) when plotted against the initial concentration o f PGME. A similar result was reported by Lunan et al. [124]. This phenomenon can be explained by the reduction o f the rate o f the

degradation at the high initial PGME concentration o f 400 and 500 ppm as depicted in their profiles in Figure 4.17. The reduction in the rate o f degradation is attributable to the saturation o f the biofilm surface with PGME [92]. Once the surface o f the biofilm becomes saturated, no mass transfer limitation happens and the overall degradation rate is controlled by the rate biodégradation. The biodégradation is a slow process and results in a reduction o f the overall degradation rate.

The reduction o f the apparent reaction rate constant with the increase o f the initial PGM E concentration was also shown in Figure 4.19. These data were obtained from the

4.4.3 Effect of Liquid Flow Rate
Experiments were carried out to study the effect o f flow rate on the biodégradation o f PGME in a trickle bed reactor with a constant initial PGM E concentration. Five different liquid flow rates were examined, ranging from 0.184 kg/m^.s to 0.918 kg/m^.s. The initial concentration o f PGME was kept at 300 ppm for all runs.

Figure 4.20 depicts the reduction in BOD 5 during the 96 hours o f treatment for five different liquid flow rates using the multipoint distributor. During the first 48 hours of treatment, the PGME removal was quite fast with about 75% o f the BOD removal. The removal rate then decreased during the next 48-hour of treatment. At first hours o f treatment, the concentration of PGME was high. Therefore, the rate o f transfer o f the organic from the bulk liquid to the surface of biofilm was high. Consequently, the BOD removal rate was high. After that, due to fast degradation o f PGME, its concentration was reduced considerably which led to reduction in the mass transfer rate and ultimately the removal rate of PGME decreased. A similar trend was also observed with the percent o f organic removal expressed in terms o f COD (Figure A.3). A decrease in the removal rate of the COD with decreasing influent COD concentration has been also shown by Raj and Murthy [89-90].

It was observed that the removal o f the BOD5 did not follow any clear trend especially at the region of low removal rate, but, at the end o f 96 hours o f treatment, higher liquid flow rates appeared to result in a greater percentage removal. In a study on biological oxidation of PGME in an aerated packed column, Doan and Wu [127] observed similar results. The slow kinetics o f the biological oxidation is possibly

responsible for this observation [128]. The rate o f oxygen consumption by the biological oxidation in the wastewater was much lower than the rate o f oxygen transfer from the air to water in the packed column. Therefore, the oxygen content was maintained at an

72

adequate level for BOD reduction. Consequently, the BOD removal was not affected by
the liq u id flo w rate [129].

F igure 4.21 depicts the effect o f liquid flo w rate on the percentage B O D 5 rem o v ed after 96 hours o f treatm ent. A t the liquid flo w rate o f 0.184 kg/m ^.s, the percen tag e B O D 5 rem oval w as about 80%. A n increase in the liquid flo w rate from 0.184 kg/m .s to 0.918 kg.m ^.s resulted in m arginal increase in the percentage B O D 5 rem oval

from 80% to 85% after 96 hours o f treatm ent. This indicates that the B O D 5 rem oval w as affected in sig n ifican tly by the liquid flow rate over the range used in the p resen t study. T his resu lt is in co n trast w ith other published results. G enerally, it w as found th at the rem o v al p ercen tag e decreased w ith increasing the liquid flow rate due to the decrease in the liq u id resid en ce tim e inside the reactor [89-90]. In present study, th e trick le bed b io re a cto r w as ru n in batch m ode w ith continuous recycle o f the liquid. In th is case, a lth o u g h fo r each single pass, the liquid residence tim e decreases w ith in creasin g the liq u id flo w rate, but the num ber o f the passes increased. T hus, for all runs regardless o f the ap p lied liq u id flo w rate, the liquid residence tim e inside the reacto r w as in fact the sam e ov er the d u ratio n o f the tim e.

A slight increase in percentage B O D 5 rem oval can be attrib u ted to m ore w etted area o f p ack in g s for m ass transfer, attained at hig h er liquid flo w rates. It is k now n th at the ov erall m icro b ial activity is proportional to the w etting efficiency [118]. In fact, the m ore p a ck in g get w et, the m ore biofilm is developed on it [122,129]. In section 4.2.1, it w as sh o w n th a t by in creasin g the liquid flow rate in the trick le bed bio reacto r, th e liquid d istrib u te d m ore unifo rm ly in the bed. This in tu rn increased the dynam ic liquid holdup. T h e in crease o f the dynam ic liquid holdup, w hich is the w etting efficiency ex ten t [57], w as b e n eficial since it im proved the contact o f the w astew ater and biofilm . H ence, the organic re m o v al im proved. The increase o f the % B O D rem oved w ith the dynam ic liquid h o ld u p is sh o w n in F igure 4.22. F urtherm ore, in ord er to clarify the effect o f the liquid d istrib u tio n on th e organic rem oval rate, p ercentage B O D 5 rem oval and m ald istrib u tio n c o effic ien t v ersus liquid flow rate w ere plotted in F igure 4.23 for the b ed heights o f 1.4 m . T h e resu lt elucidates th a t w h ile the m ald istrib u tio n co efficien t decreases w ith

73

increasing the liquid flow rate, the percentage BOD 5 removal increases. At the higher liquid flow rates, where liquid distribution is more uniform and the maldistribution coefficient is comparatively lower, the higher percentage o f BOD; is removed. The same experiment was also done at the bed height o f the 0.7 m and the plot can be found in appendix A (Figure A.4). The variation o f the maldistribution coefficient and percentage BOD; removal versus the liquid flow rate had the same trend o f Figure 4.23.

In addition, Satterfield [70] has shown that the apparent reaction rate constant is proportional to liquid hold up.

The increase of reaction conversion with the liquid hold up can be clearly seen from the following empirical correlation for a first order reaction [70]

where C and Co are the organic concentration in the influent and effluent, kp is the apparent rate constant ky is the first order reaction rate constant, h is the liquid holdup and LH SV is the volume o f liquid fed to reactor per hour per volume o f reactor. This explanation is consistent with the results obtained in the present study. As shown in Figure 4.24, the increase in liquid flow rate has positive effect on the apparent reaction constant due to the improvement of liquid distribution in the bed and thus, the increase of dynamic liquid holdup.

4.4.4 Effect of Initial Liquid Distribution
The effect o f the initial liquid distribution on the BOD removal efficiency was investigated using two types o f the liquid distributor: a single delivery point distributor and a multipoint delivery distributor. For each o f the liquid distributors, the experiment was performed at three liquid flow rates o f 0.184, 0.551 and 0.918 kg/m^.s. The height o f the bed and the initial PGME concentration were 1.4 m and 300 ppm respectively. The COD and BOD 5 concentrations were measured over a period of 72 hours for each run.

Figure 4.25 to 4.27 compares the COD profiles o f the multipoint distributor and the single point distributor during 72 hours o f treatment. As shown in figure 4.25, at the low liquid flow rate of 0.184 k g W .s , the use of multipoint liquid distributor did not show any advantage over the single point distributor. It was previously shown that at the low liquid flow rate of 0.184 k g W .s, both o f the liquid distributors operate similarly. Therefore, the wetted area o f the bed and consequently the amount o f the organic removed at any time was equal for both types o f liquid distributor used. As the liquid flow rate increased, the higher percentage o f COD was removed when the multipoint distributor was used at a given time and liquid flow rate. Since at higher liquid flow rates, the multipoint distributor spread the liquid out more uniform than the single point distributor, the fraction o f the packing, which was wetted, was higher than that o f the single point distributor. The increase in the wetted area had a positive effect on the organic biodégradation rate via increasing the surface for mass transfer and thus, increased the percentage COD removal.

In Figure 4.28, the percentage BOD 5 removal is plotted as a function o f liquid flow rate for both types o f liquid distributors. As shown in Figure 4.28, the percentage BOD 5 removal improved with increasing the liquid flow rate regardless o f the initial liquid distributor design. In the case of multipoint liquid distributor, the increase in the BOD removal is due to improvement of the liquid distribution by increasing liquid flow rate as elucidated in Figure 4.23. But for the single point distributor, the increase o f liquid

flow rate not only did not improve the uniformity o f the liquid distribution, but also degraded it. In fact, for the single point distributor, both the maldistribution coefficient and the percentage BOD 5 removal increased with the liquid flow rate as shown in Figure 4.29. The increase o f the percentage BOD 5 removal with the liquid flow rate was possibly due to the improvement o f mass transfer rate by increasing the liquid flow rate [126].

4.4.5 Effect of Filter Height
The amount o f BOD 5 removed over 72 hours of treatment was measured at bed heights of 0.7 m and 1.4 m under liquid flow rates o f 0.184 to 0.918 kg/m^.s. The obtained data are presented in Figure 4.30. The results showed that the percentage BOD 5 removal for 1.4m bed height was greater than that of the 0.7 m bed at any liquid flow rate (Figure 4.30). The improvement of the percentage BOD 5 removal with the bed height can be due to the increase of the liquid retention time in the bed when the height o f bed increased. As a result, the organics has more time to contact with biomass and be removed. Many published researches have also shown that the fraction o f the BOD removed is a function of the liquid retention time inside the biofilter [107, 105, 130]. Besides, Howland [131] showed that the liquid retention time is directly proportional to the depth o f bed.

Furthermore, the uniformity of the liquid distribution was improved when the bed height was increased. This is also reflected in smaller maldistribution coefficient values o f the taller bed compare to those of the shorter bed as shown in Figure 4.9. The better liquid distribution at the higher bed height created more wetted area for mass transfer. Therefore, the biodégradation rate increased with bed height.

Figure 4.30 also depicts that when the liquid flow rate was increased, the percentage organic removal o f the shorter bed increased and approached the value o f the higher bed. Indeed, at the liquid flow rate of the 0.918 k g /m ls, only 4% more organic was removed when the height o f the bed increased from 0.7 to 1.4m. Whereas, at the

86

liquid flo w rate o f 0.184 kg/m ^.s , the increase o f th e bed height, increased the percentage organic rem o v al by about 20% . A sim ilar trend w as observed for m ald istrib u tio n co efficien t v a lu es o f 1.4 m and 0.7 m bed heights w ith increasing the liquid flow rate (F igure 4.10).

S atterfield [70] has also reported the increase in the rate o f co nversion w itli the bed h e ig h t at a giv en liquid velocity and attributed it to the reduction in axial d ispersio n and th e in creased liq u id holdup w ith increasing the b ed height. A lso, H enry and G ilbert [60] re p o rte d a sim ilar relationship betw een the organic rem oval rate and th e bed h eig h t and p ro p o se d th e fo llo w in g correlation.

4.5 Effect o f Liquid Distribution on Local BOD Rem oval

In o rd e r to determ ine the effect o f the liquid distrib u tio n on the local B O D 5 rem o v al a series o f experim ents w ere conducted. F or this purpose, the reacto r w as ru n in co n tin u o u s m ode. A set o f the liquid collecting cells, located at a diagonal pathw ay, w as c hosen and the rate o f the liquid flow ing in these cells w as m easured. The sam e sam ples w ere fu rth er analyzed for their BOD5 and CO D contents. This experim ent w as perform ed using the single p o in t d istributor at three flow rates o f 0.184, 0.551 and 0.918 k g /m ^s. T he initial P G M E co ncentration o f 300 ppm was used for all runs.

T he resu lts are show n in Figures 4.31 to 4.33. The figures plot the percentage BOD5 re m o v e d and the liquid flow rate versus radial position at a given liquid flow rate. It can be seen that, sim ilar to the liquid distribution, the BO D rem oval w as n o t u n ifo n n o v er th e bed cross section. T he regions w ith higher liquid flow rates corresponded to the lo w er BOD5 rem o v al, w hile, the percentage BOD5 rem oval w as relatively high at the regions w ith lo w local flow rates. In other w ords, the percent o f BOD5 rem oved w as inversely p ro p o rtio n al to the local flow rate o f the w astew ater in the bed.

It is w ell k n o w n th a t for a given h eight o f the bed, the liquid retention tim e is an inverse fu n c tio n o f the liquid flow rate and decreases as the liquid flow rate increases. O n the o th e r h and, the b io dégradation is a slow process req u irin g a specific retention tim e o f the p o llu te d w ater in the bed.

Chapter 5 Conclusion
The following conclusion could be drawn from the thesis:

- -; 1

·

Liquid distribution affects the BOD 5 removal efficiency in trickle bed bioreactors greatly. Under the most uniform liquid distribution condition achieved in this study (with 1.4 m bed height, using multipoint distributor and 0.918 kg/m^.s liquid flow rate) about 85% of the BOD 5 could be removed by biological oxidation in a trickle bed bioreactor after 4 days o f treatment. Whereas, under poor liquid distribution condition with single point distributor and 0.7 m bed height at 0.184 kg/m2.s, only 65% o f the BOD 5 was removed.

·

The liquid distribution in the trickle bed bioreactor was not uniform. The uniformity o f the liquid distribution was found to be affected by the liquid flow rate, the liquid distributor design, and the height o f the hed.

The uniformity o f the liquid distribution affects the dynamic liquid holdup. Under more uniform liquid distribution condition, the liquid holdup was higher. Moreover, the growth of biofilm on the packing surface was found to affect the dynamic liquid holdup in the bed and increased the dynamic liquid holdup up to 32 % compare to that o f clean bed.

The biodégradation rate of the PGME in the trickle bed bioreactor followed first order reaction kinetics. The apparent biodégradation rate constant was found to be a function o f the liquid flow rate, the liquid distribution design, the packed bed height and the initial organic concentration. The apparent biodégradation rate constant increased from 0.0164 to 0.0212 1/hr with the increase o f the liquid flow

94

rate from 0.184 to 0.918 kg/m^.s. However, it decreased from 0.0134 to 0.0083

Chapter 6 Recommendation
Liquid flow rate and liquid distribution influences the biomass growth and sloughing. In the present study, it was assumed that the rate o f growth o f biomass and the rate of biomass sloughing was equal, and therefore, the biofilm thickness was constant. However, this is not true for the trickle bed bioreactot operating under high liquid flow rates since high liquid flow rates induce high shear stress that can cause higher sloughing o f the biofilm. It is recommended to investigate the effect o f biomass growth and sloughing on the trickle bed bioreactor performance and the BOD5 removal efficiency under continuous operation trickle bed bioreactor.

This experiment was carried out in a pilot plant trickle filter with relatively small diameter. The similar study should be done using a real scale trickle bed bioreactor under continuous operating conditions.

In the present study, effect of liquid distribution on the organic removal was studied through dynamic liquid holdup. The dynamic liquid holdup was used as a measure o f wetting efficiency under various liquid distribution conditions. For the further study, the direct measurement of wetting efficiency, instead o f measuring the dynamic liquid holdup, is recommended.

Appendix B
The uncertainty associated with calculated quantities such as B O D 5 and dynamic liquid hold up were estimated according to the method for the calculation o f uncertainty in a function o f several variables [ 1 1 1 ].

^

B.l.Uncertainty in liquid flow rate
The liquid flowing out of each cell o f the liquid collector, Vi was collected and measured in a graduated cylinder over time t. Then the liquid flow rate was calculated by the following equation;

The uncertainty in the volume o f the liquid was based on the graduation o f the graduated cylinder used. The smallest graduations of the 10, 25, 50 and 200 ml graduated cylinders were 0.2 ml (2%), 0.5 ml (2%), 2 ml (4%) and 2 ml (1%) respectively. The sample calculation is for 58 ml sample collected over 60 min at liquid flow rate o f 0.734 kg/m^.s.

5V, = 5 8 x 0 .0 1 = ±0.58 w/

The uncertainty associated in measuring the time, t was based on the smallest graduation o f the timer used. The timer had uncertainty o f 1 second. The uncertainty associated in measuring time was the combination o f the uncertainty in starting time and stopping time. The resulting error in time measurement was determined by a rootmean-square calculation:

The uncertainty associated in maldistribution coefficient value was the calculated based on the calculation o f uncertainty in a function o f several variables [111]. The maldistibution coefficient is given by the filoowing equation:

The uncertainty associated with dissolved oxygen measurements water
(

calculated from the manufacture's (YSl, Inc.) instructions. The individual sources of error are: 1. Instrument accuracy = ± 0.1% plus least significant figure 2. Probe background current error = background factor x (1-a/b) c, where a is the calibration value, b is the solubility o f oxygen in fresh water at 760 mm Hg and at the measured temperature, and c is the measured DO value. The background factor at 20°C is 1 %. 3. Probe nonlinearity = ± 0.3% of reading 4. The variation from nominal response to sample temperature is ± 0.2% o f DO reading per degree C o f the temperature difference between temperature of sample and the temperature at with the probe was calibrated.
