Abstract
Evaluating the Potential to Achieve Passive House with Structural Insulated Panels using a Case Study in Toronto, Canada Masters of Building Science, 2013 Loreta Brazukas, Ryerson University A home in Toronto recently re-constructed with Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) was analyzed and an energy simulation using HOT2000 and PHPP was created based on the current state of the house. The simulations were used to determine compliance with the Canadian R-2000 standard and the Passive House standard. The building met the R-2000 standard in its current state. Further analysis was required in order to determine design changes that may be made to achieve Passive House. This research determined the applicability of SIPs to achieve these standards in the context of the subject home. Through the redesign of the building enclosure assemblies and the elimination of the thermal bridges through the envelope, the Passive House standard was achieved using a double wall stud SIP. A number of design changes were also required including better performing windows and HRV as well as the addition of glazing to the south façade and removal of glazing on other facades. These design changes were then applied to HOT2000 and it was found that the Passive House building achieved an energy savings of 60% compared to the R-2000 standard baseline.

1. Introduction 1.1. Overview

Canada's residential housing stock was responsible for 16% of Canada's total energy consumption in 2007 (NRCan, 2010). There is an increasing concern regarding the reduction of energy use at the residential level. The new Ontario Building Code (including SB-10) and the National Energy Code of Canada are attempting to resolve some of these issues (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2011). One potential technology that has not been widely used that may contribute to the reduction in energy usage of residential homes is Structurally Insulated Panels (SIPs). The use of these panels in current construction practice is small and there is a need for more research to determine the benefits of using SIPs. The ability for residential construction to reach net Zero or Passive House standards is challenging with current construction practices in Canada's cold climate. In order to achieve low-energy performance goals in the future, there is a need to introduce new construction materials and building practices. The thermal envelope of buildings is the first step in determining overall energy efficiency improvements to the building particularly with new construction efforts. The mechanical and electrical loads of the building can be reduced when improving the building enclosure first. The building enclosure should maximize thermal resistance as well as minimize the amount of air leakage through the envelope and increase thermal comfort. While optimizing the building enclosure, one commonly overlooked and energy intensive component is the amount of air leakage through the building envelope. The most common issue with reducing the air leakage in the building is due to poor craftsmanship and imperfect materials. One way to improve this is to use prefabricated walls that are designed and manufactured to fit perfectly together. SIPs provide a very unique construction in the building wall assemblies. They consist of 3 layers of materials as a unit and are built consistently due to the controlled manufacturing process. They will typically

not allow any air movement within them which results in no convection occurring and so there are minimal condensation risks. The entire factory manufactured wall panel is airtight and leakage can only occur at the splines or other connections in the building. As SIPs are produced in a controlled environment at a factory they are typically more consistent than walls installed onsite (Christian 2006). SIPs can replace exterior walls and roof components to one pre-manufactured modular construction solution. This effect onsite is that one product is now being purchased and installed instead of many separate products: structural studs, insulation, oriented strandboard. SIPs have been shown to be easy to install and without much more effort can significantly increase the air tightness of a building envelope (Christian 2006). Obtaining Passive House certification requires an extremely tight envelope that is difficult to achieve with conventional construction practices. An EnerGuide for Houses residential housing audit found that across Canada the average air leakage rates for homes built as recently as 2005 (most recent data available) was 5 ACH at 50 Pa (Gamtessa, 2005). The majority of these homes were conventional wood stud framing. The requirement for Passive House Certification is 0.6 ACH at 50 Pa, which is a reduction in air leakage of 88%. The key benefit of using SIPs is that they are factory built and designed to fit together in an airtight way. They can be constructed easier and faster on site due to the fact that they have been pre-designed. They come pre-cut for the specific project. Also, due to the reduction in thermal bridging when using SIP products, the thermal comfort of the home increases. The research approach in order to optimize residential building construction included analyzing a building that has been re-constructed with SIPs and then reviewing potential improvements that can be made. The research included collecting actual data onsite and then developing various energy models. Energy models consisted of Passive House Planning Package software and HOT2000. The models included a comparison between the home with SIPs and redesigning the home in order to achieve Passive House certification.

The results will show the effectiveness of using SIP materials to aid in energy efficiency improvements of the home. The research will quantify the benefits of SIP construction in terms of annual energy savings and with respect to the Canadian R-2000 standard and the Passive House standard. 1.2. Objective

The objective of the research is to investigate the energy performance of Structural Insulated Panels through the analysis of a case study that was recently re-constructed with SIPs. The goal of the simulation will be to determine the potential energy improvements that would be required to achieve Passive House standard. The research questions that will be answered through this research are: · · · Can Structural Insulated Panels help in the achievement of Passive House? What specific minimum changes would be required to achieve Passive House standards for the case study home? How would the case study home (as designed to meet Passive House) then compare with average Canadian Homes and the R2000 standard? 1.3. Methodology

The methodology used in achieving the objective is as follows: 1. Research and understand current uses of structural insulated panels particularly in high performance buildings. 2. Review current market and uses of SIPs in Canada 3. Determine what materials are currently being used and which are available in the industry, with the goal of determining an optimum SIP 4. Case Study of SIP home in Toronto; a. Documentation review of drawings and design data b. Field measurements and data analysis including a site visit to the home,

c. Blower door testing, d. Thermography scan, e. Utility consolidation and analysis. 5. Analyze the thermal properties of SIPs, including thermal bridge analysis of potential areas of concern and determining how to minimize thermal bridging effects, if any. The details investigated in this report include wall corners, wall interface foundation walls to SIP, roof connections and floor. 6. Simulation using HOT2000 and PHPP 7. Determine changes required in order to achieve Passive House 8. Analyze the results and performance of the new design and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the SIP panel 1.4. Scope of Work and Limitations

The building that was analyzed is located in Toronto, Canada. The scope of this paper is to determine what type of SIPs could have been used for this building to achieve R-2000 and PH. The home was recently retrofitted by the owner with SIPs. The research will determine if the SIPs would be capable of achieving the stringent air tightness requirements of PH. The research was limited to the existing site location, orientation and floor plans.. Shading of the home was also analyzed in the Passive House model as this is a significant affect especially in the dense urban location of the home. The scope is limited to single family dwellings in Toronto climate. The scope of this report is to primarily examine the thermal properties of SIPs, although other properties such as durability, moisture management and constructability were considered. These other properties are not the main focus of the report and a thorough analysis on these items was not made at this time.

Impact of Research

This research will identify areas where structural insulated panels can be improved and where they can be used to potentially achieve Passive House Standards. The research will also be comparing the home for both the PHPP calculation methodology as well as the HOT2000 calculation methodology developed in Canada.

2. Literature Review 2.1. Current Construction Practices with SIPs

Structural Insulated Panels are being used more frequently in construction in Canada (Borjen, 2008). Modular buildings and modular building products such as SIPs in general have been gaining popularity in the market place as they are more time efficient and produce consistent results. In order to achieve standardization of these products there needs to be more direction from regulatory bodies. Currently, regulatory bodies have not approved all SIPs for use in Canada. SIPs require more engineering design to be approved then other structural wall systems. For load bearing applications solid lumber studs must be used and for roofs, I-joists or solid lumber studs have been approved (NRCan, 2001). The use of solid lumber splines is beneficial to the structural strength of the wall system but decreases thermal resistance of the wall overall. The development of standards for structural insulated panels in North America is still ongoing (Borjen, 2008). This is one of the fastest growing areas of building technology in housing construction (Borjen, 2008). The major reasons for this are the increased energy efficiency of SIP products as well as the ease and speed of construction. Many of the current manufacturers have proprietary designs and code reports. The basic elements of a prescriptive SIP standard have been included in the 2007 Supplement of the 2006 International Residential Code (IRC). A new ASTM standard will also be available for SIPs which would create a path for all manufacturers to ensure they meet the requirements of the US and Canadian Building Codes (SGC Horizon Building and Construction Group, 2012). These prescriptive measures have been limited to SIPs made with EPS cores and OSB facings. This now allows jurisdictions that have adopted this code an easier route to project approval by regulatory bodies. It seems that the main concern of regulatory bodies is structural behaviour of the panels themselves when loaded. To assist designers, design tables for a variety of SIPs are becoming available as a variety of SIPs have been tested.

Current and Past Research

The first occurrence of SIPs in the industry was in 1937 when the Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin assembled a demonstration house using "stress-skin panels" (Borjen, 2008). The use of SIPs has been slowly rising. In 2006 the amount of SIPs being used for the construction of new homes doubled from 1997 levels, with 1.8 million new homes in America (Borjen, 2008). There have been many studies showing that homes constructed using SIPs outperform traditional construction in terms of the thermal performance of the wall, comparing wood framed walls that achieve a thermal resistance of RSI-1.93 m2K/W walls with SIPs that are 114 mm thick (Krarti, 2006). The value of SIP construction is due to the reduction in thermal bridging and therefore the increase of the total thermal resistance of the wall when compared to wood framed homes. A 89 mm SIP wall has an effective thermal resistance of RSI 2.5 m2K/W whereas the same width of wall that has been wood framed has RSI 1.73 m2K/W (Christian, 1995). Habitat for Humanity has been using SIPs commonly in many of their new construction projects. A commonly cited case is the Near Zero Energy Home (ZEH) projects in Tennessee (Christian, 2006). All of the homes in this development have been built with SIPs among other energy efficient technologies and their energy use was closely monitored. There have been studies done by ORNL on the individual homes in the development providing suggestions for the next home to be built (Christian, 2006). In a comparison of four of the homes in which three of the homes were made with SIPs with an EPS core, the fourth one was made with SIPs that have a polyisocyanurate core. When comparing all of the homes to the base home that used standard two by four framed construction, the Building America benchmark house used 6512 kWh/year whereas the SIP home 4314 kwh/year (Christian 2006). The base home was the Building America Benchmark had 2x4 studs with fiberglass batt and OSB sheating and the roof had a thermal resistance of RSI-4.93 m2K/W due to the fiberglass blown insulation, whereas, the other home had SIPs that were 114 mm for the walls and 203 mm for the roof. There were some additional mechanical differences as well;

7

the air conditioner of the SIP home was smaller than the baseline and slightly more efficient (SEER 12 vs 13.7). The SIP home also had an integrated hot water heater as opposed to an electric home. The study did not provide information regarding the energy savings due to the SIPs alone. The design of the home surpassed the energy requirements of the benchmark house model by 50%. Habitat for Humanity also found that when building two homes side by side ­ one constructed with SIP walls and roof and other with conventional wood stud framing and fiberglass insulation, the volunteers had a preference to use SIPs on the job site. This was due to the fact volunteers had very limited construction knowledge but since the installation of SIPs was easy and straightforward, they enjoyed helping to build them and were able to do it quicker (Christian 2006, Mullens 2006). For the habitat for humanity projects, it was found that the home built with SIPs was able to save two-thirds of the site framing labour for the walls and the roof (Mullens, 2006). However the SIP project did require the use of a crane onsite. The use of a crane onsite may prohibit projects construction with SIPs in remote areas and constricted areas where it would be more expensive and difficult to use a crane. Volunteers for the Habitat homes were also interviewed and largely believed that the effort to build the SIP home was significantly less than the conventionally framed one (Mullens, 2006). The production of SIPs also occurs in a factory-controlled environment that ensures quality and consistency of the panels to a level that is difficult to achieve when trying to assemble a wall in the natural environment. In addition to this, due to the speed of construction the assembly is not exposed to environmental factors for the length of time that a conventionally framed home could be. Construction waste was also significantly reduced; half as much wood scrap was produced for the SIP homes (Mullens, 2006). Additional research into framing techniques is required to determine more specific advantages of SIPs (Mullens 2006). Lessons learned from past ZEH built by Habitat for Humanity were recognized in future ZEH. ZEH5 was built with SIPs as well but the cathedral ceiling used SIPs which were 203 mm thick and had I-joist splines and an additional 50 mm of XPS outboard of the panel (ORNL, 2008)

8

There were many energy efficiency upgrades to achieve this savings but the use of SIPs was a major factor as the airtight and well-insulated home was able to downsize all mechanical equipment and make full use of the geothermal heat pump system. The study did not analyze the contributing factors to the energy savings individually. There is more research required to determine the exact effect that SIPs may have had on these energy savings. Another study analyzed the energy consumption of a near zero energy home built in Utah over the period of one year. A parametric analysis showed that SIPs alone were responsible for 30% energy reduction in the home due to the increased insulation and airtightness of the home (Jannumahanthi, 2010). This study simulated a building using EnergyPlus and parametrically analyzed a variety of wall constructions; the building was constructed with 6" SIP external walls and 8"SIP roof (Jannumahanthi, 2010). Many of the studies in current literature discuss the structural elements of the panels (Mousa, 2010, Taylor, 1997, Sennah, 2008). There are structural concerns associated with the use of SIPs, namely potential creep and debonding of the OSB on the panels themselves. There has been several failure mechanisms experienced with SIPs including debonding, buckling, wrinkling, core failure, flexural creep deflection. The use of SIPs in climates that are moisture sensitive or flood prone areas is not recommended (Vaidya, 2010). Studies have been conducted on newer SIPs for these areas that have thermoplastic composite facesheets that provide more structure (Vaidya, 2010) where OSB facesheets have failed. There is some research devoted to the material selection used for SIP manufacturing, in order to greatly improve the product. Some of this research is being focused on lowering the density of boards to improve the stiffness to weight ratio (Kawasaki, 2006). However, to ensure proper moisture management within the boards it is important that the boards have a higher density then the insulation between them (Lstiburek, 2008).

2.3.

Current Market

There are a growing number of SIP manufactures in Canada. SIPs have been used in Canada in some capacity since the 1950s. Habitat for Humanity also commonly uses them in construction due to the ease of installation and the overall time savings on the site. Habitat for Humanity also tracks energy consumption for many of their buildings and they have seen a 50% annual energy use reduction in these homes with SIPs relative to the rest of their portfolio (Christian 2006). The manufacturers of SIP panels are testing them regularly for compliance with Canadian Construction Materials Center (CCMC). There are many new types of SIPs available on the market today with different materials and connections. The introduction of the use of SIPs in residential construction has been slow but growing. Prestige Panel is introducing newer panels using polyisocyanurate and magnesium oxide panels (Prestige Panel, 2011). The Endeavour Center is also providing SIPs made out of strawbale and plywood (Endeavour Center, 2011). These newer products will need time to penetrate the market. Contractors in Canada have been regularly building with SIPs for the past 20 years. The most common insulation material is EPS although polyisocyanurate is frequently used by the manufactures to increase their sales. SIPs can be more cost effective than spray foam that has been foamed on site as it may be mass. They are also more consistent as there is minimal variation in density of the insulation as it is manufactured in a factory setting. There are two main types of SIPs for construction. One type is panels that have been precut such as Plastifab (Plastifab, 2011) which come exactly as designed for the particular building. The other type is panels such as Thermapan (Thermapan, 2011) which are factory manufactured to be of the same size so they are always in stock and therefore are more accessible. This type of panel requires more work on site as they have to be measured and cut and installed directly on site. Some contractors do prefer panels that are cut to size onsite as it also allows the constructors of the building more flexibility in adjusting the design to meet the site conditions when there is an unexpected issue on site that was not designed for. Although this provides for more flexibility with the use of the panels, it can also cause workmanship error. The main issue for SIP acceptance by

10

regulatory bodies is a structural one, however, fire safety concerns also exist with EPS panels as EPS turns to liquid and then gas when heated. The use of SIPs typically requires cranes which might deter home owners from using them. 2.4. Summary

Although SIPs are being used more prevalently in North America, there is a need for additional research to determine the specific energy savings potential that may be attributed to SIPs. This may increase the use of SIPs in the marketplace in the future. Passive House certification has been achieved with SIPs although minimal research is available for assessing SIPs for Passive House certification. There is also a need to streamline the regulatory process for SIP designs from regulatory bodies in order to gain a wider acceptance of this technology. As the building codes get more stringent and focused on energy efficiency measures, SIPs will likely be used even more.

3. Case Study: Description of Baseline Conditions 3.1. Site Observations

The case study is based on a single family detached two-storey household located in downtown east Toronto. A young couple with a child is currently occupying the building.

Figure 1: Location of Case Study Home

The home is located in a dense urban environment. The building is shaded by other homes on the north and south facades. General weather data for the City of Toronto was used for all simulations. The building was recently completely rebuilt with SIP walls and roof, new windows and doors were installed, all mechanical equipment was also updated in the building.

13

3.1.1. Building Enclosure The panels that were selected for the case study building discussed in this report are from Plastifab (aka Insulspan) because the homeowner recognized them as one of the major Canadian SIP manufacturers and they were interested to be involved with research (Gray, 2011). These panels came predesigned for this specific building, as it was a retrofit so the exact type of panels required was known. Pastifab was also able to provide the homeowner with engineer stamped drawings, which made the building code approval process more streamlined (Gray, 2011). The shell of the case study home was completely assembled in a single week (Gray, 2011). The first floor only took a day to assemble and the second floor and roof took the rest of the week that included some trouble scheduling due to inclement weather (Gray, 2011). The number of labour hours required to install the SIPs was a solid week with two people working full-time. The roof panels were more challenging to install than the wall panels as they are larger in size and more difficult to erect. The design process with the manufacturer occurred over a month before the design was finalized and the panels were delivered 5 weeks later (Gray, 2011). The homeowner was also able to install all of the panels by himself being without a strong background in construction (Gray, 2011). This is encouraging to ensure that this type of construction becomes more widespread in the residential building industry. The construction of the main wall assemblies is Structural Insulated Panels (SIP) as manufactured by Insulspan. All detailed information for the SIPs was taken directly from the Insulspan drawings for the case study home (July 2010) and technical SIP details (Insulspan, 2013). First and second floor walls are 165 mm panels. The roof consists of a 260 mm panel. The panels comprised two sheets of 13.5 mm OSB on either side of expanded polystyrene. The splines for the building were single pieces of lumber, whereas the splines of the roof assembly were double pieces of lumber. All of the SIP details have been included in Appendix C (Insulspan, 2013). The panels including the spline were

14

modeled in THERM and PHPP and the thermal resistance determined was included in the HOT2000 model. The effective thermal resistance from the PHPP model of the walls was RSI-4.31 W/m2K and the main roof was RSI-6.83 W/m2K.

Basement walls are generally 203.2 mm concrete block from footings to grade (approximately 1.22 m), then 203.2 mm of poured concrete above for approximately 600 mm utilized to increase the previously existing height of the basement. There is 50 mm of spray foam on the basement walls and 88.9 mm in the header space. The back part of the basement extends beyond the rest of the house. The ceiling space in this back part of the basement is insulated with 127 mm of spray foam. The basement floor consists of four inches of existing concrete slab with 76.2 mm of EPS underneath it. There is no additional insulation to create a thermal break between the basement wall and the basement floor. However, the floor and the wall slabs of concrete do not touch, as there is only 10 mm gap with dimpleboard. The drawings of the home have been included in Appendix A. All of the windows are double glazed with an argon fill and composite frames (fiberglass and wood). There are two glass patio doors at the back of the building on is on the ground floor and the other at the second floor balcony with the same glazing properties as the windows. The window and patio door manufacturer is Marvin Windows and Doors under their "Integrity" brand. The specifications can be found in the Wood-Ultrex catalog (Marvin, 2009). The front door is manufactured by Thermatru Doors and is the Fiber-Classic Oak 2100 is Aluminum clad exterior, wood textured fiberglass with an English walnut stain and a polyurethane foam core. The door is Energy Star rated and has a thermal resistance of RSI 2.73 Km2/W. The skylight is made by Velux and is Energy Star rated. It's their hand-cranked operable model. The glazing for the skylight is also an insulted double pane unit with argon gas fill as indicated in the window schedule. There was also a roof hatch that was marked "Lexcan" and is 76 mm by 76 mm. It has been sealed off by the building owner and as such excluded from the energy analysis.

The light fixture in the second floor corridor is seldom used as there is a skylight located directly above that space that fully illuminates the entire area. The value included in the energy model for these lighting fixtures assumed a daily use of 3 hours for all fixtures. The daily light use average used was back-calculated from the lighting survey done at the home and the default assumptions that were made for determining compliance with the R-2000 standard. The lighting assumptions do not affect the total energy use of the HOT-2000 model by a significant amount. If the lighting assumed is halved then the total energy for the building changes by 0.76%. The same lighting assumptions were then used in the Passive House model.

3.1.3. Plumbing Fixtures There are two washrooms located in the home. The washroom in the basement contains one toilet, which consumes 6 liters of water per flush, and one faucet, which consumes 8.3 liters of water per minute. The main washroom is located on the second floor of the home and contains one toilet fixture, which consumes 6 litres per flush, two lavatory faucets which consume 8.3 liters per minute and one showerhead which consumes 9.5 liters per minute. 3.1.4. Equipment and Appliances The home is heated by a furnace that is manufactured by Carrier (Performance 96, model: 58UVB060-14). It has a total heating capacity of 60,000 BTU/h and a thermal efficiency of 95% (Energy Star, 2013). A Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) provides ventilation air for the home. The HRV is manufactured by Carrier (model HRV CCSV) the specification sheet for the product is located in Appendix A. This product has been certified by the Heating Ventilation Institute. The unit can be balanced to supply 3 to 48 L/s to the home. Based on the mechanical drawings, it provides 46 L/s, the same exhaust rate was assumed to maintain balance. The energy recovery efficiency of the HRV in cooling mode was estimated to be 25%, however the owners seldom use the HRV during summer as natural ventilation is preferred when available. It is not in use during the shoulder seasons when only natural ventilation is being used in the home through operable windows. The HRV is set to low when the air conditioning is on in the summer months (when the temperature is greater than 25oC). This was included in the simulation as temperature controlled ventilation. There are two other exhaust fans that were included in the simulation, a bathroom fan (Broan 684N with a capacity of 42.4 L/s) and the kitchen fan (Broan 650 with a capacity of 23.6 L/s). The laundry exhaust was not installed at the time of the audit and as such was not included in the model.

The domestic hot water is heated by a 151 liter Superflue (model: 8G4ONVH-ES-02) at a slightly lower temperature than for which it is designed. The natural gas heater is capable of providing 33,000 Btu/hr and is rated at 113 L/hr at 55oC. The Energy Factor of this unit is 0.67 as provided by the manufacturer (JohnWood, 2013). The residents seldom use the air conditioning unit, as all of the windows are operable. The unit installed is the Carrier Air Conditioning Comfort 16 puron AC with an EER of 13.00 and a SEER of 16.0. The total cooling capacity of the unit is 18,000 Btu/h. The kitchen contains a microwave with a built in recirculating range hood over the stove. The microwave is a Samsung (model: SMH9107). The stove itself is Energy Star certified and is rated to consume 565 kWh/year. The refrigerator is also Energy Star certified and is rated to consume 445 kWh/year. The clothes washer is located on the second floor of the home and is a Kenmore Ecocycle. There is no drier in the home. 3.2. Air Infiltration

A depressurization test was conducted using a blower door to determine the air tightness of the home. The test was conducted in accordance with CAN/CGSB-149.10-M86,

Determination of the airtightness of building envelopes by the fan depressurization method. It was found to be 0.727 ACH at 50 Pa. At the end of the test the blower was used to maximize a pressure differential in the home and a walkthrough of the entire house was completed. Common areas of leakage were investigated during the test. The areas of air leakage that were identified during this test included: · · · · · Crack in concrete in basement washroom Basement header where the ground floor intersects Weather stripping at patio door at rear of home Electrical outlet beside exterior door Electrical fixture box in both of the second floor bedrooms

19

The results of the blower door tested were entered directly into the HOT2000 model during the test. 3.3. Thermographic Scan

An infrared thermographic scan was conducted for the building to determine any other significant areas of thermal bridging. The exterior scan of the building occurred on the evening of March 7, 2012 in order to establish a significant temperature difference between the interior and the exterior of the building. The interior of the building was maintained at 22oC whereas the exterior was 4oC providing a temperature difference of 18oC. A minimum temperature difference of 10oC is required in order to see the effects of thermal bridging and air leakage.

Figure 3: Exterior thermographic scan of east (rear) elevation

Figure 5 indicates that the temperature difference at the surface of the center of the wall panel and the spline only 1oC, this narrow temperature difference ensures that the entire surface of the wall only experiences slight fluctuations.

20

Figure 4: Exterior thermal scan of wall and roof connection

The temperature difference between the wall panel and the roof connection is 5oC. This temperature difference is slightly more than the temperature difference of the splines in the wall panels. These are areas of the wall assembly where solid lumber intersects the insulation plane. The value of the thermographic scans allowed us to identify where potential thermal bridges may be located throughout the home. The potential thermal bridges that were located and discussed such as the roof/wall connection and the splines were modeled later modeled in THERM to calculate the psi factor. The thermographic scan did not reveal any areas of potential air leakage, which often occurs near the window frames and other penetrations. The analysis of the infrared images reveals that the only thermal bridging occurs near the splines of the panels and connections with the roof. The temperature difference between the center of the SIP and the spline appears to only be a one to two degree difference at most, which is a small difference overall.

4. Case Study Simulations 4.1. HOT2000

4.1.1. HOT2000 Software The R-2000 standard governed by the Natural Resource Canada's Office of Energy Efficiency promotes the use of cost effective and energy efficient building practices and technologies (NRCan, 2010). HOT2000 Software is provided by NRCan to evaluate compliance with the R-2000 standard (NRCan, 2010). The software provides a simple platform to analyze the annual consumption end uses of a residential home. Since the software is designed to be easy to use with many defaults for the R-2000 program, it does not provide a lot of flexibility for the types of inputs. 4.1.2. HOT2000 Simulations The Case Study home was modeled in HOT2000 using both General mode and R-2000 mode. All of the building areas were take from the drawings located in Appendix A. The thermal resistance of the building enclosure was entered as a user specified value. The windows were modeled in HOT2000 using the default material library. The floor headers were modeled in the THERM as defined in Insulspan drawings for the case study home (dated July, 2010). The 2nd floor plate is actually hung inside the walls. This location of the thermal envelope was analyzed to determine if there was a thermal bridge. The temperature gradient across the header is shown below.

Figure 5: Second floor header

The Utility Rates for the building were provided and used to calibrate the energy model. 4.1.3. HOT2000 Results and Discussion The R-2000 Standard is based on the Space Heating and Hot Water Energy for the building. The home uses approximately 10,590 kWh for space heating and domestic hot water in an average year. The R-2000 reference building would use 15,100 kWh per year. Therefore, the building was found to be 30% above the R-2000 target. The R-2000 Report for this building is found in Appendix D. The end use breakdown of the simulation is shown in Figure 6.

24

HRV& Fans A/C 1% 3% Lights and Appliances 28%

Space Heating 45%

DHW 23%

Figure 6: HOT2000 building end use breakdown

From the end use table, it is apparent that the majority of the energy used in the home is space heating as well as lighting. The national average residential home energy end use distribution is located in the following Table.
Table 2: Energy End Use Distribution

National Average Space Heating Water Heating Appliances Lighting Space Cooling 66.20% 15.41 % 12.06% 4.37% 1.97%

HOT2000 Simulation 45% 23% 28% <1%

The data in the table for national average end uses is from the NRCan Survey of Household Enegy Use. The Case Study is consuming a smaller portion of the total energy for space heating when compared to the average. As such, the domestic hot water, lighting and appliances are consuming more. The space heating percentage of the building is lower than n the national average because of the increased thermal resistance of the building

25

envelope components, minimized infiltration, heat recovery of ventilation air and has a very efficient furnace the space heating. The result of the reduction in the space heating component has cause the appliance and lighting percentage to increase. The air conditioner is on roughly 600 hours for this case study home. This is the amount o f time that the temperature in Toronto reaches beyond 25oC. The air conditioning unit as described in the previous section has a capacity of 18,000 Btu and a SEER of 16. The total demand of the unit is 1,125 W, it is also a two stage unit. Assuming the second stage is required when the outdoor air temperature was over 30oC. which would mean the energy consumption of the unit over the year is a maximum of 250 kWh. The total energy for the building was 13,964 ekWh, therefore the maximum air conditioning percentage would be 1.8% of the total. The cooling load for the building can also be estimated by reviewing the electrical load for the building. Figure 7 represents the monthly kWh consumption for the building, as can be seen from the Figure the base load of the building is approximately 325 kWh/month. The electricity consumption does increase in the summer months for a total of 175 kWh. This value is less than the previously calculated maximum value of 250 kWh. The assumed 175 kWh of cooling would represent 1.2% of the total annual building energy consumption.

The natural gas consumption for the year 2012 the HOT2000 energy simulation was within 8% of the simulated value for the previous year. For electrical consumption was within 2%

28

of the simulation. The simulation was however calibrated with the utility bills. The building was completed rebuilt in 2010 and as can be seen in Figure 7 the natural gas consumption reduced dramatically. The electrical consumption has remained steady throughout the years. The lighting in the building is mainly incandescent and the lighting power densities in all of the spaces of the home could be decreased with more efficient fixtures. If all of the fixtures were updated to similar LED type fixtures, the lighting demand savings would be 75%. This would mean the overall energy savings of 12% for the home. The domestic hot water portion of the energy use is also high, although the water heater is very efficient compared to potential alternatives. The hot water flow fixtures (shower, lavatory) are not low-flow industry standard fixtures but have very typical building code rates. A low flow showerhead and lavatories would help decrease the energy use of this area. The space heating is the greatest energy end use for this building. The space heating system is an energy efficient system and as such the energy use is primarily due to the thermal envelope. The thermal envelope will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter of this report. The greatest energy end use is space heating (45% of total energy). There are two sources of heating in this building: the furnace and the HRV. Although the simulation output does not indicate what fraction of heat could be captured by the HRV and the amount of supplemental heating that was required from the furnace. 4.2. Linear Thermal Bridge Analysis

4.2.1. THERM Software THERM is a two dimensional heat flow software tool developed by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratories. It is also the tool that is used by the National Fenestration Rating Council to determine thermal transmittance of glazing systems. The thermal bridge calculations in this section have been done in accordance with the requirements to achieve Passive House Certification (PHPP, 2007). A thermal bridge is

29

defined as a location in the building enclosure where the linear thermal bridge heat loss coefficient is greater than 0.01 W/mK (PHPP, 2007). THERM is used to determine the overall thermal transmittance through the section and PHPP software is used for individual components. 4.2.2. Thermal Bridge Simulations The Passive House Planning Package (2007) requires the consideration of any thermal bridges that have a great thermal bridge heat loss coefficient. The thermal bridge coefficient is a one-dimensional coefficient determined by a two-dimensional heat flow calculation determined by the difference in heat flow through each of the two contributing members. A thermal bridge occurs where the insulation is not continuous; these are often transition areas from one assembly to another. These areas of the building that require further modeling in THERM in order to be accounted for in PHPP. The following table summarizes the Thermal Bridges that were included in the PHPP calculation. They were modeled in PHPP as well as in THERM to determine the linear thermal bridge heat loss coefficient, any element with a coefficient less than 0.01 W/mK has to be included in the PHPP calculation sheet. There were four areas of concern identified in the case study home: the basement wall connection to the basement floor, corners between two wall panels, the connection of the wall to the roof and the second floor of the building. In order to calculate the results in the table above the following boundary conditions were used as described by PHPP 2007: Exterior Rainscreen: -16.3oC, 12.5 W/m2K Interior Corner: 20oC, 5 W/m2K Interior Wall: 20oC, 8.33 W/m2K Interior Ceiling: 20oC, 9.09 W/m2K Interior Floor: 20oC, 5.88 W/m2K Ground: 5oC, 1000 W/m2K (infinite) Adiabatic ­ default in THERM

30

All results had an error of less than 5% and 20 iterations; U-value tags were applied to the interior of the building envelope components. The interior temperature was assumed to be 20oC for the model as required by PHPP. The resulting linear thermal bridge heat loss coefficients Thermal Bridge Type Basement wall to basement Perimeter floor connection Corner Ambient Roof and Wall Connection Perimeter nd 2 floor Perimeter summarized in the following Table.
Table 3: Potential Thermal Bridges

are Thermal Bridge Description Calculated PSI factor (W/mK) - 0.335 0.129 0.103 0.064

The results of the thermal bridging analysis indicate that the individual components of the building are constructed in such a way that there are no thermal bridges. The thermal bridge at the second floor of the house is not considered a thermal bridge by PHPP standards because the total thermal conductance of the member is not that different from the thermal conductance of the individual members. However, it is the closest to a thermal bridge when compared to the rest of the potential thermal bridge areas. This was considered to be a thermal bridge in the case of the PHPP design of the home as the floor board had a greater affect on the total thermal conductance of that area.

31

Figure 10: Thermal Analysis at Foundation

Figure 11: Thermal Analysis at Foundation

The example shown in Figure 7 and 8 is the THERM simulation of the basement wall and foundation. This would appear to be a thermal bridge from Figure 7 as there is no thermal break between the wall and the floor except for a 10 mm space for dimpleboard. However, due to the thermal resistance of both the wall and the floor, there is not enough of a different between the individual thermal resistances of the assemblies and the total thermal resistance to be considered a thermal bridge. If the thermal resistance of either of

32

these elements were increased then the likelihood of a thermal bridge in this location would be greater. 4.3. Passive House Planning Package

4.3.1. Passive House Planning Package Software The Passive House Planning Package software that was used for this simulation was released by the Passive House Institute in 2007 (PHPP 2007). A more current version of the standard has been released by the Passive House Insitute in 2012; however, the new software was not available at the time of this analysis. It is a Microsoft Excel based calculation program. This is a design approach that has been used successfully in Germany since the 1990s (PHPP 2007). The requirements for a Passive House are to create a space that requires so little heating that it can be provided by the ventilation air alone with the use of a HRV. The goal is to only distribute fresh air throughout the home reducing fan energy. The super-insulated building envelope will prevent heat loss. Additionally, an extremely tight envelope will prevent infiltration of cold air and thus further reducing the heating load. The shape and orientation of the building are also designed to maximize solar gains to reduce the heat load within the building. The focus of Passive House is the reduction in the heating energy, which is the largest energy demand end use in colder climates such as Toronto. The intent of the Passive House is first to optimize the building envelope to reduce energy loses through the envelope. The goal is to supply the entire heating requirement using only the ventilation system. The intent is to not need a mechanical heating system at all, however, many Passive Houses still have some supplemental heating systems for extreme weather cases. Exhaust air leaving the building transfers energy to outdoor air entering the building thus minimizing additional heating requirements. In the Canadian climate, additional heating through the use of a mechanical system is necessary. There is a Passive House requirement for cooling and to ensure the building is not being overheated.

33

The specific criteria that are required in order to achieve the Passive House Certification is that the specific space heating demand of a building must be less than 15 kWh/m2yr, the house must achieve a tested air tightness of 0.6 ACH at 50 Pa and the entire specific primary energy demand must be less than 120 kWh/m2year which includes domestic electricity estimates (PHPP 2007). Cooling energy is also considered in the certification process however the certification of the house typically does not depend on it. 4.3.2. Passive House Planning Package Results and Discussion Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) version 2007 was used for the calculations. The specific heating demand for the case study home was investigated. The following worksheets were completed in PHPP: verification, climate, areas, refdims, r-values, ground, windows, shading, winentry, wintype, ventilation. The baseline building model was located in Toronto, Ontario.

Table 4: PHPP Default Assumptions

PHPP Assumption 20 76W Internal heat sources = 2.1 W/m2 Occupancy 35m2/person 1 DHW = 25 L/person/day 25 3 3 Airflow 2030m /hr = 17.65 cfm 20-30 m /hr/person, ACH=0.3 0.3 = 57 cfm Layout Temperature Temperature = 20oC

Actual Case Study Winter = 20, summer = 25 2.5 people 95 cfm 85 cfm

The calculation method used for this project was the monthly method as the annual heating load was higher than 8 kWh/m2 per year. The PHPP defaults were not used in the model where the actual case study values were known. The goal of the simulation was to determine the performance of home relative to the PHPP standard.

34

The assumptions that were made in the HOT2000 model as described in Section 3 were also included in the PHPP calculation.

The results of the analysis indicate: Specific annual space heat demand = 117 kWh/m2yr Air leakage test results 0.7 h-1 Specific primary energy demand = 219 kWh/m2yr Space heating load = 40 kWh/m2hr

The building in its current configuration as described above did not meet the Passive House standard. A significant effect of the specific space heating demand was the fact that the south and north façade had minimal glazing which was also shaded by adjacent buildings. The next step of the analysis was to determine the energy measures required in order to achieve Passive House certification, which requires a specific space heat demand of 15 kW/m2yr. The details of this redesign follow in Section 5.

5. Analysis of SIPs There are many different combinations of SIPs that can contribute to the improvement of current wall assemblies and practices. This section will look at different materials for the insulation and structural boards of the panels as well as the thermal bridges. The new design of the SIPs for the PHPP model will aim to eliminate thermal bridges completely from building envelope construction. 5.1. Material Selection

There are many different types of materials that SIPs can be manufactured with as will be discussed in this Section. The insulation for SIPs has to be carefully selected for increased structural performance and it needs to adhere well to the structural boards of the panels. In order to select the most appropriate materials the goal of maximizing thermal performance while decreasing the width of the panel to maintain its structure. The following table lists the different types of insulation (values taken from NRCan) that can be considered for SIPs (NRCan).

Expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam was used in the current construction of the SIP panel for the case study home. It is also the most commonly used insulation in SIPs that are available in the current market. EPS has been used in the market for over 50 years, it is widely available, easy to modify onsite and not as expensive as some of the newer materials.

The most natural and the least carbon content of the materials listed above is the strawbale SIP that would be the best material from a sustainability perspective. However, since this project is located in a dense Toronto neighborhood, the thickness of the panel will be need to be minimized in order to maximize interior space. SIPs made with strawbales are currently being manufactured in Canada. They comprise typical-use plywood skins and they need plaster to provide support which is typically 1" thick (Chris Magwood, 2013) and can achieve R30-R40 for a typical strawbale 14" thick. Unfortunately, due to the weight of the strawbales they can only be used as walls and are too heavy for roofing. It is the most sustainable of all of the materials considered as it has extremely low embodied energy. It is a waste product of the agricultural industry and requires very little processing, only needing some mechanical energy to form the straw into bales (Bronsema, 2010). It is also very abundant locally (southern Ontario). The construction is all natural without the use of any manufactured chemicals. Straw properties are 133 kg/m3 and 0.061 W/mK, more permeable plasters are recommended for moisture drying potential. Solar absorptance of earth plaster is greater than the solar absorptance of cement plaster, since the main goal is to reduce the heating load of the home, earth plaster would be favoured. It has been found that the earth plaster wall performed better than the cement plaster one, however the strawbales should be rain-sheltered due to potential moisture damage from rain events (Bronsema 2010). One of the major benefits of using strawbale SIPs is that they maybe designed with virtually no splines, this means that there is absolutely no thermal bridging between each panel. This is also due to the thickness required for them. For the

37

requirements of this project and the achievement of Passive House, the strawbale wall that would be required would be around 50 inches (4 feet) thick which is not feasible for the location.

Figure 12: Strawbale SIP production (Chris Magwood, 2013)

Phase Change Materials (PCM) have also been used in the design of newer SIPs. A SIP containing 20% PCM was able to reduce the peak heat flux reductions by 62% and the average additional reduction in heat transfer was 38% (Medina, 2007). The addition of a PCM to the SIP would allow the wall to attain a better thermal capacity than a conventional SIP as more energy can be stored and released through the PCM. This allows for the effect of a trombe wall without the massive size a trombe wall would need. This would be more ideal for a denser environment such as in the City of Toronto. This passive technique would also increase thermal comfort and reduce peak capacities of mechanical equipment. PCMs have been incorporated into wall boards and construction blocks in the past, the best performing wall board contained 25-30% PCM by weight (Medina, 2007). Basically a PCM pipe is inserted throughout the insulation material of the SIP.

38

Figure 13: PCM SIP cross section (Medina 2007)

A 1hr shift in peak flux was observed in a wall with 20% PCM compared to one without (Medina, 2007).

Figure 14: Wall heat fluxes for SIP and SIP containing 20% PCM (Medina 2007)

39

In testing onsite there was a perceived difference created by the PCM in the SIP, however, this technology is very new and not well tested. This could be an area of research that may be investigated in greater detail in the future, however there was not enough data to include this technology for the purposes of this report.

In addition to the insulated material there are many materials that can be used for the outer panels of a SIP. The current home has OSB outer boards that are the most common along with plywood boards. Newer materials that are being used in the construction of SIPs include cement bonded particle board, insulative sheathing, sheet rock, concrete, sheet metal, magnesium oxide boards, fiber-reinforced plastic. Some of these products have a much greater insulative properties that reduce the condensation potential of the boards, which is especially important on the exterior side of the panel where condensation may occur.

The requirement for the thickness of boards is indicated by the structural integrity of the overall SIP. In order to maximize the thermal properties of the entire panel, the insulation should be maximized whereas as the board that has a higher thermal conductance would need to be minimized. Since the structural integrity of the boards is not analyzed in this report, only the thermal conductivities of the different materials will be considered. Insulated Concrete Forms (ICF) were not considered for this analysis as they have a larger carbon footprint then using more natural materials such as wood frame construction, also since this is a residential project they would be too expensive for the size of the project. ICFs are very similar to SIPs in that they have a structural component at both ends and insulation in the center. They are considered by some to be the next generation of SIPs. They are structurally stronger than SIPs and as such used in buildings that are greater than

40

2 storeys. SIPs are re not recommended for taller buildings and as such they are not commonly used in the commercial sector. Modular and prefabricated wall assemblies should be strong enough to resist loads not only during the life of the building but throughout transportati transportation on and installation, the structural experiments confirm the use of this composite wall sy system stem in the residential market. Magnesium oxide board used in SIP construction has one of the lowest thermal conductivities of all of the outer boards considered of 0.047 W/mK, compared to OSB which has a thermal conductivity that is almost double this at 0.104 W/mK (Manalo. 2013). 2013)

Figure 15: : Wall cross section of a staggered double stud wall by (Raycore 2013) )

The double stud wall was modeled in contrast to a double SIP wall, similar to one used in the Equilibrium House design, which was a double layer of prefabricated Emercor SIPs. The second SIP panel does not have a second OSB layer but building paper that was installed onsite using cantilever er screws (CMHC 2010):

41

Figure 16: Double stud wall cross section (CMHC 2010)

Cross section of double SIP wall showing roof and second floor connections (CMHC 2010). The particular second floor assembly shown above is a thermal bridge this area and this is typically the hardest to remove a thermal bridge from as will be discussed in the thermal bridge section. The double SIP wall significantly reduced the energy consumption of the home, however the builder found the construction of the home challenging, the outside panels were slightly warped by the time the builder was ready to install them and did not fit perfectly together (CMHC 2010).
Table 6: Annual Heating Requirements for various wall types (CMHC 2010)

42

As a result of this CMHC study, a double SIP manufactured panel was analyzed for the purposes of this report. A manufactured double SIP wall would have the same insulative properties but would require less assembly onsite and less potential for warping. For the purposes of this report a manufactured with double stud walls, polyisocyanurate and MgO panels will be used in the design of the wall and roof assembly. 5.2. Thermal Bridges

SIP construction minimizes thermal bridging; however it is important to note that detailed construction drawings are required to ensure thermal bridges are minimized at every point of connection. The following section will look at options for minimizing thermal bridges at all panel to panel connection points including: splines, corners, walls to foundation, floor joists, and roof connections. The Passive House design will require building envelope assemblies that are much thicker and have higher thermal resistance, thermal bridging will be a greater affect for these assemblies then in the case study home. The splines are the most recurring potential thermal bridge connection within SIP construction as they are the most prevalent throughout the building and affect the thermal resistance of the whole wall of the SIP. There are many different materials that are available to reduce the thermal bridging at the splines. The use of fiber-reinforced plastics, insulating lumber other types of mechanical locks between panels have helped to reduce the amount of thermal bridging that occurs due to splines. The case study building uses regular 2x4 lumber for the splines. The use of the solid lumber was required due to Canadian structural regulations (NRCan, 2001). However, Insulspan offers a different type of spline that would have been is more effective at reducing the thermal bridging between panels. This is calculated in the following Table.

The solid lumber spline has a calculated thermal bridge heat loss coefficient value of 0.025 W/mK which would be considered a thermal bridge by PHPP standard. The OSB spline has a calculated psi factor 0.009 W/mK which would not be considered a thermal bridge by PHPP standards. Although the OSB Spline offered by Insulspan, it does not meet Canadian Structural requirement The first spline in the Table above was the one that was installed in the case study home, the second is another option that was available for the home. All panels from Insulspan are available in these two options. These are the two most common splines that can be designed with SIPs and are also available with other common manufacturers. As seen in the Table above the OSB spline reduces the amount of thermal distortion and is consequently a higher overall RSI value. The goal of the new design would be to completely reduce thermal bridging this would include not using lumber across the entire panel. The thermal resistance requirements for PHPP would also require a wall size that was much greater than the current walls size. Since this wall size would be so much greater there are more options with respect to the configurations of the splines. Three different types of configurations of studs were compared to determine the best one. Two types of double stud walls were compared. The double stud walls included one with offset studs and one with studs that were inline with each other. The third type of wall that was analyzed was designed with I-joist studs. The use of I-joist studs is also a common practice in Passive House constructions. The thickness of the wall was determined by the wall Rvalue requirements for the achievement of Passive House. The result of the thermal analysis for these walls is shown in the following table.

The Table above includes the thermal resistance values calculated for each of the three wall types. All three of the walls were the exact same thickness (280 mm) and the same materials. The only difference between each of the wall types is the type of connection between the two structural panels. The thermal resistance is the greatest in the wall type with offset wooden studs. Further thermal simulations were completed to determine the thermal bridging locations at building assembly interfaces. The details of all of the current areas of thermal bridging in the building were examined. The thermal bridges were calculated according to the linear thermal bridge coefficient (psi factor) calculation as outlined by the Passive House Institute (PHPP, 2007).
Table 9: Potential Thermal Bridge Simulations

Corner of Case Study home, linear thermal bridge heat loss coefficient was calculated to be -0.129 W/mK.

Corner of new PHPP, linear thermal bridge heat loss coefficient was calculated to be -0.008 W/mK.

47

Foundation of Case Study, linear thermal bridge heat loss coefficient was calculated to be ­ 0.336 W/mK.

Foundation of new Passive House, linear thermal bridge heat loss coefficient was calculated to be ­ 0.139 W/mK.

48

The analysis indicated in the Table above was completed for all of the identified potential locations where thermal bridging may occur in both case study and new Passive House designs. The results indicate that all of the thermal bridge coefficients are less than 0.01 W/mK and as such indicate that these are not actual thermal bridges. The thermal bridge is worse in the Passive House design of the building as opposed to the Case Study due to the increase in thermal resistance of the all assemblies that the Passive House design requires. The thermal resistance of the individual components increases a greater amount and the thermal resistance of the whole area increases relatively less, so that the thermal resistances are more similar than when they were for the Case Study home. In the Case Study home the Uvalue of the thermal bridge area is more similar to the Uvalue of the components unlike the Passive House design. As the thermal resistance of the building envelopes increases the area of the potential thermal bridge will more closely reflect the thermal resistance of the individual components. Also since the thickness of the components has increased the difference in the length between the individual members and the whole area has increased.

49

The temperature profiles seen in the Table above indicate that there is a consistent temperature across the building assemblies. This reduction in thermal bridging will also create a much more comfortable home for the building owners. 5.3. Recommended SIP design

The recommended SIP design for increased thermal resistance was selected based on the analysis above. Considering the dense urban environment of the case study home, the amount of thermal resistance to panel thickness is maximized. The preferred insulation that was selected was polyisocyanurate due to its high thermal performance. The structural boards that were selected were orientated strand board containing Magnesium Oxide as this would further increase the thermal performance of the panels when compared to plywood or OSB without compromising the structure stability of the panels themselves. The vapour permeance of the selected MgO panels was measured to be 53 ng/Pa-s-m2 (Prestige Panel, 2011). This is very similar to Insulated Fiber Cement Boards measured to be 43 ng/Pa-s-m2 and OSB panels that were measured to be 58 ng/Pa-s-m2. The selected polyisocyanurate insulation will be increased in order to have a vapour permeance which is more than the outer boards. SIPs can also be built with a variety of different types of cladding. The cladding selected for the SIP should be able to deal with bulk moisture (such as rain) in order to protect the SIP underneath. The exact thickness of the SIPs was established by the thermal resistance requirements to meet the Passive House standards using PHPP software. The SIP design would have to include a double stud wall in order to reach the thermal resistance requirements and also help to reduce thermal bridging in the overall design. The recommended SIP design included the upgrades listed in the following table.

The total thickness of the panels listed in the table above is the outer dimensions, from sheathing to sheathing. It was found that in this analysis the thermal conductance had to be 0.05 W/m2K to achieve the standard. The increase of the resistivity of the material itself meant that the panel thickness did not have to increase as much to meet the same increase in total panel resistance. The increase in the thickness of the walls of the home reduces the interior volume of the new design. This means that there is less volume for the surface area of the home. This design also includes the complete elimination of thermal bridges through the detailed design process and new materials used. 5.3.1. Recommendations for HOT2000 Upgrades The energy end use breakdown provides information that can be used to determine which areas of the building are consuming the most energy. The energy end use breakdown when compared to the national average indicates potential areas of improvement. The main areas of energy efficient recommendations for this home will be lighting, plumbing fixtures and the building enclosure. A compliance table from SB-12 is shown below to summarize how the home compares to the local code and how it can be improved. The home was built before this code had been implemented; the table shows how it compares to new buildings that would be built today.

51

The goal of an R-2000 home is to be more efficient than standard construction. The following table shows the value of the current components in the case study home and the potential upgrades to the new SB-12 Requirements of the Ontario Building Code (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2011).

The home meets the majority of the OBC SB-12 prescriptive requirements. The main building component that could be improved is the heat recovery effectiveness followed by the above grade wall thermal resistance. Since the building in it's current state is achieving the R-2000 standard, these requirements will not be incorporated into the design. 5.3.2. Passive House Planning Package Results Recommendations PHPP has provided recommendations to enable building designers to achieve Passive House Standards (PHPP 2007).

The suggested values for the improvement were taken from the Passive House Planning Package (2007) and potential values in the software itself. The software provides a database of products to choose from when designing a home. The availability of these products in area was not reviewed as part of this study. The goal of this analysis is to reduce the specific space heating demand of the building from 117 kW/m2yr to 15 kW/m2yr. The first step in achieving this reduction is to minimize heat loses through the building envelope. A number of case studies that had achieved the Passive House standard from the literature review were considered when determining the appropriate changes that would need to be made to the house. A similar certified Passive House is the Smith House. Although the house was not built with SIPs, the climate is similar to Toronto. Toronto has approximately 4000 Heating Degree Days and Urbana, Illinois has 4600 Heating Degree Days. As such the required thermal properties of the home would be similar as well. The Smith House was built in Urbana, Illinois and had 350 mm of EPS underneath the foundation slab and an additional 152 mm of insulation on the exterior of the wall (Stecher, 2008). The other specifications of the home are summarized in the following table.

53

Table 13: PHPP Specifications of a similar home

This house achieved Passive House standards with a specific space heating requirement of 8 kWh/m2 per year. The windows also had coatings with different SHGC depending on the orientation. The greatest SHGC windows were strategically placed on the south end of the building. In operation the average base electrical load for the house was 265 kWh per month (for the year 2005). The recommended thermal envelope of the home was summarized in Table 9. The use of similar case study home was used in determining appropriate measures that can help to achieve Passive House. After the building envelope was optimized the requirement was then to improve the heat recovery of the ventilation air. A double core heat recovery unit was required in order to achieve the required 90% heat recovery effectiveness. The air now has to be pushed through two cores that greatly increased the fan power of the unit. All of these improvements were modeled in PHPP.

54

6. Results 6.1. Model Improvements

In addition to upgrading the SIP design to that discussed in Chapter 5, the mechanical systems were also upgraded. A new HRV would have to be installed to improve the heat recovery of the ventilation air. The Lifebreath Model 300 DCS has been selected for this home as it has a double core system for maximum heat recovery and is readily available in North America. This unit has a sensible heat recovery effectiveness of 90% (Energy Star, 2011). This unit does not come with an ECM motor although that may be requested when ordering or available in the near future. This unit consumes approximately 1.63 W/cfm. However, with an ECM motor it could be rated as low as 0.675 W/cfm (Energy Star 2011). This product does not seem to be available with an ECM motor currently and as such the fan rating of the PSC motor was included in the design. Currently the building only has one heat recovery ventilator in the basement of the building. There is a washroom located on the top floor of the building with direct exhaust; it is recommended that this washroom also has a heat recovery ventilator. Additional measures were required to achieve Passive House. The air tightness was adjusted in both models to meet the Passive House requirement of 0.6 ACH at 50 Pa. The home originally met the R-2000 requirement of 1.5 ACH at 50Pa. The lighting in the case study building is currently all incandescent fixtures that consume much more energy than required and LED lighting throughout would help reduce that electrical load by 25.2%. The windows were updated to triple glazed with high solar heat gain and argon filled, the window frames were also updated to include a super-spacer with a thermal transmittance of 0.681 W/m2K. This product is a certified by the Passive House Institute and retrieved from the Passive House Product Database. However as the Passive House standard

55

becomes more prevalent in Canada it would be assumed that similar products might be manufactured here in the near future. The house is located in a dense neighbourhood in Toronto. The houses on either side of the case study home (north and south) are approximately 1 m away. The house to the north is 1 storey and vertically 3.8 m in height. However, there is no glazing on the north façade of the home. The house to the south is a taller two storey home, is 5.4 m. The effect of shading on a new PHPP design prevented the building from achieving Passive House. A Passive House depends on an exposed solar façade in order to gain heating. This building has another building directly adjacent to it, which blocks all of the solar gains. The removal of the shading that was included in the baseline design affected the specific space heating in the PHPP model by less than 5%. In the Passive House design, the glazing on the south side of the building is reduced to 9% of the actual size due to the home beside it. However, the removal of shading the Passive House design affected the heating demand by 70%. This is not a feasible method of achieving Passive House as it would require the demolition of the neighbouring home. The home was able to achieve the Passive House specific space heat demand requirement 14.06 kW/m2yr. The specific space heating demand without considering shading effects on the home is 43 kW/m2yr. In order the achieve the Passive House standard the home must have clear undisrupted access to the south sun. The final measure required to reach the Passive House specific space heating requirement was to increase the amount of glazing on the south façade and reduce glazing on all of the other facades. The skylight was completely removed. Removing the skylight not only improves thermal performance of the building but it would also reduce the air leakage as this is one of the most common areas of air leakage. The glazing on the south façade had to increase to almost 43% of the wall area. The size of the house is also a barrier in the achievement of Passive House. The requirement to increase the thickness of the walls in order to decrease thermal losses has caused the actual heated floor area of the building to decrease. This reduction in floor area
56

impedes the achievement of a lower Specific Space Heating Demand. Passive House uses a metric for homes that is per floor area as opposed to total heating. This allows homes to be compared on a relative basis as opposed to an absolute basis. If absolute values were used then a smaller home would be rewarded for using less energy overall.The effect of the basement was also found to have a great influence on the Specific Space Heating Value. Typically Passive Houses do not have a "liveable" basement as most North American homes do. The case study home has a conditioned basement and this effect increases the specific space heating demand by 30%. A summary of all of the PHPP models and cases is shown in the following Table.
Table 14: Specific Space Heating Value of PHPP Simulations

Simulated Case Case Study Home Passive House Design Passive House Design without shading Passive House Design without shading and basement

Specific Space Heating Demand (kWh/m2yr) 117.2 42.86 14.06 9.82

The PHPP model was used to determine the measures required to reach Passive House standard. In order to achieve Passive House the building must not have shading on the solar façade. These changes were then incorporated in the HOT2000 model to calculate annual energy usage compared to the R2000 standard. 6.2. Comparison of Models

The changes that were made to the Case Study home to achieve a Passive House compliant design were done in the PHPP simulation software first. These updates were then used to update the HOT2000 model. The new Passive House design was able to exceed the R-2000 energy target by 60%. This was primarily due to the significant increase in the thermal

57

resistance of the building envelope. The changes in the window glazing and the type of glazing were also significant factors.

Case Study Passive House Design

An interesting outcome while comparing the models was how the difference in window size affects the results. In the Passive House model the increase in window size is required to ensure that there is enough solar heat gain through the windows. It should be noted that the mechanical systems were autosized by HOT2000 for the updated Passive House design, this is because the equipment will need to be downsized due to the reduction in heating loads. 6.3. Analysis of Results

The updates included in the HOT2000 model (disregarding the required increase in window area size) achieved a total energy savings of 25.8%. This home would still not be close to achieving Net Zero and more mechanical and electrical changes to the building would be required in order to achieve a near net zero energy target.

Figure 17: Total Monthly Energy Load (MJ) of Case Study and Passive House design

Overall, the Passive House Design was 47.5% more energy ef efficient ficient than the Case Study Design. The Passive House design actually did not require any heating during the months of April to November. Some heating was required in the winter months, although it was significantly less than the Case Study amount. For exa example, mple, the Case Study had required 6740 MJ of heating in January. This was reduced to 360 MJ of heating in the Passive House Design, a reduction of 95%. This new design is closer to being an actual Passive House which would require no heating at all. The Passive House standard is a standard that has originated in Germany and does not reflect Canadian building practices. The Passive House standard is best suited for new construction designs where the goal of the construction is to achieve certification. This Passive House Design had required removing and increasing specific window sizes that would not be practical in a retrofit project. The building orientation is extremely important to achieving the specific space heating demand using Passive House design principles. This Passive House design required that the windows on the south façade be increased. The building would not achieve Passive

59

House due to the location of the building and its proximity to its neighbor. The south façade would be completely shaded in actuality. The building of a Passive House would require a large exposed south façade that is capable of achieving solar gains. Since, the current case study building is directly beside another home there is no way to achieve the solar gains required. The Passive House Standard is a standard that drives the industry to design buildings to higher standards in general.

60

7. Recommendations There is a need for more research regarding potential materials that can be used in the manufacture of SIPs. This research should include more information for phase change materials and how they can be used. If more literature were available on the use of PCMs in SIPs then this project would also have considered them. The home that was built with SIPs should be monitored in order to have a more accurately calibrated model for comparison with the Passive House building to see exactly how the design updates affect the resulting energy consumption of the home. This research should be extended to include a moisture analysis of various types of SIPs. Greater benefits of SIPs may be realized by using lower conductivity foam insulations and exploring different types of materials. More research is required on the applicability of the Passive House standard to the Canadian climate and if the requirements of the standard are practical for dense urban areas such as Toronto.

61

8. Conclusions The results of this analysis indicate that the use of Structural Insulated Panels is beneficial to the achievement of Passive House certification. Throughout the literature analysis it has been noted that in many of the other case studies with SIPs the main benefit of them has been an increased air tightness that is not as easily achieved through conventional construction practices. The building could not achieve the Passive House standard with only the implementation of SIPs, the window glazing performance needed to increase to three pane glazing with super insulating spacers in the frames, the HRV also needed to be upgraded to a version with a greater heat recovery effectiveness. One of the greatest changes was the addition of glazing to the south façade and the reduction of shading to ensure solar gains. The thermal bridging analysis also identified that when the building enclosure had thermal resistance values that were lower the occurrence of thermal bridging was less. Passive House certification is achievable in Toronto and using Structural Insulated Panels will help to achieve Passive House Standards. The new Passive House design suggested for the home was also found to be 60% better than the R-2000 reference building.

Product Data
Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV) and Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) systems offered by Carrier are the finest on the market today. These units provide efficient and cost effective heat and energy recovery during the heating and cooling season when needed most. As temperatures drop below 23_F (-5_C), indoor air is recirculated periodically through the heat exchanger core to prevent frost from forming. Competitors' methods of supplementary electric defrost waste energy. Unlike rotary wheel heat exchangers which mix air streams, these cross-flow or counterflow heat exchangers ensure that there is no mixing of the stale air stream with the fresh outdoor air stream. A filter installed on the incoming outdoor air stream removes large airborne particles from the intake air stream before they enter the heat exchanger and reduces the maintenance required. The units' acoustically engineered design makes the Carrier ERVs and HRVs are the quietest on the market and ensures that comfort is felt, not heard. Unlatching two (2) suitcase style latches allows easy removal of the filters and core for cleaning. NOTE: The HRV should not be installed in an attic or unconditioned space unless provisions are made for drain-line freezing and condensation.

Control features
Basic Control: Allows the user to manually set fan speed to low or high as required to maximize comfort. Standard Control: Offers automatic dehumidistat control and the option to select continuous or intermittent fan operation. Setting the wall control to low will activate the continuous mode. OneTouch Control: Allows control of ventilator with the touch of a button. This control will operate as a main wall control. The OneTouch will operate the unit in Intermittent Mode (20 minutes per hour), continuous low speed, continuous high speed, and off. Latent Control (ERVs only): Low Exchange Mode--If the relative humidity inside the building is lower than selected, air exchange would occur with the outside at high speed. If the relative humidity inside the building is higher than selected, air exchange would occur with the outside at low speed. This ensures continuous air exchange for constant air quality. Intermittent Mode--If the relative humidity inside the building is higher than selected, no air exchange would occur and the system would turn off. If the relative humidity inside the building is lower than selected, air exchange would occur with the outside at high speed. This mode is ideal for maintaining the proper humidity level when the continuous mode cannot. Automatic Defrost Cycle Features All models offer a non-electric defrost cycle feature which prevents frost and ice buildup within the heat recovery core. When the outside air temperature falls below 23_F (-5_C) it is electronically sensed and the dampers close the outside air ports. This allows warm indoor air to recirculate within the heat recovery core. The frequency of this cycle increases as the outside air temperature decreases.

Over 100 years ago, a humble but determined engineer solved one of mankind's most elusive challenges by controlling the indoor environment. A leading engineer of his day, Dr. Willis Carrier would file more than 80 patents over the course of his career. His genius would enable incredible advancements in health care, manufacturing processes, food preservation, art and historical conservation, indoor comfort and much more. Carrier's foresight changed the world forever and paved the way for over a century of once-impossible innovations. Yet in addition to being an accomplished inventor, he was also an avid outdoorsman. Carrier recognized the power and beauty of the natural environment. This appreciation of our world and its resources continues to guide Carrier Corporation today. We will never rest on our accomplishments, but instead consistently look for ways to improve our products, our environment and our world. The PerformanceTM 96 two-stage gas furnace with Comfort Heat Technology ® feature continues the Carrier ® story with money-saving efficiency and enhanced heating comfort you and your family can really enjoy.

What Efficiency Means to You
Furnaces use gas to provide warm, comfortable heat for your home. You can compare efficiencies of different furnace models by checking the AFUE (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency) ratings, available through your Carrier dealer or manufacturer web sites. Using these ratings is a lot like miles per gallon for your car ­ the higher the number, the more efficient the product and the greater potential for savings. Actual furnace performance will vary depending on your home, comfort preferences and more. The Performance 96 two-stage gas furnace with Comfort Heat Technology ® feature converts up to 96.7 cents of every dollar spent on gas into heated air for your home. Standard furnaces can waste up to 20 cents or more per dollar.
