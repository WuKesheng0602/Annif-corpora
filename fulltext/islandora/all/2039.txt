Abstract  
The  utilization  of  polymer  matrix  composites  (PMCs)  in  the  aerospace  industry  has  increased  over  the  last  decade  due  to  their  high  specific  strength.  The  next  generation  of  PMCs  has  the  potential  of  being  used for applications at elevated temperature (ET). Work conducted in this thesis is aimed at developing  test  methodology  for  the  characterization  of  fatigue  behavior  of  PMCs  at  ET.  Conventional  strain  measurement  techniques  (e.g.  strain  gages  and  extensometers)  have  limited  applicability  during  cyclic  loading.  An  alternative  strain  sensing  technology  is  the  Fiber  Bragg  Grating  (FBG)  sensor.  In  this  thesis  surface  mounted  and  embedded  FBG  sensors  are  used  to  monitor  stiffness  degradation  and  damage  development  in  woven  PMCs  during  fatigue  loading  at  temperatures  up  to  200°C.  Results  demonstrate  the  applicability  of  FBGs  for  fatigue  monitoring  of  PMCs  in  this  temperature  range.  Also,  the  effect  of  temperature on the offaxis properties of PMCs is captured and discussed.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Developments  in  the  aerospace  industry  are  largely  driven  by  the  demand  to  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  effectively  lower  operational  costs.  From  the  structural  point  of  view,  fuel  consumption  is  directly  related  to  the  weight  of  the  aircraft,  and  one  way  of  reducing  the  weight  is  by  using  materials  that  possess  high  strengthtoweight  properties.  Composite  materials,  which  consist  of  two  or  more  distinct  materials or phases on a macroscopic level, offer these properties. For this reason their utilization in the  aerospace  industry  has  increased  in  the  recent  years  and  is  exemplified  by  the  development  of  the  Boeing  787  Dreamliner.  Polymer  matrix  composite  (PMC)  materials  are  a  particular  type  of  composite  materials  commonly  used  in  the  aerospace  industry.  They  are  comprised  of  a  polymer  matrix  and  reinforcing  fibers  and  can  be  further  characterized  based  on  the  fiber  architecture:  unidirectional,  woven  or  braided.  The  two  latter  types  fall  into  the  category  of  textile  laminates  and,  in  general,  offer  more balanced or stable performance than their unidirectional relatives [14].   The inhomogeneous and anisotropic nature of PMCs makes it difficult to determine their properties and  complicates the design and analysis of components and parts made of PMCs. In particular,  uncertainties  exist  regarding  their  response  to  cyclic  loading,  which  is  critical  for  predicting  the  lifetime  of  the  structure. As the result, components made of PMCs are often overdesigned, hence negating the possible  weightsavings.  Consequentially,  in  spite  of  the  weightsaving  benefits  offered  by  composites  over  the  more  conventional  metallic  alloys,  they  are  not  as  widely  used  as  they  potentially  could  be.   In  order  to  further  expand  the  applicability  of  PMCs  for  aerospace  applications,  additional  experimental  efforts  are  required  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  their  behavior  during  fatigue  loading  with  the  aim  to  clarify  the uncertainties.   At  the  present  time,  the  use  of  commercially  available  PMCs  is  limited  to  200°C  due  to  the  low  glass  transition  temperature  of  the  matrix  [510].  Developments  of  advanced  matrix  materials  have  shown  the  potential  to  raise  this  temperature  limit  to  300°C,  hence  giving  PMCs  the  edge  to  compete  with  metals  for  applications  at  elevated  temperatures  (ET)  [11].  In  fact,  one  of  the  experimental  programs  currently  running  at  the  Facility  for  Research  on  Aerospace  Materials  and  Engineered  Structures  (FRAMES)  at  Ryerson  University  is  focused  on  characterization  of  mechanical  properties  of  a  high  temperature PMC (carbon/MVK10), which has prospects to be utilized for jet engine components.    1   

When  monitoring  mechanical  properties  of  PMCs  during  cyclic  loading,  conventional  techniques  used  for  strain  measurements  involving  strain  gages  and  extensometers  have  considerable  limitations.  Strain  gages  have  a  low  fatigue  strain  limit,  while  extensometers  might  slip  during  fast  loading  rates  or  frequencies.  An  attractive  alternative,  which  has  gained  a  lot  of  interest  over  the  last  decade,  would  be  the  fiber  Bragg  grating  (FBG)  optical  sensors  [1218].  These  sensors  have  also  shown  the  potential  to  be  implemented for damage or health monitoring of PMCs, due to their inherit sensitivity to a nonuniform  strain  field  [1518].  In  addition,  FBGs  can  be  integrated  into  components  or  parts  during  the  manufacturing process and hence can be used to measure the internal strains [1318]. In fact, numerous  FBGs  can  be  embedded  into  the  host  structure  without  weakening  it  due  to  their  compatibility  with  common resins and small size.  

1.2 Objectives and Scope 
The  main  goal  of  this  thesis  is  to  assess  the  applicability  of  FBG  sensors  for  stiffness  and  damage  monitoring  of  PMCs  during  fatigue.  The  resultant  deliverable  is  to  formulate  recommendations  that  would  facilitate  the  use  of  FBGs  and  increase  their  effectiveness  for  these  applications.  Also,  as  it  was  mentioned in the previous section, mechanical testing of an advanced carbon/MVK10 PMC at ET is soon  to  commence  at  FRAMES.  It  is  desired  to  gain  expertise  with  the  utilization  of  FBGs  at  ET  as  well  as  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  temperature  on  mechanical  properties  and  failure  mechanisms  of  PMCs.  The  knowledge  acquired  during  the  span  of  this  thesis  will  aid  with  the  definition  of  the  test  protocol  and  with the setup of the apparatus for ET fatigue tests.   This  thesis  comprises  the  work  done  for  two  experimental  projects  that  encompassed  different  objectives,  materials  and  procedures  but,  nonetheless,  shared  the  same  intertwining  theme.  One  project  focused  on  fatigue  monitoring  of  onaxis  carbon/epoxy  woven  laminates  with  embedded  FBG  sensors. Whereas the other project dealt with application of surface bonded FBGs for monitoring of off axis  carbon/BMI  woven  laminates  at  ET  (up  to  200°C).  Since  the  two  projects  were  characteristically  different,  separate  chapters  (4  and  5)  are  dedicated  to  them.  Also,  a  clear  definition  of  the  scope  and  motivation of the each project is included in the beginning of these chapters. Similarly, separate sections  summarizing  the  experimental  methodologies  are  written.  Moreover,  since  the  focus  of  the  thesis  is  twofold,  two  literature  review  sections  were  prepared:  one  for  textile  PMCs  and  one  for  FBG  sensors.  The overview of the thesis is presented in the next section.

2 Textile Polymer Matrix Composites 
2.1 Introduction to Textile PMCs 
Polymer  matrix  composites  (PMCs)  with  fabric  reinforcement  layers,  woven  or  braided,  offer  several  advantages  over  the  traditional  composites  with  unidirectional  laminas  [1­4].  The  bidirectional  reinforcement  of  textiles  gives  them  balanced  inplane  performance,  improved  outof  plane  performance  and  excellent  impact  resistance.  Textile  fabrics  are  also  easier  to  handle  compared  to  unidirectionaltapes,  resulting  in  a  costeffective  fabrication  process.  In  addition,  woven  and  braided  fabrics  come  in  a  variety  of  weave  patterns  (e.g.  plain,  satin,  twill)  and  braid  architectures  (braid  angles,  2D  vs.  3D  braiding),  allowing  further  customization  of  properties.   Mechanical  properties  of  woven  and  braided  composites  are  comparable  to  those  of  crossply  and  angleply  laminates.  Nonetheless,  textile  PMCs exhibit some unique properties that are a direct result of their interweaving or braiding geometry.  This  chapter,  while  being  primarily  based  on  material  properties  and  failure  mechanism  of  textile  composites,  will  make  periodic  references  to  crossply  and  angleply  unidirectional  laminates  to  further  illustrate certain concepts. 

2.2 Material Properties 
2.2.1 General StressStrain Curves 

Properties  of  composite  materials  result  from  a  combined  effect  of  the  properties  of  the  individual  constituents,  the  microstructure  or  the  layup  of  the  material,  and  the  type  and  direction  of  applied  loading.  For  instance,  unidirectional  laminates  loaded  in  the  longitudinal  (fiber)  direction  possess  fiber dominated  properties  and  exhibit  a  linear  response  up  to  failure.  In  this  thesis  "failure"  refers  to  the  ultimate failure (i.e. fracture). On the other hand, specimens with offaxis plies become more influenced  by  the  matrix  properties  as  the  angle  and  the  number  of  offaxis  plies  increase.  For  instance,  Figure  1  shows the stressstrain curves of woven specimens loaded at different (a) offaxis angles and (b) braided  specimens  with  different  braid  angles  [19,  20].  From  these  figures  it  is  evident  that  with  an  increase  of  the  offaxis  or  braid  angle,  stiffness  and  strength  reduce  significantly,  and  the  stressstrain  curve  becomes  increasingly  nonlinear.  Similar  observations  were  made  with  other  layups  of  offaxis,  angle ply  and  quasiisotropic  laminates  [1,  2,  5,  21­26].   Due  to  the  apparent  nonlinearity  of  the  stress  strain  curve, the elastic modulus is usually calculated from the data in the 0.10.3% strain range [20, 2426].  4

2.2.2

Fatigue Performance 

The  onset  and  evolution  of  damage  during  cyclic  loading  causes  material  properties  to  degrade.  The  common  means  of  assessing  fatigue  performance  of  a  material  is  by  evaluating  the  reduction  of  strength,  stiffness  and  fatigue  life  with  respect  to  time  (or  the  number  of  cycles).  Analysis  of  residual  strength  and  fatigue  life  requires  destructive  testing,  whereas  stiffness  can  be  determined  by  non destructive techniques, such as strain  measurements with  FBG sensors. Therefore, stiffness degradation  can be  monitored during  the lifetime of a component and related  to its residual fatigue life or structural  integrity. For this purpose, an SN curve is frequently employed that shows the relationship between the  applied  stress  and  the  number  of  cycles  to  failure.   A  typical  stiffness  degradation  curve  of  a  composite  material  has  three  stages  [6].  During  the  first  stage,  significant  stiffness  loss  occurs,  but  it  represents  only  1020%  of  the  entire  fatigue  life.  In  the  next  stage,  which  accounts  for  8090%  of  the  fatigue  life,  stiffness gradually decreases at a constant rate. In the last stage, stiffness drops abruptly and final failure  occurs.   Moreover,  an  interesting  phenomenon  known  as  strain  ratcheting  or  cyclic  creep  was  reported  in  a  number of papers, Figure 2 [27­29]. It was observed that during the cycling loading of polymers [27] and  PMCs  [28,  29]  as  the  number  of  cycles  increases,  the  hysteresis  loop  continuously  shifts  in  the  direction  of  increasing  strain.  However,  with  the  progression  of  fatigue  loading,  the  hysteresis  loops  become  thinner and more linear, and the ratcheting rate decreases. As shown in Figure 2, after a certain number  of  cycles  a  stable  or  saturated  ratcheting  strain  is  reached.  Furthermore,  in  the  case  of  offaxis  unidirectional  laminates,  ratcheting  is  more  drastic  in  transverse  and  shear  directions  (Figure  2)  when  compared to the longitudinal (0°) or loading directions [29].  5   

  Figure 2: Hysteresis loops of a 10 offaxis PMC specimen in shear [29]. 

For  practical  purposes,  such  as  monitoring  of  stiffness  degradation,  it  is  convenient  to  relate  material  behavior after n number of cycles to the original undamaged state. This can be achieved by applying the  concept of fatigue modulus, which was proposed by Hwang et al. [28] in the mid 1980's. In Figure 3, the  line nn' denotes the elastic modulus E(n) after n cycles, and the line on' defines the fatigue modulus F(n)  after  n  cycles.  This  concept  is  easy  to  implement  because  it  bypasses  the  nonlinearity  of  the  stress strain curve, which complicates definition of an elastic modulus. 

 
Figure 3: Concept of fatigue modulus [28]. 

The  stressstrain  response  of  polymers  is  dependent  on  time  and  temperature.  This  behavior  is  known  as viscoelasticity and is also exhibited by polymer matrix composites [30­33]. The following two sections  will discuss the influence of temperature and time (e.g. loading rate and frequency) on PMCs.

2.2.3

Time Dependence 

The  stressstrain  response  of  a  viscoelastic  material  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  loading  rate.  For  instance, it was shown that at higher strain rates, the hysteresis loop becomes less nonlinear [27] and a  higher  ultimate  tensile  strength  is  reached  before  failure  [1,  21,  34].  Similarly,  during  fatigue  loading  when  higher  strain  rates  are  applied,  the  rate  of  residual  strain  accumulation  and  the  resultant  stable  ratcheting  strain  are  lower  [27].  However,  higher  frequencies  might  cause  selfheating  of  PMCs  [1,  19,  27].  This  phenomenon  will  be  discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  section  on  temperature  effect  (Section  2.2.4).   Moreover,  viscoelastic  materials  are  also  known  to  undergo  creep,  which  refers  to  elongation  of  a material over time under a constant stress level [11, 27].  The  degree  of  influence  of  time  on  the  stressstrain  response  of  a  PMC  depends  on  how  matrix dominated the particular  material is.  For example,  Branco et al.  [21] compared the effects  of frequency  (1.5 Hz vs. 10 Hz) on the fatigue behavior of unidirectional and crossply laminates. The SN curves of the  crossply  laminates  had  a  transition  point:  fatigue  strength  increased  with  a  decrease  in  frequency  during  highcycle  fatigue,  but  fatigue  strength  decreased  during  lowcycle  fatigue.  However,  in  the  case  of unidirectional specimens, the slope of the SN curve was unaffected, while the strength reduced with  a decrease in frequency [21]. Similarly, experiments conducted by Counts et al. [35] showed that bearing  fatigue  life  of  quasiisotopic  carbon/polyimide  joints  was  independent  of  frequency  (0.110  Hz).  Overall,  these  studies  showed  that  the  effect  of  time  has  to  be  taken  into  account  when  considering  the  static  and dynamic performance of PMCs, especially with matrixdominated layups.  2.2.4 Temperature Dependence 

The  discussion  of  mechanical  properties  of  PMCs  will  now  be  expanded  to  include  the  effect  of  temperature.  Earlier  tests  of  unidirectional  specimens  demonstrated  that  longitudinal  modulus  (E1)  is  nearly  independent  of  temperature,  whereas  transverse  (E2)  and  shear  (G12)  modulii  decrease  significantly  at  temperatures  approaching  the  glass  transition  temperature  (Tg)  of  the  polymer,  Figure  4  [36, 37]. In the case of longitudinal properties thermal influence is minimal since carbon and glass fibers  are  not  affected  by  temperatures  in  the  range  applicable  to  PMCs  (<350°C).  On  the  other  hand,  the  off axis  properties  are  matrixdominated,  and  the  mechanical  and  failure  properties  of  the  matrix  are  temperature  dependent  [38].  Similarly,  with  layups  that  are  more  fiberdominated,  such  as  unidirectional  and  quasiisotropic  laminates,  only  a  small  dependence  on  temperature  was  detected  [7,  8].  

7   

 
Figure 4: Relationship between elastic constants and temperature [36]. 

PMCs,  especially  those  that  exhibit  matrixdominated  properties,  experience  a  reduction  of  longitudinal  stiffness,  ultimate  strength  and  fatigue  life  at  elevated  temperatures  (ET)  [21,  34,  38],  refer  to  Figure  5a  and  b  [19].  A  more  severe  degradation  occurs  at  temperatures  near  the  Tg.  These  degradations  occur  primarily  due  to  the  decrease  of  shear  strength  and  modulus  of  the  matrix,  and  the  weakening  of  the  fibermatrix  bond  [5,  6,  9,  19].  Similarly,  at  ET  a  matrix  becomes  more  viscoelastic  and  properties  of  a  PMC become increasing more timedependent [11, 30, 37, 39].

Furthermore,  several  authors  have  noted  that  PMCs  might  exhibit  selfheating  during  mechanical  loading,  and  its  presence  should  not  be  ignored  [1,  19,  2427,  40].   It  has  been  reported  that  specimens  with  offaxis  fiber  bundles  (e.g.  30°45°)  tend  to  generate  more  heat  [24,  25].  To  deal  with  this  issue,  either  forced  cooling  [2426]  or  lower  loading  rates  (or  frequencies)  are  used  to  mitigate  the  temperature [1, 27].  8   

2.3 Failure Mechanics 
The  type  of  damage  commonly  observed  in  textile  laminates  is  transverse  cracking,  fibermatrix  debonding,  and  delamination  between  plies  or  tows.  The  general  sequence  of  damage  formation  in  these laminates was described by Khan et al. [6] and Lomov et al. [4], and is shown in Figure 6:  · transverse matrix cracks initiate in the weft or offaxis bundles and propagate along the fiber;  · as cracks saturate, local debonding and local delamination start at the tow crossover points;   · plydelamination, fibermatrix debonding and fiber fracture occur;  · abrupt and catastrophic failure of fiber bundles occurs.

Figure 6: Development of damage in textile PMCs: a) transverse cracks initiate, b) local delamination occurs between yarns,           c) delamination originates around transverse cracks and d) finally fiber breakage occurs due to delamination [4]. 

Transverse  microcracks  in  PMCs  are  caused  by  transverse  tension  and  shear  strains  [4].  These  cracks  appear  to  be  confined  within  one  yarn  and  as  a  result  are  limited  in  length  and  width  [1,  4].  As  Hansen  [1]  further  explained,  the  bidirectional  form  of  reinforcement  present  within  the  individual  plies  of  textile  laminates  restrains  damage  of  the  weak  matrix  from  developing  and  manifesting  as  a  dominant  failure  mode,  as  is  the  case  with  unidirectional  laminates.  Hence  textile  laminas  are  more  resilient  than  unidirectional laminas. Similarly, it was shown by Kobayashi et al. [10] that in the crossply unidirectional  laminates  propagation  of  transverse  cracks  in  the  thruthickness  direction  is  arrested  when  the  crack  tips  hits  the  resin  rich  area  between  the  0°  and  90°  plies.  However,  when  two  bundles  with  the  same  orientation  are  in  contact,  cracks  can  extend  between  them  [4].  Additionally,  in  the  case  of  woven  [0#90]  and  quasiisotropic  layups,  such  as  [(45#45)(0#90)]2s,  matrix  cracks  first  appear  in  the  90°  tows   and then in 45° tows [7].   Moreover,  it  was  observed  that  woven  and  braided  fibers  tend  to  straighten  out  during  axial  loading  [4,  6].  Additionally,  the  offaxis  fibers  tend  to  rotate  towards  the  loading  direction  and  by  that  creating  an  apparent  increase  in  the  longitudinal  stiffness  [19].  The  latter  point  was  also  confirmed  by  experimental  9   

and  numerical  work  by  Kawai  et  al.  [19]  on  unidirectional  offaxis  laminates.  Also,  a  number  of  authors  reported  the  tendency  of  woven  specimens  to  fail  close  to  the  grips  due  to  the  presence  of  a  complex  stress state [1, 19, 41].  Fatigue  failure  mechanisms  of  braided  laminates  were  described  in  great  detail  by  Huang  et  al.  [2].  Three  types  of  specimens  were  considered,  having  braid  angles  of:  10°,  28°,  and  a  combination  of  10°  and  28°.  Analysis  of  the  failure  modes  suggested  that  braided  laminates  are  less  prone  to  delamination  than their close relatives, the angleply laminates. After failure specimens fabricated from laminas of the  same braid angle showed no signs of delamination. Also, quasiisotropic woven laminates tested in static  tension  by  Hansen  [1]  did  not  delaminate.  However,  when  laminas  had  different  angles,  extensive  delamination  occurred.  Delamination  between  the  0°  and  28°  plies  was  caused  by  the  shear  stresses  between  them  that  were  induced  by  the  difference  in  the  longitudinal  stiffness  between  the  plies.  However,  it  was  interesting  to  note  that  specimens  did  not  fail  after  delamination,  and  the  separated  plies  continued  to  carry  the  load.  Additionally,  experiments  performed  by  Tang  et  al.  [41]  showed  that  longitudinal  stiffness  of  crossply  laminates  is  almost  insensitive  to  the  onset  and  growth  of  delamination. In the case of the 28° braid angle, specimens fractured perpendicular to the load direction  and  formed  a  zigzag  pattern  on  the  surface  (Figure  7a).  Authors  concluded  that  the  main  failure  mode  was  fiber  breakage  that  occurred  due  to  the  local  stress  concentrations.  Specimens  with  a  10°  braid  angle failed due to fiber breakage and fibermatrix debonding that caused splitting between fibers along  the  length  of  a  bundle,  Figure  7b.    An  interesting  observation  was  made  regarding  the  specimen  with  laminas  having  10°  and  28°  braid  angles,  each  lamina  type  had  its  own  failure  mode.  Previous  studies  that  analyzed  fatigue  failure  of  unidirectional  offaxis  [22,  23]  and  woven  specimens  [4]  showed  that  these types of specimens fail along the fiber direction due to fibermatrix debonding.

The  failure  phenomenon  of  textile  laminates  can  be  further  examined  through  the  work  of  Kawai  et  al.  [19]  which  investigated  the  behavior  of  offaxis  woven  specimens  during  tensile  loading  at  different  temperatures.  Specimens  were  cut  from  plain  woven  carbon/epoxy  (Tg=130°C)  laminates  with  10   

orientation angles of 0°, 15°, 30°, 45° and 90°. The onaxis (0° and 90°) specimens failed close to the end  tabs  and  the  fracture  surface  was  perpendicular  to  the  loading  direction  regardless  of  the  temperature.  Similar  observations  were  reached  by  Kawai  et  al.  [22]  regarding  the  fracture  surface  of  the  0°  unidirectional  specimens.  In  the  case  of  static  loading  at  room  temperature  (RT),  offaxis  specimens  failed  along  the  yarn  direction,  Figure  8a.  At  100°C  specimens  exhibited  necking  and  the  fracture  morphology  was  "brushy",  Figure  8b.  It  was  also  noted  that  specimens  with  the  15°  offaxis  angle  demonstrated signs of onaxis and offaxis failure modes that were induced by the transition from fiber dominated  to  matrixdominated  failure.  Overall,  delamination  and  fiber  pullout  were  not  significant.  Fracture  morphology  of  the  specimens  after  fatigue  loading  was  independent  of  temperature  and  was  similar to fracture at 100°C under static loading, Figure 8b.

A  particularly  interesting  "scissoring"  damage  mechanism  of  braided  specimens  was  described  by  Fouinneteau  et  al.  [3].  The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  the  shear  mechanism  that  drives  deformation of braided PMCs during axial loading. Authors compared the response of carbon/epoxy and  glass/epoxy specimens with a 45° braid angle. During tensile loading carbon and glass based composites  show  distinctively  different  responses.  The  glass  specimens,  being  more  ductile,  stretched  more  and  developed  less  shear  stress  than  the  carbon  specimens.  Carbon  specimens  underwent  significant  necking,  which  was  distributed  along  the  full  length  of  the  specimen.  Necking  was  facilitated  by  the  scissoring  mechanism  that  occurred  when  the  fibermatrix  interface  failed,  and  the  two  constituents  began  to  separate,  hence  allowing  tows  to  realign  themselves  towards  the  loading  direction,  Figure  9.  The  separation  of  the  two  constituents  was  particularly  evident  at  the  sites  of  tow  overlap  on  the  surface of the specimen where the matrix turned whiter.

2.3.1

Temperature Effect 

As  previously  mentioned,  PMCs  inherit  their  temperature  dependence  from  the  matrix  material.  Typically thermoplastics such as PEEK polyimide are ductile, whereas thermosets such as PMR polyimide  and  BMI  resins  are  brittle  [38].  Overall,  brittle  and  ductile  materials  have  characteristically  different  failure  surfaces.  At  low  temperatures  microcracking  of  the  matrix  is  induced  by  residual  stresses,  which  are  caused  by  the  difference  in  the  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion  between  the  fibers  and  the  matrix  [42].  As  cracks  grow  and  coalescence,  hackle  marks  are  formed  on  the  surface  and  are  considered  to  be  characteristic  of  brittle  fracture  [22],  see  Figure  10a.  However,  as  the  temperature  is  increased,  the  matrix  becomes  more  ductile  and  the  strength  of  the  fibermatrix  interface  weakens.  Also  as  noted  by  Kobayashi  et  al.  [10]  crack  growth  is  impeded  due  to  the  softening  of  the  matrix.   As  a  result,  failure  is  dominated  by  the  debonding  of  the  fiber  and  the  matrix  and  leads  to  a  relatively  clean  or  smooth  fracture surface void of any hackle marks [22], as shown in Figure 10b.

Experiments  also  showed  that  when  subjected  to  thermal  cycling  or  aging  at  elevated  temperatures  PMCs  develop  transverse  microcracks  [11,  43].  Shimokawa  et  al.  [43]  noted  that  the  quantity  of  microcracks strongly depends on the matrix material. Additional tests were performed by Ahci et al. [11]  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the  growth  of  transverse  matrix  cracks  in  woven  carbon/polyimide  specimens.    In  this  experimental  program  specimens  were  predamaged  during  fatigue  and  then  held  at  ET  for  various  periods  of  time.  Results  indicated  that  temperature  has  a  negligible  effect  on  crack  growth.  For  further  information  on  the  effect  of  temperatures  on  PMCs,  the  reader is referred to [11, 22, 38, 42, 44].

2.4 Concluding Remarks 
This  chapter  reviewed  the  stressstrain  response  and  failure  mechanisms  of  textile  laminates.  Overall,  the  behavior  and  fracture  of  woven  and  braided  PMCs  is  similar  to  that  of  crossply  and  angleply  laminates.  However,  interweaving  or  braiding  architecture  of  the  reinforcing  fibers  makes  textile  composites  more  resilient  to  transverse  matrix  cracking  and  interply  delamination  and  gives  rise  to  interesting failure morphologies. Time and temperature have an influence on mechanical properties and  fracture mechanics of PMCs, and have to be considered when characterizing the material.

3 Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors 
3.1 Fundamentals of Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors 
Prior  to  introducing  the  working  principles  of  fiber  Bragg  gratings  (FBGs),  it  is  essential  to  have  an  understanding of the anatomy of an optical fiber (OF), Figure 11a.  Light travels through the core section  of  the  fiber  by  employing  the  principle  of  total  internal  reflection.  This  occurs  because  the  core  and  the  cladding  are  made  from  different  types  of  glass  and  have  different  indices  of  refraction.  The  buffer,  which  is  an  outer  part  of  an  OF,  serves  as  a  protective  layer  since  the  bare  fiber  (cladding  and  core)  is  very  fragile.  It  is  usually  made  from  polyacrylate  or  polyimide  coating.  An  important  property  of  this  coating is its compatibility with common resins, a vital factor for embedding purposes.  Silica  glass  is  photosensitive,  and  its  index  of  refraction  increases  when  it  is  subjected  to  intense  laser  radiation [45]. This property of glass can be utilized to write or create a periodic variation of the index of  refraction  in  the  core  of  an  OF  by  exposing  it  to  an  ultravioletlaser  light.  A  common  method  is  a  phase  masking  technique.  The  resultant  pattern  acts  as  a  stopband  filter  to  reflect  a  narrow  band  of  wavelengths  close  to  the  Bragg  wavelength  B  while  transmitting  other  wavelengths  [46].  This  coined  the term, fiber Bragg grating. This principle is illustrated in Figure 11b.

    b)

There  are  different  types  of  FBGs.  Uniform  FBGs,  which  will  be  the  focus  of  further  discussion,  are  most  commonly  used  for  damage,  strain  and  temperature  monitoring.  The  particular  Bragg  wavelength,  to  which  an  FBG  is  sensitive,  is  influenced  by  the  index  of  refraction  neff  and  the  period  of  the  grating  ,  as  shown in Eq. 1 [47]. The term uniform implies a constant grating period.

From  Eq.  1  it  is  evident  that  a  change  in  the  index  of  refraction  or  period  will  lead  to  a  shift  of  the  Bragg  wavelength.  This  relation  can  be  further  expanded  to  account  for  the  effect  of  strain,  temperature  and  fiber properties of the Bragg wavelength, as described by Eq. 2 [47],

where  Pij  is  the  Pockel's  coefficient  of  the  stressoptic  tensor,    is  the  Poisson's  ratio  of  an  OF,    is  the  applied  strain,    is  the  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion  of  an  OF,  T  is  the  temperature  and  T  is  the  change of temperature.   Equation 2  can  be  divided  into  the  two  parts:  strain  load  influence  and  temperature  influence.  The  FBG  strain response arises due to both the physical elongation of the sensor (change of a grating period) and  the changes in its properties due to photoelastic effects. The thermal response arises due to the thermal  expansion  of  the  OF  and  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  neff.  To  simplify  the  expression  of  Eq.  2,  factor  f  (Eq.  3)  can  be  introduced  by  combining  all  the  photoelastic  constants.  Based  on  the  typical  properties of an OF, as were given by Tao et al. [48], the factor f has an approximate value of 0.8. Under  constant  temperature  conditions  Eq.  2  can  be  transformed  into  a  strainwavelength  relationship,  as  presented  by  Eq.  4.  Alternatively,  under  constant  strain  conditions,  the  temperaturewavelength  expression takes the form of Eq. 5. The more frequently used form of this expression is Eq. 6, where KT is  the experimentally measured coefficient of thermal sensitivity of the FBG [49].

3.2 Concerns with FBGs 
This  section  discusses  certain  concerns  regarding  the  use  of  FBGs  and  the  current  approaches  or  best  practices used to overcome them. The three main concerns are: the effect of the embedded FBGs on the  host  material,  the  proper  bonding  of  the  surface  mounted  FBGs,  and  the  ability  of  FBGs  to  withstand  cyclic loading.  3.2.1 Embedded FBGs 

The  use  of  embedded  FBGs  is  advantageous  as  they  can  be  integrated  into  the  component  during  the  manufacturing process and can provide useful information about the internal strains in the material. The  early  works  involving  embedded  FBGs,  or  fiber  optic  sensors,  were  geared  towards  the  analysis  of  its  effect  on  the  microstructure  of  the  host  material  and  its  mechanical  properties.  Detailed  reviews  and  summaries  of  such  works  are  available  in  open  literature  [50].  Overall,  studies  have  shown  that  the  effects of embedded OFs on the host material vary significantly depending on the material type, loading,  layup,  and  OF  configuration  [51].  The  worst  material  property  degradation  is  achieved  when  an  OF  is  embedded  perpendicular  to  the  load  carrying  fibers  and  the  loading  direction.  In  fact,  most  researches  that  have  employed  embedded  FBGs  for  strain  monitoring  of  composites  (except  for  woven  or  braided)  embedded  the  OF  parallel  to  the  adjacent  unidirectional  fibers  and  the  loading  direction  [52].  This  placement `shields' the OF from matrix cracking and minimizes its effect on the composite [52].   However,  this  may  give  rise  to  a  new  problem  of  embedding  fiber  optic  sensors  in  woven  or  braided  materials.  Several  researchers  explored  the  option  of  cobraiding  the  optical  fiber  into  the  braided  composite  directly  during  manufacturing  [53,  54].  FBGs  have  also  been  embedded  in  between  the  woven  or  braided  plies  [53,  54,  55].    However,  no  papers  were  found  that  addressed  degradation  of  mechanical properties of the specimens, and the signal quality and longevity of the optical sensor.   Another parameter to consider is the coating of the fiber. As Vieira et al. [56] commented, it is generally  accepted  that  polyimide  coating  offers  better  adhesion  and  higher  interfacial  strength  compared  to  the  standard  acrylate  coating.  In  fact,  the  combination  of  thickness  and  stiffness  inherit  to  the  polyimide  coating  used  for  optical  fibers  helps  lower  stress  concentrations  around  the  cladding  [52].  Furthermore,  polyimide  coating  is  highly  compatible  with  epoxies  and  other  polymer  resins,  and  can  withstand  temperatures up to 350C (vs. acrylate 170C) [52].

3.2.2

Surface Mounted FBGs 

In  the  past,  researchers  have  successfully  used  surface  mounted  FBGs  for  strain  measurements  during  static and fatigue tests [12, 13]. FBGs are a particularly attractive alternative  to  strain gages,  which  have  a  significantly  lower  fatigue  limit  (2,0003000  )  than  OFs  have  (10,000  ).  Also,  they  eliminate  problems  associated  with  embedding  FBGs,  especially  for  complex  parts  where  the  manufacturing  process might introduce more complications.   Overall,  when  using  surface  mounted  FBGs  it  is  critical  to  achieve  good  strain  transfer  through  the  adhesive  layer  and  a  strong  bond  to  minimize  the  chances  of  debonding.  De  Baere  et  al.  [13]  reported  a  surface preparation method similar to that required for a strain gage layout: surface cleaning, abrasion,  conditioning,  neutralizing,  plus  pretensioning  to  avoid  buckling.  In  this  study  FBGs  were  bonded  to  a  carbon woven laminate, and subjected to a fatigue loading for 500,000 cycles (5,000 , 5 Hz and 50% of  ultimate tensile strength).  A  surface  mounted  FBG  would  sense  a  lower  strain  than  that  seen  by  the  substrate  due  to  the  strain  transmission  loss  through  the  bonding  layer.  This  loss  is  small  when  the  substrate  is  thick  and  stiff  in  comparison  to  the  bonding  layer  and  the  FBG  [57].  A  thorough  investigation  of  the  influence  of  the  adhesives  layer  (its  thickness)  on  the  FBG  straintransferring  efficiency  was  presented  in  the  paper  by  Malik  et  al.  [58].    They  varied  the  thickness  of  the  adhesive  layer  (20800 m)  used  for  bonding  an  FBG  to  an  aluminum  dogbone,  while  using  spacers  to  achieve  a  specific  thickness.  Refer  to  Figure  12a  and  b  to see the micrographs that show different thicknesses of the adhesive layer. A comparison between the  strain  gage  and  FBG  results  (as  shown  in  Figure  13)  clearly  showed  a  loss  in  transmission  (reduction  in  strain values) for adhesive thicknesses above 600 m.

3.2.3

Lifetime of FBGs 

The  primary  focus  of  this  report  is  on  the  utilization  of  FBGs  for  strain,  stiffness  and  damage  monitoring  during  mechanical  testing.  However,  it  is  also  important  to  consider  the  mechanical  performance  of  the  sensors  themselves.  When  it  comes  to  high  strain  fatigue,  FBGs  significantly  outlast  strain  gages.  Thus  far,  a  number  of  studies  showed  that  FBGs  exhibit  good  durability  under  cyclic  loading  [13,  14,  57].  For  instance,  Matthewson  et  al.  [59]  studied  fatigue  performance  of  the  optical  fibers  (fused  silica  OF  and  acrylate coating) in bending at frequencies ranging from 0100 Hz. They concluded that frequency of the  cyclic  loading  has  a  minimal  effect  on  the  optical  fiber  in  the  specified  stress  range  (up  to  the  max  load  of  5050  MPa).  Furthermore,  Kosaka  et  al.  [14]  tested  carbon  fiber  and  glass  fiber  textile  PMC  specimens  with  embedded  FBGs.  Fatigue  tests  at  0.2  Hz  lasted  for  100,000  cycles,  and  the  strain  readings  from  FBGs matched those of strain gages. Additionally, in the study conducted by De Baere et al. [13], surface  bonded  FBGs  lasted  for  500,000  cycles.  In  the  two  latter  studies,  the  fatigued  specimens  did  not  show  any significant damage or stiffness degradation.  Additionally,  Tao  et  al.  [55]  conducted  3point  bending  tests  on  plainwoven  glass  laminates  with  an  embedded  FBG  and  concluded  that:  when  the  variation  of  temperature  is  less  than  10°C  and  the  measured strain is greater than 0.1%, the temperature effect on the measurement is negligible.

3.3 Damage Monitoring with FBGs 
When  an  FBG  is  exposed  to  a  nonuniform  strain  field,  its  spectrum  will  become  distorted.  This  distortion hinders strain measurement capabilities of  the FBG as it  becomes  difficult  to detect the Bragg  wavelength. Conversely, this property enables FBGs to detect damage since presence of damage creates  a  nonuniform  strain  field.  This  section  will  discuss  the  sensitivity  of  an  FBG  to  damage  formation  with  respect  to  different  strain  fields,  grating  lengths,  and  sensor  locations  and  will  review  the  direct  applications of FBGs for damage monitoring.  3.3.1 Sensitivity of FBGs to NonUniform Strain 

To  illustrate  the  sensitivity  of  FBGs  to  a  nonuniform  strain  distribution,  the  reader  is  referred  to  the  numerical  study  performed  by  Ling  et  al.  [60].  In  this  study  FBG  reflected  spectra  were  simulated  for  cycling  loading  under  uniform,  linear  and  quadratic  strain  distributions.  Results  presented  in  Figure  14a c, show that the shape (or its distortion) and the reflectivity of the FBG are all strongly dependent on the  strain gradient.   a)             b)                c) 

 
Figure 14: Comparison between the resultant FBG spectra subjected to a) uniform strain gradient, b) linear small strain  gradient and c) linear large strain gradient during cyclic loading [60]. 

When  it  comes  to  the  presence  of  damage  in  a  material,  the  strain  gradient  is  directly  related  to  its  position  and  location  with  respect  to  the  damage  epicenter.  The  study  by  Shin  et  al.  [61]  examined  and  compared  the  ability  of  FBGs  embedded  at  four  different  locations  to  sense  fatigue  damage,  which  originated  at  the  circular  hole  in  the  center  of  a  quasiisotropic  laminate.  It  was  observed  that  when  damage  had  `reached'  the  FBG,  its  loading  spectra  widened  and  the  intensity  of  the  signal  decreased.  It  was  also  observed  that  the  FBG  closest  to  the  openhole  chirped  more  and  earlier  on  during  the  test  than the other FBGs since it was exposed to a higher strain field. In fact, spectrum of the FBG placed the 

20   

farthest  away  from  the  hole  did  not  chirp  during  the  test.  Hence  the  position  of  the  FBG  is  extremely  important when it comes to damage monitoring.  Moreover,  the  ability  of  embedded  FBGs  to  detect  delamination  and  their  sensitivity  to  it  was  further  examined  by  Ling  et  al.  [62,  63].  The  earlier  study  [62]  aimed  to  characterize  the  response  of  the  FBG  loading spectra to damage in terms of the different thruthickness locations of delamination. The grating  was  positioned  such  that  the  tip  of  the  delamination  occurred  at  the  center  of  the  grating.  The  specimens  were  statically  loaded  in  3point  bending,  and  the  loading  spectra  were  captured  with  an  optical  spectrum  analyzer  (OSA).  Results  showed  that  the  FBG  spectra  remained  essentially  unchanged  when  the  site  of  damage  was  far  away  (Figure  15a),  and  it  became  significantly  distorted  when  the  site  of  damage  was  nearby  (Figure  15b).  This  further  highlights  the  sensitivity  of  the  FBG  spectra  to  the  location of damage.  a)  b)

       
Figure 15: Response of an FBG when the site of damage is a) far from and b) close to the sensor [62]. 

 

Additionally,  the  influence  of  the  grating  length  on  the  sensitivity  of  FBGs  to  a  nonuniform  strain  field  was discussed in the paper by Peters et al. [64]. FBGs of two different lengths (1.5 mm and 10 mm) were  embedded  into  an  epoxy  specimen  at  different  distances  from  the  tip  of  the  notch,  which  effectively  created  the  nonuniform  strain.  It  was  found  that  when  FBGs  were  sufficiently  far  from  the  notch  their  strain  readings  were  identical  regardless  of  the  length  of  the  grating.  However,  in  the  vicinity  of  the  notch  (<3  mm)  signals  of  the  1.5  mm  grating  and  the  10  mm  grating  became  distinctively  different.  In  addition,  the  spectrum  of  the  10  mm  grating  became  chirped,  whereas  the  spectrum  of  the  1.5  mm  grating  remained  as  a  single  pick.  Thus  the  1.5  mm  grating  was  small  enough  to  stay  unaffected  by  the  strain field; in other words, strain was uniform with  respect to the scale of the gage length. Hence it  can  be  concluded  that  short  gratings  measure  strains  at  a  single  point  and  might  not  detect  crack  formation  that occurs beyond their length. Moreover, long gratings provide strain measurements of a broader area  and  are  more  sensitive  to  strain  nonuniformity  caused  by  cracking.  Hence  long  gratings  are  more  21   

suitable  for  qualitative  crack  monitoring,  but  their  ability  to  measure  strain  might  be  impaired  due  to  strain nonuniformities.  Peters et al. [64] further noted that when an FBG is embedded, its analysis is further complicated due to  the  heterogeneity  of  the  host  material.  The  spectrum  might  become  chirped  due  to  inherent  microstructural  strain  variations  present  in  the  material  even  in  the  absence  of  actual  damage.  An  example  of  this  is  in  the  paper  by  Güemes  et  al.  [65]  that  showed  that  surface  mounted  FBGs  measured  a  10%  difference  in  strain  values  between  warp  and  weft  fibers  of  a  woven  material.  Hence  material  nonhomogeneity has to be considered when choosing the length of a grating.  Kosaka  et  al.  [66]  discussed  the  ability  of  FBGs  to  measure  strain  accurately  in  the  presence  of  damage  (i.e.  nonuniform  strain  field).  In  this  study  FBGs  were  embedded  into  a  flat  braided  PMC.  Static  tensile  loading  was  applied  on  the  specimen,  and  the  strain  levels  were  monitored  with  an  FBG  and  a  strain  gage.  It  was  found  that  the  two  sensors  agreed  well  up  to  0.8%  strain,  but  the  signal  from  the  FBG  became  discontinuous  above  this  strain  level.  By  further  considering  the  FBG  spectra  recorded  at  different  strain  levels,  it  was  evident  that  the  sensor  detected  a  varying  strain  distribution  due  to  the  formation  of  damage  and  as  a  result  became  chirped.  Hence  chirping  signals  the  onset  of  damage  but  complicates strain analysis of the FBG data.   3.3.2 Damage Monitoring via FBG Spectral Analysis 

The  previous  section  discussed  the  sensitivity  of  FBGs  to  the  presence  of  damage,  and  this  can  provide  useful  insider  information,  especially  with  an  embedded  FBG,  regarding  the  damaged  state  of  the  material.  Articles  that  will  be  reviewed  in  this  section  were  selected  with  the  aim  to  better  illustrate  to  the  reader  the  type  of  changes  that  FBG  spectra  might  undergo  during  damage  initiation,  growth  and  possibly  saturation.  Also,  certain  differences  between  the  types  of  chirping  caused  by  transverse  cracking  and  delamination  will  be  highlighted.  The  author  found  these  articles  especially  helpful  when  interpreting  spectra  data  during  the  course  of  her  thesis.  Additional  articles  on  the  subject  are  included  in the reference section [67­77].  Takeda et al. [15] applied embedded FBGs to monitor delamination in crossply laminates subjected to a  4point  flexural  static  loading.  As  damage  initiated,  the  presence  of  cracking  resulted  in  a  severely  chirped  spectrum  (Figure  16a),  whereas  delamination  led  to  a  much  `cleaner'  deformed  spectrum  (Figure  16b).  It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  once  delamination  became  larger  than  the  length  of  the  grating, the spectrum was restored to its original `clean' single peak, Figure 16c. They further noted that  22   

with  the  onset  of  delamination,  the  spectrum  split  into  two  peaks  representing  the  bonded  and  the  delaminated  regions.  Also,  the  relative  intensity  of  the  two  peaks  changed  as  delamination  increased.  Hence  the  peak  that  corresponded  to  the  delaminated  portion  of  the  FBG  started  with  a  low  intensity  and significantly increased in intensity as delamination had propagated.  

a)                                                            b)

Figure 16: FBG spectra recorded when a) transverse crack had formed, b) delamination initiated and c) delamination became  larger than the length of the grating [15].  

Moreover,  Takeda  et  al.  [16]  demonstrated  the  ability  of  an  FBG  embedded  into  a  composite  repair  patch  to  monitor  debonding  of  the  patch.  In  this  study  [17]  a  clear  differentiation  was  made  between  the  different  spectral  changes  characteristic  to  the  onset  and  the  progression  of  the  different  failure  mechanism  (cracking,  debonding).  Figure  17,  illustrates  how  the  presence  of  transverse  cracks  influences the strain distribution in the vicinity of the grating and shows the resultant chirped spectrum.  On  the  other  hand,  debonding  (or  delamination)  has  a  more  pronounced  effect  on  the  spectrum,  causing  the  spectrum  to  split  into  two  distinctive  peaks,  each  representing  the  bonded  and  the  debonded regions. Takeda et al. [16] also noted that it was possible to define a relationship between the  length  of  the  debonded  region  and  the  intensities  of  the  two  peaks  (lA/IB),  where  B  corresponds  to  bonded  and  A  to  debonded  areas.  Figure  18,  shows  the  influence  of  applied  loading  on  the  spectral  shift; two possible locations of the debonded region along the length of the grating are considered.

The discussion of delamination monitoring would not be complete without considering the possibility of  the FBG starting to debonding. Kadoya et al. [17] reported debonding of an embedded FBG during cyclic  loading of a holed CFRP laminate. Based on the FBG spectral analysis it was noted that after 1,000 cycles  the  FBG  spectrum  chirped  and  widened  (Figure  19a),  but  after  10,000  it  regained  its  original  shape  (single  narrow  peak,  Figure  19b).  These  results  suggested  that  the  FBGs  had  debonded.  Knowledge  of  24   

the  debonding  time  is  important  as  it  directly  impacts  the  available  utilization  time  of  the  FBG  for  damage monitoring.

The discussion can be further continued by touching upon the application of embedded FBGs to monitor  transverse cracks during tensile testing of crossply carbon laminates.  The resultant FBG response to the  initiation  and  growth  of  transverse  cracks  is  presented  in  Figure  20.  Figure  20  shows  that  with  an  increase  in  the  crack  density  (point  B),  the  spectrum  became  distorted:  intensity  decreased,  additional  peaks  appeared  and  the  spectrum  broadened.  However,  as  the  crack  density  came  close  to  saturation  (point D),  the spectrum was restored to  a narrow single peak. Takeda [18] explained  this observation by  stating  that  presence  of  cracks  (small  density)  had  created  a  nonuniform  strain  field  that  led  to  a  distortion  of  the  FBG  spectrum.  However,  as  the  crack  density  approached  saturation,  the  distance  between  the  two  neighboring  cracks  decreased,  thus  reducing  the  strain  variation  and  causing  the  spectral shape to regain its original (predamaged) single narrow peak.

3.4 Concluding Remarks 
This  chapter  reviewed  the  working  principles  of  FBG  sensors,  identified  possible  concerns  with  their  utilization,  and  discussed  their  sensitivity  to  damage  development.  FBGs  are  sensitive  to  strain  and  strain  gradients  present  in  the  material  and  have  been  successfully  utilized  for  strain  and  damage  monitoring  [1218,  5255,  6676].  While  their  sensitivity  to  strain  nonlinearity  gives  them  the  ability  to  detect  and  monitor  damage,  it  also  hinders  their  ability  to  provide  a  clear  strain  measurement.  Hence  the length of an FBG and its location with respect to damage prone area, have to be considered in order  to  achieve  optimal  strainfield  sensitivity.  Moreover,  when  utilizing  the  surface  mounted  FBGs  care  should  be  taken  when  bonding  the  OF  in  order  to  ensure  proper  strain  transfer  through  the  adhesive  layer.  In  the  case  of  embedded  FBGs,  location  of  an  OF  has  to  be  carefully  chosen  in  order  to  minimize  the intrusive effect of an OF on the mechanical properties of the host material and to limit the possibility  of an FBG failure due to OF breakage.

4 Fatigue Monitoring at Room Temperature  
4.1 Motivation and Objectives 
An  interesting  potential  application  of  fiber  Bragg  grating  (FBG)  sensors  is  for  the  inservice  structural  health  monitoring  of  aerostructures.  Further  development  of  this  technology  would  reduce  the  time  and  cost  associated  with  downtime  needed  for  structural  inspections.  Thus  far,  embedded  FBG  sensors  have been successfully applied to damage and stiffness monitoring of composite laminates [67­76]. The  common methodology for embedding an OF is to orient it in the loading direction and place it parallel to  the  adjacent  reinforcing  fibers  [0°].  For  damage  monitoring  of  angleply  laminates,  the  OF  is  usually  embedded  close  to  the  interface  between  the  0°  and  offaxis  laminas.  Such  positioning  effectively  minimizes  the  intrusive  effect  of  the  OF  on  the  host  material  and  reduces  the  chances  of  the  OF  being  broken  during  damage  propagation.  At  the  same  time  the  FBG  remains  sensitive  to  damage  that  usually  manifests in the form of transverse matrix cracks in the offaxis layers and delamination at the interface.  However, this embedding configuration is essentially impossible to achieve with textile laminates.   Previous work by De Baere et al. [13] showed that FBGs, which were embedded into or surface mounted  onto  carbon/epoxy  woven  laminates,  could  last  for  at  least  500,000  cycles  at  strain  levels  of  approximately  5,500  .  However,  specimens  experienced  minimal  damage  formation  and  stiffness  degradation.  Hence  the  aim  of  this  study  is  to  test  FBGs  embedded  into  PMCs  that  develop  noticeable  fatigue  damage  in  order  to  assess  the  continued  integrity  of  the  sensor,  and  its  ability  to  monitor  stiffness degradation and damage evolution.  

4.2 Experimental SetUp 
4.2.1 Specimens 

Specimens  under  review  were  manufactured  as  a  part  of  the  project  that  was  performed  in  collaboration  between  Ryerson  University  and  Kyoto  Institute  of  Technology  and  was  aimed  at  investigating  embedding  methods  for  fiber  optic  sensors.  Specimens  were  manufactured  by  a  wet  hand  layup  method,  which  is  a  basic  technique  usually  employed  during  early  stages  of  PMC  development.  During  this  process  dry  fabric  is  impregnated  by  pouring  a  desired  amount  of  resin  over  it  and  using  a  hand  roller  to  evenly  distribute  resin  and  eliminate  voids.  The  resultant  laminates  were  composed  of  two  layers  of  plain  carbon  woven  fabric  (T300,  TORAY  Co.,  Ltd.)  oriented  in  [0#90]  direction  and  27   

vinylester  resin  (RIPOXY  R806,  Showa  Highpolymer  Co.,  Ltd.).  During  the  fabric  layup,  an  optical  fiber  with  three  FBGs  was  placed  in  between  the  two  layers  and  oriented  in  the  longitudinal  [0°]  direction.  The  specimen  dimensions  and  the  positioning  of  the  OF  and  FBGs  are  illustrated  in  Figure  21a.  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  the  OF  was  loosely  affixed  to  the  woven  fabric;  hence  it  could  move  during  the  manufacturing  process.  Further  information  on  the  manufacturing  process  can  be  found  in  the  MASc  thesis prepared by Kolubinski [77].

Fiber  optic  sensors  were  fabricated  at  the  Fiber  Optic  Communication  and  Sensing  Laboratory  at  Ryerson  University.  FBGs  were  written  on  a  SMF28  fiber  with  polyacrylate  coating  (   250 m)  by  using  a phase mask method. A more detailed description of the method can be found in the paper by Lu et al.  [78].  Once  the  gratings  were  written,  they  were  coated  with  protective  polyimide  coating  (   160  m)  and  annealed  at  150°C  for  15  hours  to  ensure  their  longterm  stability.  Gratings  were  3  mm  in  length,  had wavelengths in the range of 15351555 nm and were written 51 mm (2 in) apart.   Also,  a  strain  gage  (EA06250AE350,  Vishay)  was  used  to  validate  FBG  strain  measurement.  It  was  bonded  to  the  center  of  the  specimen  using  instant  adhesive  (Loctite  496),  as  shown  in  Figure  21a.  To  ensure  proper  adhesion,  the  surface  of  the  specimen  was  degreased,  wet  abraded  (400  grid),  conditioned,  and  neutralized.  Prior  to  testing,  aluminum  end  tabs  51  x  51  mm  (2  x  2  in)  were  bonded  to  the specimens using twopart epoxy (Araldite 12). Figure 21b shows the prepared specimen in the grips.

Test Protocol 

All  tests  were  conducted  at  Ryerson  University  at  the  Facility  for  Research  on  Aerospace  Materials  and  Engineered Structures (FRAMES) using an MTS 322 test frame, MTS 647 hydraulic wedge grips, and MTS  FlexTest  GT/Teststar  IIm  controller  and  data  acquisition  unit.  In  order  to  monitor  stiffness  degradation  and  capture  damage  evolution,  interrupted  fatigue  tests  were  performed  in  combination  with  static  tests.  Data  recorded  during  fatigue  tests  was  used  to  assess  the  usability  of  FBGs  for  realtime  health  monitoring,  while data from the static tests was used to  measure specimen stiffness degradation during  fatigue. Specimens were tested at different strain levels, which are summarized in (Table 1). 
Table 1: Summary of the specimens tested and the corresponding applied fatigue loads and initial strain levels (prior to  stiffness degradation).

Fatigue tests were performed under force control with a sinusoidal waveform, a stress ration R = 0.1 and  a  frequency  of  5Hz.  They  were  run  in  blocks  of  1,000  or  5,000  cycles  in  the  early  stages  of  fatigue  (<50,000) in order to adequately capture the initial stiffness drop (to be discussed in Section 4.5). During  the  later  stages  of  fatigue,  since  stiffness  degradation  was  subtle  and  did  not  required  frequent  monitoring,  tests  were  run  in  sets  of  50,000100,000  cycles.  During  cyclic  tests  FBG  wavelength  and  forcedisplacement data were recorded with the Micron Optics Si425 interrogator and the linear voltage  differential transducer (LVDT), respectively.   Two  types  of  static  tests  were  performed  in  between  the  fatigue  intervals.  First,  a  quasistatic  test  was  run in displacement control, and data was recorded with the interrogator and the LVDT. Then specimens  were statically loaded to different load levels (about five or seven) up to the maximum cyclic  stress, and  while  the  force  was  kept  constant,  the  FBG  spectra  were  recorded  with  the  Ando  A66331  optical  spectrum analyzer (OSA). Figure 22 illustrates the experimental setup used with (a) the interrogator and  (b)  the  OSA.  During  initial  static  tests  (prior  to  fatigue)  strain  data  was  also  recorded  with  a  surface  mounted strain gage by the Vishay P3 strain gage indicator. The strain gage data was used to provide an  initial correlation between strain measurements of a strain gage and an FBG.

Fatigue  testing  was  run  to  failure  or  was  stopped  after  1,000,000  cycles  if  the  specimen  did  not  fail.  In  this thesis "failure" refers to the  ultimate failure  (i.e.  fracture).  Once  mechanical testing was  completed,  specimens were sectioned and used for damage analysis. In the case of a failed specimen, three samples  were  cut  from  one  of  the  delaminated  plies  along  the  centerline  (Figure  23a),  and  studied  under  JEOL  JSM6380LV  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  and  an  optical  microscope  with  PAXcam  3  digital  camera.  One  specimen  that  remained  intact  after  testing  was  sectioned,  and  its  crosssectional  areas  were observed under an optical microscope. Figure 23b shows the locations of the cuts and the surfaces  that were observed. These samples were cut with a water cooled diamond saw and then mounted into a  puck to allow for easy handling. The puck was made from LecosetTM 7007 coldcuring resin, and a cookie  cutter  was  used  as  a  mold.  Subsequently,  to  prepare  samples  for  microstructural  or  damage  examination,  their  surfaces  were  abraded  (180,  320,  600  and  1200  grit  paper  with  water)  and  polished  (LECOR  1  micro  diamond  compound,  red  felt  cloth  and  diamond  extender).  Prior  to  moving  from  one  abrasive step to the next finer step, the surface was checked under an optical microscope to ensure that  previous larger scratches were removed.   30

4.2.3

Data Analysis 

Nonuniform  strain  distribution  in  the  vicinity  of  a  grating  causes  a  distortion  of  the  reflected  spectrum,  hence leading to spectrum widening, drop in signal intensity and peak splitting (chirping). This sensitivity  can  be  utilized  to  detect  damage  initiation  and  track  damage  progression  by  monitoring  changes  of  the  FBG  spectra.  However,  strain  measurements  might  become  problematic  due  to  excessive  chirping.  To  study  stiffness  degradation,  it  is  important  to  obtain  the  average  strain  acting  on  the  grating  along  its  length. Thus instead of using the peak wavelength to track spectral shifts, an effective Bragg wavelength  was found by applying the following steps (see Figure 24):  1. Measure power at the peak wavelength (max power or intensity);  2. Compute halfpower;  3. Find bracketing wavelengths that correspond to the halfpower; and  4. Calculate the effective Bragg wavelength by averaging these bracketing wavelengths.  This method provided an `average' shift of the spectrum.  

 
Figure 24: Chirped FBG spectrum and the wavelengthpower points used to find an effective Bragg wavelength. 

31   

Data recorded with the interrogator was also affected by chirping. Figure 25 illustrates wavelength data,  which  corresponded  to  three  FBGs,  recorded  during  (a)  static  and  (b)  fatigue  loading.  In  these  graphs  only  the  first  five  wavelengths  were  plotted  even  though  at  times  as  many  as  15  were  recorded.  It  is  evident  that  the  reconstruction  of  such  data  is  a  tedious  process  of  questionable  accuracy,  hence  making  it  unusable  for  present  day  work.  When  chirping  was  not  significant  the  interrogator  data  was  used  to  calculate  stiffness.  Direct  synchronization  of  the  LVDT  and  the  interrogator  signals  was  not  possible,  because  the  interrogator  was  not  compatible  with  the  controller  of  the  universal  testing  machine  (MTS).  Alternatively,  stiffness  was  determined  by  dividing  the  slope  of  the  wavelengthtime  plot  from  the  interrogator  [nm/s]  by  the  slope  of  the  forcetime  plot  from  the  LVDT  [N/s]  obtained  during  quasistatic  testing.  To  quantify  stiffness  degradation,  measurements  were  normalized  by  the  initial value of stiffness.   Strain  gages  failed  (i.e.  were  no  longer  reading  strain)  early  on  during  fatigue,  nonetheless,  it  was  desired  to  compare  stiffness  drop  measured  by  the  FBGs  to  an  alternative  technique.  For  this  purpose  the  LVDT  forcedisplacement  data  was  used  to  determine  the  relative  `stiffness'  degradation  during  fatigue.  This  method  is  based  on  the  assumptions  that  the  length  of  the  specimen  between  the  grips  is  the  same  for  each  test  (static  or  fatigue),  and  that  strain  is  uniform  along  the  length  of  the  specimen.  Even  though  these  assumptions  could  not  be  entirely  met  during  the  fatigue  test,  the  changes  in  the  forcedisplacement  response  of  the  specimens  provided  adequate  information  regarding  stiffness  degradation and its severity.

4.3 Strain Measurement: FBG vs. Strain Gage 
Strain  measurements  recorded  with  embedded  FBGs  during  the  initial  static  test  (prior  to  fatigue)  were  compared  to  those  made  with  strain  gages,  as  presented  in  Figure  26.  Both  types  of  sensors  showed  a  linear  stressstrain  response  of  the  material,  which  is  be  expected  of  [0/90]s  unidirectional  or  woven  laminates  [19,  26].  However,  there  was  a  noticeable  discrepancy  between  the  FBG  and  the  strain  gage  data.  

 
Figure 26: Comparison between the stressstrain relations measured with FBGs and a strain gage (SG) prior to fatigue. 

By  considering  the  evolution  of  the  FBG  spectra  (Figure  27)  with  increase  in  loading  it  is  evident  that  peak  splitting  occurred  even  at  fairly  low  loads  (~6700  N  or  2000 m),  hence  introducing  an  error  into  strain calculations. The onset of chirping can be attributed to the presence of damage or microstructural  variation (i.e. interweaving warp and weft fibers). In fact, Güemes et al. [65] showed a 10% difference in  strain  measurements  between  FBGs  that  were  surface  mounted  above  the  warp  and  weft  fibers.  Hence  the  initial  chirped  shape  of  the  spectra  (Figure  27b)  can  potentially  be  related  to  the  warpweft  interaction.  However,  to  properly  support  this  argument  a  more  accurate  analysis  of  the  microstructure  or  the  damage  state  of  the  specimen  at  the  onset  of  chirping  is  required.  Such  analysis  can  be  achieved  by the microscopic observation of the surface and the crosssection of the specimen. Also, the sensitivity  of the FBG signal to the microstructural variations of the host specimen can be further studied by testing  embedded  FBGs  of  varying  lengths.  A  longer  grating  (more  than  a  unit  cells)  is  expected  to  better  capture  global  strain  seen  by  the  specimen,  whereas  a  shorter  grating  (less  than  a  unit  cell)  would  capture  a  more  localized  strain  value.  However,  if  the  material  is  damaged  a  longer  grating  would  undergo more severe chirping than a shorter grating, as previously shown by Peters et al. [64].  

33   

With  the  further  increase  in  static  loading  ( 6700  N),  chirping  of  the  FBG  spectra  became  more  severe.  This  form  of  chirping  (Figure  27d)  suggests  of  damage  initiation.  In  fact,  during  static  loading  cracking  was  heard  and  upon  unloading  the  specimen,  fine  cracks  were  observed  in  the  resin  rich  areas  where  the warp and weft fibers overlap, Figure 28.

The  possibilities  of  misalignment  errors  also  exist  since  these  laminates  were  manufactured  by  a  wet  hand  layup  method,  and  a  hand  roller  was  used  to  distribute  resin,  hence  potentially  shifting  the  OF.  In  fact,  upon  the  failure  of  one  of  the  specimens,  the  two  delaminated  surfaces  were  observed  and  it  was  determined  that  the  OF  was  not  straight  and  had  shifted  from  the  centerline  of  the  specimen.  Figure  29  clearly  illustrates  the  misalignment  between  the  orientation  of  the  OF  and  the  adjacent  warp  bundles.  These images were captured by an optical microscope (Figure 29a) and an SEM (Figure 29b).

4.4 Monitoring Damage Evolution 
4.4.1 Failure Characteristics 

Out  of  the  three  specimens  that  were  tested,  only  one  specimen,  which  was  fatigued  at  70%  UTS,  has  failed.  The  other  two  remained  intact  until  testing  was  terminated  after  1,000,000  cycles.  Table  2  summarizes the failure results of the specimens and the FBG sensors. Unfortunately some of the sensors  have  failed  during  fatigue.  However,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  FBGs  either  failed  during  the  first  15,000  cycles  or  have  lasted  for  the  entire  test.  The  following  Section  4.4.2  on  FBG  Spectral  Analysis  will  propose reasoning for premature sensor failure in connection to damage formation in these laminates.  
Table 2: Summary of the failure results of specimens and FBG sensors.

Initial  form  of  damage  in  woven  specimens  was  the  onset  of  matrix  cracking  that  formed  in  the  warp weft  overlap  region  and  was  observed  after  the  initial  static  test.  With  continuation  of  cyclic  loading  these  cracks  extended  in  the  widthwise  direction  and  formed  a  curvy  sinusoidal  pattern,  as  shown  in  Figure  28.  One  of  the  specimens  that  did  not  fail  was  sectioned  after  the  test.  Crosssections  were  examined  with  an  optical  microscope.  Presence  of  delamination  was  clearly  observed,  as  shown  in  Figure  30,  and  it  essentially  extended  through  the  entire  width  of  the  specimen.  Moreover,  Figure  31  clearly  illustrates  the  presence  of  delamination  in  the  vicinity  of  the  OF.  Additional  images  can  be  found  in the Appendix  A (Figure A1, Figure A2 and Figure A3).

Figure  32a  and  b  illustrate  final  fracture  of  the  failed  specimen.  It  is  evident  that  the  two  woven  plies  completely  delaminated  and  that  the  specimen  finally  failed  when  the  0°  fibers  had  broke.  Fiber  breakage occurred close to the grips along the 90° or the 45° line. SEM analysis of a delaminated surface  (Figure  33)  showed  presence  of  hackle  marks  that  are  characteristic  to  brittle  fracture  [22].  Overall,  the  brittle  nature  of  the  resin  contributed  to  the  early  initiation  of  matrix  cracking.  Additional  images  that  capture  the  nondamaged  (Figure  A4)  and  fractured  (Figure  A5  and  Figure  A6)  states  of  the  specimen  and the fracture surfaces (Figure A7, Figure A8 and Figure A9) can be found in Appendix  A.

4.4.2

FBG Spectral Analysis 

An  advantage  of  the  FBG  strain  sensitivity  is  that  it  can  be  used  to  monitor  damage  progression.  Generally,  with  the  onset  of  damage,  the  FBG  spectrum  is  expected  to  widen,  experience  a  drop  in  intensity  and  exhibit  chirping.  This  section  will  present  the  evolution  of  the  FBG  loading  spectra  during  fatigue  and  will  attempt  to  related  these  changes  to  the  characteristic  failure  modes  of  woven  laminates. In this report FBG loading spectra refers to a set of FBG spectra recorded during a single static  test at different static loads (Figure 34). 

 
Figure 34: Loading spectra of the FBG1 recorded during the initial static test of Woven (50% UTS).  

By  first  examining  the  initial  loading  spectra  (Figure  34  or  Figure  27)  corresponding  to  the  woven  specimen  fatigued  at  50%  UTS,  it  is  evident  that  peak  splitting  occurred  at  low  loads  and  became  significantly  more  drastic  at  high  loads.  After  unloading  the  specimen,  matrix  cracks  were  clearly  visible  in  the  warpweft  regions,  see  Figure  28.  Hence  it  can  be  speculated  that  the  presence  of  cracks  caused  38   

the  spectra  to  chirp  at  higher  loads.   However,  at  lower  loads  the  slight  peak  splitting  can  be  linked  to  relative  stiffness  difference  between  the  warp  and  weft  fiber  bundles  and  the  matrix  that  was  detected  by the FBGs.  Moreover,  the  spectral  shapes  (Woven  50%  UTS)  did  not  change  considerably  until  the  10,000  cycles  mark;  then  they  became  significantly  chirped  even  at  low  loads,  and  the  signal  from  one  FBG  was  lost,  see  Figure  35.  This  spectral  change  suggests  the  onset  of  a  new  failure  mode,  possibly  delamination.  Also since the stress level was fairly low for the optical fiber to break due to the longitudinal strain, it can  be hypothesized that the FBG broke in shear caused by delamination or debonding.

As  fatigue  testing  progressed,  the  spectral  profile  began  to  "clean  up".    At  200,000  cycles  the  loading  spectra  of  FBG1  restored  itself  to  essentially  a  single  peak  (Figure  36a)  and  remained  this  way  for  the  remainder of the test (Figure 36b). Such change could be caused by the complete debonding of the FBG. 

39   

This  event  can  be  anticipated  since  woven  laminates  failed  by  delamination,  and  the  optical  fiber  was  embedded between the two delaminated plies, as shown in Figure 29  Figure 32.

    b)

Similarly, by observing the loading spectra of the FBG2 after 50,000 cycles (Figure 37a), it is evident that  the  spectrum  recovered  from  its  previously  chirped  condition  (Figure  35)  and  remained  essentially  unchanged  until  the  end  of  the  test,  Figure  37b.  However,  under  low  loads  (450  N)  the  spectrum  was  split  into  two  peaks,  and  with  increasing  loading  the  intensity  of  one  peak  increased,  whereas  the  intensity  of  the  other  decreased,  Figure  37.  This  behavior  of  an  FBG  was  previously  reported  to  be  caused by debonding or delamination [16].

Furthermore,  data  captured  by  the  interrogator  has  also  improved  significantly  once  the  optical  spectrum  was  restored.  Figure  38  shows  a  sample  of  wavelength  data  recorded  around  the  800,000  cycles  mark.  Overall,  analogous  results  were  obtained  with  the  specimen  fatigued  at  60%  UTS.  Thus  far  results  indicate  that  FBGs  are  capable  of  detecting  the  onset  of  different  failure  modes  and  the  transition  between  them.  However,  additional  testing  is  required  in  conjunction  with  other  techniques,  such  as  SEM,  to  obtain  a  more  exact  correlation  between  the  damage  state  of  the  material  and  the  FBG  loading spectra.

4.5 Monitoring Stiffness Degradation 
As  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  chirping  of  the  FBGs  was  substantial  during  the  early  stages  of  fatigue  (<200,000  cycles)  and  consequently  has  significantly  complicated  strain  measurements.  To  deal  with  chirping  an  effective  Bragg  wavelength  (as  discussed  in  the  Data  Analysis  section)  was  approximated  from  the  spectral  data  and  was  used  for  the  calculation  of  strain  and  stiffness  values.  Approximation  of  the  Bragg  wavelength  was  difficult  from  the  interrogator  data  since  multiple  wavelengths  were  recorded  for  a  single  sensor  (Figure  25).  As  a  result,  only  OSA  data  was  used  to  quantify  stiffness  degradation  during  the  early  stages  of  fatigue.  However,  during  the  later  stages  once  the loading spectra were restored, both the OSA and interrogator data were used.    The  fatigue  evolution  of  the  loadstrain  curves,  which  was  obtained  through  the  OSA  spectral  analyses,  is  presented  in  Figure  39.  This  data  pertains  to  the  specimen  fatigued  at  50%  UTS.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  Figure  39  curves  corresponding  to  10,000  and  25,000  cycles  are  linear  at  low  load  levels  (<8,000  N)  but  are  incoherent  at  higher  levels  (>8,000  N).  This  incoherence  is  a  result  of  errors  associated  with  determination  of  the  Bragg  wavelength  in  the  presence  of  chirping,  which  was  more  severe  at  higher  load  (or  strain)  levels,  refer  to  Figure  35.  Hence  data  points  corresponding  to  loads  above  8,000  N  were  41   

ignored  in  the  analysis  and  hence  not  used  for  stiffness  calculations.  From  Figure  39  it  is  evident  that  stiffness  degradation  experienced  by  woven  specimens  was  fairly  high  (35%).  This  significant  stiffness  drop  occurred  due  to  the  formation  of  transverse  cracks  at  the  boundary  between  warp  and  weft  yarn,  see  Figure  29,  thus  permitting  the  warp  bundles  to  straighten  out  and  making  the  woven  fabric  more  flexible. These results are in par with previous investigations [4, 6].  

Increasing  number of  cycles 

 
Figure 39: Stiffness degradation of the woven specimen tested at 50% UTS. 

Stiffness  degradation  was  further  analyzed  by  comparing  data  obtained  for  different  specimens  and  measured  with  different  sensors.  Figure  40a  shows  the  normalized  stiffness  degradation  curves  derived  from  measurements  with  the  FBGs  (OSA  and  interrogator)  and  the  LVDT  for  the  specimen  fatigued  at  50%  UTS.  Figure  40b  shows  stiffness  degradation  curves  for  all  specimens  measured  will  all  sensors.  All  sensors  displayed  the  same  pattern  of  stiffness  degradation,  the  initial  drastic  drop  before  100,000  cycles  and  then  subtle  degradation.  Results  obtained  with  the  interrogator  and  OSA  data  for  the  same  sensor  (Figure  40a)  were  similar.  The  general  noise  in  the  FBG  results  is  attributed  to  the  misalignment  of  the  OF  and  chirping  of  the  FBG  spectrum.  Also,  the  magnitude  of  the  stiffness  drop  was  in  the  same  range among the specimens despite the difference in the applied loading.

Results  obtained  thus  far  show  that  FBGs  are  capable  of  detecting  stiffness  degradation,  but  further  testing  is  required  to  achieve  a  better  quantitative  measure  of  the  stiffness  drop.  The  main  difficulty  in  accurately  capturing  a  stiffness  drop  can  be  attributed  to  the  FBG  sensitivity  to  strain  nonuniformity  created  by  cracks  and  delamination.  Specimens  considered  in  this  study  developed  matrix  cracks  and  began  to  delaminate  early  on  in  their  fatigue  life.  However,  in  practical  applications  the  part  or  component  is  taken  out  of  service  if  it  develops  cracks  and  starts  to  delaminate  beyond  an  allowable  limit.  The  author  believes  that  in  this  study  specimens  were  fatigued  beyond  their  allowable  limit,  and  hence  FBGs  were  subjected  to  a  harsher  environment,  in  terms  of  strain  nonuniformity,  than  what  is  expected  in  practical  applications.  In  other  words,  if  a  specimen  lasted  a  larger  number  of  fatigue  cycles  prior  to  the  onset  of  any  significant  damage,  FBG  loading  spectra  would  be  cleaner  and  would  provide  an  accurate  measure  of  the  stain  in  the  material  for  a  much  longer  time.  In  this  case  the  onset  of  chirping would signal damage formation and call for further inspection or maintenance.   43   

4.6 Concluding Remarks  
In this study woven laminates with embedded arrays of multiplexed FBGs were manufactured by a hand  layup method and subjected to high strain fatigue loading. FBG signals monitored with the OSA and the  interrogator  were  used  to  derive  information  regarding  the  damaged  state  of  the  specimens  and  the  corresponding stiffness loss. Stiffness degradation detected with FBGs was similar to that detected by an  LVDT.  The  general  shape  of  the  stiffness  vs.  the  number  of  cycles  plot  indicated  that  stiffness  dropped  sharply during the initial 100,000 cycles and then decreased subtly until 1,000,000 cycles. Although FBGs  are  able  to  detect  stiffness  degradation,  further  studies  are  required  to  assess  their  ability  to  accurately  quantify its magnitude.  Spectral  analysis  of  FBGs  provided  a  qualitative  description  of  the  damage  state  of  the  laminate.  The  onset  of  chirping  during  the  initial  static  test  corresponded  to  the  initiation  of  matrix  cracks.  Further  worsening  of  chirping  appeared  to  be  linked  to  debonding  of  the  OF  or  delamination  of  the  plies.  However,  the  consecutive  restoration  of  the  spectra  suggested  of  complete  debonding  of  the  grating.  Future  testing  is  required  to  further  support  these  conclusions  and  to  precisely  characterize  spectral  changes  with  respect  to  damage  propagation.  For  damage  monitoring  the  OSA  was  shown  to  be  a  more  useful tool than the interrogator since it captured the whole spectrum.  With  regards  to  the  durability  of  FBG  sensors,  they  either  failed  before  15,000  cycles  or  have  lasted  the  entire  test.  It  seems  that  initiation  or  propagation  of  delamination  in  between  the  plies  might  have  caused  FBGs  to  break.  Hence  the  author  believes  that  if  the  OF  was  embedded  in  a  less  hostile  environment, the sensors would last significantly longer. Likewise, FBG sensors that remained functional  for the entire test demonstrated their ability to survive prolonged exposure to cyclic mechanical loading.   Overall,  FBGs  has  the  potential  to  be  utilized  for  insitu  health  monitoring  of  parts  and  components  during  their  lifetime.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  chirping  might  seriously  hinder  data  analysis  especially in the case of the interrogator data since only peak wavelengths are recorded.

5 Fatigue Monitoring at Elevated Temperature 
5.1 Motivation and Objectives 
The  development  of  advanced  polymers  that  can  withstand  prolonged  exposure  at  elevated  temperatures  (ET)  has  sprung  considerable  interest  in  the  utilization  of  polymer  matrix  composites  (PMCs)  for  high  temperature  applications.  The  applications  include  but  are  not  limited  to  supersonic  vehicle  airframes  and  jet  engine  components.  Previous  studies  have  investigated  mechanical  properties  of  polyimide  (e.g.  PMR15)  and  bismaleimide  (BMI)  PMCs  at  temperatures  up  to  200C  [8,  10,  22,  35,  43].  The  next  generation  of  polymers,  such  as  polyimide  MVK10,  will  be  able  to  raise  the  temperature  limit  to  300C.  One  of  the  main  research  projects  that  are  currently  being  conducted  at  the  FRAMES  laboratory  at  Ryerson  University  is  geared  towards  the  characterization  of  the  mechanical  properties  of  carbon/MVK10  PMC  at  ET.  The  experimental  work  to  be  discussed  in  this  chapter  was  performed  as  a  precursor  to  the  work  that  will  be  done  on  the  aforementioned  MVK10  PMC.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  familiarize  the  author  and  her  colleagues  with  the  test  procedures  and  requirements  specific  to  ET  and  to  study  the  effect  of  temperature  (up  to  200C)  on  the  mechanical  properties  and  failure  mechanisms of PMCs.  There  are  drawbacks  with  the  application  of  strain  gages  (SG)  and  extensometers  for  monitoring  mechanical  properties  during  fatigue.  Strain  gages  have  a  fairly  low  strain  limit  (<3000)  during  cyclic  loading,  and  extensometers  might  have  a  problem  with  slippage  of  the  probe  edges  on  the  specimen  surface  at  high  loading  rates  and  strain  values.  An  alternative  technique  for  strain  and  stiffness  monitoring involves the application of fiber Bragg  grating (FBG) sensors, which  can withstand high  cyclic  strains  and  temperatures.  Additionally,  FBGs  have  been  previously  utilized  for  damage  monitoring  and  have  shown  the  potential  for  this  application  [1518,  67­76].  However,  as  discussed  in  Chapter  4,  the  formation  of  damage  in  the  vicinity  of  the  grating  causes  the  spectrum  to  chirp  and  this  might  complicate  strain  calculations.  Aiming  to  address  this  problem,  two  methods  were  considered  for  bonding  FBGs  to  the  specimen  surface.  One  FBG  was  bonded  by  applying  adhesive  along  the  full  length  of  the  grating  so  that  it  would  be  sensitive  to  localized  strain  variations.  Alternatively,  one  FBG  was  bonded  by  gluing  the  optical  fiber  in  two  locations  at  opposite  sides  of  the  grating  so  it  would  function  as an extensometer.  Overall, the objective of this study is to assess the applicability of FBGs for stiffness  and  damage  monitoring  of  PMCs  at  elevated  temperatures  as  well  as  to  compare  the  results  of  the  two  bonding methods.  45   

5.2 Experimental SetUp 
5.2.1 Specimens 

Specimens  under  investigation  were  woven  (8harness  satin)  carbon/BMI  laminates.  All  the  plies  were  oriented  at  45  to  the  loading  direction.  This  material  was  supplied  by  another  party  and  detailed  information  about  the  manufacturing  process  and  material  properties  is  proprietary  and  cannot  be  disclosed.  Similarly,  in  the  results  section  the  force  vs.  strain  curves  will  be  presented  instead  of  the  stress  vs.  strain  curves  and  all  the  strain  data  will  be  scaled  by  a  factor  N.  Specimens  had  a  nominal  length  of  470  mm  [18.5  in]  and  were  cut  using  a  waterjet  cutting  technique  to  ensure  good  edge  quality.  These  specimens  were  quite  long  since  they  had  to  be  of  sufficient  length  to  protrude  outside  the furnace to allow for gripping. Figure 41 shows specimen dimensions. 

  Figure 41: Specimen dimensions, and location of a strain gage and FBGs on the surface of a specimen. 

An optical array with two FBGs was bonded in the center section of the specimen, as shown in Figure 41.  The  two  FBGs  were  bonded  by  different  techniques  to  assess  and  compare  their  usability  for  strain  and  damage monitoring. One FBG was fully bonded to the surface; adhesive was applied along the full length  of  the  grating  to  make  that  FBG  sensitive  to  the  strain  variation  in  the  vicinity  of  the  grating.  For  the  other  FBG,  the  optical  fiber  was  bonded  in  two  spots  approximately  15  mm  [0.6  in]  away  from  either  end of the grating, while the grating itself was not directly bonded to the specimen [FBGs bonded in this  manner  are  referred  to  as  partially  bonded  in  this  report].  It  was  anticipated  that  the  partially  bonded  FBGs would function like an extensometer and measure the global stressstrain behavior of the material.  The FBGs were positioned 51 mm (2 in) apart, as shown in Figure 41. This positioning allowed for ease in  handling  (during  bonding)  and  ensured  that  FBGs  were  located  within  a  uniform  temperature  zone  in  the furnace (to be discussed in Section 5.2.2). In the case of specimens tested at room temperature (RT),  only one fully bonded FBG was used and it was positioned in the center of the specimen.  46   

Fiber  optic  sensors  were  fabricated  at  the  Fiber  Optic  Communication  and  Sensing  Laboratory  at  Ryerson  University.  FBGs  used  for  testing  at  RT  were  written  on  a  polyacrylate  coated  OF,  and  those  used  for  testing  at  ET  were  written  on  a  polyimide  coated  OF.    Once  the  gratings  were  written,  they  were coated with protective polyimide coating (  160 m) and annealed at 150°C for 15 hours to ensure  their  longterm  stability.  Gratings  were  58  mm  in  length  and  had  wavelengths  in  the  range  of  1535 1555 nm.   To  allow  for  correlation  of  the  FBG  data,  a  strain  gage  was  also  bonded  to  the  surface  of  the  specimen  opposite the OF. It was positioned in between the fully and partially bonded FBG, as shown in Figure 41.  In  the  case  of  RT  specimens  the  strain  gage  was  bonded  directly  opposite  the  FBG.  For  testing  at  RT,  105C  and  160C  standard  Vishay  EA  series  strain  gages  were  used,  whereas  for  testing  at  205°C  a  Vishay WK series strain gage was used.  Overall,  the  same  bonding  procedures  were  used  for  strain  gages  and  FBGs,  while  FBGs  were  pre strained  to  avoid  buckling  of  the  OF  during  unloading.  Prior  to  bonding  the  surface  of  the  specimen  was  degreased,  wet  abraded  (400  grid),  conditioned  and  neutralized.    Two  types  of  adhesives  were  used  depending  on  the  test  temperature.  For  RT  specimens  instant  adhesive  (Loctite  496)  was  applied  and  allowed  to  airdry  at  RT.  For  ET  specimens  MBond  610  was  used  and  the  cure  cycle  recommended  by  the  manufacturer  was  followed.  With  this  adhesive,  a  set  up  involving  clamps,  aluminum  plates  and  rubber was used to apply even pressure on the optical fiber and  the strain gage during  the cure time, as  illustrated in Figure 42. Also, prior to testing tapered aluminum endtabs, which were 50 mm [2 in] long,  were glued to the specimen with contact cement.

5.2.2

Test Protocol  

A  total  of  six  specimens  were  tested  at  static  or  fatigue  loading  and  at  temperatures  ranging  from  RT  to  205C,  as  summarized  in  Table  3.  Interrupted  fatigue  tests  were  performed  in  combination  with  static  tests  in  order  to  monitor  stiffness  degradation  and  damage  development.  Data  recorded  during  fatigue  tests  was  used  to  assess  the  usability  of  FBGs  for  insitu  fatigue  monitoring.  Data  from  the  static  tests  was  used  to  measure  stiffness  reduction  and  damage  progression  during  fatigue.  Once  mechanical  testing  was  completed,  specimens  were  sectioned  and  studied  under  the  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  in  order  to  characterize  damage.  Two  specimens  were  not  tested  to  failure  and  were  used  to  assess the damage state of the laminates during the early stages of fatigue. In  this thesis "failure" refers  to the ultimate failure (i.e. fracture).  All  tests  were  conducted  using  an  MTS  322  test  frame,  MTS  647  hydraulic  wedge  grips,  and  MTS  FlexTest  GT/Teststar  IIm  controller  and  data  acquisition  unit.  For  testing  at  elevated  temperatures,  the  ATS  3210  furnace  with  an  integrated  temperature  controller  was  used.  This  furnace  has  three  heating  zones,  each  with  a  Ktype  thermocouple  for  temperature  feedback  to  the  controller,  as  shown  in  Figure  43.  To  minimize  the  heat  loss  and  promote  thermal  stability  of  the  system,  high  temperature  insulation  was  used  to  close  off  any  openings  in  the  furnace.  Additional  images  of  the  experimental  set  up  (Figure  B1) can be found in Appendix  B.

 
Figure 43: Experimental setup showing the specimen, the grips and the furnace.

Previous  calibration  tests  have  shown  that  temperature  is  uniform  (within  2C)  in  the  center  of  the  furnace. However, the temperature decreases by as much as 20C when going from the central region to  the  top  or  the  bottom  of  the  furnace.  Hence  specimens  were  always  positioned  such  that  FBGs  and  strain  gages  were  in  the  uniform  temperature  region  (~75  mm  [3  in]).  It  was  also  noticed  that  temperature  at the center of the furnace was higher than at the sides where the control thermocouples  are located. For this reason, an additional Ktype thermocouple placed in the middle of the furnace close  to  the  specimen  surface  was  used  to  measure  the  actual  temperature  of  the  specimen.   Moreover,  in  order  to  test  at  a  particular  temperature  (TDesired),  the  furnace  temperature  was  set  to  a  lower  value  (TFurnace),  and  the  surface  temperature  (TSurface)  of  the  specimen  was  taken  as  the  actual  temperature.  Temperature  values  recorded  for  each  test  are  summarized  in  Table  3.  During  cyclic  loading,  specimens  exhibited  selfheating,  which  is  anticipated  with  offaxis  specimens  [1,  19,  24,  26].  The  resultant  specimen temperature during fatigue (TFatigue) was also noted and is included in Table 3.

During  temperature  ramp  ups,  the  temperature  was  increased  at  a  rate  of  5  seconds/°C  and  was  allowed  to  settle  for  30  min  prior  to  testing.  Specimens  were  left  unclamped  in  order  to  avoid  buckling  due to specimen expansion. Fatigue  tests  were  run  under  force  control  with  stress  ration  R  =  0.1  and  at  a  frequency  of  5  Hz.  The  maximum load level used for each specimen is given in Table 3. Two types of static tests were conducted  between  fatigue  intervals.  First,  a  quasistatic  test  was  run  in  displacement  control,  and  the  specimen  was  elongated  by  2.5  mm  (0.1  in)  at  the  rate  of  0.6  mm/min.  Measurements  of  wavelength,  time  and  force,  and  strain  were  recorded  with  the  interrogator,  the  LVDT,  and  the  P3  strain  indicator, 

49   

respectively.  This  data  was  used  to  monitor  stiffness  and  generate  the  stress  vs.  strain  curves.  Secondly,  the  specimen  was  statically  loaded  to  different  load  levels  (about  five  or  seven)  up  to  the  maximum  cyclic  stress,  and  while  the  force  was  kept  constant,  the  FBG  spectrum  was  recorded  with  the  Ando  A66331  optical  spectrum  analyzer  (OSA).  Spectral  data  was  used  for  damage  monitoring.  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  during  unloading,  displacement  was  never  returned  to  a  zero  value  but  was  rather  brought  to  a  nearzero  magnitude  of  0.2  mm  in  order  to  avoid  buckling.  Additional  information  regarding data acquisition and equipment setup can be found in Section 4.2.2.   Finally,  the  mechanism  of  damage  development  in  offaxis  woven  laminates  was  investigated.  Samples  of the surface areas and the crosssectional areas were cut from the specimens and examined under the  JEOL  JSM6380LV  SEM.  To  evaluate  the  progression  of  damage,  samples  were  cut  from  failed  and  non failed specimens. In the case of failed specimens, samples were cut from different locations with respect  to the fracture zone, as shown in Figure 23. With the nonfailed specimens, only two samples (one cross section  and  one  surface)  were  cut  from  the  central  region  and  they  were  adjacent  to  one  another.  The  crosssectional  samples  were  molded  into  pucks  for  the  ease  of  handling  and  their  surfaces  were  polished  to  reveal  the  microstructure  (refer  to  Section  4.2.2).   Also,  in  order  to  enhance  the  quality  of  SEM images, samples were goldcoated in Denton Vacuum Desk IV (CTC Parker Automation).

Prior  to  commencing  cyclic  tests  of  the  specimens,  a  number  of  preliminary  tests  were  performed  in  order  to  assess  the  time  and  temperature  dependence  of  offaxis  BMI  specimens.  The  experimental  methodology and results of these tests will be covered in Section 5.3.

Data Analysis 

The  Data  Analysis  section  in  Chapter  4  was  dedicated  to  dealing  with  chirping.  However,  as  it  will  be  later  discussed  in  Section  5.5.1,  chirping  was  not  an  issue  with  the  BMI  specimens  and  the  measured  peak  wavelengths  were  used  directly  to  calculate  strain  values.  Instead  of  relying  on  the  OSA  data,  the  interrogator  data  was  used  for  strain  measurements.  Direct  synchronization  of  the  LVDT  and  the  interrogator  signals  was  not  possible,  because  the  interrogator  was  not  compatible  with  the  controller  of the universal testing machine (MTS), so synchronization of the data was performed manually. For this  purpose,  a  short  5  second  dwell  was  added  to  the  rampup  segment  of  a  static  test  at  a  low  displacement  value  of  0.2  mm.  During  the  analysis,  data  was  shifted  with  respect  to  time  in  order  to  align  the  dwell  period  of  the  LVDT  and  the  interrogator  data.  Figure  45  shows  the  strain  vs.  time  graphs  obtained with the strain gage and the FBG data (a) prior to and (b) after synchronization.

5.3 Preliminary Test  
An  initial  assessment  of  the  time  and  temperature  dependence  of  the  BMI  offaxis  laminates  was  obtained by performing a series of static tests that accounted for different temperatures (RT205C) and  loading  scenarios.  All  tests  were  run  in  displacement  control  and  acquired  data  from  the  P3  strain  indicator,  the  Si425  interrogator,  and  the  LVDT.  The  Type  A  test  consisted  of  a  single  rampup  stage  up  to  a  displacement  of  2.5  mm  and  was  followed  by  a  short  5  second  dwell  and  the  subsequent  ramp down  stage.  For  this  test  a  moderate  loading  rate  of  0.6  mm/min  was  used.  Alternatively,  the  Type  B  test  involved  a  three  stage  rampup  and  a  faster  loading  rate  of  0.2  mm/s.    During  this  test,  displacement  was  increased  to  three  successive  magnitudes  (1.0  mm,  2.0  mm  and  2.5  mm)  and  held  constant for 45 s at each level. The specimen was then unloaded at the same rate.   The  rampup  and  rampdown  segments  of  Type  A  tests  are  depicted  in  Figure  46.  These  plots  show  that  FBG  data  correlated  well  with  the  strain  gage  data  at  RT  as  wells  as  at  205C.  Strain  measurements  calculated  based  on  the  FBG  wavelength  were  within  5%  of  the  strain  gage  values.  This  discrepancy  is  due  to  the  possible  temperature  variation  in  the  gage  section  of  a  specimen  ( 2C)  or  a  minor  misalignment between the SG and the FBG.

Moreover,  comparison  of  Figure  46a  and  b  highlights  an  interesting  difference  between  the  ET  and  RT  results.  Strain  rampup  was  linear  at  RT  (Figure  46a)  as  it  was  expected  to  be  since  the  test  was  ran  in  displacement  control.  However,  the  strain  rampup  at  ET  was  nonlinear  (Figure  46b).  This  raises  a  question of whether or not this graph depicts the actual behavior of the specimen.  It is possible that the  strain  and  total  elongation  (displacement)  of  the  specimen  were  not  linearly  related,  because  different  parts  of  the  specimen  were  subjected  to  different  temperatures  and  exhibited  different  mechanical  52   

properties and levels of viscoelasticity. Alternatively, the nonlinearity of the graph could signify an error  in  the  strain  transmission  through  the  adhesive  layers.  For  future  tests  a  high  temperature  extensometer  will  be  used  as  an  additional  source  of  data  for  calibration.  Its  application  would  bypass  the errors associated with the use of an adhesive.   An  example  of  strain  and  force  data  recorded  during  a  Type  B  test  is  presented  in  Figure  47a.  It  is  evident  that  during  each  dwell  interval,  the  specimen  experienced  stressrelaxation,  and  the  force  required  to  maintain  a  constant  displacement  decreased.  An  alternative  force  vs.  strain  plot  is  given  in  Figure  47b.  Each  jump  or  kink  in  this  plot  corresponds  to  the  dwell  interval  and  clearly  depicts  the  drop  in  force  for  a  given  constant  strain  (displacement)  value.  These  results  portray  the  timedependent  properties  of  the  tested  specimens.  Furthermore,  Figure  48  compares  strain  measurements  obtained  with  a  strain  gage  (SG)  and  an  FBG  sensor  during  a  Type  B  test  at  RT  and  105C.  Once  again  it  is  evident  that  at  ET,  strain  was  not  linearly  related  to  displacement.  During  the  constant  displacement  dwell,  strain  increased  slightly.  Nonetheless,  FBG  measurements  were  in  agreement  with  strain  gage  data.  Overall,  a  good  correlation  between  the  SG  and  the  FBG  data  was  obtained  from  the  tests  that  were  performed  at  different  loading  rates.  This  demonstrates  the  usability  of  FBGs  for  strain  monitoring  of  PMCs that exhibit a timedependent response.

Finally,  the  summary  of  static  tests  presented  in  Figure  49  clearly  illustrates  the  influence  of  temperature  on  the  stressstrain  behavior  of  specimens.  It  shows  that  with  an  increase  in  temperature,  the  stiffness  of  the  specimen  decreased  and  the  hysteresis  loop  widened.  This  dependence  on  temperature is well reported in literature for offaxis PMCs and is said to signify that material properties  are matrixdominated [21, 34, 38].

5.4 Fracture Mechanisms   
Offaxis  laminates  demonstrated  an  intriguing  failure  mechanism  that  was  influenced  by  the  test  temperature  and  the  type  of  loading.  This  section  will  summarize  the  results  of  damage  analysis  at  the  macroscopic (e.g. fracture surface) and microscopic levels (e.g. crosssection).   5.4.1 Macroscopic Observations ­ Fracture Surfaces 

Chapter  4  identified  the  main  failure  mechanism  that  accompanied  fatigue  fracture  of  [0#90]s  woven  laminates.  These  laminates  experienced  extensive  delamination  and  fiber  failure  that  happened  along  the  90  weft  bundles.  The  current  section  will  aim  to  discuss  the  fracture  characteristics  of  the  offaxis  specimens  which  were  drastically  different  from  those  of  the  onaxis  laminates.  Prior  to  failure  the  off axis  specimens  underwent  significant  elongation  and  exhibited  deformation  that  resembled  necking  of  metallic materials. As previously explained by Fouinneteau et al. [3], necking of PMCs is facilitated by the  scissoring  mechanism  that  occurs  when  the  fiber  and  matrix  begin  to  debond  and  separate,  hence  allowing the fiber bundles to reorient towards the axial direction. Figure 50 shows the fracture surfaces  of  specimens  fatigued  at  RT,  105C  and  205C.  Overall,  the  fracture  morphology  was  "brushy"  and  fiber  failure  occurred  along  the  +45/45  bundles.  Similar  results  were  reported  by  Kawai  et  al.  [19]  in  relation to fatigue failure of offaxis plain woven laminates at RT and ET.   Magnified images of the specimen surface, taken  close to the site of failure, revealed many loose pieces  of  the  matrix  material  and  debonding  among  the  fiber  bundles,  Figure  51.  This  demonstrates  the  presence  of  fibermatrix  interface  failure.   In  Figure  50c  it  is  evident  that  the  area  affected  by  necking  was significantly larger in the case of 205C test temperature than in case of lower temperatures. In fact,  at  elevated  temperatures  the  matrix  becomes  more  ductile  and  the  adhesion  between  the  two  constituents  weakens  [6,  22].  Both  these  events  would  give  fiber  bundles  more  freedom  to  straighten  out  and  rotate  towards  the  longitudinal  direction.  Weakening  (i.e.  strength  degradation)  of  the  specimens  due  to  thermal  effects  is  further  supported  by  the  fact  that  at  ET  specimens  failed  after  a  fewer number of fatigue cycles than at RT.   However, in contrast to fatigued specimens, the statically broken specimen at RT did not exhibit necking  and  fractured  along  the  45  line  (i.e.  not  ±  45),  Figure  52.  Similar  results  were  obtained  with  RT  static  tests  by  Kawai  et  al.  [19].  It  can  be  concluded  that  failure  of  the  fibermatrix  interface  is  induced  by  cyclic  loading  and  is  accelerated  by  thermal  effects.  The  discussion  of  failure  mechanisms  will  be  further  continued in the next section by taking a closer look at the initiation and the propagation of damage.   55

Microscopic Observation ­ CrossSectional Areas 

To  investigate  the  microscopic  nature  of  damage  initiation  and  propagation  in  the  offaxis  woven  PMCs,  the crosssectional areas and surfaces of the specimens were studied under SEM. Crosssectional images  that  were  taken  close  to  the  site  of  final  failure  showed  a  significant  amount  of  transverse  cracks  in  the  fiber bundles as well as debonding and delamination, Figure 53a. However, samples taken from the non failed  specimens  or  from  failed  specimens  but  farther  away  from  the  fracture  exhibited  a  significantly  lower  amount  of  damage,  Figure  53b.  Hence  specimens  seem  to  have  developed  the  critical  amount  of  damage  in  a  localized  region  just  prior  to  failure.  Additional  images  of  the  highdamage  (Figure  B2)  and  lowdamage (Figure B3 and Figure B4) areas can be found in Appendix  B. 

a) 

   

b) 

 

Figure 53: Crosssectional images of samples taken from a) a highdamage and b) a lowdamage areas. 

Further  comparison  of  samples  taken  from  lowdamage  areas  to  those  from  highdamage  areas  helped  gain  insights  into  the  sequence  of  damage  development.  SEM  observations  of  lowdamage  samples  detected  a  lower  number  of  transverse  bundle  cracks  and  infrequent  sites  of  debonding  or  delamination. However, from these images it was difficult to differentiate debonding from delamination,  Figure  54a.  This  difficulty  was  associated  with  the  fact  that  the  warp  and  the  weft  bundles  looked  identical  in  crosssections  cut  at  a  90  angle  to  the  loading  direction.  It  was  hard  to  determine  whether  an  interface  crack  was  propagating  between  two  bundles  of  the  same  ply  (debonding)  or  different  plies  (delamination).  To  address  this  problem,  an  additional  specimen  was  cut  at  a  45  angle  to  the  loading  direction. Figure 54b illustrates that at  this cut angle the architecture of the sample is revealed. Analysis  of  this  sample  concluded  that  bundles  corresponding  to  the  same  ply  were  in  fact  debonding,  but  plies  were not yet delaminating.

Figure 54: Debonding within a ply and transverse bundle cracks observed in samples cut at a) 90 and b) 45 angles. 

Figure  55  also  captures  the  interaction  between  matrix  cracks,  transverse  bundle  cracks  and  debonding.  Matrix  cracks  seem  to  have  adjoined  transverse  cracks  that  had  propagated  in  the  bundles  oriented  in  the  same  direction.  Similarly,  debonding  between  the  bundles  appears  to  coexist  with  the  transverse  cracks  in  these  bundles.  This  view  shows  that  transverse  cracks  were  arrested  as  they  reached  a  bundle  oriented  in  a  different  direction.  However,  in  a  90  view,  as  shown  in  Figure  54a,  transverse  cracks  that  extended  through  the  thickness  of  two  or  three  bundles  were  detected.  It  seems  that  transverse  cracks  in  certain  locations  could  propagate  through  the  thickness  of  multiple  bundles  and  then  continue  to  grow along the fiber direction within the different bundles.

Overall,  based  on  the  crosssectional  analysis,  all  specimens  demonstrated  the  same  pattern  of  damage  development  regardless  of  the  loading  type  and  test  temperature.  Characterization  of  damage  development can be furthered by examining the specimen surfaces.  59   

5.4.3

Microscopic Observation ­ Surface Areas 

The  pattern  of  crack  formation  typically  observed  on  the  surface  of  the  specimen  is  shown  in  Figure  56.  On the surface numerous cracks propagated along the fibers at a 45 angle to the loading directions, and  matrix  cracks  formed  in  resin  rich  areas  at  a  90  angle,  as  shown  in  Figure  56.  It  appears  that  matrix  cracks  arranged  themselves  in  the  direction  of  the  transverse  bundle  cracks.  The  pattern  of  cracks  in  Figure  56b  also  suggests  of  the  alignment  of  matrix  cracks  with  the  submerged  (or  underlying)  cracks  in  weft  and  warp  bundles.   The  effect  of  fibers  on  the  growth  of  a  matrix  crack  is  clearly  depicted  in  Figure  57,  which  shows  propagation  of  a  matrix  crack  impeded  by  the  presence  of  fibers.  In  the  vicinity  of  a  fiber  bundle,  matrix  cracks  were  redirected  to  grow  along  the  fiber  direction.   Also,  an  interesting  zig zag  pattern  was  observed  in  the  region  where  a  bundle  crack  transitions  into  the  formation  of  matrix  cracks, Figure 58.  Additional images can be found in Appendix  B (Figure B5 ­ Figure B7).

This  general  pattern  of  crack  formation  was  observed  in  all  specimens.  However,  an  interesting  difference  in  surface  smoothness  was  observed  between  specimens  tested  at  RT  and  ET,  as  depicted  in  Figure  59.  In  the  case  of  RT  specimens,  the  surface  of  the  matrix  was  smooth  (Figure  59a).  On  the  contrary,  the  surface  of  the  ET  specimens  was  not  smooth  and  showed  signs  of  matrix  deformation  (Figure  59b)  that  might  have  occurred  due  to  the  increased  plasticity  or  ductility  of  the  BMI  resin  at  ET.  Moreover,  the  fracture  morphology  of  the  transverse  bundle  cracks  was  also  affected  by  temperature.  Figure  59a  shows  that  bundle  cracks  in  RT  specimens  had  rugged  sides,  hence  signifying  brittle  fracture.  Fracture  sides  in  ET  specimens  had  smooth  surfaces  (Figure  59b)  which  probably  formed  as  a  result  of  fibermatrix  interface  weakening  and  failure  at  ET.  Additional  images  comparing  the  surfaces  of  RT  (Figure  B8)  and  ET  (Figure  B9)  specimens  can  be  found  in  Appendix    B.  Finally,  matrix  cracks  in  the  specimen  fatigued  at  205C  did  not  propagate  at  a  90  angle;  instead  they  continued  to  grow  in  the  direction  of  bundle  cracks  (45),  Figure  60.  This  dependence  of  the  matrix  related  failures  on  the  test  temperature  is  anticipated.  It  was  previously  reported  that  resins  that  are  brittle  at  RT  begin  to  exhibit  more  ductile  properties  at  ET  [22].  Results  thus  far  exemplify  that  the  test  temperature  has  a  definite  effect on damage formation and growth in PMCs.   In  conclusion,  the  reader  is  referred  to  Figure  61.  This  figure  captures  propagation  of  transverse  bundle  cracks across the area, which is indicated by the glue line, where an OF was bonded. Hence the FBG was  exposed  to  strain  nonuniformity  created  by  surface  cracks  and  its  spectrum  was  expected  to  chirp.  The  following  section  will  continue  to  discuss  damage  formation  of  PMCs  and  present  the  results  of  damage  monitoring with FBGs.

5.5 Monitoring Damage Evolution  
Previous  studies  have  shown  that  FBG  sensors  have  the  potential  to  be  utilized  for  damage  monitoring  as they are sensitive to nonuniform strain fields created by the presence of damage [1518, 67­76]. The  aim  of  this  section  is  to  correlate  the  spectral  changes  experienced  by  the  FBG  sensors  during  fatigue  to  the damage mechanism characteristic of offaxis woven specimens. The differences between the spectra  of fully bonded and partially bonded FBGs will also be presented. Due to the proprietary nature of these  specimens, the number of cycles was scaled by a factor N.  5.5.1 Fully vs. Partially Bonded FBGs 

The  goal  of  the  application  of  partially  bonded  FBGs  is  to  avoid  chirping  of  the  spectra  while  capturing  the  strain  or  temperature  measurements.  Both  partially  bonded  (PB)  and  fully  bonded  (FB)  FBGs  were  used  with  specimens  tested  in  fatigue  at  105C,  160C  and  205C.  Figure  62  clearly  illustrates  that  with  an  increasing  number  of  cycles,  the  loading  spectra  of  a  fully  bonded  FBG  have  chirped,  widened,  and  dropped  in  intensity.  The  slight  chirping  of  the  spectrum  can  be  attributed  to  the  formation  of  bundle  cracks  and  matrix  cracks  on  the  surface  of  the  specimen.  On  the  contrary,  the  spectra  of  a  partially  bonded  FBG  remained  essentially  unchanged  and  the  sensor  behaved  like  an  extensometer.  Further  comparison of the strain measurements with the two sensors will be discussed in Section 5.6.2.

An  interesting  functional  difference  between  the  partially  and  the  fully  bonded  FBGs  is  the  ability  of  the  latter  to  signal  the  onset  of  debonding.  For  instance,  Figure  63  shows  that  when  a  fully  bonded  FBG  began to debond, the spectrum split into two parts (Figure 63a) and with the progression of fatigue, the 

63   

peak  corresponding  to  the  debonded  portion  became  larger  than  that  corresponding  to  the  bonded  portion  (Figure  63b).  This  property  of  a  fully  bonded  FBG  is  advantageous  since  it  can  signal  a  problem  with  the  adhesion  integrity  of  the  sensor  which  can  then  be  fixed  (i.e.  an  FBG  can  be  rebonded).  Conversely, failure of a partially bonded FBG would be abrupt. However, in order to observe this type of  a spectral change, the FBG would have to be debonding from a free (or loose) end. In order words, if the  FBG  starts  to  debond  somewhere  along  the  length  of  the  grating  when  the  ends  are  still  bonded,  it  is  hard to predict what the resultant spectrum would be.

Overall,  as  it  was  anticipated  the  partially  bonded  FBGs  are  insensitive  to  damage  formation,  whereas  the  fully  bonded  ones  seem  to  react  to  it.  The  next  section  will  discuss  spectral  changes  detected  in  this  study and will aim to explain their contributing factors.  5.5.2 FBG Spectral Analysis 

SEM  analysis  presented  in  Sections  5.4.2  and  5.4.3  have  shown  that  the  type  of  damage  observed  among the different specimens was similar. The evolution of the FBG loading spectra during fatigue was  expected  to  be  analogous  for  all  specimens  as  was  the  case  with  the  onaxis  woven  specimens,  which  were  discussed  in  Chapter  4.  However,  in  the  case  of  offaxis  specimens  the  general  shapes  of  the  FBG  loading  spectra  recorded  for  different  specimens  were  somewhat  inconsistent.  For  instance,  specimen  BMI02 showed no chirping even after 40,000N cycles (Figure 64a), while specimens BMI04 and BMI05  showed  some  chirping  (Figure  62,  Figure  64b)  and  specimen  BMI06  showed  extensive  chirping  with  a  skewed  bell  shape  of  the  curve  (Figure  65).  Hence  it  can  be  hypothesized  that  in  certain  cases 

64   

mechanisms  other  than  damage  initiation  were  responsible  for  these  spectral  changes,  for  instance,  debonding of the FBG.

Figure 65: FBG loading spectra recorded with BMI06 after a) 5,000N cycles and b) 10,000N cycles.  

The  spectra  of  the  fully  bonded  FBG  recorded  from  BMI04  and  BMI05  exhibited  slight  chirping.  This  type  of  chirping  can  be  attributed  to  the  presence  of  matrix  and  bundle  cracks  on  the  surface  of  the  specimen (Figure 61) that  creates local strain nonuniformity. In the case of BMI04, the FBG lasted until  the  end  of  the  test  and  the  spectrum  did  not  undergo  any  noteworthy  changes.  In  the  case  of  BMI05  the FBG unfortunately failed after 100N cycles.  In  contrast  to  BMI04  (105C)  and  BMI05  (160C),  the  loading  spectrum  of  BMI4502  (RT)  did  not  chirp  during  the  entire  fatigue  test  while  this  specimen  had  definitely  developed  matrix  and  bundle  cracks,  as  was shown by SEM analysis. A possible explanation for this difference is the fact that different adhesives  65   

were  used  for  these  specimens  due  to  the  different  test  temperature.  Moreover,  these  adhesives  called  for different application and cure procedures. In the case of the RT specimen more adhesive was applied  and  pressure  was  not  used.  With  the  ET  specimens  only  a  thin  layer  of  the  adhesive  was  used  and  pressure  was  applied  during  cure.  Therefore,  the  adhesive  layer  was  probably  thicker  in  the  case  of  the  RT specimen and it absorbed the slight strain nonuniformity created by cracks. Hence the FBG spectrum  did  not  chirp.  However,  the  author  does  acknowledge  the  fact  that  an  alternative  explanation  might  exist.  The  fact  that  the  loading  spectra  of  the  aforementioned  fully  bonded  FBGs  did  not  exhibit  any  concrete  changes  during  the  test  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  these  specimens  did  not  develop  any  major  damage  up  to  just  before  the  failure.  Additionally,  most  of  the  damage  was  concentrated  in  the  vicinity  of  the  fracture  surface.  It  was  noted  that  BMI02  failed  closer  to  the  grips  and  BMI04  failed  about  25  mm  [1  in]  from  the  FBG  (Figure  50b);  hence  both  fractures  happened  relatively  far  away  from  the  FBGs  while  the  sensors  remained  unaffected  by  the  onset  of  final  failure.  Previous  studies  suggested  that  surface  mounted  FBGs  are  not  as  sensitive  to  internal  damage  (e.g.  delamination)  as  embedded  sensors  [62].  The FBG loading spectra that corresponded to BMI06 possessed an intriguing shape which was different  from other specimens, Figure 65. The spectrum had a skewed shape and experienced significant chirping  after  10,000N  cycles.  At  higher  load  values  the  interrogator  detected  more  than  20  wavelengths.  It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  distortion  of  the  fully bonded  FBG spectra coincided with the  breakage of a  partially  bonded  FBG  that  occurred  close  to  the  bonded  portion  of  the  OF  during  the  initial  static  test,  Figure  66.  This  suggests  that  the  two  events  are  corelated.  Additionally,  since  SEM  analysis  demonstrated  that  specimens  developed  a  minimal  amount  of  damage  during  the  early  stages  of  fatigue,  damage  initiation  taking  place  during  the  initial  static  test  was  not  expected  to  cause  distortion  of  the  FBG  spectrum.  An  alternative  cause  of  this  spectral  change  could  be  poor  adhesion  (or  onset  of  debonding) between the FBG and the specimen.   The  effect  of  the  bond  quality  on  the  FBG  spectrum  can  be  further  illustrated  by  the  spectral  results  from  the  BMI04  specimen.  The  first  FBG  that  was  bonded  to  the  specimen  experienced  significant  chirping  and  debonded  after  200N  cycles,  as  shown  in  Figure  63.  A  new  FBG  was  then  bonded  onto  the  specimen and its signal was only slightly chirped during testing, as shown in Figure 62. Hence, chirping of  the first FBG was not caused by crack formation but rather by a poor bond quality.    66   

At this load the  partially bonded  FBG broke

Results  thus  far  indicate  that  surface  bonded  FBG  are  sensitive  to  strain  nonuniformity,  which  might  be  caused  by  a  number  of  factors  including  damage  formation  and  adhesive  failure  (between  the  FBG  and  the  sample).   A  couple  of  FBGs  expressed  excessive  chirping  that  was  linked  to  their  poor  adhesion  to  the specimens. The other FBGs exhibited only slight chirping that was probably caused by the matrix and  bundle  cracks  which  were  detected  on  the  surface  of  the  specimen.  Moreover,  these  FBGs  did  not  undergo  any  identifiable  spectral  changes  that  could  be  linked  to  a  new  damage  mechanism  or  to  an  approaching  final  failure.  This  response  of  the  FBGs  is  understandable  since  specimens  did  not  develop  substantial  damage  until  the  final  fracture;  hence  there  was  "nothing"  for  the  FBGs  to  detect.  Usability  of  FBGs  for  damage  monitoring  is  directly  related  to  the  failure  mechanism  characteristic  of  a  particular  material.  Overall,  response  of  the  FBG  must  be  correlated  against  another  method,  such  as  SEM,  in  order to be meaningful.

5.6 Monitoring Stiffness Degradation 
This  section  will  discuss  the  general  trends  pertaining  to  the  stiffness  degradation  of  the  BMI  offaxis  specimens  during  fatigue.  The  effect  of  temperature  on  the  stressstrain  curves  will  also  be  presented.  Applicability  of  different  sensors  and  the  correlations  among  them  will  be  discussed.  Due  to  the  proprietary  nature  of  these  specimens,  the  strain  values  and  the  number  of  cycles  were  scaled  by  a  factor N.  5.6.1 StressStrain Curves 

The  typical  evolution  of  a  stressstrain  response  of  an  offaxis  BMI  specimen  during  cyclic  loading  is  presented  in  Figure  67.  Reduction  of  the  fatigue  modulus  (F1F4)  during  fatigue  is  clearly  captured  in  Figure  67.  It  is  evident  that  with  an  increasing  number  of  cycles  the  stressstrain  curve  shifted  in  the  direction  of  increasing  strain.  This  behavior  is  known  as  strain  ratcheting  or  cyclic  creep  and  has  been  previously reported for polymers and PMCs [27­29]. As fatigue loading progressed, the ratcheting strain  gradually  reached  a  saturated  value  and  the  stressstrain  curves  became  more  linear.  Further  comparison  between  Figure  68a  and  b  demonstrates  a  prominent  influence  of  temperature  on  the  fatigue  behavior  of  these  specimens.  The  amount  of  strain  ratcheting  was  significantly  higher  with  specimens tested at ET (Figure 68b (205C) and Figure 69 (160C)) than with the one tested at RT (Figure  68a).  It  is  expected  that  an  increase  in  temperature  would  amplify  strain  ratcheting  since  at  ET  mechanical properties of the matrix and the PMC degrade and become more timedependent.

Comparison among Different Sensors 

The  preliminary  results  presented  in  Section  5.3  show  a  good  correlation  between  the  FBG  and  strain  gage  data.  Similarly  a  good  agreement  was  observed  between  the  fatigue  data  obtained  from  the  two  sensors, as shown in Figure 69. The minor discrepancy between the FBG and stain gage values (<5%) was  caused by the slight misalignment of the strain gage.

With  respect  to  the  different  bonding  methods,  both  the  partially  and  fully  bonded  FBGs  demonstrated  the  ability  to  detect  and  quantify  the  change  in  the  material  stressstrain  behavior  during  cyclic  loading.   An  excellent  correlation  between  the  two  sensors  was  attained,  as  shown  in  Figure  70.  The  main  advantage  of  a  partially  bonded  FBG  over  a  fully  bonded  one  is  its  natural  immunity  to  chirping  which 

69   

greatly simplifies data analysis. This is an important parameter to consider when dealing with specimens  that develop a lot of damage, such as matrix cracks, during the early stage of static or dynamic testing.

Moreover,  with  respect  to  insitu  stiffness  monitoring,  the  cyclic  data  recorded  with  the  interrogator  provided  excellent  results.  Figure  71  shows  the  correlation  between  the  strain  gage  and  FBG  data  obtained  after  2,500  cycles.  Analogous  results  were  obtained  with  specimens  tested  at  other  temperatures.  Hence  FBGs  show  the  potential  to  be  used  for  insitu  stiffness  monitoring  when  they  do  not chirp extensively.

5.7 Concluding Remarks 
In  this  study,  surface  mounted  FBG  were  used  for  stiffness  and  damage  monitoring  for  offaxis  woven  BMI  specimens  tested  at  room  temperature  (RT)  and  elevated  temperatures  (ET).  Preliminary  static  tests  have  clearly  displayed  the  influence  of  time  and  temperature  on  the  material  response  to  mechanical  loading.  With  an  increase  in  temperature  specimens  expressed  a  nonlinear  stressstrain  behavior,  underwent  stressrelaxation  during  constant  displacement  loading,  and  experienced  stiffness  degradation.  FBG  data  was  shown  to  correlate  well  with  the  strain  gage  data  for  the  different  temperatures and loading rates considered.  Due  to  the  woven  architecture  and  the  offaxis  orientation,  the  specimens  demonstrated  a  unique  fracture mechanism. These specimens underwent significant elongation prior to failure and experienced  necking  during  cyclic  loading.  The  presence  of  necking  in  PMCs  is  associated  with  failure  of  the  fiber matrix  interface  and  the  matrix;  these  failures  allow  fiber  bundles  to  rotate  from  a  45  to  a  shallower  angle with respect to the loading direction. The subsequent SEM analysis of surfaces and crosssectional  areas  captured  cracks  propagating  in  the  matrix  and  along  the  fibers  as  well  as  some  occurrences  of  debonding  and  delamination.  Fracture  mechanisms  were  similar  among  the  different  specimens  and  some  differences  were  associated  with  thermal  effects.  Comparison  between  failed  and  nonfailed  specimens indicated that the majority of the damage developed prior to failure.  In  order  to  evaluate  the  applicability  of  FBGs  for  damage  monitoring,  microscopic  observations  of  damage  development  in  these  specimens  were  correlated  with  results  from  the  FBG  spectral  analysis.   FBGs  have  shown  slight  chirping  that  was  presumably  caused  by  the  presence  of  matrix  and  bundle  cracks  on  the  surface  of  the  specimen.  In  the  case  of  damage  monitoring,  no  major  changes  of  the  spectrum,  which  could  have  been  related  to  a  tangible  change  in  the  specimen  damage  state,  were  observed.  Such  results  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  specimens  developed  relatively  low  amount  of  damage  with  the  exception  of  the  area  around  the  fracture  zone.  Since  fracture  occurred  relatively  far  from the FBGs, they did not react to it. When considering utilization of FBGs for damage monitoring, the  prevalent damage mechanism in that material as well as the location or positioning of the FBG(s) should  be  taken  into  account.  If  the  material  develops  minimal  damage  or  the  FBG  is  located  far  from  the  epicenter  (e.g.  delamination of central plies vs. surface bonded FBG), the sensor might be insensitive to  damage initiation and propagation.   On the contrary, some FBGs have exhibited significant chirping. However, further analysis of the spectral  shapes and the assessment of the specimen damage state suggested that distortion of the spectrum was  71   

not  a  reflection  of  damage.  It  is  proposed  that  poor  quality  of  the  bond  between  the  FBG  and  the  specimen  has  resulted  in  distortion  of  the  FBG  signal.  Additional  specimens  would  have  to  be  tested  in  order  to  uphold  or  dismiss  this  hypothesis.  These  results  emphasize  that  a  careful  assessment  of  the  damage  state  of  the  specimen  must  be  conducted  prior  to  reaching  a  verdict  on  the  cause  of  spectral  chirping or change.  During  fatigue  loading  the  specimens  have  demonstrated  strain  ratcheting.  The  degree  of  ratcheting  increased  with  temperature  due  to  degradation  of  mechanical  properties  of  the  BMI  matrix.  Overall,  FBG  data  correlated  well  with  the  strain  gage  data  at  RT  and  ET.  Strain  measurements  obtained  with  fully  bonded  and  partially  bonded  FBGs  were  also  in  agreement.  The  use  of  partially  bonded  FBGs  is  advantageous if a specimen is expected to develop a significant amount of damage that creates chirping  of a fully bonded sensor.   Overall,  FBGs  show  their  usability  for  strain  or  stiffness  monitoring  of  PMCs  at  ET.  However,  their  ability  to  provide  useful  information  regarding  the  damage  state  of  the  material  is  strongly  related  on  their  location and failure mechanism of the substrate material.

6 Discussion and Recommendations 
Fiber  Bragg  grating  sensors  are  perceived  as  attractive  means  for  strain  and  damage  monitoring  of  specimens  during  mechanical  testing  as  well  as  for  health  monitoring  of  inservice  components  [1218,  6776]. The experimental programs conducted as a part of this thesis further investigated applicability of  surface  bonded  and  embedded  FBGs  for  stiffness  and  damage  monitoring  of  woven  PMCs  during  tensiontension  fatigue  loading  at  different  temperatures.  However,  certain  limitations  pertaining  to  their use exist and have to be considered for future implementations. This chapter will merge the results  of the two experimental programs and will propose recommendations for application of FBG sensors for  strain and damage monitoring of woven laminates.  

6.1 Strain Measurement 
Results  of  both  experimental  programs  showed  that  FBG  sensors  can  be  used  for  strain  and  stiffness  monitoring. However, if the specimen is heavily damaged (Chapter 4), chirping of the FBG spectra will be  substantial  and  will  complicate  data  analysis.  When  dealing  with  a  chirped  spectrum  it  is  advisable  to  use  an  effective  Bragg  wavelength  instead  of  a  peak  Bragg  wavelength  for  strain  calculations,  as  it  was  discussed  in  Section  4.2.3.  Moreover,  partially  bonded  FBG  sensors  are  recommended  for  use  with  specimens  that  are  expected  to  exhibit  strong  strain  nonuniformities  that  lead  to  a  distortion  of  a  fully  bonded  FBG  spectrum.  Under  these  conditions,  partially  bonded  FBGs  offer  a  particular  advantage  over  the  fully  bonded  ones  as  they  are  not  susceptible  to  chirping  and  can  be  utilized  without  complicating  data  analysis  and  compromising  the  validity  of  strain  measurements.  In  Section  5.6.2  a  good  agreement  was  shown  between  the  strain  measurements  obtained  with  fully  and  partially  bonded  FBGs.  It  should  be noted that partially bonded FBGs cannot be used for compression testing. 

6.2 Damage Monitoring 
By  monitoring  the  changes  of  the  FBG  spectra,  it  was  possible  to  detect  the  transition  between  the  different stages of damage development in carbon/epoxy onaxis specimens (Section 4.4). In the case of  carbon/BMI  offaxis  specimens,  FBG  spectra  were  also  representative  of  the  damage  state  of  the  substrate;  however,  final  fracture  was  localized  and  FBGs  did  not  detect  or  signal  it  (Section  5.5).  In  general,  to  increase  the  sensitivity  of  an  FBG  sensor  to  damage  development,  the  sensor  should  be  placed  as  close  to  the  expected  site  of  damage  development  as  possible.  This  point  is  especially  important  if  damage  is  not  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  specimen.  Similarly,  if  damage  73   

development  in  the  material  is  not  uniform,  it  is  recommended  to  use  a  network  of  sensors  in  order  to  adequately  map  out  damage  distribution.  In  regards  to  damage  monitoring,  configuration  and  positioning  of  the  FBG  as  well  as  the  failure  mechanism  particular  to  that  substrate  have  to  be  considered as these parameters will determine effectiveness of the sensors.  For  damage  monitoring,  a  possible  alternative  to  a  uniform  FBG  would  be  a  chirped  grating.  In  the  case  of  a  uniform  FBG  the  pitch  (or  period)  of  the  grating  is  constant,  hence  resulting  in  a  single  wavelength  being  reflected,  refer  to  Figure  72a.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  chirped  grating  the  period  varies  linearly  along  the  length  of  the  grating,  resulting  in  a  range  of  wavelengths  being  reflected,  Figure  72b.  In  fact  there  is  a  direct  relationship  between  the  reflected  wavelengths  of  the  chirped  spectrum  and  the  locations  along  the  length  of  the  grating.  Thus  if  the  intensity  of  a  particular  wavelength  increases  or  decreases  (caused  by  a  nonuniform  strain  field)  it  is  possible  to  relate  this  event  to  the  precise  location  along  the  grating.  Previous  studies  [76]  have  shown  that  locations  of  cracks  correspond  to  the  locations  of  jumps  or  drops  in  the  spectrum,  Figure  72c.  Hence  chirped  FBG  can  potentially  provide  a  better  quantitative assessment of the crack formation on the material surface than uniform FBGs would.

6.3 Equipment SetUp 
Another  parameter  to  consider  when  using  FBG  sensors  is  the  equipment  and  the  setup  used  to  measure  Bragg  wavelengths  (i.e.  OSA  vs.  interrogator).  For  the  experimental  work  discussed  in  this  report, an OSA and an interrogator were used which are characteristically different pieces of equipment  and  have  their  own  benefits  and  limitations.  An  interrogator  has  a  maximum  sampling  frequency  of  250Hz  and  hence  can  be  used  for  insitu  strain  monitoring  during  cyclic  testing.  However,  it  does  not  capture  the  entire  spectrum  and  acts  as  a  black  box  by  recording  only  timestamped  wavelength  data.  On the contrary, an OSA captures the entire spectrum that can potentially be used for health monitoring  of  the  substrate  material  or  the  sensor  integrity  (e.g.  bond  quality).  As  it  was  shown  in  Chapter  4,  when  a specimen is substantially damaged and the signal from the sensor is severely distorted, the OSA data is  easier  to  analyze  and  is  more  meaningful  than  the  interrogator  data.  The  most  limiting  factor  of  an  OSA  is  the  time  required  to  scan  through  the  whole  spectrum.  Hence  it  is  cumbersome  to  use  an  OSA  for  measuring strain and capturing stiffness degradation. Overall, the choice regarding utilization of an OSA,  an  interrogator,  or  both  depends  on  the  objectives  for  the  application  of  FBGs  (i.e.  damage  or  strain  monitoring,  or  both)  and  the  expected  spectral  changes  throughout  their  lifetime.  In  general,  an  interrogator  is  recommended  for  strain  measurements  of  materials  that  develop  a  minimal  amount  of  damage (Chapter 5), whereas an OSA is recommended for damage monitoring and strain measurements  of heavily damaged materials (Chapter 4).  Nonetheless,  it  is  advantageous  to  employ  both  an  OSA  and  an  interrogator  during  initial  tests  of  a  new  experimental  program  in  order  to  evaluate  the  response  of  the  specimens  and  the  sensors,  and  to  formulate  the  test  protocol  accordingly.  These  tests  can  be  performed  in  conjunction  with  other  conventional  techniques  used  for  damage,  strain  or  temperature  monitoring  to  provide  a  complete  evaluation  and  calibration  of  FBGs.  If  chirping  occurs  when  the  interrogator  is  used  as  the  primary  device,  it  is  recommended  that  the  user  or  the  operator  examines  the  specimen  and  or  the  spectrum  (via an OSA) to identify the possible source of chirping and its severity.   Additionally,  an  alternative  setup  is  proposed  that  can  be  used  for  simultaneous  data  acquisition  with  an  OSA  and  an  interrogator,  as  shown  in  Figure  73.  In  this  arrangement  an  OSA  and  an  interrogator  are  connected to the opposite ends of the optical fiber, and the interrogator records the reflected spectrum,  and  the  OSA  records  the  transmitted  spectrum.  The  benefit  of  this  setup  is  that  equipment  does  not  have to be repeatedly disconnected and reconnected in order to take measurements. Hence wavelength  data  can  be  recorded  continuously  with  an  interrogator,  and  spectra  can  be  captured  with  an  OSA  75   

during  periodic  dwell  periods.  Moreover,  Prabhugoud  et  al.  [79]  wrote  an  interesting  paper  which  examined the selfdiagnostic capabilities of FBGs via the transmitted spectra.

6.4 Bonding 
Results  presented  in  Section  5.5  highlighted  an  important  concern  regarding  premature  debonding  of  surface mounted FBGs. The main difficulty in achieving a strong bond between a substrate and an FBG is  related  to  its  relatively  small  available  bonding  area.  If  an  issue  with  achieving  good  bond  integrity  arises,  it  is  suggested  to  consider  application  of  a  flat  cladding  OF.  This  type  of  optical  fibers  has  flat  sides  and  provides  a  larger  area  for  bonding,  Figure  74.  Li  et  al.  [12]  had  successfully  used  FBGs  written  on  a  flat  cladding  OF  to  characterize  fatigue  (R=1)  deformation  of  friction  stir  welded  aluminum  alloys  at high strain amplitudes (5000 ).

7 Conclusions and Future Work 
7.1 Conclusions 
Fiber  Bragg  grating  sensors  are  perceived  as  attractive  means  for  strain  and  damage  monitoring  of  specimens  during  mechanical  testing  as  well  as  for  health  monitoring  of  inservice  components.  The  experimental  programs  conducted  as  a  part  of  this  thesis  further  investigated  applicability  of  surface  bonded  and  embedded  FBGs  for  stiffness  and  damage  monitoring  of  woven  PMCs  during  tension tension  fatigue  loading  at  different  temperatures.  In  the  meanwhile,  the  influence  of  temperature  on  the behavior of offaxis specimens was also investigated.  Implementation  of  embedded  FBGs  for  monitoring  carbon/epoxy  onaxis  woven  laminates  has  shown  their sensitivity to damage initiation and propagation. During the early stages of fatigue, these laminates  developed  matrix  cracks  in  the  overlap  region  between  the  warp  and  the  weft  fibers  that  resulted  in  severe chirping of the spectra.  With further progression of cyclic loading, FBG spectrum was restored to  a  relatively  clean  shape.  The  proposed  explanation  of  this  change  was  debonding  of  the  sensor  due  to  delamination  of  the  plies.  In  fact,  final  failure  of  the  specimen  was  accompanied  by  complete  delamination  of  the  plies.  Moreover,  crosssectional  observation  of  a  nonfailed  specimen  showed  extensive  delamination.  Overall,  evolution  of  the  FBG  spectra  during  fatigue  was  coherent  with  the  development of damage in these laminates.   It  was  found  that  woven  specimens  exhibited  a  significant  reduction  of  stiffness  during  the  early  stages  of  fatigue  and  experienced  subtle  degradation  throughout  the  remainder  of  the  test.  FBGs  have  successfully  captured  this  trend.  However,  magnitudes  of  stiffness  degradation  measured  with  FBGs  were  not  in  precise  agreement  with  the  LVDT  data.  The  main  reason  for  this  discrepancy  was  the  misalignment  of  the  OF.  Results  thus  far  demonstrate  the  applicability  of  embedded  FBGs  for  stiffness  monitoring,  but  additional  work  is  required  to  assess  their  ability  to  accurately  capture  stiffness  degradation.  Fatigued offaxis woven specimens have demonstrated an interesting failure mechanism that resembled  necking  of  metallic  materials.  Microscopic  observations  of  surface  and  crosssectional  areas  have  revealed  the  presence  of  matrix  and  transverse  bundle  cracks,  and  debonding  and  delamination  between  the  bundles  of  the  same  and  adjacent  plies.  The  final  fracture  was  localized  and  FBGs  did  not  detect  it.  Nonetheless,  FBG  spectra  were  representative  of  the  damage  state  of  the  material  in  the  77   

vicinity  of  the  sensor.  Minimal  damage  was  observed  in  nonfailed  specimens  and  in  failed  specimens  in  regions  away  from  the  fracture  zone.  As  a  result,  the  surface  bonded  FBGs  have  chirped  only  slightly  in  response to matrix and bundle cracks.   Moreover, the offaxis specimens exhibited a nonlinear stressstrain response and demonstrated strong  temperature  dependence.  An  increase  in  test  temperature  has  led  to  a  reduction  of  stiffness,  has  increased  nonlinearity  and  has  promoted  strain  ratcheting.  The  timedependent  behavior  (e.g.  stress  relaxation)  of  the  material  was  also  evident  at  elevated  temperatures.  Overall,  measurements  made  with  FBG  sensors  were  in  good  agreement  with  the  strain  gage  data,  and  the  sensors  themselves  possessed a significantly longer fatigue life than strain gages.  In  conclusion,  results  of  the  experimental  work  presented  in  this  thesis  show  the  applicability  of  FBG  sensors  for  damage  and  stiffness  monitoring  of  textile  PMCs  during  tensiontension  fatigue  at  temperatures  up  to  200C.  They  also  show  potential  for  becoming  the  sensor  of  choice  for  insitu  structural health monitoring of components and parts made from PMCs.  

7.2 Future Work 
The  future  work  will  entail  additional  testing  of  PMCs  at  elevated  temperatures  with  the  application  of  FBG  sensors  for  fatigue  monitoring.  These  tests  will  be  focused  on  finetuning  the  methodology  used  with  FBGs,  and  on  characterizing  fatigue  behavior  of  PMCs  at  ET.  One  series  of  tests  will  be  performed  with  onaxis  woven  BMI  specimens  with  the  aim  to  investigate  the  effect  of  frequency  on  the  fatigue  performance  of  these  specimens  at  ET.  These  tests  will  contribute  to  a  comparison  of  failure  mechanisms  between  onaxis  and  offaxis  specimens  cut  from  the  same  laminate.  Another  set  of  tests  will  involve  carbon/MVK10  braided  PMCs  and  their  fatigue  properties  will  be  evaluated  at  different  temperatures  (up  to  300C)  and  frequencies.  Future  tests  will  be  performed  in  an  environmental  chamber,  which  was  recently  purchased,  and  will  eliminate  issues  with  temperature  gradients  along  the  length of the specimen. Also, utilization of flatcladding FBGs and an alternative OSAinterrogator setup  (Figure 73) will be considered.
