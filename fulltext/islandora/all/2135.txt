A bstract
Optimal control policies are determined for the free radical polymerization of three different polymerization processes, in a non-isothermal batch reactor as follows: 1. B ulk polymerization o f n-butyl methacrylate 2. Solution polymerization o f m ethyl methacrylate with monofunctional initiator 3. Solution polymerization o f m ethyl methacrylate with bifunctional initiator Four different optimal control objectives are realized for the above three processes. The ob jectives are: (i) maximization of monomer conversion in a specified operation time, (ii) min imization of operation time for a specified, final monomer conversion, (iii) maximization of monomer conversion for a specified, final number average polymer molecular weight, and (iv) maximization of monomer conversion for a specified, final weight average polymer molec ular weight. The realization of these objectives is expected to be very useful for the batch production of polymers. To realize the above four different optimal control objectives, a genetic algorithmsbased optimal control method is applied, and the tem perature of heat-exchange fluid inside reactor jacket is used as a control function. Necessary equations are j>rovided in the above three processes to suitably transform the process model in the range of a specified variable other than time, and to evaluate the elements of jacobian to help in the accurate solution of the process model. The results of this optimal control application reveal considerable improvements in the performance of the batch polymerization processes.

Introduction

Optimal control is an optimization of function (s) not variables. In general, I lie optimal con trol of process denotes ofi' -line determ ination of optimization function(s), the online api^lication of which would achieve a desired objective. The application of optimization function(s) in optimal control provides extreme flexibility and enhanced capabilities to realize process objectives with greater performance. Together with the increase in computing power, and the development of more efficient optimal control techniques, research in the optimal control of industrial processes has begun to gain prominence. Conventionally to flnd the optimal policies for a process, techniques based on the calculus of variation, dynamic programming, and nonlinear programming are avaiiai)ie. Determin ing optimal control with nonlinear programming becomes very difficult, when the system becomes very complex to solve. In dynamic programming, the dimensionality becomes pro hibitively large even with modestly sized problem. Techniques based on Variational calculus are prone to be erroneous while solving the derivatives. In this work, a new robust genetic algorithm based optimal control technique, developed by Upreti [2004], is used to determine four different optimal control objectives to obtain minimization of operation time and maximization of monomer conversion in a non-isothermal batch reactor, under different specifications. These objectives have been developed and

realized for the following three different polymerization processes: 1. Bulk polymerization of n-butyl m ethacrylate (BMA) in a non-isothermal batch reactor [Upreti and Sundaram, 2004b] 2. Solution polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) with monofunctional initiator in a non-isothermal batch reactor [Sundaram and Upreti, 2004] 3. Solution polymerization of MMA with bifunctional initiator in a non-isothermal batch reactor [Upreti and Sundaram, 2004a] 3

O ptim al Control

The objective of optimal control is to determine the optimal control policy th at will cause ^ process to satisfy the physical constraints and at the same time minimize (or maximize) some performance criterion [Kirk, 1970]. Optimal control is applicable in many areas. In industrial practice, determining optimal con trol policies are usually performed by trial and error experience. There has been significant research in the last decade to develop efficient optimal control techniques that would ensure Ifigh standards of product quality and operational safety with the minimal production costs [Upreti, 2004]. In the optimal control of a process, an optimization parameter is a function of an indepen dent variable. Optimal control implies off-line determination of optimization function(s), the f'nline application of which would achieve a desired objective. It is the application of opti*nization function(s), as opposed to optimization variable(s), which offers extreme flexibility ^nd enhanced capabilities to realize process objectives with superior performance. Optimal control techniques are based on variational calculus using Pontryagin's maximum minimum principle [Pontryagin et al., 1962], dynamic programming [Luus, 1990], nonJmear programming [Biegler et al., 2002], and search methods [Luus and Hennessy, 1999, Oupta, 1995, Lee et al., 1997, 1999, Wang and Chiou, 1997]. I^ecently, Upreti [2004] developed a new robust genetic algorithm based optimal control technique. This optimal control method iteratively uses the three genetic operations of selection, crossover and m utation in the size-varying domain of control function with logarithmic and ^mear mappings. The method does not require any input of feasible control solution, or any Auxiliary condition. Selection stochastically picks control functions from their population on the basis of performance index or "fitness" . A control function with better fitness has a Sweater probability to populate a new set of control functions. Crossover works on the new set

1.2 Goijctic Algorithm based Optimal Control Technique
or population, which has a greater representation of control functions with better fitnesses. Crossover recombines the building blocks of these control functions, which are represented through binary digits, or bits. This operation results in a newer population of "children" , some of which are likely to be better than their "parents" . Finally, m utation changes the bits of children with a very low probability, and is equivalent to a local search for the control functions of even b etter fitnesses. This method has been successfully applied earlier for the optimal control of ethylene polymerization in an industrial tubular reactor [Yao et al., 2004].

Upreti [2004] explained this technique in detail for a general proce.ss model, which has been explained here for a non-isothermal batch polymer reactor model. To define optimal control, let us consider a batch polymer reactor with a simple process model equation, ^ = f {x( t ) , u(t ) ), 0<t<t, (1.1)

in Equation (1.1), x{t) is a state vector [n x 1] and u{t) is a control vector [m x 1], and both are functions of time, t, over a given process operation time t/. In a non-iso(hermal batch polymer reactor, x{t) is a vector of state variables, which arc volume and tem perature of reactants, the concentrations of monomer, initiator, solvent, inhibitor, and of the moments of radicals, dead polymer molecules. u{t) is a control function within some speci.fied bounds. Here, we consider jacket tem perature (Tj) as a control function. Let us impose two inequality constraints [g{x{t), u{t))] on the reactor and the jacket tem peratures of the above batch process model. Inequality constraint on the jacket ternperatuie
(Tj) is as follows

7j,,i,,(() < 7j(i) <

optimal control function, which would optimize a given performance index J . Here, we consider optimal performance index J is either maximization of monomer conversion or minimization of batch operation time. Rector tem perature places a vital role to get

Ihis optimum result, and is a key param eter to control monomer conversion and the batch operation time. In the heat transfer (non-isothermal) model, monomer conversion and the hatch operation time are concerned to jacket temperature. Moreover, monomer conversion and the batch operation time are the sign to estimate process efficiency for an assigned product. The discrete step values of 7j(t), equispaced over process operation time, are considered as optimization variables. These step values form a control vector T j(t). is the number of control stages of step values for control function 7](t). This new robust technique [Upreti, 2004] is applied on a problem by randomly initializing a mean control vnlue Tj. for a given number of control stages, i = 0,1,....A^-1 At any ith stage, the step value of control, T,., is calculable from mean control value Tj.^, and ^ hinary-coded deviation AT}. , by means of some mapping. Tj., Tj., A T j., can be written in Hie vector form as Tj, Tj, ATj^ respectively for the Nu stages. In addition to mean control value Tj, a population of A T j, is also randomly generated. The presented technique uses the mapping to relate a binary-coded deviation value (AT}. ^) and mean value {Tj.) to a control value {Tj.) by providing an optimal control vector T j(t) corre sponding to each binary coded deviation vector AT^j in its population. To generate optimal 6

1.2 Genetic Algorithm based Optimal Control Technique control vector T j(t), the genetic operation of selection, cross-over, and m utation are suc cessively applied to the population of binary-coded deviation vector A T jj. There are two different mappings employed in this study: Logarithmic mapping emphasizes the relative order of magnitudes of control values at dif ferent stages during the initial iterations. It provides the step value, Tj.= b^'. where, h is the logarithmic base, which can be expressed as
b ~

( f -4)

In Equation (1.4), b is the logarithmic base, and Ij.max and 2],min are the maximum and minimum values of control function 7j(t). and Pi is from y, = log^ f,, + D is the variable of control domain between (1.5) the limits of Dmin > 0and b, and AVit is the

number of bits specifiedto represent any ith element ofATj^ i.e. AT}.;. Linear mapping used to refine an optimal control solution straightforward after the initial iteration. This mapping is generally given by

The property combined logarithmic and linear mapping leads to an efficient search of robust control solutions in a large control domain with a very low value of A^it-

O ptim al Control o f B atch P olym erization in a N onisotherm al B atch R eactor

Polymerization in batch reactors is carried out extensively in polymer industry because of its operational simplicity, and production adaptability. During batch polymerization, process variables undergo significant changes with time. The optimal performance of this process is determ inable by optimizing an objective function subject to process and safety constraints under time-varying conditions. The determ ination of optimization parameters requires the satisfaction of a differential-algebraic process model. Because the efficiency of batch reactors, and their product properties are strong functions of reaction tem perature, its optimal determination has received a lot of attention since the early works of Denbigh [1958], and Aris [I960]. Such a determination guides as to how a control function should change with time in order to achieve a desired objective. Moreover, this determ ination provides valuable information on the design of reactor, and the upper limits to its expected performance. This advantage has been the m ajor source of motivation for many optimal control studies on batch reactors [Luus and Okongwu, 1999, Logsdon and Biegler, 1993, Luus, 1994, Bojkov and Luus, 1996, Hicks et ah, 1969, Chen and Huang, 198.1, Thomas and Kiparissides, 1984, Louie et ah, 1985, Ponnuswarny et ah, 1987, Hsu and Chen, 1988, O 'Driscoll et ah, 1989, O 'Driscoll and Ponnuswarny, 1990.

Poly (n-Butyl Methacrylate) or PBMA, is an im portant polymer used in paint industry as a resin in coating, has the property of strikingly good resistance to weathering and gloss retention. After an extensive literature survey on the free radical polymerization (FRP) of methacrylates, we found th a t no work has been done on the optimal control of n-Butyl M ethacrylate (BMA) polymerization. In this work, the optimal control of free radical, bulk polymerization of n-Butyl M ethacry late is implemented in a non-isothermal batch reactor using monofunctional 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator. Four optimal control objectives (Section 1.4) are for mulated based on the detailed process model (Refer Chapter 2). A robust optimal control method based on genetic algorithms [Upreti, 2004] is used to determine 0 ])timal control policies.

Both of these objectives were con strained by specified, final monomer concentration and number average polymer molecular weight. Although experimental results generally agreed with optimal control predictions, discrepancies in number average polymer molecular weights were observed, which indicate the lim itations of the polymerization model used to simplify the mathematical framework required for optim al control. There have been a couple of optimal control studies on batch MMA polymerization using innovative approaches. Chang and Lai [1992] proposed a two-step method for optimal con trol, which first calculates instantaneous values of number average degree of polymerization based on a final specification, and then uses them in a steady state model to compute con trol function values with nonlinear programming. They applied this method for the optimal control of MMA polymerization in a batch reactor for specified final monomer conversion, number average degree of polymerization, and polydispersity. Tian et al. [2001] used neu ral networks to generate optimal tem perature policy for specified number average molecular weight, monomer conversion, and polydispersity for a batch MMA polymerization reactor. In this work, the optimal control of free radical MMA polymerization is implemented in a nonisothermal batch reactor using a rigorous unsteady state model. A robust optirrial control method based on genetic algorithms [Upreti, 2004] is used to determine optimal control policies. Benzene is used as a solvent, and benzoyl peroxide is used as a monofunctional initiator. Four optimal control objectives (Section 1.4) are formulated based on the detailed process model (Refer C hapter 4).

Bifunctional initiator is very useful in obtaining high initiation rates, and high polymer molecular weights [Simionescu et al., 1990]. After an extensive literature survey on the optimal control studies of methyl methacry late polymerization in a batch reactor, we found th a t no work has been done on the optimal control of MMA polymerization with bifunctional initiator. Whereas, we found very few pub lication on the free radical polymerization of MMA with bifunctional initiator [Simionescu Gt al., 1990, 1988, Subramanian and Kapur, 1958], which convey the kinetic study of MMA polymerization with bifunctional initiator. In this work, we initially consider free radical polymerization of methyl m ethacrylate with benzene solvent is carried out in a batch reactor by using bifunctional initiator. Four optimal Control objectives (Section 1.4) are formulated based on the detailed process model (Refer Chapter 6) determine the optimal control of free radical, solution polymerization of MMA with a t>llunctional initiator using a detailed unsteady state process model. A robust optimal control method based on genetic algorithms [Upreti, 2004] is used to determine optimal control policies. Benzene is used as a solvent, and N,N'-bis[(4-t-butylazo-4-cyanovaleryl)oxyethyl]%0-bis-formamide is used as a bifunctional initiator. We consider this bifunctional initiator ·s chemically and thermally symmetrical and hence, both peroxide groups decompose at the same rate. Thermal symmetry literally means that both peroxide groups decompose at the Same rate whether the peroxide groups are alike or not [Dhib et al., 2000].

O ptim al Control of P B M A

The mathem atical model of bulk, batch polymerization reactor is highly non-linear. Furtheroiore, due to the inequality constraints of Equation (2.14) and (2.15), the relation between Ihe performance index and jacket tem perature for Objectives 1-4 would not necessarily be ^nimodal and continuous for the four optimal control objectives. To realize these difficult objectives, a robust optimal control method based on genetic algorithms [Upreti, 2004] was applied. this work, the tem perature of heat-exchange fluid inside reactor jacket (or jacket tem  perature) was employed as a control function of specified independent variable.
26 .

Jacket

2.5 Optimal Control of PB M A tem perature was considered to be a series of five discrete step values equispaced in the range of independent variable. The number of step values (or control stages), the m athematical model of bulk, batch polymerization reactor with its param eters, and the process constraints of Equations (2.14) and (2.15) were input to the optimal control method. These inputs are needed to evaluate the performance index (fitness) for a given control function. The appli cation of the method yielded the optimal control function by stochastically applying genetic operations on a randomly generated set (population) of control functions constrained by Equation (2.15). Since the method generates optimal control functions within the control domain, the constraints of Equation (2.15) are satisfied automatically. The method elimi nates any control function for which any other process constraint (Equation (2.14) in this application) is violated during the evaluation of corresponding performance index.

To realize this objective, monomer conversion in batch polymerization was maximized in the specified processing tim e of 70 min. The optimal control policy for jacket tem perature (i- e. optimal jacket tem perature versus time) is presented in Figure 3.1. It is observed th at optimal jacket tem perature is close to its upper reactor tem perature limit of 90°C. The figure shows the evolution of jacket tem perature from a random series of step values nf jacket tem perature to its optimal level as the iterations of the optimal control method continue. Final monomer conversion progressively increases, and corresponding to optimal jacket tem perature, the optim al value of the conversion is 36.5%, which is an improvement cf 43% over th at in base case. figure 3.2 shows the change in optimal reactor tem perature and monomer conversion with «me, which correspond to the application of optimal jacket tem perature shown in Figure 3.1. Corresponding variables for base case are also shown in Figure 3.2. It is observed th at optimal reactor tem perature after the first control stage is in phase with optimal jacket tem perature, ^vhich indicates its strong influence on reaction tem perature. At all times, optimal reactor tem perature is well within the upper limit of 90°C specified through Equation (2.14). For time greater than zero, the optimal value of reactor tem perature is found to exceed th at base case. It is this higher value corresponding to optimal jacket tem perature which is primarily responsible for increased reaction rates, and subsequently, higher monomer con30

version. In fact, as seen in Figure 3.2, optimal monomer conversion, for time greater than zero, is always higher than the monomer conversion for base case. The optim al values of number and weight average polymer molecular weights (Mn and Mw) are respectively shown in Figure 3.3 and 3.4 along with those for base case. It is observed th a t the initial rate of increase of optimal Mn as well as Mw with time is significantly higher and more prolonged than th at in base case. In comparison to base case, the final values of optimal Mn and Mw are higher by about 40% and 43%, respectively. This increase suggests th a t high optimal reactor tem perature under the present unsteady state conditions favors the generation of polymer molecules with longer chain lengths. In fact, this departure in the values of average polymer molecular weights from base case motivated the formulation of Objectives 3 and 4, which target the maximization of monomer conversion with specified, final Mn and Mw, respectively.

To realize this objective, the operation time of batch polymerization was minimized for the specified, final monomer conversion of 40%. The optimal control policy for jacket temperature is presented in Figure 3.5. Optimal jacket tem perature is close to its upper reactor tem perature limit of 90°C, similar to what was observed for Objective 1. Moreover, the time-averaged value of optimal jacket tem perature is approximately same as that in case of Objective 1. This similarity of optimal jacket tem perature is reasonable because the attain*^ent of each of Objectives 1 and 2 demands th at the overall rate of monomer conversion be Maximized through jacket tem perature. Optimal reactor tem perature, shown in Figure 3.6, closely follows optimal jacket tem perature second control stage onward. This behavior was observed earlier in case of Objective 1. Oorresponding to optimal jacket tem perature, the optimal value of the operation time is ^9-1 min, which is a reduction by 34% relative to that of base case.

The reason is th at corresponding optimal reactor and jacket tem peratures for Objective 1 and 2 are not much different, and are close to their upper limit.

For base case with the constant reactor tem perature of 60°C, the time needed to achieve this value of is about 22 min with 7.8% monomer conversion as seen in Figures 3.3 increases with a decrease

constant reactor tem perature of 60°C, the time needed to achieve this value of

7 min with 1.5% monomer conversion as seen in Figures 3.4 and 3.2, respectively. During th at short time, the rate of change of with time is about an order of magnitude higher

than th at for Afn. As a result, the realization of the present optimal control objective with high monomer conversions is expected to be very challenging. Optimal control results for this objective were obtained for the same initial reactor tem perature, and the lower limit of jacket tem perature that were used for Objective 3. 35

Figure 3.5 shows the resulting optimal jacket tem perature versus time which spans only 13.9 mill of operation time, and yields a final monomer conversion, which although is an improvement by 100% over base case, is still a low value of 3%. It is observed th at the second und third control stages of jacket tem perature are of small durations (less than a minute each) ^ ith values 4.6 and -2 0 °C respectively. The reason is that jacket tem perature is equispaced over the range of M^, which has a very high initial rate of change with time, especially during Ihe second and third control stages. The variation in optimal jacket tem perature with time is however analogous to th at in case of Objective 3. After an initial decline, optimal jacket temperature climbs up with time, and is closely followed by corresponding optimal reactor tem perature as seen in Figure 3.6. The rates of change of optimal M,, (Figure 3.3) and optimal (Figure 3.4) are initially not much different than those in base case, indicating

the severe limitation of short time available for optimal control.

Genetic algorithm-based optim al control technique was coded in C+-t- language. The re producibility of the results of the technique was established by running it on five different computers, and two different compilers (Microsoft Visual C + + 6.0, and Microsoft Visual Studio. Net). The reported result of this study were obtained using two different Dell com puters (Pentium IV w ith 1 GB RAM, 3.06 GHz processor speed, and Pentium IV with 512 GB RAM, 2.80 GHz processor speed) Objective 1 took nearly two hours to compute, which was the least com putation time in the four objectives. Whereas, Objective 2 took nearly 46 hours, which was the highest com putation time. Objective 3 and 4 took approximately 5 and 13 hours respectively to compute.

C onclusion

Four optim al control objectives were developed for a bulk polymerization in a batch reactor based on a detailed non-isothermal process model. The objectives were: (i) maximization of monomer conversion in a specified operation time, (ii) minimization of operation time for specified, final monomer conversion, (iii) maximization of monomer conversion for a specified, final number average polymer molecular weight, and (vi) maximization of monomer conversion for a specified, final weight average polymer molecular weight. The tem perature of heat-exchange fluid inside reactor jacket was employed as a control function of a specified independent variable. The process constraints of maximum reactor tem perature, and the upper and lower limits to the heat-exchange fluid were imposed. The above objectives were designed to help augment operational efficiency, and achieve a higher degree of product specificity in polymer production. Equations were provided to suitably transform the process model in the range of specified variable other than time, and to 37

Mathematical Modeling for Solution, Batch MMA Polymerization With Monofunctional Initiator

Further, we discuss the formulation of four different optimal control objectives, and the development of analytical jacobian to integrate the developed model.

Based on the above m athem atical model, four different optimal control objectives for batch MMA polymerization are formulated in this section. The tem perature of heat-exchange fluid in reactor jacket (or "jacket tem perature") is considered as a control function of a specified param eter. An inequality constraint in the form of an upper limit to the tem perature of reactants is imposed as T < (4.2%)

The four optimal control objectives described above require the integration of batch process «^odel with different independent variables (t, m, A?n and A?w) for performance index eval uations. These equations are highly non-linear, and stiff to integrate. In this work, they '''ere numerically integrated using semi-implicit Bader-Deuflhard algorithm, and adaptive step-size control [Press et al., 2002]. Analytical jacobians were employed for integration. The equations to evaluate the elements of jacobian corresponding to each optimal control objective are provided in the next section. 48

4.7

O ptim al Control of P M M A w ith M onofunctional Initiator

The mathem atical model for the batch polymerization of MMA is highly non-linear. Further more, due to the inequality constraints of Equation (4.27) and (4.28), the relation between the performance index and jacket tem perature for Objectives 1-4 would not necessarily be unimodal and continuous for the four optimal control objectives. To realize these difficult objectives, a robust optimal control method based on genetic algorithms [Upreti, 2004] was applied. In this work, the tem perature of heat-exchange fluid inside reactor jacket (or jacket tem per ature) was employed as a control function of specified independent variable. Jacket tem per ature was considered to be a series of five discrete step values equispaced in the range of independent variable. The number of step values (or control stages), the m athematical model of MMA polymerization in a batch reactor with its parameters, and the process constraints of Equations (4.27). and (4.28) were input to the optimal control method. These inputs are needed to evaluate the performance index (fitness) for a given control function. The application of th e method yielded the optimal control function by stochastically applying genetic operations on a randomly generated set (population) of control functions constrained ky Equation (4.28). Since the method generates optimal control functions within the control domain, the constraints of Equation (4.28) are satisfied automatically. The method elimi nates any control function for which any other process constraint (Equation (4.27) in this application) is violated during the evaluation of corresponding performance index.

The optimal jacket tem perature policy was determined, which maximizes monomer (MMA) conversion during the specified batch polymerization time of 100 min. Figure 5.1 shows the optimal policy, which maximizes final monomer conversion to 65.2%. This value is 57.8% higher than the monomer conversion in base case. The figure also shows how the tem perature policy gets improved with the iterations of the optimal control method. It is observed th at the optimal policy reaches close to the maximum allowable reactor tem perature of 80°C. Figure 5.2 shows the change in optimal reactor tem perature, and monomer conversion with time, which correspond to the application of optimal jacket tem perature policy. Correspond ing variables for base case are also shown in the figure. It is observed th a t optimal reactor tem perature after the first control stage is close to its upper limit of 80°C. This fact indicates th a t high reaction tem peratures are needed in all control stages in order to increase overall polymerization, and achieve high monomer conversion. Optimal reactor tem perature after the first control stage is found to be in phase with optimal jacket tem perature (Figure 5.1). This behavior shows the strong influence of jacket tem perature on reaction tem perature, and explains why optimal jacket tem perature does not surpass the upper limit of reactor tem perature. At all times, optimal reactor tem perature is well within th a t limit, which is specified through Equation (4.27). For time greater than zero, the optimal value of reactor 57

tem perature exceeds th at for base case. Correspondingly, optimal monomer conversion, for time greater than zero, is always higher than the monomer conversion for base case. The optimal number and weight average polymer molecular weights (M,, and M^,) versus time are respectively shown in Figure 5.3 and 5.4 along with those for base case. It is observed that optimal M,, as well as My, values are always lower than respectively those in base case. In comparison to base case, the final values of optimal M ,, and My, are reduced by about 45% and 41%, respectively. This reduction suggests th at optimal reactor tem perature, which is higher than the reactor tem perature in base case, has favored the generation of polymer molecules with smaller chain lengths.

optimal policy is again close to the maximum allowable reactor tem perature of 80°C; similar to what was observed for Objective 1 . Moreover, the time-averaged value of optimal jacket tem perature is approximately same as th at in case of Objective 1 . This similarity of opti mal jacket tem perature is reasonable because the realization of each of Objectives 1 and 2 requires the maximization of the overall rate of monomer conversion. Optimal reactor tem perature, shown in Figure 5.7, closely follows optimal jacket tem perature after the first control stage. This behavior was observed earlier in case of Objective 1.

Corresponding to optimal jacket tem perature, the optimal value of the operation time is 114.6 min, which is a reduction by 47% relative to that of base case. Optimal monomer conversion is shown in Figure 5.6. It is observed to always higher than th at for base case. The optimal number and weight average polymer molecular weights (M. and M .) are respectively shown in Figure 5.3 and 5.4. The changes in monomer conversion, and average molecular weights with time almost coincide with respectively those in case of 59

The optimal jacket tem perature policy was determined, which maximizes monomer (MMA) conversion for the specified, final number average molecular weight, M,,,f = 10^. It may be noted that, as seen in Figure 5.3, this high value of is not achievable in base case.

In general, the time needed to obtain polymer of a specified M,,,f increases with a decrease in reaction tem perature. To provide extended application time for optimal control through jacket tem perature, and to facilitate higher monomer conversion during th at time, the initial tem perature of reactor was set at a low value of 0 C. Furthermore, wider range (for lower values) was made available to jacket tem perature by reducing its lower limit to - 2 0 °C.

O ptim al jacket tem perature almost reaches its upper limit of 120°C in the second control stage after which the tem perature decreases in the following control stages. It is noticed th at the second control stage is of short duration. The reason is th at control stages are equispaced over the specified independent variable, M,,, which undergoes a rapid increase with time at the onset of the second control stage (see Figure 5.3). The trend of optimal jacket tem perature after the first control stage is closely followed by corresponding optimal reactor tem perature as seen in Figure 5.7. While lower, initial reactor tem perature obviates the early attainm ent of M,,,f with low monomer conversion, higher reactor tem peratures later on boost the final monomer conversion. Due to low, initial reactor tem perature, the optimal values of (Figure 5.3) and Mw

(Figure 5.4) are small, and increase slowly with time. For time less than 67.2 min, the

to rise. Relative to optimal M,,, optimal Mw is observed to be much more sensitive to the tem perature rise. While the average change of optimal monomer conversion with time does not vary much later on with the stagewise drop of reaction tem perature, the changes in optimal Mn and My, with time are smaller compared to those in the second control stage.

tem perature, and the lower limit of jacket tem perature that were used for Objective 3. The realization of the present optimal control objective with high monomer conversions is more difBcult than the previous one because the change in with tim e is significantly higher

than th at of M ,. This results in polymerization that meets the specification of M .,t very quickly, thereby reducing the time available for optimal control through jacket temperature. Figure 5.5 shows the resulting optimal Jacket tem perature versus tim e which spans 912.5 min of operation time, and yields a final monomer conversion of 3 4 .7 %. This value is lower than th at for the last objective. The variation in optimal jacket tem perature with time is similar to that in case of Objective 3. After an initial increase in the second control stage, the tem perature decreases in the following stages, and is closely followed by corresponding optimal reactor tem perature as seen in Figure 5.7. Optimal M,, (Figure 5 .3 ), M . (Figure 5 .4 ), and monomer conversion (Figure 5.6) show perceptible growth after 7 min due to the higher tem perature of the second control stage.

The optimal control of MMA polymerization in a nonisothermal batch reactor was imple mented. The following four optimal control objectives were realized: (i) maximization of ^bouonier conversion in a specified operation time, (ii) minimization of operation time for specified, final monomer conversion, (iii) maximization of monomer conversion for a spec ified, final number average polymer molecular weight, and (vi) maximization of monomer

5.3 Conclusion - Optimal control o f PM M A with m onofunctional initiator conversion for a specified, final weight average polymer molecular weight. The tem perature of heat-exchange fluid in jacket of reactor was utilized as a control function of a specified independent variable. The process constraints were maximum reactor tem perature, and the upper and lower limits to the heat-exchange fluid. The above objectives were formulated to help provide wider choices for polymer production simultaneously with the optimum efficiency of operation. Equations were provided to suit ably transform the model of batch MMA polymerization in the range of specified variable other than time, and to evaluate the elements of jacobian. Based on the model, the four optim al control objectives were realized using a robust method based on genetic algorithms. The results of optimal control showed significant performance improvements compared to base case without optimal control. The specification of weight average molecular weight (ii?w) yielded lower monomer conversion than th a t with the specification of number average molecular weight (M,,). The possible reason is the higher rate of change of than M,,,

which cuts down the tim e available for optimal control. Initially, the changes in both and Mw with time were very high leading to shortening of the second control stage.

O ptim al Control O bjectives

Based on the above mathem atical model, four different optimal control objectives for batch MMA polymerization are formulated in this section. The tem perature of heat-exchange fluid in reactor jacket (or "jacket tem perature" ) is considered as a control function of a specified param eter. An inequality constraint in the form of an upper limit to the tem perature of reactants is enforced as T <
Tmax

(6.36)

There are two additional inequality constraints in the form of lower and upper limits to jacket tem perature, i.e., ^,min ^ ^ ^ ^,tnax (6.37)

The four optim al control objectives described above require the integration of corresponding equations of change with different independent variables {t, m, M,, and Mw) for performance index evaluations. These equations are very stiff and non-linear. In this work, they were nu merically integrated using semi-implicit Bader-Deuflhard algorithm, and adaptive step-size control [Press et al., 2 0 0 2 ]. Analytical jacobians were employed for integration. The equa tions to evaluate the elements of jacobian corresponding to each optimal control objective are provided in the next section.

(6.73)

For the integration of equations of change for Objectives 3 and 4, (x° was adjusted so th at the difference between value of independent variable (e.g.

ii?,, or M ^), and th a t calculated using

other state variables (e. g. from Equation (6.45) or (6.50)) is negligible. For Objectives 2 4, the transform ation of process model was done as soon as the new independent variable achieved a finite value lying within the first stage of optimal control. Various param eters used in calculations are provided in Table 6 . 1 . The gel effect models for propagation and termination rate coefficients are provided in sections 6.3 and 6.4, respec tively. The reactants for polymerization are the MMA (monomer), N,N'-bis[(4-t-butylazo4 -cyanovaleryl)oxyethyl]-azo-bis-formamide

(bifunctional initiator), benzene (solvent), and

trace am ount of some impurity (inhibitor). The product is the polymer, poly(MMA). No experimental data are available for the free radical polymerization of MMA using bifunc tional initiator. As such, we will compare the results of optimal control with the base case simulation of batch MMA polymerization with bifunctional initiator at a constant reaction tem perature of 70° C.

O ptim al Control o f P M M A w ith B ifunctional Ini tiator

The m athem atical model for the batch polymerization of MMA is highly non-linear. Further more, due to the inequality constraints of Equation (6.36) and (6.37), the relation between the performance index and jacket tem perature for Objectives 1-4 would not necessarily be unimodal and continuous for the four optimal control objectives. To realize these difficult 84

6.7 Optimal Control of PM M A w ith Bifunctional Initiator__________________________ objectives, a robust optimal control method based on genetic algorithms [Upreti, 2004] was applied. In this work, the tem perature of heat-exchange fluid inside reactor jacket (or jacket tem per ature) was employed as a control function of specified independent variable. Jacket tem per ature was considered to be a series of five discrete step values equispaced in the range of independent variable. The number of step values (or control stages), the m athem atical model of MMA polymerization in a batch reactor with its parameters, and the process constraints of Equations (6.36) and (6.37) were input to the optimal control method. These inputs are needed to evaluate the performance index (fitness) for a given control function. The application of the m ethod yielded the optimal control function by stochastically applying genetic operations on a randomly generated set (population) of control functions constrained by Equation (6.37). Since the method generates optimal control functions within the control domain, the constraints of Equation (6.37) are satisfied automatically. The method elimi nates any control function for which any other process constraint (Equation (6.36) in this application) is violated during the evaluation of corresponding performance index.

Results for Solution, Batch MMA Polymer ization with Bifunctional Initiator

The optim al control results for the four objectives are summarized and compared with the base case in Table 7.1. Note th at the specified values of average polymer molecular weights in Objectives 3 and 4 are not attainable in base case.

R e s u lts For O b je c tiv e 1

The optimal jacket tem perature policy was determined, which maximizesfinalmonomer (MMA) conversion during the specified batch polymerization time of 100 min.Figure
7.1

shows the optimal policy, which maximizes final monomer conversion to 85.6%. This value is 30% higher than the monomer conversion in base case. The figure also shows how the tem perature policy gets improved with the iterations of the optimal control method. It is observed th a t the optimal policy reaches close to the maximum allowable reactor tem perature of 80°C. Figure 7 .2 shows the change in optimal reactor tem perature, and monomer conversion with time, which correspond to. the optimal jacket tem perature policy. Corresponding variables for base case are also shown in the figure. It is observed th at optimal reactor tem perature increases very quickly, and gets close to its upper limit of 80° C in less than 10 min. In the fol lowing time, the tem perature is observed to be in phase with the optimal jacket tem perature (Figure 7 . 1 ) in the lower vicinity of its upper limit. This fact indicates th a t high reaction tem peratures are needed in all control stages in order to increase overall polymerization, and achieve high monomer conversion. This behavior shows the strong influence of jacket tem perature on reaction tem perature, and explains why optimal jacket tem perature does not surpass the upper limit of reactor tem perature. At all times, optimal reactor tem perature 88

Correspondingly, optimal monomer conversion, for time greater than zero, is always higher than the monomer conversion for base case. The optimal number and weight average polymer molecular weights (M,, and M^) versus time are respectively shown in Figure 7.3 and 7.4 along with those for base case. It is observed that optimal A/n well as values are always lower than respectively those in base case. and are reduced by about

R e s u lts For O b je c tiv e 2

The optimal jacket tem perature policy was determined, which minimizes batch polymer ization time for the specified, final monomer conversion of 70%. Shown in Figure 7.5, the optimal policy is again close to the maximum allowable reactor tem perature of 80°C; similar to what was observed for Objective 1. Moreover, the time-averaged value of optimal jacket tem perature is approximately same as that in case of Objective 1. This similarity of opti mal jacket tem perature is reasonable because the realization of each of Objectives 1 and 2 requires the maximization of overall rate of monomer conversion. Optim al reactor tem perature, shown in Figure 7.7, closely follows optimal jacket tem perature after the first control stage. This behavior was observed earlier in case of Objective 1 .

Corresponding to optimal jacket tem perature, the optimal value of the operation time is 63.8 min, which is a reduction by 57% relative to base case.

Optim al monomer conversion is shown in Figure 7.6. It is observed to be always higher than th at for base case. The optimal number and weight average polymer molecular weights {Mn and Mw) are respectively shown in Figure 7.3 and 7.4. The changes in monomer conversion, and average molecular weights with time almost coincide with respectively those in case of Objective 1. The reason is th at corresponding optimal reactor and jacket tem peratures for Objective 1 and 2 are not much different, and are close to their upper limit.

jacket tem perature, and to facilitate higher monomer conversion during th at time, the initial tem perature of reactor was set at a low value of 0°C. Furthermore, wider range (for lower values) was made available to jacket tem perature by reducing its lower limit to -20°C . Figure 7.5 shows the resulting optimal control policy for jacket tem perature, which spans 1510.1 min of operation time, and yields the final monomer conversion of 82.9%. Although the lower limit for jacket tem perature is - 2 0 °C, its lowest optimal value is above 16°C. At the beginning optimal jacket tem perature is 59.5 C which is the highest for all control stages. The tem perature generally declines later on except for the third control stage. It is noticed th a t the third control stage is quite longer duration than other stages. The reason is that control stages are equispaced over the specified independent variable, M,,, which undergoes the slowest change with time in the third control stage (see Figure 7.3). In fact, the rates of change of both and Mw (Figure 7.4) with time are reduced in the third control. The

rate of change of M w is mostly negative in the third control stage. This behavior is due

The trend of optimal jacket tem perature after the first control stage is closely followed by corresponding optimal reactor tem perature as seen in Figure 7.7. The change in optimal monomer conversion with time, as seen in Figure 7.6, is very small up to the first half of the third stage after which the conversion rises to the final value of 82.9%.

tem perature, and the lower limit of jacket tem perature th at were used for Objective 3. The realization of the present optimal control objective with high monomer conversions is lower than the previous Objective 3. The reason is the initial increase of My, with time being higher than th at of M,,. This limitation results in polymerization that meets the specification of My, f very quickly, thereby reducing the time available for optimal control through jacket tem perature. Figure 7.5 shows the resulting optimal jacket tem perature versus time which spans 990.9 min of operation time, and yields a final monomer conversion of 71.4%. This value (as well as operation time) is lower than th at for Objective 3, thereby indicating the effect of the above mentioned limitation. After the first control stage, the tem perature goes down progressively, and is closely followed by optimal reactor tem perature as seen in Figure 7.7. Optimal Mn (Figure 7 .3 ),

The tem perature of heat-exchange fluid in jacket of reactor was utilized as a control function of a specified independent variable. The process constraints were maximum reactor tem perature, and the upper and lower limits to the heat-exchange fluid. The above objectives were formulated to help provide wider choices for polymer produc tion simultaneously with the optimum efficiency of operation. Equations were provided to suitably transform the model of batch MMA polymerization with a bifunctional initiator in the range of specified variable other than time, and to evaluate the elements of jacobian. Based on the model, the four optimal control objectives were realized using a robust method based on genetic algorithms. The results of optimal control showed significant performance improvements compared to base case without optimal control.

Final Conclusion and Future Work

Optim al control policies were determined for the free radical polymerization of three different polymerization processes, in a non-isothermal batch reactor as follows:
1. 2.

Bulk polymerization of BMA Solution polymerization of MMA with monofunctional initiator

3. Solution polymerization of MMA with bifunctional initiator Four optim al control objectives were developed for the above three different free radical polymerization processes in a non-isothermal batch reactor. The objectives were:
1. 2. 3.

maximization of monomer conversion in a specified operation time, minimization of operation time for a specified, final monomer conversion, maximization of monomer conversion for a specified, final number average polymer molecular weight, and

4.

maximization of monomer conversion for a specified, final weight average polymer molecular weight.

The above objectives were designed to achieve higher production rate with minimum pro cessing time. The tem perature of heat-exchange fluid inside reactor jacket was employed as a control function of a specified independent variable. Process model equations were provided for the above three polymerization processes. Equations were piovided to suitably trans form the process model in the range of specified variable other than time, and to evaluate the elements of jacobian. Based on the detailed non-isothermal process model developed for the above three polymerization processes, the objectives' were realized using a genetic algorithms-based optimal control method. 98

8.1 Future Work The results of optimal control, for bulk batch polymerization of BMA, batch polymerization of MMA with monofunctional initiator, and batch polymerization of MMA with bifunctional initiator, showed significant performance improvements compared to base case without op tim al control.

8.1
1.

Future W ork
In the last objective of optimal control of BMA polymerization, monomer conversion was not high as th at in case of other objectives. Also, a couple of initial control stages were of very short duration. In the future optimal control studies, by dealing these challenges, one can deliver high monomer conversion with specified weight average polymer molecular weight.

2.

One can work on the optimal control studies of BMA polymerization in the presence of benzene solvent, by implementing the restriction of a minimum duration for a control stage.

3. One can work in the last two optimal control objectives of optim al control of MMA polymerization with monofunctional initiator, with the additional restriction of mini mum duration for a control stage. 4. Reaction mechanism for the MMA polymerization with bifunctional initiator, shown in this thesis, is applicable for the styrene polymerization. One can perform optimal control studies on the styrene polymerization by using more than one control function. In addition to the controlling of jacket tem perature, one can also control the initiator addition in a semi-batch polymerization system.
