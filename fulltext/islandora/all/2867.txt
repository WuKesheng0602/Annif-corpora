Abstract Impact of Victimization During Youth on Adult High-Risk Sexual Behaviour Among Gay and Bisexual Men Tyler G. Tulloch Master of Arts Psychology Ryerson University 2013 Based on the minority stress model, this study examines the impact of general and gay-specific childhood teasing on adult high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men, mediated by depression and social anxiety. High-risk sexual behaviour was operationalized as the number of acts of unprotected anal intercourse with a partner of opposite or unknown HIV status, and also as the number of partners of opposite or unknown HIV status with whom an individual engaged in unprotected anal intercourse. Depression, social anxiety, and retrospective self-report of childhood teasing were measured at baseline, and sexual behaviour was measured at 6-month follow-up. Results indicate that gay-specific teasing, but not general teasing, was indirectly associated with number of high-risk sex acts via depression. Additionally, both types of teasing were directly associated with number of high-risk sex partners after accounting for depression and social anxiety.

Impact of Victimization During Youth on Adult High-Risk Sexual Behaviour Among Gay and Bisexual Men Since the beginning of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic, over 60 million people have been infected and almost 30 million people have died. Although the number of new infections has decreased by 20% over the past decade, the number of people living with HIV continues to increase due to improved access to antiretroviral treatment (UNAIDS, 2010a). Globally, the greatest prevalence of HIV is in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 68% (22.5 million) of HIV-positive individuals reside, and the dominant modes of transmission are unprotected heterosexual intercourse and mother-infant transmission (UNAIDS, 2010b). In Canada and the United States, the populations at highest risk are gay and bisexual men, injecting drug users, and immigrants from endemic countries. However, the dominant mode of transmission in both countries is unprotected anal intercourse between men (UNAIDS, 2009). Despite education and prevention efforts aimed at reducing high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men, this group continues to have a disproportionately higher HIV prevalence and incidence than any other group in Canada and the United States. In Canada, the incidence of HIV among gay and bisexual men remained relatively stable from 2004 to 2008, and in 2008 the risk group with the largest proportion of new HIV infections was gay and bisexual men, with 44.5% of new infections being attributed to sexual contact between men (Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC], 2010). In 2009, there were 2,417 new positive HIV cases reported in Canada, with 41.8% of these attributed to sexual contact between adult men (PHAC). This trend is similar in the United States, where approximately 61% of all new HIV infections between 2006 and 2009 occurred among gay and bisexual men (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Given that gay and bisexual men continue to make up the

!

1

!

majority of new infections in North America, continued investigation into psychosocial factors that impact high-risk sexual behaviour of gay and bisexual men is warranted (Wolitski and Fenton, 2011). High-risk sexual behaviour may be operationalized in different ways. The per-contact probability of HIV transmission between men during unprotected anal intercourse is estimated to range from 0.11% for circumcised men engaging in insertive anal intercourse to 1.43% for men engaging in receptive anal intercourse with ejaculation by the insertive partner (Jin et al., 2010). These data suggest that the risk of HIV transmission increases each time an individual has unprotected anal intercourse with someone whose HIV status is either serodiscordant (i.e., an HIV-negative man and an HIV-positive man having sex), or unknown. There are also data to suggest that having four or more male sex partners is associated with an increased risk of HIV transmission compared to men reporting less than four partners (Koblin et al., 2006). In a metaanalysis examining the link between negative affect and sexual risk behaviour (Crepaz & Marks, 2001), high-risk sexual behaviour was operationalized in a number of ways across studies, including number of times an individual has had unprotected anal intercourse (either insertive or receptive) with a partner of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status, number of partners of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status with whom an individual has had unprotected anal intercourse, and a composite of number of times and number of partners. Theoretical Models Explaining Sexual Health Outcomes in Gay and Bisexual Men Multiple co-occurring psychosocial problems in a given population may sometimes produce a cumulative negative impact on health outcomes, creating what is known as a syndemic, defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as synergistically interacting epidemics that impact a given population (CDC, 2012). According to the syndemic

!

2

!

model, one explanation for the disproportionately high incidence of HIV among gay and bisexual men may be the additive impact of multiple psychosocial problems faced by some members of this community, such as mental health problems, substance use, verbal and physical victimization, and minority stress (Stall et al., 2003). Several studies have documented the additive effects of multiple psychosocial problems in predicting high-risk sexual behaviour and HIV-positive status among gay and bisexual men (e.g., Mustanski, Garofalo, Herrick, & Donenberg, 2007; Stall et al., 2003). Although the syndemic model illustrates that multiple co-occurring psychosocial problems such as mental health problems and victimization have an additive negative impact on sexual health outcomes, the syndemic model does not elucidate the way in which these psychosocial problems interact with one another nor does it indicate the directionality of influence. The concept of minority stress, defined as psychosocial stress resulting from having minority status (Brooks, 1981), has been incorporated into research examining adverse mental health outcomes among gay men (Meyer, 1995). The minority stress model (Meyer, 2003) adds to the syndemics literature by indicating the nature of the relationships among psychosocial problems. The minority stress model is used to explain why minority group members such as gay and bisexual men experience disproportionately higher rates of mental health problems as compared with non-minorities. According to this model, stressors such as stigma, prejudice, and discrimination that are directed toward gay and bisexual men create a hostile social environment resulting in mental health problems. Meyer proposes that minority stress occurs along a continuum ranging from distal to proximal. Distal stressors are objective events such as discrimination, victimization, or violence that are experienced by the individual. Proximal stressors are subjective personal processes such as internalized homophobia, concealment of

!

3

!

sexual orientation, and expectations of rejection that are based on an individual's experiences. The use of the terms distal and proximal in the minority stress model refers to distance from the individual (i.e., outer vs. inner processes), rather than temporal distance (i.e., past vs. present) Hatzenbuehler and colleagues (2008) tested the minority stress model and reported that proximal minority stress within the past 12 months was associated with depression symptoms as well as high-risk sexual behaviour, indicating that minority stress may play a role in both mental and sexual health outcomes. Hatzenbuehler (2009) then proposed a psychological mediation framework whereby minority stress (i.e., discrimination, expectations of rejection) experienced by members of stigmatized minority groups leads to an increase in general negative psychological processes (i.e., emotion dysregulation, social and interpersonal problems, maladaptive cognitive processes) that are associated with mental health problems. These general psychological processes, in turn, mediate the relationship between minority stress and mental health problems. In light of evidence suggesting proximal minority stress is associated with high-risk sexual behaviour among adults (Hatzenbuehler, 2008), the current study examines the long-term impact of distal minority stress experienced during childhood on high-risk sexual behaviour in adulthood. Specifically, the current study examines the impact of childhood victimization, a form of distal minority stress that is disproportionately experienced by gay and bisexual men (Bontempo & D'Augelli, 2002), on sexual health outcomes in adulthood, proposing that mental health problems will mediate the association between minority stress and high-risk sexual behaviour. Mental Health Problems As might be predicted by the minority stress model, gay and bisexual men suffer from mental health problems such as mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders at a higher rate

!

!

than heterosexual men (Cochran, Sullivan, & Mays, 2003; Sandfort, de Graaf, Bijl, & Schnabel, 2001). Specifically, they are more likely than heterosexual men to experience major depression, bipolar disorder, and all anxiety disorders except for generalized anxiety disorder. They are also 2.7 times more likely than heterosexual men to suffer from comorbid psychological disorders (Sandfort et al.). Mental health problems have also been implicated in high-risk sexual behaviour between gay and bisexual men (e.g., Safren, Blashill, & O'Cleirigh, 2011; Stall et al., 2003; Mustanski, Garofalo, Herrick, & Donenberg, 2007). Depression severity has been associated with greater risk for HIV infection (Alvy et al., 2011; Hutton, Lyketsos, Zenilman, Thompson, & Erbelding, 2004; Koblin et al., 2006; Ryan, Forehand, Solomon, & Miller, 2008), including higher rates of unprotected receptive anal intercourse (Parsons, Halkitis, Wolitski, & Gomez, 2003) and having three or more sex partners in a six-month period (Perdue, Hagan, Thiede, & Valleroy, 2003). The association between depression and high-risk sexual behaviour has not been consistently demonstrated across all studies, possibly because there is a curvilinear relationship between the two variables or because additional variables may moderate the association (Crepaz & Marks, 2001). Meta-analytic results suggest that depression may be a slightly stronger correlate of highrisk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men than among other populations (Crepaz & Marks). Another mental health problem that has been associated with high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men is social anxiety (Hart & Heimberg, 2005; Hart, James, Purcell, & Farber, 2008; Hart, James, Roberts, Meyers, Calzavara, & Loutfy, 2009). Social performance anxiety, which is anxiety in situations where one may be observed while performing an activity, has been associated with insertive unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among young gay and

!

bisexual men (Hart & Heimberg) as well as HIV-positive gay and bisexual men (Hart et al., 2008; Hart et al., 2009), even after controlling for depression and the use of club drugs and tobacco (Hart et al., 2008). Evidence suggests that social anxiety predict sexual risk behaviour six months later among gay and bisexual men (Hart et al., 2009). Childhood Victimization as a Predictor of Both Sexual and Mental Health Another psychosocial problem associated with high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men is early victimization. Childhood victimization can take many forms, including abuse and neglect, verbal assault and teasing, verbal threats of physical harm, physical assault with or without a weapon, damage to personal property, and sexual assault. Childhood victimization may be experienced either directly or vicariously, and may be perpetrated by peers, caregivers, or other adults. Studies have demonstrated that sexual minority youth experience peer victimization at greater rates than their heterosexual peers (Bontempo & D'Augelli, 2002, Russell, Franz, & Driscoll, 2001). Bontempo and D'Augelli (2002) reported that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) youths were more likely to experience victimization than heterosexual peers, with 10.1% of sexual minority females and 24.0% of sexual minority males reporting victimization versus 1.1% and 2.7% of heterosexual females and males, respectively. For LGBQ adolescents, victimization related to sexual orientation appears to be the norm rather than the exception. For example, D'Augelli, Pilkington, and Hershberger (2002) found that 59% of LGBQ youths reported experiencing verbal abuse related to sexual orientation in high school, 11% reported physical abuse, 11% reported having objects thrown at them, and 24% were threatened with physical violence. In another sample of young gay and bisexual men, 87% reported some type of verbal sexual orientation victimization, with an average age of onset of 11 years (D'Augelli, Grossman, & Starks, 2006).

Among gay and bisexual men and other sexual minorities, physical and verbal peer victimization have been negatively associated with mental health outcomes (Burton, Marshal, Chisolm, Sucato, & Friedman, 2013; D'Augelli et al., 2002; Hightow-Weidman et al., 2011; Rivers, 2004). For example, Burton and colleagues (2013) reported that gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth who experienced sexual minority-specific victimization reported higher levels of depression and suicidality. Hightow-Weidman and colleagues (2011) found that young gay and bisexual men who experienced sexual minority-specific victimization were 2.29 times more likely to report clinically significant depression symptoms than those who did not experience such victimization. D'Augelli and colleagues (2002) found that LGBQ youth who reported more frequent verbal victimization were more likely to experience mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress symptoms and past-week general mental health problems as measured using the Brief Symptom Inventory (see Derogatis, 1993). The impact of childhood victimization on mental health in adulthood has received much less attention. Two studies have examined associations between childhood peer victimization and mental health in adulthood; however, these did not examine the impact of victimization among sexual minority populations. A retrospective, longitudinal study associated retrospective selfreport of bullying in school with current depression in adulthood among a sample of middle-aged men (Lund et al., 2009). A prospective longitudinal birth cohort study (Gibb, Horwood, & Fergusson, 2011) associated parental report of bullying during adolescence with depression and anxiety in adulthood. Gibb and colleagues reported small to medium effect sizes prior to adjusting for eleven covariates, after which the effects were no longer statistically significant. It is possible that the results of these retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies may differ for sexual minority populations.

Childhood peer victimization has also been associated with high-risk sexual behaviour among sexual minority youth (Bontempo & D'Augelli, 2002). Bontempo and D'Augelli examined the victimization of LGBQ youth in the form of assault (or threat of assault) with a weapon and/or damage or theft of private property. LGBQ youth experienced higher rates of victimization than heterosexual peers and highly victimized LGBQ youth exhibited more sexual risk behaviour (i.e., unprotected sexual intercourse and/or using alcohol or drugs at last intercourse) than did less victimized LGBQ youth. These studies suggest that victimization is associated with mental health problems as well as high-risk sexual behaviour in young gay and bisexual men. Goal and Hypotheses The above studies examined the link between peer victimization during youth and temporally proximal mental and sexual health outcomes among gay and bisexual men and other sexual minorities. However, previous research has not examined how victimization by peers during youth is associated with more distal sexual health outcomes among gay and bisexual men, and whether this relationship is mediated by poor mental health outcomes. The current study will therefore examine the association between peer victimization during youth and current adult mental health problems in order to better understand how these psychosocial variables lead to subsequent high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men. It is hypothesized that peer victimization during youth will be associated with poorer mental health outcomes in adulthood and that this will be associated with subsequent high-risk sexual behaviour. Figure 1 illustrates the hypothesized relationship between these variables. For the purpose of this study, victimization during youth will be operationalized as being verbally bullied or teased about a range of general and gay-specific characteristics and behaviours. As illustrated above,

!

depression and social anxiety are both elevated in gay and bisexual men and have also been associated with high-risk sexual behaviour, therefore these two mental health problems will be used in the current study as potential mediators of the relationship between victimization and high-risk sexual behaviour. Recent research (Burt & Thiede, 2012; Hart, James, Hagan, & Boucher, 2010; Holtgrave, Crosby, & Shouse, 2006) indicates that HIV-positive gay and bisexual men are more likely than HIV-negative men to engage in UAI. HIV serostatus will therefore be included in the model as a covariate in order to control for its impact on UAI. For the purpose of this study, high-risk sexual behaviour was operationalized in two ways: number of times an individual has had unprotected anal intercourse (either insertive or receptive) with a partner of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status; and number of non-primary partners of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status with whom an individual has had unprotected anal intercourse. Victimization was operationalized as being verbally harassed or teased by peers, either for general reasons (i.e., being ugly or unattractive), or gay-specific reasons (i.e., acting like a sissy) in childhood. The teasing referred to in the present study does not refer to good-natured teasing between friends, but rather teasing that is intended to belittle, insult, or ostracize an individual. There are two sets of hypotheses in the current study, one set for each of the two operationalizations of high-risk sexual behaviour. The first set of hypotheses will predict highrisk sexual behaviour as number of times an individual has had unprotected anal intercourse with a partner of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status, hereafter referred to as number of high-risk sex acts. Hypothesis 1a is that general teasing during youth, reported retrospectively, will be significantly associated with the number of high-risk sex acts, and that this relationship will be completely mediated by severity of depression and social anxiety after controlling for HIV

!

status. For Hypothesis 1b, general teasing will be replaced with gay-specific teasing in predicting high-risk sexual behaviour. The second set of hypotheses (2a and 2b) will mirror the first set, with the exception that high-risk sexual behaviour will be operationalized as the number of non-primary partners of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status with whom the individual has had unprotected anal intercourse, hereafter referred to number of high-risk sex partners. Depression, social anxiety, HIV status, and retrospective self-report of teasing were measured at baseline, and high-risk sexual behaviour was measured at 6-month follow-up. This was to ensure the mediators occurred temporally prior to the outcome variables. Method Participants The initial sample consisted of 302 self-identified gay and bisexual men recruited for the Sexual Health and Attitudes Research Project (SHARP; e.g., James et al., 2012). Recruitment was conducted so that the sample was approximately 50% HIV-negative and 50% HIV-positive, as the original study conducted analyses to compare men by HIV status. SHARP participants were recruited from the Polaris Seroconversion Cohort Study (Calzavara et al., 2003) and from advertisements in local print media magazines for gay men (see Appendix A). The Polaris study was a multidisciplinary in-depth study of recently seroconverted gay and bisexual men and HIVnegative controls; therefore, the present sample included both HIV-positive and HIV-negative men. The two groups of HIV-positive and HIV-negative men in the original Polaris study were equivalent in terms of age, education, race, and sexual orientation. The inclusion criteria were that participants must 1) be men of 18 years of age or older, 2) speak and understand English, 3) have had sexual contact with another male in the past six months, and 4) give informed consent to participate in the study. Participants in SHARP were excluded if during the interview or times

!

during the data collection section it was found that their ability to understand and complete the self-report questionnaires was compromised due to physiological or psychological constraints such as 1) central nervous system conditions (e.g., advanced HIV-associated dementia), 2) acute psychotic conditions, and/or 3) acute mood dysregulation (e.g., manic states). All 302 participants completed the baseline questionnaires, and 238 participants completed the questionnaires at 6-month follow-up, representing a 6-month attrition rate of 21%. The initial sample consisting of all 302 participants was used to examine the internal consistency and factor structure of the 13 gay-specific teasing items. The majority of this sample identified as either gay (90%) or bisexual (8%). The sample was primarily White (76%) and as per study design, was composed of equal numbers of HIV-positive (50%) and HIV-negative (50%) men. Sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. The final sample at 6-month follow-up consisting of 238 participants was used to conduct the mediation analysis. The majority of men in the final sample self-identified as gay (94%), White (77%), and had some sort of university degree (45%). The final sample was roughly equivalent in terms of HIV status with a slight majority reporting as HIV-negative (52%). Consistent with other studies examining sexual behaviour variables (e.g., Crepaz et al., 2009; Williamson, Dodds, Mercey, Hart, & Johnson, 2008), the outcome variables were not normally distributed. Number of high-risk sex acts and high-risk sex partners were both extremely positively skewed (zskew > 33.0, p < .0001 for both variables), and leptokurtic (zkurtosis > 104.0, p < .0001 for both variables). These variables were not transformed, given that bootstrapping mediation analysis, used in the current study, does not require normally distributed data. The means and standard deviations of study measures are presented in Table 2.

Measures Teasing Questionnaire-Revised. The Teasing Questionnaire-Revised (TQ-R; Storch, Roth, Coles, Heimberg, Bravata, & Moser, 2003) is a multifactorial 29-item self-report scale used to measure memories of childhood teasing in adults across five domains: performance, academics, social behaviour, family background, and appearance. Participants indicate to what degree they were teased about each topic based on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from "I was never teased about this" to "I was always teased about this". The Cronbach's alpha for the TQ-R for heterosexual adult participants is .87, indicating excellent internal consistency. Because the current study examines memories of teasing among gay and bisexual men, 13 items reflecting gay-specific teasing were created and added to the TQ-R. These items are presented in Table 3. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine the factor structure and internal consistency of the gay-specific items. Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) is a 20-item self-report scale designed to measure depression symptoms in the general population. Participants rate how often they experienced each of the symptoms over the past week on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 ("rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)") to 3 ("most or all of the time (5-7 days)"), with a maximum total score of 60. The scale includes four reverse-coded items such as "I felt hopeful about the future" and "I enjoyed life". The CES-D has very good split-half internal consistency in both general and clinical populations (Cronbach's alpha = .85 and .90, respectively), and adequate test-retest reliability, ranging from r = .51 for a 2-week retest period to .67 for a 4-week retest period (Radloff). Test-retest correlations for 6- and 8-week periods were between the above values. The CES-D discriminates well between psychiatric inpatients

!

12

!

and the general population, with 70% of inpatients but only 21% of individuals in the general population scoring an arbitrary cutoff score of 16 or above in Radloff's original validation study. The CES-D has not been validated among gay men; however, it has been used in studies of psychological functioning among gay men (e.g. Ostrow et al., 1989; Perdue et al., 2003). Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987) is a clinician-administered semi-structured interview designed to assess the types of situations that individuals with social anxiety fear and avoid. It is comprised of 24 questions that assess the level of fear and avoidance across 11 social interaction situations (e.g., going to a party) and 13 performance situations (e.g., being the center of attention). The clinician asks the client to rate the level of fear and avoidance over the past week for each situation on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3. Client ratings of fear range from "none" to "severe", and ratings of avoidance range from "never (0%)" to "usually (67-100%)". As the LSAS is a semi-structured interview, the clinician may follow-up on answers to clarify responses. An overall total score is calculated as well as six possible subscale scores: 1) total fear, 2) fear of social interaction situations, 3) fear of performance situations, 4) total avoidance, 5) avoidance of social interaction situations, and 6) avoidance of performance situations. Mennin, Fresco, Heimberg, Schneier, Davies and Liebowitz (2002) performed a Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis to determine optimal cut-off values for the LSAS. It was determined that a cut-off score of 30 provides an optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing social anxiety disorder whereas the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder is best diagnosed using a cut-off score of 60. A cutoff score of 15 on the total social interaction and total performance subscales is optimal for diagnosing social anxiety disorder. An alternative suggested range of cut-off values for the LSAS total score is 51 or less indicating mild social

!

!

anxiety, 52-81 indicating moderate social anxiety, and 82 or greater indicating severe social anxiety (Montgomery, 1998). The LSAS and its subscales have excellent internal consistency (Heimberg et al., 2003). Cronbach's alpha for the total score is .96 and ranges from .81 to .92 for each of the six subscales. The total score is extremely highly correlated with the total social interaction and total fear subscales (rs = .98), and is very highly correlated with all other subscales (rs range from .90 to .93). The correlations between all six subscales ranged from r = .68 to r = .94. The LSAS total score has convergent validity with the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; Mattick & Clarke, 1998) and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS; Mattick & Clarke) with r values of .73 and .61, respectively (p < .001). There is convergent validity between the total fear subscale and the SIAS and SPS (rs = .70 and .62, p < .001, respectively), as well as between the total avoidance subscale and the SIAS and SPS (rs = .72 and .58, p < .001, respectively; Heimberg et al.). Heimberg et al. demonstrated discriminant validity between the LSAS and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A; Hamilton, 1959), a measure of general anxiety, as well as between the LSAS and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1961), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D; Hamilton, 1960), measures of depression. Sexual behaviour questions. Following other HIV behavioural science research (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, O'Cleirigh, Mimiaga, & Safren, 2011; Koblin et al., 2003), the sexual behaviour questions ask about participants' history of high risk sexual behaviour over the past six months. Specifically, participants were asked about number of primary and/or casual partners, HIV status of partners, frequency of insertive and receptive anal sex acts, and frequency of condom use. Participants were asked to respond yes or no to each question indicating a given type of sexual behaviour (e.g., insertive anal intercourse with male partners of unknown HIV status), and where

appropriate, to indicate the number of times a behaviour occurred. To assist participants in accurately reporting frequency of behaviours, they were provided with a scale indicating the number of times a given behaviour would have occurred over six months if it happened an average of once per month, once per week, 2-3 times per week, or daily. To examine high-risk sexual behaviour with partners of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status, data were collapsed as appropriate. For example, for HIV-negative participants, a variable was created indicating number of insertive anal intercourse acts with partners of HIV-positive or unknown HIV status and number of partners of HIV-positive or unknown HIV status. All measures are presented in full in Appendix B. Procedure Trained research assistants contacted potential participants from the Polaris study by telephone to inform them about the current study. Potential participants were advised that the current study was investigating the psychological functioning and sexual behaviour of gay and bisexual men, involved completing several questionnaires and a brief interview, would take approximately 3 hours to complete over two sessions, and that $80 would be provided as compensation for their time. Inclusion criteria were assessed over the phone during this initial contact. Individuals who agreed to participate were provided with more detailed information about the study before providing informed consent. Polaris participants provided informed consent at the Polaris site at the University of Toronto before coming to the HIV Prevention Lab to complete the brief interview and questionnaires. Participants who contacted the HIV Prevention Lab directly through advertisements provided informed consent at the HIV Prevention Lab (see Appendix C).

Once on site, participants provided informed consent by signing a consent form explaining the potential risks and benefits of participation. The risks and benefits associated with the study were minimal. There was minimal risk of participants experiencing emotional discomfort while answering some of the questions. The principal investigator, a clinical psychologist working with gay and bisexual men of both HIV-negative and HIV-positive statuses, provided training to all research assistants to deal with any emotional discomfort and to provide psychological and/or support referrals if needed. Another potential risk involved breach of confidentiality. To safeguard participants' identities, names and contact information were stored separately from questionnaire and interview data, which was associated only with a participant identity code. Self-report questionnaires were completed via Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (A-CASI) at two sessions: baseline and 6-month follow-up. A-CASI methodology has been shown to increase reporting of stigmatized behaviours relative to interviewer-administered personal interview (Perlis, Des Jarlais, Friedman, Arasteh, & Turner, 2004; Tourangeau & Smith, 1996; Turner, 1998). Upon completion of a session, participants were debriefed and received $30 for compensation. Statistical Analyses Given that previous studies have indicated that sexual behaviour variables are not normally distributed (e.g., Crepaz et al., 2009; Williamson, Dodds, Mercey, Hart, & Johnson, 2008), bootstrapping, a nonparametric resampling procedure, was used to test the mediation hypotheses. Bootstrapping is an inferential statistical procedure that uses resampling to approximate a given sampling distribution without assuming normality, resulting in more accurate confidence intervals than standard methods (Hayes & Preacher, 2010). Some

!

advantages of bootstrapping when testing indirect effects of mediation are that assumptions about the sample distribution are unnecessary, statistical power and Type I error rates are more favourable with small to moderate samples when using bootstrapping as compared to parametric procedures, and confidence intervals are often asymmetric and more accurately represent true versus ideal sampling distributions (Hayes & Preacher; Fritz & MacKinnon, 2007). Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation analysis is the most powerful type of mediation in terms of detecting an effect, with recommended sample sizes ranging from n = 34 to n = 462, depending on the size of the paths between predictor, mediator, and outcome variables (Fritz & MacKinnon, 2007). For mediation models with medium associations between variables, recommended sample size is n = 148 when bias-corrected bootstrap mediation is used. For mediation models with small associations between variables, the recommended sample size increases to at least n = 368 (Fritz & MacKinnon). Prior longitudinal research examining the impact of childhood peer victimization on adult mental health problems has demonstrated small to medium effects (Gibb et al., 2011). The level of association between mental health problems in adulthood and high-risk sexual behaviour in the context of childhood peer victimization is unknown. It is possible that the current sample of n = 238 is sufficient to detect an effect, given the guidelines outlined by Fritz and MacKinnon. As the hypotheses involved multiple parallel mediators and continuously distributed variables, the Process bootstrapping macro for SPSS version 2.04 (Hayes, 2013) was used to perform the mediation analyses. The Process macro incorporates most of the features of preexisting macros and is designed to estimate direct and indirect effects in mediation models with multiple mediators, and also supports the use of moderators, covariates, and mediators acting in serial versus parallel sequence (Hayes). The number of samples performed may vary from 1000

!

17

!

to 50,000, but 10,000 has been used in statistical demonstrations of bootstrapping in peerreviewed publications (Hayes & Preacher, 2010; Preacher & Kelley, 2011), therefore 10,000 samples were used in the present study. In order to correct for skew in the sample, the biascorrected bootstrap rather than the percentile bootstrap was used. In traditional mediation models, several paths are tested for statistical significance in order to determine whether mediation is present. The a path refers to the impact of the independent variable (X) on the mediator(s) (M), and the b path refers to the impact of the mediator(s) (M) on the dependent variable (Y). The product of the a and b paths, ab, refers to the impact of the independent variable (X) on the dependent variable (Y), via the mediator(s) (M), and is known as the indirect effect. The c path refers to the total impact of the independent variable (X) has on the dependent variable (Y), not accounting for the impact of any other variables, and is known as the total effect. Finally, the c' path refers to the impact of the independent variable (X) on the dependent variable (Y), accounting for the impact of all other variables (i.e., a and b paths), and is known as the direct effect. The total effect (c) is the sum of the direct (c') and indirect (ab) effects. For each of the four hypotheses, a bootstrapping mediation analysis was conducted to examine total, direct, and indirect effects. Results Group Equivalence A series of independent samples t-tests revealed that dropouts and completers did not differ on any of the study variables: TQ-R, TQ-R gay specific items, CESD, LSAS, or dependent variables scores. A series of chi-square tests revealed that dropouts and completers did not differ on ethnicity, educational background, employment status, HIV status, or sex role (e.g., top, bottom, versatile). The only statistically significant sociodemographic differences between

!

18

!

groups were sexual orientation, 2 (2) = 13.88, p < .01, and total annual income, 2 (5) = 12.05, p < .05, with dropouts being more likely to identify as straight or bisexual and to report belonging to a lower annual income category. There were only three straight-identified men in the sample, and only one of them completed the study. Bivariate Analyses Two-tailed Spearman correlations were performed on all variables, as the outcome variables were nonparametric. The results are presented in Table 3. Number of high-risk sex acts was correlated with all variables, and number of high-risk partners was correlated with all variables except depression and social anxiety. Exploratory Factor Analysis An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with maximum likelihood extraction was used to examine the factor structure of the 13 gay-specific teasing items (see Table 2) added to the TQ-R for the purpose of the study. All item correlations were between r = .30 and r = .90. As the factors were expected to correlate with one another, an oblique rotation (direct oblimin) was applied. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value (KMO = .94) testing sampling adequacy was greater than the acceptable minimum limit of .50 (Hutcheson & Sofroniou, 1999), indicating superb adequacy. Bartlett's test of sphericity, 2 (78) = 3473.30, p < .001, indicated sufficient correlations between items to conduct EFA. Results revealed two factors with eigenvalues greater than Kaiser's criterion of 1.0 that together explained 68.6% of the variance after extraction. Because the sample size exceeds 250 (n = 302) and the average of the communalities (0.69) is greater than 0.60, it is appropriate to accept Kaiser's criteria of retaining any factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 (Field, 2009). The scree plot also indicated a two-factor solution; therefore due to the convergence of these indicators, a two-factor solution was retained.

Factor loadings are presented in Table 2. Based on the items that cluster together, Factor 1 appears to represent nonconforming gender presentation and Factor 2 nonconforming gendered social activity. The two factors had a strong positive correlation (r = .70). The internal consistency of all 13 gay-specific teasing questions was excellent, Cronbach's  = .95, and the internal consistencies of factors 1 and 2 ranged from good ( = .87) to excellent ( = .95), respectively. Because the results of the EFA indicated the presence of two underlying factors, two separate mediation analyses were conducted to examine the possibility that being teased for nonconforming gender presentation and being teased for nonconforming gendered social activity would be associated in different ways with the study's outcome variables. Therefore, each set of hypotheses (1 and 2) included three mediation analyses: one for each of the three separate independent variables, namely (a) general teasing, (b) teasing for nonconforming gender presentation, and (c) teasing for nonconforming gendered social activity. Mediation Analyses Hypothesis 1a, that general teasing during youth would predict number of high-risk sex acts during follow-up, was tested with the bootstrapping mediation analysis using depression and social anxiety as mediators and HIV status as the covariate. There was a total effect of general teasing on number of high-risk sex acts, B = .10, p < .01, such that teasing was positively associated with number of high-risk sex acts. There were no direct or indirect effects, however, after accounting for the mediators and the covariate. The results of this analysis are summarized in Figure 2. Hypothesis 1b, that teasing for nonconforming gender presentation during youth would predict number of high-risk sex acts during follow-up, was tested with the bootstrapping mediation analysis using depression and social anxiety as mediators and HIV status as the

!

!

covariate. There were no total, direct, or indirect effects observed. These results are summarized in Figure 3. Hypothesis 1c, that teasing for nonconforming gendered social activity during youth would predict number of high-risk sex acts during follow-up, was tested with the bootstrapping mediation analysis using depression and social anxiety as mediators and HIV status as the covariate. There were no total or direct effects observed, but there was a total indirect effect, B = .09, 95% CI [.009, .233], such that teasing was positively associated with number of high-risk sex acts via higher levels of mental health problems. This indirect effect was not specific to either depression or social anxiety. These results are summarized in Figure 4. Hypothesis 2a, that general teasing during youth would predict number of high-risk sex partners during follow-up, was tested with the bootstrapping mediation analysis using depression and social anxiety as mediators and HIV status as the covariate. There was a total effect of general teasing on number of high-risk sex partners, B = .09, p < .001, as well as a direct effect, B = .08, p < .01, after accounting for mediators and covariate. General teasing was positively associated with number of high-risk sex partners. There were no indirect effects observed. These results are summarized in Figure 5. Hypothesis 2b, that teasing for nonconforming gender presentation during youth would predict number of high-risk sex partners during follow-up, was tested with the bootstrapping mediation analysis using depression and social anxiety as mediators and HIV status as the covariate. There was a total effect of teasing for nonconforming gender presentation on number of high-risk sex partners, B = .10, p < .05, as well as a direct effect, B = .08, p < .05, after accounting for mediators and covariate. This type of teasing was positively associated with

!

21

!

number of high-risk sex partners. There were no indirect effects observed. These results are summarized in Figure 6. Hypothesis 2c, that teasing for nonconforming gendered social activity during youth would predict number of high-risk sex partners during follow-up, was tested with the bootstrapping mediation analysis using depression and social anxiety as mediators and HIV status as the covariate. There was a total effect of teasing for nonconforming gendered social activity on number of high-risk sex partners, B = .21, p < .05, as well as a direct effect, B = .19, p < .05, after accounting for mediators and covariate. This type of teasing was positively associated with number of high-risk sex partners. There were no indirect effects observed. These results are summarized in Figure 7. Exploratory Mediation Analyses For Hypothesis 1c, an indirect effect was observed that was nonspecific to either depression or social anxiety. Due to the possibility that there was insufficient power to detect a unique effect of either mediator, and to examine whether the same pattern of results would be observed for each mediator individually, each of the initial hypotheses was also tested using only one mediator at a time. With depression as the sole mediator, the pattern of results was the same as was observed as in the proposed analyses for all hypotheses except 1b (impact of nonconforming gender presentation on number of high-risk sex acts). For Hypothesis 1b, an indirect effect of nonconforming gender presentation on number of high-risk sex acts, mediated by depression, B = .04, 95% CI [.001, .103] was observed, such that teasing was positively associated with number of high-risk sex acts. With social anxiety as the sole mediator, in comparison to the proposed analyses, there were no additional indirect effects observed, and the sole indirect effect--that of nonconforming

!

22

!

gendered social activity on number of high-risk sex acts (Hypothesis 1c)--disappeared. The total effects in Hypotheses 1c, 2a, 2b, and 2c remained, and a direct effect of general teasing on number of high-risk sex acts (Hypothesis 1a) appeared, B = .10, p < .01. This direct effect was such that general teasing was positively associated with number of high-risk sex acts. The direct effect of nonconforming gender presentation on number of high-risk sex partners (Hypothesis 2b) disappeared. The pattern of results for all mediation analyses is presented in Table 4. Discussion Exploratory Factor Analysis The results of the exploratory factor analysis suggest that the gay-specific teasing questions used in the present study assessed two different types of gay-specific teasing. One of these types was being teased for nonconforming gender presentation such as making feminine gestures, and the other was being teased for nonconforming gendered social activity, such as playing with girls. Upon examining the impact of each of these types of gay-specific teasing on high-risk sexual behaviour separately in the mediation analyses, it appears that they do not always impact sexual health outcomes in the same way, suggesting that different types of gayspecific teasing may have differential impacts on high-risk sexual behaviour, as described below. Mediation Analyses In the current study, the minority stress model (Meyer, 2003) was adapted to include sexual health outcomes along with mental health problems as a consequence of minority stress. It also examined the impact of a distal stressor: childhood peer victimization. The results of the mediation analyses partially support the hypotheses and suggest that both general and gayspecific teasing during youth may play a small role in high-risk sexual behaviour later in adulthood among gay and bisexual men. This provides initial support for adapting the minority

!

23

!

stress model (Meyer, 2003) to include sexual health outcomes. The results do not indicate a consistent impact of all types of teasing for all sexual health outcomes measured in this study. Rather, the results indicate that teasing might impact number of high-risk sex acts and number of high-risk sex partners in different ways. Number of high-risk sex acts. A consistent impact of all types of teasing was not observed on number of high-risk sex acts. Rather, each type of teasing impacted this sexual health outcome in a different way. There were no statistically significant direct or indirect effects of general teasing on number of high-risk sex acts observed in the mediation analysis, but there was a total effect of the entire model. It is possible that general teasing during youth does not impact high-risk sexual behaviour in adulthood. Alternatively, general teasing may impact high-risk sexual behaviour, but to such a small degree that there was insufficient power in the current study to detect it. There were also no statistically significant direct or indirect effects of being teased for nonconforming gender presentation on number of high-risk sex acts. There was, however, an indirect effect of being teased for nonconforming gendered social activity on number of high-risk sex acts. During the exploratory analyses in which depression and social anxiety were examined as mediators individually rather than in tandem, an indirect effect was observed via depression, but not social anxiety, for both types of teasing. This suggests that gay or bisexual men who are teased during childhood for things such as acting "like a girl," or being too feminine, or for engaging in social activities atypical for boys such as playing with girls or having a lot of female friends, may engage in more frequent high-risk sexual behaviour years later when depressed. Although the direct and indirect effects of teasing on high-risk sexual behaviour observed in this study were small, the self-reported teasing occurred in childhood, and the mean age of

!

24

!

participants was 44.2 years. That even a small effect of childhood teasing is observable decades later in adulthood illustrates the far-reaching impact of this type of victimization and the need for interventions aimed to reduce bullying during childhood. Number of high-risk sex partners. In the current study, all types of teasing (general and both types of gay-specific teasing) were directly related to number of high-risk sex partners after accounting for the impact of depression and social anxiety. Although this relation was statistically significant, the observed effects were small, suggesting that other variables may play a more important role in contributing to high-risk sexual behaviour. Several variables, intrapersonal and situational, have been associated with unprotected anal intercourse in gay and bisexual men. Some examples of such intrapersonal variables include sensation seeking (Bancroft, Carnes, & Janssen, 2005; Wim, Christiana, & Marie, 2013), internalized homophobia (Hatzenbuehler, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Erickson, 2008), self-efficacy for safer sex (Bedoya et al., 2012), being the victim of childhood sexual abuse (Mimiaga et al., 2009), and mental health problems such as depression (Houston, Sandfort, Dolezal, & Carballo-Dieguez, 2012; Wim et al.) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (Reisner, Mimiaga, Safren, & Mayer, 2009). Some examples of situational characteristics that have been associated with unprotected anal intercourse among gay and bisexual men include erectile dysfunction (Bancroft et al.), alcohol and substance use (Bedoya et al., 2012; Jacobs et al., 2010; Mayer et al., 2012; Ostrow et al., 2009; Wim et al.), and meeting partners online (Jenness et al., 2010; Mayer et al., 2012; Wim et al.). The finding that all types of teasing were directly related to number of high-risk sex partners is consistent with past research indicating that among college-age females, retrospective self-report of childhood peer victimization, particularly teasing, was positively associated with

!

25

!

total number of sexual partners (Gallup, O'Brien, White, & Wilson, 2009). This same research, however, reported the opposite pattern among college-age males, that retrospective self-report of peer victimization was negatively associated with total number of sexual partners. It should be noted that all males identified as heterosexual, and these findings may not be generalizable to gay or bisexual men. Gallup and colleagues (2009) propose that in a male dominance system, being the victim of peer victimization lowers a male's social status, impacting sexual desirability and mating opportunities. For females in a male dominance system, being the victim of peer victimization does not have the same impact on sexual desirability. It is possible that for gay and bisexual men, being the victim of peer victimization does not have the same detrimental impact on sexual desirability that it has for heterosexual males in a male dominance system. The study by Gallup and colleagues did not examine this association among sexual minority populations. The current study broadens the scope of these findings to include gay and bisexual men, and provides initial evidence that childhood teasing impacts adult sexual behaviour in different ways for heterosexual versus gay or bisexual men. One reason why individuals who are victimized by their peers in the form of verbal bullying engage in high-risk sexual behaviour may be to find acceptance and approval. Individuals who experience more rejection from peers may be more likely to engage in high-risk behaviour, including unprotected sexual intercourse, in order to seek acceptance. This may also explain why teasing was associated with number of partners but not number of acts--it is possible that individuals find a greater sense of acceptance by engaging in sex with multiple partners rather than multiple times with the same partner. There is evidence from a sample of heterosexual African American adolescents to suggest that men who report self-esteem enhancing reasons for having sex report a greater number of sexual partners than those who

!

26

!

report other reasons for having sex (Robinson, Holmbeck, & Paikoff, 2007). It is possible that individuals who engage in sex with multiple partners may do so in an effort to improve selfesteem or gain acceptance. The current study demonstrates that childhood peer victimization negatively impacts sexual health outcomes in adulthood. These results provide support for the minority stress model by demonstrating the impact of a distal stressor, namely childhood peer victimization, on sexual health outcomes. For this outcome--number of high-risk partners-- there was no evidence of mediation via depression or social anxiety. In the current study, social anxiety did not mediate any of the proposed relationships. Research suggests that social anxiety is associated with specific types of high-risk sexual behaviour. For example, social anxiety has been associated with unprotected insertive anal intercourse, but not unprotected receptive anal intercourse (Hart, James, Purcell, & Farber, 2008). In the current study, acts of insertive and receptive anal intercourse were combined to operationalize high-risk sexual behaviour, and this may have masked any potential mediation via social anxiety. Mediation analyses summary. In summary, these findings suggest that being teased for different types of gender nonconformity during youth may indirectly impact number of high-risk sex acts later in life via depression, although to a small degree. General, non-gay-specific teasing does not appear to be associated with number of high-risk sex acts later in life, either directly or indirectly. All types of teasing, however, appear to have a direct effect on number of high-risk sex partners even after accounting for depression and social anxiety, possibly reflecting a misguided search for approval and acceptance. Given that scales are available that measure motivations for sex, such as motivations to have sex to get approval from peers or to get approval from one's partners (e.g., Cooper, Shapiro, & Powers, 1998), it may be useful to examine the

!

27

!

motivations for sex among gay men who report a history of childhood teasing. There is a paucity of literature examining how motivations for sex are associated with high-risk sexual behaviour in gay and bisexual men; therefore more research is needed in this area. In the current study, the minority stress model was adapted to include sexual health outcomes as well as mental health problems as a consequence of minority distress. The results provide limited initial support that minority stress may be associated with negative sexual health outcomes as well as mental health outcomes. The finding that gay-specific teasing, but not general teasing, impacts number of high-risk sex acts via depression supports this extension of the minority stress model to include sexual health outcomes. However, in order to provide further support for extending this theoretical model to include sexual health outcomes among gay and bisexual men, it may be useful to examine other potential mediators that may be closely related to high-risk sexual behaviour not examined in the present study. Some examples of potential mediators that have been associated with high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men include internalized homophobia (Hatzenbuehler, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Erickson, 2008), sensation seeking (Bancroft, Carnes, & Janssen, 2005; Wim, Christiana, & Marie, 2013), self-efficacy for safer sex (Bedoya et al., 2012), posttraumatic stress symptoms (Reisner, Mimiaga, Safren, & Mayer, 2009), erectile dysfunction (Bancroft et al.), and alcohol and substance use (Bedoya et al., 2012; Jacobs et al., 2010; Mayer et al., 2012; Ostrow et al., 2009; Wim et al.). The minority stress model (Myer, 2003) proposes that there are two types of stressors that may contribute to negative psychological processes: distal and proximal. Distal stressors are those that the individual experiences in one's environment, and proximal stressors are those that occur within the individual in response to distal stressors. The current study examined the impact

!

28

!

of childhood victimization, a distal stressor, on sexual health outcomes. It is possible that using a proximal stressor such as internalized homophobia may provide further evidence in support of adapting this theoretical model to include sexual health outcomes as well as mental health outcomes. Although the minority stress model has previously focused on the impact of minority stressors on mental health outcomes, in extending this to include sexual health outcomes, it would be useful to consider other variables that are correlates of high-risk sex among gay and bisexual men, such as substance use (Hart et al., 2008). Hatzenbuehler's psychological mediation framework (Hatzenbuehler, 2009) proposes that the way experiences of minority stress become associated with mental health problems is via maladaptive psychological processes such as emotion dysregulation. Internalized homophobia is a type of maladaptive psychological process; therefore, examining it as a mediator between childhood victimization and adult high-risk sexual behaviour would not only provide further support for adapting the minority stress model to include sexual health outcomes, but would also provide support for extending the psychological mediation framework to include sexual health outcomes as well. Indeed, there is evidence that experiencing homophobic events in the past 12 months is associated with unprotected anal intercourse among both HIV-negative and HIV-positive gay men (Jeffries et al., 2013). It may therefore be useful to examine the impact of internalized homophobia and other proximal stressors on sexual health outcomes in the context of the minority stress model and Hatzenbuehler's psychological mediation framework. Limitations There are several limitations to the current study that relate to the self-report data. First, childhood teasing was assessed via retrospective self-report, and this period of retrospection ranged from 5 to 55 years, depending on the age of participants. It is possible that participants

!

29

!

did not accurately recall their childhood teasing experiences, or that their recall was biased or otherwise impacted by more recent life events. Because this period of retrospection ranged so greatly between participants, age may have been a confounding variable. It is possible that a stronger effect would have been observed in younger versus older participants, as memories of childhood teasing may be more salient among younger individuals. Second, participants were asked to self-report a stigmatized behaviour: unprotected anal intercourse. It is possible that participants underreported stigmatized behavior. However, to minimize this possibility, A-CASI was used to collect sexual behaviour data. As mentioned above, A-CASI has been shown to increase reporting of stigmatized behaviour over interviewer-administered face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires (Perlis et al., 2004; Tourangeau & Smith, 1996; Turner, 1998). Third, HIV status was used as a covariate in the mediation analyses, and was collected via self-report rather than a more invasive blood test. Approximately 19% of HIVpositive individuals in Canada may be unaware of their HIV status (PHAC, 2011); therefore even if all participants reported honestly, it is likely that some of those reporting to be HIVnegative were in fact HIV-positive. The impact of HIV status on sexual behaviour in the current study, therefore, more accurately reflects one's self-identity rather than one's biological HIV status, especially for the self-identified HIV-negative participants who may not know their actual HIV status. There are also some limitations unrelated to the use of self-report data. Several mediation analyses were conducted, thereby increasing the probability of a Type I error. If the current  of .05 were reduced to a more stringent  of .01, some of the results would have been rendered statistically non-significant. As a second methodological concern, the TQ-R has not been fully validated using a sample of gay men. The internal consistency and test-retest

!

30

!

reliability of the TQ-R were assessed for the current study, but its validity has not yet been demonstrated among this population. Future research using the TQ-R to examine the impact of teasing among sexual minority populations should include a full psychometric validation of the questionnaire among the populations of interest. Finally, it is possible that individuals who were teased during childhood for general or gay-specific reasons may continue to experience discrimination or stigmatization later in life. The current study did not assess present-day experiences of discrimination, which may have confounded the results. It is possible that what appears to be an effect of childhood teasing in the current study is in fact an effect of present-day discrimination or stigmatization. Future research should take current experiences of discrimination into account as a potential mediator of childhood teasing. Future Directions In the current study, childhood teasing was associated with having a greater number of high-risk sex partners, but the study design does not provide an explanation for why that is. Depression and social anxiety did not mediate the impact of teasing on number of high-risk sex partners; therefore, future research should examine other potential mechanisms, either through qualitative exploration or quantitative assessment. One potential mechanism mentioned above is the desire to gain approval or social acceptance. In general, research examining the impact of childhood teasing on high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men could benefit from examining individuals' motivations for sex, as there is currently a paucity of research in this area. There is evidence that specific motivations for sex have been associated with high-risk sexual behaviour among heterosexual young adults, including having sex to enhance physical or emotional pleasure, to please one's partner, and to cope with threats to self-esteem or avoid negative emotions (Cooper, Shapiro, & Powers, 1998). By better understanding why people

!

31

!

engage in high-risk sex, it may be possible to design more effective interventions to prevent HIV transmission or to target problematic attitudes or behaviours before they lead to high-risk sexual encounters. It may also be helpful for future research to compare the impact of childhood teasing on high-risk sexual behaviour between older versus younger cohorts of gay and bisexual men. Research has demonstrated that age may moderate predictors of high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men (Jacobs et al., 2010; Lelutiu-Weinberger et al., 2013). In addition, baseline rates of unprotected anal intercourse may not be equivalent across different age cohorts of gay and bisexual men. For example, research has demonstrated that frequency of sexual risk behaviour increases and peaks during young adulthood (Fergus, Zimmerman, & Caldwell, 2007). Alternatively, the cohort effect may be such that different generations that came of age in different socio-historical climates, or who experienced different types of peer victimization (online versus face-to-face) may react differently to victimization. Clinical Implications The current study has several clinical implications for gay and bisexual men. This study provides evidence that childhood teasing is associated with high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men later in life, albeit to a small degree. This suggests that campaigns to reduce peer bullying in childhood may have a far-reaching impact, potentially reducing behaviour that would place individuals at risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. In this way, anti-bullying campaigns may also contribute to HIV prevention efforts. In recent years, peer bullying has come into the spotlight, and anti-bullying campaigns have proliferated in the media and in schools. It is imperative that these continue in order to help reduce the experience of bullying in childhood and adolescence.

The impact of gay-specific teasing on number of high-risk sex acts was mediated by depression in the current study. This suggests that it may be particularly important for gay and bisexual men who report a history of gay-specific teasing during childhood to receive treatment for depression in order to reduce not only depressive symptoms, but also risk of contracting HIV. Clinicians working with gay and bisexual men at high risk for contracting or transmitting HIV should be aware to assess for depressive symptoms. The results of this study also suggest that clinicians working with gay and bisexual men should be aware of clients' experiences of minority stress, both past and present. Clinical assessments rarely delve beyond assessing for symptoms of common mental disorders; therefore, assessing for minority stressors may provide valuable additional information for case conceptualization and treatment planning.
