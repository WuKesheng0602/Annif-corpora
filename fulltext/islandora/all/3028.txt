Video games imply an enormous paradigm shift for our culture because they represent the first complex simulational media for the masses. - Gonzalo Frasca (224)

In October 2003, I received the approval of the Joint Programme in Communication & Culture to fulfill the requirements of the MA project by designing a prototype for a webbased video game which would provide an entertaining venue where players would learn about the mechanics behind the construction of masculinity. This prototype, along with a test scene (which can be played on most Internet-ready computers at www.sphincter.ca). was completed in August 2004. The purpose of this project paper is to elaborate on the project's objectives with a discussion of how theories of communication and culture guided the prototype's artistic direction, how the prototype contributes to the professional practice of video game design, and how the prototype's ultimate objective identity to help male wimps achieve a sense of comfort in their masculine

was fulfilled.

Video Games and Masculinity in the Twenty-first Century

The idea to design a prototype for a video game sprung from a paper I had been writing called "The Big Lebowski: A Mass-Produced Fantasy for Wimps" (see Appendix A for a copy), in which I take note of the emergent glorification of wimps in American and British television and film of the past 15 years, as seen in Seinfeld(1990-1998), The Larry Sanders Show (1992-1998), Being John Malkovich (1999), Election (1999), The Office (2000-2001), Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000-2004), Adaptation (2002), and American Splendour (2003). Bya wimp, I mean, as sociologist Michael Kimmel puts it, a male whose lack of "a 'sense of purpose,' including a sense of sexual purpose" (1996,294),

emasculates him in the face of the hegemonic dictum that real men are assertive, domineering, and virile. For the past 20 years, an era when "the structural foundations of traditional manhood - economic independence, geographic mobility, domestic dominance have all been eroding" (298-9), the wimp has become a marginalized

figure, as North American males have tried to cope with this "masculinity crisis" by suppressing signs of wimpiness in themselves and in other males. "Magazine articles and self-help books vie for men's attention, prescribing a wide variety of antidotes for gender troubles," Kimmel writes. "Many offer quick-fix solutions, continuing to bait us with the fear of the wimp, then sending us right back into the fray" (298). Journalist Susan Faludi writes, "[M]anhood is defined by appearance, by youth and attractiveness, by money and aggression, by posture and swagger and 'props,' by the curled lip and petulant sulk and flexed biceps, by the glamour of the cover boy, and by the marketbartered 'individuality' that sets one astronaut or athlete or gangster above another" (1999, 38-9). A backlash to this anti-wimp rhetoric is on the rise, however, and it's plainly evident in The Big Lebowski (1998), a film which invites male viewers to live vicariously through the Dude (Jeff Bridges), an extremely wimpy protagonist. (When asked by another character, "What do you do for recreation?" he replies, "Oh, the usual. Bowl, drive around, the occasional acid flashback.") In my Lebowski paper (Appendix A), I contend that the Dude's appeal derives in part from his simultaneous ability to be a "real man" (because he succumbs to the occasional act of physical or sexual masochism) and a "wimp" (because he clearly lives a life in perpetual fear of sexuality and all physical activity). When a wimp lives vicariously through the Dude, he feels like a "real

man" without having his wimpiness put to shame, and this is thus an empowering experience for the wimp who finds in the eoen brothers' film a comfortable route towards an affirmative masculinity.i This new masculinity appeals to a large number of male wimps, because it upholds their lack of a "sense of purpose" (a quality that is normally disparaged). While fascinated by this mechanism, I was also bothered that the film did not explicitly state that males should free themselves from (or at least be aware of) the imprisonment of gender politics. Thus, I decided to fulfill the requirements of my academic program by initiating a discourse with all Lebowski viewers out there who might find this conscious realization self-empowering. Initially, I was unsure of the form my inquiry would take. Although I was interested in contributing to the canon of masculinity studies, I decided against writing an academic thesis. The canon's impressive texts and Kimmel's Manhood in America (1996) including Faludi's Stiffed (1999)

had yet to reach Lebowskiviewers, and

thus an academic thesis would likely fail in that endeavour as well. Moreover, my target audience was not keen on consuming a direct polemiC on the masculinity crisis. I was also reluctant to present my views through a film, book, or television show, all of which tend to be either entertaining or informative, but rarely both. Movies, for example, tend to be either dramatic (e.g. Hollywood movies) or informative (e.g. documentaries), but I was looking for a media form which enabled me to reach a broad audience by appealing to them on an emotional level while simultaneously educating this audience with an explicit presentation of the thesis of my Lebowski paper. Then I started thinking about video games which, as it happened, fulfilled both of these requirements. Gaming

scholar Gonzalo Frasca argues that while all media are based on a semiotic structure of representation, video games are uniquely based on a semiotic structure of simulation (221-2). Video games are capable of reaching mass audiences due in part to the ways they represent real life, but they also educate players by allowing players to interact with the medium and to observe the moral impact of their own decisions. Although viewers of films and readers of novels are believed to be "active readers" insofar as they identify with protagonists and project themselves into their fantasy worlds, they do not experience simulations; they are at the mercy of the authors' whimsies and have no control over the order in which events appear let alone the wayan event plays itself

out. Video games distinguish themselves with "the 'feature' of allowing modifications to the stories" (227), enabling designers to construct their gameworlds in such ways that players can actively experience a simulated environment and thus more actively absorb the author's moral codes. When players turn on their XBox consoles, Frasca writes, they willingly submit to the moral rules bounding this system: "Mou must do X in order to reach Y and therefore become a winner. This implies that Y is a desired objective and therefore it is morally charged" (Frasca 230). For this reason, simulation is a much more effective rhetorical structure than representation, if by rhetoric we mean "the art of persuasion." As Plato informs us in The Phaedrus, speech is much more rhetorically effective than writing because when an individual is dialectically involved in the creation of knowledge, such knowledge "is written on the soul of the hearer together with understanding" (98), whereas a passive reader of such knowledge "will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on writing to bring things to their remembrance by external signs instead of their own internal resources" (96).

My decision to communicate through a video game was also influenced by my introduction to the 2-D animation program Macromedia Flash, which I had used to design some short films, and I became intrigued by the program's capacity to create interactive content, particularly games. (Over the past few years, Flash games have become hugely popular due in part to their integration with web browsers.) In my research of Flash games, I came across a series of disturbing games at a web site called "The Romp" (www.theromp.com). which chronicle the misogynistic adventures of an avatar named Jake. The object of the game is to watch Jake sexually harass women and homosexuals, and then, whenever Jake reaches a crossroads, to make the right decision between two options (e.g. go this way or that way), thus allowing Jake to carry on his loathsome way. Irritated by the game and its smugly self-proclaimed popularity, I decided to counteract it with a Flash game of my own. It was settled: I would design a prototype for a video game which would help males cope with the anxiety produced by the masculinity crisis. The therapeutic approach I took is explained in Freud's "Remembering, Repeating, and Working Through," in which Freud outlines a way of treating patients whose illnesses consist of unpleasant manifestations of a repressed trauma. The trauma, in the case at hand, was the male's shame for being unable to fulfill the ego-ideal of manhood, and it manifested itself in terms of moral anxiety. Following Freud, I took it that the male must be helped to "no longer regard the illness as something contemptible, but rather as a worthy opponent, a part of his very being that exists for good reasons, and from which he must extract something of real value for his subsequent life" (38). Freud suggests turning the shrink's office into a space where the patient's manifestations are treated as "harmless"

6

Page 7

and where the patient will consciously realize the source of his trauma so long as the analyst presents the treatment "as a playground in which it has licence to express itself with almost total freedom ... " (40). Interestingly enough, a video game lends itself to this process, creating a "playground" in which the masculinity crisis is revealed to the male, who can then use the game "to work his way through it, to overcome it by defying it" (41). I imagined the players of my video game coming to acknowledge the oppressive forces of hegemonic masculinity by observing how their decision-making affected the avatar's psychic energy. They would "win" the game, I figured, by ultimately rejecting hegemonic masculinity and becoming comfortable with their "wimpy" identity, at which point, the therapy session would be over. After surveying gaming scholarship, I was encouraged by the academy's overwhelming call for video game designers to produce progressive, gender-neutral content. After entering wide circulation more than 25 years ago, video games had recently begun to dominate North American entertainment, and for the past ten years or so, scholars and the public at large had begun producing a corpus of theory on their social role. In a 2002 Fast Company story, a journalist writes, 'Welcome to the entertainment industry of the 21 st century, where video games are serious business. Last year, U.S. computer- and video-game revenue surpassed domestic [film] box-office receipts, and this year, the game industry is expected to widen that gap with more than $10 billion in sales" (81). The popularity of video games is of huge concern, writes gaming scholar Henry Jenkins (1998), who notes that children's play spaces have changed from one in the 19th century of ravines and rolling hills to one in the 21 st century of carpeted living rooms, XBox consoles, and endless microworlds. Agreeing

7

with Frasca, Jenkins argues that video games set themselves off from movies and television shows through their allowance for interactive play: "A child playing a video game, searching for the path around obstacles or looking for an advantage over imaginary opponents, engages in some of the same 'mapping' activities as children searching for affordance in their real-life environments" (270). But it is shortSighted, he argues, to portray video games as a device spawning an unprecedented wave of misogyny. Drawing from Freud, Jenkins notes that our video game culture has inherited a legacy of boys' play spaces which have rewarded adolescent males for acts of aggression and, occasionally, misogyny. With the onset of the industrial revolution, 19 century boys were no longer needed to assist their fathers at work and were thus "left under the care of their mothers" (266). Whenever possible, boys dashed out into the open fields where they created a gaming environment that rejected both maternal values and the discipline of schooling in an effort to reclaim a sense of autonomy. Coinciding with this phenomenon, writes literary historian Joseph Bristow, is the cultural inscribing of militaristic and imperial ideology onto boys' psyches through the emerging genre of adventure novels. In late-19 th century Britain and North America, as literacy became increasingly valued by the middle class, an increasing number of boys were spending their childhoods receiving an education. "Schooling ... was supposed to be a model of efficiency," Bristow writes. It left very little room for creative development (except in the playground). In the 1870s, reading for pleasure, therefore, took place in leisure time rather than at school. Fictional narratives that absorbed the adventurous militarism of this new and rising imperial ideology now had a prime opportunity to enter into that comparatively unrestricted world: a world that belonged to the individual boy and not the school he went to" (27).

Writers of boys' adventure novels Thomas Arnold among them -

Robert Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, and

began writing stories which depicted their globetrotting

heroes fighting "the Other" in unconquered foreign lands; it is widely believed among scholars that these authors were implicitly calling on their young, male readers to become increasingly stoic and steadfast in the face of the British Empire's declining global influence (Honaker 28). Hence, these adventure stories helped to construct a cultural narrative in which boys became men by becoming aggressive and adventurous. Twenty-first century boys have inherited this adventurous legacy, Jenkins notes, but their terrain has become partially digital. A significant similarity between the play spaces of 19th century boys and 21 st century boys is that 19th century boy culture was guided by adult male writers concerned with the collapse of empire, while video games are largely produced by adult males concerned with the collapse of their sexual dominance. Stripped of their sex's onceimmense social advantage, these men turn to violence and misogyny in order to achieve instant domination over their social world (Faludi 38). Such dominance gets expressed, among other ways, in violent and misogynistic video games. Although films and television shows have started to produce socially progressive content with respect to gender, video games and their designers remain stuck in a chauvinistic time warp: Historically, gender was an unexploited category in video game design, with male designers developing games based on their own tastes and cultural assumptions without considering how these approaches might be anything other than gender-neutral. ... Yet as feminist critics note, as long as masculinity remains the invisible norm, the default set within a patriarchal culture, unselfconscious efforts are likely to simply perpetuate male dominance. (Cassell and Jenkins 25)

Masculinity is no longer the invisible norm, as films such as The Big Lebowski suggest; however, game designers have yet to treat masculinity as anything but. The gaming market remains disproportionately flooded with games perpetuating hegemonic masculinity. (The list of top-selling video game titles between January and June 2004 features games simulating some form of combat or another. ii ) Given that video games are a significant site of identity formation and are continuing the trend of encouraging young boys to adopt a distinctly aggressive masculinity, Jenkins believes that Western culture must do something to counteract this problem: Many of us might wish to foster a boy culture that allowed the expression of affection or the display of empowerment through nonviolent channels, that disentangled the development of personal autonomy from the fostering of misogyny, and that encouraged boys to develop a more nurturing, less domineering attitude to their social and natural environments. These goals are worth pursuing. (275-6)

An Alternative Model

After researching the masculinity crisis and its influence on video games, I decided to pursue Jenkins' prescribed goals through the development of an online game (online to make it accessible), which I hoped would be fun, entertaining and educational. A budding screenwriter, I wanted to map a game narrative onto the game design and I found encouragement in the writings of certain gaming scholars who believe that narrative is a fundamental element of educational game design. At a November 6, 2003 presentation by York University's Institute for Research on Learning Technologies, York professor and gaming scholar Jennifer Jenson delivered a paper with Suzanne de Castell in which they criticize the continual failure of scholars to make an educational game both entertaining and educational. Among several things lacking in these games,

10

Page 11

they note, is a gripping narrative, which would have helped immerse students in the gaming environment and, thus, the learning process. "[N]arratives," write Holland et al. "have the peculiar quality of making readers (players, viewers, interactors) care a great deal about the events they represent" (39). Most importantly, the stories we tell as a culture influence the construction of social identities. As literary scholar Thomas King puts it, "The truth about stories is that that's all we are" (92). King describes how the contemporary native North American has inherited an unenviable social identity from the stories of decades and centuries past which have reduced any person of native descent to a simplistic collection of character traits. In contemporary times, King writes, society as a whole expects native North Americans to adopt the "Indian identity" a person who, among other things, lives on a

reservation and wears feathers and animal skins. As for the natives who lie outside this narrow definition, they experience discrimination from both natives and non-natives should they refuse to conform. For reasons such as the one offered by King, gaming scholar Justine Cassell urges game designers to design their games around stories. [S]torytelling is an important activity for the construction of self, for the construction of the world, and for the construction of the norms by which we lead our lives, and thus an activity that encourages storytelling is a potential space for the maintenance of an identity that is not voiceless. In other words, I claim that storytelling might be the ur-place to raise one's voice gladly. (307) Stories our culture tells about men generally exclude the male wimp or have him learning to adopt a socially acceptable identity. Although certain works of recent film and television have affirmed the wimp, as discussed above, video games have yet to tell positive stories about wimps and their struggles to achieve a sense of pride in who

11

Page 12

they are. With this in mind, I decided that my game would tell the story of a wimp and his struggle to see his wimpiness not as a stigma, but as a source of pride. In an homage to Lebowski, I gave this wimp the last name of "Burkhalter," the name of the man in charge of scheduling at the bowling office (the film never actually shows us the character), and a first name of "Billy" "Billy" because I liked the

alliteration and thought it sounded funny. I then named the game Billy Burkhalter, the Maltese Man after Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon, in which the characters are all in search of a falcon whose enamel surface is concealing its body made of pure gold. At the novel's conclusion, detective Sam Spade hands over the falcon to the villainous Gutman who then makes a startling discovery: Gutman turned the bird upside-down and scraped an edge of its base with his knife. Black enamel came off in tiny curls, exposing blackened metal beneath. Gutman's knifeblade bit into the metal, turning back a thin curved shaving. The inside of the shaving, and the narrow plane its removal had left, had the soft grey sheen of lead. Gutman's breath hissed between his teeth. His face became turgid with hot blood. He twisted the bird around and hacked at its head. There too the edge of his knife bared lead. He let knife and bird bang down on the table where he wheeled to confront Spade. "It's a fake," he said hoarsely. The game's name reflected my attempt to suggest that all men are like that falcon that Gutman gutted. Many wimps believe that if they should chip away at their wimpy surfaces, they would find underneath a masculinity made of gold; however, this is a false notion. Although the prevailing middle-class belief "in the likelihood of selfimprovement if you'll just hurl yourself into it" (Fussell 43) suggests that each and every male out there has the potential to become the ideal man confident, cool, and virile

a wimp who attempts to shed his wimpy identity for a more ideal masculinity and this self will eventually resurface in an unpleasant

manifestation. The wimp who sheds his wimpy identity for the ideal masculinity will be sorely disappointed, much in the same way Gutman and his cohorts are disappointed that there is no golden body underneath the Maltese Falcon's skin. The wimp should instead ignore the pressure to become the ideal man and should rather become comfortable with his wimpiness.

Although digital technology enables game designers to construct interactive storytelling, I decided to design my game around a non-interactive, linear story. A story which affirmed the wimp was essential to my game, and I did not want players constructing alternative narratives which contained negative portrayals of wimps. The game thus fell under the category of what game developer Chris Crawford (2003) calls "games alternating with stories": "You interact with the nonnarrative game, then see some noninteractive story, then interact some more with the game, then see more story" (260). One of the more popular examples of this genre of games are the Sierra On-Line games produced in the 1980s and early 1990s, all of which contained relatively positive gender representations. It was thus a model worth investigating. Cassell and Jenkins believe that "[t]he arrival of games from the small company Sierra On-Line changed things somewhat" (9), having inspired game designers to produce gender-neutral games in increasingly large numbers. The 19 games from Sierra found mainly in were

their King's Quest, Police Quest, Space Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry series -

"adventure games," games which simulate an adventure experience and require players to make the decisions which allowed their avatars to see a quest through to its completion. In King's Quest IV, "The Perils of Rosella," the player controlled Rosella, a

13

Springer Project Paper, Third Draft

"Billy Burkhalter, the Maltese Man: A Video Game for Wimps"

Page 14

woman marooned on a beautiful yet deadly island and whose history is a complete mystery. The player guided Rosella across the island, encountering characters both devious and delightful as he or she typed in various commands (e.g. look at object; talk to man; ride unicorn; dive underwater; throw water at witch) in order to manipulate Rosella's way to freedom. In the Sierra adventure model, players interacted with their everyday environment (e.g. read this magazine, not that one; watch this television show, not that one; talk this way to the woman, not that way, etc.). Given that I wanted players to reflect upon the effects that their everyday decisions have on the construction of gender, I designed my game around the Sierra model. The model enabled me to immerse players in an everyday world where they could not pretend that gender is invisible. In the script, for example, I gave players access only to those objects which reminded Billy of his wimpy identity. The goal of those burdened with a marginal identity is to convince the people in their social environment that their identity is not unnatural, but just as normal as anyone else's. A strategy they often take in order to achieve this goal is to produce what Linda Hutcheon calls a "postmodern parody." The term "parody" is generally assigned to a text in which the author has mimicked the form of another text in an effort to make light of it. A "postmodern parody," writes Hutcheon, mimics the form of the original text, but also "ironically contextualizes it" (89-113). In other words, by borrowing the text's privileged form and replacing its privileged content with marginalized content, the author of a postmodern parody makes a symbolic statement; she or he contests the social privilege of the original content and suggests that the original content is arbitrarily naturalized and is as equally "normal" as the marginalized content of the parody.

Page 15

Hutcheon departs from the standard postmodernist theory of identity which claims "that in postmodern culture, the subject has disintegrated into a flux of euphoric intensities, fragmented and disconnected, and that the decentred postmodern self no longer experiences anxiety ... " (Kellner 144). In his analysis of popular culture, Douglas Kellner criticizes postmodernism's totalizing characterization of contemporary identity and demonstrates that social identity continues to structure the way in which people interact with their environment (174). That said, he acknowledges that the diversification of identities in contemporary culture does offer people suffering from an identity crisis an increasing amount of latitude and choice in their attempt to construct a recognizable identity. People's identities do enter periods of flux, but only when they are transforming from one identity to another. The identities on display in postmodern parodies are only temporary manifestations; their subjects use the parody only to affirm their fixed social identity. Playwright and performance artist Deb Margolin offers a similar definition of parody, defining it as: " ... the direct result of an attempt to make room for oneself within an airtight, closed, or exclusive social, cultural, or theatrical construct. ... A kind of aria of the poor. It is an inherently ridiculous act, like a woman in a housedress crashing a fancy party. That's why, although not all parody is funny, parody is considered a subset of comedy. Parody is a desperate act of love, it does not exist without some form of love, of passion, of desire. (248) Although my parody was trying to be funny, just as Margolin is trying to be funny during her performances, I was not producing a work of kitsch. Kitsch, as most scholars define it, is a text empty of any statements of social significance, and is produced with the intention of eliciting an emotional response from its reader. My prototype did resemble

to a set of films released between 1941's The Maltese Falcon and 1959's Touch of Evil, which are characterised by a dangerous urban setting filled with shadows and harsh contrasts, and which explore themes of male alienation and loneliness through a hardboiled male protagonist (sometimes a private detective) who's positioned against corruption, emasculating bureaucracy, weak-minded males and femme fatales. Frank Krutnik has observed that films nair were haunted by the bleak, pessimistic theme that the traditional routes towards the ideal American masculinity had evaporated. After a decade of economic depression, the Second World War, and an influx of women in the workforce, American males experienced a heightened threat to their manhood. Film nair, however, encourages males to reclaim their dominance through anti-social behaviour and misogyny and it overtly privileges the hard-boiled loner over the wimp. Nair has not faded away; its influences endure in contemporary films (e.g. Chinatown [1971], Blue Velvet [1982], Blade Runner [1983], Blood Simple [1984], Miller's Crossing [1990], Barton Fink [1991], L.A. Confidential [1997], Lost Highway [1997], A Simple Plan [1998], Fight Club [1999], BMM [1999], The Man Who Wasn't There [2001]) as well as in video games, all of which have parodied nair in an effort to re-present themes of male alienation. The term game nair recently gained currency among gamers and gaming scholars who have used it to describe such popular games as Max Payne and Grim Fandago, in which the designers have mapped film noirs central features (a story set in a dark, urban environment featuring a hard-boiled, alienated male protagonist pitted against a femme fatale, ill-willed males and an all-out corrupt society) onto a computer adventure game. Their popularity is understandable, Galen Davis argues in "Game Nair. The Construction of Virtual Subjectivity in Computer

Gaming" (2002), because game nair is a camplementary fusian of the form of the computer game with the genre of nair. Both, he observes, call attention to the fragmentation of the self: nair with its exploration of the male's tenuous hold on his masculinity; computer games with their requirement that players masquerade as someone else while they play. Drawing on Davis' argument, I contend that when the player is playing a game nair, the nair-ish qualities stir his repressed anxieties, while the form of the computer game allows the player to confront these anxieties by taking on the identity of a hard-boiled male protagonist. Although the game nair Max Payne is popular among gamers, I found it an unsuitable model for my project since it encouraged players to transfer their anxiety into bloodshed. I decided instead that game nair was an appropriate object of parody for my prototype, because its conventions signalled to audiences that the game was exploring the masculinity crisis. Moreover, by substituting a wimp in for the hard-boiled protagonist, I was also criticizing noir for presenting the hard-boiled male as a solution to the masculinity crisis. My parody of nair satirized its maxim that if a man works hard enough, if he expunges himself of sentiment, and if he deprives himself of all bodily pleasures, he can become the ideal man: confident, self-made, tough, and honest. By playing the game, players would come to reject the myth that a man can easily fulfill the requirements of ideal manhood by simply hoisting himself above his oppressive, material conditions. Billy Burkhalter the avatar the player controlled was modelled on the Dude Howard

(from The Big Lebawskl). Lebawski is a parody of The Big Sleep (1946) Hawks' film nair based on the novel by Raymond Chandler -

and the Dude is a parody

of Chandler's detective Philip Marlowe. The Dude possesses all the features of a nair

protagonist -

he mutes his fears through a "strict drug regimen," he's a wisecrack and with one

a loner, he's afraid of sexuality, and he feels alienated in an urban world -

notable exception: he is a wimp. Unlike the Dude, who has no sense of purpose and refuses to exert himself, Marlowe is driven by a desire to restore male potency in his culture. As Krutnik informs us, the nair tough-guy attempts to achieve this by expunging feminine characteristics from himself and by relinquishing all dependence on females. He believes, for example, that his erotic desires for women turn him into a "sottee" and might make him emotionally reliant on women, which provokes him to project negative character traits onto any women he desires in order to repress his longing for her. On his first encounter with femme fatale Vivian Regan, he writes, "She was worth a stare. She was trouble. She was stretched out on a modernistic chaise-lounge with her slippers off, so I stared at her legs in the sheerest silk stockings. They seemed to be arranged to stare at" (28). Although the Dude does not demonize the women he's attracted to, he represses the fact that he is a sexual being. As I observe in my Lebowski paper: That the Dude cherishes sex for its own sake is a fact he keeps from himself and the Coens keep from the audience - given their heightened fear of it. In his scene with Jackie Treehorn [Ben Gazarra], Treehorn receives a phone call, scribbles something on a pad, removes the top piece of paper, and exits. Curious, the Dude sprints up to the message pad, takes a pencil, and lightly runs over it, revealing what Treehorn had scribbled: a sketch of a man with an enormous erection. The film shows the Dude's flabbergasted expression, then returns to his POV: an extreme close-up of Treehorn's sketch, which looks as though it was drawn by a French Impressionist and is framed as though it were on an artist's canvas. But can a pornographer be an artist? Is sex valuable for its own sake - not solely for the sake of reproduction? This is a powerful, visceral moment, because it allows the Dude and the male audience to experience momentarily a man's sexuality as pleasurable in and of itself - without their conscious knowledge.

Determined to have players consciously realize that they are afraid of sexuality, I decided to make Billy a parody of the Dude. Billy possessed the Dude's core features, as listed above, but he was also consciously aware of his fears of sexual expression and physical self-assertion. Billy explained his problem to Diane Sawyer during their interview in the script's opening sequence:

DIANE SAWYER: What stresses you out? BILLY: Well, sex. On account of my Catholic upbringing. Violence. On account of being abused by my brother Warren. Fortunately, I find solace in drugs, booze, classic rock, and social avoidance. OS: Must be tough balancing your stress level with your self-esteem level. B: You've hit the snail on the shell, Diane.

Billy was conflicted, as Diane Sawyer suggested, because sexual expression and physical self-assertion are required for entry into manhood in our culture. This struggle is one which, as argued in the Lebowski paper [see Appendix A], haunts all wimps and thus plays an extremely meaningful role in their lives. Each action that a wimp makes is made in order to keep his stress level at a manageable low and his self-esteem level at a manageable high; that said, the wimp often finds himself forced to make a decision that helps one level, but hurts another. Thus, the wimp weighs his every move carefully, taking into account not only the actions' potential effect on his levels, but also the current status of each level. If his self-esteem and stress levels are low, then he may be willing to engage in sexual activity. In such an instance, he sacrifices his stress level in order to rescue his low self-esteem level.

I decided to map this system of actions and reactions onto the gameplay of my prototype. I came to this decision from a therapeutic point of view, given that the central objective of this prototype was to encourage wimps to stop repressing their fears and to stop seeing their wimpy identities with a sense of shame. A simulation of male wimpiness did not criticize the wimp's conflicted mind, but treated it as a common problem which required the wimp's utmost attention. This type of design was appropriate from a design point of view as well. A simulation of male wimpiness had the potential to generate a consistent yet mysterious system which would attract players curious to see if they were capable of figuring out how to integrate one's wimpy identity into the social world. Although wimpiness is an undesirable identity trait, players would see the game as distinct from a real-life experience of male wimpiness. Certain gaming scholars have described game simulations as being purely immersive, i.e. when the player's avatar is kicking an opponent's avatar in the face, the player believes that it is actually him- or herself who is doing the kicking (Laramee). If such were the case, no one would ever play my game given that wimpiness is largely perceived as being an undesirable identity trait. In opposition to this claim, Salen and Zimmerman write: A teen kissing another teen in Spin the Bottle or a Gran Turismo player driving a virtual race car each understands that their play references other realities. But the very thing that makes their activity play is that they also know they are participating within a constructed reality, and are consciously taking on the artificial meanings of the magic circle. iii It is possible to say that the players of a game are "immersed" - immersed in meaning. (452) The immersion of meaning which one experiences when they masquerade as a wimp relates to the earlier discussion concerning the pleasure one receives from parody.

"The loss of the sense of 'the normal,'" Butler writes, "can be its own occasion for laughter, especially when 'the normal,' 'the original' is revealed to be a copy, and an inevitably failed one, an ideal that no one can embody. In this sense, laughter emerges in the realization that all along the original was derived" (138-9). I hoped that the enjoyment behind playing Billy Burkhalter: The Maltese Man would derive Similarly from the player's sudden awareness that the ideal masculinity is both unattainable given

the wimp's psychic structure - and undesirable - given the way in which dominant masculinities are portrayed throughout the game. It should be noted that I did not design the game with the intention of privileging the wimpy identity above all other identities, but with the intention of helping the wimpy identity to achieve social recognition. I did not want the game to encourage people to become idle slackers, but I realized that players might interpret the game as doing exactly this. Indeed, as I reflect upon the game design, I realize that I presented Billy as a rebel against not only hegemonic masculinity, but also the upper-middle social class. Billy lived in a broken-down apartment without the middle-class symbols of cultural capital (e.g. posters of fine art hanging on the wall). He was not well-groomed (tattered clothes, shaggy hair), and he worked for a pittance at a part-time job. The prototype thus contained a problematic conflation of masculinity and class. In his comparison of the novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and its film adaptation, Purple Noon, film scholar Chris Straayer observes that the former distinguishes between class and masculinity, whereas the latter suggests that a person's masculinity reflects his social class and vice versa. In my prototype, I had inadvertently suggested that hegemonic masculinity belongs to the upper-middle social class - and not to any other class. This, of course,

22

Springer Project Paper, Third Draft

"Billy Burkhalter, the Maltese Man: A Video Game for Wimps"

Page 23

is a false notion -

there are working-class, middle-class, and upper-class hegemonic

masculinities, as well- and, if I redesigned the game, I would present Billy as someone whose class was less saliently obvious. The game was not an entire endorsement of the lower-middle class, however; at the end of the story, Billy transcends his class by marrying Vivian, a successful television producer, and becoming a stay-at-home dad. The game was becoming a parody of, not only the film nair genre, but also the adventure genre and the video game in general. Nineteenth-century adventure stories for boys, writes Richard Phillips, "mapped masculinities" through geography. "Masculinities mapped in the geography of adventure reflect[ed] characteristics of that geography" (18). A man's place was charted not in the home, but on the high seas and in dangerous, foreign lands, and the geographical characteristics of such places were mapped onto the masculinities of boys and men, all of whom were increasingly expected to become robust and swashbuckling, intimidating and mysterious. Twentyfirst century adventure video games repeat this trend, inserting their male heroes into equally daunting and magnificent territories. The most popular games on the market today chart masculinity in outer space, football stadiums, and vast, imaginative lands. In my prototype, I mimicked the adventure form, giving players a territory to explore, but I reduced the conventional volume of this space. Criticizing the male's desire to transcend his emasculating, domestic environment through the fantasy of an adventure story, I placed the avatar in his tiny apartment and other confined spaces where the player was forced to examine Billy's immediate social world. Stories themselves are tools of repression and, thus, I wrote the prototype's story as a parody of conventional

23

Springer Project Paper, Third Draft

"Billy Burkhalter, the Maltese Man: A Video Game for Wimps"

Page 24

adventure storytelling (for a plot outline, see Appendix B; for the script, see Appendix D). A sprawling mess, the story was logically sound yet so complex that it held all but no one's attention. By the end of this yarn, the player was expected to be no longer caught up in the supposed fantasy it provided, but to be thinking about the story's metanarrative, which criticized the use of story to legitimate oppressive ideologies. The player's focus was directed not towards the story, but towards the non-narrative, interactive tasks which connected each narrative cutscene. For example, starting between the moments when the Billy wakens at the end of first cutscene and when he leaves his apartment, Billy is unable to leave the apartment until he feels both confident (high self-esteem) and calm (low stress). I divided Billy's metres into three regions and 10 notches: calm (notches 1-5), anxious (6-9), delirious (10); wimpy (1), timid (2-5), confident (6-10). If Billy felt both calm and confident, he could leave the apartment, but if he felt either anxious or timid, he could not, and if he ever felt delirious or wimpy, the player would lose and would be forced to quit the game or start over. A further tool of repression in video games is its euphoric pace, which requires players to be extremely focused and alert, constantly acting and reacting to the environment, and removed from everyday life. By confining the avatar to a tiny space, in which the player must figure out how to negotiate between social pressure and personal desire, the player was forced to confront the repressions that video games often provide an escape from. At the outset of the game, in Billy's apartment, the player experienced a leisurely pace as he decided whether or not to read magazines, watch televisions, have a shower, clean the bathroom, smoke a joint, eat cereal, open the

refrigerator, or drink vodka and sangria. This game forced players to confront the fact that these activities affect our emotional stability.

Page 26

I developed my parody of noir by writing a story in which Billy is pitted against hordes of male villains lurking in the shadows. In film noir, the private investigator is "[tested] in relation to other men: as partners, adversaries or representatives of legal or patriarchal law" (Krutnik 165), and thus the purpose of the male villains' inclusion in my game was to provide a standard against which the viewer could measure the protagonist's masculinity. Each villain was a parody of an archetypal masculinity: the aging Brit seeking to resurrect his country's imperial heritage; the white, upper-middle class capitalist obsessed with efficiency; the pretentious artist; the annoying, attentionseeking comedian; the sneering, overtly sexual clubgoer; and the narcissistic bodybuilder. Through a careful use of language, I built each character's dialogue around a collection of two-dimensional, stock phrases in order to suggest that each masculinity is a vacuous performance resulting from each man's flawed attempt to fulfill the requirements of contemporary manhood. Females received a different treatment. The femme fatale usually represents male paranoia of a feminine invasion of the patriarchy; here, the femme fatale, Vivian Sullivan, was someone Billy initially feared (because he was attracted to her), even though she had no interest in exploiting him. Instead, she and Billy developed a romantic relationship, and Billy discovered that to be "in love," to be full of sentiment, was not an affront to his manhood, as male chauvinists like to suggest, but one of life's pleasures. Mapping the noir convention of male posturing onto a contemporary context, I decided that Billy should become a contestant on a reality television show, a genre in which the male contestants usually compete against members of the same sex in an

26

Springer Project Paper, Third Draft

"Billy Burkhalter, the Maltese Man: A Video Game for Wimps"

Page 27

effort to become crowned "most man." Ever since Survivor, reality television has allowed audiences to elect their favourite males and females and to vote off their

least favourite. Their voting strategies are usually based upon stereotypically gendered criteria, i.e. who's the most man and most woman? Given that the genre of reality television excludes the wimp, the game became a parody of reality television, as well. Calling attention to the fact that reality television reaffirms hegemonic masculinity, I called the game show Who's the Most Man? On this show, the home viewers decided if a male contestant is more man than the show's team of "supermen." Each superman represented a particular social sphere in which contemporary males are expected to dominate: the office, the gym, the club, the artist's studio, and the comedian's stage. For each night of the week (Monday to Friday), the show's producers gave Billy and each superman a task and whoever performed each task the best received the

audience's vote. For example, Billy and the office guy were put through a series of situations from a not-so-typical day at the office, including one in which a boss entered the office guy and barked, "Stevenson! Your department's responsible for maintaining efficiency. And yet the boys down in engineering say they're three weeks behind schedule on the new palm pilot design. I swear, I'm this close to a coronary!" The office guy replied, "Sir, you're not going to have a coronary. That's because I've got our boys working round the clock on this thing. They're not even going to take bathroom breaks -I've got them wearing diapers." In this instance, I parodied reality television in order to satirize 21 st century capitalism. Reality shows such as The Apprentice privilege the heirs to Donald Trump's throne and their Machiavellian designs. Here, by presenting a business executive who forces his employees to wear diapers, I

27

Page 28

challenged the self-proclaimed moral fortitude of big business. The five remaining situations challenged the self-proclaimed superiority of (in chronological order) the gym, the night club, the artist's studio, and the comedian's stage. I exposed the cultural norms that males who succeed in these activities are "real men" and that wimps should aspire to succeed in each one.
Conclusion: Production of the Test Scene

When I had finished designing the prototype in mid-May, I proceeded to produce a test scene based on the script's first nine pages. In the test scene, the player went to the web site www.sphincter.ca. which contained a hypertext link to a separate window. (Upon clicking the link, the player watched a pre-loader screen as the player's computer downloaded the introduction into his or her computer. The pre-loader then dissolved to an interview between Diane Sawyer and Billy Burkhalter, in which Billy explained how the game works. Throughout these instructions, the player had the option to click "skip this shit" and jump straight to the next scene, the interactive moments between when Billy wakes up and when he leaves his apartment for the first time.) In order to complete the test scene, I cast actors, directed them through their lines, recorded their voices in a studio, selected music and sound effects, constructed an audio track, designed the graphics [for a copy of the sketches, see Appendix E], married the audio and visual tracks, and wrote the actionscript (Le. program the game). A graduate of Ryerson University's Radio & Television Arts program, I was proficient in each of the above tasks with the exception of computer programming. Before this project began, I had never heard of actionscript and I learned this programming language largely

28

Page 29

through the help of Internet message boards. (See Appendix C for a transcript of sessions at a web site called "flashkit.com.") The purpose of creating a test scene was to gauge whether or not the prototype had successfully fulfilled its objectives. I tested the scene on dozens of people and I received reports of a positive gaming experience. My supervisor, Jerry Durlak, offered several suggestions, from both an aesthetic and a technical standpoint, all of which enhanced the player's ability to interact with the game. The test scene was uploaded to the web in June 2004 and underwent several revisions in the months of August and September. It is presently is available at www.sphincter.ca. which will serve as the official home page of Billy Burkhalter, the
Maltese Man. (The completed game has a tentative launch date of October 15th .) The

American Heritage Dictionary defines "sphincter" as the "ringlike muscle that normally maintains constriction of a body passage or orifice and that relaxes as required by normal physiological functioning." The domain name plays off the slang word, "tightass," and signals to visitors of this site that they should relax their sphincter muscles before entering. In order for the wimp to achieve social recognition, society must learn to relax its definitions of what it means to be a man. As the Dude puts it in his farewell speech at the end of The Big Lebowski, "The Dude abides." This project has been my attempt to help both wimps and society at large to abide the wimpy identity.

Appendix A: "The Big Lebowski: A Mass-Produced Fantasy for Wimps" By Sean Springer

In the opening scene of Joel and Ethan eoen's The Big Lebowski (1998), the huskyvoiced narrator (Sam Elliott) endorses a peculiar brand of masculinity. "A way out west there was this fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. ... This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude," he says in a slow, southern drawl over tracking shots of urban and rural Los Angeles. Now this a'here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eyerackies. I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man - I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro? - but sometimes there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here - sometimes there's a man, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there - and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. The Dude (Jeff Bridges) represents a peculiar paradigm because, as a conversation with a character named Maude (Julianne Moore) suggests, he has not lived the life of achievement that typically defines the ideal man (Faludi, 1999). MAUDE: Tell me about yourself, Jeffrey. DUDE: Uh .... Not much to tell. I, um, I was one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement - The original Port Huron Statement. Not the compromised second draft. Uh, and then I, uh - you ever hear of the Seattle Seven?

MAUDE: Mmnun. DUDE: That was me ... There were six other guys. Uh, and then, uh ... music business briefly.

MAUDE: Oh?

1

DUDE:

Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.

MAUDE: Mmm. DUDE: Bunch of assholes. And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's slowed down a bit lately.

MAUDE: What do you do for recreation? DUDE: Oh, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.

The Dude is an American male wary of having an active lifestyle. In other words, he is a wimp. "A wimp lacks a 'sense of purpose,'" Kimmel writes, "including a sense of sexual purpose" (1996, 294). Once celebrated as the "new man" of the 1970s, the sensitive wimp has since found himself in a culture that has increasingly sought to transform him into an assertive and domineering individual. In an era when "the structural foundations of traditional manhood mobility, domestic dominance economic independence, geographic

have all been eroding" (298-9), American males have

attempted to restore their masculinity by suppressing signs of wimpiness in themselves and in other males. "Magazine articles and self-help books vie for men's attention, prescribing a wide variety of antidotes for gender troubles. Many offer quick-fix solutions, continuing to bait us with the fear of the wimp, then sending us right back into the fray" (298). Films have likewise been dominated by the glorification of the ambitious, self-made male protagonist; film theorists note such a trend in a number of films from the past fifteen years 1 (Byers [1996], Gabbard [2001], Goddard [2000], Malin [2003], Nilsson [2000], Stukator [1997]). In Field of Dreams (1989), Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinsella, a farmer who overcomes major adversity en route to building an arena for the performance of

hegemonic American masculinity -

a baseball park (Nilsson). Unlike Kinsella, the

Dude does not build anything in Lebowski, which is why the Dude is such a unique and remarkable solution to the contemporary masculinity crisis. And although Maude herself is unimpressed with the Dude's curriculum vitae, the film's immense popularity last summer more than a thousand people spent a weekend in Louisville to celebrate implies that

"all things Lebowski" at the second annual Lebowski Fest (Yost, 2003) -

the eoen brothers have constructed a film which presents a plausible route towards the ideal masculinity. This alternative to the ideal masculinity is similar to the one Desser sees in Jewish characters of popular television from the past two decades. According to Desser, Jewish characters of the late twentieth century have been represented in popular television as stereotypically "urban, weak, frail, and intellectual" qualities that

have historically been assigned to Jewish men as a way to oppress them. In these recent television characters, however, "in inhabiting these roles they now become sexually desirable and potent, not only heterosexually, but along interracial, interethnic lines, as well" (2001, 271). The thesis of this paper overlaps with that of Desser's, arguing that a new masculinity has emerged in popular culture of recent years which appeals to a large number of male wimps, because it upholds their lack of a "sense of purpose" (a quality that is normally disparaged), thus creating a subculture within popular culture that actually celebrates the wimp. The wimpy route is found in a handful of television series and films of the 1990s and 2000s, including Seinfeld (1990 - 1998),
The Larry Sanders Show (1992 - 1998), Being John Malkovich (1999), Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000 - 2003), Adaptation (2002), and American Splendour (2003).

Represented by male protagonists of a multiplicity of ethnicities, this wimpy masculinity

3

is glorified precisely because the protagonists are wary of asserting themselves sexually and aggressively. According to Gill, In ten decades of films, the noble leader, the solitary cowboy, the brave soldier, the idealistic cop, the devoted priest, and the loyal servant have suffered and prevailed in moral if not always in material terms. As the notion of what constitutes a morally acceptable protagonist has expanded over the years to include cynical, hard-boiled detectives and brutal, alienated loners, the notion of what constitutes a morally acceptable solution has expanded along with it. (2003, 157) These males must all suffer in order to gain entry into manhood, writes Gill, who sees in films of the past dozen years a different kind of suffering protagonist. "In these films of suffering men, 2 protagonists despair at what they feel and suspect about themselves, and despair prompts them to agonized acts of displacement and amelioration" (160). These protagonists rarely find salvation and their films have a chilling forecast regarding the mental stability of American males. Much like the narrator from Fight Club (1999), the Dude also experiences feelings of alienation in one scene he calls himself "a however,

loser, a deadbeat, someone the square community won't give a shit about" -

he does not agonize over his displacement so much as he revels in it. Unlike "the narrator," the Dude is presented as a viable route towards the ideal masculinity. Indeed, as this essay attempts to demonstrate, to the list of solutions to the masculinity crisis "the noble leader, the solitary cowboy, the brave soldier, the idealistic cop, the
Lebowski adds a version of the wimp -

devoted priest, and the loyal servant" "wimpy slug."

The wimpy slug is tailor-made for the contemporary American crisis in masculinity. In her book Stiffed, Faludi argues that, in the late-twentieth century, American males have been increasingly expected to prove themselves on two playing fields: aggression and vanity. "All the pillars of the male paradigm [have] fallen except the search for the enemy," writes Faludi (31-2), adding elsewhere, [M]anhood is defined by appearance, by youth and attractiveness, by money and aggression, by posture and swagger and 'props,' by the curled lip and petulant sulk and flexed biceps, by the glamour of the cover boy, and by the market-bartered 'individuality' that sets one astronaut or athlete or gangster above another. (38-9) For Faludi, the wellspring of aggressive and glamorous males is located in southern California, the home of both Hollywood and a thriving gang culture (46). Not . coincidentally, the Coen brothers set Lebowski in Los Angeles during the outbreak of the first Gulf War, which, according to the narrator, makes the Dude "the man for his time'n place" as opposed to the man of his time'n place. As writers, directors, producers, and editors of Lebowski, the Coen brothers present the Dude as an antidote to Los Angeles in 1991 a time and place in which males are constantly reminded to

assert themselves sexually and aggressively. As Faludi informs us, this state of affairs has become a source of anxiety for so many American males, and it is these males these "wimps" who want to be accepted "as men" without having to compromise their wimpiness who find solace by living vicariously through the Dude's sluggish

masculinity. The purpose of this paper is to explore and describe the performance of this unusual masculinity and to explain precisely why it appeals to the contemporary North American wimp.

In order to establish the prevalence of "the male paradigm of confrontation" (Faludi 604), the Coens surround the Dude with a discourse of men crying out for "the enemy." In his first scene, the Dude stands in a checkout line watching a George H.W. Bush news conference on a television monitor. "This aggression will not stand. This aggression against Kuwait will not stand," declares Bush - whose war mongering, Kimmel writes, was an attempt to fend off accusations of seeming ''wimpy'' (297). The Dude's closest friend, Walter (John Goodman), is a Vietnam War vet who demands respect, because he's "a fuckin' veteran!" He informs the Dude that "pacifism is not something to stand behind," he takes every opportunity to pick a fight, and he criticizes Bush because Iraq, unlike Vietnam, "is not a worthy adversary." John Turturro steals two scenes playing bowler Jesus Quintana, who loves to intimidate the Dude and his bowling partners Walter and Donny (Steve Buscemi). A host of male characters the

three nihilists (Peter Stormare, Flea, Torsten Voges), the cab driver (Ajgie Kirkland), the Malibu Chief of Police (Leon Russom), Jackie Treehom's thugs (Philip Moon and Mark Pellegrino) is in search of enemies against whom each can demonstrate his

manhood. Their beefs, quarrels, and scores to settle are always petty, which reflects deriSively on their characters. During a bowling match, Walter notices his opponent's foot slip over the lane marking, which sparks a heated argument. When the opponent, Smokey (Jimmie Dale Gilmore), refuses to mark his score a zero, Walter pulls out a gun, puts it to Smokey's head, and says, "You think I'm fuckin' around, here? Mark it zero!"

As a pacifist, the Dude stands out favourably in stark contrast to every other male character much in the way the hard-boiled private investigator of film noir is "[tested]

in relation to other men: as partners, adversaries or representatives of legal or patriarchal law" (Krutnik 1991, 165). In fact, The Big Lebowski is a parody of The Big

Sleep (1946), the film noir directed by Howard Hawks and starring Humphrey Bogart as
private detective Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as Vivian Rutledge. According to several scholars, notably Frank Krutnik, films noir are haunted by the bleak, pessimistic theme that the traditional routes towards the ideal American masculinity had evaporated. After a decade of economic depression, the Second World War, and an influx of women in the workforce, American males experienced a heightened threat to their manhood. That there was such a market for these dissonant and schismatic representations of masculinity, as is suggested by the sheer number of noir 'tough' thrillers in the mid-to-Iate 1940s, is perhaps evidence of some kind of crisis of confidence within the contemporary regimentation of maledominated culture. (1991, 91) Marlowe and the Dude are entwined in similar stories. Both are working for an elderly, wheelchair-bound war veteran; a young blonde bombshell mixed up in a pomography ring sexually propositions them both; both indulge in a romantic affair with a mysterious woman; and both of their stories are complex, each leaving loose strands of narrative untied. Moreover, Lebowski maps Marlowe's hard-boiled exterior onto the Dude, who possesses Marlowe's penchant for wisecracks and his masochistic indifference to torture. Such traits help Marlowe and the Dude sustain masculine autonomy in their respective cultures, both of which have been shown to impinge on their masculinities. In an early scene, Jackie Treehorn's thugs, mistaking the Dude for an aging millionaire

7

also named Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston), break into the Dude's dingy apartment, dunk his head into a toilet, and demand that he cover money owed to their boss (Ben Gazzara) by Bunny (Tara Reid), Lebowski's wife. The Dude controls the conversation with male posturing. Holding a bowling ball, the blond-haired thug asks, "The fuck is this?" The Dude replies, "Obviously, you're not a golfer."

Lebowski, however, does not compromise the Dude's lack of a "sense of
purpose"; unlike Marlowe, the Dude refuses to assert himself at all. He is not a hardboiled detective, but is rather a hard-boiled wimp. Whereas Marlowe grudgingly gets out of bed in the morning, only persuasion and coercion can force the Dude to leave the blissful confines of his bathtub. The routes towards manhood have crumbled to a point where, the Coens suggest, the American male should remove himself from society completely. The Coens present this argument by satirizing one character in particular, the elderly Lebowski, who in one scene explicitly informs the Dude that male assertion is the ideal masculinity. It's funny. I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. What - what makes a man, Mr. Lebowski? ... Is it being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the cost? Isn't that what makes a man? This Lebowski believes that a self-made "life of achievement" is the only path towards the ideal masculinity, and yet the wheelchair-bound, Korean War vet frets that the ideal masculinity has slipped from his grasp, as a close-up on his squinted eyes and pained

8

face suggests. His problem, however, is that he has never been in a position to "achieve" in the first place, as his daughter Maude later informs us. MAUDE: DUDE: MAUDE: The wealth was all Mother's. But your father he runs stuff, he-

We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it. But he'sHe helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance. He has no money of his own. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity.

DUDE: MAUDE:

Much like many men of his time, Lebowski has seen a drop in the number of opportunities to achieve. In lieu of such opportunities, Lebowski secretly feels he has failed as a man and compensates by hiding behind the appearance of achievement. The eoen brothers alternatively encourage their viewers to follow the Dude's lead and to reject the life of aggression, assertion, and achievement. This is a lesson that the Dude himself must learn and is what defines his character. In fact, at the film's outset, the Dude chooses the life of assertion after one of Treehorn's thugs urinates on the Dude's prized living room rug. Lacking a "sense of purpose" (like all wimps), the Dude must turn to his manly friend Walter for advice on the appropriate masculine response. Walter's advice is to amble to the elderly Lebowski's mansion and demand compensation for the soiled rug. Sitting before Lebowski, the Dude borrows Bush's macho sound byte, snarling, "This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man." Throughout the film, the Dude borrows the turns of phrases of other characters, which suggests that the Dude is trying to construct a masculine identity for himself by borrowing the character traits of manly men. Here, he is imitating Bush's "machismo"

9

and succumbing to the social pressure which requires men to assert themselves aggressively. Lebowski responds with his own macho rhetoric, ridiculing the Dude for being unemployed, for dressing casually, for being "a bum," and for "looking for a handout"in essence, for not aggressively asserting himself in the world. "Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski!" he shouts. "My advice is to do as your parents did get a job, sir! The

bums will always lose!" A few scenes later, when Lebowski asks the Dude to courier ransom money to the three nihilists, who have allegedly kidnapped Bunny, the Dude reluctantly agrees. But his decision to assert himself by helping out Lebowski only yields a slew of calamities. In fact, at the start of every scene, the Dude has allowed another characterusually Walter to persuade him into asserting himself, and by the end of nearly every

scene, the Dude has consequently suffered in one way or another: a thug socks him in the jaw; a kid steals his car taking the alleged ransom money with it; Lebowski learns

of the botched handoff, receives (what appears to be) Bunny's toe from the kidnappers, and threatens to kill the Dude; the three nihilists break into the Dude's apartment, smash his coffee table, and threaten to cut off the Dude's "Johnson" should he fail to recover the ransom money; a maniac takes a crowbar to the Dude's car; someone drugs the Dude; someone else throws a coffee mug at the Dude's forehead and then hoofs him in the stomach; and someone else torches the Dude's car. "I could be sitting here with pee stains on my rug," he tells Walter and Donny in the midst of his chaotic adventures. "My only hope now is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans [the nihilists] can cut my dick off." Self-assertion will ultimately

10

result in a man's own castration and in his failure as a man, the Coen brothers suggest. A man's best option is to stay in bed where it's safe and where no one will exploit

him. (It tums out that the elderly Lebowski withdrew the ransom money from one of his charities, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude an empty briefcase, knowing the Dude would screw up the handoff and would be shouldered with the disappearing money. Lebowski was hoping the kidnappers would kill Bunny, having realized that a trophy wife does not deliver the ideal masculinity he longs for; however, it is revealed at the end of the film that Bunny was not kidnapped but had actually gone on vacation.) In between his chaotic adventures, the Dude does find solace: e.g. in his bathtub smoking a jOint and listening to whale sounds or doing Tai Chi in his living room and drinking White Russians. He's happiest at home where he can further shield his mind from the strains of the outer world by sticking to "a strict drug regimen," as he terms it. He loathes competition and he takes no pleasure in fighting aggressors, which suggests that the Dude is not only a wimp, but is also a flaccid slug. For this reason, we do not see his final bowling match against Jesus Quintana nor do we ever get the sense that the Dude achieves any quantifiable success within the film. (Indeed, the Coen brothers are implicitly arguing that the Dude succeeds by not succeeding.) As Joel Coen tells

Indiewire, 'We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story -

how it moves episodically, and

deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery. As well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant" (Stone, 1998). Screenwriter William Goldman finds this frustrating: Another example of why the Coens drive me nuts: The Big Lebowski. This nutball melange of a flick takes place a lot of the time in a bowling alley, where John Goodman, who is nuts, is taunted by another bowler named Jesus (John Turturro). A toumament is mentioned several times.

11

And I know this: that is going to be some fucking bowling match. I don't know if either Goodman or Turturro is going to survive the thing, but I cannot wait. Guess what? Not only is there no bowling contest, the Coens never even thought of having one. For them, it was just background for character. Well guess what? - they're wrong, because I want to see Goodman kick Turturro's ass. (2000, 213) The Dude's anti-sociality irks Goldman, much as it irked several film critics (the film received mixed reviews) and the viewing public at large (the film fared poorly at the box office). But for a large mass of North American males those who attend the Big

Lebowski festivals, who trade Lebowski merchandise over e-Bay, who maintain Lebowski fan sites, who play Lebowski drinking games at college parties, and who
adore living vicariously through the Dude the Dude's anti-social sluggishness is a fine

way of coping with their aversion to demonstrating one's manhood through aggression, confrontation, and competition. It is for wimps, who see through the Dude that they should learn to enjoy the flaccid lifestyle for it would allow them to lead fulfilled lives without having to compromise their wimpiness. Indeed, the Dude seems to have adapted to the outer world by becoming the slug the wimp's evolutionary successor.

"Which One Was Logjammin'?"
The Coens also go to great length to demonstrate that the outer world is hypersexualized, which provides wimpy viewers, who lack a sense of "sexual purpose," with further reason for staying indoors. When the Dude first enters Maude's apartment, the Coens frame him in an extreme wide shot; appearing timid and relatively tiny, he tentatively steps inside a dark, cavernous, vaginal hallway. A woman's breathy moaning is audible. Through his POV, at the end of the hallway we see an artist's

12

canvas bearing the effigy of a woman's body. Seconds later, the Dude hears Maude's scream, her scream getting louder as she flies over his head. Suspended by a sling, she splatters paint on the Dude and on the canvas. The Dude's expressions of bewilderment at the hallway and canvas, and his full-out horrified shriek in reaction to Maude's ejaculatory body thrusting towards him, suggest the Dude is petrified of sexuality. As she puts on her robe, Maude elevates this subtext to the surface: MAUDE: DUDE: MAUDE: Does the female form make you uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski? Is that what that's a picture of? In a sense, yes. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.

The Dude is obviously made uncomfortable. With a stunned look, he replies, "Oh yeah?" Moments later, Maude shows the Dude a porn video, Logjammin', produced by Jackie Treehom and starring the teenaged Bunny and Uli Kunkel (Stormare), one of the nihilists. Four of the Dude's enemies, in fact, are portrayed as pedophiles. The elderly Lebowski is married to Bunny, a teenaged runaway from Minneso~lITe-ek!erIy /

L'

LehowskL Jackie Treehorn is having an affair with her. Jesus Quintana, Walter informs us, "did six months up at Chino for exposing himself to an eight-year-old. When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast." Quintana, UH, Lebowski, Jackie Treehorn - they are all the Dude's nemeses and are all overtly sexually active. The Coens are positioning the asexual (the Dude) above the sexual (his enemies), given that sexual assertion apparently leads to such heinous acts as child molestation.

13

In a later scene, Treehorn has summoned the Dude to his house to see if the Dude can assist him in finding Bunny or in recovering the money Bunny owes him. The Dude starts things off with, "How's the smut business, Jackie?" "I wouldn't know, Dude. I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy -" "Oh yeah, which one was LOgjammin'?" Again, the Coens position the asexual versus the sexual, with the asexual taking the moral high ground. Unlike Uli, Lebowski, and Treehorn men unable to ward off Bunny's sexuality

the Dude is. Their first encounter is beside Lebowski's swimming pool, where Bunny

is sun tanning in a string bikini while painting her toenails. Upon entering her space, the Dude is unable to engage in flirtatious talk, and it is Bunny who starts the discussion. BUNNY: DUDE: BUNNY: DUDE: BUNNY: Blow on them. Huh? Go ahead. Blow. You want me to blow on your, ah, toes? Uh-huh. I can't blow that far.

Holding her foot, the Dude is frozen and tries to avoid the issue. But Bunny shifts the conversation back to sexuality. ''I'll suck your cock for a thousand dollars," she says. Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the sexually repressed butler, explodes with laughter. "Ha ha ha ha hal Wonderful woman! We're all- we're all very fond of her. Very freespirited!" Ignoring Brandt, Bunny adds, "Brandt can't watch though. Or he has to pay a hundred." Positioned against the villainous Lebowski and Treehorn, who succumb to Bunny's sexuality, the Dude shuns it. And thus, the male viewer's wariness of our

14

sexualized culture is affirmed. Geared towards male viewers struggling to conform to the new model of masculinity, which requires men to workout in the gym, wear Calvin Klein underwear, and sport snug, colour-coordinated outfits, Lebowski provides the calming message, "Being afraid of sexuality is okay." Instead of wearing tight-fitting clothing, which signals sexual expressiveness, the Dude wears loose and tattered which clothes mask the contours of his body, his hair covers his face, and he often wears sunglasses. (In stark contrast, the villains Treehorn's thugs Quintana, Kunkel, Treehorn, and

wear tight clothing; in one scene, the contours of Quintana's

bulging penis are noticeably visible.) The Dude refuses to express himself sexually and his fear of sexuality is all over the film. His fear of homosexuality is established in the Dude's second visit to Maude's apartment, where an effeminate man named Knox Harrington (David Thewlis) sits cross-legged reading a magazine. His contribution to the film is limited to a couple of lines and a few squealing laughs, all of which irritate the Dude. DUDE: KNOX: DUDE: Who the fuck are you? Just a friend of Maudie's. Friend with a cleft asshole?

And in another scene, Walter screams over and over, "This is what happens, Larry, when you fuck a stranger in the ass!" when fifteen-year-old Larry Sellers (Jesse Flanagan) refuses to confess to having stolen the Dude's car. Being fucked up the ass, it is suggested, is the worst thing that can happen to a man. (Walter then turns on the heterosexual male's symbol of virility crowbar.) a shiny red Corvette and thrashes it with a

15

In the Coen brothers' films, sexual expressiveness is a symptom of moral corruption, with villains typically valuing sex as a source of pleasure and heroes valuing sex as a tool of reproduction. In a sense, the Coens are proponents of gender enslavement, requiring men and women to fulfill the traditional roles of family production and child rearing in our culture. In Fargo (1996), the kidnappers (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) are vilified because they act on their sexual drives there's a motel while

room scene where they're having blase, mechanical sex with two prostitutes -

the hero, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), is celebrated for cracking the case while carrying a child. In RaiSing Arizona (1987), the heroes (Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter) desperately want to have a child of their own, while Glen (Sam McMurray) gets knocked out by H.1. McDonnough (Cage) for suggesting they engage in "wife swapping." Although Barton Fink (John Turturro) is the hero of Barton Fink (1991), he is punished for seducing Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis), waking up the next morning shocked to find himself lying next to her impaled corpse. And when Maude shows the Dude the Logjammin'video, she snarls, "The story is ludicrous." Emphasizing its makeshift sets, amateur performances, and wooden dialogue, the Coens are clearly mocking the porn industry, suggesting that sexual activity is immoral unless other elements romance, love, and intentions to produce children story,

are present. "Yes, Mr. Lebowski,"

she adds, "these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word' (italics mine). Likewise in 0 Brother, Where Art Thou? (1999) and The Man Who Wasn't There

(2001), the protagonists learn to value sex solely for the sake of reproduction.

16

"You Mean Coitus?"
Although the Dude does learn the same lesson, he is conflicted, given that sexual expression is required for entry into manhood in our vanity culture. This tension is apparent when the Coens delve inside the Dude's psyche and present an erotic dream sequence a parody of Busby Berkeley musicals in which the Dude shakes his hips

to Kenny Rogers's "I Just Dropped In," caresses Maude's body, shows her how to bowl, and looks up dozens of women's skirts. All the while, the Dude is wearing Uli Kunkel's cable repairman outfit from Logjammin'. The Dude shuns sexuality, keeping it at a safe distance, but as we see in this and in other scenes, he does not completely repress it. As Maude's assistants help her off the sling, the viewer takes the Dude's POV, which frames Maude's naked body in an extreme wide shot. He looks at Maude, but keeps his distance, suggesting he is wary of, yet subconsciously intrigued by, her sexuality. In his second encounter with Bunny, the Dude has returned to Lebowski's mansion, where he spies Bunny prancing naked on the terrace, as the butler Brandt furiously picks up her clothes. Bunny is behind glass doors, so as to darken her nudity. And when the Dude watches the Logjammin' video, the video's blurriness divorces the image of a naked performer (played by real-life porn star Asia Carrera), from any deep, erotic attachment the audience, the Coens, or the Dude might associate with her sexuality.

Lebowski is filmed almost entirely in a wide-angle lens, which "exaggerates the
distance between the various objects in a frame, emphasizing their detachment from each other" (Robertson 1998, 82). Critics accuse the Coens of being "icy-hearted, with an emotionally sterile vision of the world" (81); however, that is precisely their point.

17

The Dude must flirt with sexuality embrace it -

in order to feel like a man -

but he cannot wilfully

because it so obviously troubles him.

In his three scenes with Maude, the Dude reluctantly allows her to force the issue of sex. MAUDE: DUDE: MAUDE: DUDE: MAUDE: DUDE: MAUDE: Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? Excuse me? Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it? I was talking about my rug. You're not interested in sex? You mean coitus? I like it too.

But if the Dude does like sex, he has an odd way of showing it. In their third meeting, the Dude stumbles through his front door, looks up and sees Maude standing over him. MAUDE: DUDE: MAUDE: Jeffrey. Maude? Love me.

Maude disrobes. DUDE: That's my robe.

The Dude is sexually attracted to Maude, as the Busby Berkeley dream sequence suggests. There, Maude stands before the Dude dressed in a sexually accentuating Valkyrie outfit, which the Dude softly caresses; however without a sense of sexual purpose, he's almost speechless when she disrobes. But the Dude then transcends his wimpiness and becomes the slug, allowing Maude to force herself upon him sexually.

18

In the process he becomes "a man," having proven himself on sexual grounds. Moreover, Maude's announcement that their romp in the sack was for the sake of having a child "What did you think this was all about, fun and games?" turns the

act into the ultimate demonstration of the Dude's manhood without having lowered the Dude into the "vulgarity" of sex for the sake of pleasure. MAUDE: Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact, I don't want the father to be anyone I have to see socially or would have any interest in raising the child himself.

Here, women are enslaved as the child carers whereas men are relieved of their responsibilities, given their wimpy refusals to assert themselves. Still, the Dude maintains a shred of a social role - that of sperm donor - which does not require the Dude to assert himself in any other way. Thus, the Dude can be a man without compromising his wimpiness. That the Dude cherishes sex for its own sake is a fact he keeps from himself and the Coens keep from the audience given their heightened fear of it. In his scene with

Jackie Treehorn, Treehorn receives a phone call, scribbles something on a pad, removes the top piece of paper, and exits. Curious, the Dude sprints up to the message pad, takes a pencil, and lightly runs over it, revealing what Treehorn had scribbled: a sketch of a man with an enormous erection. The film shows the Dude's flabbergasted expression, then returns to his POV: an extreme close-up of Treehorn's sketch, which looks as though it was drawn by a French Impressionist and is framed as though it were on an artist's canvas. But can a pornographer be an artist? Is sex valuable for its own sake not solely for the sake of reproduction? This is a powerful, visceral moment,

19

because it allows the Dude and the male audience to experience momentarily a man's sexuality as pleasurable in and of itself - without their conscious knowledge. By braving the tortures of the outer world, the Dude transcends his wimpiness. He bears the masochistic traits of the male protagonists of films noir whose masochism demonstrates an ability to endure physical and emotional abuse an ability required

for entry into manhood. In the "tough" investigative thrillers, especially The Big Sleep, the protagonist's indifference to torture leads to "the affirmation of the hero as an idealised and undivided figure of masculine potency and invulnerability ... " (Krutnik 93). Similarly, the Dude welcomes aggressive and sexual confrontation. True to his sluggish, wimpy self, he never fights back; however, nor does he ever run away. In a particular scene, the nihilists burst into the Dude's apartment, smash his telephone, and march into the bathroom. Most reasonable individuals would leap out of the bathtub, run for a phone, or hide "Hey, hey anything to save their skins. The Dude nonchalantly sings,

this is a private residence, man!" His pathetic attempt at avoiding

confrontation is not a sign of the Dude's laziness (regardless of the narrator's assertion that "the Dude was a lazy man"). In truth, it is a sign that the Dude subconsciously craves aggressive punishment and sexual humiliation into manhood. Ultimately, he wants to be punished both of which usher the Dude

and he is. "Nice marmot," he

sneers at the nihilists' pet rodent, which provokes the nihilists to toss the rodent into the Dude's bathtub. In Taking It Like a Man (1998), sociologist David Savran argues that contemporary men have experienced a paradigm shift and are under increaSing pressure to willingly endure pain, for it redeems them as "victims." The Dude likewise

20

enters manhood at the expense of masochism; however, he departs from Savran's paradigm of the contemporary male Savran invokes Sylvester Stallone's Rambo -

for the Dude is not portrayed as a victim and his mortality is never threatened. The Dude rather bears the scars of an assertive and competitive male, and is thus celebrated by his wimpy audience for having entered manhood without having shed his wimpy identity.

"The Dude Abides"
By placing himself in these situations, in which he suffers physical torture or sexual humiliation, the Dude sustains masculine stoicism and autonomy without having compromised his refusal to exert himself wilfully. The Coens present this strategy to a particular kind of man the wimp, a typology represented in several characters:

Brandt, Donny, Marty (Jack Kehler), and Da Fino (Jon Polito), all of whom shun aggression and sexuality, but who refuse to play the sluggish masochist. Like the Dude, they are wimps; unlike the Dude, they are not hard-boiled slugs, for they cannot present a front of indifference to the horrors of the outer world. Brandt's attempts at defusing Bunny's indecent proposals reflect an inability to hide his extreme embarrassment and an inability to sustain masculine stoicism. "That's marvellous," he exclaims before literally dragging the Dude away. Donny is terrified of confrontation. He runs in the other direction when the nihilists challenge him to a fight and when a maniac takes a crowbar to the Dude's car. This film is ultimately for individuals who want their identities accepted that of men who fear sex and self-assertion but who

nevertheless want the outer world to surprise them with sadism in order to feel like a

21

man. It's for men like Brandt, Donny, Marty, and Da Fino, all of whom revere the Dude, because they see in him a solution to their masculinity crisis. Donny clings to the Dude's side, Marty allows the Dude to pay the rent ten days late, Da Fino "Iove[s] his [detective] work," and Brandt consistently addresses the Dude with affection. The male wimp is a marginalized character in our culture, looked down upon for not being a "real man." Through the Dude, the Coens show all wimps how to become real men by

satisfying their urge to avoid social contact and by coolly succumbing to the occasional act of physical or sexual masochism. The Dude's final words to the narrator, and to us, are "the Dude abides," which suggest that he will remain idle, but will readily welcome the odd onslaught of sex and violence. The word "abide" was used in an earlier scene by the elderly Lebowski. "By God, sir," he says to Lebowski after receiving (what appears to be) Bunny's toe from Bunny's alleged kidnappers, "I will not abide another toe." Instead of borrowing Lebowski's identity, the Dude subverts it, and he finally settles on a comfortable social identity for himself one that is not based on anyone else, but one which actually

unifies his wimpy self with his social self. The narrator smiles, turns to the camera, and says, "The Dude abides. I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that." Sitting atop a barstool in a bowling alley the ultimate arena of sluggishness and idleness he

continues: "It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners. Shoosh." The narrator also takes comfort in knowing "there's a little Lebowski on the way" (the offspring of Maude and the Dude). With this sentiment, the Coens seem to be suggesting that idle masochism is not the greatest route towards the ideal masculinity,

22

but that for all us wimps, the hard-boiled slug is a temporary yet viable substitute for aggressive and sexual assertion. For now, by oscillating between states of idleness and masochism, the Dude feels like an autonomous and stoic being i.e. a man without compromising his

·

wimpy identity. Fans of Lebowski identify with the Dude's aversion to aggression and sexuality receiving the smug pleasure of watching the Dude negate filthy sexuality -

and they cheer when the Dude allows the world to force itself aggressively and sexually over him receiving the smutty pleasure of watching him get jumped passionately.

The Big Lebowski is, in essence, a mass-produced fantasy for wimps.

Appendix B Plot Outline of Billy Burkhalter, the Maltese Man
Act I. Billy Burkhalter, a hard-boiled wimp, lazes around at home one day when he receives a call from his employer Bertie, who invites Billy to his house. In his apartment's foyer, Billy meets a woman named Vivian who turns out to be the producer of 'Who's the Most Man?" a reality game show where Billy's brother

Warren works. Charmed by Billy, Vivian invites him to become a contestant. Billy refuses and leaves. When Billy arrives at Bertie's, Bertie asks Billy to retrieve for him King Henry VIII's Royal Jock Strap, one of the world's most treasured undergarments. He explains that in the mid-16th century, the king commissioned the jewel-encrusted jock strap which had been since believed lost to the ages until now. A young boy allegedly found the jock strap buried under

his gymnasium, exchanged it for drugs to a local mobster who then agreed to sell the jock strap to Bertie. Bertie, however, hired Billy's brother Warren and his cohorts to steal the jock strap, but when they did, they refused to hand it over to Bertie. So now, Bertie wants Billy to talk some sense into his brother. Billy agrees, but later that night, Warren gets shot by an unknown assailant, crawls to Billy's apartment, and dies in Billy's arms. As he's fading away, he gives Billy the Royal Jock Strap. Act II. Two weeks after Warren's murder, Billy is mourning at his brother's grave when Vivian approaches and re-invites him to become a contestant on "Who's the Most Man?" After agreeing to think it over, Billy goes home to find his apartment ransacked and the Royal Jock Strap miSSing. He calls Vivian,

knowing she can put him up so long as he's on the show. He immediately sets off for the studio out front of which he's accosted by a prostitute whom he

avoids before slipping inside. Vivian greets Billy and shows him to his room. Moments after Vivian leaves, Billy hears a knock on the door. He opens it, sees no one, and then turns back in where he sees the same prostitute lying on his

bed. She offers sex in exchange for the jock strap. When Billy faints, she searches him, finds nothing, and leaves. The next day, Billy has a competition against the office guy and wins by mocking the proceedings. He returns to his room at the studio, turns on the lights, and sees two uniformed officers and a detective, who claims to be a former 1950s TV star. The detective tells Billy that the mobster, Dirty Larry, had his goons kill Bertie and that they're coming after Billy next. The detective agrees to persuade Dirty Larry into believing that Billy doesn't have the jock strap, so long as Billy hands over the jock strap to the detective. Billy explains the jock strap's been stolen, and the cops leave. The next night, Billy has a competition against the gym guy and wins again by

mocking the proceedings. He returns to his room and this time he finds Dirty Larry's goons, who knock Billy out and throw him in a closet as they search Billy's room. While he's lying in the closet, Billy peers through a hole into an adjoining room and witnesses the execution of the office guy by two masked men. Petrified, he tries to untie himself, but only ends up making a ruckus, which summons Vivian to open the closet and rescue him. Later, as Billy is having a bath at Vivian's place, she seduces him - which doesn't frighten Billy as much as he expected it would. The next night, Billy faces off against the club guy and

ii

wins. At show's end, however, the power goes out and Billy is knocked unconscious; he comes to in the male typologies' underground lair. The typologies show Billy around, revealing a crystal methamphetamine laboratory to go with a roomful of drugged-up prostitutes enslaved in their prostitution ring. They invite Billy to join their team as "the slacker guy," and when Billy denies their request, they knock him out but not before threatening to kill Billy and

Vivian unless he gives them the Royal Jock Strap. Act III. Billy regains consciousness in the back of a taxi driven by the prostitute Peaches, who reveals herself to be the daughter of the infamous Dirty Larry. She tells Billy that she works for the male syndicate and stole the Royal Jock Strap for them, because she has a grudge against her Dad. The next night, right before showtime, Vivian happily tells Billy that the ratings are in and that

the show's in last place. Vivian explains that she took this job only because she hated the show so much and wanted to ruin it, which is why she hired Billy, knowing nobody but his loyal fanbase would watch the show. Billy then receives a phone call from his landlord, who explains that he took out Billy's laundry to be washed. Billy naturally assumes that the Royal Jock Strap went out with the laundry. As he's heading out to face off against the artist guy, Billy reads a note taped to his door from Peaches. She asks him to meet her after the show behind the alley, which he does soon as he dusts off the artist guy. But as he steps

into the alleyway, he's mugged by Dirty Larry's goons. Peaches, who has made up with her father, orders the goons to take Billy to Larry's car where Billy tells Larry that he'll find that jock strap at a local laundromat. But after fishing through

iii

Billy's laundry, Dirty Larry's goons find nothing. Feeling an itch on his legs, Billy fishes through his pants and unearths, 10 and behold, the static clinging Royal Jock Strap. Dirty Larry then boots Billy out of his car. The next night, Billy faces off against the funny guy and wins. He's then crowned "Most Man of 2004." After the show, a network exec fires Vivian for the show's abysmal ratings. Billy then watches a newscast, which explains that Dirty Larry, Peaches, and Dirty Larry's goons died in a car crash last night. And that the alleged Royal Jock Strap, which was uncovered in the collision, has been ruled a fake. Billy and Vivian retire from television and live happily ever after.

Hey, Simple question. How do I make all future instances of a particular button invisible once the user has clicked it? Thanks.

Posted by iaskwhy on 05-08-2004 01 :04 PM:

You have to give all the buttons instance names, then use a for loop to turn them off. Or, put them all inside a movie clip, then make the clip invisible when anyone of them is pressed.

Hey, In my flash movie, I have a button in scene 1 which, when pressed, tells the movie to jump from scene 1 to scene 2. Now, for the life of

me I can't figure out how to tell the button the following: Have movie clip B in scene 2 gotoAndStop at the frame number equal to the current frame of movie clip A in scene 1. Anyone know the actionscript?

Posted by jbum on 06-07-2004 03:30 AM:

,------------------------------

I'm assuming this is a problem because in scene 2, movieclip A is not longer present. In the button script (in scene 1) that goes to scene 2, store the current frame of the movieclip A in a global variable, just before you go to scene 2. _global.matchframe

= _root.movieclipa._currentframe;

gotoAndPlay("scene2"); / / or whatever you're using for this ... Then, on the frame you're going to in scene 2, have a script which sets movieclip B to that frame. _root. moviecli pb.gotoAndStopCglobal. matchframe );

BILLY BURKHALTER: THE MALTESE MAN By Sean Springer ACT ONE FADE IN:
1

INT. MYSTERIOUS ROOM -- DAY In the distant centre of a dark room sits a neon blue bean bag chair. Slouching within is the flaccid, almost lifeless body of a rudderless, middle-aged man. This is BILLY BURKHALTER. Illuminated by a spotlight and accompanied by soft, brooding jazz, he converses with a figure offscreen. SOOTHING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Take us back to the beginning, Billy. BILLY Well, I got lost in a maze one day that sucked. (beat) Uh, my brother died. He was shot with a staple gun. As he was dying, he gave me this jock strap, which I kinda misplaced. Then, uh, I became a contestant on a reality TV show. Don't remember much of that, though. Later, some guys beat me up. These other guys drugged me. I did meet a really fine romantic partner -- named Vivian. A hooker -- someone else entirely -- was peripherally involved. Come to think of it, I was asked to invest in a prostitution ring. It went belly up, though. (beat) Uh ... SOOTHING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) I understand, Billy. It must hurt -remembering. BILLY No, man. I had a killer time. Any memory loss is brought on by head wounds and excessive self-medication. SOOTHING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Might your adventure have started here? Right inside your own apartment? The background lights up, revealing an aesthetically uninspired decor of brown, chipped walls, a bookshelf piled

CONTINUED: with old 35s and philosophy texts, and a poster of Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Marx, and actor Jeff Bridges. Looking as sparkling and radiant as ever, the obsequious DIANE SAWYER -- her head resting on her fist -- presses Billy. She's flanked by cameras, camera operators, a lighting director, and a producer. DIANE SAWYER Let's return to Sunday, May 18th. The day tragedy struck the Burkhalter clan. BILLY Well ... you're the interviewer. I'm the interviewee -- so let's see ... FADE TO BLACK FADE IN:

INT. BILLY'S ROOM -- MORNING This frame's composition is identical to the composition of his bedroom, with two exceptions: Billy is asleep and snoring loudly -- and the game's interface has emerged into view. At the screen's bottom are a series of commands, which THE PLAYER can click before clicking objects in Billy's environment or in his inventory. The inventory is to the right of the commands. Across the screen's top are Billy's stress and self-esteem metres. The stress metre is divided into ten sections, the first six being CALM, the next three being ANXIOUS, and the last being DELIRIOUS. The self-esteem metre is also divided into ten sections, the first six being POISED, the next three being TIMID, and the last being WIMPY. His self-esteem and stress metres are both at nine. BILLY (V. 0 . ) The morning was pretty ordinary. My self-esteem was steady, but my stress level was edging towards delirium. So, I took measures to reduce it to a state of serenity without killing my poise. FYI, Diane: When my stress level is calm and my self-esteem level is poised, I'm ready to face the world. But when I'm feelin' anxious or timid, I'm on house arrest until I'm relaxed. And if I ever get delirious or wimpy -- it's game over for me. DIANE SAWYER (V.O.) What stresses you out?

3. The Maltese Man. By Sean Springer. FIRST DRAFT.

CONTINUED: BILLY (V.O.) Sex -- on account of my Catholic upbringing. Violence -- on account of being abused by my brother, Warren. But, really, anything that requires energetic self-assertion stresses me out. (beat) Fortunately, I find solace in drugs, booze, classic rock, and social avoidance. DIANE SAWYER (V.O.) How do you boost self-esteem? BILLY (V.O.) Trying to succeed in my professional and personal life. Being assertive. Withstanding the lashings of a brutal world. DIANE SAWYER Must be tough balancing your stress level with your self-esteem level. BILLY (V.O.) You've hit the snail on the shell. SFX: ALARM CLOCK BUZZER. BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Okay, I'm sure the first thing I did was turn off my alarm clock. In order to turn it off, the player must click the verb TURN OFF and then the object ALARM CLOCK. IF the player does not do this within ten seconds, THEN Billy adds: BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Yo, lazy bones: Click TURN OFF and then click ALARM CLOCK. Once Billy turns off the alarm clock, he says: BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Okay, uh ... the rest is kinda hazy. I know I explored my pad, finding ways to chill myself out. NOTE: IF the player's stress and self-esteem metres are not above and below their operative levels and IF the player clicks OPEN and the EXIT DOOR, THEN Billy pipes in: BILLY (V.O.) Two things. (MORE) (CONT'D)

IF the player clicks LOOK and BOOKSHELF, THEN Billy rises and walks towards the bookshelf, which comes into full view, with three titles to choose from: Muscle & Fitness magazine, Marx's Capital, and Handy Dandy Zen Quotes. IF the player clicks READ and then the MUSCLE & FITNESS magazine, THEN Billy picks it up and flips through it, revealing images of beautiful, bulging men. BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D) What the fuck is this doing here? Billy's stress metre rises by one point. His self-esteem metre falls by one point. (1,-1) [Note: from now on, changes to Billy's metres will be shown in brackets. For example, (1,-2) means his stress metre has risen by one point and his self-esteem metre has fallen by two points.] IF the player chooses to read Capital, THEN Billy picks up the book and leafs through it, quoting at random: BILLY (CONT'D) "The possessor of money does find such a special commodity on the market: the capacity for labour. In other words, labour power." (flips a page) "Centralization of the means of production and socialization of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument." BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Nice knowing I won't be exploited for much longer. The only question is, when will my people be liberated?

IF the player chooses to read Handy Dandy Zen Quotes, THEN Billy picks up the book and leafs through it, quoting at random: BILLY (CONT'D) "To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders." Lao Tzu. (flips a page) "Do not consciously seek enlightenment." Muso Kokushi.

IF the player selects The News Channel, THEN the television airs a brief news report: ANCHOR In Toronto, a precious artifact of the British Royal Family was recently uncovered by an area high school student. Historians had thought King Henry the Eighth's Royal Jock Strap had been lost to the ages, but were proven wrong when Kevin Breamer found the artifact buried under the school gymnasium. Shortly after the discovery was made, however, the jock strap allegedly disappeared from Mr. Breamer's locker. Police have no leads at this time. (beat) Turning to the world of sports ... (The channel is turned off) BILLY (V.O.) Watching the news is SO exhausting.
(1,1)

IF the player selects The Business Channel, THEN the television airs an advertisement, showing several businessmen climbing ladders. ANNOUNCER (V.

Billy is now standing behind the bar, which is equipped with various bottles of liquor vodka, rum, gin, tequila, kahlua and glasses. A fridge is to Billy's right. IF the player clicks POUR and then any bottle of liquor, THEN Billy will pour a drink into a glass. IF the player clicks DRINK and then the glass, Billy will throw it back and grimace. BILLY (V.O.)

A large, refreshing pitcher of Sangria. IF the player chooses to have Billy pour the sangria into a glass and drink it (as before), Billy will lick his lips and grin. BILLY (V.O.)

Tell you the truth, Diane, she was just like every other person lid seen sitting in a foyer. Only difference was, she was reading a book. (beat) I took the seat across from her, as I waited for Warren to show his face.

INT. BERTIE'S BILLIARDS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS Billy stumbles into Bertie's billiards room -- and flops in front of Bertie, who's sitting uncomfortably in a throne, his hands tied behind his back. Bertie is a pudgy, balding, middle-aged man, with a devilish and intense glare in his eyes. He talks slowly and monotonically, but with enough vocal tension to suggest a temper tantrum is imminent. A pool table lies in the center of the room and is surrounded by various games: a chess board, a dart board, a card table. As Billy finally lifts himself to his feet, Bertie blows cigar smoke into his face. Billy hacks for a few seconds, then finds a seat at the chess table. BERTIE ( struggling) Pardon me, William. Let's see ... It's tug, twirl, and thump. Bertie triumphantly breaks free of the rope. BERTIE (CONT'D) Tug, twirl, and thump. It's the technique Japanese POWs used to free themselves from American twine. So. How was the maze?

BILLY Enemies, like those two goons I threw up allover? BERTIE Precisely -- and nice touch. BILLY And what do they want, man? BERTIE To teach me a lesson on etiquette. I hired some friends of your brother's to steal a precious commodity from their boss, Dirty Larry. D.L. found out and was, uh, perturbed. BILLY Precious commodity ... BERTIE The Royal Jock Strap. First worn by King Henry the Eighth, circa sixteenthirty-eight. It was stored in a private collection until a few weeks ago -- when a chap gave it to Dirty Larry for some coke. (hands Billy a book) Read all about it -- and other historical undergarments -- in A HISTORY OF UNDERWEAR. Yeah, okay. BILLY So why tell me, man?

As the credits role, a female network exec walks over to Vivian. NETWORK EXEC Viv -- the show's been a complete disgrace. Burkhalter here's so fucking boring he's scared off our core demographic. The only reason why this scumbag won is because the audience is his entire fanbase -non-consumers not within our key demographics. The show's cancelled clear out your office. Detective Street and his uniformed thugs walk onto the set. Along with the other three male typologies. NETWORK EXEC (CONT'D) (turns to male syndicate) That means no more protection for the four of you. Detective Street here's got some questions about a prostitution ring. As Billy and Vivian watch Detective Street and his uniformed thugs round up the male syndicate, their attention is distracted by a news report on one of the monitors. ON TV ANCHOR The alleged Royal Strap Jock was recovered earlier today, when a limousine slipped on ice and plowed into a strong and sturdy tree. Four occupants were killed instantly. The only survivor was the driver, who attributed the crash to his inability to take his eyes off the undergarment. As for the authenticity of the jock strap, archaeologist Roy Steeles examined it and concluded that the relic is a fake. The band read, "Calvin Klein," for one. And for two, he added, British historians confirmed long ago that Queen Mary -or Bloody Mary, as she was branded -sold off the jock strap's precious jewelry. She then defecated on the actual jock strap and burned it. DETECTIVE Ohhhhh, shit. (MORE)
