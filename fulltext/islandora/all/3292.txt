Abstract STUDIES IN SIMULTANEOUS GENERATION OF CENTRAL AND AXIAL CHIRALITY VIA THE BUCHWALD-HARTWIG REACTION by Robert Anthony Denning Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2014 The Buchwald-Hartwig reaction has been investigated previously by the Viirre group to show that intramolecular cyclization using palladium and (R)-(+)-2-(diphenylphosphino)-2-methoxy1,1-binaphthyl, can instill enantioselectivity. This system was continued to show that steric bulk on the 2' position on the phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen malonamide can lock the rotation ending in a chiral axis. The diastereomers resulting from this chiral axis can be selectively formed when the substrate is 2-(2-bromobenzyl)-N1,N3-bis(2-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-2methylmalonamide and using a similar ligand (R)-dicyclohexyl(2'-methoxy-[1,1'-binaphthalen]2-yl)phosphane with enantio- and diastereoselectivities of 88% and 99% respectively. The work presented in this thesis continues on this class of substrates to include N,1-Di([1,1'-biphenyl]-2yl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-3-carboxamide, as well as a newer class of monoamide substrates. The monoamide substrates allowed the interpretation of events occurring in the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction, ultimately showing that the chiral center on the substrate has some control as to the outcome of the chiral axis. Lastly, a timed sampling kinetics experiment was done to investigate if the enantiomers of the starting material were being consumed at different rates or if one diastereomeric product was being produced favourably. The kinetics experiment shows that the system does not have a preference as to the starting material or product being produced.

1 1.1

Introduction Stereochemistry Stereochemistry is an area of chemistry devoted to understanding the differences between

molecules which have the same atoms and bonds but differ in their three-dimensional structures. Isomers that differ in this way are known as stereoisomers.1 This thesis deals with issues of stereochemistry and will therefore begin with a brief introduction into the matter. 1.1.1 Chirality Chirality is a property of certain organic molecules that arises from not being superimposable on their mirror image, as seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1 - Mirror Images of 2-Fluorobutane

1.1.1.1

Point Chirality Point chirality exists when having four different groups bonded to a central tetrahedral

carbon atom.1 As in Figure 1, the carbon atom bonded to F, H, ethyl and methyl is at the center of the chirality. This is known as the chiral center.1 1.1.1.2 Axial Chirality When the chiral element is not on a single atom, but along a bond between two atoms, this is known as axial chirality.2 Generally, bonds are allowed to rotate freely, but when this

1

rotation is restricted by steric hindrance or  bonds, this creates an element of chirality, as in Figure 2.

Figure 2 ­ Axial Chirality Due to Restricted Rotation Both Sterically and by  Bonds

1.1.2

Enantiomers Refering back to Figure 1, the two molecules differ only in the arrangement of the

substituents bonded on the chiral center. These give rise to the nonsuperimposable mirror images as seen. The pair that is represented in this figure are known as enantiomers.1 Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in achiral environments. Enantiomers behave differently in chiral environments, i.e. chiral reactions and biological activities, and can be separated by chiral means, i.e. chiral salts, chiral HPLC, etc. 1.1.3 Diastereomers Molecules that have n chiral centers or elements typically have 2n different stereoisomers. For instance, the four possible arrangements in a molecule that has two chiral centers or elements are, RR, SS, SR, RS. When both chiral elements are switched to the opposite configuration, those molecules are enantiomers. This means, RR is the enantiomer of SS, and SR is the enantiomer of RS. A diastereomer is when at least one chiral element is different, while at least one is the same.1 For instance, in this case SR and RS are diastereomers of RR and SS. This is depicted by the stereoisomers of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in Figure 3. 2

Figure 3 ­ The Four Configurations in Molecules with Two Chiral Centers

1.1.4

Stereoselectivity Reactions that have achiral reagents and produce a chiral product always produce equal

amounts of R and S. This is known as a racemic mixture. When one or more reagents or catalyst, used in a reaction is chiral, then there can be a preference for one enantiomer over another, as depicted in the reaction given in Figure 4.3

Figure 4 ­ Enantioselective Palladium Catalyzed Arylation

3

Stereoselectivity is measured in enantiomeric excess or %ee. The enantiomeric excess is calculated by the difference of the enantiomers divided by the sum of the enantiomers. The ee for the reaction in Figure 4 is 90% ee.

Figure 5 ­ Enantiomeric Excess Equation

An enantiomeric excess of 100% would mean only one of the enantiomers was produced, or enantiopure. An enantiomeric excess of 0% would be equal parts of each enantiomer, or racemic. 1.2 Buchwald ­ Hartwig Cross-coupling Reactions In the early 1990's, Buchwald4 and Hartwig5,6 started working on palladium catalyzed nitrogen arylation. The overall reaction is seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6 - General Buchwald-Hartwig Reaction

The mechanism originally proposed by both Buchwald and Hartwig had a step to make tin amides which would enter into the catalytic cycle, but this was found to be unnecessary as the palladium is able to coordinate the secondary amine without the tin treatment. However, it was found that certain cases might require tin amide formation to increase yields (as seen in Scheme 1.)6

4

Scheme 1 - Original Mechanism Of the Buchwald-Hartwig Using Tin Amides

The reaction mechanism, as seen in Scheme 2, works with either monodentate or bidentate ligands forming 3- or 4-coordinate palladium complexes, respectively. If the palladium source used is Pd(II) it then must be reduced to a Pd(0) complex before it can enter into the catalytic cycle. There are several ways in which it can be reduced within the reaction mixture. The first example of reduction is beta-hydride elimination of the amine species present.7 The palladium species can also be reduced by the phosphine ligand, in which case the phosphine is oxidized to a phosphine oxide, with the assistance of water.8 The next step in the cycle is the oxidative addition of the aryl halide to the palladium forming a 3 or 4 coordinate complex. Then the amine coordinates to the palladium, followed by deprotonation of the amine and release of the palladium bound halide as a salt.6 The final step is the reductive elimination of the substrate forming the C-N bond and regeneration of the Pd(0) catalyst. There is also a potential side

5

reaction that can happen at this stage where reductive elimination does not occur but betahydride elimination occurs, forming the debrominated arene product, and an imine.

Scheme 2 - Buchwald-Hartwig Cross-Coupling Mechanism

1.3

Preservation of Enantiopurity In 1997, Wagaw et al. had shown that coupling an optically active amine with an aryl

halide can be done without the racemization of the product (Figure 7.)9 This discovery is critical to the pharmaceutical industry, as optically pure drugs have proven to be generally more active than their racemic counterparts.10

Figure 7 - Preservation of Optical Purity after Amination

1.4

Regioselective Buchwald-Hartwig Amination Differentiation of similar amine groups with the use of the Buchwald-Hartwig amination

reaction can be done with (i) the use of a chiral ligand, or (ii) by taking advantage of halide reactivity in the reaction. Uzarewicz-Baig et al. demonstrated that camphor diamines can be selectively arylated at the primary amine attached to a 2o carbon as opposed to primary amine attached to a 3o carbon in the presence of Pd2(dba)3 and racemic BINAP, as seen in Figure 8. Yields range from moderate to excellent and can tolerate many different types of arenes.11 This is selective due to the ligand in the catalyst, (±) BINAP. The steric bulk of the ligand selectively arylated the less bulky nitrogen.

Figure 8 - Regioselective Arylation with BINAP

7

Another example of regioselective Buchwald-Hartwig reaction involves differentiation at the oxidative addition step. It was observed that, given a choice for the palladium to react with either a napthyl bromide or a napthyl iodide, the iodide was chosen with good to excellent yields (70-95%). The ligand used is the achiral Xantphos with palladium acetate and cesium carbonate, as seen in Figure 9.12

Figure 9 - Regioselective Amination by Aryl Halide Selectivity

1.5

Enantioselective Amination Since the Buchwald-Hartwig amination is the formation or an aryl-nitrogen bond, it is

generally not thought to be able to have enantioselective properties. The only cases to date have been either when the amination is selecting a single enantiomer to react with, thus derivatizing only one enantiomer and thus making them separable, or when the substrate has a plane of symmetry that is being broken by the amination usually through regioselection.

1.5.1

Chiral Resolution Researchers at Merck were able to selectively resolve 4,12-dibromo-[2.2]-

paracyclophane with the use of Pd2(dba)3 and (S)-PHANEPHOS, Figure 10. The reaction takes place more favourably (about 3 to 4 times more) on the S enantiomer of the substrate. The reaction produces a complex mixture of compounds but leaves the R enantiomer of the starting material in a 93% ee. It is interesting to point out that this resolution discriminates at the aryl halide oxidative addition stage of the mechanism.

Figure 10 - Kinetic Resolution Via Buchwald-Hartwig Amination

1.5.2

Asymmetric Amination In the case of desymmetrization of a molecule by amination, the selectivity is given

preference to a single enantiomer, also with the use of chiral ligands. Porosa and Viirre, had shown in 2009, that with a substituted malonamide substrate, they were able to produce optically active quinolinone moieties in excellent yields and good enantiomeric selectivities, Figure 11.13

9

Figure 11 - Desymmetrization of Malonamides with (R)-MOP

Following on this asymmetric amination, Sasai et al. have designed a similar malonamide substrate, but in this case they have made the central prochiral carbon doubly substituted with bromobenzyl groups in which case both amides was arylated (Figure 12).13,14 They use the same catalyst loading but with (S)-BINAP which is similar to (R)-MOP in structure. They also achieve similar yields and enantioselectivites as Porosa and Viirre.

10

1.5.3

Enantioselective Formation of a Chiral Axis Another form of enantioselectivity that can be brought on by the Buchwald-Hartwig

amidation is with the formation of a chiral axis. Generally C-N single bonds can freely rotate and it is rare that there is a chiral axis formed by this reaction due to nitrogen's ability to invert. Taguchi et al. in 2005 presented a reaction in which the amine was attached to a 2-(tbutyl)phenyl group, thus post arylation the t-butyl group sterically locked free rotation forming a chiral axis as shown in Figure 13.15

Figure 13 - Generation of a Chiral Axis by Arylation

The group extended this concept to intramolecular reactions (Figure 14) and were able to drive the reaction to excellent yields and enantioselectivities, 95% and 96%, respectively. In this case they have switched to using (S)-BINAP and a weak base Cs2CO3. The reaction also takes a considerable amount of time longer than previous trials.

11

Figure 14 - Intramolecular Amidation Forming a Chiral Axis 1.6 Biphenyl Based Ligands Over the years since the Buchwald-Hartwig amination was first reported, there have been efforts devoted to making better more robust or selective ligands. Modifications have shown drastic changes to the scope of the reaction. Originally the ligands were simple monophosphine biphenyl compounds with bulky alkyl groups on the phosphine, DavePhos and JohnPhos, depicted in Figure 15. Larger, bulky groups were attached onto this scaffold to create greater reactivity and diversity among the Buchwald-Hartwig reactions. The robustness of these catalyst systems are have improved as well, catalyst loadings are seen as low as 0.05 mol% and are still able to drive reactions to near completion. A select few examples of the ligands employed are depicted in Figure 15. All of these ligands pictured are achiral.16

12

Figure 15 - Several Achiral Ligands for Buchwald-Hartwig Amination

1.6.1

Binaphthyl Base Ligands

The binaphthyl ring system unlike the biaryl ring system, has an extra benefit of being chiral. The phosphine is still bound to the bulky dialkyl/biaryl groups as this aspect aids in both the oxidative addition and the reductive elimination steps.16 Generally without substituents the rings can freely rotate about the C-C bridge, but when a substituted phosphorus, nitrogen or oxygen is attached at the 2 and 2' position, that rotation is locked, forming a chiral axis.17,18 The most notable binaphthyl phosphine ligands are (R)-BINAP and (R)-MOP.19

13

Figure 16 - Common Binapthyl Phosphine Ligands

Oxidation of the phosphorus has been thought to deactivate the ligand rendering it incapable of coordinating to the palladium. In cases like BINAP where there are two phosphorus atoms, if one atom is oxidized to P=O the oxygen has been shown to coordinate the palladium along with the pre-existing P(III) atom, as seen in Figure 17.20

Figure 17 - (S)-BINAPO Complex with Palladium

Most modifications to the MOP-type ligands have been at the 2,2' position on the binaphthyl scaffold, since the commercially available BINOL has two alcohol groups for facile derivatization. Generally the modifications are other bulky alkyl groups to increase the selectivity. Zhang et al. created several ligands, through an 8 step synthesis, containing bulky alkyl group such as; Cy, t-Bu, Me, iPr and Bn, to investigate simple amination. Interestingly, they found one of their ligands was particularly effective for monoarytlation of primary amines as depicted in Figure 18.21

1.7

Research Goals The objective of this thesis is to extend the previous work of desymmetrization of

malonamides reported by the Viirre group to include bulky otho-substituted phenyl substituents on the malonamide nitrogen atoms. This class of substrates possess both a prochiral centre and axis, with the possibility of setting both selectively in a single Buchwald-Hartwig event, as seen in Scheme 3.13

15

Scheme 3 - Previous Work Published by the Viirre Group

Previous work in the Viirre group completed by Augusto Matarazzo, preliminarily reported that (R)-dicyclohexyl(2'-methoxy-[1,1'-binaphthalen]-2-yl)phosphane, which will henceforth be referred to as (R)-Cy2MOP, was more effective ligand for this transformation then phenyl substituted MOP used in earlier desymmetrizations. Matarazzo had completed the cyclization of the 2-t-butylphenyl malonamide compound, the sample that was sent for crystallographic data was not enantiopure, meaning the absolute configuration observed cannot be linked to the major peak in the HPLC as there is a chance that it was compound producing the minor peak in the HPLC.22 This is where the thesis will begin. Also, as the ligand is not commercially available, a secondary goal of the project was to develop a practical method for the synthesis of (R)Cy2MOP.

16

2 2.1

Results and Discussion Synthesis Towards Substituted Malonamides To determine the absolute configuration of the cyclized product 8 that was previously

carried out by Matarazzo,22 the substrate 6 needed to be prepared. Although the original synthesis was carried out using diethyl methylmalonate, starting with diethyl malonate would allow for further customizability of the alkyl group at the alpha carbon.

Scheme 4 - Synthesis of Diethyl 2-(2-Bromobenzyl)malonate from Diethyl Malonate The first step from 1 to 2 is a substitution step in which a 2-bromobenzyl group is added to diethyl malonate. Sodium hydride was used since it deprotonates the central carbon irreversibly. The reaction proceeded smoothly and the resulting diethyl 2-bromobenzylmalonate was obtained in a good yield. The following methylation step converting 2 into 3 proved to be challenging. The reaction did not go to completion and would require column chromatography to separate the starting material from the product. The problem was that under the solvent systems; hexanes/EtOAc, hexanes/Et2O, EtOAc/Et2O, neat DCM, DCM/hexanes, and CHCl3, a good enough separation was not attainable for chromatography. The difference in polarity imparted by the addition of only a methyl group on this already non-polar compound was not large enough to separate 2 from 3. Other forms of separation were not options either. For instance, the starting 17

material and the product are both oils at room temperature and thus cannot be purified by crystallization. The next reaction is a hydrolysis reaction and the reactivity of the esters on the starting material and the product are comparable, leading to a more complex mixture of compounds. Thus, starting material of this reaction could not have been carried over and then separated at a later step. After several attempts at trying to purify this compound or drive the reaction to completion, was prepared using the original synthesis as reported by Matarazzo. The synthesis that was carried out previously uses diethyl methylmalonate 4 as a starting material in order to obtain compound 3, as seen in Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 - Synthesis of Diethyl 2-(2-Bromobenzyl)-2-methylmalonate from Diethyl 2Methylmalonate

Scheme 4 would have allowed for customizability of the alkyl position at the alpha carbon. This could have led to the investigation of the electronic and steric properties that position has on the cyclization of the malonamide end product. Unfortunately due to the separation issues, the starting material was switched to 4 for the ease of synthesis as seen in Scheme 5. The substitution reaction in Scheme 5 to produce 3 in 89% yield uses NaH in THF. The next reaction in the synthesis of 8 was the saponification of 3 affording the substituted malonic acid 5, as seen in Scheme 6. 18

Scheme 6 - Hydrolysis of Diethyl 2-(2-bromobenzyl)-2-methylmalonate Both reaction and workup conditions needed to be carefully controlled in order to obtain good yield. During early attempts, the reaction was heated to reflux overnight in accordance to similar syntheses, but this high temperature and caustic conditions led to decarboxylation of the product. The workup includes an initial extraction with Et2O while the aqueous phase remains basic to recover any starting material that had not reacted. This is followed by protonation of the carboxylic acid groups with 1 M HCl, which produces 5 and is no longer soluble in the water/EtOH mixture. The product 5 was believed to be soluble in DCM/CHCl3, and so this was chosen as an extraction solvent. Visibly the precipitate had disappeared. Upon concentration under vacuum, there was nothing left in the flask. Since after concentrating the Et2O phase only produced trace amounts of unreacted 3, the original thought was that compound 5 was undergoing decarboxylation during the concentration step of the workup, but there was no evidence of by product. Replicating this reaction, proved to yield the same result, of an absence of anything in any flask. The successful attempt at the isolation of 5 was due to filtering out the precipitate after acidification and realizing the compound is not soluble in DCM but EtOAc instead. Switching

19

the extraction solvents was able to isolate 5 in a 91.5% yield. This reaction is 100% based on recovered starting material.

Scheme 7 - Malonamide Formation from Malonic Acid

The formations of different malonamides were done under identical reaction conditions, as shown in Scheme 7. The malonic acid was taken up in thionyl chloride and heated to 60 oC for four hours to convert to the acid chloride. It is difficult to monitor this reaction by TLC because the thionyl chloride creates large dark spots on the silica plate. The acid chloride was not isolated because it can decompose easily back to the starting material 5, after prolonged exposure to moisture. After the four hours at elevated temperature, the product was worked up and carried through. The reaction was evaporated under vacuum to remove extra thionyl chloride, redissolved in chloroform and further concentrated several times to remove any traces of thionyl chloride. After this brief work up there was still a slight thionyl chloride smell that was apparent but further evaporation did not dissipate the smell. The acid chloride was dissolved in DCM (0.1 M), and the desired amine (2-t-butyl aniline or 2-biphenylamine) was added slowly over ice. The reaction was warmed to room temperature and allowed to stir for an hour before being cooled again and having the base added. The reaction was heated to reflux overnight and the work up consisted of an acid extraction to remove extra amine and base. The yields are generally poor to moderate for this reaction with the best yields being 30% and 49% for the bis(t-butylphenyl) 20

malonamide and bis(biphenyl) malonamide, respectively. The poor yields could be due to the low nucleophilicity of anilines. Also the amines that are used are sterically hindered by the bulky ortho substituents. With the difficulty these bulky amines have forming the amide, it is statistically challenging to form an acid chloride and subsequent nucleophilic displacement twice on the same molecule. For example, if the amide formation proceeds with a moderate yield of 65%, then having this happen twice on the same molecule the yields are multiplicative resulting in an overall yield of 42%. 2.2 Cyclization of Substituted Malonamides As in the amide formation, each malonamide was cyclized via the Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross-coupling using SPHOS (achiral) or Cy2MOP (chiral) as the ligand. The general procedure for the reaction, as seen in Scheme 8, was adding the malonamide, palladium source and ligand to a Schlenk flask while evacuating and back filling with nitrogen in between each addition. Ensuring the nitrogen backfilling in between each addition seemed to be the best route to exclude oxygen from the reaction mixture. Previous work in the lab had added all the solids and then evacuated and backfilled three times in a row lead to irreproducible results. Better reproducibility was found when all solids excluding the base were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (0.1 M) and heated to 100 oC to obtain a clear solution. This generally happened within 20-30 seconds but the reaction was given three minutes to ensure complete solvation. Upon cooling to room temperature, the base was added and the reaction was sealed for 48 hours at 100 oC, under N2. During the 48 hours, some of the reactions turned black and some did not. This black precipitate is the palladium catalyst becoming inactive and precipitating. This was not an indication of completion as some reactions would have the reaction go to completion before the catalyst decomposed and some would not. Moderate to great yields were observed, with the better yields 21

stemming from the t-butyl substituted compounds. This could be due to the inherent steric bulk causing issues in allowing the coupling of the palladium to the nitrogen and aromatic group at the same time while still being bound to the bulky ligand. The difference in yields among the substrates could be due to differences in which each bulky substituent interacts with the catalyst, electronic differences of the two amides (i.e. pKa or nucleophilicity) or by agostic interactions that result from the t-butyl C-H bond interacting with the palladium atom's empty d orbital, assisting in the coordination of the amine. The sp2 nature of the C-H bond present in the biphenylamine is less nucleophilic and thus has a lower yield. Further study into the interaction of these types of substrates with the catalyst is underway in the Viirre group.

Scheme 8 ­ General Reaction for the Cyclization of Malonamides 2.2.1 Analyzing Enantioselectivity and Diastereoselectivity of Cyclized Substituted Malonamides There are two ways in which diastereoselectivity is calculated, by NMR and HPLC. Enantioselectivity can only be analyzed by HPLC, since enantiomers are magnetically equivalent. The way that the diastereomeric ratio is calculated by 1H NMR is observing the ratio

22

and splitting pattern of the benzylic CH2 peaks. In the starting materials 6 and 7 the protons are equivalent and produce a singlet for two protons, as seen in Figure 19.

Figure 19 - CH2 Singlet Peak of 6

When the cyclization reaction forming the chiral products 8 and 9, the two protons are no longer magnetically equivalent, they are diastereotopic. The two protons couple to each other, forming two doublets leaning towards each other, and integrate for one proton each. Since diastereomers are not magnetically equivalent, each set of diastereomers give rise to a pair of leaning doublets that are well resolved in the 1H NMR spectrum. The diastereomeric ratio is calculated by dividing the integration of one pair of doublets by the integration of the combined 4 doublets. The four doublets can be observed easily in the 1H NMR spectrum of 9 when cyclized with the Pd/SPHOS catalyst system, Figure 20.

23

Figure 20 - Diastereotopic Protons of 9 via Pd/SPHOS

Using the protons in Figure 20 as an example, the integration all of the doublets total 2.91. It is clear which protons are on the same diastereomer as the doublets are paired in integration and amount of leaning towards one another. Totaling the integration of the two major diastereomeric protons is 2.02, and dividing by the total integration yields a diastereomeric ratio of 70%. The diastereoselectivity of 9 when cyclized with Pd/SPHOS can be compared to the cyclization of 9 when cyclized with Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP as in Figure 21.

24

Figure 21 - Diastereotopic Protons of 9 via Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP

The 1H NMR spectra of 8 when cyclized with Pd/SPHOS (Figure 22) and Pd/(R)Cy2MOP (Figure 23) show only one set of doublets meaning that there is only one diastereomer formed in the reaction. This was later confirmed by HPLC.

Figure 22 - Single Diastereomer of 8 via Pd/SPHOS

25

There is an impurity peak seen at 3.48, but it is quite evident that there is only one set of doublets meaning that there is only one diastereomer produced in this reaction. A comparable spectrum is seen in Figure 23, when the Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP catalyst system was used.

Figure 23 - Single Diastereomer of 8 via Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP

The diastereomeric ratio and enantiomeric excess of the compounds 8 and 9 can be calculated by HPLC. Using a Chiralpak OD-H column, each of the four diastereomers are separated and integrated based on the area of each peak. To understand which two peaks correlate to a set of diastereomers, the product formed from the Pd/SPHOS reaction analyzed by HPLC first. Since the SPHOS is achiral, there cannot be any enantioselectivity, resulting in two pairs of peaks that can be seen to have the same areas, as seen in Figure 24.

26

Figure 24 - HPLC Chromatogram of 9 via Pd/SPHOS

With the identification of the diastereomers as seen in the Figure 24, analysis of the HPLC chromatogram of 9 as cyclized by Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP shows enantioselectivity. In Figure 25, the peak area in increasing order is 2072.2, 6148.2, 14744.9, 6627.4, which totaled is 29592.7 The diastereomeric ratio as per the HPLC is 72% which differs from the results seen in the 1H NMR spectra. The enantiomeric excess is 38% and 49.5% for the major and minor diastereomers, respectively.

27

Figure 25 - HPLC Chromatogram of 9 via Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP

The HPLC chromatograms of 8 are not as well resolved but there is only one diastereomer that is seen. There is a contaminant of starting material seen but it does not interfere with the analysis, the Pd/SPHOS reaction forming 8 is shown in Figure 26.

28

Figure 26 - Product 8 via Pd/SPHOS Once again, with the identification of the enantiomeric peaks established, the chromatogram of the reaction forming product 8 with Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP can be done, shown in Figure 27. With the NMR and HPLC data, the reaction forming product 8 with Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP, is 100% diastereoselective and 90% enantioselective. This means that out of four possible conformations, one is being highly selected for.

29

Figure 27 - HPLC Chromatogram of 8 via Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP The two compounds 8 and 9 were cyclized with SPHOS and (R)-Cy2MOP as the ligand. Since SPHOS is achiral the reaction won't exhibit enantioselectivity but the reaction is able to show diastereoselectivity. The results for the four reactions are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 - Enatioselectivity and Diastereoselectivity of the Cyclization of 6 and 7 by SPHOS and (R)-Cy2MOP

From Table 1, it is clear to see that the enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity are favoured in the cyclization reaction that forms 8. Although there is a slight enantioselectivity seen in the SPHOS reaction forming 8, this is within the margin of error for the instrument; as only the chiral ligand, (R)-Cy2MOP, can result in enantioselectivity. In both reactions forming 8 involving SPHOS and (R)-Cy2MOP, the diastereoselectivity is preserved, which is reflected in the NMR and HPLC results. The diastereoselectivity then could be caused by either the ligand, in the catalyst system or it can be potentially directed by the substrate. The overall cyclization reaction to form 9 shows poorer enantio- and diastereoselectivity when using Pd/SPHOS and Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP. The reaction using (R)-Cy2MOP does show greater diastereoselectivity, as by NMR (Figure 21) but when viewing the HPLC chromatogram (Figure 25) there seems to be the same amount of selectivity for one diastereomer as seen with the 31

Pd/SPHOS system. Also there is only moderate selectivity seen in the (R)-Cy2MOP reaction at 36% and 50% ee for the major and minor diastereomers respectively. The different bulky R substituent, phenyl (9) as opposed to t-butyl (8), is impacting the cyclization negatively. For reasons stated earlier, the nature of the biphenyl substrate produces poorer reactivities and selectivities. 2.3 Synthesis Towards Monoamide Compounds Further investigation into the mechanics of this cycle needed to be done, thus the next system looked at were the monoamide compounds 11-13, as seen in Figure 28.

Figure 28 - Monoamide Compounds Used to Understand Enantio- and Diastereoselectivity within the Buchwald-Hartwig Reaction

Since these compounds only have one potentially reactive amide functional group and begin the reaction mixture as a racemic mixture, they offer the possibility of determining whether it is the substrate or the catalyst that influences axial chirality. Starting from 3 the first step was a monohydrolysis of the malonate, Scheme 12. This proved to be very difficult since both esters have the same reactivity and reaction temperatures required for the hydrolysis to occur were high, which would encourage both esters to hydrolyze. Failed attempts include; room temperature for seven days, 0.5 M NaOH and 0.25 M KOH, slight heating at 40 oC, different

32

solvent systems (THF, EtOH, EtOH/water, MeOH/water), phase transfer catalysts (tetrabutylamonimum hydroxide), which all either resulted in no reaction or dihydrolysis. Once MeOH was used instead of EtOH, but this only resulted in transesterification and the dimethyl malonate 20, was recovered in 62% yield, Scheme 9 .

Scheme 9 - Transesterification of Diethyl Malonate to Dimethyl Malonate

Mono methylation of the diacid 5 was also attempted with methyl iodide or dimethyl sulphate in a phosphate buffer but the reactions either did not work or formed the dimethyl ester 20, Scheme 10.

Scheme 10 - Monomethylation Attempts on Substituted Malonic Acid

33

With a sizable amount of the dimethyl malonate 20, it was considered for future derivatization. Monohydrolysis reactions were attempted and proved to be successful by solubilizing the base as well as the substrate separately, followed by a slow addition of the base solution to the substrate solution over ice. A quick one hour reflux with a subsequent acid workup afforded the monoacid compound 21 in 32% yield, Scheme 11. Compound 21 was carried through to both the 2-(t-butyl)phenylamide and 2-biphenylamide. The issue with this route was that there was not enough material to continue through, considering diethyl 2methylmalonate was the original starting material. Also it was different from our other models, so this route was not pursued further.

Scheme 11 - Monohydrolysis of Substituted Dimethyl Malonate

34

The reaction conditions that were used for the monohydrolysis of the derivatized dimethyl malonate, were used to achieve a monohydrolysis of the diethyl malonate, as seen in Scheme 12.

Scheme 12 - Monohydrolysis of Diethyl 2-(2-bromobenzyl)-2-methylmalonate

The large fluctuation in yield for the reaction is likely due to greater difficulty in achieving very slow addition of the NaOH on smaller scales, thus smaller attempts ended up in poorer yields. Mechanical addition with a motorized syringe would make this addition simpler in the future. With a reliable method to produce the monohydrolyzed product on hand, the next step was to make the 2-(t-butyl)phenylamide and 2-biphenylamide analogs. The same conditions that were used for the conversion of the malonic acids, 6 and 7, to the malonamides, 8 and 9, were used for the mono acid mono ester conversion, as seen in Scheme 13.

Scheme 13 - Conversion of Mono Acid to Mono Amide

35

The reactions forming monoamides, 11-13, were still plagued by the problems that occurred in the formation of compounds 8 and 9. There is still the use of aniline compounds which have lower nucleophilicity and the formation of the acid chloride is difficult to monitor by TLC. The yields of the reactions forming 11-13, are higher than reactions that form 8 and 9, could be attributed to the fact that only one acid chloride and subsequent nucleophilic attack needs to occur and thus poor yields are not amplified. Also in the reaction to form the malonamide compounds, 8 and 9, the second amine attack might be impeded sterically after the first amide is formed. 2.4 Cyclization of Substituted Mono Amide Compounds The final step would be to cyclize compounds, 11-13, with catalyst systems including SPHOS and (R)-Cy2MOP. The cyclization reactions were conducted in the same manner as the malonamide compounds. Each reaction was run for 48 hours, except compound 13. Since 13 has no bulky substituent on the ortho position of the phenyl ring, a chiral axis is not possible and thus the reaction can only lead to two enantiomeric products. The idea was that if the reaction was stopped early enough, prior to completion there may be some selectivity either for one enantiomer. The general reaction is represented in Scheme 14.

36

Scheme 14 - Cyclization of Monoamide Compounds

The reaction forming 15 produced the lowest yield of all monoamide compounds 14-16 which was analogous to cyclized malonamide reactions forming 9. Both products 9 and 15 have the 2biphenylamide substituent which again is poorer in reactivity and selectivity for reasons stated earlier. The compound 16 does not have a comparable malonamide to be measured against but it is interesting to note that without any bulky ortho substituent, the reaction does not go to completion whereas the reaction to form 14 does. Similar to compound 8, the 2-tbutylphenylamide substituted 14 goes to completion showing that the catalyst system is complimented very well by the ortho t-butyl group. 2.4.1 Analyzing Enantioselectivity and Diastereoselectivity of Cyclized Monoamide Compounds The enantio- and diastereoselectivity of the cyclized monoamide compounds 14-16 were analyzed in the same manner as the malonamide compounds 8 and 9. The 1H NMR of compound 11 when cyclized with the Pd/SPHOS catalyst system shows poor diastereoselective control compared to previous malonamide reactions, as seen in Figure 29. 37

Figure 29 - Diastereotopic Protons of 14 via Pd/SPHOS

The same reaction forming product 14 with the Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP catalyst produced just as good of diastereomer control as the Pd/SPHOS containing reaction, as seen in Figure 30. Throughout this project the diastereomeric ratio is the same for the reactions involving the same substrate but differ in catalyst makeup. This means that the diastereomeric ratio is more dependent on the substrate than on the catalyst.

38

Figure 30 - Diastereotopic Protons for 14 via Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP

There is an improvement when comparing the diastereomeric ratio of product 14 to that of product 15. The diastereomeric ratio is 75:25 for 12 when cyclized with either Pd/SPHOS, as seen in Figure 31. Once again, it might be due to the substrate and how it interacts with the catalysts to produce the diastereomer. Future research into precatalyst systems could shed light on the interactions of the catalyst and the substrate.

39

Figure 31 - Diastereotopic Protons for 15 via Pd/SPHOS

Diastereomeric enrichment seen in Figure 31, is reproduced when compound 15 is synthesized by the Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP catalyst, as in Figure 13.

40

Figure 32 - Similar Diastereoselectivity Seen Producing 15 via Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP Since the substrate 13 does not have the potential to form and not a chiral axis, there are no diastereomers that are present and thus only a single set of doublets are produced in the 1H NMR of both the Pd/SPHOS and Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP reactions, as seen in Figure 33.

Figure 33 - Cyclization Forming 16 Only Produces Enantiomers

41

Analysis of the cyclized monoamide compounds 14-16 with HPLC has proven to be difficult. HPLC conditions in order to separate all four diastereomers of 14 have been found. But conditions to successfully separate all four diastereomers of 15 and enantiomers of 16 have not yet been discovered. Once again, the product 14 cyclized by Pd/SPHOS allows the identification of the diastereomeric peaks in the chromatogram, as seen in Figure 34.

Figure 34 - HPLC Chromatogram of 14 via Pd/SPHOS

It is evident that the first two peaks represent the major diastereomer and the last two peaks represent the minor diastereomer. Using this information the analysis of the reaction forming 15

42

with Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP can be done to calculate both the diastereomeric ratio and enantiomeric excess, the HPLC chromatogram is seen in Figure 35.

Figure 35 - HPLC Chromatogram forming Product 14 via Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP

As stated earlier, the HPLC conditions to fully resolve the four diastereomers of 15 could not be found. However, the diastereomeric ratio can be calculated since the diastereomers are separated, shown in Figure 36.

43

Figure 36 - Unresolved Chromatogram of 15 via Pd/SPHOS

This monoamide reaction scheme was pursued to show the potential substrate directing effects on the overall diastereomeric and enantiomeric selectivity of the reaction. Unfortunately, to date, HPLC conditions to resolve enantiomers of 16 have not been found. Also there seems to be some inconsistent results creating non-comparable chromatograms for compound 15 cyclized by Pd/(R)-Cy2MOP. The results for the dr (by NMR and HPLC) and er (by HPLC) are shown in Table 2.

Table 2 - Enatioselectivity and Diastereoselectivity of the Cyclization of 14, 15 and 16 by SPHOS and (R)-Cy2MOP Comparing Table 2 with Table 1 with respect to the dr of the compounds, previously it was the compound with the t-butyl substituent 8 that had complete diastereoselectivity, but in the case with mono amide compounds the diastereoselectivity for the biphenyl compound 15 has held constant but is now much higher than the t-butyl compound 14. It is also evident by the HPLC that there is degradation in the enantioselectivity of the compounds as well. This would give the impression that either the steric nature of the distant amide is directing the enantioselectivity or impacting the catalyst in a way that helps it form one enantiomer. 2.4.2 Kinetics Experiment of the Cyclization Reaction of 11 with (R)-Cy2MOP and (R)BINAP The kinetics of the cyclization reaction of 11 was studied to investigate if there was a preference towards consuming a single enantiomer of 11 or producing a single diastereomer/enantiomer of 14. HPLC conditions were optimized so the peaks for the starting material did not overlap with the peaks for the product. Figure 37 shows an example chromatogram a mixture of 11 and 14. 45

Figure 37 - Optimized HPLC Conditions to Identify 11 and 14 The reaction was done according to the condition in Scheme 14, with samples of the reaction being taken at time intervals; 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr. The drops were then diluted in 1 mL of 10% IPA/Hexanes and analyzed by HPLC. At the time of the experiments the absorption coefficients of all compounds in the reaction were not known. Thus quantification of the drop was not done, which could have led to the determination of the amounts of each compound present. Since the drop was not quantified, percent areas are shown in Table 3 to understand the amount of consumption/production as the reaction progresses. This reaction was not monitored by NMR since the enantiomers of the starting material, 11, and the two sets of enantiomers of the product, 14, cannot be seen since they are magnetically equivalent.

Table 3 - Reaction Kinetics of the Cyclization of 14 with (R)-Cy2MOP The first two peaks mentioned (8.973 min and 9.782 min) are the enantiomers of the starting material 11, where the last 4 peaks (10.361, 11.660, 14.818 and 22.122 min) are the four diastereomers of the product. Over the course of 48 hours each enantiomer of 11 is consumed at roughly the same rate. Looking at the (±) 14 major diastereomer peaks, there is an initial selectivity seen at the 45 min mark, but there is only a small amount of major enantiomer present. The major enantiomer has an overall percentage of 31.2 percent at 48 hours, giving a 36.5% ee. With the (±) 14 minor peaks, the last peak takes a while before it is seen in the HPLC,

47

two hours after the reaction has started. The ee for the (±) 14 minor peaks, which is 39.6% ee, is similar to the (±) 14 major peaks. The kinetics experiment was also repeated with (R)-BINAP and (R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS but by HPLC analysis no reaction had occurred. 2.5 Synthesis of (R)-Cy2MOP The ligand of choice for our studies, (R)-Cy2MOP, is not commercially available. The source of the chirality comes from the starting material, (R)-BINOL. The BINOL is methylated as in Scheme 15.

Scheme 15 - Methylation and Triflation of (R)-BINOL

This reaction was a difficult one to make the desired product, as a lot of dimethylated byproduct can be created. The extremely slow addition of the iodomethane with high stirring helped this reaction achieve the good yield observed. The following reaction to form 18 also proceeded with good yields. Previous attempts required stirring overnight to achieve good results, but the slow addition of the triflic anhydride and maintaining a concentrated solution allowed this reaction to consume all of the starting

48

material in two hours. With a usable amount of (R)-18 on hand a large scale reaction was done to prepare the active ligand (R)-Cy2MOP. The reaction conditions to make (R)-Cy2MOP are similar to that of the BuchwaldHartwig cross-coupling reaction studied in this thesis. The Buchwald-Hartwig reaction involves an aryl-halide and an amine, whereas the reaction to produce (R)-Cy2MOP involves the aryltriflate and a phosphine, both reactions use a phosphorus bound palladium catalyst. The reaction is shown in Scheme 16.

Scheme 16 - Synthesis of (R)-Cy2MOP from (R)-Me-BINOL-Otf The range in yield can be attributed to the switch to the Pd(-cinnamyl) chloride from the palladium acetate. The largest scale this reaction was ran at was 1.16 mmol with a yield of 350 mg (63%) there was more than enough to carry out the remainder of the cyclization experiments. The (R)-Cy2MOP was compared by HPLC against the racemic Cy2MOP that was kindly prepared by Ms. Nande Wright following the same procedure outlined here but starting with racemic BINOL. When the (±)-Cy2MOP was analyzed by HPLC, there are two peaks observed, at retention times 17.065 and 19.374 min. Allowing the analysis of the enantiopurity of the (R)Cy2MOP, which only has one peak at 19.186 min, ensuring a R enantiopure conformer. 49

Conclusion With the use of (R)-dicyclohexyl(2'-methoxy-[1,1'-binaphthalen]-2-yl)phosphane, (R)-

Cy2MOP in the Buchwald-Hartwig, excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivity of substituted malonamides can be seen (up to 90% and 100%, respectively). The selectivity seen is attributed to the effect of the steric bulk on the ligand playing a key role. This system was expanded to the substrate N1,N3-di([1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl)-2-(2-bromobenzyl)-2-methylmalonamide but lower selectivity was observed in this case. To investigate the mechanism further, monoamide malonamide compounds were synthesized. Cyclization of the monoamide compounds would determine if the (R)-Cy2MOP ligand or the substrate's chiral center is influencing the stereochemistry of the chiral axis. Once the cyclization reactions were done, there was a lot of loss in enantio- and diastereoselectivies as this could be due to the lack of steric bulk further away from the catalytic site. HPLC analysis of the molecules proved to be difficult, and only ethyl 1-(2-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-3-carboxylate was fully resolved. Finally, the synthesis of (R)-Cy2MOP was done in a three step process, compared to the 8 step process as seen in the literature. Successful characterization and HPLC analysis showed that the chirality of the molecule was retained completely throughout the synthesis. Future work should isolate the precatalyst systems of the catalyst with these groups of substrates to better understand the interaction occurring. The kinetics reaction of cyclized malonamide compounds needs to be done to fully understand the selectivities that have been seen, or develop models that better reflect the initial findings of Matarazzo.
