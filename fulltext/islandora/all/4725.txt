Objective: This systematic literature review aims to identify diabetes self-management education (DSME) features to improve diabetes education for Black African/Caribbean and Hispanic/Latin American women with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: We conducted a literature search in six health databases for randomized controlled trials and comparative studies. Success rates of intervention features were calculated based on effectiveness in improving glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c), anthropometrics, physical activity, or diet outcomes. Calculations of rate differences assessed whether an intervention feature positively or negatively affected an outcome. Results: From 13 studies included in our analysis, we identified 38 intervention features in relation to their success with an outcome. Five intervention features had positive rate differences across at least three outcomes: hospital-based interventions, group interventions, the use of situational problemsolving, frequent sessions, and incorporating dietitians as interventionists. Six intervention features had high positive rate differences (i.e. !50%) on specific outcomes. Conclusion: Different DSME intervention features may influence broad and specific self-management outcomes for women of African/Caribbean and Hispanic/Latin ethnicity. Practical implications: With the emphasis on patient-centered care, patients and care providers can consider options based on DSME intervention features for its broad and specific impact on outcomes to potentially make programming more effective. ß 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction The North American prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) reached 10.2% in 2010, and is estimated to reach 12.1% by 2030. This is an increase of 42.4% in the number of adults who will have diabetes [1]. There is a growing ethnic disparity in the prevalence of diabetes and its related complications. In the United States, the 2004/06 national survey data indicated that the prevalence of diabetes was greater in non-Hispanic Blacks (11.8%) and Hispanics (10.4%) compared to non-Hispanic whites (6.6%) [2]. In Ontario, the most populated province in Canada, the Black population has higher rates of diabetes (11.6%) than the White population (7.3%) [3]. Furthermore, recent immigrants from Latin America and the

Caribbean (9.8%) have the second highest prevalence rates of diabetes compared with long-term residents and recent Western Europe and North America immigrants (5.2%) in Ontario [4]. Overall, North America has a growing ethnic population at an elevated risk of developing diabetes. In addition to high prevalence rates, persons of Hispanic/Latin and African/Caribbean backgrounds in North America are at higher risk for poor glycemic control and diabetes-related complications. Non-Hispanic Blacks with diabetes have poorer glycemic control, higher blood pressure, and a higher risk of diabetes complications compared with non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans [5]. For instance, Latin Americans and African Americans tend to have substantially higher mean glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels than Caucasians [6], and accordingly are at a higher risk of complications such as coronary heart disease [6], retinopathy [7], end-stage renal disease [7,8] and death [6,8]. Although certain ethnic minorities are vulnerable to developing diabetes and related complications, the risks appear to be higher in women than men. African/Caribbean and Hispanic/Latin American

immigrant women in Ontario have higher rates of diabetes compared with men from the same country [4]. Research shows that women living with diabetes may be at higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) [9,10] than men, and that mortality from both coronary heart disease [11,12] and stroke [13] is greater in women than men with diabetes. The prevalence of mental illness such as depression and anxiety disorders is also greater in women compared to men living with diabetes [14,15]. The impact of these disorders adversely affects self-care behaviours, glycemic control, quality of life, and diabetes complications [14­17]. The greater risk of complications in women compared to men may be due to differences in how women experience and manage their diabetes. While it is well established that diabetes self-management education (DSME), a complex health intervention, is generally effective at enhancing self-care behaviors [18­21], improving glycemic control [22], lowering health care costs [23], and improving quality of life [18,20], the specific impact of DSME features on outcomes have not been thoroughly evaluated [24] particularly for specific cultural and gendered populations. For instance, research shows that women have different self-management education needs compared with men. Latin American women are said to be better suited to and more successful with interventions that incorporate family, peers, and promotoras (i.e., community health workers) for social support [25]. South Asian women find it harder than men to discuss their problems with male physicians or to participate in mixed-gender education groups [26]. These findings suggest that men and women with diabetes may have different DSME needs and that different cultures may respond better to various DSME intervention features than others. A better understanding of which intervention features are associated with improved outcomes by gender and culture can be used to target interventions to specific populations to enhance learning, skills building, and diabetes management more effectively than a standardized DSME program. Given the rising prevalence of diabetes among women from certain ethnic backgrounds and women's greater risk of diabetes complications compared with men, the goal of our study was to systematically review the literature to identify DSME features associated with various self-management outcomes. For women of African/Caribbean or Hispanic/Latin ethnicity living in industrialized countries. The impetus for our research was to help direct the development of a new government-funded DSME program at a community health center specifically tailored for women from high-risk ethnic groups for diabetes. The results from this study are intended to help diabetes educators and health practitioners learn how best to deliver DSME to achieve the desired self-management outcomes. 2. Methods 2.1. Search strategy Key words used to search for relevant articles included: adult, Type 2 DM, patient care management, patient education, patientcentered care, ethnic groups, and competency-based education. A library technician searched for relevant articles published in English from 1980 to 2008 in Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, HealthStar, PsycInfo, and ProQuest Nursing & Alliance Health. Using women as a key search term was not recommended due to the high probably of excluding studies that sampled primarily women. Thus, the search strategy was broad (sensitive) to include as many relevant articles through subsequent manual screening. Reference lists of relevant reviews and articles and tables of contents from Diabetes Care and Diabetes Educator were thoroughly reviewed to ensure all relevant studies were

obtained. Lastly, researchers in the field were contacted to identify relevant gray literature; however, no new resources were identified. 2.2. Inclusion criteria Studies were limited to randomized controlled trials and comparative studies. Primary studies that provided outcomes of DSME interventions initially for three ethnic groups (i.e., African/ Caribbean, Hispanic/Latin and South Asian women) in industrialized countries were reviewed. Articles had to focus on participants diagnosed with Type 2 DM who were over 18 years of age. Given the few numbers of diabetes self-management interventions conducted exclusively with Black African/Caribbean and Hispanic/Latin American women with Type 2 DM, we included studies that had a sample of a minimum of 70% women (representing the majority of the samples) or reported analyses by sex. Studies were excluded if the articles were not peerreviewed and did not provide enough information about the type of program to analyze the intervention's features. Lastly, we excluded articles that focused solely on groups of subjects with a specific co-morbidity (e.g., those only with heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, etc.), and reports of intervention feasibility. We were also unable to find studies for South Asian women (as stipulated in the inclusion and exclusion criteria) and thus unable to include this population of women in the review. Fig. 1 shows the selection process of this review.

2.3. Data extraction Abstracts were independently screened by two of the authors (L.M. and V.C.) to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. After the authors (L.M. and V.C.) retrieved eligible articles, each author was responsible for extracting half of the articles. A data extraction form was adapted from the literature [27,28] for this purpose. Following data extraction, the two authors exchanged articles, read them, and reviewed the corresponding data extraction sheet performed by the other person to ensure data extraction accuracy. There were few discrepancies between the two reviewers in the extracted data that were resolved in consensus discussion with the lead author (E.G.). This review examined the following intervention features of DSME: (i) intervention setting, (ii) intervention format, (iii) mode of delivery, (iv) education strategies, (v) duration-length of intervention, (vi) intensity-frequency of session, (vii) type of interventionist, (viii) content delivered to the participants, and (ix) intervention design (Table 2). 2.4. Validity assessment Quality assessment [29,30] was conducted by two of the authors (L.M. and V.C.) to review the clarity of the study aims, the adequacy of details about the sample, the rating of the study design, the clarity of the methodology, and the reliability and validity of the measures and tools. Scores were allocated based on the presence of potential bias in these components as reported in the articles. The accumulated score was divided by the number of components in the scoring for the quality of the studies. A study with a final score of 75% or more was considered ``good quality'', between 51 and 74% ``fair'', and a 50% or less ``poor''. 2.5. Data analysis Due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and measured outcomes, we could not conduct a meta-analysis. We therefore used a recently described method to identify specific intervention features likely to be associated successfully or unsuccessfully with the outcome of interest [31]. Interventions were analyzed based on their success in producing a significant change (p-value 0.05) in outcomes, in the hypothesized direction [31]. Outcome measures of interest were HbA1c levels, anthropometrics, physical activity, and diet outcomes. Studies that reported at least one of the four outcomes were included in the analysis. These four outcomes were selected based on what most studies investigated, although instruments measuring these outcomes varied across studies. For instance, anthropometrics consisted of various measures including body mass index, thigh skinfold, body weight, tricep skinfold, waist-to-hip ratio, total body fat, percent body fat, trunk fat, and fat-free mass. Diet was assessed with a desirable change in any of the following: total kilocalorie intake, dietary risk score, mean vegetable consumption, fruit consumption, consumption of five fruits and vegetables per day, fried food consumption, healthy eating plan adherence, fat-related dietary habits, dietary fat intake, dietary cholesterol intake, kilocalories from saturated fat, and percent kilocalories from fat. When a study used several instruments to measure an outcome (e.g., diet), at least 60% (an arbitrary cut-off) of the measures must have reported significant positive results to be considered a success for that outcome. Only post-test outcome data were used for all analysis. A rate difference determines which intervention feature has a positive or negative association with an outcome [31]. A rate difference was estimated for each intervention feature identified in the review using the following steps. First, a success rate was

calculated for both the intervention with and without the feature. The success rate for the intervention feature (SRWF) is the number of studies reporting on the intervention having the feature of interest associated with a positive participant outcome, divided by all the studies reporting on intervention with the feature regardless of outcome; the specific formula used was: number of studies with feature with positive outcome/all studies with feature. Second, a success rate without a feature (SRWoF) is the number of studies reporting on the intervention without the feature of interest with a positive participant outcome, divided by all the studies without the feature regardless of outcome; the formula was: number of studies without feature with positive outcome/all studies without the feature. Third, rate differences were calculated for each intervention feature, by subtracting the success rate with feature (SRWF) from the success rate without the feature (SRWoF). The higher a positive rate difference the more likely that feature has a successful association on the outcome. As an example, the following explains how the rate difference of 66.67% for the intervention feature related to setting of intervention delivery (i.e., home-based) on diet outcomes was calculated in Table 2. Three out of six studies reported an intervention with a home-based setting and three studies did not. Two out of three studies indicated a positive effect of the intervention with the feature on diet outcome and none of the three studies without the feature found a positive effect on diet outcome; accordingly, the rate difference was: SRWF À SRWoF = (2/3) À (0/3) = 66.67%. Since this number is positive, the results suggest that the feature of home-based setting had a positive association with diet outcomes. The higher a positive rate difference the more likely that feature has a successful association on the outcome. 3. Results 3.1. Description of studies Thirteen studies were analyzed. Study characteristics can be found in Table 1. Ten articles [19,32­40] were randomized controlled trials; the remaining three [41­43] were cohort studies including both an intervention group and a comparison group. Eight studies included African/Caribbean American [19,32,33, 36,38,41­43] participants. Three studies [37,39,40] included mixed cultural groups composed mainly of African American and some Caucasian participants. Two of the studies had Hispanic/ Latin American participants [34,35]. Five articles had exclusively women participants [38­40,42,43]. One study had sex-stratified results (but the sample was also comprised of more than 70% women [35]). The remaining studies had at least 70% women participants [19,32­34,36,37,41]. With regards to quality, only one article received a rating of ``Fair'' [43], all other articles were rated as ``Good'' (see Table 1). Because only 13 studies met our inclusion criteria, we were unable to stratify our analysis by ethnic group as originally planned. 3.2. Analysis of features Table 2 displays the intervention features that have positive success rate differences for HbA1c, anthropometrics, physical activity, and diet outcomes. 3.3. HbA1c levels Ten studies reported on HbA1c levels [19,32­34,36,38­42]; three of these studies [32,36,39] indicated positive effects. A total of 37 intervention features were included in this analysis, of which 18 were associated with a positive success rate difference (see Table 2).

4. Discussion and conclusion 4.1. Discussion DSME programs are complex interventions with various content and delivery components necessary for the education and skills building required for diabetes self-management. However, limited efforts have been made to investigate which intervention features are associated with a positive outcome, specifically for women of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Studies mainly concentrated on glycemic control (i.e., HbA1c levels) (10 studies) or anthropometric outcomes (11 studies), as opposed to behavioral outcomes such as diet (5 studies) and physical activity (5 studies). Since behavioral outcomes strongly reflect the lifestyle changes needed to achieve the desirable metabolic outcomes [18,44], it is imperative to understand how intervention features affect these intermediary outcomes as well. Only five (of 38) intervention features had positive success rate differences for at least three of the outcomes examined in this review: hospital-based intervention setting; group intervention format; situational problem-solving; high intensity (10 or more intervention sessions); and incorporating dietitians as interventionists. Because of their broad influence, we recommend the features that demonstrate success across multiple outcomes in DSME programming for the populations of interest. Many of these features are also recommended in DSME programming for the general population by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA). Specifically, group programming and situational problem-solving are recommended by both national organizations [45,45], as these features are shown to be effective in improving HbA1c outcomes [46]. Furthermore, the CDA recommends nutritional counseling of clients with diabetes by a dietitian, either one-on-one or in small group settings, to lower HbA1c levels [45]. A recent study supports this recommendation; it found that visits by a dietitian are associated with lower hospitalization rates and charges in persons of varied cultural backgrounds compared to diabetes classes and one-on-one visits from non-dietitian health professionals [47]. Our analysis suggests that incorporating dietitians has positive success rate differences on anthropometrics, and physical activity, in addition to HbA1c.

We are unsure why hospital-based interventions appear more successful across outcomes. However, hospital-based settings are more likely to have high-intensity sessions, in our review, which was found to be more successful on HbA1c, anthropometric, and physical activity. There is some evidence to suggest that high-intensity interventions or greater patient-provider contact hours is an important DSME feature that positively affects glycemic control [31,44]. Also, hospital-based interventions (eight studies) have been studied more than community (three studies) or home (four studies) based interventions. As the current trend in North America is to move DSME into community settings, understanding how this feature affects certain outcomes is imperative. Tailoring DSME is suggested to improve diabetes-related outcomes [46]. Providing evidence on intervention features that have a high rate difference for the specific outcome of interest can facilitate tailoring (see Table 2). To illustrate, incorporating peer workers as interventionists and using the telephone as a means of delivering education had a positive rate difference of 50% for physical activity. Community peer workers are reported to be important interventionists for women in ethnic minorities, as they often provide social support and act as a liaison between the participants and health care professionals [48,49]. The use of telephone for improving physical activity is supported by a metaanalysis that reported delivery of diabetes self-management coaching via telephone had a positive effect on exercise [45]. Phone contact is convenient, simple and inexpensive; it may also be useful in reaching individuals who have barriers traveling to programs. Interventions that have psychosocial content (e.g., discuss quality of life with participants, and include empowerment or motivational interviewing) had a positive rate difference of 80% with diet outcomes. The relationship between diet and psychosocial issues is particularly relevant for women from high-risk ethnic groups living with DM. Interventions that focus on psychosocial support and self-management have proved successful in some studies among Hispanic populations because they address emotions and beliefs about diabetes and deal with the question of how adjusting one's lifestyle may conflict with cultural norms [50]. Another study suggests that African American women have difficulty complying with diet because of poor psychosocial adjustment and denial of the severity of the disease [51] and thus, DSME programming that incorporates psychosocial coping strategies may be effective in improving dietary behaviors. Using diaries and providing feedback to participants both have over 50% positive rate differences for HbA1c outcomes in our findings. Providing feedback and using diaries or logs may be useful in improving HbA1c because they are tools that may allow interventionists and patients to discuss barriers and find solutions to overcome self-management challenges. In a randomized trial, a graphical representation of HbA1c level for patients and physicians to use as a log and point of feedback for every visit has been found to decrease HbA1c levels in inner-city patients compared to those who did not use the logs [52]. This feature may be effective because it facilitates communication and overcomes some language, culture and literacy barriers due to its graphic nature [52]. As mentioned earlier, DSME interventions have proven to be generally effective; however, the proportion of intervention studies that report positive effects for HbA1c, anthropometrics, physical activity, and diet was less than one-third in our review. Perhaps the features used in these interventions are somewhat traditional that worked well in mainstream population, which may not benefit women from high-risk ethnic groups living with DM. For instance, intervention features that address broader

community issues (e.g., cultural group cohesion and social support) may be more beneficial on outcomes than the more traditional features (e.g., written educational resources, didactic teaching styles). Cultural appropriateness of an intervention is advanced when ``surface structures'' such as language tailoring of brochures is supplemented with ``deep structures'' such as addressing cultural history, values, and norms [53]. Intervention data available for this review largely focuses on these aforementioned ``surface structures'' and only some data were available on ``deep structure'' features (i.e., individualized assessment, needs assessment, cultural tailoring). Future research needs to assess the effectiveness of both surface and deeper structures within DSME programming for women from high-risk ethnic groups living with DM. Research on gender differences within ethno-cultural populations is important given the potential impact of gender roles, cultural norms, beliefs and values on women and their health management. We advocate that future program evaluations include a gender-based analysis, which will provide valuable information to better tailor and deliver services to a growing population of individuals at greater risk for diabetes and its complications. The heterogeneity in study populations, interventions, and measurements of health outcomes limited our ability to conduct a meta-analysis. Thus our calculation is based on rate differences and not the effect size. The handful of studies (n = 13) that fit our criteria limited our ability to stratify our analysis by cultural group. Generally, searching for gender-specific information was challenging, as most DSME interventions are delivered and evaluated for both men and women without a gender-based analysis or stratification. We acknowledge that the populations we aggregated have different cultural values, beliefs, and experiences. However, these groups of women living with diabetes may have some parallel self-management experiences, given that they may share social similarities because of their gender and ethno-cultural experiences, which may influence the self-management processes. Given the small number of studies, our conclusions about the success of various intervention features should be interpreted with caution. 4.2. Conclusion Although the provision of DSME is pervasive and is recommended as a critical resource to assist and support diabetes selfmanagement among individuals, we have little understanding of intervention features that promote behavior change and in turn improve clinical outcomes, particularly in ethnically diverse populations. This comprehensive review provides insight into how DSME interventions can be made more effective by placing emphasis on intervention features that are potentially successful at achieving specific outcomes in women of African/Caribbean and Hispanic/Latin ethnicity. While five intervention features (i.e., hospital-based intervention setting; group intervention format; situational problem-solving; frequent sessions; or incorporating dietitians as interventionists) have a positive and broad impact on three out of the four outcomes assessed, other features also have a strong positive effect on specific outcomes that should be considered. 4.3. Practical implications Given the results from our systematic literature review, we propose that the balance between tailoring care and optimizing resources can be achieved by prioritizing common intervention features that have a positive yet broad effect on outcomes, and then tailoring intervention features based on patients' personal
