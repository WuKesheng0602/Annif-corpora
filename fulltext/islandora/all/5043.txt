SCHOOLYARD  PARKS:  HOW  THE  ESTABLISHMENT  OF  A  FORMAL  PARTNERSHIP  BETWEEN  THE   TORONTO  DISTRICT  SCHOOL  BOARD  AND  THE  CITY  OF  TORONTO  TO  GREEN  SCHOOLYARDS  CAN   INCREASE  ACCESS  TO  PUBLIC  PARK  SPACE  ACROSS  THE  CITY      ©  Marika  Franko  2016      Master  of  Planning   in   Urban  Development   Ryerson  University      ABSTRACT      Many  built-up  and  high-density  cities  such  as  the  City  of  Toronto  are  beginning  to  look  at  new   strategies   to   increase   parkland   at   a   time   when   land   is   scarcer   and   more   expensive   to   acquire.     Schoolyards   have   been   identified   as   underutilized   public   resources   since   many   of   them   are   deteriorating  and  predominantly  asphalt.    Some  cities  have  established  initiatives  that  revitalize   public   schoolyards   into   green   spaces   for   student   and   community   use,   defined   generally   as   `schoolyard   parks'.      Such   initiatives   are   based   upon   public-private   partnerships   between   city   governments,  school  boards,  park  departments,  and  other  stakeholders.    This  paper  uses  spatial   analysis   to   estimate   how   much   parkland   Toronto   District   School   Board   schoolyards   could   contribute  to  Toronto's  park  system  if  they  were  converted  to  schoolyard  parks.    It  also  reviews   four  schoolyard  park  programs  in  different  cities  to  determine  what  kind  of  program  structure   would   best   suit   Toronto,   and   it   provides   recommendations   on   how   to   implement   such   an   initiative.        Key  words:  schoolyards,  parks,  green  spaces,  partnership,  underutilized  schools

1 INTRODUCTION  
Growth   in   some   North   American   cities   has   been   increasing   exponentially   and   Toronto   is   among   the   leaders.    The  pace  of  development  has  dramatically  increased  over  the  past  decade  with  a  more  recent   focus  of  intensifying  existing  urban  areas.    While  growth  gives  rise  to  economic  vitality,  it  puts  a  strain  on   existing   infrastructure   such   as   transportation   systems,   utilities,   and   water   and   sewage   systems   if   their   capacity  is  not  increased  with  the  population.    Indeed,  much  of  Toronto's  infrastructure  has  not  kept  up   with   development   and   green   infrastructure   ­   parks   and   open   spaces   ­   is   no   exception.      Other   North   American   cities   are   facing   the   same   challenge   of   meeting   parks   and   open   space   needs,   particularly   in   denser   neighbourhoods   where   high   growth,   expensive   land   pricing,   and   increasingly   limited   space,   impedes   the   process   of   acquiring   new   land   for   parks.      Some   cities   in   North   America   are   implementing   new   strategies   to   address   green   space   needs   by   linking   existing   open   spaces   into   an   expanded   park   system.      Peter   Harnik,   a   leading   and   long-standing   researcher   on   urban   parks,   identifies   a   number   of   opportunities   in   cities   that   can   contribute   to   park   space.      In   particular,   he   identifies   an   apparent   but   often-overlooked   possibility:   "To   many   observers,   schoolyards   seem   the   best,   most   obvious   source   of   park-like   land   to   supplement   the   park   systems   of   overcrowded   cities.   And   they   are   ­   even   if   upgrading   them  into  schoolyard  parks  is  more  difficult  than   it   might   seem."(Harnik,   2010,  p110).    To  name  a  few,   cities   such   as   Boston,   New   York,   Chicago,   Denver,   Phoenix,   Houston,   and   Philadelphia   have   identified   schoolyards   as   "underutilized   resources",   as   many   are   only   used   a   few   hours   a   day   by   the   school   population  and  are  otherwise  locked  or  restrict  community  access  (Harnik,  2011;  Barker,  2013).    Urban   innovators   have   subsequently   created   programs   to   revitalize   schoolyards   and   open   them   up   to   the   community,  thereby  linking  them  to  their  parks  systems  through  various  partnerships.    Toronto  has  the   opportunity  to  learn  and  draw  ideas  from  their  successful  initiatives  and  in  turn,  create  a  strategy  that  is   unique  to  our  parks  and  school  system.    This  paper  proposes  to  increase  access  to  park  space  in  Toronto   through  the  greening  and  revitalization  of  public  schoolyards  into  `schoolyard  parks'.    

1.1 GROWING  POPULATION  ­  GROWING  PARK  DEFICIT  
Between  2006  and  2011,  the  City  of  Toronto's  population  increased  by  4.5%,  which  was  more  than  five   times   the   population   growth   reported   by   the   Census   for   the   City   of   Toronto   in   the   previous   five-year   period  (City  of  Toronto,  2012a).    Currently,  the  City's  2014  population  is  estimated  at  2,808,503  (City  of   Toronto,  2015a),  which  would  indicate  an  estimated  population  growth  of  6.8%  since  2011.    By  2041,  the  

Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  forecasts  3.40  million  people  and  1.72  million  jobs  in  the  

  

1  

   City  of  Toronto  alone  (Ibid).    As  the  City  has  grown,  the  demographics  of  residents  have  also  shifted  with   large   portions   of   the   population   growing   older,   becoming   more   culturally   diverse,   becoming   less   physically  active,  and  more  families  categorized  as  low-income  (City  of  Toronto,  2013a).    These  changes  in   demographics  as  well  as  this  projected  future  growth  impacts  Toronto's  parks  in  a  number  of  ways:  the   user  experience  and  programming  of  parks  will  need  to  evolve  according  to  the  needs  of  the  diversity  of   users;  parks  will  need  to  re-establish  their  role  as  a  resource  for  leisure  and  physical  activity;  and  access   to  parks  that  are  within  walking  distance  will  need  to  increase  as  the  growing  number  of  lower-income   families  will  not  necessarily  have  the  opportunity  to  travel  far  to  access  green  space. In   concurrence   with   population   growth,   development   in   the   City   of   Toronto   has   been   unprecedented.       The   City   has   lead   Canadian   municipalities   in   both   residential   and   non-residential   growth   with   over   195,400  residential  units  and  4.95  million  m2  of  non-residential  gross  floor  area  proposed  in  the  last  five   years   (City   of   Toronto,   2015a).      High-density   condominium   apartments   continue   to   dominate   the   construction   industry,   as   80%   of   housing   units   completed   between   2010   and   2014   were   condominium   apartments  (Ibid).    Notably,  this  booming  high-rise  residential  market  is  supplying  units  that  provide  only   small  or  nonexistent  private  open  spaces  (i.e.  backyards).    This  housing  trend,  coupled  with  the  increasing   population,  indicates  that  more  people  than  ever  before  will  be  using  Toronto's  network  of  parks  as  their   immediate   access   to   greenery   diminishes.      This   places   more   pressure   on   existing   parks   in   high-density   areas   and   even   greater   pressure   on   the   City   of   Toronto   to   acquire   more   parks   for   residents   in   these   densifiying  neighbourhoods.     The  Downtown  and  Central  Waterfront  area  contains  the  largest  percentage  of  proposed  development  in   all   of   the   City's   growth   management   areas   (Ibid).      As   more   people   want   to   live   and   work   downtown,   parkland  acquisition  and  maintenance  in  this  area  is  becoming  much  more  of  a  challenge  for  a  number  of   reasons  as  outlined  below:

LAND  IS  EXPENSIVE  AND  DIFFICULT  TO  FIND:  In  some  parts  of  downtown,  land  can  go  for  $30  to   $60  million  an  acre  (as  cited  in  the  City  of  Toronto's  Downtown  Toronto:  Trends  Issues  Intensification,  p77).   THE  CITY  HAS  TO  PAY  MARKET  VALUE,  EVEN  FOR  PUBLIC  LAND     THE   ACQUISITION   PROCESS   IS   SLOW   AND   RIGID:      City   staff   are   not   allowed   much   negotiating   room   to   offer   more   than   the   appraised   market   value   of   land   and   the   acquisition   approval   process  can  also  take  six  months  to  a  year,  putting  them  at  risk  at  being  out-paced  and  out-bid   by  other  buyers  (as  cited  in  the  City  of  Toronto's  Downtown  Toronto:  Trends  Issues  Intensification,  p77).   THERE  ARE  MANY  COMPETING  DEMANDS:  The  existing  parks,  many  of  which  are  smaller  in  size   than   other   parts   of   the   city,   are   strained   as   population   and   density   rise.   Finding   room   to   accommodate   all   the   things   people   want   to   do--play   with   their   kids,   walk   their   dog,   read   a   book,  play  sports,  retreat  into  nature,  listen  to  a  music  performance--becomes  more  difficult.   CENTRALLY   LOCATED   PARKS   WORK   HARD:   Many   parks   are   used   by   an   increasing   amount   of   residents,  but  also  by  workers  and  tourists.  They  are  also  the  site  of  many  events  and  activities   throughout  the  year,  causing  extra  stress  on  facilities.   HIGH-USE  PARKS  ARE  COSTLY  TO  BUILD  AND  MAINTAIN:  Because  of  the  amount  of  activity  and   intense  use,  high-use  parks  require  high-quality  materials  and  frequent  upkeep.

Creative   green   space   acquisition,   planning,   design   and   management   strategies   will   be   required   for   the   City  of  Toronto,  particularly  in  these  high-density  areas,  to  ensure  that  the  growing  population  has  access   to  parkland  that  meets  their  needs.  

1.2 DETERIORATING  SCHOOLYARDS  &  SCHOOL  CLOSURES  
Schoolyards  have  a  history  of  being  a  space  for  play,  recreation,  and  greenery  within  their  communities.     Unfortunately,  many  public  schoolyards  today  consist  of  asphalt,  few  play  structures,  and  limited  green   space,   and   these   conditions   have   contributed   to   the   underutilization   of   schoolyards   by   children   and   community   members   (Belcher,   2003).      One   reason   for   such   bleak   conditions   is   that   maintaining   green   schoolyards   that   are   used   heavily   by   children   is   difficult   without   proper   design,   construction   and   maintenance   protocols   (Weiss,   2000).      School   boards   have   found   it   too   costly   to   upkeep   these   poorly   designed   grass   areas   and   thus,   many   schoolyards   have   been   paved   over   with   asphalt,   likening   their   resemblance  to  jail-yards  (Harnik,  2010).       Another   factor   that   contributes   to   the   underutilization   of   schoolyards   is   the   increasingly   structured   programming  of  children's  lives  (Rivkin,  1997).    A  child  has  normally  spent  more  than  a  third  of  its  waking  

  

3  

   hours  in  school  but  until  recently,  afterschool  time  was  left  fairly  unstructured  and  many  children  were   left   to   their   own   devices.      Today,   afterschool   hours   are   often   spent   in   childcare,   participating   in   team   sports,   lessons,   camps   and   in   cars,   shuttling   children   to   and   from   their   extra-curricular   activities   (Ibid).   After  all  of  that,  whatever  "free  time"  is  left  over  is  now  predominantly  spent  indoors  with  children  using   various   electronics   to   entertain   themselves   (Burdette   &   Whitaker,   2005;   Rivkin,   1997).      Neighbourhood   play   has   also   diminished   as   many   parents   work   long   hours   and   a   lack   of   supervision   has   now   been   strongly  associated  with  a  culture  of  fear  (Rivkin,  1997,  Faber  Taylor  &  Kuo,  2006).    All  of  these  factors   have  contributed  to  children's  loss  of  access  to,  and  active  participation  in,  green  spaces.           Public   schoolyards   in   Toronto   are   declining   both   in   physical   appearance   and   in   numbers.      Physically   speaking,   most   schoolyards   in   the   Toronto   District   School   Board   (TDSB)   are   outdated   and   have   been   deteriorating  for  a  number  of  years.    Many  of  them  are  also  predominantly  asphalt  with  few,  old  or  no   play   structures   to   keep   children   engaged   and   active.      As   such,   they   do   not   benefit   school   children   physically   or   psychologically,   nor   do   they   benefit   the   surrounding   community   and   environment   in   any   meaningful  capacity.    As  a  result  of  their  condition,  many  schoolyards  also  do  not  contribute  to  the  City's   ambition   of   increasing   green   spaces   in   urban   environments   at   a   time   when   acquiring   land   for   parks   is   increasingly  difficult.       The  size  of  schoolyards  and  the  number  of  school  properties  has  also  been  decreasing  over  the  last  few   years.    In  2012,  the  TDSB  announced  that  it  was  considering  selling  parts  of  their  schoolyards  in  order  to   generate  revenue  for  renovations  and  also  to  help  pay  down  some  of  the  Board's  capital  deficit  that  had   prompted   the   Ministry   of   Education   to   cut   off   funding   for   projects   (Hammer,   2012).      While   the   TDSB   eventually  rejected  the  idea,  since  then  it  has  sold  a  few  surplus  school  properties  and  severed  pieces  of   schoolyards   in   a   more   discrete   manner   (City   of   Toronto,   2014a).      Three   years   later,   however,   the   TDSB   has  released  a  list  of  130  schools  that  it  has  identified  as  being  "underutilized"  (meaning  they  are  running   at  65%  capacity  or  less)  that  could  be  slated  for  closure  (Howlett  &  Fatima,  2015).    If  these  sites  are  then   deemed  surplus,  it  will  result  in  the  loss  of  green  spaces  now  used  by  community  members  for  leisure  and   recreational  activities  (City  of  Toronto,  2014a).    While  these  properties  are  owned  by  the  Toronto  District   School   Board,   they   are   still   public   assets   and   their   important   role   as   a   community   hub   is   a   factor   that   ought  to  be  given  greater  weight  in  future  real  estate  decisions.

1.3 RESEARCH  QUESTIONS  
The  purpose  of  the  first  two  research  questions  is  to  quantify  the  potential  role  of  the  public  schoolyard   as  formal  green  space,  as  well  as  if  and  how  a  potential  initiative  could  benefit  Torontonians:   1) How  much  total  parkland  would  be  added  if:   a. All  TDSB  schoolyards  were  converted  and  added  to  parkland  system?   b. If  only  underutilized  schoolyards  were  converted  and  added  to  the  system?   2) How  many  people  would  benefit  from  the  increase  in  access  to  green  space?      The  third  research  question  examines  the  feasibility  of  a  potential  initiative:     3) How  do  initiatives  in  other  municipalities  or  jurisdictions  green  schoolyards  and  incorporate  them   into  their  park  systems?      Ultimately,  this  research  paper  answers  the  overarching  research  question:  will  converting  schoolyards  

into  schoolyard  parks  increase  access  to  green  space  in  Toronto?  

1.4 PAPER  STRUCTURE  
CHAPTER   2:   BACKGROUND   ­   Following   this   introductory   chapter,   the   next   chapter   provides   an   overview   of   the   current   City   of   Toronto   context   from   both   a   park/Parks,   Forestry   and   Recreation   perspective,  and  a  TDSB  perspective.    The  obstacles  that  each  of  these  two  groups  is  facing  is  presented   to   understand   why   these   issues   exist   and   how   these   obstacles   can   be   overcome.      Then   the   existing   relationship   between   the   City   and   the   TDSB   is   examined   in   order   to   understand   what   policies   and   agreements  are  currently  promoting  a  positive  relationship  between  the  two  entities  and  what  interests   are  impeding  the  establishment  of  a  formal  partnership.   CHAPTER  3:  LITERATURE  REVIEW  ­  This  chapter  concisely  explains  the  many  environmental,  health,   economic,   educational,   and   developmental   benefits   that   green   spaces   provide.      A   brief   survey   of   the   current   school   greening   initiatives   in   Toronto   is   then   presented   to   [see]   review   how   these   programs   implement  their  projects  and  at  what  scale.   CHAPTER   4:   M ETHODOLOGY   ­   This   chapter   explains   in   detail   the   methods   used   to   complete   the   analysis   portion   of   this   paper.   It   describes   how   a   geographic   information   system   (GIS)   was   used   to   spatially  present,  analyze  and  interpret  data  on  TDSB  schools  and  Toronto's  parks  system  for  the  first  part   of   this   paper's   analysis.      This   chapter   also   describes   the   second   analysis   component   of   this   paper,   including   the   rationale   and   process   undertaken   to   complete   a   review   of   case   studies   that   have   implemented  schoolyard  park  initiatives.

   CHAPTER   5:   ANALYSIS   ­   This   chapter   details   the   analysis   process   and   the   findings   from   the   two   methods.      First,   it   describes   and   illustrates   the   possible   contribution   schoolyards   can   have   to   Toronto's   parks   system   if   they   were   converted   to   schoolyard   parks.      Second,   the   comprehensive   program   review   examines  each  case  study  to  provide  a  foundational  understanding  of  each  program's  structure  and  the   initiative's  successes  and  challenges.     CHAPTER   6:   CONCLUSION   ­   This   chapter   describes   the   concept   of   a   `schoolyard   park'   from   the   research  and  analysis  presented  in  previous  chapters,  and  then  it  explains  how  this  concept  can  benefit   the  City  of  Toronto  if  applied.   CHAPTER  7:  RECOM M ENDATIONS  ­  This  last  chapter  sets  out  steps  that  the  Ministry  of  Education,   the  TDSB,  and  the  City  of  Toronto  to  implement  to  create  a  schoolyard  park  initiative  for  public  schools   across  the  municipality.

2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 CURRENT  OVERVIEW  OF  TORONTO  PARKS  
2.1.1 PARKLAND  IN  NUMBERS  
The  City  of  Toronto's  Parks,  Forestry  and  Recreation  Division  (PF&R)  has  a  vision  to  turn  Toronto  into  a   "City  within  a  Park".    Currently  the  City's  park  system  is  made  up  of  1,600  parks  that  cover  over  12.7%  of   the   City's   area   (City   of   Toronto,   2013a).         The   8,000   hectares   of   parks   include   the   expansive   ravine   systems  and  other  open  spaces  such  as  natural  areas  and  parks,  with  features  that  include  splash  pads,   basketball  courts  and  ice  rinks  (Ibid).    While  the  PF&R  is  in  charge  of  managing  all  of  this  land,  the  Toronto   and  Region  Conservation  Authority  (TRCA)  owns  approximately  46%  or  3,700  hectares  of  Toronto's  public   parkland,   most   of   which   are   the   natural   areas   located   along   the   ravine   systems   and   Lake   Ontario   shoreline  (see  Figure  1)  (Ibid).      

  
Figure  1:  Map  of  City  of  Toronto  Parks  Systems  Lands  (City  of  Toronto,  2013a,  p9)  

As   shown   in   Figure   1,   the   City   of   Toronto   is   indeed   speckled   with   public   parkland,   but   is   all   of   this   greenery   enough?      The   traditional   standard   for   parks   that   was   first   promoted   by   the   U.S.   National   Recreation  and  Park  Association  in  the  early  part  of  the  20th  century  was  a  target  of  10  acres  for  every  

  

7  

   1,000   persons   (Evergreen,   2004).   Using   this   ratio,   some   municipalities   in   Canada   have   established   parkland  standards  to  measure  their  effectiveness  at  meeting  community  green  space  needs  even  as  they   have   created   targets   that   are   specific   to   their   city   (Ibid).      In   2004,   Evergreen   Canada   did   a   survey   of   municipalities   with   established   parkland   standards   and   compared   their   green   space   standards   to   their   actual   provision   of   green   space   (see   Figure   2).      As   can   be   observed,   Toronto   is   one   of   the   few   municipalities  that  does  not  have  a  municipal  park  standard.      

Figure  2:  Green  Space  Provision  and  Standards  in  Canadian  Urban  Municipalities  (Evergreen,  2004,   p8)  

  

Based   on   these   numbers,   it   was   found   that   the   average   park   standard   was   2.79   hectares   per   1,000   persons.    Using  this  type  of  measure,  the  City  of  Toronto  in  2009  overall  had  a  relatively  good  average  of   parkland  compared  to  other  North  American  cities  (see  Table  1):

   CITY   Toronto   Ottawa   Montreal   Chicago   New  York   San  Francisco   Boston   Parkland  in  acres  per  1,000  persons   7.88   19.75   2.96   4.2   4.6   7.0   8.3  

Table  1:  Acres  of  parkland  per  1,000  residents  in  North  American  Cities   (As  cited  in  Harvey  (2010,  p16):  the  Canadian  numbers  are  from  Our  Common  Grounds,   page  18.  and  U.S.  numbers  are  from  Trust  for  Public  Land,  2009  Park  Facts,  page  11.)  

Although  this  number  is  fairly  high,  it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  largest  amount  of  parkland  is   in   the   ravine   systems   in   the   eastern   and   western   portions   of   the   city,   as   illustrated   in   Figure   1.      While   these  areas  of  the  City  seemingly  have  adequate  access  to  park  space  thanks  to  the  ravines,  the  typology   of  the  green  space  that  the  ravines  provide  may  not  actually  serve  the  needs  of  the  communities.    Harvey   argues,  "Many  neighbourhoods  in  these  areas  are  low-income  and  have  very  high  immigrant  populations   for  whom  large  ravine  parks  are  not  ideal  places  to  meet  their  needs  for  recreation  or  relaxation"  (2010,   p16).      Toronto's   park   spaces   range   in   size   and   setting   and   they   offer   many   features,   facilities   and   amenities  that  aim  to  support  and  reflect  their  community  needs  (City  of  Toronto,  2013a).    As  such,  they   are  classified  into  five  park  types  that  are  based  on  size,  facilities,  and  their  role  within  the  parks  system:   parkettes   (typically   <   0.5h),   neighbourhood   parks   (typically   >   0.5h),   Community   Parks   (typically   <   3h),   District   Parks   (typically   >   5h),   and   City   Parks   (typically   >   15h)   (Ibid,   p57).      The   denser   parts   of   the   City,   particularly  downtown,  have  the  least  amount  of  parkland  (see  Table  2):      CITY  OF  TORONTO  AREA   Scarborough   Etobicoke   East  York   North  York   York   Toronto   Parkland  in  acres  per  1,000  persons   11.81   10.13   7.56   7.43   4.67   4.54

   The   City's   overall   parkland   ratios   seem   to   imply   that   the   City   overall   has   enough   park   space   for   its   residents.      However,   this   ratio   does   not   reflect   the   different   classifications   of   its   park   spaces   nor   can   it   measure   if   the   needs   of   its   surrounding   communities   are   being   met   by   their   local   parks.      The   "Local   Parkland   Provision   Map   8B"   in   the   City   of   Toronto   Official   Plan   (2010a)   uses   this   parkland   ratio   to   illustrate  what  areas  in  Toronto  are  `park  poor'  (see  Figure  3).  

Figure  3:  City  of  Toronto  Local  Parkland  Provision  (City  of  Toronto,  2010a,  Map  8-B)  

There  are,  however,  a  number  of  other  limitations  using  the  standard  ratio  of  area  to  population.  First,  it   does   not   take   into   account   population   density,   which   is   a   challenge   that   not   only   greatly   affects   the   provision   of   parks   to   persons,   but   many   other   services.      A   city   must   provide   necessary   supports   and   services  to   their   residents   using  a   limited   amount   of  money   and   land   availability,   and   therefore   it   must   prioritize  such  services  based  on  need  (Harnik,  2010).    It  is  also  not  feasible  or  realistic  for  cities  that  are   already  built  up  to  start  converting  thousands  of  acres  into  public  parkland  to  meet  a  certain  ratio  (Ibid).     Consequently,  the  ratio  of  park  space  to  persons  can  be  used  as  a  tool  to  measure  the  overall  amount  of   park  space  that  a  city  has,  particularly  in  certain  neighbourhoods,  but  it  should  not  necessarily  be  used  as   a  standard  to  measure  up  to.    Focusing  on  the  needs  of  the  community  and  programming  existing  green   spaces  to  be  more  effective  in  meeting  these  needs  is  arguably  a  more  important  measure  (Ibid).    

  

10  

   Arguably,  a  better  quantitative  measure  to  use  is  the  average  distance  to  any  park  from  any  residence.     Many  North  American  cities  such  as  New  York,  Calgary,  London,  Mississauga  and  Ottawa  use  this  type  of   measurement  to  create  a  standard  for  park  development  based  on  a  maximum  distance  to  parkland.    For   example,  the  City  of  Ottawa's   Official  Plan  (OP)  has  set  a  target  that  in  residential  areas  all  homes  should   be  located  within  400  metres  of  green  space,  or  accessible  in  a  5-10  minute  walk  (City  of  Ottawa,  2003).     The  City  of  Mississauga  has  also  identified  a  goal  of  bringing  every  resident  within  400  metres  of  a  public   park  outside  of  its  designated  Growth  Areas  (City  of  Mississauga,  2014).       Currently,  the  City  of  Toronto  has  no  parkland  target  or  standard,  whether  measured  by  ratio  or  distance,   as  the  City  argues  that  it  is  "neither  appropriate  nor  practical"  (City  of  Toronto,  2000,  p6).    However,  the   PF&R  Division  has  mapped  out  the  City's  parkland  based  on  a  walking  distance  of  500  metres  (see  Figure  

4).      While   it   may   seem   that   Toronto   is   adequately   serviced   by   parks,   as   mentioned   this   measurement  
does  not  take  into  consideration  the  size  of  the  park,  the  number  of  people  using  it,  and  if  these  parks  are   actually  meeting  the  needs  of  Torontonians.    Additionally,  Figure  3  above  clearly  illustrates  which  areas  of   Toronto  are  in  need  of  parkland  due  to  low  provisions.

   As   part   of   this   project's   analysis,   this   paper   will   apply   this   tool   of   measurement   to   TDSB   schools   to   determine  how  much  of  an  increase  in  access  to  parks  schoolyards  could  provide  if  they  were  included  in   this  analysis.  

2.1.2 POLICY  CONTEXT  
All  planning  documents  from  provincial  to  municipal  levels  speak  to  the  protection  and  development  of   green   spaces.      The   Provincial   Policy   Statement   (Ministry   of   Municipal   Affiars   and   Housing,   2014),   the   policy   foundation   for   regulating   the   development   and   use   of   land   in   Ontario,   asserts   in   s.1.5.1   that   healthy,  active  communities  should  be  promoted  by:    

(b)   providing   for   a   full   range   and   equitable   distribution   of   publicly-accessible   built   and   natural   settings  for  recreation,  including  facilities,  parklands,  open  space  areas,  trails  and,  where  practical,   water-based  resources.    
   The   Growth   Plan   for   the   Greater   Golden   Horseshoe   (Ministry   of   Infrastructure,   2006)   more   specifically   recommends   that   municipalities   should   "develop   a   system   of   publicly   accessible   parkland,   open   space   and  trails"  (s.4.2.1.4)  and  they  are  "encouraged  to  establish  an  urban  space  system  within  built-up  areas,   which  may  include  rooftop  gardens,  communal  courtyards  and  public  space"  (s.4.2.1.5).   The   City   of   Toronto   Official   Plan   (2010a)   speaks   to   the   importance   of   green   spaces   in   a   number   of   sections:  s.2.3.1  Green  Space  System  and  Waterfront  policies  seek  to  preserve  green  space,  ensure  public   access,   and   build   connectivity;   s.3.1.1   Public   Realm   policies   support   accessible   parks,   natural   areas   and   open  spaces  to  meet  needs  of  recreation,  nature  and  heritage;  and  s.3.2.3  Parks  and  Open  Spaces  policies   seek   to   build   the   park   system,   and   outline   parkland   requirements   for   new   development.      More   specifically,  in  this  last  section  the  OP  recognizes  that  growing  the  parks  system  requires:    

1.   (c)   protecting   access   to   existing   publicly   accessible   open   spaces,   as   well   as   expanding   the   system  of  open  spaces  and  developing  open  space  linkages;  and     1.   (d)   promoting   and   using   private   open  space   and   recreation   facilities,   including   areas   suitable   for  community  or  allotment  gardening,  to  supplement  the  City's  parks,  facilities  and  amenities.  
   These   sections   in   particular   speak   to   "protecting,   promoting,   and   using"   publicly   accessible   and   private   open  spaces,  both  of  which  the  schoolyards  of  the  TDSB  fall  under.    The  OP  includes  "school  yards"  in  its   definition   of   open   spaces   (s.3-6),   so   when   the   planning   document   is   read,   it   can   be   assumed   that   any   mention  of  open  space  in  the  OP  indirectly  references  schoolyards.          

  

12  

   In   addition,   s.3.2.2   Community   Services   and   Facilities   identifies   schools   as   a   community   resource   to   be   preserved  and  improved.    It  also  speaks  to  the  acquisition  of  school  properties  by  the  City  in  order  to  keep   such  lands  accessible  by  the  community:  

2.  Keeping  surplus  schools  for  community  service  purposes  will  be  pursued  where  the  need  for   such  facilities  has  been  identified  as  a  priority.  Where  this  is  not  feasible,  alternate  uses  of  closed   schools   must   be   compatible   with   the   surrounding   neighbourhood   and   should   provide   City   residents  with  continued  access  to  school  playgrounds  and  playing  fields.  

2.1.3 FUNDING  &  EXPENDITURE  
The   Parks,   Forestry   and   Recreation   Division   of   the   City   of   Toronto   is   the   lowest   funded   parks   and   recreation   department   of   a   municipality   within   Canada   when   compared   to   other   major   cities   in   the   country  (see  Figure  5).    While  it  can  be  argued  that  the  City  must  provide  many  other  services  to  a  very   large  population,  providing  green  infrastructure  to  residents  is  evidently  a  very  low  priority.

PF&R  provides  a  wide  variety  of  leisure  and  recreational  opportunities  for  all  Toronto  residents  through   operating  and  maintaining  parks,  playing  fields,  playgrounds,  recreation  centres  and  amenities,  along  with   trails,  forests,  meadows,  marshes,  and  ravines  (City  of  Toronto,  2015c).    The  2015  operating  budget  for  

  

13  

   PF&R  was  $436.604  million  and  it  is  broken  down  by  services,  with  Community  Recreation  taking  50%  of   the  budget,  followed  by  Parks  with  34%,  and  Urban  Forestry  at  16%  (see  Figure  6)  (Ibid).                                                   
Figure  6:  Parks,  Forestry  and  Recreation  Operating  Budget  Breakdown  and  Budget  Funding   Sources  (City  of  Toronto,  2015c,  p3)  

The   Community   Recreation   department   delivers   recreation   programs   and   services,   and   it   develops   and   repairs   recreational   facilities.      The   Urban   Forestry   department   maintains   and   enhances   the   City's   trees.     The   Parks   department   implements   the   Parks   Plan   that   guides   the   design,   development   and   service   standards  of  new  parks,  and  maintains  and  repairs  existing  parks  (see  Figure  7).     

Figure  7:  Parks  Department  Service  Budget  and  Funding  (City  of  Toronto,  2015c,  p34)  

  

The   operational   impact   of   new   recreation   facilities   and   parks   totalled   $2.108   million   in   2015   (City   of   Toronto,   2015c).      Consequently,   an   additional   $1.322   million   of   funding   will   be   needed   for   the   maintenance   of   the   new   parks   and   park   enhancements   (Ibid).      Based   on   the   PF&R's   2015   Service   Performance  review,  it  cost  approximately  $14,396  per  hectare  to  maintain  parkland  in  2014  (Ibid).    With   an  expected  cost  increase  of  2%  each  year  due  to  cost-of-living  adjustments,  as  well  as  the  department's  

  

14  

   objective  of  acquiring  and  adding  more  parkland  to  the  4,398  hectares  already  maintained,  the  City  will   need  to  find  more  sources  of  funding  to  maintain  old  and  new  parks  (Ibid).  

2.1.4 PARKLAND  ACQUISITIONS  STRATEGY  
The   City's   capital   budget   for   acquiring   new   parks   or   making   improvements   to   existing   parks   is   supplemented  a  number  of  ways.    The   Planning  Act  establishes  the  authority  for  municipalities  to  require   a  parkland  dedication  or  cash-in-lieu  payments  as  a  condition  of  development  or  redevelopment  of  land   under   Sections   42   (development),   51.1   (subdivision)   and   53   (consent)   (City   of   Toronto,   2010c).   The   amount  of  dedication  required  depends  on  the  type  of  development  and  deposited  into  various  parkland   reserve  funds.    The  policy  tools  to  acquire  parkland  amounts  are  outlined  in  the  box  below:  

SECTION  42   ·

Section  42  of  the   Planning  Act  allows  the  City  to  require  5%  of  the  land  area  for  residential   developments  be  park  space  or  2%  for  commercial/industrial  projects.  If  this  generates  too   small  a  piece  of  land  for  a  usable  park  OR  the  development  site  is  deemed  unsuitable  for  a   park,  the  City  can  take  cash-in-lieu  of  parkland,  with  payment  equaling  the  value  of  the  land   that   would   have   been   provided.   This   money   is   split   50/50   between   citywide   and   district   accounts  and  split  50/50  again  between  land  acquisition  and  park  improvements.  
Downtown  is  designated  a  Parkland  Acquisition  Priority  Area,  which  means  the  City  uses  the   Alternative   Parkland   Dedication   Rate  allowed  under   Section   42.   In   Toronto,   the   City   takes   0.4  hectares  per  300  dwelling  units,  but  the  Planning  Act  allows  up  to  1  hectare  to  be  taken.   In  priority  areas,  any  cash  received  above  5%  of  the  land  area  goes  towards  parks  or  park   improvements  in  the  vicinity  of  the  development.  

·

DEVELOPMENT  CHARGES   · The   Development  Charges  Act  allows  the  City  to  require  payments  from  developers  to  help   cover   some   of   the   growth-related   infrastructure   costs   associated   with   development.   This   money  can  be  used  for  park  improvements,  but  not  land  acquisition.    

SECTION  37  
·

Section  37  of  the   Planning  Act  allows  the  City  to  negotiate  money  for  community  benefits   from   developers   in  exchange   for   approving   increases   in   the   height   or  density   above   what   current   zoning   allows.   This   is   a   tool   designed   to   help   address   the   impact   of   high-density   development   with   benefits   tied   to   the   area   surrounding   the   developmet.   In   downtown,   parks   and   open   space   improvements   accounted   for   the   largest   number   of   Section   37   agreements.   (as   taken   from:   City   of   Toronto.

   As   of   September   2013,   the   balance   in   the   Parkland   Acquisition   Reserve   Funds   was   $101.9   million,   of   which   $3   million   was   committed   by   Council   for   parkland   acquisition   (City   of   Toronto,   2013c).     Additionally,  in  the  Parkland  Development  Reserve  Funds  there  was  a  balance  of  $69  million  at  the  end  of   September   2013   (Ibid).      In   the   last   three   years,   developers   have   paid   the   City   $298.5   million   for   parks   compensation   (Lorinc   &   Noble,   2015).      However,   it   is   unclear   what   happens   with   all   the   money   that   is   being  poured  into  the  ever-growing  parkland  acquisition  reserve  funds;  "there's  no  analysis  of  where  the   money   comes   from,   how   it   is   spent   and   whether   these   investments   in   Toronto's   public   open   spaces   conform  to  council's  long  standing  parkland  provisions,  which  are  laid  out  in  the  Official  Plan"  (Ibid,  para.   7).    Moreover,  it  has  been  found  that  even  though  development  rates  have  been  at  an  all  time  high  the   past   few   years   and   subsequently   parkland   sums   generated   are   at   an   all   time   high,   the   rate   of   land   acquired   for   parks   has   actually   diminished.      From   1998   to   2009,   the   City   averaged   19   ha   of   parks   purchased   per   year,   but   since   2009   the   figure   has   dropped   by   half   to   9.2   ha   per   year   (Ibid).      City   Staff   outline  a  number  of  reasons  for  this.    While  there  may  be  money  to  acquire  parks,  there  is  not  enough   room  in  the  budget  for  operating  and  maintaining  the  new  parks  (Ibid).    Further,  the  City  cannot  compete   in  the  downtown  real  estate  market  where  an  acre  of  land  can  sell  for  $30-$60  million.    These  challenges   demonstrate   the   need   for   a   City-wide   strategy   that   includes   a   financing   structure   based   on   the   City's   various   parkland   funds,   and   that   speaks   to   a   new   approach   of   obtaining   and   maintaining   parkland   that   does  not  necessarily  force  the  City  to  compete  on  the  open  market  for  more  land.  

2.2 CURRENT  OVERVIEW  OF  TORONTO  DISTRICT  SCHOOL  BOARD  
The  TDSB  is  one  of  the  largest  landholders  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area,  second  only  to  the  City's  Parks,   Forestry,   and   Recreation   Division   with,   some   588   school   properties   that   total   over   5,000   acres   (Volz,   2009).    These  properties  serve  approximately  245,000  students  each  year.  

2.2.1 FUNDING  &  EXPENDITURE  
THE  M INISTRY  OF  EDUCATION     The   Ministry   of   Education   provides   the   bulk   of   operating   funds   to   Ontario's   72   district   school   boards   through   the   annual   Grants   for   Student   Needs   (GSN),   also   known   as   "the   funding   formula"   (Ministry   of   Education,  2015a).  This  grant,  consisting  of  two  major  allocations  (school  operations  and  school  renewal),   is  projected  to  total  $2.38  billion  in  2015-16  (Ibid).    

  

16  

   For   the   year   2014­2015,   the   Ministry   of   Education   introduced   the   School   Board   Efficiencies   and   Modernization   strategy   to   provide   incentives   for   boards   to   make   more   efficient   use   of   school   space   (Ministry  of  Education,  2015b).  It  decreases  funding  grants  that  support  the  operation  of  school  space  in   underutilized  schools  to  incentivize  the  boards  to  seek  out  additional  community  partnerships  (Ministry   of   Education,   2014b).      This   action   seems   to   demonstrate   that   the   Ministry   is   open,   willing,   and   encouraging  the  development  of  partnerships  between  school  districts  and  community  groups.   Additionally,   beginning   in   2014,   the   Ministry   of   Education   pledged   to   make   a   large   new   investment   totalling   $1.25   billion   in   funding   for   school   improvements   for   the   next   three   years;   $250   million   of   this   was   allocated   to   the   TDSB   in   2014-2015,   and   $500   million   will   be   allocated   in   2015-2016   (Ministry   of   Education,  2014a).    This  "School  Condition  Improvement  Funding  Program"  identifies  the  renewal  needs   of   all   school   board   districts   in   Ontario   through   the   "Condition   Assessment   Program"   (Ministry   of   Education,  2015e).     THE  TORONTO  DISTRICT  SCHOOL  BOARD   The  TDSB's  current  operating  budget  is  $3.06  billion  and  its  capital  budget  is  $190  million  (TDSB,  2014a).     The  TDSB  obtains  most  of  its  funding  from  the  Province  through  the  GSN  grant  mentioned  above,  and  it  is   generated  primarily  by  the  number  of  students  enrolled  in  a  school.    The  TDSB  also  generates  additional   revenues   to   support   core   operations   through   such   things   as   tuition   fees   from   international   students,   rental  and  permit  income,  cafeteria  income  and  bank  interest  income  (Ibid).    The  Board  also  provides  a   budget   allocation   to   schools   on   a   per   pupil   basis   for   classroom   programs,   and   the   school   principals,   in   consultation  with  school  staff  and  parents,  have  the  discretion  on  how  to  best  use  these  funds  to  support   school  improvement  plans  (Ibid).       The   Board   is   running   a   projected   deficit   of   $16.5   million   for   2015-2016   (Ibid)   and   the   aging   school   infrastructure  is  contributing  to  deferred  maintenance  tasks  that  are  now  exceeding  $3  billion  (Toronto   Lands  Corporation,  2015).    As  a  result,  there  have  been  changes  to  the  funding  structures  to  ensure  that   overall  operating  costs  are  reduced  year  over  year  (TDSB,  2014).    This  is  one  of  the  main  motivations  for   the   TDSB   to   seriously   consider   selling   a   number   of   school   properties   that   have   been   deemed   underutilized.      In   2014-2015,   the   Ministry   reduced   funding   for   low   enrolment   schools   by   $10   million   under   the   School   Operations   Grant   to   pressure   the   TDSB   to   begin   selling   schools   that   were   no   longer   running  near  capacity,  and  it  slashed  the  School  Renewal  Grant  by  67%  (Ibid).

2.2.2 SURPLUS  &  UNDERUTILIZED  SCHOOLS  
Declining  enrolments  and  a  provincial  funding  formula  that  is  based  on  pupil  enrolment  has  put  the  TDSB   under   pressure   to   sell   off   surplus   property   to   pay   for   capital   and   overdue   maintenance   repairs.      At   the   very   start   of   2015,   a   commissioned   report   entitled  "Review   of   the   Toronto   District   School   Board"   was   submitted   to   the   Ontario   Minister   of   Education,   which   outlined   a   number   of   major   issues   within   the   Board   (Wilson,   2015).   In   response   to   the   review,   Minister   Liz   Sandals   issued  13   directives  that   Toronto   District  School  Board  (TDSB)  Trustees  had  to  comply  with  by  February  13,  2015.    As  part  of  Directive  Nine,   Sandals   directed   the   TDSB   to   indicate   how   the   Board   intends   to   reduce   underutilized   space   across   its   school,  which  are  defined  as  schools  that  are  running  at  65%  capacity  or  less  (Sandals,  2015).    The  TDSB   responded   to   this   directive   on   January   28,   2015,   releasing   a   list   of   130   schools   that   were   deemed   underutilized  and  potentially  under  review  for  possible  closure  (City  of  Toronto,  2015d).    A  week  later,  the   TDSB   released   a   second   list   of   60   schools   for   possible   closure   by   2021   as   part   of   an   approved   10-year   capital  plan  (Ibid).   According  to   Section  194(3)  of  the  Education  Act,  once  an  underutilized  school  property  is  reviewed  and   it  is  determined  that  the  property  is  no  longer  required  to  meet  the  long-term  accommodation  needs  of   its  students,   it  is  then  declared  "surplus"  and  transferred  to  the  Toronto  Lands  Corporation  (TLC)  to  be   sold  (TLC,  2015).    The  "Toronto  Lands  Corporation  was  created  in  April  2008  with  a  mandate  to  optimize   value   obtained   through   redevelopment   and/or   sale   of   TDSB   properties   that   are   no   longer   required   to   meet  the  long  term  accommodation  needs  of  the  Board"  (TLC,  2014,  p1).    The  TDSB  assigns  properties  for   the   TLC   to   manage   and   these   include   closed   schools,   the   sale   of   schools,   schools   that   continue   to   be   leased,  vacant  schools,  and  some  sites  that  are  used  for  TDSB  administration  or  plant  operations  (Ibid).     As  of  August  31,  2014,  a  total  of  65  sites  have  been  sold  since  its  establishment  (Ibid).    Roughly  half  of   these  properties  were  sold  to  developers  and  the  other  half  were  sold  to  other  school  boards  and  public   agencies  (Warzecha,  2014).   While  the  TDSB  has  been  under  scrutiny  for  years  by  the  provincial  governments  for  not  closing  schools  as   enrolment   declined,   and   though   it   may   seem   like   selling   school   properties   is   one   of   the   few   viable   and   practical   solutions   for   the   TDSB,   selling   school   properties   may   have   numerous   negative   impacts   on   the   community  at  large.    The  Elementary  Teachers  of  Toronto  found  that  the  majority  of  the  60  schools  under   review  served  vulnerable  populations:  68%  of  the  48  elementary  schools  ranked  above  the  board  median   for  high  socio-economic  need;  40%  rank  among  the  20%  most  highest-in-need  schools  for  at-risk  students  

  

18  

   in   the   City,   and   45%   of   the   schools   are   located   in   communities   of   such   great   need   that   they   already   receive   extra   funding   through   the   "Model   Schools   for   Inner   Cities"   program   in   order   to   build   outreach   and  provide  services  and  supports  to  their  communities  (Brown,  2015).       As  such,  many  of  these  schools  also  act  as  vibrant  community  hubs  in  their  neighbourhooods,  particularly   those  located  in  vulnerable  neighbourhoods  by  providing  space  and  facilities  for  childcare,  family  centres,   and  community  programming;  "48%  of  the  elementary  schools  targeted  also  have  child-care  centres,  at   least   77%   house   community   programs,   and   27%   have   parenting   centres,   which   the   ministry   does   not   count  as  part  of  the  school's  "utilization  rate,"  the  key  trigger  for  a  school  to  be  reviewed  for  closure."   (Brown,  2015,  para.  25).    Moreover,  in  the  next  few  years  increased  enrolment  in  elementary  schools  is   projected  to  occur  (Ibid).    Forecasted  change  in  birth  rates  and  migration  rates  will  have  a  large  impact  on   school  access,  and  consequently  school  funding.    "Elementary  enrolment  has  increased  by  approximately   570  students  between  2010-2011  and  over  the  next  10  years,  growth  is  projected  to  be  in  the  range  of   5,000   to   7,000   students"   (TDSB,   2014a,   p6).      Many   councilors,   parents,   and   community   members   fear   that  once  a  school  property  is  sold,  it  can  never  be  reacquired.      

2.3 CITY  OF  TORONTO  AND  TDSB  RELATIONSHIP  
2.3.1 POLICY  CONTEXT  
Two  sections  of  the  City  of  Toronto's   Official  Plan  (2010a)  provide  policy  guidance  on  the  preservation  of   school  lands.     s.3.2.2.   Community  Services  and  Facilities  expresses   Council's   understanding   that   schools   are  a  source  of  valuable  community  open  spaces.  It  states  that:    

3.  Shared  use  of  multi-service  facilities  will  be  encouraged.  Shared  use  of  municipal  and/or  school   facilities,   places   of   worship   and   lands   for   community   service   purposes   will   be   particularly   encouraged.   The   addition   of   other   uses   on   school   sites,   including   other   community   service   facilities,   residential   units   or   office   space,   is   permitted   provided   all   uses   can   be   adequately   accommodated.   4.   Council   recognizes   that   schools   are   an   integral   community   resource   that   serve   not   only   as   learning  institutions  but  also  as  socio-cultural  centres  and  a  source  of  valuable  community  open   space.   The   City   will   encourage   and   promote   the   shared   use   of   schools,   parks   and   public   open   space.   The   City   will   consider   acquiring   publicly   owned   school   sites,   shown   on   Map   7,   for   parks   and  open  space  purposes  should  they  no  longer  be  needed  as  learning  institutions.  
   Further,  s.3.2.3.1  Parks  and  Open  Spaces,  declares  that:  

Maintaining,  enhancing  and  expanding  the  [parks]  system  requires  the  following  actions:  [...]     (c)  protecting  access  to  existing  publicly  accessible  open  spaces,  as  well  as  expanding  the  system   of   open   spaces   and   developing   open   space   linkages;   and   (d)   promoting   and   using   private   open  

  

19  

  

space  and  recreation  facilities,  including  areas  suitable  for  community  or  allotment  gardening,  to   supplement  the  City's  parks,  facilities  and  amenities.  
   In  November  2013,  City  Council  passed  a  resolution  asking  City  staff  to  look  at  ways  to  save  TDSB  green   open  spaces  and  to  work  with  the  TDSB  to  alter  the  province's  capital  funding  of  schools  "to  ensure  that   when  school  properties  are  an  essential  part  of  the  open  space/network  that  they  are  retained  as  such"   (City   of   Toronto,   2013b,   p3).      On   June   18,   2014,   the   TDSB   agreed   to   a   "partnership"   with   the   City   of   Toronto  regarding  infrastructure  funding  for  school  grounds  (TDSB,  2014):      

[It  was]  resolved  that  the  Director  enter  into  discussions  with  City  of  Toronto  staff  and  appropriate   provincial  government  representatives  to:   1. develop   options   for   generating   sustainable   school   infrastructure   funding,   while   preserving  school  sites  as  important  educational  assets  for  future  generations;   2. ensure  that  playing  fields  and  green  space  are  preserved;   3. generate   funding   to   support   infrastructure   investment   needed   in   Toronto   District   School   Board   schools   to   support   the   City's   Official   Plan   and   significant   population   growth.  
More   recently,   in   February   of   2015   Council   established   a   new   City-School   Boards   Advisory   Committee,   made   up   of   elected   representatives   from   the   City   and   the   School   Boards,   mandated   to   create   better   strategies   that   mitigate   concerns   and   negative   impacts   related   to   the   use   and   disposition   of   school   properties.    It  is  hoped  that  the  Committee  will  develop...    

"a  new  multilateral,  consultative  relationship  for  the  City  of  Toronto,  the  School  Boards  and  the   Province  of  Ontario  with  respect  to  schools  lands  disposition  that:   a)  takes  into  consideration  the  full  value  of  schools  as  community  assets,  in  addition  to  their  value   as  educational  institutions;     b)  provides  a  viable  framework  for  retaining  public  ownership  of  former  school  properties  when   there  is  agreement  among  the  parties  that  the  site  should  be  retained;  and,     c)  identifies  additional  capital  funding  sources  for  school  renewal  in  Toronto."   (City  of  Toronto,  2015b,  p1).      
   Although  the  City-School  Boards  Advisory  Committee  is  an  excellent  step  for  improving  the  City  and  TDSB   relationship,   it   has   not   yet   reported   any   strategies   that   speak   to   the   above   issues.      These   excerpts   demonstrate  that  while  the  TDSB  and  the  City  of  Toronto  are  beginning  to  adjust  policy  to  establish  some   kind   of   partnerships,   these   initiatives   are   still   in   exploratory   stages   and   accordingly   do   not   hold   much   authoritative  power.    The  TDSB  has  been  selling,  and  is  still  considering  the  sale  of,  numerous  properties   or   sections   of   schoolyards   with   little   regard   for   these   budding   partnerships   or   for   the   vital   role   their   schools  play  in  communities.    The  TDSB  and  City  of  Toronto  have  yet  to  implement  strategies  that  change   the   current   approach   of   disposing   school   properties   in   order   for   other   public   entities   to   have   the   opportunity  to  acquire  them  more  easily.

2.3.2 SCHOOLS  AS  COMMUNITY  HUBS  
All   levels   of   government   and   all   community   members   recognize   that   schools   and   their   schoolyards   are   "community   hubs".      As   seen   above   in   section   2.1.2   of   this   paper,   the   City   of   Toronto   Official   Plan   recognizes   that   publically   funded   schools   are   a   community   resource   and   play   a   significant   role   in   Toronto's  neighbourhoods.  The  City  is  promoting  community  hubs  that  provide  childcare,  recreation  and   other  health  and  social  services  to  surrounding  residents  (City  of  Toronto,  2010a).       Over  recent  years,  School  Boards  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  have  completed  a  number  of  reports  and   have  established  a  few  new  programs  that  recognize  and  support  schools  as  community  hubs.    In  2004,   the  Province  provided  school  boards  with  funding  under  the   Community  Use  of  Schools,  a  program  that   makes  school  spaces  more  affordable  for  use  by  community  members,  and  another  program  called  the  

Priority   School   Initiative   that   offers   free   space   for   community   use   in   220   schools   located   in   high-need  
neighbourhoods   across   Ontario   (Johnston,   2009).      However,   funding   for   either   of   these   programs   has   "flat-lined"  or  diminished  over  the  past  few  years  (Ibid).       In   2006,   the   TDSB   and   the   Toronto   Catholic   District   School   Board   (TCDSB)   prepared   a   joint   proposal   entitled  "The  Made  in  Toronto  Solution"  that  recommended  integrating  schools  within  the  community  as   "hubs  for  learning"  through  school  renewal  (TDSB  &  TCDSB,  2006,  p3).  The  recommendations  are  based   upon  a  partnership  between  the  City  of  Toronto  and  the  School  Boards  that  include  permitting  the  use  of   school  facilities  for  community  activities  on  a  broader  basis  and  pooling  their  resources  together  in  order   to   provide   better   multi-purpose   facilities   to   communities   (Ibid).      This   report   is   a   key   document   that   demonstrates   that   both   the   City   and   the   TDSB   have   recognized   that   by   pooling   their   efforts   into   a   formalized  partnership,  schools  can  be  renewed  to  become  so  much  more  than  just  spaces  for  learning.       Although  the  report  sites  this  proposal  as  a  possible  "win-win-win"  solution  between  the  City  of  Toronto,   Schools  Boards,  and  the  Province  (Ibid,  p3),  nothing  has  been  found  that  came  out  of  this  proposal  since   the  report  was  first  released  in  2006.    The  recommended  joint  approach  remains  valid.   Recently  in  2015,  the  Ontario  government  identified  the  establishment  of  Community  Hubs  as  a  priority   action   for   the   development   of   vibrant   neighbourhoods   within   the   province   (Government   of   Ontario,   2015).    The  Provincial  Government  will  be  undertaking  a  review  of  provincial  policies  and  "developing  a   strategic  framework...which  will  include  working  across  sectors  and  through  partnerships,  to  enhance  the   use   of   community   assets"   (Ministry   of   Education,   2015d,   p8).      In   response,   the   Ministry   of   Education   declared   that   it   will   support   this   initiative   by   making   funding   and   other   resources   available   "to   assist  

  

21  

   school  boards  with  retrofitting  and  modifying  facilities  where  a  viable  community  hub  partner  has  been   identified"   (Ministry   of   Education,   2015d,   p8).      Though   no   numbers   or   figures   seem   to   have   been   reported  and  no  formal  programs  or  partnerships  have  been  established  as  of  yet  besides  the  City-School   Boards  Advisory  Committee,  the  strong  written  support  of  all  levels  of  government  could  now  facilitate   the  development  of  a  formal  partnership  between  the  TDSB  and  the  City  to  protect  and  maintain  school   properties  as  community  assets.   However,   the   potential   to   establish   and   expand   community   hubs   will   be   diminished   unless   schools   and   schoolyards   are   fully   evaluated   as   the   public   assets   that   they   are   before   they   are   closed   or   deemed   as   surplus  and  sold.    As  mentioned,  many  schools  provide  more  than  just  a  space  for  education,  particularly   for   vulnerable   neighbourhoods,   and   this   also   holds   true   for   schoolyards   where   community   members   should  be  able  to  access  the  open  spaces  before  and  after  school  hours  and  participate  in  leisure  or  active   recreational  activities.    Yet  even  these  spaces  can  be  defined  as  underutilized  as  many  of  them  offer  few   or  old  amenities  and  little  to  no  green  space  and  therefore  do  not  draw  in  community  members  to  use   the  space.    Thus,  schoolyards  also  have  the  potential  to  contribute  more  to  the  community  than  they  do   currently.    

2.3.3 CURRENT  JOINT  USE  AGREEMENTS  
The   City   and   the   local   school   boards   have   a   history   of   cooperation   and   shared   use   of   schools   for   recreation,   childcare,   family   centres,   and   other   community   uses   ­   for   a   fee.      The   Ministry   of   Education   has   recognized   the   importance   of   schools   to   their   communities   and   the   new   Community   Planning   and  

Partnerships   Guideline   reflects   this   concept.      It   encourages   school   boards   to   focus   on   sharing   facilities  
with  community  partners  and  establish  effective  planning  with  community  partners,  including  decisions   about   underutilized   space   (Ministry   of   Education,   2015c).      Likewise,   the   TDSB   recognizes   that   neighbourhood  schools  are  hubs  of  the  community  and  therefore  they  must  ensure  that  school  space  is   accessible  and  affordable.    Organizations  and  agencies,  and  community  groups  may  acquire  a  permit  from   the  TDSB  to  use  their  classrooms,  gyms,  auditoriums,  sports  fields  and  other  spaces  throughout  the  year   when  they  are  not  being  used  for  school  activities  (TDSB,  2013).    The  TDSB  also  has  66  pools  in  its  schools   that  can  be  used  by  the  community  after  school  hours;  31  are  managed  by  the  TLC  and  33  are  managed   by   the   City's   PF&R   Division   (City   of   Toronto,   2012b).      The   TLC   was   assigned   these   pools   in   2008   as   the   TDSB  could  no  longer  fund  these  pools  and  was  considering  closing  them  (Ibid).      

  

22  

   The   City's   use   of   the   TDSB   pools   is   governed   by   an   agreement   first   developed   in   2003,   where   the   City   funds  and  provides  community  swimming  opportunities  after  school  hours,  on  weekends,  and  all  summer   (Ibid).    In  addition,  there  are  currently  172  different  school  board  facilities  that  are  used  by  the  City  and   they  are  secured  through  a  variety  of  agreements  (Ibid).    For  example,  through  a  "shared  use  agreement"   with  the  TDSB,  the  City  leases  school  board  facilities  and  pays  per  square  foot  so  that  PF&R  can  use  some   schools  for  City  programs  (City  of  Toronto,  2014b).    In  2013,  the  City  spent  $14.805  million  to  use  TDSB   space   for   PF&R   and   Children's   Services   programs,   of   which   $0.675   million   is   for   "Exclusive   Use"   space   under  negotiation  such  as  community  recreation  offices  (Ibid).       All  of  these  policies  that  support  joint  use  agreements  and  community  use  of  school  space  demonstrate   that   there   are   already   active   partnerships   between   the   City   and   the   TDSB.      Therefore   it   is   possible   to   direct   these   alliances   into   more   formal,   long-standing   policy-based   collaborations   for   protecting   and   revitalizing  schoolyards.  

2.3.4 SCHOOL  LANDS  PROPERTY  ACQUISITION  FRAMEWORK  
Critics   of   closures   often   fear   the   loss   of   school   properties   as   the   loss   of   public   assets.   For   example,   Clandfield   and   Martell   argue   that   under   the   current   neoliberal   policy   regime,   school   sites   are   "just   property,   a   disposable   public   asset,   and   a   potential   public   liability   if   they   do   not   yield   a   return   on   their   investment"  (2010,  p11).    However,  critics  of  school  closures  do  not  propose  strategies  for  cash-strapped   municipalities   to   acquire   such   properties   (Rasanu,   2012),   and   thus   the   literature   to   date   is   of   limited   utility  in  identifying  precedents  or  solutions  for  school  acquisition  policies.   Toronto   City   Council   adopted   the   School   Lands   Acquisition   Framework   to   identify   and   prioritize   properties   that   become   available   for   sale   by   local   school   boards   (City   of   Toronto,   2010b).      This   was   in   response  to  the  provincially  mandated  disposition  process  that  school  boards  must  follow.    After  a  school   is   declared   surplus,   under   Regulation   444/98   of   the   Education   Act,   it   is   required   that   these   schools   are   first   offered   to   school   boards   and   other   public   entities   for   purchase   or   lease   (Ibid).      If   no   offer   is   submitted  or  agreed  upon  by  the  entities  within  90  days,  the  property  is  then  disposed  of  on  the  open   market.    This  process  is  challenging  for  public  entities  in  two  major  ways:  firstly,  the  TDSB/TLC  offer  the   school  lands  at  "fair  market  value",  prices  that  the  cash-strapped  City  or  other  public  agencies  can  hardly   meet;   and   secondly,   the   90   day   circulation   period   is   not   enough   time   for   public   agencies   to   cobble   together  huge  sums  of  money  (Ibid;  City  of  Toronto,  2015b).    As  land  prices  keep  increasing  in  the  City  of   Toronto,  it  will  become  even  harder  for  public  entities  to  compete  with  deep-pocketed  developers.    

  

23  

   When  PF&R  staff  receive  notice  of  surplus  schools  being  sold,  they  evaluate  the  school  sites  on  a  case-by- case  basis  for  suitability  for  acquisition.    One  of  the  key  assessment  tools  is  a  measurement  of  the  amount   of   local   parkland   per   1,000   persons   relative   to   other   parts   of   the   city   (City   of   Toronto,   2014a).   Other   assessment   criteria   include   proximity   to   other   parkland,   recent   residential   growth,   natural   heritage   significance,   and   available   acquisition   funding   (Ibid).      Leading   parks   advocates   (such   as   Harnik,   2010;   Garvin,  2011;  Evergreen,  2004)  tend  to  agree  that  there  is  no  one-size-fits-all  solution  or  standard  of  ideal   service  provision  rates,  making  the  task  of  determining  which  school  lands  the  City  should  acquire  on  a   limited  budget  even  more  difficult.  

2.4 SHARED  INTERESTS,  DIFFERING  PRIORITIES  
In   light   of   the   policy   statements   and   joint   use   agreements,   it   is   clear   that   the   TDSB,   the   Ministry   of   Education,  and  the  City  of  Toronto  have  similar  interests  in  preserving  and  encouraging  the  use  of  schools   as  community  hubs,  but  at  the  same  time  they  have  differing  priorities  that  affect  this  ambition.    These   interests  and  priorities  were  summarized  in  the  "Made  in  Toronto  Solution"  Report  (TDSB  &  TCDSB,  2006,   p9)  and  are  outlined  below:

Expand  newer  school  buildings  that  are  serving  a  growing  student  population.   In  recognition  of  these  needs,  the  school  boards  have  a  number  of  joint  ventures   under  way,  which  depend  on  the  provincial  funding  model  to  provide  cash  flow.   The  School  Boards  have  some  surplus  facilities  that  are  not  appropriate  for  use  by   students,  and  which  may  be  suitable  for  disposition  or  for  other  public  sector  uses.

Interests  of   the  City  of   Toronto   

·    The  City's  Interests  as  outlined  by  City  Staff  in  their  March  10,  2015  Staff  Report  (2015b,   p1):   · Schools  as  spaces  for  child  care  and  early  learning   · School  lands  as  green  space   · Schools  as  sites  for  non-educational  services  and  programming   · Schools  to  serve  growth  areas  

Preserve  existing  schools  so  that  the  fields  can  be  used  as  green  or  recreational   space  and  the  buildings  used  to  house  community  and  social  services.   Preserve  publicly  funded  schools  operating  in  existing  neighbourhoods  as  learning   institutions  for  local  residents  and  access  points  for  other  community  services.   Prevent  re-development  of  surplus  school  sites.  

Table  3:  Breakdown  of  interests  regarding  school  properties  between  the  Ministry  of  Education,   School  Boards,  and  City  of  Toronto  (TDSB  &  TCDSB,  2006,  p9)  

The  report  speaks  to  the  development  of  a  "multilateral"  policy  approach  to  maintain  public  assets  and   finance  the  capital  renewal  of  schools,  and  its  directives  have  now  been  passed  down  to  the  City-School   Boards  Advisory  Committee  to  find  this  elusive  "solution"  (TDSB  &  TCDSB,  2006).    While  the  goals  of  all   levels  of  governments  are  clear,  the  means  of  achieving  them  are  not.    The  City  does  not  discourage  the   closure   of   schools   altogether   and   recognizes   that   some   schools   may   not   represent   a   significant  

  

25  

   community  asset.    However,  the  City  does  maintain  that  certain  processes  of  school  disposition  should  be   amended   (City   of   Toronto,   2015b).      As   discussed,   the   Ministry's   funding   formula   for   school   boards   is   based   on   student   enrolment   and   accordingly,   the   financial   support   for   TDSB   schools   has   significantly   diminished   since   the   Ministry   identified   that   the   Board   was   holding   in   its   possession   a   large   number   of   underutilized   schools.      This   has   forced   the   TDSB   to   begin   reviewing   each   of   these   schools   for   possible   closure  in  order  to  pay  for  its  backlog  of  maintenance  and  large  deficit.       The  TDSB's  "Pupil  Accommodation  Review"  that  is  used  to  determine  if  a  school  should  be  disposed  of  is   based  on  the  assessment  of  a  school's  usefulness  by  the  number  of  students  enrolled  while  also  taking   into   consideration   program   viability   and   the   physical   condition   of   the   school   (City   of   Toronto,   2015b).     The   accommodation   review   takes   into   consideration   the   value   of   the   school   to   the   community   as   the   third  and  second  last  criteria  for  evaluation,  but  the  program  emphasizes  that  the  school's  value  to  the   student   takes   priority   over   any   other   considerations   (Ministry   of   Education,   2009).      The   funding   formula/GSN   on   the   other   hand   does   not   at   all   consider   the   value   of   schools   and   schoolyards   to   community  members  outside  of  its  educational  use  (City  of  Toronto,  2014a).    Even  though  the  TDSB  and   the   Ministry   recognize   a   school's   importance   as   a   community   resource,   the   current   process   of   school   disposition  "impedes  integrated  strategic  planning,  partnership  development  and  collaborative  efforts  to   retain  school  board  lands  as  vital  public  assets.    It  also  undermines  the  objectives  of  the  Official  Plan,  local   service   delivery   and   place-based   planning"   (City   of   Toronto,   2010b,   p4).      Once   schools   are   deemed   surplus,   the   procedure   followed   by   the   TDSB   largely   leaves   the   interests   of   the   City   and   other   public   entities  out  of  the  picture  since  it  does  not  favour  these  groups  who  would  seek  to  keep  these  properties   for  the  benefit  of  the  community  (City  of  Toronto,  2015b).   While  it  is  clear  that  the  TDSB  and  the  City  have  begun  efforts  to  align  their  actions  to  serve  their  shared   interests,  in  difficult  situations  that  requires  the  TDSB  to  sell  their  properties,  the  Board  is  still  resorting  to   pointing  to  their  sole  legislative  role  as  a  provider  of  education.    At  a  recent  community  consultation  in   the  winter  of  2015  where  a  TDSB  schoolyard  was  subdivided  as  part  of  it  was  deemed  "surplus",  the  TLC   reiterated  the  clear  distinctions  of  roles  and  responsibilities  between  the  City  and  the  TDSB;  the  TDSB's   sole  role  is  to  provide  educational  services  to  school  age  children  and  they  are  not  mandated  to  create   public  parkland  under  any  legislation  (TLC,  2015).    Community  members  may  only  use  schoolyards  at  the   discretion   of   the   School   Board   and   it   is   the   City's   responsibility   to   provide   and   manage   parkland   (Ibid).     Unfortunately,  legislative  distinctions  of  who  owns  and  maintains  certain  public  green  spaces  mean  little   to  community  members  whose  primary  concern  is  having  access  to  public  amenities.    The  City  argues  that

   "[t]he   debate   over   school   closures   ("no   school   should   be   sold"   versus   "all   educationally   underutilized   schools  should  be  sold")  needs  to  be  replaced  with  a  nuanced  conversation  about  the  diverse  roles  that   schools  may  play  in  communities,  and  the  complementary  roles  for  governments  and  other  stakeholders   in   supporting   and   maintaining   these   facilities   in   the   public   realm"   (City   of   Toronto,   2015b,   p10).       Therefore,  not  only  do  the  interests  and  the  actions  of  all  three  government  bodies  need  to  be  aligned,   but   their   roles   as   providers   must   also   be   modified   so   that   they   can   share   in   the   responsibilities   of   providing  services  for  the  greater  good  of  the  public.

3.1 BENEFITS  OF  GREEN  SPACE  
Urban   forests   and   parklands   have   been   found   to   provide   many   health,   environmental   and   economic   benefits   to   surrounding   communities.   Turning   schoolyards   into   greener   community   spaces   can   be   an   invaluable  tool  to  increase  these  positive  impacts  for  students,  the  community,  and  City  at  large.  

3.1.1 ENVIRONMENTAL  
"Public   parks   and   [green   spaces]   play   a   critical   role   in   supporting   biodiversity   and   providing   important   ecosystem   services   in   urban   areas"   (Barbosa   et   al.,   2007,   p1).      These   natural   ecosystems   serve   many   functions   including   food   production   for   animals,   insects   and   humans,   erosion   control,   cleaner   water   as   roots   trap   contaminants   before   they   flow   into   water   supplies,   and   cleaner   air   as   trees   and   other   vegetation   filter   out   pollutants   and   produce   oxygen   (Bolund   &   Hunhammar,   1999).      In   addition,   green   spaces  also  provide  other  services  that  mitigate  the  negative,  physical  effects  of  urban  environments  such   as   reducing   storm   water   runoff,   reducing   energy   costs   through   shade,   minimizing   the   urban   heating   island   effect   by   replacing   asphalt   with   natural   vegetation   cover,   and   improving   aesthetics   (McAuslan,   2007).      School   properties   and   open   public   space   surfaces   are   particularly   hot   places   and   have   been   described   as   "heat   islands,   areas   of   higher   temperature   than   the   surrounding   landscape"   due   to   the   material  composition  of  their  surfaces  (Moogk-Soulis,  2010).    Schoolyards  are  most  commonly  comprised   of   asphalt,   steel,   tar   and   chip   roofs,   and   mowed   turf,   and   these   are   some   of   the   most   heat-absorbent   materials  used  in  urban  environments  (Ibid).    Through  various  studies  it  has  been  found  that  the  shade   provided  by  trees  is  a  simple  yet  very  effective  heat  mitigation  strategy  (Ibid;  Akbari,  Pomerantz  &  Taha,   2001;  Rosenzweig  et  al.,  2006).        

3.1.2 HEALTH  
Public  parks  are  often  the  only  contact  and  interaction  many  people  have  with  the  natural  environment   and  thus  it  is  argued  that  urban  green  spaces  can  have  a  profound  affect  on  the  mental  and  physical  well- being   of   people   (Barbosa   et   al.,   2007).      People   increasingly   spend   more   time   indoors   and   are   less   physically  inactive  due  to  work,  stress,  attachment  to  technology,  and  dependency  on  cars  (Bedimo-Rung   et  al.,  2005).    This  sedentary  lifestyle  has  been  linked  to  a  number  of  physical  and  mental  health  diseases   such  as  obesity,  type  2  diabetes,  depression  and  mental  fatigue  (Stigsdotter  et  al.,  2010).    Contact  with   nature   has   been   found   to   positively   impact   physical   and   mental   well-being   (Stigsdotter   et   al.,   2010;  

  

28  

   Morris,   2003;   Kessel,   2008).      Researchers   from   a   wide   range   of   disciplines   have   suggested   that   urban   green   spaces   improve   mental   functioning,   mental   health   and   well-being   (Taylor,   Kuo   &   Sullivan,   2001;   Karp,  Paillard-Borg,  Wang  et  al.,  2006),  and  serve  as  a  resource  for  physical  activities,  which  subsequently   has  been  shown  to  reduce  diseases  such  as  diabetes,  heart  disease,  osteoporosis  and  fall-related  injuries   (Kahn,   Ramsey,   Brownson   et   al.,   2002;   Stigsdotter   et   al.,   2010).      In   addition,   studies   have   shown   that   exposure   to   natural   features   reduces   stress   and   promotes   relaxation   (White,   Alcock,   Wheeler,   &   Depledge,  2013;  Bowler,  Buyung-Ali,  Knight,  &  Pullin,  2010).  

3.1.3 ECONOMIC  
Trees  have  been  described  as  "the  only  capital  expenditure  that  increase  in  value  and  effectiveness  over   time"  (Moogk-Soulis,  2002,  p16)  and  consequently  public  parks  have  been  proven  to  provide  economic   value   to   urban   areas   in   a   number   of   ways   including   property   values,   tourism,   health,   business   vitality,   clean  water,  clean  air  and  relief  from  traffic  and  noise  (Harnik,  2006;  Fausold  &  Lilieholm,  1999).  Green   spaces   can   provide   a   city   with   two   direct   sources   of   income:   (1)   an   increase   in   property   value   and   consequently  an  increase  in  property  taxes  due  to  a  property's  close  proximity  to  an  aesthetically  pleasing   natural  amenity,  and  (2)  an  increase  in  sales  taxes  as  parks  can  draw  visitors  and  tourists  (Harnik  &  Welle,   2009).      Green   spaces   can   also   provide   direct   savings   to   cities   and   residents   by   (1)   providing   free   recreational  space,  (2)  mitigating  negative  health  issues  and  consequently  providing  savings  in  healthcare   costs,  (3)  providing  energy  savings  through  shading,  and  (4)  managing  stormwater  runoff  (Harnik  &  Welle,   2009;  Alexander  &  McDonald,  2013).  

3.1.4 ACCESSIBILITY  &  QUALITY  
Residential  proximity  to  parks  has  proven  to  be  a  critical  determinant  of  park  use  and  amount  of  leisure   exercise   for   children   and   adults;   people   who   have   good   access   to   green   space   are   more   likely   to   use   it   (Cohen  et  al.,  2006;  Kaczynski  &  Henderson,  2007;  Lee  &  Moudon,  2008)  and  people  who  regularly  use   parks  get  more  exercise  than  people  who  do  not  (Cohen  et  al.,  2007;  Giles-Corti  et  al.,  2005).    There  is   also   a   relationship   between   the   distance   from   one's   home   to   the   nearest   green   space   and   health;   the   further  the  distance  is  from  one's  home  to  the  greenest  green  space,  the  more  stress  they  are  likely  to   experience   (Stigsdotter   et   al.,   2010).      Furthermore,   the   quality   and   conditions   of   parks   is   an   equally   important  factor  of  park  use.    Parks  and  other  green  spaces  are  a  focal  point  of  any  neighbourhood  and   they  provide  a  window  into  the  characteristics  and  demographics  of  a  surrounding  community:  

A  schoolyard  is  a  school's  `external  environment',  whether  large  or  small,  beautiful  or  unsightly,   actively   used   or   completely   abandoned.   Whatever   its   condition,   a   schoolyard   is   an   indicator   of  

  

29  

  

the   health   of   the   surrounding   community,   and   each   has   a   powerful   impact   on   the   other.   An   unimproved   or   degraded   schoolyard   sends   a   negative   message   about   the   school   and   the   neighborhood   in   which   it   is   situated.      A   dynamic   and   active   schoolyard   adds   to   the   vibrancy   of   both.    (Menino,  2000,  p11).  
   Research  has  shown  that  the  more  aesthetically  pleasing  a  park  is,  the  more  likely  people  are  going  to  use   it  (Kondo  et  al.,  2009);  larger  parks  with  more  facilities  and  amenities,  and  parks  that  are  well  maintained   are   considered   to   be   more   attractive   and   have   greater   appeal   to   the   community   (Kessel   et   al.,   2009;   Giles-Corti  et  al.,  2005).    Conversely,  fewer  facilities  and  poorer  conditions  have  a  negative  impact  on  the   use  of  green  spaces,  as  places  in  disrepair  are  less  likely  to  be  visited  and  contribute  to  a  perceived  sense   of  a  lack  of  safety  (Kessel  et  al.,  2009).  

3.2 GREENING  SCHOOLYARDS  
Schoolyard  greening  is  not  a  new  concept  as  by  1996  there  were  more  than  40  organizations  devoted  to   sponsoring  or  implementing  schoolyard  greening  programs  across  the  United  State  (Rivkin,  1997).    Most   of   these   projects   have   been,   and   currently   are,   of   local   or   state   scope,   but   in   Canada   the   schoolyard   greening   initiatives   that   have   been   found   are   on   a   site-by-site   basis.      Public   schoolyards   are   in   essence   publically  owned,  which  means  they  should  be  one  of  the  easier  spaces  to  revitalize  for  the  public.  They   are  properties  that  do  not  necessarily  need  to  be  acquired  in  order  for  them  to  be  added  to  a  city's  green   space  network.   In   addition   to   all   of   the   benefits   of   green   space   that   have   been   cited   above,   there   are   a   number   of   reasons   as   to   why   greening   a   schoolyard   is   particularly   important   for   schools   and   their   students.     Schoolyards   and   their   facilities/amenities   can   be   used   as   a   tool   and   as   a   space   to   teach   while   simultaneously  promoting  cognitive  and  social  development  in  children.      

3.2.1 EDUCATIONAL  BENEFITS  
Schools   are   educational   spaces   by   definition   and   few   actions   would   re-enforce   this   mission   more   than   providing   the   opportunity   for   learning   to   permeate   into   the   natural   environment   as   supported   by   environmental   education   (Tooke,   2011).      Studies   have   shown   that   a   positive   relationship   between   outdoor   cirrucula   in   naturalized   environments   and   learning   exists;   children   with   outdoor   classroom   curricula  demonstrated  an  increased  ability  to  think  creatively  and  critically,  and  they  performed  better   on   standardized   academic   tests   in   various   subjects   if   lessons   were   integrated   into   outdoor   curricula   (Ballantyne   &   Packer,   2002;   Lieberman   &   Hoody,   2000;   Dyment   &   Reid,   2005).      Moreover,   it   has   been  

  

30  

   found  that  children  who  had  more  contact  with  nature  scored  higher  on  tests  of  concentration  and  self- discipline--the  greener,  the  better  the  scores  (Wells,  2000).    It  was  also  indicated  that  teaching  in  natural   learning  environments  or  outdoor  classrooms  provided  benefits  that  extended  past  the  curriculum  such   as   reducing   student   behavioural   issues   and   discipline   problems,   increasing   student   collaboration,   teachers  reviving  their  passion  for  learning  and  teaching,  and  improving  interactions  among  students  and   teachers  (Dyment  &  Reid,  2005;  Boston  Education  Development  Center,  2000).  

3.2.2 DEVELOPMENTAL  BENEFITS  
Recent   research   shows   that   the   natural   environment   has   profound   effects   on   adults   and   in   particular   children,  as  it  hugely  and  positively  impacts  a  child's  physical  and  psychological  well-being  that  cannot  be   replicated   in   any   other   setting   (White,   2004;   Wells   &   Evans,   2003).      For   example,   it   was   found   that   children  who  lived  near  nature  had  lower  levels  of  behavioural  issues,  anxiety  and  depression,  indicating   they   were   more   psychologically   at   ease   and   happier   than   their   peers   with   homes   farther   away   from   nature   (Wells   and   Evans,   2003).      Naturalized   schoolyards   support   a   child's   cognitive   development   as   it   provides  a  variety  of  materials  that  engage  all  the  senses  ­  sight,  touch,  taste,  smell,  and  hearing  (Rivkin,   1997).    Furthermore,  children  with  symptoms  of  ADHD  are  better  able  to  concentrate  after  contact  with   nature   (Faber   Taylor   et   al.   2001),   and   children   who   play   regularly   in   natural   environments   are   much   healthier,  show  better  coordination,  balance  and  agility,  and  are  sick  less  often  (Fjortoft,  2001).     Studies   have   also   observed   that   children   who   learn   and   play   in   green   spaces   engage   more   in   creative   forms  of  play  than  in  built  spaces  (Faber  Taylor  &  Kuo,  2006).    This  can  be  associated  with  the  importance   of   risk   and   challenge   in   a   natural   landscape   (Ball,   Gill   &   Spiegal,   2008),   as   children   need   to   have   opportunities   to   test   their   limits   through   play,   and   to   ultimately   grow   in   a   way   that   develops   "good   judgment,  persistence,  courage,  resiliency,  and  self-confidence"  (Finch,  2012,  p2).    

3.2.3 SCHOOL  GREENING  INITIATIVES  IN  TORONTO  
Although  the  TDSB  and  the  City  of  Toronto  currently  do  not  have  a  citywide  school  greening  initiative,  the   TDSB  has  made  some  efforts  to  implement  school  greening  initiatives  on  a  more  site-to-site  basis.    The   EcoSchools   program   was   developed   by   the   TDSB   "to   make   environmental   awareness   and   action   an   integral  part  of  everyday  school  life"  (TDSB,  2015).    The  program  focuses  on  waste  minimization,  energy   conservation,  school  ground  greening,  and  ecological  literacy  and  assists  schools  with  implementing  these   measures   by   guiding   staff   and   students   on   how   to   run   schools   in   a   more   sustainable   manner   (Ibid).     Schools  who  would  like  to  be  a  part  of  this  program  are  required  to  have  an  "EcoTeam"  and  action  plan  as  

  

31  

   part   of   their   application   to   register   and   receive   "Ecoschool   Certification"   (Ibid).      All   schools,   new   and   returning,  must  apply  to  register  every  year.    There  are  five  certification  guides  that  schools  can  use  to   assist   in   the   application   process   and   a   number   of   other   guides   for   implementing   waste   management,   school   ground   greening,   and   building   community   capacity.      While   all   of   these   resources   reflect   an   organized   and   committed   program,   they   also   suggest   a   rather   arduous   process   for   yearly   certification.     Furthermore,  a  school  community  collectively  decides  whether  it  wants  to  be  a  part  of  this  program  and   then  takes  the  initiative  to  apply,  indicating  that  those  schools  who  apply  have  the  capacity  and  resources   to  do  so.    This  process  thus  may  leave  out  schools  with  vulnerable  communities  as  they  are  more  likely  to   not   have   the   resources   to   apply,   yet   on   the   other   hand   such   schools   are   more   likely   to   need   such   a   program.   Another  school  greening  initiative  that  has  been  established  for  some  time  now  is  the  Toyota  Evergreen   Learning  Grounds  program.    Since  its  establishment  in  1991,  the  program  has  helped  over  3,000  schools   across   Canada   green   their   schoolyards   and   it   has   also   developed   a   number   of   guides   for   designing,   implementing  and  managing  green  schoolyards,  as  well  as  a  number  of  research  reports  and  policy  briefs   on  the  topic's  importance  (Evergreen,  2015).    Schools  must  apply  to  the  program  for  funding  grants  and   they   can   be   offered   up   to   $3,500   (Ibid).      However,   grants   are   limited   and   the   program,   along   with   the   individual   schools   rely   on   donations   from   the   public,   foundations,   and   businesses.      In   2013,   Evergreen   partnered  with  the  TDSB  to  create  a  design  guide  called  the  "Landscape  and  Child  Development:  A  Design   Guide   for   Early   Years-Kindergarten   Play-Learning   Environments".      This   resource   provides   guidelines   for   schools  to  design  outdoor  play  spaces  that  meet  the  developmental  needs  of  young  children  (Evergreen   &  TDSB,  2013).      While  this  program  and  its  guidelines  have  been  valuable  to  many  schools  across  Canada,   the  lack  of  consolidated  efforts  across  an  entire  district  forces  individual  schools  who  wish  to  be  greened   to  work  in  isolation.    This  individualized  and  site-by-site  effort  does  not  allow  for  an  equitable  approach  to   greening  schoolyards,  and  again,  the  schools  that  need  to  be  revitalized  the  most  are  more  likely  to  not   have  the  resources  to  do  so.  

3.3 GAPS  IN  THE  RESEARCH  
While   there   is   much   evidence   that   shows   the   numerous   benefits   of   green   space,   there   is   no   standard   method   among   Canadian   municipalities   for   defining   green   space   in   their   jurisdiction   (Evergreen,   2004).     For   example,   some   municipalities   may   include   cemeteries   or   natural   reserves   or   they   will   not   include   areas  owned  by  conservation  authorizes.    This  makes  the  task  of  identifying  trends  in  urban  green  space  

  

32  

   inventories,   and   making   comparisons   among   municipalities,   particularly   difficult   (Ibid).      Further,   municipalities  tend  to  limit  parkland  standards  to  a  measurement  of  acres  per  1,000  people  or  proximity   to  parks  using  buffers  ranging  from  250-500  metres  to  represent  a  certain  amount  of  walking  distance.      

"While   green   space   amount   and   proximity   to   residents   are   important   concerns,   these   traditional   standards  do  not  take  into  account  other  factors  such  as:   · quality  of  landscape  design;   · ecological  health  and  biodiversity;   · appropriateness  of  design  for  diverse  users  and  activities;   · interpretive  and  educational  programming;  and   · amount  of  green  space  in  the  surrounding  region.   Although  these  issues  are  often  addressed  in  other  municipal  planning  and  strategy  documents,   or   on   a   case-by-case   basis   for   individual   parks,   they   are   generally   not   consolidated   into   an   overarching  system  by  which  municipalities  can  evaluate  progress  and  assess  needs"     (Evergreen,  2004,  p9).  
   Overall,  the  City  of  Toronto  lacks  park  policy  that  consolidates  standards  of  the  above-mentioned  factors.   In   order   to   meet   the   needs   of   a   particular   community,   some   park   planning   should   understandably   be   done   on   a   site-by-site   basis.      However,   the   absence   of   standards   that   speak   to   quality,   biodiversity,   programming,   size,   and   access   to   green   space   in   any   area   gives   municipalities   like   the   City   of   Toronto   leeway  to  not  attain  park  goals  that  ensure  all  of  its  residents  are  adequately  served  by  park  space  that   meet  their  needs.    Revitalizing  schoolyards  could  provide  the  City  with  the  opportunity  to  improve  quality,   amount,   and   access   to   parks   through   a   citywide   initiative   that   could   set   goals,   evaluate   process,   and   assess   needs   for   parks   and   their   communities.      This   paper   will   provide   the   City   of   Toronto   with   a   preliminary  analysis  of  if  and  how  schoolyards  could  provide  additional  park  space  to  Torontonians,  and  it   will   provide   case   study   examples   of   citywide   initiatives   that   have   successfully   met   their   park   goals   by   converting  schoolyards  into  schoolyard  parks.

4 METHODOLOGY  
This   research   paper   used   two   methods   of   analysis   to   answer   the   overarching   research   question;   will  

converting   schoolyards   into   schoolyard   parks   increase   access   to   green   space   in   Toronto?      The   first  
method   used   spatial   analysis   to   map   the   geography   of   schoolyards   in   the   TDSB.      The   second   method   completed   a   comprehensive   review   of   schoolyard-to-park   initiatives   that   have   been   established   in   different  cities  across  the  United  States  in  an  effort  to  provide  more  green  space  for  their  citizens.  

4.1 GEOGRAPHIC  INFORMATION  SYSTEM  MAPPING  
This  paper,  from  a  geographic  perspective,  first  encompassed  the  City  of  Toronto  as  a  whole,  and  then  it   looked   at   areas   of   the   City   where   parkland   is   needed   most.         These   priority   areas   are   identified   as   Neighbourhood   Improvements   Areas   ­   neighbourhoods   that   have   a   low   "equity   score"   based   on   15   criteria   that   includes   health,   economics,   political   participation   and   education   ­   and   "low   parkland   provision  areas"  as  defined  by  the  spatial  analysis  completed  by  PF&R  in   Figure  3.    Only  Toronto  District   School  Board  properties  ­  both  elementary  and  secondary  ­  were  used  in  this  spatial  analysis.   In  order  to  inform  a  strategy  to  increase  green  space  in  the  City  by  turning  schoolyards  into  schoolyard   parks,  a  spatial  inventory  of  schoolyards  was  completed.    This  analysis  will  answer  the  following  research   questions:   1. How  much  total  parkland  would  be  added  if:   a. All  TDSB  schoolyards  were  converted  and  added  to  parkland  system?   b. If  only  underutilized  schoolyards  were  converted  and  added  to  the  system?   2. How  many  people  would  benefit  from  the  increase  in  access  to  green  space?      Using  the  program  ArcMap  10.3.1,  the  "Toronto  District  School  Board  Locations"  shapefile  data  set  from   the  City  of  Toronto's  Open  Data  Catalogue  was  used  to  plot  the  locations  of  all  of  the  TDSB's  elementary   and   secondary   schools   on   a   map.      The   size   of   each   school   site   was   then   determined   using   the   Teranet   data  set  shapefile  called  "Toronto  Assessment  2012"  that  contained  all  of  the  site  areas  of  each  property   in  the  City  in  metres  squared.    The  select  by  location  function  was  then  used  to  identify  lot  boundaries   from  the  Teranet  data  shapefile  that  intersected  with  the  TDSB  school  board  points.    This  created  a  third   data  set  layer  that  had  only  the  location  and  areas  of  TDSB  school  properties.    Out  of  585  TDSB  schools   that  were  within  the  TDSB  data  set,  only  533  TDSB  schools  were  located  on  a  parcel  of  property  and  so   these  533  properties  were  used  to  calculate  the  areas  of  the  TDSB  schools.      

  

34  

   This   step   was   repeated   for   the   locations   of   the   TDSB   schools   that   were   declared   "underutilized"   on   January   28,   2015   by   the   TDSB.      Using   the   list   provided   by   the   Globe   and   Mail   of   these   underutilized   schools,   the   names/data   of   the   underutilized   school   sites   were   selected   in   the   attribute   table   of   the   "TDSB  Locations"  data  set,  and  then  exported  into  another  layer.    Then,  using  the  same  process  above,   the   areas   of   the   underutilized   school   properties   were   determined   by   using   the   "Toronto   Assessment   2012"  data  set.    Only  122  underutilized  school  locations  were  located  using  the  TDSB  data  set  available   and   only   the   total   areas   for   118   of   these   underutilized   schools   were   found   and   mapped.      These   118   underutilized  properties  were  used  to  calculate  the  areas  of  the  underutilized  TDSB  schools.         The  data  provided  by  "Toronto  Assessment  2012"  gave  only  the  total  area  of  every  school  property  and   there  was  no  data  set  available  that  measured  only  the  area  of  the  schoolyards/green  space  or  building   footprints   of   TDSB   schools.      In   order   to   use   a   number   that   more   closely   represented   the   area   of   a   schoolyard  rather  than  using  the  total  area  of  a  school  property,  12  randomly  selected  TDSB  schools  were   taken  from  all  over  the  City  of  Toronto.    Using  the  measuring  tool  on  ArcGIS  Online  and  the  aerial  imagery   basemap  that  the  program  provided,  the  total  area  of  each  school  property  was  measured  followed  by   the   total   area   of   each   school   building.   (N.B.   the   area   measurements   for   total   property   area,   school  

building   area,   and   school   green   space   area   were   all   approximations).      The   area   of   each   school   building  
was  then  subtracted  from  the  total  area  of  the  school  property.    The  result  was  an  approximation  of  the   total   area   of   green   space   for   each   property   (these   calculations   are   outlined   in   Table   4   in   section   5.1.1   School  Property  Composition  of  this  paper).   Two   other   data   sets   were   downloaded   from   the   City's   Open   Data   Catalogue,   the   "Neighbourhood   Improvement  Areas"  (NIA)  shapefile  and  the  "Parks"  shapefile,  in  order  to  see  where  all  the  TDSB  schools   were  located  in  relation  to  each  of  these  identified  areas.    Toronto's  "Total  Population  By  Dissemination   Area  for  Census  2011"  was  also  layered  onto  the  map  using  a  shapefile  exported  from  Simply  Map.           Buffers  of  400  metres  were  then  created  around  all  underutilized  TDSB  schools  to  represent  the  standard   of   a   5   to   10-minute   walk   used   by   other   municipalities   in   their   park   standards.   Following   this,   using   the   "select  by  location"  tool,  the  buffer  layer  and  the  census  population  layer  were  selected  to  analyze  the   number   of   people   that   would   fall   within   this   buffer.      It   is   important   to   note   that   for   this   step,   only   dissemination   areas   that   had   their   centroids   located   within   the   buffers   were   taken   into   account.      The   second   option   that   was   not   used   was   to   take   into   account   any   dissemination   area   that   touched   or   fell   within  a  buffer.    This  option  took  into  account  entire  portions  of  dissemination  areas  that  fell  outside  of  

  

35  

   the  buffer  and  therefore  skewed  the  data  much  more  (see  APPENDIX  A  for  a  comparison  of  options).    By   using  the  first  option  where  only  the  dissemination  areas  that  had  their  centroids  located  within  buffers,  a   slightly  more  accurate  representation  of  the  number  of  people  living  within  the  buffers  was  obtained.   Lastly,   since   there   is   currently   no   publically   available   data   on   Toronto's   parkland   provision,   the   "Local   Parkland  Provision  -  Map  8"  from  the  City  of  Toronto's  Official  Plan  (2010a)  was  georeferenced  to  create   a  base  map  on  top  of  which  the  locations  of  the  underutilized  schools  could  be  mapped.    This  was  done  to   illustrate  where  the  underutilized  schools  are  located  in  reference  to  areas  in  Toronto  that  have  a  low  or   high  parkland  provision.      

4.2 PROGRAM  REVIEW  
The  second  component  of  analysis  of  this  paper  is  a  comprehensive  review  of  policy-based  initiatives  that   have  been  implemented  across  four  cities  in  the  United  States  in  an  effort  to  provide  more  green  space  to   their  residents.    The  purpose  of  this  comprehensive  review  is  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  frameworks   of  these  initiatives  in  order  to  potentially  apply  aspects  of  their  frameworks  to  a  program  that  is  unique  to   Toronto.    This  analysis  will  answer  the  third  research  question:   How  do  initiatives  in  other  municipalities  

or  jurisdictions  green  schoolyards  and  incorporate  them  into  their  park  systems?  
The   four   cities   and   their   programs   that   were   reviewed   are   Boston,   New   York,   Denver,   and   Houston.     These  four  cities  were  chosen  through  an  initial  sweep  of  many  different  initiatives  that  were  mentioned   in   Harnik's   2011   article   "Learning   to   Share:   Designing   Schoolyards   for   More   Than   Just   Recess".      These   initiatives  were  then  reviewed  in  greater  detail  as  they  had  the  most  publically  available  information  and   research  found  online.    The  review  examined  each  program  using  four  indicators  that  would  help  the  City   of  Toronto  and  TDSB  understand  the  frameworks  of  each  initiative:     1. When  was  it  established  and  why?   2. What  kind  of  partnership  framework  does  it  follow?  (this  includes  frameworks  for  funding,   implementation/process  of  the  program,  and  operation  and  maintenance)   3. Successes  of  the  program   4. Challenges  of  the  program      The   information   and   data   gathered   for   this   comprehensive   review   were   found   on   the   Internet   through   Google,  Google  Scholar,  and  Ryerson  online  database  searches.    Information  was  obtained  from  reports   of  special-purpose  bodies  and  municipal  government  bodies,  consultant  briefs,  media  reports  as  well  as   program  websites.    There  was  limited  academic  literature  that  spoke  to  these  programs  in  greater  detail   than  the  sources  just  listed.

4.3 LIMITATIONS  
The   limitations   of   this   study   include   data   and   time.      Spatial   data   analysis   was   restricted   by   the   lack   of   available  data  for  Toronto's  parkland  provision,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  more  up-to-date  total  population  data   as  the  last  census  was  completed  in  2011.    Based  on  the  growth  statistics  of  the  City,  it  can  be  assumed   that  the  population  in  most  areas  of  the  City  has  increased  since  2011  and  thus  the  population  numbers   captured  within  the  school  buffers  do  not  necessarily  reflect  the  numbers  of  today.    As  well,  the  school   buffers   could   not   take   into   consideration   only   the   population   located   within   its   boundaries   as   the   population  data  could  only  be  gathered  using  entire  dissemination  areas  that  fell  within  the  buffers.    This   affected  the  number  of  residents  captured  within  the  buffers  (see  Appendix  A).       Another   restriction   was   that   there   was   no   data   set   available   that   had   the   composition   of   school   properties   in   terms   of   the   size   of   schoolyards,   green   space   or   school   building   areas   of   TDSB   schools.     Therefore,  the  ArcGIS  Online  mapping  system  and  measurement  tool  was  used  to  find  an  approximation   of  the  average  school  building  size  and  amount  of  green  space  since  it  was  difficult  to  tell  the  boundaries   of  the  actual  schoolyards.    No  other  analysis  similar  to  this  was  found  and  thus  in  the  short  time  and  data   available,   only   a   sample   of   schools   and   their   estimated   measurements   were   used   to   calculate   an   approximation   of   school   property   composition.      The   calculations   for   total   green   space   areas   used   approximated  numbers  and  they  did  not  account  for   all  of  the  TDSB  schools,  underutilized  or  not,  as  the   property  areas  could  not  be  found  for  a  few  TDSB  schools.    Thus,  these  calculations  only  provide  a  very   general  understating  of  the  composition  of  school  properties.   Lastly,   the   program   analysis   was   limited   by   both   the   lack   of   academic   and   professional   literature   that   spoke  to  detail  about  the  programs.    Media  reports  were  used  to  supplement  some  of  the  information   that  was  difficult  to  acquire  or  was  found  lacking.

5 ANALYSIS  
5.1 SPATIAL  ANALYSIS  
5.1.1 SCHOOL  PROPERTY  COMPOSITION  
When   determining   the   composition   of   school   properties   based   on   the   total   area   of   each   property   and   area   of   each   school   building,   the   calculations   were   broken   down   by   total   school   property   area   minus   school  building  area  for  the  12  school  samples.    For  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  the  remaining  space/land   of  the  school  properties  was  deemed  "green  space",  even  though  some  of  this  land  may  include  parking   lots,   cubicles,   and   asphalt   play   areas   such   as   basketball   courts.      However,   all   of   these   uses   have   the   potential  to  be  converted,  revitalized  and  incorporated  into  a  greener  schoolyard  or  schoolyard  park  and   thus   this   paper   has   identified   and   named   these   areas   as   school   "green   space".      These   calculations   are   outlined  in  Table  4  below:

Table  4:  TDSB  School  Properties'  Composition  Calculations  

Based  on  the  sample  of  twelve  TDSB  schools,  it  was  found  that  the  average  size  of  a  TDSB  school  property   is   3.79   acres   (15,311.21   m2),   the   average   school   building   footprint   is   0.75   acres   (3,056.63   m2),   and   the   average   school   green   space   3.03   acres   (12,254.58   m2).      In   other   words,   on   average   a   TDSB   school  

  

39  

   property  is  comprised  of  20%  school  building  and  80%  green  space.    Therefore,  the  amount  of  potential   green  space  that  a  school  has  to  offer  its  students  and  the  surrounding  community  is  rather  significant;  a   Toronto   neighbourhood   park   is   classified   as   usually   being   anywhere   between   1.2   to   7.4   acres   (City   of   Toronto,  2013a)  and  each  school  could  potentially  provide  around  3  acres  of  green  space  or  parkland.  

5.1.2 POTENTIAL  SCHOOL  GREEN  SPACE  PROVISION  
Using   these   calculations   of   average   school   green   space   amount   and   average   school   building   size,   generalizations  were  made  about  the  TDSB  school  system  across  the  City  of  Toronto.    The  average  school   building  area  was  multiplied  by  the  total  number  of  schools  (533)  that  had  known  property  areas.    This   number  of  total  school  building  areas  was  then  subtracted  from  the  total  area  of  all  TDSB  schools  from   the  same  data  set.    The  resulting  number  was  an  approximation  of  the  total  area  of  schoolyards  in  the   TDSB.  See  calculations  below:        CALCULATIONS  FOR  TOTAL  SCHOOLYARD  AREA  FOR  ALL  (533)  TDSB  SCHOOLS   · 3,056.63  m2  [average  school  building  area]  x  533  [schools]     13,558,872.05  m2  [sum  of  areas  of  all  TDSB  school  properties]  -  1,629,183.79  m2  [total  area   covered  by  school  buildings  in  the  TDSB]     =  1,629,183.79  m2  [total  area  covered  by  school  buildings  in  the  TDSB]   ·

   It  was  found  that  in  total,  (533)  TDSB  schools  could  provide  approximately  2,947.89  acres  (11,929,688.26   m2)   of   potential   green   space.      In   other   words,   the   TDSB   and   City   of   Toronto   have   the   opportunity   of   adding   almost   3,000   acres   of   parkland   to   the   City's   park   system   if   they   were   to   convert   every   TDSB   schoolyard   into   a   schoolyard   park.      If   the   TDSB   and   the   City   were   to   only   convert   the   green   spaces   of   schools   that   were   deemed   underutilized,   the   118   schools   could   potentially   provide   2,873,965.03   m2   of   green  space,  or  710.17  acres  of  parkland  to  the  City.    This  is  still  a  rather  significant  amount  as  70  of  these   118  underutilized  schools  are  located  within  or  right  next  to  areas  that  have  been  measured  by  the  City  as   having  the  two  lowest  parkland  provision  levels  (see  Figure  8).

   In   order   to   illustrate   where   the   underutilized   schools   are   located   in   reference   to   areas   in   Toronto   that   have  a  low  or  high  parkland  provision,  the  two  lowest  levels  of  parkland  provision  that  were  focused  on  in   this  analysis  was  "0  to  0.42"  and  "0.43  to  0.79"  hectares  of  local  parkland  per  1,000  people.       Using  the  "Local  Parkland  Provisions  ­  Map  8"  from  the  City  of  Toronto's   Official  Plan  (2010a),  the  total   green  space  area  of  all  underutilized  TDSB  Schools  located  within  or  right  next  to  the  two  lowest  parkland   provision  levels  (0  to  0.79  hectares  of  local  parkland  per  1,000  people),  was  calculated  below:   3,056.63  m2  [average  school  building  area]  x  70  [underutilized  schools  located  within  or  next  to   low  parkland  provision  areas]   =  213,964.10  m2  [total  area  covered  by  school  buildings  in  the  TDSB]   · · 1,693,173.38  m2  [sum  of  areas  of  underutilized  TDSB  school  properties  located  in  low  provision   areas]  ­  360,682.34  m2  [total  area  covered  by  school  buildings]    

=  1,479,209.28  m2  [total  green  space  area  for  all  underutilized  (70)  TDSB  schools  located  within  or  next  to   low  parkland  provision  areas]      These  70  schools  alone  could  provide  approximately  365  acres  of  green  space  to  these  areas  that  are  in   the   greatest   need   of   parkland   (0   to   0,79h).      Furthermore,   not   only   are   60%   of   underutilized   schools   located   within   low   parkland   provision   areas,   many   of   them   are   also   located   in   areas   that   the   City   has   identified  as  NIAs;  in  total,  34  underutilized  schools  are  located  within  NIAs  (see  Figure  9).

   By   converting   these   118   underutilized   schoolyards   across   the   City   into   schoolyard   parks,   within   a   5-10   minute  walk  (400m  radius)  of  these  schools,  471,055  Torontonians  would  gain  access  to  these  revitalized   green  spaces.    If  the  City  and  TDSB  were  to  only  convert  the  70  underutilized  schools  located  in  areas  that   have   the   two   lowest   parkland   provision   levels,   327,002   residents   would   still   be   able   to   walk   under   10   minutes  to  their  local  school  for  green  space  (see  Figure  8).  

5.2 COMPREHENSIVE  REVIEW  OF  PROGRAMS  
5.2.1 BOSTON:  BOSTON  SCHOOLYARD  INITIATIVE  
PURPOSE  OF  THE  PROGRAM   The   Boston   Schoolyard   Initiative   was   established   in   1995   under   the   direction   of   former   Mayor   Thomas   Menino  to  improve  the  "deplorable"  conditions  of  the  public  school  grounds  that  deteriorated  because  of   serious  neglect  (Took,  2011).    Boston  had  observed  that  its  schoolyards  were  barren  and  underutilized  by   the   community   (Meyer,   1997).      Before   the   initiative,   only   locally   inspired   and   fundraised   schoolyard   revitalizations  projects  were  carried  out  in  Boston,  leaving  out  the  majority  of  communities  who  did  not   have   the   community   capacity   or   funds   to   carry   out   such   projects.      This   eventually   led   to   the   argument   that   since   public   schoolyards   are   public   facilities,   the   City   of   Boston   should   shoulder   some   of   the   responsibility  for  improving  these  spaces  (Ibid).    Research  regarding  the  high  rates  of  childhood  obesity   strongly   suggests   implementing   comprehensive   strategies   through   changes   in   directives,   programming,   and   planning   that   increases   opportunities   for   children   to   participate   in   physical   activities   (Nakashian,   2008).      This   initiative   was   created   as   a   strategy   to   help   mitigate   this   epidemic   and   to   respond   to   community  needs.    The  goal  of  the  program,  fully  controlled  by  the  school  system,  is  to  provide  "clean,   safe  and  green"  schoolyards  (City  of  Boston,  2000,  p7).   PARTNERSHIP  FRAM EW ORK  

Structure  &  Funding:   The  Boston  Schoolyard  Initiative  (BSI)  is  based  upon  a  public-private  partnership  
between  the  City  of  Boston  (in  particular  the  Departments  of  Neighbourhood  Development  and  Basic  City   Services),  the  Boston  Public  School  Board,  and  the  Boston  Schoolyard  Funders  Collaborative.    The  Boston   Schoolyard   Funders   Collaborative   was   created   to   facilitate   the   funding   process   of   the   initiative   and   it   brings   together   a   diverse   group   of   private   funders   and   donors   that   invest   in   the   schoolyards   and   their   various   education   programs   (The   Boston   Schoolyard   Initiative,   n.d.).      The   private   sector   often   has   the   perception  that  directly  paying  the  City  or  School  Board  to  fix  something  that  their  taxes  should  cover  is   unreasonable.    However,  the  Collaborative  provides  a  venue  for  pooling  donations  into  a  privately  held  

  

43  

   fund,  whether  it  is  cash  or  particular  features  such  as  a  play  structure,  and  then  dispersing  them  to  fund   capital   and   maintenance   costs.      The   Collaborative   also   works   with   the   City   to   establish   policies   for   the   initiative  and  to  oversee  budgets  and  work  plans  (Ibid).    The  program  was  only  supposed  to  run  for  five   years   with   the   City   investing   $10   million   in   that   period,   but   due   to   the   continued   support   from   both   private  funders  and  the  public,  the  program  is  ongoing  (Kaboom,  BSI,  n.d.).    The  annual  investment  in  the   BSI   is   estimated   at   $1.2   million   from   the   City   and   $600,000   from   the   Funders   Collaborative,   with   the   Collaborative  also  investing  another  $600,000-$800,00  in  education  programs  (Ibid).    Schoolyard  groups   that   seek   financial   support   for   their   schoolyard   initiatives   have   their   funding   needs   met   by   the   Collaborative.    Planning  grants  are  awarded  to  schoolyard  groups  based  on  Requests  for  Proposals,  where   the  schools  hire  a  part-time  professional  community  organizer  to  coordinate  community  involvement  and   outreach,  build  human  capacity,  and  to  help  establish  a  schoolyard  group  (Meyer,  1997).          

Implementation:    The   BSI   identifies   four   phases   of   their   implementation   process   that   places   a   heavy  
emphasis  on  school  and  community  participation  in  all  stages  of  design,  development  and  maintenance.     The  first  phase  is   Community  Organizing  and  it  involves  bringing  together  a  "local  constituency"  that  will   assess   community   needs,   lead   and   facilitate   building   community   consensus   on   the   design   of   capital   improvements,   and   assist   with   ongoing   programming   and   maintenance   (Ibid).      The   second   phase   is  

Designing   Improvements   where   a   project   manager   from   the   Boston   Public   Facilities   Department   and   a  
landscape   architect   are   contracted   by   the   City   and   assigned   to   a   schoolyard   project.      A   Master   Plan   is   created  with  students  and  local  community  members  that  will  guide  construction  and  future  renovations.     Common   elements   of   BSI   schoolyards   include   outdoor   classrooms,   green   areas,   play   equipment,   and   sustainable   practices   such   green   roofs   and   recycled   rubber   surfaces.      The   third   phase   is   Construction   where  the  schoolyard  group,  the  City  departments,  and  the  School  Board  first  approve  the  construction   documents,   and   then   these   documents   are   put   out   to   tender   (Kaboom,   BSI,   n.d.).      Community   participation  is  strongly  encouraged  in  the  construction  process  to  lower  costs  and  foster  a  sense  of  local   ownership.      

Operation   &   Maintenance:       Once   construction   is   completed   on   any   schoolyard,   the   Funders  
Collaborative  establishes  a  Shared  Maintenance  Protocol  that  is  specific  to  each  site.    Under  all  Protocols,   the  schoolyards  are  maintained  by  custodial  staff,  friends  groups,  and  a  specially  trained  union  crew  that   travels  from  site  to  site  (Meyer,  1997).    The  crew  receives  training  from  the  Parks  Department  and  is  in   charge  of  ongoing  maintenance  of  the  schoolyards  while  communicating  with  the  local  schoolyard  group.     A   "Friends   of   the   Schoolyard"   group   of   volunteers   is   created   for   each   schoolyard   that   has   the   interest,  

  

44  

   knowledge   and   capacity   to   help   with   maintenance,   improvements   (such   as   bulb   planting   and   seasonal   cleaning),  and  to  assist  in  implementing  ongoing  educational  programs  (Ibid).           SUCCESSES   Since   1995,   the   BSI   has   transformed   a   total   of   88   schoolyards   into   centres   for   play,   learning,   and   the   community.    By  2009,  71  revitalized  schoolyards  increased  access  to  green  spaces  and  play  structures  by   125  acres  and  served  more  than  90,000  children  under  the  age  of  14  in  these  neighbourhoods  (Kaboom,   BSI,   n.d.).      Students   at   schools   with   BSI   projects   were   found   to   have   improved   math   scores,   fewer   suspensions,   and   greater   attendance   than   schools   without   BSI   projects   (Lopez,   2009).      Overall,   the   BSI   projects   had   significant,   positive   impacts   on   students   and   communities   with   100%   increase   in   physical   activity,   63.2%   improved   student   behaviour,   and   73.7%   improved   relationships   with   parents   and   the   community   (The   Boston   Schoolyard   Initiative,   n.d.).      Members   involved   in   the   BSI   largely   attribute   the   success  of  the  program  to  community  engagement  at  all  stages  and  strong  Mayoral  support  (Lopez  et  al.,   2008;  Kaboom,  BSI,  n.d.).       CHALLENGES   The  BSI's  main  challenge  was  convincing  the  School  Board  that  the  program  had  the  capacity  to  improve   their  schoolyards  and  that  a  partnership  between  public  and  private  sectors  was  possible  and  needed  to   realize  this  goal  (Nakashian,  2008).    The  Mayor  also  faced  challenges  in  allocating  money  and  authority   across   public   and   private   sectors   (Ibid).      The   funds   and   community   involvement   to   maintain   the   schoolyards  are  also  not  assured.  

5.2.2 NEW  YORK:  SCHOOLYARDS  TO  PLAYGROUNDS  PROGRAM    
PURPOSE  OF  THE  PROGRAM   The  Schoolyards  to  Playgrounds  program  in  New  York  was  established  in  2007  as  the  City  had  the  lowest   number  of  acres  of  green  space  per  person  than  any  other  large  U.S.  city  (New  York  City  Global  Partners,   2013),   and   this   was   especially   true   for   low-income   neighbourhoods   (The   Trust   for   Public   Land,   n.d.).     Many   of   these   low-income   and   park   poor   communities   also   had   schools   with   no   playground   facilities.     Mayor  Bloomberg's  PlaNYC  goal  was  to  have  every  New  Yorker  live  within  a  10-minute  walk  of  a  park  or   playground.      To   address   this   need   for   green   space,   that   City   identified   schoolyards   as   an   underutilized   resource  as  they  were  only  used  a  few  hours  a  day  by  the  school  population.    The  rest  of  the  time  the   surrounding   communities   were   not   able   to   access   these   spaces   as   they   were   locked   every   evening,   weekend  and  all  summer  (Ibid).    The  program  not  only  revitalizes  elementary  and  middle  schoolyards  but      45  

   it   also   converts   them   into   community   playgrounds   for   use   by   the   general   public   beyond   regular   school   hours.       PARTNERSHIP  FRAM EW ORK    

Structure  &  Funding:    The  Program  is  based  on  a  public-private  partnership  between  the  Department  
of  Parks  and  Recreation  (DPR),  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE),  and  the  non-profit  partner,  the  Trust   for  Public  Land  (TPL),  "which  works  in  cities  across  America  to  conserve  land  in  order  for  people  to  enjoy   local   parks,   playgrounds,   and   natural   areas"   (Ibid,   p2).      The   DOE   provided   the   land   and   onsite   maintenance,   the   DPR   had   the   expertise   in   landscape   design   and   construction,   and   the   TPL   had   experience  in  renovated  schoolyards.    The  program  is  entirely  funded  by  the  City  with  the  Mayor  initially   allocating  $117.2  million  in  capital  funding  in  the  first  five  years  to  revitalize  221  of  290  schoolyards,  and   $14.5   million   per   year   to   cover   ongoing   maintenance   costs   (Ibid).      However,   due   to   the   economic   downturn   in   2008,   funding   was   reduced   ­   but   not   eliminated.      The   TPL   raised   $8.5   million   to   provide   private  matching  dollars  for  some  of  the  schoolyard  improvements  (The  Trust  for  Public  Land,  n.d.).        

Implementation:   Using  a  GIS  mapping  program,  290  schoolyards  were  selected  for  conversion  as  they  
were   located   in   neighbourhoods   that   had   poor   access   to   park   space   but   that   had   a   high   number   of   children  (New  York  City  Global  Partners,  2013).    The  sites  were  assessed  and  classified  into  one  of  three   categories:  C1  no  improvements  required;  C2  new  equipment  required;  C3  larger  capital  improvements   required   (Ibid).      C1   sites   were   opened   immediately   to   the   community   as   they   did   not   require   any   improvements,   while   C2   and   C3   sites   received   around   $400,000   and   $1.2   million   for   renovations,   respectively  (Ibid).    From  start  to  finish,  the  three  partners  of  this  initiative  have  varying  responsibilities   on  a  site-to-site  basis.    The  design  phase  is  4-6  months  and  includes  community  consultations  that  bring   together   school   administration,   children,   parents,   neighbours   and   community   groups   to   work   with   a   landscape  architecture  team  provided  by  the  DPR  to  design  a  schoolyard  that  reflects  their  needs.    The   DPR  is  in  charge  of  managing  the  design,  bid  and  award,  and  construction  of  137  schoolyard  sites  before   turnover  to  the  DOE,  while  the  DOE  is  in  charge  of  the  same  processes  for  30  schoolyard  sites  (Ibid).    The   TPL   leads   the   community   design   and   construction   process   for   123   sites.      The   bid   and   award   phase   can   take   6-8   months,   where   design   documents   are   reviewed   and   then   awarded   to   a   contractor   while   the   construction  phase  can  also  take  another  6-8  months  (Ibid).    Common  elements  of  the  projects  include   trees,  gardens,  synthetic  turf  fields,  and  play  equipment.  

Operation   &   Maintenance:    Upon   completion   of   construction,   the   DOE   and   the   school's   custodial  
staff   assume   the   responsibility   of   operating   and   maintaining   the   schoolyards.      The   TPL   also   leads  

  

46  

   workshops  for  school  custodians,  principals  and  parent  coordinators  to  teach  programming  and  facilitate   stewardship  (New  York  City  Global  Partners,  2013).    The  school  and  community  set  their  park  hours  and   who   is   responsible   for   locking   the   schoolyard   gates;   usually   the   custodial   staff   opens   and   closes   the   schoolyard   gates   from   8am   to   dusk   during   the   week   when   school   is   not   in   session.      On   weekends   and   during   the   summer   the   schoolyards   are   also   open   from   dawn   until   dusk   with   the   responsibility   being   shared  between  the  staff  and  community  groups.   SUCCESSES   Since  inception,  the  Schoolyards  to  Playgrounds  program  has  added  more  than  150  acres  of  playground   space   and   up   until   2013,   the   number   of   New   Yorkers   within   a   ten-minute   walk   of   a   park   increased   by   more  than  500,000  people  (Ibid).    By  2011,  49  neighborhoods  had  increased  access  to  playgrounds  that   met   the   City   standard   as   measured   by   the   number   of   children   under   14   per   playground   in   a   given   neighbourhood   (Ibid).      A   study   in   2011   that   evaluated   three   schoolyard   sites   before   and   after   the   initiative   found   that   the   use   of   the   new   schoolyards   went   up   28-65%   depending   on   the   users   (school   children  or  community  members)  (Taplin,  2011).    Members  of  the  program  attribute  the  success  of  this   program  to  community  participation  in  the  design  process  and  the  strong  Mayoral  support  that  provides   the  bulk  of  the  funding  for  the  program  (The  Trust  for  Public  Land,  n.d.).   CHALLENGES   Some   of   the   challenges   faced   by   the   program   varied   site-by-site   such   as   unforeseen   construction   costs   due  to  basic  infrastructure  upgrades  not  included  in  the  budget.    Concerns  from  community  members  in   many   neighbourhoods   included   noise,   vandalism,   and   negative   behaviours,   but   the   police   and   fire   departments   were   asked   to   join   in   on   some   of   the   consultation   processes   to   address   some   of   these   security  concerns  (New  York  City  Global  Partners,  2013).    Design  strategies  also  addressed  some  of  these   concerns.    In  addition,  because  the  program  is  run  by  the  community  and  school  board,  challenges  arose   from   custodians   who   did   not   want   to   handle   the   extra   responsibility   of   park   maintenance,   and   from   community   members   who   wanted   the   schoolyards   locked   early   as   they   did   not   want   youth   playing   at   night  (Harnik,  2011).  

5.2.3 DENVER:  LEARNING  LANDSCAPES  
PURPOSE  OF  THE  PROGRAM   The   Learning   Landscapes   program   was   developed   from   a   grassroots   initiative   that   successfully   transformed  two  underutilized  Denver  Public  School  schoolyards  into  vibrant  community  spaces.    Many  

  

47  

   Denver   schoolyards   resembled   "prison   yards"   and   they   were   not   a   conducive   environment   for   play   or   learning  (ActiveEnvironments,  2013).    A  parent  at  one  of  the  public  elementary  schools  initiated  and  led   the  effort  to  revitalize  the  school's  playground.    She  was  also  a  professor  at  the  University  of  Colorado  at   Denver  (UCD)  and  engaged  her  landscape  architecture  students  to  help  design  a  playground  tailored  to   the  needs  of  the  school  and  members  of  the  community.    They  ultimately  developed  a  model  that  they   called   a   "Learning   Landscape",   which   "is   an   outdoor   area   that   supports   physical   activity,   learning,   and   improved   social   interaction"   (Kaboom   Denver,   n.d.,   p1).      The   successful   transformation   of   this   first   schoolyard  in  1998  was  then  tested  out  on  a  second  elementary  school  that  was  located  in  a  community   with   fewer   resources   than   the   first   but   in   dire   need   of   renovations.      Through   hard   work   and   determination,  local  leadership  was  rallied,  political  interest  was  gained,  funds  were  raised  through  public   and  private  donors,  and  ultimately  the  schoolyard  was  transformed.    It  became  the  model  of  community   mobilization  and  a  catalyst  for  the  development  of  the  formal  program.   The  two  schoolyard  transformations  inspired  key  public  and  private  sectors  leaders  to  form  the  Learning   Landscape   Alliance   (LLA)   in   2001   and   its   goal   was   to   recreate   these   successes   at   22   other   underserved   schools   in   the   City   of   Denver.      A   number   of   factors   lead   to   the   creation   of   the   "Learning   Landscapes"   Program:   (1)   derelict   and   aging   elementary   school   infrastructure,   (2)   community   needs   were   not   being   met  which  lead  to  a  community-based  initiative,  (3)  the  University  of  Colorado  required  its  architecture   students   to   take   on   a   real-life   civic   engagement   project,   (4)   the   elimination   of   school   busing   programs   meant   that   more   students   were   going   to   schools   in   their   own   neighbourhoods   again,   and   (5)   funding   from   the   city,   state   and   non-profits   made   it   possible   to   start   and   implement   the   program   (ActiveEnvironments,  2013).

Structure  &  Funding:    The  Learning  Landscapes  program  is  a  public-private  partnership  that  identifies  
as  having  a  top-down  and  bottom-up  approach  to  implementation.    At  the  top  level  are  the  Denver  Public   School  Board  (DPS),  the  UCD,  the  City  and  County  of  Denver,  and  private  foundations.    In  the  middle  are   the  community  based  and  neighbourhood  organizations,  and  the  individual  elementary  schools.    At  the   bottom  level  are  the  children,  youth,  parents  and  community  members  (Ibid).    A  unique  partner  in  this   initiative  is  the  UCD  where  the  College  of  Architecture  and  Planning  entered  into  a  formal  agreement  in   1999  with  the  DPS  to  plan,  design,  and  help  build  Learning  Landscapes  at  DPS  elementary  schools  (Ibid).     Denver's   Office   of   Economic   Development   awarded   LLA   a   total   of   $5.1   million   in   the   first   three   years   beginning   in   2001   and   the   LLA   raised   a   total   of   $9   million   in   that   same   time   period   (Kaboom,   Denver,

   n.d.).      Converting   each   school   costs   around   $450,000   and   funding   for   each   schoolyard   can   be   broken   down   roughly   by   program   partner   contributions:   City   of   Denver   $140K,   the   DPS   $160K,   the   DPS   in-kind   donations  $40K,  Foundations  $80K,  individual  volunteer  donations  $50K,  and  elementary  school  donation   $10K  (Harnik,  2011).    The  school  community  is  required  to  raise  1-2%  of  the  cost  of  the  project  while  the   rest   of   the   partners   individually   do   not   contribute   more   than   25%   of   the   cost   of   any   playground   renovation   (Kaboom,   Denver,   n.d.).      After   22   schools   in   underserved   communities   were   revitalized   by   2003,   the   DPS   Board   proposed   bond   measures   for   $39   million   to   begin   expanding   the   Learning   Landscapes  program  to  every  DPS  elementary  schoolyard.  It  was  approved  and  24  additional  sites  were   revitalized.      Voters  again  expressed  their  satisfaction  with  the  program  by  passing  another  bond  in  2008   for   $29   million   so   that   the   remaining   37   schoolyards   in   the   school   system   could   become   Learning   Landscapes  (ActiveEnvironments,  2013).      

Implementation:    The   Learning   Landscapes   Program   is   largely   a   community   undertaking   as   local  
residents  provide  input  during  the  design  process  and  then  participate  in  the  building  process.    The  UCD   students   first   help   community   members   redesign   their   schoolyards   to   reflect   their   needs.      Then   each   school  must  form  a  Learning  Landscape  Team  comprised  of  students,  parents  and  community  members,   to   assist   with   the   design   and   programming   decisions,   and   to   assist   with   ongoing   maintenance   upon   project  completion.    The  construction  phase  also  involves  heavy  community  involvement  as  a  volunteer   build   day   is   established   for   every   project   to   develop   "a   sense   of   ownership   and   civic   pride"   (Ibid).     Common   elements   of   Learning   Landscapes   include   irrigated   and   drained   areas   with   a   field,   play   structures,   hard   surface   court,   public   art   works,   habitat   areas,   shade   structures,   and   a   community   gateway  that  symbolically  invites  the  community  in  (Harnik,  2011).          

Operation   &   Maintenance:       The   DPS   is   responsible   for   maintaining   the   schoolyards   and   it   costs  
roughly   $25,000   per   site   per   year,   including   activities   such   as   re-seeding,   fertilizing,   and   watering   (Kaboom,  Denver,  n.d.).    However,  it  is  assumed  that  the  community  and  the  Learning  Landscape  Team   will   continue   to   help   and   share   in   the   responsibility   of   maintaining   the   new   schoolyards.      In   almost   all   cases,   continued   community   engagement   has   been   impactful   as   an   estimated   $26,000   worth   of   labour   and   materials   is   contributed   by   volunteers   at   each   site   per   year   (Kaboom,   Denver,   n.d.).      In   order   to   obtain  state  funding  to  design  and  build  the  projects,  the  schools  are  required  to  open  the  schoolyards  to   the  community  after  school  hours  and  on  weekends.   SUCCESSES  

  

49  

   Between   2001   and   2013,   $49   million   was   raised   to   convert   96   DPS   elementary   schools   to   Learning   Landscapes  (ActiveEnvironments,  2013).    These  projects  now  serve  more  than  46,500  students  daily  and   over  500,000  city  residents  (Ibid).    In  2010,  a  study  was  completed  to  evaluate  whether  the  schoolyard   redevelopment  lead  to  an  increase  in  use  and  physical  activity  levels  in  children.    Observations  were  made   before  and  school  hours  and  it  was  found  that  the  renovated  playgrounds  had  significantly  higher  levels   of   physical   activity   than   schoolyards   that   had   not   yet   been   renovated   (Brink   et   al.,   2010).      It   was   also   found  that  both  boys'  and  girls'  physical  activity  rates  were  significantly  higher  in  areas  of  the  schoolyard   that  had  soft  surface  structures  such  as  grass  fields  or  play  equipment  (Ibid).    Another  added  benefit  that   grew  from  the  initiative  was  that  the  Learning  Landscape  schools  that  decided  to  implement  gardens  had   less   vandalism   and   generated   greater   school/community   involvement   in   using,   maintaining,   and   managing  the  schoolyards.     CHALLENGES   One  key  challenge  of  the  program  was  the  capacity  of  the  ground  crews  of  the  DPS  to  maintain  certain   aspects  of  the  sites  that  were  beyond  their  expertise.    For  example,  many  of  the  crews  were  not  trained   to  care  for  the  natural  grasses  and  plants,  and  so  over  time  and  with  DPS  funding,  Learning  Landscapes   took   over   the   responsibility   for   overseeing   the   maintenance   that   is   beyond   the   capability   of   the   DPS   crews   (Kaboom,   Denver,   n.d.).         Another   challenge   is   because   this   initiative   is   community-based,   the   support  from  neighbours  may  not  always  be  there  if  locals  leave  and  others  move  in  who  do  not  have  the   same  attachment  or  sense  of  stewardship  to  these  local  schoolyards.    Additionally,  since  the  schoolyards   are   funded   by   the   DPS,   school   closures   would   completely   cut   the   funding   of   these   spaces   and   the   maintenance  would  then  fall  completely  on  the  community  (Ibid).    To  mitigate  school  closures  particularly   in   high-needs   areas,   the   DPS   and   the   Denver   Park   and   Recreation   Department   are   beginning   to   work   much   more   closely   to   develop   more   integrated   master   plans   that   consider   the   broad   park   system   and   playground  needs  of  each  community  (Ibid).    

5.2.4 HOUSTON:  SCHOOL  TO  PARK  PROGRAM  
PURPOSE  OF  THE  PROGRAM   The  SPARK  program  has  a  long  history  of  transforming  schoolyards  into  community  parks  in  Houston.    It   was  first  founded  in  1983  as  one  of  the  initial  responses  to  a  report  completed  by  City  and  County,  which   stated   that   Houston   would   need   at   least   5,000   acres   of   additional   parkland   in   order   to   measure   up   to   other  U.S.  cities  standards  (Spark  School  Park  Program,  n.d.).    The  City  reasoned  that  the  fastest  and  most   cost  effective  way  of  increasing  park  acreage  was  using  already  available  public  land  such  as  schoolyards.    

  

50  

   During  the  program's  first  25  years  it  converted  203  schoolyards  into  "SPARK  Parks"  and  it  was  not  until   1996  that  the  program  was  finally  assigned  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  mayor  (Harnik,  2011).           PARTNERSHIP  FRAM EW ORK    

Structure   &   Funding:      The   SPARK   program   is   a   public-private   partnership   between   the   City  
(Department   of   Housing   and   Community   Development),   14   School   Districts   within   the   Houston-Harris   County   area,   as   well   as   businesses,   non-profits,   and   at   times,   the   University   of   Houston   School   of   Architecture   (Spark   School   Park   Program,   n.d.).   A   typical   SPARK   park   costs   between   $75,000   and   $100,000  to  build.    The  City  of  Houston  provides  approximately  50%  of  the  funding  in  the  form  of  Federal   Block  Grants  that  schools  must  first  qualify  for  by  being  located  in  areas  where  the  population  is  defined   as  having  low  or  moderate  income  (Harnik,  2011).    A  school  must  then  apply  to  join  the  program  and  it   must  outline  how  the  school  and  school  board  will  help  plan  and  fund  their  required  $5,000  contribution   for  each  individual  project.    In  addition,  two  of  the  four  county  commissioners  commit  $5,000  to  parks  in   their   jurisdictions   and   corporate   sponsors   for   each   school   donate   an   additional   $5,000   (Ownby,   2005).     The   SPARK   program   with   the   City   selects   around   10-15   sites   per   year   depending   on   the   site's   needs,   location,  and  the  ability  and  willingness  of  the  community  to  be  involved  in  the  project  (Spark  School  Park   Program,  n.d.).    

Implementation:     Once  the  City  and  SPARK  program  select  a  site,  a  SPARK  committee  for  the  school  is  
formed,   which   includes   parents,   teachers,   neighbourhood   leaders,   and   other   community   and   staff   members.    The  committee  and  community  members  then  work  with  an  architect  that  is  either  provided   by   SPARK,   is   a   volunteer   from   the   community,   or   a   few   master   of   architecture   students   from   the   University  of  Houston  who  take  on  the  design  aspect  of  the  project  as  part  of  their  curriculum  (Ownby,   2005).      Upon   completion   of   the   design   plans,   the   construction   documents   are   put   out   to   bid   and   contractors  are  hired  by  the  school  district.    Community  members  and  students  are  also  encouraged  to   assist  in  the  construction  process  to  facilitate  stewardship  and  build  a  sense  of  ownership.    No  artificial   turf   is   allowed   to   be   used   and   common   elements   of   a   SPARK   park   are   play   equipment,   picnic   tables,   outdoor  classrooms,  native  trees  and  gardens  (Harnik,  2011).      

Operation  &  Maintenance:       In   addition   to   being   solely   responsible   for   the   ongoing   maintenance   of  
the  SPARK  park,  the  school  district  is  also  in  charge  of  providing  other  secondary  services  associated  with   the   program   such   as   printing   SPARK's   business   materials,   networking,   and   basic   problem  solving   (Spark   School  Park  Program,  n.d.).    Classes,  parents  and  neighbourhood  groups  may  volunteer  to  take  care  of  the  

  

51  

   natural   vegetation   found   in   the   parks.      The   schools   are   required   to   leave   the   parks   open   to   the   public   during  non-school  hours  and  on  weekends  for  ten  years  (TPL,  2015).   SUCCESSES   Since   1983,   the   program   has   turned   more   than   200   schoolyards   into   neighbourhood   parks   (TPL,   2015).     The  SPARK  parks  serve  over  317,000  people,  130,000  of  which  live  in  areas  that  do  not  have  any  other   access  to  parks  and  open  space  closer  than  half  a  mile  from  their  homes  (TPL,  2015).    A  study  completed   by  the  TPL  in  2015  assessed  the  conditions  of  the  SPARK  parks  and  their  effects  on  the  neighbourhood.    It   was  found  that  86%  of  users  reported  that  SPARK  parks  were  the  primary  park  they  visited  and  58%  of   users  did  not  visit  other  parks  (TPL,  2015).   CHALLENGES   There   were   a   couple   notable   challenges   that   needed   to   be   addressed   when   creating   and   refining   the   SPARK  program.    One  was  that  it  was  difficult  to  develop  agreements  and  partnerships  between  different   organizations   that   have   differing   priorities   and   therefore   strong   leaders,   such   as   the   mayor   and   school   board   trustee,   which   in   this   case   were   instrumental   (Ownby,   2005).      A   second   challenge   was   that   the   community  and  school  board  needed  to  be  on  board  with  having  school  properties  openly  accessible  by   the  public.    Liability  issues  were  a  concern  for  the  school  board  until  the  state  of  Texas  agreed  to  legally   protect  schools  and  cities  from  certain  incidents  that  could  occur  on  public  grounds  (Harnik,  2011).    

5.2.5 KEY  FINDINGS  
Upon   review   of   these   initiatives,   a   number   of   similarities   can   be   identified   that   contributed   to   the   successful  implementation  and  on-going  operation  of  these  programs.    The  first  is  the  reason  why  these   initiatives   were   established   in   the   first   place;   all   of   the   programs   were   initiated   because   all   four   cities   realized  they  were  growing  in  population  and  in  density  but  the  development  of  parks  was  not  keeping   pace  with  this  growth.    As  a  result,  Boston,  New  York,  Denver,  and  Houston  had  low  ratios  of  parkland  to   people   and   this   limited   access   to   parkland   was   contributing   to   the   decline   of   the   physical   and   mental   health  of  their  residents.    In  order  to  add  more  parkland  in  their  already  built-up  urban  centres,  the  four   cities  chose  to  convert  public  schoolyards  into  schoolyard  parks  as  these  spaces  were  already  considered   public  assets.    As  in  many  other  North  American  cities,  the  schoolyards  in  Boston,  New  York,  Denver,  and   Houston   were   all   described   as   barren,   derelict,   and   predominantly   asphalt.      These   spaces   were   thus   identified  as  being  underutilized  as  they  were  lacking  interactive  play  and  education  facilities/structures,   and  green  space.      

  

52  

   The  framework  for  the  four  initiatives  are  also  fairly  similar  since  they  are  all  public-private  partnerships   that   involve   strong   participation   and   leadership   from   their   respective   city   mayors,   various   city   departments,   and   their   local   public   school   boards.      Most   notably,   strong   mayoral   support,   particularly   through  policy  development  and  funding,  was  essential  to  the  fruition  of  the  programs  as  in  the  United   States  the  mayor  has  governance  over  the  public  school  boards.    Interestingly,  only  New  York's  initiative   involves   the   City's   parks   department   within   the   partnership   framework.      All   initiatives   rely   on   private   sector   entities   such   as   non-profits,   foundations,   businesses,   and   private   donors   to   help   fund   the   programs.   The   last   but   most   important   factor   in   all   four   initiatives   is   community   engagement.      They   all   greatly   attribute  the  success  of  each  program  to  community  involvement  at  every  stage  of  the  projects  including   fundraising,   design,   construction   and   maintenance.      They   argue   that   not   only   does   this   create   new   schoolyard  parks  that  met  the  particular  needs  of  the  community,  involving  students,  residents,  and  local   groups  in  the  implementation  and  maintenance  of  the  program,  but  it  also  develops  community  capacity,   stewardship,  and  a  sense  of  pride  and  ownership.     Where   the   initiatives   differ   depends   upon   who   are   the   major   stakeholders   in   the   partnerships,   which   entity   funds   the   majority   of   the   initiative,   and   which   entity   maintains   the   schoolyard   park   once   renovations  are  completed.

6 CONCLUSION  
6.1 DEFINING  THE  CONCEPT  OF  A  `SCHOOLYARD  PARK'  
The   outdoor   spaces   associated   with   a   public   school   are   meant   to   serve   the   recreational   needs   of   students,  but  they  can  do  so  much  more  than  that.    Schoolyards  are  predominantly  flat,  open  spaces  and   the   "great   schoolyards   ­   the   rare   ones   that   have   healthy   grass,   big   trees,   a   playground,   and   sports   equipment  ­  seem  a  lot  like  parks"  (Harnik,  2012,  p110).    Green  spaces  such  as  parks  have  been  shown  to   improve  mental  and  physical  health,  foster  the  protection  and  development  of  the  natural  environment,   and   provide   significant   economic   benefits   to   citizens,   communities,   and   cities   as   a   whole.      Green   schoolyards   in   particular   have   been   found   to   positively   impact   the   cognitive,   social,   and   behavioural   development  of  children.   However,  maintaining  schoolyards  to  the  standards  of  parks  is  expensive  and  school  boards  have  found  it   difficult   to   rationalize   spending   money   on   horticulture   for   the   greater   benefit   of   the   community   rather   than  spending  their  tight  budgets  on  necessary  maintenance  and  to  school  improvements  (Ibid).    School   boards  are  also  uneasy  in  regards  to  opening  up  their  schoolyards  the  public  due  to  liability,  insurance,   safety,   and   supervision   issues,   and   they   are   also   reluctant   to   give   up   control   of   their   schoolyard   to   city   parks  departments  who  can  offer  maintenance  help  (Ibid;  Marrow  &  Frost,  2012).   The   unfortunate   reality   of   many   North   American   schoolyards   is   that   they   resemble   parking   lots   more   than   parks.      These   poor   conditions   only   further   deter   community   members   from   using   these   spaces.      In   the   United   States,   it   is   very   common   for   school   districts   to   lock   their   school   grounds   and   keep   them   closed   from   the   public.     In   this   American   context,   Harnik   describes   the   potential   of   a   "schoolyard   park"   as   "a   space   F igure  1 0:  T CDS B  Priva te  Prop ert y  S ign    reserved   for   school-children   during   the   school   hours   and   used   by   the   whole   community   at   other   times"   (2012,   p111).      Although   most   public   school   boards  in  Canada  do  not  lock  their  school  grounds,  many  of  them  are  fenced  off  with  closed  gates  and   have  discouraging  signage  posted  around  the  property  (see  Figure  10).  

  

54  

   These   restricting   designs   have   been   shown   to   have   a   negative   impact   on   the   use   of   schoolyards.      For   example,   in   2010   in   the   City   of   Toronto,   Hillcrest   Junior   Public   School   locked   one   of   the   major   entranceways  into  its  schoolyard,  which  was  highly  used  as  community  path  that  linked  one  side  of  the   neighbourhood   to   another.      The   school   attached   a   sign   reading   "Private   Property:   No   Trespassing",   leaving  only  one  entrance  open  to  the  schoolyard  for  one  part  of  the  community  (Schabas,  2010).    The   school  parents  and  community  members  understood  keeping  gates  locked  during  school  hours  but  they   were  upset  by  the  negative  impacts  the  sign  and  the  physical  barriers  would  have  on  community  access   to  the  schoolyard  during  non-school  hours.    After  a  few  months  of  having  the  community  link  barred  and   providing   only   a   single   access   point,   the   schoolyard   became   deserted   and   began   attracting   negative   behaviour   from   teenagers   (Ibid).      Tensions   such   as   this   between   communities   and   the   TDSB   have   only   grown  worse  due  to  the  TDSB  identifying  a  number  of  school  properties  as  underutilized  and/or  surplus.   The   jurisdictional   distinction   of   whether   a   public   green   space   is   a   City-owned   park   or   a   TDSB-owned   playing   field   is   of   little   matter   to   the   surrounding   community   who   are   chiefly   concerned   about   having   access  and  use  of  such  an  amenity.  

6.2 HOW  TORONTONIANS  CAN  BENEFIT  FROM  SCHOOLYARD  PARKS  
As  has  been  demonstrated  through  the  City  of  Toronto's  Parkland  Provision  Map,  there  are  many  areas  in   the   City   that   are   in   need   of   parks.      However,   the   City   is   facing   a   number   of   challenges   that   impede   parkland  development  which  include  scarcity  of  available  land  for  acquisition,  expensive  land  pricing,  and   a   slow   and   rigid   acquisition   process.      Other   high   density   and   built   up   cities   in   North   America   have   very   similar   issues   and   they   have   begun   developing   creative   strategies   such   as   repurposing   already   existing   green   space   to   meet   their   parkland   needs.      A   trending   strategy   over   recent   years   has   been   to   convert   schoolyards   into   schoolyard   parks.      Schoolyards   have   been   identified   by   park   scholars,   advocates,   non- profit  groups,  and  local  park  staff  as  underutilized  resources  due  to  their  lack  of  amenities  and  greenery.     Cities  such  as  Boston,  New  York,  Denver  and  Houston  have  created  initiatives  to  take  advantage  of  these   existing  `public'  spaces  and  formalize  them  into  schoolyard  parks.    Many  of  Toronto's  public  schoolyards   can   also   be   deemed   underutilized   and   in   fact,   TDSB   schools   and   schoolyards   are   under   threat   of   being   sold  due  to  this  very  issue.    Therefore,  the  City  of  Toronto  and  the  TDSB  have  the  opportunity  to  learn  and   draw  upon  ideas  from  other  city  initiatives  to  create  their  own  strategy  that  revitalizes  schoolyards  into   schoolyard  parks.

   For  the  context  of  Toronto,  this  paper  defines  "schoolyard  parks"  as  a  schoolyard  space  that  is  open  to   the  public  before  and  after  school  hours,  and  that  has  similar  amenities  to  "neighbourhood  parks"  such  as   playgrounds,  gardens,  and  naturalized  areas.    This  is  because  schoolyards  have  been  found  to  be  similar  in   size  and  with  the  potential  to  carry  the  same  role  as  "neighbourhood  parks"  in  the  City  of  Toronto.      

6.2.1 POTENTIAL  INCREASE  IN  QUALITY  OF  LIFE  
Green   spaces   and   urban   parks   have   been   found   to   provide   numerous   and   various   types   of   benefits   to   those   who   frequent   them.      Researchers   from   a   wide   rage   of   disciplines   have   found   that   urban   green   spaces   can   improve   mental   health   and   well-being   by   reducing   diseases   such   as   depression,   ADHD,   and   mental  fatigue.    They  also  serve  as  spaces  that  promote  physical  activity,  which  in  turn  has  been  shown  to   positively   affect   physical   well-being   by   reducing   diseases   such   as   obesity,   type   2   diabetes,   and   heart   disease.      Contact   with   natural   environments   has   also   shown   to   greatly   reduce   stress   and   promote   relaxation,  key  factors  that  have  been  shown  to  negatively  affect  mental  and  physical  well-being.    From   an  environmental  standpoint,  increasing  green  spaces  can  mitigate  the  negative,  physical  effects  of  urban   environments  such  as  reducing  storm  water  runoff,  reducing  energy  costs  through  shade,  minimizing  the   urban  heat  island  effect,  and  improving  aesthetics.    Economically  speaking,  public  parks  have  been  proven   to  benefit  urban  areas  in  a  number  of  ways  including  increasing  property  values,  tourism,  and  business   vitality.    They  have  also  been  shown  to  reduce  government  expenditure  on  health  services  by  improving   factors   such   as   cleaner   air   and   water,   and   overall   physical   and   mental   well-being.      Lastly,   it   has   been   found   that   the   more   green,   aesthetically   pleasing,   and   large   a   park   space   is   the   more   likely   the   community  will  use  it.  

6.2.2 POTENTIAL  INCREASE  IN  AMOUNT  OF  GREEN  SPACE  
As   this   comprehensive   program   review   has   indicated,   revitalizing   schoolyards   brings   the   community's   value   and   use   of   a   schoolyard   to   the   forefront,   thereby   (re-)establishing   a   schoolyard's   role   to   equally   serve  the  needs  of  students  and  the  community.    Turning  Toronto's  schoolyards  into  schoolyard  parks  can   provide  the  TDSB  (and  other  School  Boards)  with  more  justification  to  protect  and  keep  their  schools  and   schoolyards.      Additionally,   due   to   the   TDSB's   deficit   and   decreased   funding,   an   initiative   similar   to   the   ones  reviewed  above  that  incorporates  a  number  of  partners  for  maintenance  and  funding  could  provide   the   TDSB   with   a   solution   for   financing   schoolyard   improvements.      Equally,   the   City   of   Toronto   would   benefit  from  such  an  initiative,  as  more  parkland  would  not  necessarily  have  to  be  acquired  in  order  to   increase   park   access.      The   spatial   analysis   demonstrated   that   if   all   (533)   TDSB   schools   converted   their  

  

56  

   schoolyards   to   schoolyard   parks,   almost   3,000   acres   of   parkland   could   be   added   to   Toronto's   park   system;  if  only  underutilized  schoolyards  were  converted,  710.17  acres  could  still  be  added.    The  analysis   also  showed  that  60%  of  underutilized  schools  are  located  within  areas  that  have  been  labeled  as  the  two   lowest   parkland   provision   levels,   and   these   70   schools   could   provide   approximately   365   acres   of   green   space  to  these  areas  that  are  in  the  greatest  need  of  parkland.    Approximately  327,000  residents  in  these   areas  alone  could  gain  access  to  green  space  from  such  an  initiative.    Therefore,  the  amount  of  parkland   that  could  be  added  to  the  City  of  Toronto  by  turning  schoolyards  into  schoolyard  parks  is  substantial  and   the  associated  benefits  of  green  spaces  can  be  significant  to  many  residents.

7 RECOMMENDATIONS  
Based   on   the   comprehensive   review   of   schoolyard   park   initiatives,   as   well   as   the   opportunities   and   challenges  in  Toronto  for  implementing  such  an  initiative,  two  recommendations  are  presented.    The  first   recommendation  is  to   establish  a  park  goal  for  the  City  of  Toronto  and  the  second  recommendation  is  to  

establish  a  City  of  Toronto,  Toronto  District  School  Board,  and  Ministry  of  Education  formal  partnership.    
The  steps  for  implementing  the  recommendations  are  outlined  and  summarized  below:   Establish  a  Park  Goal   Parks,  Forestry  and  Recreation  Division,  along  with  other  City  Divisions  and  public  landholders,  to   create  a  City  of  Toronto  Park  Goal  that  will  realize  the  PF&R's  vision  of  being  a  "City  within  a   Park".   Establish  a  Formal  Partnership   1. Align  interests  and  priorities  of  the  Ministry  Education,  TDSB  (or  other  school  boards),  and  the   City  of  Toronto.    The  Ministry  and  TDSB  should:   a. Establish  schools  as  community  hubs   b. Reform  the  funding  structures  to  continue  to  reflect  student  enrolment,  but  to  prioritize   and  maintain  the  funding  of  schools  located  in  low  parkland  provision  areas   c. Reform  the  assessment  process  of  TDSB  schools  to  equally  weigh  student  enrolment  and   community  utilization  of  school  properties   d. Provide  price  breaks  on  surplus  school  properties  to  other  government,  public,  or  non- profit  entities   2. Redefine  complementary  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Ministry,  School  Boards  (specifically,  the   TDSB)  and  the  City  of  Toronto     a. Establish  a  funding  agreement  between  City  of  Toronto  and  TDSB     i. City  of  Toronto  to  use  parkland  reserve  funds  to  help  fund  revitalization  and   maintenance  costs  of  schoolyard  parks   b. Establish  a  maintenance  protocol  between  government  entities  and  other  potential   stakeholders   i. PF&R  to  provide  TDSB  caretaking  staff  with  training  on  how  to  maintain   schoolyard  parks   ii. PF&R  to  provide  staff  to  assist  with  capital  projects,  repairs  and  on-going   maintenance   3. Identify  other  potential  partners  for  project  implementation,  funding,  and  on-going  maintenance   a. TDSB  EcoSchools  Program   b. Toyota  Evergreen  Learning  Grounds  Program   c. Park  People   d. Other  public  and  private  partners      If  the  TDSB  were  to  provide  space  for  parkland,  a  win-win  situation  would  occur  between  all  three   government  entities,  with  each  entity  accruing  a  number  of  benefits:

7.1 ESTABLISH  A  PARK  GOAL  
Other  than  the  Boston  Schoolyard  Initiative,  all  other  initiatives  or  their  cities  reviewed  in  this  paper  had   parkland  goals  or  targets  to  meet.    For  example,  some  goals  were  to  provide  every  New  Yorker  a  park  or   playground   within   a   10-minute   walk,   to   add   an   additional   5,000   acres   of   parkland   to   Houston,   or   revitalize/green  a  target  number  of  schools  every  year.    As  the  City  of  Toronto  does  not  currently  have   any   goal   or   target   for   its   parkland   system   as   do   most   other   municipalities   in   Canada,   establishing   a   parkland   goal   can   be   a   valuable   tool   that   drives   programs   and   policies.      Goals   and   targets   provide   a   rationale   for   the   creation   of   programs,   it   supports   a   program's   structure,   it   drives   action,   mobilizes   stakeholders,   and   it   holds   programs   accountable.      With   no   goal   or   target   to   reach,   committees   and   programs   are   less   likely   to   succeed   in   affecting   change,   as   there   is   no   measure   for   improvement.     Additionally,   a   goal   or   target   can   rally   together   support   ­   both   in   participation   and   finances   ­   from   a   variety   of   individuals   and   groups   since   they   can   see   how   their   support   will   be   effectively   utilized.     Therefore,   if   the   City   of   Toronto   is   to   adopt   and   realize   the   vision   of   being   "a   City   within   a   Park",   the   Parks,   Forestry   and   Recreation   Division   must   communicate   with   other   City   Divisions   and   public   landholders   to   establish   a   park   goal   that   everyone   can   support.      Specifically,   the   broader   City   Divisions   and   Council   members,   the   TDSB,   and   the   Province   must   adopt   this   vision   and   agree   to   establish  a   park   goal.    At  a  minimum,  the  City  should  commit  to  not  going  below  the  current  ratio  of  parkland  to  people  as   Toronto  continues  to  intensify.

7.2 ESTABLISH  A  FORMAL  PARTNERSHIP  
While  the  City  of  Toronto  and  the  TDSB  already  have  established  partnerships  for  joint  use  agreements   and  community  use  of  certain  school  spaces  such  as  pools,  and  they  have  recently  created  a  City-School   Advisory  Committee,  there  is  much  more  to  be  done.    The  joint  use  agreements  provide  a  good  starting   point  for  applying  an  initiative  across  the  entire  City  at  various  TDSB  school  sites.    In  addition,  the  Advisory   Committee   is   poised   to   set   recommendations   on   how   to   develop   "a   new   multilateral,   consultative   relationship   for   the   City   of   Toronto,   the   School   Boards,   and   the   Province   of   Ontario   with   respect   to   schools  lands  disposition"  (City  of  Toronto,  2015b,  p1).    However,  a  formal  partnership  structure  has  yet   to   be   developed   by   the   Advisory   Committee,   and   for   the   purposes   of   implementing   a   schoolyard   park   initiative,  a  "consultative  relationship"  between  these  three  actors  may  not  be  enough.    All  four  initiatives   reviewed   had   on-going   and   active   participation   from   both   their   school   board   and   their   city,   whether   it   was  through  the  design,  construction,  funding  and/or  maintenance  of  the  schoolyard  parks.    All  initiatives   also  credited  "strong  mayoral  support"  as  a  key  contributor  to  the  successes  of  the  initiatives.       Firstly,  in  order  to  establish  successful  partnership  among  different  entities,  the  priorities  and  interests  of   each   group   must   be   aligned   to   the   same   purpose   and   goals   of   the   initiative.      As   reviewed,   the   Ontario   Ministry,  School  Boards,  and  the  City  of  Toronto,  are  in  agreement  that  the  school  system  should  expand   into   growth   areas   and   the   schools   should   provide   children   with   spaces   for   learning,   as   well   as   non- educational  services,  programs  and  facilities.    All  three  government  entities  have  published  reports  and   meeting   minutes   that   encourage   the   use   of   schools   by   community   members   and   promote   establishing   schools   as   community   hubs.      However,   the   current   policies   in   place   by   the   Ministry   and   the   TDSB   in   regards   to   funding   and   assessing   their   schools   do   not   heavily   consider   a   school's   role   within   the   community,  and  therefore  do  not  consider  schools  as  a  community  hub  as  a  priority.    As  mentioned,  the   City   has   repeatedly   made   efforts   to   address   these   differences   over   the   last   few   years,   calling   for   discussions  and  collaborations  between  the  TDSB  and  the  City  to  find  ways  to  alter  the  funding  structure   of   schools,   to   ensure   that   school   green   spaces   are   preserved,   and   to   assist   with   generating   funding   to   support  infrastructure  investment  of  TDSB  schools  (City  of  Toronto,  2013b,  p3;  TDSB,  2014).       The  Ontario  Ministry  of  Education  and  the  TDSB  must  first  recognize  schools  as  community  hubs  in  their   policies   and   continue   to   promote   their   establishment.      The   Ministry   and   the   TDSB   must   then   reform/revise   their   assessment   and   funding   processes   of   TDSB   schools   to   support   an   alignment   of   interest  and  priorities  between  the  three  government  bodies.    These  changes  include:  the  assessment  of  

  

60  

   school   utilization   based   on   student   enrolment   and   equally   communities'   utilization   of   schools;   and   the   funding  structure  of  schools  to  reflect  student  enrolment  and  to  continue  to  provide  funding  for  `priority'   schools  located  in  NIAs  and  areas  with  the  lowest  provision  of  parkland.    However,  this  is  dependent  on   the   City   to   help   fund   the   construction   and   on-going   maintenance   of   such   schools.      If   the   Ministry   and   TDSB  remain  adamant  about  selling  school  properties,  two  recommendations  are  proposed.    The  first  is   that  only  the  schools  located  within  areas  that  have  the  highest  level  of  parkland  provision  are  allowed  to   be   surplused   and   sold.      The   second   is   to   provide   other   government,   public,   or   non-profit   entities   price   breaks  or  discounts  on  surplus  schools  in  order  to  make  a  real  effort  to  have  school  lands  remain  public.   Secondly,   the   alignment   of   interests   and   priorities   will   require   the   roles   and   responsibilities   of   the   Province,  TDSB,  and  City  of  Toronto  to  be  redefined  so  that  they  may  mutually  support  each  other  in  their   endeavor   to   retain   and   maintain   schools   as   educational   and   community   facilities   in   the   public   realm.     Funding   and   maintenance   agreements   between   the   TDSB   and   City   of   Toronto   should   be   developed   to   share  the  costs  and  responsibilities  of  implementing  and  operating  schoolyard  parks.    The  City  has  long   benefited   from   having   public   schoolyards   provide   open   space   to   surrounding   communities,   at   no   expense.    It  is  I  the  City's  interest,  on  behalf  of  its  under-served  residents,  to  support  the  TDSB  when  both   entities  are  currently  facing  challenges  that  can  be  simultaneously  addressed  through  a  partnership.    The   TDSB   has   ownership   over   schoolyard   space   but   the   limited   funding   from   the   Province   and   the   TDSB's   deficit  and  maintenance  backlog  does  not  provide  any  room  in  the  capital  or  operating  budgets  to  renew   schoolyards.    The  City  has  large  sums  of  money  within  its  parkland  reserve  funds,  however,  it  is  finding  it  a   challenge  to  acquire  new  park  space  because  of  limited  land  availability  and  high  land  prices.    By  bringing   these  two  entities  together  to  a  common  goal  of  schoolyard  greening,  a  win-win  situation  would  occur:   the  TDSB  would  provide  the  land  that  could  be  turned  into  a  schoolyard  park  and  retain  ownership  over   it,   and   the   City   could   help   fund   renovation   and   maintenance   costs   through   its   parkland   reserve   funds   instead  of  spending  huge  sums  of  money  on  acquiring  new  land.    In  return  for  providing  schoolyards  as   formal  parkland  for  the  greater  community,  TDSB  schools  would  then  have  schoolyards  that  provide  their   students   with   natural,   interactive   and   engaging   landscapes   that   can   enhance   their   learning   and   development.      The   City   would   obtain   many   acres   of   parkland   that   would   most   likely   not   have   to   be   remediated   (as   with   many   other   non-residential   sites   in   Toronto),   and   most   of   these   new   parks   would   already   be   located   in   ideal   places,   i.e.   residential   areas   where   they   would   provide   the   most   benefit.      A   maintenance  protocol  and  agreement  would  be  created  where  the  City's  role  could  be  to  provide  TDSB  

  

61  

   caretaking  staff  training  on  how  to  care  for  the  schoolyard  parks  to  PF&R  standards,  and  where  the  PF&R   could  also  provide  ongoing  maintenance  support  to  share  these  responsibilities.       Thirdly,   other   potential   partners   could   and   should   be   included   in   a   schoolyard   park   initiative.      Public- private   partnerships   were   established   in   all   of   the   reviewed   initiatives,   and   the   Canadian   Council   for   Public-Private  Partnerships  (2011)  argues  that  these  types  of  partnerships  are  an  important  funding  and   development   strategy   for   governments   across   all   jurisdictions   that   have   capital   projects   to   complete.     Two  schoolyard  greening  programs  have  already  established  partnerships  with  the  TDSB:  the  EcoSchools   program   that   was   developed   and   is   run   by   the   TDSB,   and   the   Toyota   Evergreen   Learning   Grounds   program.      Both   programs   have   years   of   experience   greening   TDSB   schoolyards   on   a   site-by-site   basis,   making  them  excellent  potential  partners  who  could  assist  with  the  design,  funding,  construction,  and/or   maintenance   of   the   schoolyard   parks.      Another   potential   partner   could   be   Canada's   first   citywide   park   organization  located  in  Toronto.    "Park  People"  is  an  independent  charity  that  supports  "community  parks   groups  [by]  bringing  them  together  with  city  staff,  funders,  businesses,  and  other  partners  to  host  events,   plant   more   trees   and   gardens,   build   new   infrastructure,   steward   volunteers,   and   transform   parks   into   dynamic   community   hubs"   (Park   People,   2015).      This   potential   private   sector   partner   could   mobilize   private  sector  funders  and  facilitate  community  involvement  in  projects.     Ultimately,  creating  a  multiagency  schoolyard  park  initiative  requires  a  shared  agreement  on  the  value  of   city-wide   schoolyard   parks,   a   city   park   goal,   alignment   of   interests   and   priorities   on   implementing   this   goal,  clarity  of  authority  and  partners,  and  on  going  acceptance  of  roles  and  responsibilities.    This  type  of   initiative  is  not  only  beneficial  to  students,  but  is  also  valuable  to  school  boards,  community  residents  and   the  City.      It  is  particularly  urgent  that  schoolyard  parks  be  established  before  underutilized  schools  are   deemed   surplus,   as   once   they   are   disposed   of   and   the   land   is   developed   for   other   purposes,   it   will   be   extremely   difficult   and   costly   to   acquire   the   land   again   for   open   green   space   purposes.      By   converting   underutilized   and   regular   TDSB   schoolyards   into   schoolyard   parks,   the   social   value   of   the   property   will   increase   due   to   the   many   benefits   it   would   provide   students,   the   community,   and   the   City,   making   it   much   more   difficult   for   the   Ministry   to   require   schoolyards   to   be   sold   in   the   future.      Green   spaces   are   prized   public   assets   and   the   ones   that   currently   exist   must   be   protected   and   maintained   to   benefit   generations  to  come.
