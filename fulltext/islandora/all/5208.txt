DIGITAL POTENTIALS FOR HEALTH:
A Public Symposium co-hosted by: News & Media Research Centre, University of Canberra Health Research Institute, University of Canberra

NARROWING THE DIVIDE
FRIDAY 13TH MAY 2016, 9:00AM - 3:00PM ANN HARDING CONFERENCE CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA
Registrations available via www.eventbrite.com.au/e/digital-potentials-for-health-narrowing-the-divide-tickets-24942943014

This symposium explores the promise of digital connectivity in the health context. In the hands of the individual, digital technologies have potential to improve health care and well-being of the user through self-management. However, those who experience poor health are often those who are not equipped with appropriate digital access and skills. Furthermore, health risks are largely correlated with social exclusion factors. The uneven distribution of digital health benefits may widen the already existing gap. The symposium is a springboard for inquiry: how we can enhance digital engagement in health? The purpose is to generate dialogue around digital inequalities in health in Australia and overseas, prioritise the policy agenda, and establish a long term network of stakeholders in the field. Embedding mobile and digital technologies in health has potential benefits of improving health outcomes, and realising efficiencies in health services. We invite academics from various disciplines, health practitioners, policymakers and users of digital health tools for an open discussion about how we can better implement and utilise digital technologies in health care and management. Speakers and moderators include: Sally Burford (News & Media Research Centre) Morris Carpenter (News & Media Research Centre) Girija Chetty (Health Research Institute) Deborah Davis (Health Research Institute) Paresh Dawda (Ochre Health) Leif Hanlen (Data61) Moyez Jiwa (University of Notre Dame Australia) Jee Young Lee (News & Media Research Centre) Deborah Lupton (News & Media Research Centre) Catherine Middleton (Ryerson University) Sora Park (News & Media Research Centre) Alison Verhoeven (AHHA)
