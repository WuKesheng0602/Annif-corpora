Assessing the Potential Use of Envision in the Sustainability Certification of Road Projects with Conservation Authorities in Ontario Master of Applied Science, 2017 Scott Robert Smith Environmental Applied Science and Management, Ryerson University

Abstract 
Conservation Authorities (CAs) in Ontario are challenged with improving the sustainability of road planning and design through their programs and policies under the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act (OEAA) and the CA Act. This study examines whether CAs should endorse the voluntary Envision Infrastructure Sustainability Rating System to supplement their roles under the OEAA and the CA Act and regulations. This study applied Envision to a sample of 13 municipal road projects through a standardized document review. It found that Envision was able to differentiate between more and less sustainable road projects, that award achievement required sustainable actions beyond those which are standard practice, and that Envision is appropriate to apply to road projects that are planned through the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment process of the OEAA. This study concludes that the Envision framework has the potential to significantly improve the sustainability of road projects and should be endorsed by CAs.

1    Introduction 
Conservation Authorities in Ontario are struggling to effectively advance sustainability in the planning and design of municipal road projects through their commenting role under the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act (OEAA) and their regulatory powers under the Conservation Authorities (CA) Act. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential use of the Envision Infrastructure Sustainability Rating System (ISRS) in the sustainability certification of road projects in Ontario, and the opportunity such a system presents for Ontario Conservation Authorities (CAs) in supplementing the OEAA and CA Act to improve the sustainability of the planning and design of road projects. ISRSs provide a framework to analyse and recognize infrastructure project performance relative to a set of specified process and implementation requirements (Clevenger, Ozbek, & Simpson, 2013). Envision is a voluntary ISRS that is applied during the planning and design phases of infrastructure projects to improve the sustainability of infrastructure projects through construction, operation and decommissioning (Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure [ISI] and the Zofnass Program for Sustainable Infrastructure [Zofnass], 2015). The demand for road projects is being driven by the significant population growth planned for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Areas (GTHA). For example, the population of Peel Region is anticipated to increase by 52.2% and Halton Region by 72% by 2041 (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2014). Municipalities are making investments in constructing and re-constructing infrastructure to support the development needed to accommodate this growth. Roads have the potential to significantly impact sustainability in their construction, operation, and decommissioning phases. Through their role as watershed-based natural resource management agencies in Ontario, CAs have program and policy interests in advancing sustainability in the planning, design, construction, operation, and decommissioning phases of roads. The OEAA and to a 1   

      lesser extent the CA Act, are `command and control'. Cox (2016) defines `command and control' as a highly centralized authoritative governance structure with a high degree of control. Webb (2007) notes one of the disadvantages of regulations is that there are few incentives to achieve more than the legal or minimum standards. Therefore, there is a benefit for CAs to explore a voluntary alternative motivating framework to encourage the advancement of the sustainable planning and design of roads to supplement the OEAA and the CA Act and regulations. This alternative motivating framework could be a 3rd party sustainability certification endorsed by CAs. Envision is an example of a 3rd party sustainability certification. As quasi-provincial agencies based on a model of municipal partnerships, CAs could play an important role in increasing both the awareness and use of Envision amongst municipalities in Ontario.

2    Research Questions and Objectives 
This study addresses four research questions: how does Envision recognize and quantify the sustainability of a project? What is the gap between current practices and the best practices criteria of Envision with respect to road projects? Does Envision differentiate between more and less sustainable projects? Should Envision be endorsed by CAs to supplement their commenting role under the OEAA and the CA Act and regulations? These research questions are supported by five research objectives. The objective derived from the first research question is: apply Envision to a sample set of road projects reviewed by a Conservation Authority (see Table 1). The objective derived from the second research questions is: understand the gap between current standard practice and the Envision framework. The objective derived from the third research question is: contrast categories and projects, including those that scored highest and lowest overall. The objective derived from the fourth research questions is critique the use of Envision in the advancement of sustainable municipal road design and planning in Ontario; and identify the implications of these for Municipalities and CAs.

3    Literature Review 
3.1    Conservation Authorities 
CAs in Ontario can trace their roots back to the naturalists, farmers, hunters, and anglers in the early 20th century concerned with drought, deforestation, soil erosion, and flooding (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority [TRCA], 2014). The Conservation Authorities Act of 1946 allowed municipalities to apply to create CAs to manage natural resources on a watershed basis (TRCA, 2014). The approach of allowing, but not mandating, the creation of CAs meant that all CA's created had local political support; the local municipality had to be willing to financially support the CA and to help run it through the board of the CA (Conservation Ontario, 2015). Hurricane Hazel came to Ontario in October of 1954. In Toronto 81 people died and thousands were homeless in the aftermath. Following Hurricane Hazel four CAs amalgamated to form the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) with a focus on flood control. Through to the 1970s, MTRCA, in partnership with other levels of government, ran a program of purchasing hazard flood hazard lands, building dams and reservoirs, engineering alterations to channels, and developing a flood warning system (TRCA, 2014). This engineered approach of the 1960s and 1970s shifted to a watershed-based, ecological approach in the 1980s with a focus on improving water quality (TRCA, 2014). CA roles have expanded over the decades to include: regulatory authority under the Conservation Authorities Act; representative of delegated Provincial Interest on natural hazards; public commenting body under both the Planning Act and the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act; resource management agency; provider of planning and EA services to municipalities through memoranda of understanding; and landowners (TRCA, 2014). The 6   

      programs of each CA are flexible and geared to the challenges and needs of the local watershed(s) in the specific CA (Conservation Ontario, 2015). CAs comment on various sustainability aspects of roads through their programs, policies and regulations. The Conservation Authorities Act was revised in 1990 to give CAs regulatory authority over development in hazard lands, floodplains and unstable slopes, including grading, new structures, and alterations to existing structures, and the alteration of watercourses (Conservation Authorities Act, 1990). The Conservation Authorities Act gave CAs the regulatory framework needed to more effectively comment on municipal EAs in the province, including roads. This change gave municipalities a strategic incentive to actively seek CA input to their EAs to resolve issues prior to seeking permits for development. In 2003 the Conservation Authorities Act was updated again to include the regulation of impacts to wetlands (Conservation Authorities Act, 2003). The foundations of the CA model are municipal-provincial partnerships, locally based initiatives, and the watershed as a planning unit (Shrubsole, 1996). Since the vast majority of the funding to CAs was cut by the provincial Conservative government in the late 1990s, CAs have had to develop much closer partnerships with municipalities to secure the funding to continue their programs. Additionally, CAs implement the Drinking Water Source Protection Program established under the Clean Water Act, 2006 (Conservation Ontario, n.d.a). Some CAs were grouped together to form ten source protection regions, while nine CAs function as stand along source protection areas (Conservation Ontario, 2017). Each source protection region and area implements at least one source protection plan (Conservation Ontario, n.d.a). Eighteen CAs also implement Risk Management Services under the Clean Water Act to implement source protection plan policies requiring risk management (Conservation Ontario, n.d.a).

7   

      CAs are municipally funded and supported, quasi-provincial resource management agencies with a flexible, broad mandate. This allows CAs to develop locally relevant programs and policies. CAs are therefore appropriate agencies to advocate for municipal support for the Envision ISRS.

3.2    Ontario Environmental Assessment Act 
Most municipal infrastructure projects, including roads, are subject to the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act (OEAA), first introduced in 1976. The OEAA applies to projects by provincial ministries and agencies, municipalities and public bodies, and some designated private sector undertakings (Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change [MOECC], 2014b). The purpose of the OEAA is to ensure that a chosen project has been assessed against alternatives and that the proponent shows, through a traceable, rational, and iterative process, that the chosen alternative is environmentally acceptable and needed to address the problem (Lindgren and Dunn, 2010). The class EA process was introduced informally within a few years of the introduction of the OEAA with the support of the MOECC1 and proponents (Environmental Commissioner of Ontario [ECO], 2008). The MOECC, other stakeholders, and proponents were concerned that the burden of time and resources of the full EA process on proponents would be too cumbersome and costly. They wanted to streamline the EA process for groups of similar projects while still meeting the requirements of the OEAA (ECO, 2008). The class environmental assessment was developed as a streamlined self-assessment process that applies to routine projects with predictable, mitigable environmental impacts (MOECC, 2014a).

                                                            
 In 2014 the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) changed to the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change  (MOECC). For consistency, the MOE will be referred to as the MOECC, even for events prior to 2014.

      Class EAs are now the dominant procedure for EAs in Ontario; by 1993 ninety percent of the undertakings subject to the OEAA were approved through a Class EA (ECO, 2008). According to the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario (2016) there were 1877 class environmental assessments active at some point between 2011 and 2015. There are eleven approved class EAs, which are also known as parent class EAs. Projects are effectively preapproved if they follow a class EA process (Lindgren & Dunn, 2010). Projects that proceed through the full EA process are referred to as Individual Environmental Assessments (IEAs). Under the streamlined class EA process, planning and consultation is proponent-driven with reduced MOECC oversight as compared to individual EAs (ECO, 2008). Proponents are required only to submit a Notice of Completion to the MOECC for each project (MEA, 2011). There is no need for project-specific approval by the MOECC under the OEAA for class EA projects (MEA, 2011). As the class EA is a self-assessment process, proponents are responsible for ensuring the planning process in the class EA is followed. However, MOECC staff are supposed to enforce compliance with the OEAA under section 38 of the Act (MEA, 2011). The risk for a streamlined, pre-approved process is that it can stifle innovation, encouraging proponents to meet the minimum standards and repeat proven approaches rather than provide innovative new approaches and solutions. The Municipal Engineer's Association has a class EA that captures most municipal infrastructure projects, including roads, storm sewers, watermains and sanitary sewers. In 1987, the MOECC approved two class EA documents created by the Municipal Engineer's Association: one for roads and one for water and wastewater projects, subject to a 5 year review (MOECC, 2014a). Class EAs were enabled through Regulation 334 (MEA, 2011). In 1993 the class EA documents were revised and their approval extended (MOECC, 2014a). The class EA process was entrenched in the OEAA in 1997 (Hanna, 2015). In 2000 the two class EAs for municipal infrastructure projects were consolidated to create the Municipal Class 9   

      Environmental Assessment (MCEA). Further amendments were made in 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2015 (MOECC, 2014a); however, the basic proponent-driven, pre-approval class EA process remains in place. As the vast majority of municipal roads projects fall under the MCEA process, the Envision ISRS was tested in this study against a set of roads projects that were planned under the MCEA process. The purpose of the OEAA, as stated in the Act is the "betterment of the people of...Ontario by providing for the protection, conservation and wise management in Ontario of the Environment" (Ontario, 2003, c. E.18, s. 2). However, Gibson (2013) summarizes the state of EAs in Canada as not being "broad, innovative or forward-looking enough to foster a deep commitment to sustainability objectives". EAs, particularly Class EAs, focus too much on mitigation, and not enough on impact avoidance; net impacts to the environment have been broadly accepted as the price of progress (Gibson, 2013). The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario (ECO), a frequent source of critiques of the OEAA, summarized the challenges in his 2008 report which stated that "we have lost the old vision for EA; a new vision is urgently needed" (ECO, 2008). The ECO (2014) report did not note any substantive changes by the MOECC to address concerns from its 2008 report, noting that the OEAA has not been reviewed since 2005 or had a major overhaul since 1997. The 2016 report of the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, chapter 3.06 on Environmental Assessments, includes written responses from the MOECC to the various recommendations of the report; based on the MOECC responses in the Auditor General's report, the MOECC is committed to examining alterations to the EA program within the existing legislative framework in the short-term and updates to the legislation in the long-term. As a `command and control' approach the OEAA is insufficient as a motivator to plan and design road projects in a manner that will ensure sustainable solutions are chosen. The alterations the MOECC is considering in the short-term may be insufficient to ensure the OEAA 10   

      supports sustainable road planning and design. Alternative motivating frameworks should be explored that can be implemented in conjunction with the OEAA.

3.3   Voluntary Environmental Initiatives 
The literature lacks a universal definition of `command and control' (Cox, 2016). As stated earlier Cox (2016) defines `command and control' as a highly centralized authoritative governance structure with a high degree of control. Much of the literature, including Kotchen (2013) and Webb (2007), labels all regulations as `command and control'. For consistency, `command and control' in this study is as per the definition of Cox (2016), while uses of `command and control' that refer to regulations will use the term regulations in this study. Kotchen (2013) describes three waves of environmental policy with the first being regulations, the second being market-based instruments, and the third being Voluntary Environmental Initiatives (VEIs). Webb (2007) notes that regulations have been the backbone of environmental management since the 1970s. However, Webb (2007) notes three main disadvantages of regulations: they are administratively intensive, they often create an adversarial relationship between regulators and the regulated, and there are few incentives to achieve more than the law. It is Webb's last critique that is explored in this study. The MCEA has most of the elements of `command and control' based on Cox (2016): it is applied to complex, poorly understood systems; local citizens are often disempowered; decision making power is centralized with municipalities; EAs are undertaken by technical professionals; the MCEA encourages standardized approaches to different problems; and the analysis is simplified and focused on a small number of goals without sufficient regard to tradeoffs. The CA Act and regulations have fewer of the elements of `command and control' and to a lesser degree, but still suffer from the critiques of regulations from Webb (2007). CAs are therefore challenged with influencing the sustainability of the planning and design of roads 11   

      through their commenting role under the OEAA and MCEA, and through their regulatory role under the CA Act. The term Voluntary Environmental Initiatives (VEIs), as used by Webb (2007), refers to all initiatives that a business takes to reduce or eliminate some environmental impact. ISRSs are akin to VEIs where the lower-tier government is acting like a business, undertaking initiatives that are generally beyond regulatory requirements. Webb (2007) notes the rise in the last two decades of market-based, environmental, non-governmental organization-driven (ENGO) certification programs, such as the Forest Stewardship Council, and the Marine Stewardship Council. Through these certification programs, ENGOs have become leaders in policy innovation (Webb, 2007). Similarly, Envision is a certification program that is attempting to drive policy innovation, and is being led by an NGO (the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure). It may be advantageous for CAs to advocate for and support their municipal partners in using Envision to supplement the OEAA, MCEA and CA Act and regulations.

3.4    Sustainability 
Although a much older term in the biological sciences, sustainability arose in the context of public decision making mainly in response to two problems: the gap in quality of life between rich and poor individuals and the degradation of biospheric systems (Gibson, 2006). Sustainable development was first used as a term in the 1980 World Conservation Strategy, published by The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the United Nations Environmental Program, and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, citing social, economic, and ecological factors (Moldan, Janouskova, & Hak, 2012). The Bruntland Report, Our Common Future, 1987, added intergenerational equity to the definition of sustainable development (Moldan et al., 2012). The now widely adopted three pillars approach, separating 12   

      sustainability into ecological, economic, and social factors, was formalized at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 (Moldan et al., 2012). Although the three pillars approach to sustainability is widely adopted in government and corporate sustainability policy in Canada, there is academic debate in the literature regarding its definition and application. Morelli, J. (2012) notes more than a decade of struggle with the definition and relevance of the term sustainability. Furthermore, Morelli, J (2012) notes a debate between whether there should be two pillars (ecological and social) or three pillars (ecological, social and economic). Hosseini and Kaneko (2012) note a fourth pillar: institutional. In contrast, Gibson (2006) challenges the appropriateness of a narrow definition of pillars on the basis that it encourages trade-offs between them. Samberg, Bassok, and Holman (2012) note that the biggest hurdles to improving the sustainability of transportation are the absence of universally accepted definitions of sustainability and of sustainable transportation and their associated goals and objectives. Recognizing this challenge, Bueno, Vassallo, & Cheung (2015) set out that a project can be considered sustainable if it provides economic development and meets the transportation needs of society while staying consistent with natural laws and human values. Furthermore, they added that any measure of sustainability must be sensitive to the local economic, social, and environmental context, and must examine the whole life cycle of the project (Bueno et al., 2015). According to Bueno et al. the life cycle of transportation projects includes the construction, maintenance, operation, and the end-of-life recycling and reuse stages (2015). This study does not rely on a definition of sustainability precise enough to identify whether a given project was sustainable. This study relies on an understanding of relative sustainability to identify improvements to sustainability within a project. The Envision criteria themselves create a comprehensive sustainability framework relevant to infrastructure, and were not tested in this study against any external definition or framework of sustainability. 13   

     

3.5    Sustainability Impacts of Roads 
Road construction, maintenance, and use could potentially have a significant negative effect on sustainability. For example, with respect to climate change, the construction industry constitutes 6% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. (Clevenger et al., 2013). Transportation accounted for 57 Megatons or 34% of Ontario's greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 (MOECC, 2015). One way to categorize the sustainability impacts of infrastructure is by the products, goods, and services provided; the operations, procedures, and practices through or by which it is provided; and the natural resources consumed (Andreas, G., Allen, J., Farley, L, Kao, J., and Mladenova, I., 2010). Another way to categorize sustainability impacts is by issues: the conservation of energy, water and materials; and the protection of the natural environment, health and safety, and human rights (International Federation of Consulting Engineers [FIDIC], 2013). The sustainability issues occur across the various project phases of construction, maintenance, operation, and the recycling/end of life stage (Bueno et al., 2015). The field of road ecology provides some specific impacts of roads on the natural environment. From the perspective of road ecology, the core functions of roads include: a habitat for populations of flora and fauna (especially invasive species), a source for fauna that thrive along the roadway as compared to the adjacent habitat (especially invasive species), a population sink where fauna suffer high mortality rates compared to populations in adjacent habitats, and a barrier where roads disrupt wildlife movements (Clevenger & Hujser, 2011). These functions are species and context specific. Roads have a relatively large impact on various aspects of sustainability, across all project phases. Therefore, if Envision is to improve the sustainability of infrastructure, it must improve the sustainability of road projects.

3.6    Infrastructure Sustainability Rating Systems 
As there are limitations to the sustainability of road project planned through the MCEA and the CA Act and regulations, an alternative motivating framework for sustainable infrastructure planning and design in Ontario may be required to improve the sustainability of road projects. ISRSs offer variations on similar alternative motivation frameworks. Clevenger et al. (2013) note that the majority of sustainable infrastructure ratings systems (ISRS) are exclusive to vertical infrastructure (buildings); horizontal infrastructure, especially roads, has been much slower in development and uptake. Many ISRS have been developed over the last decade, mostly in Europe and the United States, to meet the need to rate horizontal infrastructure. The International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) noted over 85 sustainable infrastructure tools, systems, logbooks, calculators, and guidelines as of 2013 for vertical and horizontal infrastructure (FIDIC, 2013). ISRSs apply various criteria, and often a score, which corresponds to an overall sustainability level. Many of the ISRSs have the option of third party verification that provides the proponent with an official certification. The various ISRSs developed are attempts to take a similar approach to infrastructure as has been done through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for buildings. Clevenger et al. (2013) found that all the ISRSs attempted to provide a framework to analyse and recognize project performance relative to a set of specified process and implementation requirements. The result is a score for each factor that is then weighted and aggregated across all factors to provide a single number that can be used to provide an overall sustainability score for the project (Association of Consulting Engineering Companies [ACEC], 2014). Muench, Armstrong, and Allen (2012) set out succinctly the appeal of ISRSs in that: (i) they provide a common metric for the entire range of sustainable solutions, (ii) they measure sustainability and thus make it manageable, (iii) they allow for straightforward communication of sustainability goals, efforts and achievement,

15   

      and (iv) they provide a reasonable context within which designers, contractors and materials suppliers can be innovative in their solutions. (p.4)

GreenRoads is an ISRS specific to road projects. GreenRoads is a collection of sustainability best practices for road design and construction (Anderson & Muench, 2013). GreenRoads has third party verification to provide one of four levels of certification for projects (Anderson & Muench, 2013). Based on the GreenRoads website (greenroads.org) as of December 21, 2015, five individuals across Canada, including one from Ontario, had taken the training to use the GreenRoads certification. Based on a web search, none of the five appeared to work for an engineering consulting firm. A later search of the GreenRoads website February 12, 2017 found no individuals in Canada registered as trained to use GreenRoads. Furthermore, the website as of February 12, 2016 shows one certified project in Canada with no other projects currently registered. Although there has been some attempt to bring GreenRoads to Canada, GreenRoads does not appear to be supported by any municipalities or consulting firms in Canada.

3.7    Envision 
No ISRS have been developed exclusively for Canada (Associate of Consulting Engineering Companies [ACEC], 2014). Developed in the U.S., Envision is an ISRS designed for use across the U.S. and Canada. Envision is the result of a partnership between the Zofnass Program for Sustainable Infrastructure at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). ISI is a not-for-profit organization with the goal of developing and maintaining a sustainability rating system for civil infrastructure, and was founded by the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC), the American Public Works Association (APWA), and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (ISI, 2015). ACEC represents engineers, architects, land surveyors and other 16   

      professionals from private industry throughout the United States with the goal of improving the business environment for their firms (American Council of Engineering Companies, n.d.). APWA is a not-for-profit organization that represents individuals, agencies, and corporations interested in public works and infrastructure issues in the United States and in Canada (American Public Works Association, n.d.). ASCE is a society that represents civil engineering professionals in 177 countries (American Society of Civil Engineers, n.d.). Envision was developed through a partnership of industry professionals and academics in the public, private and academic realms. The development of Envision was supported by an extensive textbook with input from a variety of academics and professionals that summarized the work in the Zofnas School of Design at Harvard University from 2008 through 2012 on developing the framework for ISRS (see Pollalis, S., Georgoulias, A., Ramos, S., and Daniel S., 2012); however, the development of Envision was not subject to formal peer reviewed papers, which may detract from its acceptance in academia. Nonetheless, the advantage of an ISRS with such wide ranging input is a greater buy in both private firms and government. Envision is designed to be applied to all types of infrastructure, including roads, through the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and decommissioning phases. An individual trained and credentialed in the use of Envision is known as an Envision Sustainability Professionals (Env SP) (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). There were 66 individuals registered as Envision sustainability professionals in Ontario according to the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI) website as January 29, 2017, up from 48 as of November 8, 2015, with the vast majority in consulting firms. Furthermore, as of January 29, 2017, the ISI website lists two projects awarded Envision certification in Canada: a wastewater treatment plant in Ontario and a road in B.C. Despite no projects having been awarded in Canada since 2015, momentum for Envision has had modest growth in the United States. According to the ISI website as of January 29,

17   

      2017, two projects were awarded in 2013, three in 2014, four in 2015, fourteen in 2016 and three as of January 29, 2017 (ISI, Project Awards, 2017). More importantly, a second road project was awarded in 2017 ­ the reconstruction of 21 miles of the I-4 highway in Florida (ISI, 2017a). The project includes the reconstruction of 15 interchanges, widening of 13 bridges, replacement of 74 bridges, and addition of 53 bridges (ISI, 2017a). The project achieved the highest Envision rating of Platinum (ISI, 2017a). Nevertheless, both road projects assessed are far larger in scale and scope than those assessed through the MCEA process in Ontario, so there is a significant gap in practice that this study addresses. Of particular note, on August 16, 2016 the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors instructed their Director of Public Works, Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Executive Officer to adopt Envision as a standard for infrastructure projects, including transportation projects (ISI, 2017b & Los Angeles County Department of Public Works [LACDPW], n.d.b). The City of Los Angeles, in collaboration with Los Angeles County, followed with a similar motion November 4, 2016 (ISI, 2016a). As of February 4, 2017, the Department of Public Works of Los Angeles County website lists two road projects assessed, but not verified. The first project is an expansion of an existing interchange, known as the Hasley I-5 Interchange Project, which was rated at 244 of 809 possible points or 30% for an achievement of Silver (LACDPW, n.d.b). The second project is the widening of an existing highway from 4 lanes to 6 lanes, known as the Old Road Widening, that achieved 164 of 809 possible points, or 20% for an achievement of Bronze (LACDPW, n.d.a). Envision is unique from other ISRSs in several aspects. It covers the entire project life cycle of planning, design, construction, operation, and decommissioning. Envision addresses traps and vulnerabilities anticipated from climate change, such as extreme weather, that could

18   

      result in higher costs down the road for a community (ACEC, 2014). The criteria score is progressive, giving relatively more points for performance that is well above the standard, to encourage innovation and the setting of aggressive objectives (ACEC, 2014). ACEC (2014) set out eight questions that are important for a consulting engineering firm to answer prior to using an ISRS and Envision rates well for these questions relative to other ISRSs. Of the ISRSs studied in their paper, Clevenger et al. (2013) found that Envision allocated the highest number of criteria to what they defined as environmental issues, the highest percentage of all subcriteria related to water quality, the highest percentage of sub-criteria related to energy, and a close second highest percentage of sub-criteria for the selection of materials, as compared to the other ISRS they examined. Clevenger et al. (2013) also found that Envision applies to the widest range of infrastructure projects, requires that an Envision credentialed employee be on the project team, and is the only ISRS that awards points for effective and collaborative leadership from the project team. Bueno et al. (2015) rates Envision highly, but notes that it is not sensitive to the local context. This is a criticism common in the literature to many ISRSs. For Envision, aside from excluding criteria that are not relevant to the project, there is no process to adapt the criteria or to change the weighting to reflect local issues. The work of Lee, Edil, Benson, and Tinjum (2013) found that Envision, along with GreenRoads and three other ISRS, all suffer from a lack of objectivity in criteria selection and weighting. Furthermore, Lee et al. (2013) pondered whether in criterion-based certification systems achieving a certification may take precedence over achieving sustainability objectives. Envision does have a process to allow for bonus points for innovation, which many other ratings systems have, including GreenRoads, but the innovation bonus may not be sufficient to reflect local context. However, the lack of flexibility means that the expectations and metrics are specific and non-negotiable, setting out clear expectations that may be lacking in a regulatory approach. 19   

      Despite these challenges, it is important to note that Envision has the support of a number of consulting engineering companies in Ontario, based on the list of Envision Sustainability Professionals in Ontario on the ISI website. No other ISRS has the level of support that Envision has in Ontario, or in Canada. Given the aforementioned challenges in the existing `command and control' and regulatory approaches in Ontario, this study explores the benefits to CAs endorsing Envision.

4    Using Envision 
4.1    Project Evaluation 
The Env SP evaluates a project using the Envision document. Figures 1a and 1b are from the Envision document. Each credit has the two pages with the same information. Note that some of the terminologies from Envision were altered in this study to provide consistency with the accepted terms in the literature. Credits in Envision are referred to as criteria in this study. The Evaluation Criteria in Envision are referred to as the Performance Metrics in this study. The description "Metric" in Envision is not referenced in this study. The first step for the Env SP is to briefly review the Intent, the Description, and Advancing to Higher Achievement Levels to gain a general understanding of how what the criterion is attempting to achieve and how. The next step is to review the performance metrics, which are under the title Evaluation Criteria and Documentation in tables 1a and 1b. The performance metrics mostly ask polar questions with a yes-no answer, based upon qualitative and/or quantitative requirements. The four types of polar questions are: whether an action had been taken or an outcome achieved; whether a specified target had been reached which may involve discrete or variable levels; whether a process had been undertaken or a commitment made to meet a specific objective; or whether a process had been undertaken with a general accomplishment (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). The fifth type of question is a non-polar question of the extent to which the project team undertook an action or process (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). In the Envision document the performance metrics posit questions to the evaluator. The questions are a progression whereby the evaluator responds to the questions successively until the answer is negative. In the Envision document the performance metrics provide examples of 21   

      documentation that can be used to support the accomplishment of the metric. The documents listed are intended to provide assistance to the evaluator and do not comprise a comprehensive list. The next step for the Env SP is to evaluate the Levels of Achievement. Each criterion contains two to five levels of achievement ­ improved, enhanced, superior, conserving, and restorative. As shown in Figure 1a, the criterion QL 1.1 has all five levels of achievement available. Similar to the performance metrics, the levels of achievement are progressive, requiring that a lower level of achievement be met before consideration is given to the next level. So the first step is to determine which levels of achievement are valid for the project based on the performance metrics met. In Figure 1a, the first three levels of achievement (Improved, Enhanced and Superior) require that the performance metrics A through D be met. The next level of Conserving requires that performance metrics A through E be met. The evaluator then assesses the project based upon the descriptions of the levels of achievement, starting with the lowest level of achievement. For example, for a project to achieve a rating of Enhanced for criterion QL 1.1, it must meet performance metrics A through D, and meet the description of achievement level Improved and achievement level Enhanced.

4.2    Project Verification 
The Envision rating system and tools are available free on the ISI website. Certification is only one use of Envision. ISI recognizes and supports many other uses of envision: as a communication tool with stakeholders, to prioritize a list of projects, to assess project alternatives, as a communication tool with the project team, to identify sustainability priorities, to quantify the value of sustainable practices, to evaluate project performance, and to recognize achievement (ISI, n.d.c). The process of verifying a project is illustrated in Figure 2. Verification is optional and is provided as a way of increasing awareness of Envision and of motivating its use and higher achievement. The verification process starts with pre-registration whereby the project team, which must include an ENV SP, undertakes a self-assessment to understand whether the project is likely to achieve an award (ISI, n.d.c). The second step is registration whereby the ENV SP registers the project online with ISI, and ISI assigns a verifier; the ENV SP and the verifier then have a conference call to discuss the project and the Envision process (ISI, n.d.c). The third step is assessment whereby the ENV SP submits their assessment of the project using the online tool, along with the required documentation (ISI, n.d.c). The fourth step is verification, which can involve up to two chances to re-submit the assessment in response to comments from the verifier (ISI, Module 7, 2016). The last step is award whereby, if the project has achieved at least 20% of the available criteria, the project receives an award and plaque at a ceremony, with a press release (ISI, n.d.c). Los Angeles County has endorsed Envision as official policy, but only verifies select projects. Los Angeles County staff undertake a self-assessment of their infrastructure projects and provide a brief summary of achievement under each of the five categories of Envision on their

25   

      website. The verification process increases the costs of a project both directly through the fee and indirectly through the requirement of additional documentation. CAs could endorse Envision and encourage and support municipalities in adopting it as policy, similar to Los Angeles County, which avoids the costs of verification.

Figure 2 Table 2 shows the 55 criteria of Envision under the categories of Quality of Life (QL), Leadership (LD), Resource Allocation (RA), Natural World (NW), and Climate and Risk (CR) (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Each criterion has one or more levels of achievement, listed in increasing order as: Improved, Enhanced, Superior, Conserving, and Restorative (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). The levels of achievement are based upon a set of clear and detailed evaluation metrics (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Each of the levels of achievement has points weighted based upon an assessment by ISI and Zofnass of the relative contribution of the criterion and level of achievement towards sustainability (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). As illustrated in Table 2, criteria and 26   

      categories of criteria have different maximum points. Criteria can be omitted by a proponent if they are not applicable to the project, but the weighting cannot be altered (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). To encourage innovation, bonus points can be awarded where a project exceeds criterion requirements or uses an innovative method, application, or technology, as judged by the Envision Sustainability Professional and confirmed by the verified (ISI & Zofnass, 2015).

5    Supporting Research 
This study adapts the approach of Anderson and Muench (2013). They undertook a study to measure sustainability trends in the U.S. using the GreenRoads rating system. Their study purpose was to understand the potential impact of the GreenRoads ratings system, or a similar system, on the U.S. transportation industry. This followed earlier research by Anderson. She took a pool of 40 projects she identified as sustainable and 65 projects she identified as typical (Anderson, 2012). The sample was not random, and required that the projects have available documentation and a representative from the project team available for an interview. Anderson's study team analysed each project through available reports, websites, and interviews and assigned a GreenRoads score based upon activities of the project that met the intention of the criteria. The study team gave a raw score based on a strict application of the GreenRoads criteria and a reasonable score that included the `low fruit' the team defined as having low or no additional cost to the project. They then analysed trends between criteria categories and between the prior identified typical versus sustainable projects. This study took a similar approach to studying the Envision ISRS in Ontario, adapting their purpose, research questions, study objectives, and methodology. However, it was beyond the scope of this study to pre-identify project as sustainable, and to include interviews. Furthermore, this study assesses the findings of Saville, Miller, and Brumbelow (2016) in their assessment of the Twin Oaks Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project using Envision. The authors came to five findings: the sustainable nature of the project itself was not directly addressed, there was no weighting of criteria based upon local needs, the project focus omitted a system scale, there was an uneven weighting of the three sustainability pillars, and that the positive scoring often overlooked negative aspects of the project (Saville et al., 2016). This

29   

      study investigates whether these conclusions held true for the 13 municipal transportation projects assessed.

6    Method 
6.1    Selection of Cases 
The first part of the research method was to select the cases for assessment. Through my employment at TRCA I had access to project files of reports and drawings covering the Environmental Assessment and detailed design for road projects within TRCA's jurisdiction that required a permit under Ontario Regulation 166/06. Ontario Regulation 16/06 is TRCA's regulation of development under the CA Act. The first step was to compile a list of all permits issued by TRCA under the CA Act that were associated with a schedule C MCEA for road works; most of the projects widened an existing road. The next step was to identify the associated list of EAs. Each EA was checked to ensure that each had been carried through to detailed design for the entire preferred solution of the EA. Projects where more than two permits were generally associated with the EA were excluded due to associated complexities when assessing the project. Projects that did not have a potential environmental impact on at least one watercourse or wetland were excluded. Projects deemed too difficult to assess, or too similar to another case study were excluded.

6.2    Document Review Method 
6.2.1    Spreadsheet 
Envision requires that each project be evaluated using the Envision ISRS. This study used a systematic approach developed for making post hoc subjective judgments about project performance using Envision. Table 3 is a simplified example of the spreadsheet for one criterion. The 13 projects each have their own worksheet with one row for each of the 55 Envision criteria. Each criterion has between one and six performance metrics, A through F. An 31   

      explanation of the achievement for each applicable performance metric for each project is provided in Appendix A; each applicable performance metric was given a level of confidence of it being met ­ generally no, maybe, likely, or yes. The next columns summarizes the metrics met, separated into base and upper levels of confidence (explained below). The next columns provide the criterion level of achievement and associated score, separated into base, upper and `low fruit' scores (explained below). `Low fruit score' is a subjective rating that is intended to capture relatively low cost, relatively easily actions that could have been implemented. The final column contains an explanation of the scores given for each criterion. Example Assessment Worksheet:

6.2.2    Perspective 
I completed a series of online training modules and a final exam online through ISI in early 2016. Along with my work experience in reviewing Environmental Assessments and detailed design for infrastructure, I qualified as a Certified Envison Sustainability Professional (Env SP) and am listed on the ISI website. Each project was assessed from the perspective of the Env SP on the team. To maintain consistency in approach, and thereby minimize bias, claims in the file documentation were not critiqued. Similarly, comments from Conservation Authority Staff in the file were not reviewed.

32   

      Generally only the final Environmental Study Report and appendices, detailed design technical reports, memorandums, and final detailed design drawings were reviewed. Landscape images were used to gain a general understanding of the context of the road. Grade level images were used if available post-construction to check what was actually constructed.

6.2.3    Evaluation Methods 
Projects were assessed one at a time. Each of the performance metrics has a one sentence description and then lists examples of documentation that would prove the metric was met. For each criterion in this study, the performance metrics were assessed sequentially to identify the performance metrics that in my opinion were met with a high degree of confidence (base metric met) and then with a lower degree of confidence (upper metric met). If a metric was clearly not met based on the assessment for the upper metric met, further metrics were assessed only if it would provide useful information in assessing the `low fruit' score. The `base metric met' is the metric that, with a high degree of confidence, the project would have achieved. As projects completed with no knowledge of Envision were assessed, a high degree of latitude was applied in assessing whether the project met the specific examples of support for each performance metric, and some latitude in assessing whether the project met the core purpose of each criterion itself. The `upper metric met' is the performance metric that was met with a lower threshold of confidence. A higher degree of latitude was used in interpreting each performance metric in the upper metric met as compared to the base metric met. This includes situations where there are two interpretations of a metric and, where one interpretation leads to meeting the metric and the other to not meeting the metric, the upper evaluation criteria will list the metric as met.

33   

      The level of achievement was strictly assessed; all aspects of the description for a given level had to be met for achievement to be given. The criterion was then given the score associated with the level of achievement. The `base' level of achievement is the level of achievement that clearly met the required achievement descriptions and associated performance metrics, preferably with written evidence or a high degree of certainty based upon knowledge of standard practice. The `upper' level of achievement' is the higher level of achievement met with a lower level of confidence. For example, in instances where there was a lack of clarity on how to interpret and apply the level of achievement, the highly certain achievement was the base achievement while the less certain achievement was the upper. `Low fruit' is a phrase borrowed from the supporting research of Anderson and Muench (2013) and is short for `low hanging fruit'. The `low fruit' level of achievement is a subjective rating that is intended to capture relatively low cost, relatively easy actions that most likely would have been implemented had an Env SP been on the project team from the beginning. The `low fruit' score only included actions that did not require significant revisions to the preferred design. The `low fruit' judgement is project specific, based upon the levels of achievement already undertaken. The notes for each criterion include the reasoning for the `low fruit' score given.

6.3    Interpretations, Inferences and Assumptions 
Envision was designed to be used for all types of infrastructure. This required the Envision document to use terms and processes that could be broadly interpreted for linear surface infrastructure, linear underground infrastructure, and site plans. Some terms and processes were more relevant to underground infrastructure or site plans, and their interpretation for roads was unclear. There were many examples of inconsistencies between the 34   

      performance metrics and the descriptions for the levels of achievement; for example, sometimes one of the performance metrics required for the lowest achievement level of Improved was a stricter test than the description of the Improved level of achievement. Key aspects of the systematic approach of this study were assumptions and interpretations, which improved the consistency of project ratings. Envision was designed to be used during planning and design and some of the process and implementation metrics of the document are very specific. As all projects assessed in this study have already been through planning and design, a degree of latitude in interpreting project metrics was used. Interpretations and inferences were made to support a consistent approach in assessing project metrics. The key interpretations and inferences are laid out below. Further, less importation interpretations and inferences are described in each of the project assessment work sheets for each criterion. The project sheets also provide descriptions of assumptions that were made, especially where documentation was absent.

6.3.1    General 
In the training to become an Env SP, the rule of thumb provided was that a maximum of three of the 55 criteria can be deemed not applicable. Therefore, only criteria that were completely irrelevant were deemed not applicable. Criteria that would not have been appropriate for a project to pursue were not excluded; for example many projects were adjacent to farmland that was in various stages of planning approvals for development. Although it would have made little sense to assess and protect farmland slated for development as per criterion NW 1.3, criterion NW 1.3 was only excluded where the project was not adjacent to any currently farmed lands. Each of the five categories of criteria has a bonus criterion for innovation or exceeding criterion requirements. There is no clear method in the Envision document to systematically 35   

      assess the degree of innovation or exceedance of criterion metrics required for achievement. Achievement is on a case by case basis under the discretion of the Envision verifier. It was beyond the scope of this study to develop a systematic approach to assessing the exceedance of criterion metrics, and was not necessary to answering the research questions and objectives. Therefore, the five bonus criterion of innovation or exceeding project requirements were assumed to be 0 and were not included on the project assessment worksheets.

6.3.2    Criterion Specific Interpretations 
1. The intent of criterion QL 1.1: Improve Community Quality of Life is to "improve the net quality of life of all communities affected by the project and mitigate negative impacts to communities" (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). The intent aligns with one of the key intents of the OEAA and as such it is one of the most important criteria in Envision for the projects assessed in this study which were all planned under the OEAA. It was also one of the more complex criteria to interpret with no clear definitions of key concepts and terms, such as `meaningful stakeholder engagement', and the difference between the `host community' and `nearby affected communities'. Community was interpreted to be the local municipality. Therefore the `host community' was the municipality in which the project was occurring and `nearby affected communities' were the adjacent municipalities. Therefore, the relevant local community plans included the Official Plan and infrastructure Master Plans. The criterion description states: "If the project team can show that the affected community (or communities) has an existing project assessment and approval process that verifies that the project is in concert with community goals and objectives and that the project has gone through that process successfully, then that success will constitute achievement of this [criterion]. The level of achievement will be determined by the project team and is a function of the comprehensiveness of the process, the extent to which community stakeholders are engaged in collaborative dialogue (rather than merely outside input to the process), and the degree to which 36   

      improvements were made and/or adverse impacts mitigated." (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). As Transportation Master Plans do not obtain local community input for every road improvement proposed, I deduced that the criterion requires that the project team for an EA verify through project level consultation, the recommendations from the higher level plans. As the lowest achievement level of Improved required satisfying performance metrics A through D, then the above test was read and understood along with metrics A through D. Performance metric D asks "have the affected communities been meaningfully engaged in the project design process?" (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). All projects assessed, with the exceptions of Main Street Markham and Leslie Street, used the standard two Public Information Centres (PICs) with information boards. Therefore, achievement of Improved or higher must prove that the standard two PICs of the MCEA process are sufficient to meet the criterion D test of meaningful engagement. If meaningful engagement is understood to mean collaborative dialogue as per the above quote then a meeting with information boards generally did not suffice; I therefore inferred a base score of 0 for all project with the exception of Main Street Markham and Leslie Street for criterion QL 1.1. However, based on my work experience some degree of meaningful engagement can still occur in projects that held public meetings with information boards. I therefore inferred that a degree of meaningful engagement may have occurred in projects with some of the following: a list or summary of comments received from the community with responses that show the comments were appropriately considered by the project team, and separate meetings with landowners or other key community stakeholders. To achieve the level of Enhanced required a project team undertake meaningful alterations to the project design as a result of input from the public or stakeholders, but some adverse impacts could remain. To achieve the level of Superior 37   

      required all potential impacts be reduced or eliminated and that the project align with the higher order plans and other community plans. To achieve the level of Conserving required meaningful stakeholder input at which was inferred to include facilitated public meetings, design charrettes, stakeholder advisory groups, and evidence of community endorsement. 2. The intent of criterion QL 2.5 is to "improve accessibility to non-motorized transportation and public transit...[p]romote alternative transportation and reduce congestion." (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Performance metric B requires that the project restrict the parking of motorized vehicles. I deduced that because the metric does not specify intent that a project meets the metric if parking is restricted irrespective of whether this is a deliberate design choices or a result of other design choice (such as the addition of curbs). Furthermore, the lowest achievement level of Improved requires encouraging the use of non-motorized transportation. It was unclear the relevance of whether the project also encouraged motorized transportation. Most projects assessed added general purpose motorized travel lanes. As the criteria and levels of achievement speak to increasing use of alternative modes of transportation, and not in shifting modal split, I deduced that the project's impacts on vehicular use is irrelevant. 3. The intent of criterion QL 3.3 is to "improve public spaces...to enhance community livability" (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Performance metric A requires that the project add to public space, but it was not clear what constituted an addition to public space. I deduced that because the first four levels of achievement only described improvements to public space, and all required achievement of performance metric A, that therefore `addition' to public space in metric A included improvements to the existing public space. 4. The intent of criterion NW 1.4 is to "avoid development on adverse geologic formations" (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). It is unclear at what geographic scale a criteria needs to not be

38   

      applicable in order to exclude it from the ratings. As per the Ontario Geological Survey (2008) there are no Karst formations in the GTA area. There are also no major earthquake fault lines or low lying coast areas in the GTA. I therefore conclusion criterion NW 1.4 was not applicable for any of the 13 projects assessed. 5. The intent of criterion NW 1.7 is to located projects on greyfields as opposed to greenfields (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Metric A asked what percentage of the project was located on a site that was previously developed. Strictly speaking, 50% of a project that reconstructs a road and doubles its width is located on a site that was previously developed. The Enhanced level of achievement is given for locating 50% of the project on a greyfield. For the purposes of this criterion it only made sense to count an existing road as a greyfield if serious consideration was given in the planning stages to a new road route through a greenfield. Otherwise, a project that doubles the width of an existing road would be given achievement for 50% greyfield development, which is absurd, and clearly not the intent of the criterion. 6. The intent of criterion NW 2.1 is to "minimize the impact of infrastructure on stormwater runoff quantity and quality" (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). The levels of achievement provide targets as a percentage improvement over existing conditions for greyfield, brownfield and greenfield development. For the purposes of water quantity calculations the existing road was considered a greyfield. Criterion NW 2.1 requires that water storage capacity be maintained in the greenfield and must be improved in the greyfield (existing road) by at least 30% for an Enhanced achievement level. Therefore, a road widening project that is 50% greyfield and 50% greenfield must overall improve water storage and infiltration 65% over pre-development conditions for the Enhanced achievement level. 7. The Climate and Risk category contains 7 criteria under the sub-categories of Emissions and Resilience. All the criteria required studies for which there was no evidence in the

39   

      documents reviewed, so all 31 projects reviewed were assessed at scores of 0 for the base and upper levels of confidence. Without some degree of achievement, it was very difficult to assess what would constitute low cost, easy actions that a proponent would likely have undertaken had an Env SP been on the team. Therefore a `low fruit' score of 0 was applied to all 7 criteria for all projects.

6.4    Control of Bias 
  Controlling bias throughout the project assessments was crucial in the support of data

validity. Several approaches were used. While projects were assessed one at a time, the assessment of each criterion was preceded by a review of the previous assessments of that criterion. Ongoing notes were taken during the assessments of deductions and assumptions made as to the interpretation of criterion and metrics. Once all the projects and criterion were assessed, a careful review of each criterion and the notes were undertaken across the projects to ensure that a consistent approach was taken. Taking the perspective of the Env SP on the team and not critiquing the claims of the documentation further ensured consistency and the control of bias.

7    Analysis 
7.1    Overall Summary 
Tables 4a, 3b and 3c illustrate the base, upper and `low fruit' scores achieved for each criterion under each of the thirteen projects assessed. The Climate and Risk category was not included as all criterion achievements were assessed at 0. Criteria that were deemed not applicable are illustrated with an N/A; the Torbram Road Grade Separation had the greater number of criteria deemed not applicable at five, followed by Kirkhams Road at four; however, Kirkhams Road had the lowest applicable total score. The other projects had either two or three criteria deemed not applicable. Envision scoring is based on the percentage achievement of the applicable total scores. The lowest achievement is Bronze at 20%. Tables 4a, 3b and 3c provide at the bottom of the columns the percentage of applicable total scores achieved. The highest base score achievement was Leslie Street at 14.4%, 5.6% less than the 20% required for a Bronze recognition. The lowest base score was Bloomington Road at 3.5%. The highest upper score was 19.9% for Main Street Markham; assuming the score is rounded up to 20% Main Street Markham was the only project that may have achieved an Envision award. When considering the more subjective assessment of the `low fruit' score, four project achieved the level of Bronze (Bayview Avenue, The Gore Road, Kirkhams Road, and Leslie Street), and Main Street Markham could have achieved Silver. The sum of the possible points differs for each of the five categories of criteria - Quality of Life, Leadership, Resource Allocation, Natural World, and Climate and Risk. To provide an overall summary Table 5 and Figure 3 show the mean base and upper scores achieved for each

Table 4b 43   

     

Table 4c 44   

      of the five categories of criteria for all 13 projects assessed. The maximum score for the category is the sum of maximum possible points for each criterion of the category (see Table 2). The Applicable Score is the maximum possible points minus the criteria that are not applicable. In Table 5 and Figure 3, the Mean Applicable Score is the mean of the Applicable Scores by category. The last column in Table 5 shows the mean Applicable Scores by category as a percentage of the `Overall Scores' per category. For the more conservative base score assessment, all projects scored zero on Climate and Risk, followed by Resource Allocation at 4%, Quality of Life at 6.5%, Leadership at 8.1% and Natural World at 21.0%. For the upper score, the next three are close at 10 to 11%, and Natural World remains the highest score at 24.8% of applicable points. Summary Analysis of Criteria Categories:

      Comparison of Applicable Scores by Category:

Figure 3

Table 6 illustrates variation through the deviation of the mean base and upper scores about the mean. The population calculation of the standard deviation was used as the 13 projects were not a statistically significant sample of a larger population. In Table 6, any standard deviation or mean larger than 3 is highlighted. As with Tables 4a, 3b and 3c, the seven criteria of the Climate and Risk category are not shown because all scores were 0. Twenty of the total of 55 criteria were assessed at 0 for the base and upper scores for all projects, shown as a mean of 0 with no standard deviation. The last column of Table 6 is the coefficient of variation which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. The coefficient of variation is one tool for comparing the variability between criteria. It is also a tool for testing the validity of the mean whereby the higher the

46   

      Project Score Variation:

Table 6

47   

      coefficient of variation, the lower the validity of the mean. The coefficient of variation is dimensionless, so it must be interpreted along with the mean as a high coefficient of variation could be due to a low mean.

7.2    Quality of Life 
Under the Quality of Life category Table 6, criterion QL 1.1: Improve Community Quality of Life had the highest standard deviation at 9.0, around the highest mean of 3.8 for the base score and 6.2 for the upper score. However, Tables 4a, 3b and 3c reveal that for 11 of 13 projects the base score for criterion QL 1.1 was 0, while two projects (Leslie Street and Main Street Markham) were rated at a base score of 25. So the variation in the base score for criterion QL 1.1 can be attributed to two projects. Criterion QL 2.4: Improve Community Mobility and Access appears to show some meaningful variation in Table 6. However, similar to criterion QL 1.1, an examination of the individual project score in Tables 4a, 3b and 3c reveals that 11 projects scored 0 or 1, while one project scored 4 and one scored 14. Criterion QL 3.1: Preserve Historic and Cultural Resources repeats the pattern with only two projects pulling up the mean and standard deviation. The scores for the remaining criteria under the Quality of Life category are all low with a relatively low standard deviation. Overall, Table 6 shows that the scores in the Quality of Life category had the greatest variability as compared to the other categories. The overall coefficient of variation for the category was calculated based on the mean of the base and upper scores for the 13 projects. The coefficient of variation was calculated to be 1.4 for the base score and 1.2 for the upper score, about means of 11.8 and 18.8 respectively. By comparison, the coefficient of variation is between 0.2 and 0.4 for the other categories (with the exception of Climate and Risk for which

48   

      the coefficient of variation cannot be calculated due to a mean of 0). Table 7 shows the median to be less than the mean at 5.0 and 6.0 for the base and upper scores, respectively. Tables 4a, 3b and 3c reveal that the high variability and the mean being much higher than the median are a result of most criteria in the Quality of Life category achieving very low scores of 0 or 1, with a small number achieving relatively higher scores of 14, 16 or 25, with a few scores in between. Mean and Median Category Score Comparison:

Table 7

7.3    Leadership 
There are 9 criteria under the Leadership category. Overall, Table 6 reveals low variability for the Leadership category as compared with the Quality of Life category with a coefficient of variability of 0.4 for the base score and 0.2 for the upper scores around means of 9.8 and 13.3 respectively. Table 7 reveals a median of 7.0 and 14.0 for the base and upper scores respectively. The only criterion under the Leadership category with a mean and standard deviation greater than 1.6 is LD 1.4: Provide for Stakeholder Involvement. The base standard deviation was 3.0 with a mean of 3.0 as shown in Table 6. Tables 4a, 3b and 3c reveal that all thirteen projects scored 1, 5 or 9 so criterion LD 1.4 does contain meaningful variation with all projects attaining some level of achievement.

49   

      The remaining criteria under the Leadership category, as shown in Table 6, show little or no variation about a relatively insignificant mean. For four of the 9 criteria in the Leadership category, no projects received any points.

7.4    Resource Allocation 
There are 13 criteria under the Resource Allocation category. Overall, the base score had the lowest variability based upon the coefficient of variation, at 0.2, as compared to the other category base scores (less the Climate and Risk Category). Table 6 shows that for 6 of 13 criteria all projects received a base and upper score of 0. Criterion RA 1.6: Reduce Excavated Materials Taken off Site has a standard deviation for the base sore of 1.6 about a mean of 5.7 for a relatively low coefficient of variation of 0.2. All other criteria have a standard deviation of 0 for the base score. For criteria where the coefficient of variation can be calculated, it is between 0.0 and 0.6, showing very little variation. The one coefficient of variation of 3.5 is a mathematical result of a low mean of 0.2 for the mean upper score for criterion RA 2.1: Reduce Energy Consumption. The low variability is also evident in Table 7 through medians for the base and upper scores of 7.0 and 18.0, within 0.3 and 0.5 of the mean, respectively.

7.5    Natural World 
There are 14 criteria under the Natural World category. Although there is relatively low variability of the category score between projects, the mean category score is far higher than the mean of the other categories. The coefficient of variation for the base and upper scores is 0.4, about a mean of 39.8 for the base score and 47.2 for the upper score. Figure 7 shows the median at 42.0 and 50.0 for the base and upper scores respectively. Four of the 14 criteria had mean base scores of between 5 and 14, which is far more than criteria in other categories. One criterion, NW 1.3: Preserve Wetlands and Habitat, was either not applicable or received a score 50   

      of 0 for all projects. Criterion NW 1.4: Avoid Adverse Geology was deemed not applicable for all projects. Therefore, 12 of the 14 criteria had some achievement in at least one project, more than the other four categories.

8    Discussion 
8.1    Gap Analysis 
Objective two is to understand the gap between current standard practice and the Envision framework. The gap analysis examines the gap for each category of criteria.

8.1.1    Quality of Life 
The Quality of Life category "addresses a project's impact on [the] host and affected communities, from the health and wellbeing of individuals to the wellbeing of the larger social fabric as a whole" (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). The analysis showed most projects achieved a very low score or no score at all for the 12 criteria in the Quality of Life Category. Higher achievement will be discussed through the three sub-categories of Purpose, Wellbeing, and Community. Criterion QL 1.1: Improve Community Quality Of Life, is a criterion that an EA under the OEAA should be expected to score well on as it broadly covers ensuring the project meets a social need and the social impacts are identified and mitigated. The Envision guideline lists 12 related criteria which would benefit from high achievement in criterion QL 1.1. Criterion QL 1.1 ties for the most related criteria. Higher achievement comes through meaningful community engagement through the identifying and addressing community needs, goals and plans, and mitigated community impacts with the participation of local community stakeholders. Most of the projects rated did not score highly or at all on criterion QL 1.1. Higher achievement through Envision requires that project teams think outside the box of two standard PIC meetings with information boards; for the second higher score of Conserving, the project team must prove the project has broad community endorsement which requires both a breadth of stakeholder

52   

      engagement and a depth (quality) of that engagement. The top score of Restorative requires that the project rehabilitate community assets. The vague definition of meaningful engagement in criterion QL 1.1 puts the onus on the project team in their Envision documentation to define and defend their engagement as meaningful. As discussed earlier, it is not clear in the documentation whether or how the engagement in Official Plans and Master Plans should be considered in the follow-up individual projects. It is also not clear the difference between the "host community" and the "nearby affected community" which are important distinctions regarding achievement levels regarding the geographic scope of the identification and mitigation of impacts. A municipality interested in Envision would likely need to have a project verified in order to clarify these terms. The next two criteria are: QL 1.2: Stimulate Sustainable Growth and Development, and QL 1.3: Develop Local Skills and Capabilities. Of the 13 projects assessed, Main Street Markham was assessed with an Upper score of Restorative for criterion QL 1.2. No other projects received a score for either criterion. At the moment, these two criteria are generally not considered in schedule C MCEA projects for road reconstruction. Envision does not allow criteria to be deemed not applicable because they are out of the scope of a project; Envision tries to push the envelope. However, its unlikely most projects in southern Ontario at the scale of road reconstruction and widening will spend time and money assessing their contributions to jobs (QL 1.2) or improvements to the skills of the local workforce (QL 1.3). Supporting and training a local workforce, especially one that is economically disadvantaged, is most relevant to large projects near isolated communities with high barriers to employment or limited opportunities, such as First Nations communities in Ontario's north. In the context of relatively simple and frequent road reconstruction jobs, the most that could possibly be done is for the municipality to include a preference towards contractors and sub-contractors that have a policy of hiring and training economically disadvantages workers in their tendering process. Even that 53   

      would only earn a score of 2; higher levels require a broader program in the project team to hire, support and train local workers/firms. The next 6 criteria all fit under the subcategory of Wellbeing: QL 2.1: Enhance Public Health and Safety, QL 2.2: Minimize Noise and Vibration, QL 2.3: Minimize Light Pollution, QL 2.4: Improve Community Mobility and Access, QL 2.5: Encourage Alternative Modes of Transportation, and QL 2.6: Improve Site Accessibility, Safety and Wayfinding. The 13 projects were given low or no scores generally for these 6 criteria. All six are related mostly to social benefits and impacts from the project. A score in criterion QL 2.1 can only be assessed and achieved if there is a new or nonstandard technology proposed that will require new health and safety plans and programs. Higher achievement in criterion QL 2.2 requires reducing noise and vibration to acceptable levels that "improve community livability". Generally, noise studies for road reconstruction projects show marginal increases in noise that are well below MTO thresholds for noise mitigation; municipalities will not want to spend money to mitigate marginal increases in noise so this criterion is not generally of much relevance to the types of projects assessed. Higher achievement in criterion QL 2.3 requires a lighting needs assessment with lighting zones, environmental design that limits light spillage from the road, and the use of energy efficient, dark sky preserving illumination. Higher achievement in criterion QL 2.4 would be highly correlated with criterion QL 1.1 through consultation regarding mobility with local facility operators, consultation with the local community about mobility during and post construction, and supporting the use of alternative modes of transportation. A project that has strong community consultation, improves walking and cycling infrastructure, and supports public transit, with detailed plans to maintain such access during construction, should score highly.

54   

      Higher achievement in criterion QL 2.5 requires the road accommodate walking and cycling infrastructure that's connected to larger network, support and encourages transit use through well-lit stops with shelters, secure bike lockers and real-time information. The absolute requirement of bike lockers in the third level of Superior may unnecessarily discourage further investments in encouraging alternative modes of transportation associated with the Superior, Conserving and Restorative achievement levels. While bike stalls are sometimes added along busy routes to bus stops, municipalities would likely find the cost and space required by bike lockers to be difficult to justify, limiting achievement to the second level of Enhanced. Achievement in criterion QL 2.6: Improve Site Accessibility, Safety, and Wayfinding was generally zero. The majority of the road projects assessed were designed as four or six lane arterial roads, and had low pedestrian and cycling traffic. It is difficult to imagine how wayfinding could be improved in a meaningful way for pedestrians in a street that lacks adjoining mixed uses that would encourage pedestrian use of the street. The next three criteria, falling under the Community sub-category, are QL 3.1: Preserve Historic and Cultural Resources, QL 3.2: Preserve Views and Local Character, and QL 3.3: Enhance Public Space. Achievement varied between the projects assessed ­ for many projects achievement was limited by the lack of opportunities presented in the project for achievement.

8.1.2    Leadership 
The Leadership category contains nine criteria, among three sub-categories. The criteria are mostly about how projects are delivered by the project team. There was generally little to no information in the project documentation related to the Leadership criteria, requiring more inferences and assumptions than was required for other categories. Higher achievement under the four criteria under the first sub category of collaboration require that sustainability be a core value of project proponents, that a sustainability 55   

      management system be established for the project, multi-disciplinary teams working through whole systems design processes, and that stakeholders be meaningfully involved in the design and decision making processes (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Higher achievement under the two criteria under the Management sub-category requires identifying and pursuing opportunities to use the by-products of nearby businesses in the project, and through integrating the project with other systems (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Higher achievement under the three criteria under the Planning sub category involves a comprehensive long-term monitoring and maintenance plan of channel works and other natural systems, identifying and addressing conflicting regulations, and designing a project to be more long-lasting and resilient (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Most of the criteria under the leadership category do not improve project sustainability on their own - they support sustainability thinking and solutions in criteria under the other four categories. It would be challenging to achieve highly in the other subject areas without high achievement in the Leadership category in support.

8.1.3    Resource Allocation 
The Resource Allocation category has thirteen criteria under three sub categories. Similar to the Leadership category, there was relatively little documentation to support achievement and a number of inferences and assumptions were required in the assessment of the thirteen projects. The Resource Allocation category contains 13 criteria under the three subcategories of: Materials, Energy and Water. The Materials sub-category contains 7 criteria. The first four criteria encourage proponents to connect associate the sustainability of their project with that of the inputs into the project. None of the project materials reviewed made any explicit reference to the impact of the materials on the sustainability of the project, which was expected; however, it is critical for

56   

      improving the sustainable outcome of projects that project teams broaden their perspectives and consider the sustainability of project inputs. The first criterion is RA 1.1: Reduce Net Embodied Energy. The goal of RA 1.1 is to reduce the net embodied energy of a project over the life of the project (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). All projects were assessed at 0 for RA 1.1 because all the metrics required a life cycle energy assessment, which none of the projects undertook. A project can realize efficiencies by undertaking a scoped Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of net embodied energy of project materials for criterion RA 1.1, of energy consumption during operation and maintenance for criterion RA 2.1, and of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions for criterion CR 1.1. The next criterion in the Materials sub-category is RA 1.2: Support Sustainable Procurement Practices. The metrics for RA 1.2 are based on the percentage of manufacturers and suppliers for a project that implement sustainable practices, which both higher percentages and more stringent definitions of sustainable practices associated with higher achievement. No EAs referenced sustainable procurement, so all 13 projects received scores of 0. The next four criteria are all similar. Criterion RA 1.3: Use Recycled Materials has metrics based on the percentage by weight or volume of recycled materials used during the project life cycle. Criterion RA 1.4: Use Regional Materials has metrics based on the percentage of materials sourced within specified distances of the project. Criterion RA 1.5 has metrics based on the percentage of materials during construction that are diverted from landfills over industry norms. Criterion RA 1.6: Reduce Excavated Materials Taken off Site has metrics based on the percentage of excavated materials suitable for reuse that are reused on site (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Criterion RA 1.7: Provide For Deconstruction and Recycling has metrics based on the percentage of components that can be easily reused or recycled at their end of life. While all 13 projects likely had some level of achievement for last first four criteria in the Materials sub-

57   

      category, none of the project documentation supported any achievement. To improve project sustainability, target achievements and supporting actions should be specified starting in the EA, and carried through detailed design and into project specifications. The next sub-category is Energy. The three criteria in the Energy sub-category are: RA 2.1: Reduce Energy Consumption, RA 2.2: Use Renewable Energy, and RA 2.3: Commission and Monitor Energy Systems. The criteria in the Energy sub-category are related to the energy used during the operation and maintenance phase. The majority of the energy used in road operation and maintenance is by the vehicles that use the road, over which the project team for a road reconstruction has no direct control. A relatively small amount of energy in operations and maintenance would be used by the road illumination; however, the project team has little control over whether or not the energy from the grid is renewable. These three criteria were therefore challenging to apply to the 13 road projects assessed and achievement was generally low or none. These criteria are more relevant to projects with a relatively larger energy consumption over which the project team has direct control such as a sewage pump station. Nonetheless, project teams do generally have control over illumination, and installing energy efficient illumination would provide for relatively easy scores in these criteria. The last three criteria of the Resource Allocation category fall under the Water subcategory. The intent of criterion RA 3.1 is to reduce impacts on the availability, quantity and quality of fresh water (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). The intent of RA 3.2 is to reduce the consumption of potable water and encourage the use of greywater, recycled water and stormwater (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). The intent of the third criterion RA 3.3 is to monitor the performance of water systems, but this credit was deemed not applicable to all projects assessed. Similar to the Energy sub-category, the criteria in the Water sub-category were difficult to apply to the road projects assessed, and the base and upper score achievement was 0 for all projects assessed. Road widening projects generally require little water during construction, operation and 58   

      maintenance. Achievement in RA 3.2: Reduce Potable Water Consumption could be through the Low Impact Development (LID) approach of directing some of the stormwater to watering boulevard trees to minimize the need to use potable water.

8.1.4    Natural World 
The Natural World category contains more criteria than the other four categories at 14. The three sub-categories are: Siting, Land and Water, and Biodiversity. The Natural World category also has the most available points as compared to the other four categories at 203. With the exception of Main Street Markham, the Natural World category was the highest achieving category for the projects assessed. The first seven criteria fall under the sub-category Siting. Achievement in the Siting subcategory was generally low because the projects assessed generally had little flexibility in their alignment. For many of the projects assessed, some of the criteria were deemed Not Applicable because the feature being preserved or avoided was not present. The `low fruit' score was generally the same as the upper score because of the limitations in adjusting the alignment. The Siting criteria are more relevant to new road alignments. The exception is criterion RA 1.5: Preserve Floodplain Function because the metrics allow achievement starting with a basic test of minimizing impacts to the floodplain function. All the projects assessed obtained permits from TRCA under Ontario Regulation 166/06 and one of the tests to obtain a permit is to avoid impacts to flood hydraulics based on the 100 year or Regional Flood, as appropriate. The next three criteria are under the sub-category Land & Water. The criterion is NW 2.1, which, as discussed previously, required an improved of 65% in water storage capacity over existing conditions for the lowest metric for a road that doubles in width. Achievement in NW 2.1 was 0 for all base scores and most of the upper and `low fruit' scores. Improving water storage capacity for new roads is crucial to avoid further degradation in our watersheds from

59   

      stream erosions due, especially in watersheds under pressure from urbanization. Achieving a 65% improvement would require planning starting in the EA to ensure sufficient property was obtained to add elements to the boulevard to store and infiltrate water, such as super pipes, and exfiltration LIDs, and exploring opportunities to coordinate with adjacent developments to direct road runoff to stormwater management ponds. The intent of NW 2.3 is to preserve groundwater quantity and quality (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Only Bayview Avenue included groundwater quality and quantity monitoring, due to the need for a sophisticated depressurization of an artesian aquifer to facilitate construction. None of the other projects achieved a base score in NW 2.3. Although infrastructure is generally exempt from the policies of the various Source Water Protection Plans in Ontario, the plans should nevertheless raise the awareness of the important of protecting Ontario's groundwater resources. Criterion NW 2.3 supports the voluntary policies of the Source Water Protection Plans with metrics that require groundwater quantity and quality monitoring, and spills prevention and response plans. The last sub-category is Biodiversity. The Biodiversity sub-category was the highest scoring sub-category of all fourteen Envision sub-categories for the base and upper scores for all 13 projects assessed in this study. Broadly, the four criteria relate to maintaining and improving natural system form and function. Achievement for the criterion in the Biodiversity sub-category may be higher than other sub-categories because each of the projects assessed had to obtain a permit under TRCA's Regulation under the Conservation Authorities Act. Through TRCA's policies and regulation, TRCA staff would have worked with the project teams through the EA and detailed design phases to minimize, mitigate and compensate for various impacts to natural system form and function. The only criterion under the Biodiversity subcategory where Envision is likely to motivate achievement much more than was already done is criterion NW 3.3: Restore Disturbed Soils. Soil disturbance, especially compaction, is a large 60   

      problem in road reconstruction projects; criterion NW 3.3 sets a high bar with the lowest metric requiring the restoration of 100% of soils disturbed during construction. While there was no documentation regarding soil restoration, because the metric set a high bar of achievement, it was assumed or inferred that none of the 13 projects assessed in this study achieved a score for criterion NW 3.3.

8.1.5    Climate and Risk 
The Climate and Risk category contains 7 criteria under the sub-categories of Emissions and Resilience. All projects received scores of 0 for the base, upper and `low fruit' scores for all 7 criteria. However, there is growing interest and expectations regarding the consideration of climate change mitigation and adaptation in infrastructure planning and design; 2016 provided many new and updated provincial documents emphasizing climate change mitigation and adaptation - the Climate Change Action Plan, the draft guidelines by the MOECC titled "Consideration of Climate Change in Environmental Assessments in Ontario," and the renewed emphasis on climate change in the draft four plans released in 2016 ­ the Growth Plan, the Greenbelt Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and the Niagara Escarpment Plan. The Envision guideline can provide much needed direction to municipalities on how to plan and design infrastructure that contributes less to climate change and is more resilient to the exacerbated stressors of climate change. The first criterion is CR: 1.1: Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions. CR 1.1 requires a proponent to undertake a life-cycle carbon assessment (LCCA). Recognizing that LCCAs are a new analysis that is rarely undertaken, Envision accepts a streamline LCCA that uses existing methodologies, focuses on the main contributors of emissions; measured, calculated or estimated data can be used. While some EAs recognize their relative contributions to carbon emissions through increased traffic, none of the EAs studied acknowledged the contributions of

61   

      the project to climate change during construction and decommissioning. It will be challenging for an EA to recognize and mitigate its contributions to climate change without the rigorous, defensible methodology of an LCCA. Furthermore, for the types of project being studied in this study, being mostly road widening projects, the methodology and data should be fairly similar between projects, allowing for efficiencies to be realized as LCCAs become a mainstream part of EAs. The draft guideline "Consideration of Climate Change in Environmental Assessments in Ontario" does include general descriptions of qualitative and quantitative assessments of a project's contributions to climate change (MOECC, 2016). Especially if the final document contains further details and stronger language encouraging qualitative assessments, and depending on the language of the next update to the MCEAA document LCCAs may become a more common part of EAs in Ontario. Furthermore, an LCCA is more efficiently done as part of a comprehensive LCA with an assessment of net embodied energy (RA 1.1) and energy consumption (RA 2.1). The next criterion is CR 1.2: Reduce Air Pollutant Emissions. This criterion pushes a project to meet California's Ambient Air Quality Standards then the South Coast Quality Management rules then a net zero and ultimately improved air quality (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). For projects that increase the number of general purpose lanes, there is little that can be done to control or improve air quality. The next five criteria are all related to increasing a project's resilience to the exacerbated stressors of climate change. Criterion CR 2.1: Assess Climate Threat requires that a project undertake a comprehensive climate impact assessment and adaptation plan that includes a vulnerability assessment, risk assessment and adaptation assessment (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). A number of resources already exist that some municipalities are starting to implement, including: the Building Adaptive and Resilient Communities (BARC) tool by ICLEA ­ Local Governments for Sustainability Canada, and the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee 62   

      (PIEVC) protocol. Criteria CR 2.2 to CR 2.4 each deals with aspects of the comprehensive climate impact assessment and adaptation plan of criterion CR 2.1. Criterion CR 2.2: Avoid Traps and Vulnerabilities, builds on criterion CR 2.1. Criterion CR 2.2 requires an assessment of the long-term traps and vulnerabilities. This criterion rewards the anticipation of three types of traps: resource traps, which are a dependence on resources that could become scarce; configuration traps, which are designs vulnerable to extreme weather events, natural disasters, and anticipated economic conditions; and standards traps, which is designing a project using standards and methodologies anticipated to change (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). Criterion CR 2.3: Prepare for Long-term Adaptability, builds further on criteria CR 2.1 and CR 2.2. Criterion CR 2.3 encourages a systems thinking approach to designing infrastructure to be resilient and adaptive; further achievement is given for rehabilitating existing impacts from climate change. Note that it is difficult to definitively prove cause and effect between climate change and a given impact; it is more appropriate to discuss impacts whose stressor is exacerbated by climate change. Criterion CR 2.4: Prepare For Short Term Hazards recognizes achievement for projects that undertake a hazards assessment for events with various return periods. Criterion CR 2.5: Manage Heat Island Effects is most relevant in urban areas where the heat island effect is most chronic. Achievement is given based on the percentage of surfaces that meet a solar reflectance index of 29 or higher (ISI & Zofnass, 2015). As the risks and vulnerabilities would be fairly similar between road projects in a municipality, it would be most efficient for a municipality to undertake such an assessment as a Strategic Environmental Assessment at the scale of the Region; the project level EA would then assess the risks and vulnerabilities relevant to the project and adapt the analysis as appropriate.

63   

      A single, comprehensive Regional scale assessment could cover criteria CR 2.1 to CR 2.4. Follow up EAs could then much more easily attain the higher Superior to Conserving levels of achievement in criteria CR 2.1 to CR 2.4. An achievement of Conserving in criteria CR 2.1 to 2.4 provides 64 points out of an average total number of applicable points of 782.3 based on the 13 projects assessed in this study.

8.2    Select Case Studies 
8.2.1    Bloomington Road 
The proponent was the Regional Municipality of York. The problem for the EA was to resolve anticipated traffic capacity constraints on Bloomington Road from Bathurst Street to Highway 404 (AECOM, 2011). The existing road was a two lane road with a rural cross section (AECOM, 2011). The preferred design was generally a widening to four lanes, with additional turning lanes in sections, from Bathurst Street to Highway 404 (AECOM, 2011). The design is a combination of urban and rural cross-sections. The EA was initiated in 2002, and the ESR was filed in 2004 (AECOM, 2011). The most significant natural heritage feature is a wetland complex bisected by Bloomington Road between Leslie Street and Highway 404. Bloomington Road widening from Yonge Street to Highway 404 has the lowest base score by far, at 3%. The next lowest is Sixteenth Avenue at 6%. Bloomington Road achieves the lowest or second lowest sum of base scores in every category. In the key category of Natural World, Bloomington Road achieves a total of only 11 points, second only to 16th Avenue at 19 points. The mean score for the Natural World criteria for all projects assessed is 40.5. Oddly, the third lowest sum of scores for the base score is Main Street Markham at 21. Despite the advanced landscape level analysis, at the detailed design stage of terrestrial movement and the installation of dedicated wildlife culverts and fencing where the road bisects 64   

      a Provincially Significant Wetland, the project scored very low overall. The lack of compensation for the lost wetland habitat prevented the project from claiming credit for the enhancements to wildlife passage in criteria NW 3.1 and NW 3.4, and the associated removal of peat prevented any achievement in criterion NW 3.3 and reduced achievement in criterion NW 3.4. As the low population density does not support public transit and there is little demand potential for pedestrian and cycling traffic, the road project impacted the available options for achievement in various Quality of Life criteria.

8.2.2    Kirkhams Road Bridge, Toronto 
The existing Kirkhams Road Bridge was constructed around 1955. It had deteriorated to the point where it was closed to vehicular traffic in 2005 (TSH, 2007). The bridge provided access to four residences, which now have access provided through a Toronto Zoo access road (TSH, 2007). The bridge supported a watermain that provided service to the four residences and to the Toronto Zoo (TSH, 2007). The stated purpose of the EA was an assessment of the existing and future transportation needs in the area of the Kirkhams Road Bridge to determine the future need for the bridge and to determine alternatives for the watermain currently supported by the bridge (TSH, 2007). Five alternatives to the undertaking were assessed: do nothing; close the Kirkhams Road and the bridge and relocate the watermain; rehabilitate the bridge; replace the bridge; and replace the bridge with a pedestrian bridge that would continue to support the watermain (TSH, 2007). The preferred solution was to close Kirkhams Road at either side of the bridge with a culde-sac and remove the bridge itself, provide gated access from the east cul-de-sac for maintenance to other existing infrastructure, and install the watermain under the Rouge River using a trenchless installation method (TSH, 2007). 65   

      The Kirkhams Road bridge project provided an interesting case study for sustainability assessment using Envision. There were a number of peculiarities with the Kirkhams Road study such that the project's sustainability was not accurately reflected in several criteria, reducing the overall score. The first example of inaccuracies is that despite a net decrease in impervious (paved) area by 500m^2, the project did have a couple of areas of expansion into the natural system at the cul-de-sacs and a maintenance road. Furthermore, a solid argument can be made that far more area was restored than was encroached into, and the encroachment was unavoidable. Nonetheless the project could not achieve a score in criterion NW 1.1: Preserve Prime Habitat; it did not matter whether the project provided a net gain to prime habitat as Envision did not allow any score in criterion NW 1.1 as long as the project encroached at any point into prime habitat. The project similarly lost the opportunity to score more points in criterion NW 1.2 Protect wetlands and Surface Water because the required maintenance road had to extend to with 65 feet of the watercourse, which was the metric of further achievement. Again, the extension in some areas into the Greenfield prevented points in criterion NW 1.7. The public was strongly opposed to the removal of the bridge without replacing it, voicing concerns on its recreational use by cyclists and safe egress in case of a local forest fire (TSH, 2007). As a result of community concerns, the project team added consideration of replacing the bridge with a cycling and pedestrian only bridge (TSH, 2007). Because Envision places a significant emphasis on `meaningful' public and stakeholder consultation (CR 1.1 and LD 1.4), and because Envision also has criteria related to access (QL 2.4), wayfinding (QL 2.6) and encouraging alternative modes of transportation (QL 2.5), the best Envision solution may have been the compromise of replacing the existing structure with a pedestrian and cycling only bridge structure. Envision does not consider cost, which was the main reason not to proceed with the pedestrian and cycling only bridge structure. The bridge structure would likely have allowed the project to still have a net decrease in paved surface area due to the reduced 66   

      footprint of the path and would have allowed the bridge abutments to be reconstructed further from the slope hazard; although the net improvements to the natural environment would be fewer, it would not reduce the Envision score over the removal option for the criteria in the natural environment category. For the Envision criteria related to the natural system, the project only needs to prove a net improvement to various system functions. If a higher Envision score would have gone to replacing the existing bridge with a longer bridge for pedestrians and cyclists, it is hard to discern if this would have been a more sustainable solution. The comparison between removing the bridge and the Envision preferred solution of replacing the bridge involves tradeoffs between the social, economic and natural environments. An assessment of the sustainability of the two solutions relies on the relative value placed on these `pillars'. The choice the proponents made was preferred for natural environment and financial factors while the Envision preferred solution scored higher on social factors. It should be noted that the Envision guideline does not consider the financial cost of solutions. While Envision clearly would have provided a higher score for an alternative that ultimately was not chosen, it cannot be determined with certainty which is the more sustainable solution. However, this project was chosen for study precisely because it represented a unique situation, and whether the higher scoring Envision alternative is the more sustainable solution is less relevant than it is for the other projects assessed which represent more common situations.

8.2.3    Leslie Street, Richmond Hill 
The EA proponent was the Regional Municipality of York. The EA was initiated in July 2005 (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The study purpose was to examine operational issues along Leslie Street from Bethesda Sideroad to Bloomington Road (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The EA examined a potential jog elimination at Bethesda Sideroad (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a).

67   

      Where Leslie Street is adjacent to Haynes Lake, issues included: steep road geometry, narrow pavement and minimal shoulders, high vehicular collision rates, high road maintenance costs, ice on the road, and regular flooding of the road in the spring (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The ice and flooding results from Berczy Creek backing up over the road due to minimal capacity in the road culvert and the low elevation of the road relative to the lake (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008b). The EA examined three distinct alternatives at Haynes Lake: relocate Leslie Street to the west around Haynes Lake, relocate Leslie Street further to the east from Haynes Lake, and reconstruct Leslie Street along its current alignment (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The western corridor alignment was eliminated early from consideration due to impacts to a wetland (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The eastern corridor was eliminated due to impacts to a landowner (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). It should be noted that the documentation supports that serious consideration was given to the two alternative solutions. It is rare for a road reconstruction EA to seriously consider alternative routes. The preferred alternative design was a reconstruction of Leslie Street that maintains the urban 2 lane cross section, with improved ditch drainage and paved road shoulders (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). Adjacent to Haynes Lake the road alignment will have reduced curves and safer geometry (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The road will be raised 3m above the Haynes Lake water level (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The equalization culvert will be increased in size. A large wildlife culvert and two smaller amphibian culverts will be added to connect Haynes Lake on the west side of the road with the wetland and watercourse on the east side of Leslie Street (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The road will shift slightly east of its current alignment, requiring the removal of wetland vegetation and peat 68   

      (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). Compensation planting will be provided on the west side of the new alignment (Dillon Consulting Ltd., & Ogilvie, Ogilvie & Company, 2008a). The Envision score for Leslie Street is compared and contrasted to Main Street Markham below.

8.2.4    Main Street Markham 
The City of Markham hired McCormick Rankin to initiate an Environmental Assessment for Main Street Markham from Highway 407 to Donald Cousens Parkway. The EA was initiated in February of 2008, and the ESR filed in 2010 (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). The existing Main Street Markham (formerly Highway 48) was a two lane urban road between Highway 407 and Highway 7, a 4 lane urban road between Highway 7 and 16th Avenue, and a 2 lane rural road from 16th Avenue to Major Mackenzie Drive (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). The section from Highway 7 to 16th Avenue is also known as Markham Village, and is a heritage conservation district with on street parking and lots of 19th and 20th century commercial buildings (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). The EA drew from several previous studies: Main Street Markham: a Vision for the New Millenium (1999), Main Street Markham Streetscape and Traffic Management Plan (2003), and Highway 48: 16th Avenue to Major Mackenzie Drive Urban Design Study (2005) (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). The problem and opportunity statement is "to address the existing and future needs of Main Street Markham to enhance community character, support commercial activities, respect and protect heritage, social and natural environmental features and address transportation needs within the study area" (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). A Community Advisory Group was formed that was comprised of members of various Markham heritage committees, ratepayers associations, and other interest groups. Seven

69   

      meetings were held with a professional facilitator(McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). Thorough summaries of all seven meetings were included in the final ESR. The project also held Public Information Centres (PICs). 105 people attended the first PIC, and 109 attended the second PIC (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). Again, summaries of comments received and responses were included in the ESR. The preferred alternative from Highway 407 to Highway 7 was to widen to three lanes (2 southbound and 1 northbound). The design avoided impacts to two buildings with heritage designations. A 3m multi-use pathway was provided and a gateway feature to Markham Village (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). The old bridge over the Rouge River was replaced with a 3 lane structure with a viewing platform (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). The preferred alternative from Highway 7 to 16th Avenue converted the outside 2 lanes to on street parking, reducing the road to 2 lanes (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). Various streetscaping improvements were made to improve the pedestrian experience. The preferred alternative from 16th Avenue to north of Major Mackenzie Drive was to widen to 4 lanes with a wide planted median (McCormick Rankin Corporation, 2010). The existing culvert at Mount Joy Creek was extended. The Envision score for Main Street Markham is compared to that of Leslie Street below.

8.2.5    16Th Avenue 
The proponent was the Regional Municipality of York. Both the EA and the detailed design were undertaken by iTrans Consulting Inc. The EA began in 2005 with a study area extending from Yonge Street to McCowan Road, then to York-Durham Line in 2006 (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). The EA was put on hold in 2008 at the request of the City of Markham as the City examined the need for 6 lane roads (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). Due to the deterioration of the 16th Avenue Bridge, the EA was split in 2008 and this project proceeded with 70   

      the reduced study area from Donald Cousens Parkway to the York Durham Line (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). The project purpose was to explore solutions to the deteriorating Bailey bridge that conveys 16th Avenue over the Little Rouge Creek, and future traffic, pedestrian and cycling capacity needs (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). The alternatives considered were: do nothing, operational improvements, jog elimination at Reesor Road and Bridge replacement, and the closure of 16th Avenue (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). The preferred alternative solution was to eliminate the jog at Reesor Road and construct a new four lane bridge above the Old Bailey Bridge; the Old Bailey Bridge was retained for a future trail system in Rouge Park (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). The first Public Information Centre held was prior to the project split so most of the public comments were not related to the Donald Cousens Parkway to York Durham Line stretch (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). There was only one private landowner with a rental property that abutted this section of 16TH Avenue (iTrans Consulting Inc., 2009). The traditional public engagement undertaken of two PICs was not likely to elicit much interest. This severely limited achievement of criteria QL 1.1: Improve quality of life and LD 1.4: Provide for Stakeholder Involvement. Outreach to additional stakeholders, such as road users, was not undertaken. This section of 16th Avenue has very limited existing or potential cycling or pedestrian movement. There is no public transit along this section either. This directly limits achievement of criteria QL 2.4: Improve Community Mobility and Access, and QL 2.5: Encourage Alternative Forms of Transportation. The existing 16th Avenue was conveyed over the Little Rouge River via a bailey bridge with historic significance. The old Baily Bridge was retained due to its historic significance and potential integration into a future trail network for Rouge Park (now the Rouge National Park). However, this means that the project added an additional crossing of the valley, rather than

71   

      replacing or expanding an existing crossing which is most often the case. The large new bridge had negative impacts on riparian vegetation- due to shadow impacts preventing vegetation growth, rip rap was proposed under the bridge. It is difficult to compensate for the impact from a new bridge crossing, limiting achievement under criterion NW 3.4: Maintain Wetland and Surface Water Functions. Only two criteria were deemed not applicable as defined by Envision: NW 1.4 Avoid Adverse Geology and RA 3.3: Monitor Water Systems for a total potential of 15 points reduced from the total applicable score. The project scored between 6.2% and 9.5%, far below the minimum award threshold of 20%. This would be a challenging project for achievement of an Envision award based on standard practices. An award would require achievement in the Leadership, Resources Allocation, and the Climate and Risk categories, to compensate for the limitations in achievement for many criteria in the Quality of Life and Natural World criterion. This project raises two issues relative to the effectiveness in Envision rewarding relatively more sustainable projects: trade-offs between social and natural environments, and limitations on achievement of some criterion achievement due to the project's circumstances. Similar to Kirkhams Road, 16th Avenue is another example of sustainability trade-offs; a bridge with historic significance was retained, but the bridge would impede flood flows and is an impediment to the movement of some wildlife, so from an ecological perspective, it would have been preferable to remove the bridge. The project gained 7 points in criterion QL 3.1 for preserving the Old Bailey Bridge and could have achieved another 3-8 points under criterion QL 3.3 if the proponent had provided access to the Old Baily Bridge and restored it. The project sacrificed up to 9 points in criterion NW 1.5 for impacts and lost restoration opportunities to the natural system by keeping the Old Bailey Bridge. In this case the Envision framework would score the two competing options as roughly equal.

72   

     

8.2.6    Torbram Road Grade Separation 
The Environmental Assessment was prepared on behalf of the City of Mississauga and the City of Brampton, although the City of Mississauga was the lead agency. The EA purpose was to identify and assess alternatives for the construction of a grade separation of Torbram Road and the CN tracks (Acres International, 2005). Several previous studies were undertaken ­ a 1983 Functional Plan for the grade separation, a 1990 Preliminary Design Report, and a 1993 update to the Preliminary Design Report (Acres International, 2005). Torbram Road in the study area is a major arterial road south of the crossings and a minor arterial road north of the crossings. It is an industrial area with two separate at-grade crossings of CN tracks. The existing vehicular traffic and trail traffic volumes warranted consideration of a grade separation at both crossings (Acres International, 2005). The alternative designs considered for each of the two at-grade crossings were an overpass, an underpass, and a combination overpass and underpass (Acres International, 2005). The preferred design was a road underpass for each of the two rail crossings (Acres International, 2005). The road alignment was maintained, with 2 lanes in each direction and sidewalks provided (Acres International, 2005). A gravity drain storm sewer system handled storms up to the 25 year maximum, with pumps handling larger storms (Acres International, 2005). The existing culvert conveying the west tributary was replaced with a larger three cell box culvert and 35m of the tributary were realigned to improve storm flow conveyance (Acres International, 2005). Criteria QL 1.1 and LD 1.4 achieved few points as there was little evidence to indicate that the community stakeholders were meaningfully engaged ­ only the standard two PICs were held with no evidence supporting that any comments were incorporated into the design. The scope of the project being limited to just the underpasses, rather than a longer extent of road,

73   

      combined with limited public transportation, cycling and pedestrian traffic, meant that many criteria that could encourage public transportation and active transportation were beyond the scope of this project. The existing watercourse is of poor quality and the crossing culvert undersized, allowing for easy achievement of several criteria related to improved flood conveyance and other ecosystem functions. As noted elsewhere, Envision does not provide higher scores for greater quality improvement to the local natural system; criteria provide high scores as long as various functions are improved over existing conditions. This does mean that Envision has a bias towards improvements to natural system functions that are relatively cheap and easy because the existing system is so highly degraded. It is interesting to note that TRCA was strongly concerned with an increase in flood risk to human life because the underpasses will flood in the `Regional Storm' and there is the potential for individuals to become stranded on the road between the two underpasses with no safe escape route. Flood risk is not considered explicitly in any Envision criterion ­ the project only needs to decrease overall flood depths. This is an example of how difficult it is to word the criteria in such a way as to capture the subtle differences between projects that could have a huge impact on the sustainability of the project. While increasing flood risk could limit achievement in the resilience criteria CR 2.1 to CR 2.4, this is an example of a project not being penalized for a design that detracts from sustainability.

8.2.7    Leslie Street and Main Street Markham Envision Score Comparison 
Leslie Street from Bloomington Road to Stouffville Road, and Main Street Markham received the highest Base, Upper and `Low Fruit' Scores. Main Street Markham was the closest to achieving an award with an Upper Score of 19.55%, which rounds up to the 20% required for the lowest award of Bronze.

74   

      Both projects had exceptional public consultation, well beyond the industry norms. The more thorough public consultation was undertaken to manage the strong public interest in both projects. Both projects achieved the maximum scores in criterion QL 1.1 Improve Community Quality Of Life from the base to low fruit scores as a reflection of the exceptional public consultation. All other projects were given a base score of 0 and an upper and low fruit score of 0 to 10 for criterion QL 1.1, as they implemented the two standard Public Information Centres. In a related criterion, LD 1.4 Provide for Stakeholder Involvement, both projects achieved the second highest score of 9. All other projects achieved between 1 and 5 for the base and upper score for criterion LD 1.4. Beyond stakeholder consultation, both projects diverged in achieving further scores. The Main Street Markham project had clear economic benefits to local businesses, improved the walkability of Main Street and encouraged both active transportation and public transit use. This led to total scores of 62 and 93 for the base and upper scores respectively under the quality of life criteria, far exceeding the sum of the mean scores of all projects in the quality of life criteria of 12 and 19 respectively. 90 of the 155 points achieved for the Main Street Markham project in the upper score came from the 12 of 55 criteria in the Quality of Life category. Under the Leadership and Resource Allocation categories, Main Street Markham achieved only slightly higher than the average of the other projects. However, Main Street Markham achieved an upper score sum of only 26 in the Natural World criteria, as compared to a mean total score of 47.8 from all projects. Leslie Street, by comparison, is a rural road that will remain a two lane rural road. There are no opportunities to provide any businesses with productivity improvements. Furthermore there is little cycling and pedestrian traffic existing and little potential for it, and there are no existing bus routes along the study area. As such, Leslie Street was limited to an achievement

75   

      of only 26 as an upper score under the Quality of Life criteria, 25 of which came from the first criterion 1.1. Leslie Street achieved an upper score of 71 for the criteria under Natural World, as compared to the mean of all projects of 47.8, for the extensive improvements to wetland and riparian habitat.

8.2.8    Summary 
As compared to the other projects assessed, Bloomington Road was clearly among the least sustainable projects assessed. However, it is not clear that Bloomington Road was the least sustainable project. While Bloomington Road was given a base score of 3.5%, seven projects received base scores between 6.8% and 8.3%. For example, the Torbram Road Grade separation received a base score of 8.0%. Both projects had little opportunity to improve public transit or cycling with little demand for either. While the Torbram Road grade separation did not widen the road, the natural system was so degraded it would have made little difference, and the grade separation would still have the effect of increasing the capacity of the road by removing the at-grade crossing. However, it is difficult to compare the sustainability impact of the wetland loss in Bloomington Road to the increase in risk to life and property by putting two road underpasses in the Regional Storm Floodplain in the Torbram Road Grade Separation. While Bloomington Road received the lowest base score, it is not certain that it is the least sustainable project assessed because it is difficult to compare objectively the various sustainability trade-offs between the projects. In the analysis, Envision more clearly provided the highest scores to the two most sustainable projects ­ Leslie Street and Main Street Markham. While both the Leslie Street and Main Street Markham projects achieved high scores in some criteria for their extensive consultation, they each had different areas of strength that pushed up their total scores. Both Leslie Street and Main Street Markham are clearly more sustainable than any of the other

76   

      projects reviewed. Leslie Street and Main Street Markham both lack the sustainability tradeoffs and impacts that are apparent in the other projects reviewed. In summary, while it is not clear from the 13 projects assessed that the Envision protocol gave the lowest score to the least sustainable project, it most certainly gave the higher scores to the two most sustainable projects. One of the challenges with the data set in testing the ability of Envision to pick out the least sustainable projects is that there was an insufficient spread in scores. No project would have received an Envision award based on the conservative base scores and only one would have received an award based on the less conservative Upper scores.

8.3    The Findings of Saville, Miller, and Brumbelow 
8.3.1    The Sustainable Nature of the Project Itself is not Directly Addressed 
For 11 of the 13 projects assessed in this study, additional general use vehicular travel lanes were added across all or part of the study area. While criterion QL 1.1 encourages the proponent to ensure the project meets local needs, criteria QL 2.4 and QL 2.5 provide higher scores for projects that encourage alternative modes of transportation, and various criteria under the Resource Allocation and Natural World are more difficult to score higher on with the large footprint and materials needed for a wider road, no single criterion clearly and directly addresses the `elephant in the room' of the sustainability of widening a road, especially to add general purpose lanes. Based on this study, a road widening could achieve the higher award of Platinum while adding general purpose lanes. The I-4 Highway in Florida achieved the highest rating of Platinum. Nevertheless, given that North American society is in the paradigm of individual car ownership requiring ever more and wider roads, a more sustainable road in all other aspects is still a benefit to society.

77   

     

8.3.2    There is no Weighting of Criteria Based Upon Local Needs
The second conclusion of Saville, Miller and Brumbelow (2016) is that, like other ISRSs, Envision does not allow for adjustments to the weightings to reflect local sustainability needs. While it would be ideal for Envision to provide a mechanism for the criterion scores to be adjusted, there are trade-offs. While some accuracy is lost by not allowing for adjustments to reflect local sustainability priorities, the benefit is a more objective framework that is easier to implement. With 809 points spread across 55 criteria, each with 1 to 5 levels of achievement, adjusting the framework to reflect local sustainability priorities in an objective, transparent manner while minimizing the incentives to adjust the weighting in a way that maximizes the score of a project, would be very complicated. Envision is already a very detailed, demanding framework so further complicate it may impact the ability to gain buy-in from municipalities. Furthermore, while some criteria may be over-weighted relative to local sustainability priorities, others will be under-weighted, so the weighting should balance out. So while Saville, Miller, and Brumbelow (2016) are correct in the finding, their critique is overstated based on this study.

8.3.3    The Project Focus Omits a Systems Scale 
Similar to their second conclusion, Saville, Miller, and Brumbelow (2016) also concluded that Envision has a project oriented focus and generally neglects a systems-level perspective. An example in the projects assessed is Kirkhams Road, which received a higher score for discouraging the use of the car (in this case a bridge was removed). However, while traffic on Kirkhams Road decreased marginally as a result of removing the bridge, those trips simply rerouted to adjacent roads. This is an issue that could be partially addressed in the next iteration of the Envision guideline through consideration of larger system effects associated with every criterion.

78   

      Similarly, a multi-use pathway and well-designed bus stops along arterial roads are only part of the solution in shifting the modal split. Smart land use planning and other programs are needed to encourage walking, cycling and public transportation use. There is a trade-off between a project and systems level focus. Systems level thinking can be immensely complex and a revising Envision through systems level thinking will increase its complexity. The complexity of Envision is already such that it will be difficult to encourage its adoption. Revising Envision to reflect more systems level thinking risks may make it more difficult to get municipalities to support Envision.

8.3.4    There is an Uneven Weighting of the Three Sustainability Pillars 
The Envision criteria are multi-disciplinary. Saville, Miller, and Brumbelow (2016) found that environmental sustainability is the focus of 57% of Envision points, contending that while the economic pillar is often the focus of EAs, the social environment should be weighted more heavily in the Envision criteria. While the natural environment is definitely the focus of many criteria, the criteria generally are designed to be interconnected and support various aspects of social, economic and environmental sustainability. The fourth conclusion of Saville, Miller, and Brumbelow is not supported by an explanation of why the weighting of the three pillars should be even. The more appropriate critique is that Envision the chosen weighting of criterion and pillars should be supported by peer reviewed research with published papers.

8.3.5    The Positive Scoring Often Overlooks Negative Aspects of the Project 
While criteria are designed to reward sustainable processes and designs, they do not subtract from the score for processes and designs that detract from the project's sustainability. For example, while many criteria address various aspects of, and implications for, the sustainability of adding general purpose travel lanes to an existing road, no single criterion clearly and directly addresses whether it is sustainable to add more general purpose travel 79   

      lanes to an existing road. Another example is the financial implications of the project. While Envision rewards projects with local economic benefits in various criteria under Quality of Life, there is no consideration of the cost of the project. Kirkhams Road is an example where Envision would likely have provided a higher score to an alternative not ultimately chosen, in part due to the associated financial cost. However, Envision does not purport to adhere to a strict definition of sustainability and does not state that achievement of a specific award level means a project is sustainable. Envision is designed to improve sustainability outcomes over existing standards; Envision rewards relative improvements, not absolute achievements. Integrating penalties for less sustainable projects would be complicated to design and weight and the Envision guideline is already very complex to use. Penalties would also risk discouraging projects that will go ahead regardless and that can be planned and designed to be relatively more sustainable.

8.4    Envision Endorsement 
While there is little doubt that planning a project with the goal of certifying it through Envision will improve the sustainability of the construction, maintenance and decommissioning of the project, there are concerns. While a project that is planned through Envision is more sustainable than it would otherwise be, a project can achieve an award without being strictly sustainable. The Envision documentation defines the Conservative achievement level as having no net impacts and the Restorative level as a net improvement, implying that a project that achieves a Conserving or Restorative rating in criterion has achieved strict sustainability in that criterion; however, there is no claim in the Envision document that a project that achieves a specific award level should be considered sustainable. For example, the I-4 Highway in Florida achieved the highest award of Platinum. Although the I-4 project received the highest overall award, the main result of the project was to expand and support the existing growth paradigm of 80   

      individual car ownership through increasing the capacity of a road. Clearly the I-4 Highway project is not a strictly sustainable project. Irrespective of being less unsustainable than a standard road, the increase in capacity of vehicular traffic serves to further entrench an unsustainable paradigm of car travel and sprawling land development patterns. However, the purpose of the Envision framework is to improve project sustainability by challenging and advancing current standards of practice; aside from the challenges of identifying strictly sustainable projects, if Envision only provided awards to only strictly sustainable projects, it would risk limiting the range of projects to which the protocol could be applied. The greater the range of projects that apply Envision the less unsustainable roads will become. In response to research question four, Envision should be endorsed by CAs to supplement their commend roles under the OEAA, and MCEA, and their regulatory roles under the CA Act. CAs are limited by the `command and control' nature of the OEAA and MCEA and the limitations of regulations in advancing the sustainability of road projects in southern Ontario. Envision is a voluntary alternative motivation framework for undertaking comprehensive assessments of the sustainability of infrastructure projects. As shown in this study, the existing standard of practice for road reconstruction and widening projects is below the lowest Envision award level of Bronze. Whether Envision is endorsed as policy or for verifying projects, the Envision framework has great potential for improving project sustainability.

8.5    Preliminary Discussion of Options and Next Steps for CAs 
Although Envision was developed as a framework to follow, ISI and Zofnass have made the guideline freely available, with low-cost and free training. ISI and Zofnass are primarily concerned with improving the sustainability of infrastructure and fully support the framework being used in various ways. Options CAs could consider for using the Envision framework are: endorsing Envision to be used by municipalities on their larger budget projects for verification 81   

      and encouraging and working with municipalities to develop their own protocol for following the Envision guideline and publishing self-ratings for all other projects; encouraging CA staff and municipal staff to undertake the Envision training, but not necessarily encourage municipalities to adopt Envision as policy; and working with municipalities to develop a best practices guideline for sustainable road planning and design, using Envision as one source of best practices. Given the high cost of both added documentation and the fee for verification, municipalities are unlikely to pursue verification for most projects. The ideal approach may be for a municipality to have a few projects at various scales verified. This would aid in training its Project Managers and Env SPs on how to interpret the criteria for various scales of projects. Many questions have been raised previously about how to interpret various aspects of the Envision guideline. The knowledge gained from verification can be applied to setting expectations and a process for the assessment of non-verified projects. The large number of municipal road projects means that the vast majority could not be officially certified by ISI. This study shows that many criteria were not prepared with a clear objective of use in the reconstruction of existing roads, as is the most common road project under the MCEA process. Many terms are highly, such as "meaningful consultation", are subjective and their interpretation can have a large impact on the project's overall score. It is not clear that a project team and municipality, without a peer review through ISI, would be able to provide a true, objective rating of their project, thus undermining both the credibility of the Envision system and its purpose. As a case in point, the two roads projects self-rated and listed on the Los Angeles County website would likely fall under the MCEA if done in Ontario. One project was self-rated just above the threshold of Bronze and the other just above the threshold of Silver. There could be a perception that both projects were adjusted just enough to push the overall ratings up to achieve the next rating. 82   

      It may be possible for CAs to fill the role of unofficial peer reviewer of Municipal projects under Envision. However, it would be an immense undertaking that would require additional staff and resources. Furthermore, it may put CAs in the awkward position of being under pressure by their municipal partners to inflate the ratings of their projects. Furthermore, CA staff may not necessarily have much expertise in many of the areas of Envision, undermining their ability and credibility in providing an effective peer review of those criteria. It would be best if municipalities were to develop their own internal process of checks and balances to ensure the Envision protocol was implemented correctly without ISI oversight. With their expertise in some of the areas of sustainability, CAs could provide valuable support to their municipal partners in implementing Envision as a policy requirement. There will be significant resistance to getting municipalities to endorse Envision as policy or to undertake a case study of a project because municipalities would be concerned with added costs and delays to their planning and approvals processes. The first step would be for a CA to identify key individuals in their respective municipalities known for taking risks and pushing standards of practice. The CA could work with these key individuals to identify a few criteria of Envision and implement a case study. An example would be to find a Project Manager willing to undertake a Lifecycle Carbon Assessment, as per criterion CR 1.1. Many of these perceived barriers will become less daunting once there are new standards that can be followed to undertake these new procedures. If a municipality goes no further, this is still a key win for Envision. The next step would be to encourage a municipality to undertake verification of a key project that already has the support to be advanced to a high standard of sustainability. This will get some support and recognition of Envision at a municipality. With a key project verified and some of the more daunting criteria already tested individually on projects, there may be sufficient momentum for a CA to encourage a municipality to endorse Envision as policy. 83   

      Alternatively, CAs could encourage their staff and municipal staff to undertake the Envision training as a learning tool. Envision could be very useful as a framework for driving the conversation and a deeper understanding in the project team about all aspects of sustainable road planning and design. As is apparent in the results, there are many aspects of sustainability related to roads that are given little thought at the moment. The last option is for CAs, ideally in partnership with municipalities, to develop best practices guidelines for planning and designing sustainable infrastructure. The Envision framework could be used as a key source of best practices for such a guideline. The main benefit is that it can be customized to the sustainability needs of the CA; the risk is that its effectiveness is tied to the endorsements by municipalities. It may also be difficult for CAs to draw best practices from the Envision Quality of Life and Leadership categories as they are outside the CAs' main mandate as resource management agencies. Encouraging CA and municipal staff to undertake the Envision training, and developing a best practices guideline for planning and designing sustainable infrastructure can both be used as first steps towards increasing the awareness and appreciation of CA and municipal staff towards Envision. With greater awareness and appreciation, it is more likely that projects will start following the Envision framework. Lastly, as a result of this study I have a number of editorial suggestions to for ISI in their next iteration of the Envision document. These edits should also make the document clearer for all users and especially those applying it to routine road widening and reconstruction projects.

9    Conclusions 
This study applied the Envision framework to a sample set of 13 road projects from across the jurisdiction of TRCA to understand how Envision recognizes and quantifies the sustainability of projects. The Envision framework challenges projects to be planned and designed more sustainably than they otherwise would, but does not identify whether a project is sustainable. Through an analysis and discussion of the results of the application of Envision to the sample, this study identified the gaps between the current standard of practice and that of the Envision framework for road projects. The level of sustainability of the 11 of the 13 projects assessed is far lower than the lowest Envision award level of Bronze. To the extent that this result can be extrapolated to road planning and design in general in Ontario, the level of sustainability has much room for improvement. This study has shown that a project that pursues an Envision award should achievement higher sustainability in most of the 55 criteria as compared with the standards of practice. This study has also shown that for some criteria, the level of achievement was quite high due to various regulations, such as related to flood risk under the CA Act and regulations. This study contrasted the categories and projects of the sample, including the projects that scored highest and lowest. This study has provided preliminary evidence that Envision can differentiate between more and less sustainable projects. A larger sample set with a greater spread in achievement would be needed to more strongly support this conclusion. This study undertook a critique of the use of Envision in the advancement of sustainable road design and planning in Ontario to answer the key overall research question of whether CAs should endorse Envision to supplement their regulation. This study examined the five critiques

85   

      of Envision by Saville, Miller and Brumbelow (2016). This study found the critiques to be overstated. Finally, this study identified and discussed the implications of these findings for municipalities and CAs to determine whether CAs should endorse Envision to supplement their commenting roles under the OEAA, MCEA, and their regulations under the CA Act. Based on the results of the objectives above, Envision should be endorsed by CAs who should work with municipalities to implement it. However, it was beyond the scope of this study to definitively suggest the mechanism for CAs to endorse, how they should work with municipalities and ultimately how municipalities should implement Envision. Assuming there was a mechanism for doing so, it would be inappropriate for a CA to tie regulatory approvals to an Envision Assessment because most of the Envision criteria are not related to the CA Act. Furthermore, requiring an Envision rating risks undermining the creative problem solving resulting from a project team voluntarily pursuing higher sustainability achievement. However, CAs could take the approach of encouraging municipalities to follow Envision because doing so would facilitate obtaining CA sign-off on their EAs and facilitating obtaining permits under the appropriate regulation under the CA Act.

10    Research Limitations 
In order to assess a large number of projects, the accuracy of the ratings was reduced, requiring a base and upper score to capture ranges of confidence. Some criteria had no supporting information and required assumptions to provide a score. Many criteria had only partial information in the documentation, requiring inferences or assumptions to provide a score. It was beyond the scope of this research to obtain the additional project documentation or undertake the interviews that would have filled in some of the assessment gaps. My knowledge of current industry practice is not as strong for all criteria, so some inferences and assumptions are stronger than others. Also, the interpretation of some criteria was unclear, impacting the accuracy of the project scores. The thirteen road projects chosen were not a randomized, statistically significant sample and were all from within the jurisdiction of TRCA. As each CA has slightly different programs and policies, and faces slightly different development pressures within their watershed, extrapolation of the findings of this research to the jurisdiction of other CAs needs to be done with caution. As stated earlier the development of Envision was not subject to formal peer reviewed papers, which may detract from its acceptance in academia. It also opens up the framework to various criticisms, such as in regards to how the weighting of the criterion was chosen.

11    Future Areas of Research 
The focus of this study was on the appropriate use of Envision in Southern Ontario based on a variety of road reconstruction projects. The scope of the study did not allow for the detailed analysis of projects required to provide a single definitive score for each project. A future study could analyse additional project documentation such as the project specifications and contract documents, and undertake interviews with individuals from the EA, detailed design and construction teams to develop a single score with a higher level of confidence. Interviews with staff from ISI would also be required to obtain clarification on some credit interpretation. This higher level of analysis would provide additional insights into the mechanics of applying Envision to more routine road widening projects. Additional research could be undertaken into understanding the perceptions, opportunities and challenges with bringing Envision into municipal policy. This research would require interviews with, or surveys of, various PMs and other municipal staff to gauge their current awareness of ISRS, including Envision, and to understand the biggest challenges to using Envision.

No documentation of sustainable procurement, and  reasonable assumption this is not done in practice outside of  LEED projects; as it has been done for LEED projects, it's a  reasonable assumption that the lowest level of improved  could have been achieved through <15% materials from  2 suppliers with 'sustainability practice' No documentation of EA or detailed design project teams  analyzing reuse of on site materials, but this was likely done  by contractor to reduce expenses. No evidence of specifying  materials with recycled content, but its likely the contractor  still purchased materials with recycled content to reduce  expenses. Its standard for pavement and granular subgrade to  contain a significant percentage of recycled material, so its  safe to assume 20% (by weight or volume) of materials on site  are recyled. As credit may not be given, the base score is zero.  An upper score of Superior is given based upon credit given  for the contractor purchasing but not specifying materials  with recycled content. A low fruit rating of Enhanced is given  as it should be easily acheived for the municipality to specify  11 materials with recycled contact. No documentation for the specification  of local materials, but  with the cost of transportation its likely a large percentage of  materials were sourced within the specified distances. Its  unclear if achievement of the credit requires explicit  specification of local materials by the contractor. If credit is  acheived, its conservatively assumed to be an upper  acheivement of Improved (30% local) and a low hanging fruit  of Enhanced (60% local). Achievement could have been and  could be much higher but I don't have evidence to accurately  6 assess so I've used a conservative assessment.

As the  project adds general purpose lanes to an existing road, this is  0 unachievable so no credit is given or possible. No achievement since the vast majority of energy used in the  operation and maintenance of the road will be fossil fuels. A  very significant shift to electric vehicles would be required  because Ontario's dominant Nuclear power is not a renewable  0 resource as per Envision. There is no documentation in the files review for the EA or  detailed design related to how the lighting systems would be  commissioned, but such information isn't expected to sent to  TRCA anyways. I don't have sufficient knowledge of standard  practices in how municipalities commission and monitor  lighting standards to properly assess this credit. The likely  range of scores is too low to justify the effort required to  more confidently score this credit. So a conservative range of  none to Enhanced is given. The next achievement jumps to  conserving and requires extensive commissioning and  monitoring of systems and as Conservative for any credit is  intended to be far beyond current standards of practice, I've  3 assumed its not low hanging fruit. No level of achievement. The project only assessed  groundwater conditions for the purposes of assessing  dewatering needs during construction which does not meet  many of the requirements of a water availability assessment  (criterion A). The project anticipated dewatering rates of  30,000L per day during construction. The project will not  require water takings during operation (criterion B).  Therefore no achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is given  since an analysis of groundwater and surface water from the  0 perspective of availability is not relevant to this project. No level of achievement given as there is no evidence of a  potable water reduction strategy and it can be assumed one  wasn't done regardless as roads use little potable water  generally during operation and maintenance. For roads, the  only opportunity is the use of drought resistant plants in  planted medians or boulevards to which stormwater is  directed to eliminate the need to water plants with potable  water; as such a redesign could be significant and I've  assumed significant redesigns are no low hanging fruit, no low  0 hanging fruit score given. Not applicable since project does not involve potable water  systems in its operation that could be monitored. This  criterion would apply if there was an associated watermain.

Not applicable as there are no valley slopes of concern within  project area Although more than 50% of the project is located on an  already developed area, it only makes sense to count the  existing road as a grey area if serious planning consideration  was given to new road alignments entirely within greenfields.  This is not the case here, so no acheivement is given or  0 possible. For the purposes of water quantity calculations the existing  road needs to be considered a greyfield. Credit requires that  water storage capacity be maintained in the greenfield and  must be improved in the greyfield (existing road) by at least  30% for an Enhanced rating.

As an overall  improvement water storage and infiltration over pre development conditions is not achieved no credit is given.

No achievement given or possible without the  creation of a significant number of new jobs  0 during design, construction and operation. My opinion is that a municipality would never  and probably couldn not legally restrict a  contractor to hiring local workers; the most that  could probably be done is including a policy to  look favourably in the tendering process of  contractors with a policy of training and hiring  0 needy or disadvantaged workers No new sustainability technologies have been  proposed, so there's no opportunity to assess  associated Health and Safety implications;  therefore no achievement is given. As other low  fruit score may require the use of new  sustainability technologies, there would be an  associated opportunity to assess the associated  Health and Safey implications so a conservative  2 low fruit score of Improved is given.  Undertook noise analysis but no mitigation  proposed since increase below MOE threshold.  However, did not study construction noise, so no  achievement. Low hanging fruit of improved by  1 expanding baseline study to construction noise. No evidence of any analysis of lighting needs. No  low hanging fruit as that would require efforts to  reduce lighting energy requirements which is not  relevant for a project that does not propose  lighting.

Limited consideration of transit and cycling in the  EA/planning phase should be sufficient for  Improved level.

Only basic credit of Improved achieved and  possible with sidewalks, bus stops and paved  shoulders provided.

The investigation found no cultural or historic  resources in the study are so no credit can be  0 given nor is possible to achieve. No credit since no public view plan undertaken.  Given the low pedestrian and cycling volumes  and the lack of valleys, a view plan will be a tough  0 sell to justify. No achievement and little opportunity within the  0 project scope to create public space. 18 York Region has their 2007 Sustainability Strategy  which informed their Vision 2051. No annual  reporting of sustainability progress so  achievement limited to Enhanced, with no low  4 hanging fruit Although it can't be confirmed that no specific  person was given the responsibility of  sustainability, it is unlikely as sustainability is not  addressed in the ESR, and its irrelevant because a  project must meet criterion A through E for all  levels of achievement. Meeting criterion A  through E would require an extensive  commitment to sustainability within the project  team through various business sustainability  processes, and given that sustainability as a  concept is not considered in EAs for road projects  in the GTA in my experience, such commitment is  not considered low hanging fruit. No ESRs in any  ESRs reviewed for this thesis even used the term  sustainability except in reference to the title of  0 another document. The EA documentation does not directly address  sustainability, but the detailed design natural  impact assessment report was very thorough.  The project integrates with water and  wastewater systems upgrades, transit, cycling  and pedestrian access, so credit of Enhanced for  a systems view is given. No low fruit because the  next level requires a much more involved  4 stakeholder involvement. Fairly well attended PICs held. Stakeholder input  summarized in EA with responses and design  altered in response to some concerns. Credit of  improved to enhanced given; superior would  have required more frequent communication  5 with stakeholders throughout project. No assessment of unwanted byproducts of  nearby facilities. Therefore no achievement. Not  likely relevant to road constuction so no low  0 hanging fruit No evidence that project team sought to improve  project sustainability through project wide  0 systems integration; 2 year monitoring of infrastructure is standard  and likely to have occurred, but only monitoring  of the bridges beyond 2 years is standard, so no  credit given. Adding monitoring of the wetland  for an additional 35 years should be achievable  3 and would earn Enhanced.

Likely achieved Improved by considering to some  degree the flexibility, durability and resilience of  road and culverts. Achieving Enhanced requires  documentation of consideration of future  expansion or reconfiguration which is given a low  3 hanging fruit score. 20 No documentation of an LCA and reasonable  assumption one was never done as I have never  heard of one occuring in my career for a  municipal EA; a LCA is very resource intensive so  0 its not considered low hanging fruit. No documentation of sustainable procurement,  and reasonable assumption this is not done in  practice outside of LEED projects; as it has been  done for LEED projects, it's a reasonable  assumption that the lowest level of improved  could have been achieved through <15%  materials from suppliers with 'sustainability  2 practice' No documentation of EA or detailed design  project teams analyzing reuse of on site  materials, but this was likely done by contractor  to reduce expenses. No evidence of specifying  materials with recycled content, but its likely the  contractor still purchased materials with recycled  content to reduce expenses. Its standard for  pavement and granular subgrade to contain a  significant percentage of recycled material, so its  safe to assume 20% (by weight or volume) of  materials on site are recyled. As credit may not  be given, the base score is zero. An upper score  of Superior is given based upon credit given for  the contractor purchasing but not specifying  materials with recycled content. A low fruit rating  of Enhanced is given as it should be easily  acheived for the municipality to specify materials  11 with recycled contact. No documentation for the  specification  of local  materials, but with the cost of transportation its  likely a large percentage of materials were  sourced within the specified distances. Its unclear  if achievement of the credit requires explicit  specification of local materials by the contractor.  If credit is acheived, its conservatively assumed  to be an upper acheivement of Improved (30%  local) and a low hanging fruit of Enhanced (60%  local). Achievement could have been and could  be much higher but I don't have evidence to  accurately assess so I've used a conservative  6 assessment. No base or upper achievement since no  comprehensive waste management plan likely  implemented. With recyclability of asphalt,  granular and concrete, its low hanging fruit to  achieve 50% recycle/reuse of onsite materials  which gives a level of enhanced. Actual low fruit  achievement could be even higher, but a more  detailed analysis would be required to support  6 this. The level of achievement is based upon a  percentage of excavated materials  suitable for  reuse  that are reused on site.

As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly  recyclable so evalation criterion A is met which  on its on leads to a maximum achivement of  Improved. Higher levels of achievement require  specific efforts to facilitate future recycling which  is highly unlikely to have occurred, but with little  extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature of  many road materials would yield a rating of  8 Superior for the low hanging fruit Even if options to reduce energy consumption  were considered, a basic Improved level requires  a decrease of 10% of energy consumption during  operation over industry norms, and must include  energy consumed by vehicular traffic. As the  project adds general purpose lanes to an existing  road, this is unachievable so no credit is given or  0 possible. No achievement since the vast majority of energy  used in the operation and maintenance of the  road will be fossil fuels. A very significant shift to  electric vehicles would be required because  Ontario's dominant Nuclear power is not a  0 renewable resource as per Envision. Exclude credit as this project does not propose  any electrical systems. No level of achievement. The project only  assessed groundwater conditions for the  purposes of assessing dewatering needs during  construction which does not meet many of the  requirements of a water availability assessment  (criterion A). The project will not require water  takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore  no achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is  given since an analysis of groundwater and  surface water from the perspective of availability  0 is not relevant to this project. No level of achievement given as there is no  evidence of a potable water reduction strategy  and it can be assumed one wasn't done  regardless as roads use little potable water  generally during operation and maintenance. For  roads, the only opportunity is the use of drought  resistant plants in planted medians or boulevards  to which stormwater is directed to eliminate the  need to water plants with potable water; as such  a redesign could be significant and I've assumed  significant redesigns are no low hanging fruit, no  0 low hanging fruit score given. Not applicable since project does not involve  potable water systems in its operation that could  be monitored. This criterion would apply if there  was an associated watermain. 39 Project expanded the existing road within a PSW,  negating any acheivement or potential  0 achievement. No achievement since road bisects PSW expands  into PSW. Can't establish buffer as road bisects  0 wetland, so no achievement possible.

Unclear  no documentation of specification  of local materials, but with expense of  transporting materials its likely contractor  purchased local materials to save money. Its  unclear if this meets the credit intent. Unlikely  There is no documentation in the  EA or detailed design regarding a  comprehensive waste management plan.  Although the contractor likely diverted  waste to save landfill charges and make  money selling the materials its highly  unlikely this was done through a  comprehensive waste management stategy Yes  ESR describes reuse of fill on site for  the embankments. Although I had no  documentation in materials I had available  at detailed design, it is standard to estimate  cut and fill in detailed design or by the  contractor to reduce costs of transportating  and disposing of soils offsite.

No documentation for the specification  of local materials, but with the  cost of transportation its likely a large percentage of materials were  sourced within the specified distances. Its unclear if achievement of the  credit requires explicit specification of local materials by the contractor. If  credit is acheived, its conservatively assumed to be an upper acheivement  of Improved (30% local) and a low hanging fruit of Enhanced (60% local).  Achievement could have been and could be much higher but I don't have  6 evidence to accurately assess so I've used a conservative assessment.

No base or upper achievement since no comprehensive waste  management plan likely implemented. With recyclability of asphalt,  granular and concrete, its low hanging fruit to achieve 50% recycle/reuse  of onsite materials which gives a level of enhanced. Actual low fruit  achievement could be even higher, but a more detailed analysis would be  6 required to support this.

No achievement since the vast majority of energy used in the operation  and maintenance of the road will be fossil fuels.

There is no documentation in the files review for the EA or detailed design  related to how the lighting systems would be commissioned, but such  information isn't expected to sent to TRCA anyways. I don't have sufficient  knowledge of standard practices in how municipalities commission and  monitor lighting standards to properly assess this credit. The likely range of  scores is too low to justify the effort required to more confidently score  this credit. So a conservative range of none to Enhanced is given. The next  achievement jumps to conserving and requires extensive commissioning  and monitoring of systems and as Conservative for any credit is intended  to be far beyond current standards of practice, I've assumed its not low  3 hanging fruit.

addressed capacity, multi use pathway, bus stop for  rapid transit, sight lines at Manswood; no  achievement given because there's no evidence to  support that the local community was meaningfully  engaged (criterion D). Achievemement of D requires  communities be "meaningfully engaged" in the  project. Superier requires D and that all negative  impacts on the nearby community be reduced or  eliminated.

No achievement given or possible without the  creation of a significant number of new jobs during  0 design, construction and operation. My opinion is that a municipality would never and  probably couldn not legally restrict a contractor to  hiring local workers; the most that could probably be  done is including a policy to look favourably in the  tendering process of contractors with a policy of  0 training and hiring needy or disadvantaged workers No new sustainability technologies have been  proposed, so there's no opportunity to assess  associated Health and Safety implications; therefore  no achievement is given. As other low fruit score may  require the use of new sustainability technologies,  there would be an associated opportunity to assess  the associated Health and Safey implications so a  2 conservative low fruit score of Improved is given.  Undertook noise analysis but no mitigation proposed  since increase below MOE threshold. However, did not  study construction noise, so no achievement. Low  hanging fruit of improved by expanding baseline study  1 to construction noise. No base achievement as there's no evidence specific  efforts were made to reduce lighting energy  requirements; an upper score of improved reflects the  uncertainty in assessing credit B. A low fruit score of  Enhanced reflects a simple assessment of lighting  needs, during and postconstruction, installation of  energy efficient light standards, and basic efforts to  2 reduce light spillage. Level of improved given due to evidence of only  limited coordination with owners and operators of  adjacent facilities. Enhanced level would need project  specific, purposeful coordination with owners of  4 adjacent facilities so is given as low hanging fruit. Achievement of Enhanced based upon buses along  Queen Street providing access to multi modal transit  facilities, the restriction of parking, and support for  cycling connected to a cycling network. An  achievement of Superior requires secure bicycle  lockers at the transit stops, which would be a tough  3 sell for their expense relative to the bus stop use.

For this project clearly achieving the level of  conserving constitutes low hanging fruit that could  have been achieved with an analysis of viewscapes  and clear, documented consultation with local  residents on viewscapes and local character that  would also support the low hanging fruit achievement  of QL2.6. In this case a public view plan is explicitly  required to even achieve the lowest level of improved,  6 so no achievement for base or upper is given. Credit applies as project adjacent to Clairville  Conservation Area. Improved achieved due to  accomodation of fence post resource and no long term adverse effects. Enhanced not achieved since  emphasis on mitigation of impacts, not avoidance, and  no consideration of new public spaces. No low haning  fruit given since achievement of Enhanced requires  avoidance of impacts to resources which would  1 require a complete redesign of the project. 57 Enhanced achieved due to integrated sustainability  policies in Regional Official Plan and support by Peel  Region for various sustainability projects. Superior not  achieved due to lack of annual sustainability reporting  by Peel Region. No low hanging fruit since it will be a  challenge for the project team to have initiated annual  4 sustainability reporting by Peel Region. Although it can't be confirmed that no specific person  was given the responsibility of sustainability, it is  unlikely as sustainability is not addressed in the ESR,  and its irrelevant because a project must meet  criterion A through E for all levels of achievement.  Meeting criterion A through E would require an  extensive commitment to sustainability within the  project team through various business sustainability  processes, and given that sustainability as a concept is  not considered in EAs for road projects in the GTA in  my experience, such commitment is not considered  low hanging fruit. No ESRs in any ESRs reviewed for  this thesis even used the term sustainability except in  0 reference to the title of another document. The project achieved at most an enhanced level as  superior requires design charrettes with stakeholders  4 that did not occur.   Difficult to assess degree of stakeholder impact on  project due to lack of summary chart summarizing  comments from stakeholders and responses to  comments; It is likely that an enhanced level would be  achieved due to standard PIC engagement and project  management principles. Superior not achieved due to  lack of clear documentation proving the public had  5 meaningful input. No assessment of unwanted byproducts of nearby  facilities. Therefore no achievement. Not likely  0 relevant to road constuction so no low hanging fruit No evidence that project team sought to improve  project sustainability through project wide systems  0 integration; 2 year monitoring of infrastructure is standard and  likely to have occurred, but only monitoring of the  bridges beyond 2 years is standard, so no credit given.  Adding monitoring of the channel for an additional 35  3 years should be achievable and would earn Enhanced. No achievement since no documentation of  assessment of conflicting regulations and policies and  no evidence of sustainability objectives. Low hanging  fruit of Improved through basic assessment of  regulations and associated regulators and  organizations and connection to sustainability  1 objectives.

Likely achieved Improved by considering to some  degree the flexibility, durability and resilience of road  and culvert. Achieving Enhanced requires  documentation of consideration of future expansion  or reconfiguration which is given a low hanging fruit  3 score. 20 No documentation of an LCA and reasonable  assumption one was never done as I have never heard  of one occuring in my career for a municipal EA; a LCA  is very resource intensive so its not considered low  0 hanging fruit. No documentation of sustainable procurement, and  reasonable assumption this is not done in practice  outside of LEED projects; as it has been done for LEED  projects, it's a reasonable assumption that the lowest  level of improved could have been achieved through  <15% materials from suppliers with 'sustainability  2 practice' No documentation of EA or detailed design project  teams analyzing reuse of on site materials, but this  was likely done by contractor to reduce expenses. No  evidence of specifying materials with recycled  content, but its likely the contractor still purchased  materials with recycled content to reduce expenses.  Its standard for pavement and granular subgrade to  contain a significant percentage of recycled material,  so its safe to assume 20% (by weight or volume) of  materials on site are recyled. As credit may not be  given, the base score is zero. An upper score of  Superior is given based upon credit given for the  contractor purchasing but not specifying materials  with recycled content. A low fruit rating of Enhanced is  given as it should be easily acheived for the  municipality to specify materials with recycled  11 contact. No documentation for the  specification of local  materials, but with the cost of transportation its likely  a large percentage of materials were sourced within  the specified distances. Its unclear if achievement of  the credit requires explicit specification of local  materials by the contractor. If credit is acheived, its  conservatively assumed to be an upper acheivement  of Improved (30% local) and a low hanging fruit of  Enhanced (60% local). Achievement could have been  and could be much higher but I don't have evidence to  accurately assess so I've used a conservative  6 assessment. No base or upper achievement since no  comprehensive waste management plan likely  implemented. With recyclability of asphalt, granular  and concrete, its low hanging fruit to achieve 50%  recycle/reuse of onsite materials which gives a level of  enhanced. Actual low fruit achievement could be even  higher, but a more detailed analysis would be required  6 to support this. The level of achievement is based upon a percentage  of excavated materials  suitable for reuse  that are  reused on site. It is safe to assume that the vast  majority (90%) of fill  suitable for reuse  was reused on  6 site, giving an achievement of Conserving. As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly recyclable  so evalation criterion A is met which on its on leads to  a maximum achivement of Improved. Higher levels of  achievement require specific efforts to facilitate  future recycling which is highly unlikely to have  occurred, but with little extra effort due to the highly  recyclable nature of many road materials would yield  8 a rating of Superior for the low hanging fruit Even if options to reduce energy consumption were  considered, a basic Improved level requires a decrease  of 10% of energy consumption during operation over  industry norms, and must include energy consumed by  vehicular traffic. As the project adds general purpose  lanes to an existing road, this is unachievable so no  0 credit is given or possible.

No achievement since the vast majority of energy  used in the operation and maintenance of the road  will be fossil fuels. A very significant shift to electric  vehicles would be required because Ontario's  dominant Nuclear power is not a renewable resource  0 as per Envision. There is no documentation in the files review for the  EA or detailed design related to how the lighting  systems would be commissioned, but such  information isn't expected to sent to TRCA anyways. I  don't have sufficient knowledge of standard practices  in how municipalities commission and monitor lighting  standards to properly assess this credit. The likely  range of scores is too low to justify the effort required  to more confidently score this credit. So a  conservative range of none to Enhanced is given. The  next achievement jumps to conserving and requires  extensive commissioning and monitoring of systems  and as Conservative for any credit is intended to be far  beyond current standards of practice, I've assumed its  3 not low hanging fruit. No level of achievement. The project only assessed  groundwater conditions for the purposes of assessing  dewatering needs during construction which does not  meet many of the requirements of a water availability  assessment (criterion A). The project will not require  water takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore  no achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is given  since an analysis of groundwater and surface water  from the perspective of availability is not relevant to  0 this project. No level of achievement given as there is no evidence  of a potable water reduction strategy and it can be  assumed one wasn't done regardless as roads use  little potable water generally during operation and  maintenance. For roads, the only opportunity is the  use of drought resistant plants in planted medians or  boulevards to which stormwater is directed to  eliminate the need to water plants with potable  water; as such a redesign could be significant and I've  assumed significant redesigns are no low hanging fruit,  0 no low hanging fruit score given.

This is not the  0 case here, so no acheivement is given or possible. For the purposes of water quantity calculations the  existing road needs to be considered a greyfield.  Credit requires that water storage capacity be  maintained in the greenfield and must be improved in  the greyfield (existing road) by at least 30% for an  Enhanced rating.

No achievement given or possible without the  creation of a significant number of new jobs during  design, construction and operation. My opinion is that a municipality would never and  probably couldn not legally restrict a contractor to  hiring local workers; the most that could probably  be done is including a policy to look favourably in  the tendering process of contractors with a policy  of training and hiring needy or disadvantaged  workers No new sustainability technologies have been  proposed, so there's no opportunity to assess  associated Health and Safety implications;  therefore no achievement is given.

Level of improved given due to evidence of only  limited coordination with owners and operators of  adjacent facilities.

No low  hanging fruit since it will be a challenge for the  project team to have initiated annual sustainability  4 reporting by Peel Region. Although it can't be confirmed that no specific  person was given the responsibility of  sustainability, it is unlikely as sustainability is not  addressed in the ESR, and its irrelevant because a  project must meet criterion A through E for all  levels of achievement. Meeting criterion A through  E would require an extensive commitment to  sustainability within the project team through  various business sustainability processes, and given  that sustainability as a concept is not considered in  EAs for road projects in the GTA in my experience,  such commitment is not considered low hanging  fruit. No ESRs in any ESRs reviewed for this thesis  even used the term sustainability except in  0 reference to the title of another document. The project achieved at most an enhanced level as  superior requires design charrettes with  4 stakeholders that did not occur.

Difficult to assess degree of stakeholder impact on  project due to lack of summary chart summarizing  comments from stakeholders and responses to  comments; It is likely that an enhanced level would  be achieved due to standard PIC engagement and  project management principles. Superior not  achieved due to lack of clear documentation  proving the public had meaningful input. No assessment of unwanted byproducts of nearby  facilities. Therefore no achievement. Not likely  relevant to road constuction so no low hanging  fruit No evidence that project team sought to improve  project sustainability through project wide systems  integration; 2 year monitoring of infrastructure is standard and  likely to have occurred, but only monitoring of the  bridges beyond 2 years is standard, so no credit  given. Adding monitoring of the channel for an  additional 35 years should be achievable and  would earn Enhanced.

No documentation of EA or detailed design project  teams analyzing reuse of on site materials, but this  was likely done by contractor to reduce expenses.  No evidence of specifying materials with recycled  content, but its likely the contractor still purchased  materials with recycled content to reduce  expenses. Its standard for pavement and granular  subgrade to contain a significant percentage of  recycled material, so its safe to assume 20% (by  weight or volume) of materials on site are recyled.  As credit may not be given, the base score is zero.  An upper score of Superior is given based upon  credit given for the contractor purchasing but not  specifying materials with recycled content. A low  fruit rating of Enhanced is given as it should be  easily acheived for the municipality to specify  11 materials with recycled contact. No documentation for the specification  of local  materials, but with the cost of transportation its  likely a large percentage of materials were sourced  within the specified distances. Its unclear if  achievement of the credit requires explicit  specification of local materials by the contractor. If  credit is acheived, its conservatively assumed to be  an upper acheivement of Improved (30% local) and  a low hanging fruit of Enhanced (60% local).

No base or upper achievement since no  comprehensive waste management plan likely  implemented. With recyclability of asphalt,  granular and concrete, its low hanging fruit to  achieve 50% recycle/reuse of onsite materials  which gives a level of enhanced. Actual low fruit  achievement could be even higher, but a more  6 detailed analysis would be required to support this. The level of achievement is based upon a  percentage of excavated materials suitable for  reuse  that are reused on site. It is safe to assume  that the vast majority (90%) of fill suitable for  reuse  was reused on site, giving an achievement of  6 Conserving. As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly  recyclable so evalation criterion A is met which on  its on leads to a maximum achivement of  Improved. Higher levels of achievement require  specific efforts to facilitate future recycling which is  highly unlikely to have occurred, but with little  extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature of  many road materials would yield a rating of  8 Superior for the low hanging fruit

Even if options to reduce energy consumption  were considered, a basic Improved level requires a  decrease of 10% of energy consumption during  operation over industry norms, and must include  energy consumed by vehicular traffic. As the  project adds general purpose lanes to an existing  road, this is unachievable so no credit is given or  0 possible. No achievement since the vast majority of energy  used in the operation and maintenance of the road  will be fossil fuels. A very significant shift to electric  vehicles would be required because Ontario's  dominant Nuclear power is not a renewable  0 resource as per Envision. There is no documentation in the files review for  the EA or detailed design related to how the  lighting systems would be commissioned, but such  information isn't expected to sent to TRCA  anyways. I don't have sufficient knowledge of  standard practices in how municipalities  commission and monitor lighting standards to  properly assess this credit. The likely range of  scores is too low to justify the effort required to  more confidently score this credit. So a  conservative range of none to Enhanced is given.  The next achievement jumps to conserving and  requires extensive commissioning and monitoring  of systems and as Conservative for any credit is  intended to be far beyond current standards of  3 practice, I've assumed its not low hanging fruit.

Range of achievement of none to Improved as its  unclear if criterion A was met.

Not Applicable as there are no slopes of concern  present and no replacement of culvert or bridge  infrastructure that would typically warrant a  geotechnical investigation with slope BMPs Although more than 50% of the project is located  on an already developed area, it only makes sense  to count the existing road as a grey area if serious  planning consideration was given to new road  alignments entirely within greenfields. This is not  the case here, so no acheivement is given or  0 possible. For the purposes of water quantity calculations the  existing road needs to be considered a greyfield.  Credit requires that water storage capacity be  maintained in the greenfield and must be  improved in the greyfield (existing road) by at least  30% for an Enhanced rating. No achievement given  as no implementation of water quantity  improvement. No water storage or infiltration LIDs  were provided. As an overall improvement water  storage and infiltration over predevelopment  conditions is not achieved no credit is given. A  significant redesign would be required to achieve  this high standard and given my experience with  the resistence to implementing LIDs for roads, no  0 low hanging fruit score is given. With the Cosmetic Pesticide Ban Act, most  pesticides are banned in Ontario. Also, the project  would have planted only native, noninvasive  species that should reduce the need for fertilizer.

No achievement given or possible because the preferred  0 option limits community access and mobility No achievement given or possible because most of the  evaluation require don't make sense for a bridge  0 removal. No study of wayfinding and limited opportunity due to  limited pedestrian, and cycling traffic; the culdesacs at  either end of the removed bridge don't connect to any  0 trails, so there's no need for signage.

No public view plan was developed so no credit can be  given; as the area is developing the only areas relevant  for a viewshed may be the two watercourse crossings; a  1 basic viewshed plan would achieve improved.  No achievement and little opportunity within the project  0 scope for the addition to public space. 14 Goals and objectives of sustainability can be found in  many Toronto documents and initiatives with regular  reporting. Toronto expanding sustainability across the  organization, so future projects will be able to claim a  4 superior rating. Although it can't be confirmed that no specific person  was given the responsibility of sustainability, it is unlikely  as sustainability is not addressed in the ESR, and its  irrelevant because a project must meet criterion A  through E for all levels of achievement. Meeting criterion  A through E would require an extensive commitment to  sustainability within the project team through various  business sustainability processes, and given that  sustainability as a concept is not considered in EAs for  road projects in the GTA in my experience, such  commitment is not considered low hanging fruit. No  ESRs in any ESRs reviewed for this thesis even used the  term sustainability except in reference to the title of  0 another document. The project documentation does not mention  sustainability, however aspects of sustainable design are  found. However, the incorporation of results of the  Pedestrian and Cycling Master Plan and the  Transportation Master Plan shows some degree of  systems view. Low fruit is to more fully achieve  4 Enhanced. Stakeholders consulatation was througout project.

An additional option of a pedestrain  and cycling only bridge was assessed as a result of public  input . An achievement of Improved to Enhanced with  5 low hanging fruit of Enhanced. No assessment of unwanted byproducts of nearby  facilities. Therefore no achievement. Not likely relevant  0 to road constuction so no low hanging fruit No evidence that project team sought to improve  project sustainability through project wide systems  0 integration; 2 year monitoring of infrastructure is standard and likely  to have occurred, but only periodic monitoring of the  bank stability beyond 2 years is standard, so no credit  given. Adding monitoring of the watercourse for an  additional 35 years should be achievable and would  3 earn Enhanced. No achievement since no documentation of assessment  of conflicting regulations and policies and no evidence of  sustainability objectives. Low hanging fruit of Improved  through basic assessment of regulations and associated  regulators and organizations and connection to  1 sustainability objectives. Likely achieved Improved by considering to some degree  the flexibility, durability and resilience of bank  restoration.

No documentation of an LCA and reasonable assumption  one was never done as I have never heard of one  occuring in my career for a municipal EA; a LCA is very  resource intensive so its not considered low hanging  0 fruit. No documentation of sustainable procurement, and  reasonable assumption this is not done in practice  outside of LEED projects; as it has been done for LEED  projects, it's a reasonable assumption that the lowest  level of improved could have been achieved through  <15% materials from suppliers with 'sustainability  2 practice' No documentation of EA or detailed design project  teams analyzing reuse of on site materials, but this was  likely done by contractor to reduce expenses. No  evidence of specifying materials with recycled content,  but its likely the contractor still purchased materials with  recycled content to reduce expenses. Its standard for  pavement and granular subgrade to contain a significant  percentage of recycled material, so its safe to assume  20% (by weight or volume) of materials on site are  recyled. As credit may not be given, the base score is  zero. An upper score of Superior is given based upon  credit given for the contractor purchasing but not  specifying materials with recycled content. A low fruit  rating of Enhanced is given as it should be easily  acheived for the municipality to specify materials with  11 recycled contact. No documentation for the specification  of local  materials, but with the cost of transportation its likely a  large percentage of materials were sourced within the  specified distances. Its unclear if achievement of the  credit requires explicit specification of local materials by  the contractor. If credit is acheived, its conservatively  assumed to be an upper acheivement of Improved (30%  local) and a low hanging fruit of Enhanced (60% local).  Achievement could have been and could be much higher  but I don't have evidence to accurately assess so I've  6 used a conservative assessment.

No base or upper achievement since no comprehensive  waste management plan likely implemented. With  recyclability of asphalt, granular and concrete, its low  hanging fruit to achieve 50% recycle/reuse of onsite  materials which gives a level of enhanced. Actual low  fruit achievement could be even higher, but a more  6 detailed analysis would be required to support this. The level of achievement is based upon a percentage of  excavated materials suitable for reuse  that are reused  on site. It is safe to assume that the vast majority (90%)  of fill suitable for reuse  was reused on site, giving an  6 achievement of Conserving. As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly recyclable  so evalation criterion A is met which on its on leads to a  maximum achivement of Improved. Higher levels of  achievement require specific efforts to facilitate future  recycling which is highly unlikely to have occurred, but  with little extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature  of many road materials would yield a rating of Superior  8 for the low hanging fruit

Basic improved level requires a decrease of 10% of  energy consumption during operation over industry  norms, and must include energy consumed by vehicular  traffic. No credit can be given due to the lack of  consideration of energy savings during the EA; however,  some simple studies would achieve conserving as the  project eliminates traffic east of the river, and greatly  18 reduces traffic to the west of the river. No achievement since the vast majority of energy used  in the operation and maintenance of the road will be  fossil fuels. A very significant shift to electric vehicles  would be required because Ontario's dominant Nuclear  0 power is not a renewable resource as per Envision. Exclude credit as project does not propose an electical  system. No level of achievement. The project only assessed  groundwater conditions for the purposes of assessing  dewatering needs during construction which does not  meet many of the requirements of a water availability  assessment (criterion A). The project is anticipated to  require active dewatering to lower the groundwater  table to facilitate open trench construction of sections of  the watermain. The project will not require water  takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore no  achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is given since an  analysis of groundwater and surface water from the  0 perspective of availability is not relevant to this project.  No level of achievement given as there is no evidence of  a potable water reduction strategy and it can be  assumed one wasn't done regardless as roads use little  potable water generally during operation and  maintenance. No opportunity to reduce potable water  consumption during operation so no low fruit score  0 given. No level of achievement given or reasonable as the  monitoring of the water system is not a reasonable  request for this project scope which is limited to re routing a small section of an existing watermain. 57 The project has a net lower footprint than the existing  design through the removal of the bridge and footings,  but the culdesac on the north and dead end and  maintenance access roads on the south side are required  and need to expand beyond the previous footprint. No  achievement is given. No low hanging fruit is reasonable  because the reasonable design response is to  compensate for the lost cover, but credit isn't given for  0 compensation in NW 1.1. Access road is required to within 65 feet of the  watercourse so only a level of Improved is possible. A  100 foot buffer for Enhanced is not possible as the  1 access road is required. Not applicable as there's no adjacent farmland. Credit excluded as not generally relevant for the region,  with the exception of projects on the Niagara  Escarpment.

No public view plan was developed so no credit  can be given; however, viewsheds and the  maintenance of the rural character and  enhancements to the wetlands adjacent to the  road, in consultation with the community, makes  6 a level of Superior low fruit. Current project raises barriers for the public to  access Haynes Lake for fishing, so no credit is  given. The project could easily have incorporated  some limited, well design access off the paved  shoulder to Haynes Lake for a low fruit of  Conserving though support from the local  residents would be difficult to obtain given  current conflicts with individuals parking on the  11 should to access the lake. 52 York Region has their 2007 Sustainability Strategy  which informed their Vision 2051. No annual  reporting of sustainability progress so  achievement limited to Enhanced, with no low  4 hanging fruit Sustainability as a term does not appear in the  ESR, so I've assumed no sustainabilty  management system and associated processes  were in place for the project team (credits D and  E) and no credit is given. Given the prioritization  of the reducing impacts to the social and natural  environments over achieving transportation  capacity goals, I've assumed a simple  environmental management system would be  low hanging fruit of Enhanced. I've given  Enhanced or Improved as low hanging fruit on  the basis that if a team is to put some effort into  a EMS they might as well create one to the level  4 needed for Enhanced. The project documentation does not mention  sustainability. However, the thorough  enviornmental enhancements suggest  sustainability was given due consideration, so  credit of Enhanced given. Given the advanced  stakeholder involvement and the emphasis on  environmental enhancements, an achievement  8 of Superior would be low hanging fruit Facilitated stakeholder involvement through  advisory group, and clear documentation of  concerns and actions taken/not taken and why  achieves Superior. Achievement of Conserving  requires stakeholders to be an equal player at  decisions which is difficult to achieve so no low  9 hanging fruit score given beyond Superior No assessment of unwanted byproducts of  nearby facilities.

2 year monitoring of infrastructure is standard  and likely to have occurred, but only monitoring  of the bridges beyond 2 years is standard, so no  credit given. Adding monitoring of the channel  for an additional 35 years should be achievable  3 and would earn Enhanced. No achievement since no documentation of  assessment of conflicting regulations and policies  and no evidence of sustainability objectives. Low  hanging fruit of Improved through basic  assessment of regulations and associated  regulators and organizations and connection to  1 sustainability objectives. Likely achieved Improved by considering to some  degree the flexibility, durability and resilience of  road, culverts, and bridge. Achieving Enhanced  requires documentation of consideration of  future expansion or reconfiguration which is  3 given a low hanging fruit score. 32 No documentation of an LCA and reasonable  assumption one was never done as I have never  heard of one occuring in my career for a  municipal EA; a LCA is very resource intensive so  0 its not considered low hanging fruit. No documentation of sustainable procurement,  and reasonable assumption this is not done in  practice outside of LEED projects; as it has been  done for LEED projects, it's a reasonable  assumption that the lowest level of improved  could have been achieved through <15%  materials from suppliers with 'sustainability  2 practice' No documentation of EA or detailed design  project teams analyzing reuse of on site  materials, but this was likely done by contractor  to reduce expenses. No evidence of specifying  materials with recycled content, but its likely the  contractor still purchased materials with recycled  content to reduce expenses. Its standard for  pavement and granular subgrade to contain a  significant percentage of recycled material, so its  safe to assume 20% (by weight or volume) of  materials on site are recyled. As credit may not  be given, the base score is zero. An upper score  of Superior is given based upon credit given for  the contractor purchasing but not specifying  materials with recycled content. A low fruit rating of Enhanced is given as it should be easily  acheived for the municipality to specify materials  11 with recycled contact. No documentation for the specification  of local  materials, but with the cost of transportation its  likely a large percentage of materials were  sourced within the specified distances. Its  unclear if achievement of the credit requires  explicit specification of local materials by the  contractor. If credit is acheived, its conservatively  assumed to be an upper acheivement of  Improved (30% local) and a low hanging fruit of  Enhanced (60% local). Achievement could have  been and could be much higher but I don't have  evidence to accurately assess so I've used a  6 conservative assessment.

No base or upper achievement since no  comprehensive waste management plan likely  implemented. With recyclability of asphalt,  granular and concrete, its low hanging fruit to  achieve 50% recycle/reuse of onsite materials  which gives a level of enhanced. Actual low fruit  achievement could be even higher, but a more  detailed analysis would be required to support  6 this. The level of achievement is based upon a  percentage of excavated materials suitable for  reuse  that are reused on site. It is safe to assume  that the vast majority (90%) of fill suitable for  reuse  was reused on site, giving an achievement  6 of Conserving. As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly  recyclable so evalation criterion A is met which  on its on leads to a maximum achivement of  Improved. Higher levels of achievement require  specific efforts to facilitate future recycling which  is highly unlikely to have occurred, but with little  extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature of  many road materials would yield a rating of  8 Superior for the low hanging fruit Basic improved level requires a decrease of 10%  of energy consumption during operation over  industry norms, and must include energy  consumed by vehicular traffic. No achievement is  given as there's no evidence energy consuption  was considered. No low fruit score is given as the  project is in a rural area with little demand for  alternate transportation so reducing the  0 associated energy demand by 10% is unrealistic. No achievement since the vast majority of energy  used in the operation and maintenance of the  road will be fossil fuels.

No level of achievement given as there is no  evidence of a potable water reduction strategy  and it can be assumed one wasn't done  regardless as roads use little potable water  generally during operation and maintenance. For  roads, this the only opportunity is the use of  drought resistant plants in planted medians or  boulevards to which stormwater is directed to  eliminate need to water plants with potable  water; this project with a rural character does  not justify boulevard plants; however the project  does greatly reduce the need for salting,  generally done with a brine solution, as it should  eliminate the current issue of water overtopping  the road from the adjacent lake and freezing;  therefore with some analysis to support, a low  13 fruit score of Superior is given. Not applicable since project does not involve  potable water systems in its operation that could  be monitored. This criterion would apply if there  was an associated watermain. 52 Project avoided potential routing of Leslie Street  through prime wetland habitat. Leslie Street will  be shifted east.

Achievement of Enhanced since at least 50% of  developed area on greyfield. In this case the  existing road should count as a grey area as  serious planning consideration was given to new  6 road alignments entirely within greenfields.  The project paves the existing gravel shoulders  on both sides of road and maintains, relocates or  improves the existing ditches on both sides of the  road. However the ditches weren't designed for  quantity control, so no achievement is given and  the lowest achievement of Enhanced still sets a  high bar of 30% improvement over existing  conditions. In the absense of any calculations to  support what could be achieved, I have made a  conservative assumption that with  enhancements to the swales to improve  infiltration and capacity an overall increased  water storage of 30% over existing conditions  4 could be achieved for a rating of Enhanced. With the Cosmetic Pesticide Ban Act, most  pesticides are banned in Ontario. Also, the  project would have planted only native, non invasive species that should reduce the need for  fertilizer. With no documentation to support any  achivement, the project is given a base of 0 but  its possible they could have achieved a score of  Superior with the right documentation. No low  fruit achievement of conserving since an  integrated pest management  practice would  require a whole new region wide program be  developed. No achievement given as no monitoring of  groundwater quantity or quality during or post  construction and no low hanging fruit as there is  no compelling reason to undertake such  monitoring for this project. Project removes a low functioning wetland of  phragmites and replaces it with a higher  functioning wetland and terrestrial habitat of  native vegetation with appropriate wildlife  culverts, and improves water quality through  reduced salt usage on the road Achievement of Superior through landscape  plans that only propose native noninvasive  species. The project will remove the invasive  phragmites from the wetland but a detailed  methodology and management plan has not  been established; such a plan is likely to be  established during contruction due to the  extensive efforts required to remove the  Phragmites or would otherwise be low hanging  fruit. Project requires removal of large quantities of  peat and marl to facilitate road construction and  there are no plans to reuse this material on site  so no achievement is given or possible.

7 professionally facilitated meetings throughout  EA process with advisory group made up of local  residents, ratepayers, business owners,  environmental groups and heritage groups,  clearly achieving eval criterion A to F. Considered  previous work by Main Street Markham  Committe (similarly diverse in makeup). OP &  Traffic studies considered. Advisory Group  endorsement of preferred alterntaves (3  sessions). Achievement of Restorative hinges on an analysis  that the new street design will improve the local  economy of Main Street Markham sufficiently to  support a significant number of new jobs. I could  not find evidence of any such analysis so I've  given a base score of zero. My opinion is that a municipality would never  and probably couldn not legally restrict a  contractor to hiring local workers; the most that  could probably be done is including a policy to  look favourably in the tendering process of  contractors with a policy of training and hiring  needy or disadvantaged workers No new sustainability technologies have been  proposed, so there's no opportunity to assess  associated Health and Safety implications;  therefore no achievement is given. As other low  fruit score may require the use of new  sustainability technologies, there would be an  associated opportunity to assess the associated  Health and Safey implications so a conservative  low fruit score of Improved is given.  Achievement of Improved through consideration  and study of noise during construction and  operation. Achievement of Conserving would  require determination of noise goals of  community with mitigation and monitoring. With  extensive involvement of community with  contractor already done, it would be low hanging  fruit to have formalized this through approved  proprosals with community endorsement to  monitor and mitigate noise impacts during  construction  low hanging fruit of "Conserving". No base achievement as there's no evidence  specific efforts were made to reduce lighting  energy requirements; an upper score of improved  reflects the uncertainty in assessing credit B. A  low fruit score of Enhanced reflects a simple  assessment of lighting needs, during and post construction, installation of energy efficient light  standards, and basic efforts to reduce light  spillage. Achievement of Conserving through working with  local community to improve mobility and access,  especially during operation. Low hanging fruit to  better support the Conserving achievement could  be met through improved wayfinding to and from  the natural areas and trails of the Rouge valley  system that parallels main street to the west.

Achievement of Enhanced based on convenient  access to transit along route and road as part of a  bike friendly network. However, need separate  bike path and bike lockers to achieve Superior. In  time this project could achieve a conserving level  with bike paths and upgraded, visible transit  stopes with realtime transit info. These extra  items are low hanging fruit that could have been  achieved given the project location as a potential  destination for cycling and pedestrians. Low  hanging fruit of Conserving. No evidence of wayfinding measures planned or  added so no achievement. Wayfinding is low  hanging fruit. Low hanging fruit rating of  restorative, because extensive community  consultation was already done, so it just would  have needed to be slightly modified to deal  explicity with safety through environmental  design with appropraite wayfinding As the ENV SP on the project I would have  consulted with the Projec verifier to get  clarification on "significance" of enhancement  required to achieve Restorative. The project at  least achieved Conserving. By extension,  Restorative would definitely be considered low  hanging fruit. Despite meeting the intent of evaluation criterion  A through D, achievement could not clearly be  granted as the core of the Improved rating  requires a public view plan be developed; there  would need to be clarification from the Project  Verifier whether or not the existing heritage  district design guidelines would achieve the  Improved level, in which case the project as is  would likely acheive a Superior rating. The low  hanging fruit rating of Superior recognizes that  aspects of the criterion could be more clearly  achieved easily if the project were redone to  clearly acheive Superior.

With the project as is , it would likely achieve  Superior; I am fairly confidednt that the sidewalk  improvements, landscaping, additional benches  and small entrance gateway feature meet the test  of "meaningful" for  a superior level but am not  confident it would meet the test of "significanly  improving" needed to achieve Conserving.  In  order to better justify achieve a rating of  Conserving, the project would have to make the  case that in a historic downtown that functions as  a destination that sidewalks count as public space  and that improvements to sidewalks count  therefore as an improvement to public space.  With the extensive public consultation  undertaken, it would be relatively low hanging  fruit to add some more small public gathering  13 spaces to achieve the Restorative rating. 129 Markham has the Greenprint Sustainability Plan  and a Climate Change Action Plan, with a  dedicated web page and clear actions  undertaken; therefore a base and upper score of  Enhanced. The low fruit of Superior will require  annual reporting of sustainability, which is  9 planned for but not yet implemented.

Sustainability as a term does not appear in the  ESR, so I've assumed no sustainabilty  management system and associated processes  were in place for the project team (credits D and  E) and no credit is given. Given the prioritization  of the reducing impacts to the social and natural  environments over achieving transportation  capacity goals, I've assumed a simple  environmental management system would be  low hanging fruit of Enhanced. I've given  Enhanced or Improved as low hanging fruit on the  basis that if a team is to put some effort into a  EMS they might as well create one to the level  needed for Enhanced. The project documentation does not mention  sustainability, however aspects of sustainable  design are found.  The incorporation of various  plans shows some degree of systems view was  taken. Given the advanced stakeholder  involvement, an achievement of Superior would  be low hanging fruit Facilitated stakeholder involvement through  advisory group, and clear documentation of  concerns and actions taken/not taken and why  achieves Superior. Achievement of Conserving  requires stakeholders to be an equal player at  decisions which is difficult to achieve so no low  hanging fruit score given beyond Superior No assessment of unwanted byproducts of  nearby facilities. Therefore no achievement. Not  likely relevant to road constuction so no low  hanging fruit No evidence that project team sought to improve  project sustainability through project wide  systems integration; 2 year monitoring of infrastructure is standard  and likely to have occurred, but only monitoring  of the bridges beyond 2 years is standard, so no  credit given. Adding monitoring of the channel for  an additional 35 years should be achievable and  would earn Enhanced. No achievement since no documentation of  assessment of conflicting regulations and policies  and no evidence of sustainability objectives. Low  hanging fruit of Improved through basic  assessment of regulations and associated  regulators and organizations and connection to  sustainability objectives. Likely achieved Improved by considering to some  degree the flexibility, durability and resilience of  road, culverts, and bridge. Achieving Enhanced  requires documentation of consideration of  future expansion or reconfiguration which is  given a low hanging fruit score.

No documentation of EA or detailed design  project teams analyzing reuse of on site materials,  but this was likely done by contractor to reduce  expenses. No evidence of specifying materials  with recycled content, but its likely the contractor  still purchased materials with recycled content to  reduce expenses. Its standard for pavement and  granular subgrade to contain a significant  percentage of recycled material, so its safe to  assume 20% (by weight or volume) of materials  on site are recyled. As credit may not be given,  the base score is zero. An upper score of Superior  is given based upon credit given for the  contractor purchasing but not specifying  materials with recycled content. A low fruit rating  of Enhanced is given as it should be easily  acheived for the municipality to specify materials  11 with recycled contact. No documentation for the  specification  of local  materials, but with the cost of transportation its  likely a large percentage of materials were  sourced within the specified distances. Its unclear  if achievement of the credit requires explicit  specification of local materials by the contractor.  If credit is acheived, its conservatively assumed to  be an upper acheivement of Improved (30% local)  and a low hanging fruit of Enhanced (60% local).  Achievement could have been and could be much  higher but I don't have evidence to accurately  assess so I've used a conservative assessment. No base or upper achievement since no  comprehensive waste management plan likely  implemented. With recyclability of asphalt,  granular and concrete, its low hanging fruit to  achieve 50% recycle/reuse of onsite materials  which gives a level of enhanced. Actual low fruit  achievement could be even higher, but a more  detailed analysis would be required to support  this. The level of achievement is based upon a  percentage of excavated materials  suitable for  reuse  that are reused on site. It is safe to assume  that the vast majority (90%) of fill  suitable for  reuse  was reused on site, giving an achievement  of Conserving. As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly  recyclable so evalation criterion A is met which on  its on leads to a maximum achivement of  Improved. Higher levels of achievement require  specific efforts to facilitate future recycling which  is highly unlikely to have occurred, but with little  extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature of  many road materials would yield a rating of  Superior for the low hanging fruit Even if options to reduce energy consumption  were considered, a basic Improved level requires  a decrease of 10% of energy consumption during  operation over industry norms, and must include  energy consumed by vehicular traffic. As the  project adds general purpose lanes to an existing  road, this is unachievable so no credit is given or  possible. No achievement since the vast majority of energy  used in the operation and maintenance of the  road will be fossil fuels. A very significant shift to  electric vehicles would be required because  Ontario's dominant Nuclear power is not a  renewable resource as per Envision.

There is no documentation in the files review for  the EA or detailed design related to how the  lighting systems would be commissioned, but  such information isn't expected to sent to TRCA  anyways. I don't have sufficient knowledge of  standard practices in how municipalities  commission and monitor lighting standards to  properly assess this credit. The likely range of  scores is too low to justify the effort required to  more confidently score this credit. So a  conservative range of none to Enhanced is given.  The next achievement jumps to conserving and  requires extensive commissioning and monitoring  of systems and as Conservative for any credit is  intended to be far beyond current standards of  3 practice, I've assumed its not low hanging fruit. No level of achievement. The project only  assessed groundwater conditions for the  purposes of assessing dewatering needs during  construction which does not meet many of the  requirements of a water availability assessment  (criterion A). The project will not require water  takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore  no achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is  given since an analysis of groundwater and  surface water from the perspective of availability  0 is not relevant to this project. No level of achievement given as there is no  evidence of a potable water reduction strategy  and it can be assumed one wasn't done  regardless as roads use little potable water  generally during operation and maintenance. For  roads, the only opportunity is the use of drought  resistant plants in planted medians or boulevards  to which stormwater is directed to eliminate the  need to water plants with potable water; as such  a redesign could be significant and I've assumed  significant redesigns are no low hanging fruit, no  0 low hanging fruit score given. Not applicable since project does not involve  potable water systems in its operation that could  be monitored. This criterion would apply if there  was an associated watermain. 42 Some instances of S1, S2, S3 ranked species in  vicinity of Rouge crossings & ESA upstream.  Redside Dace habitat at Rouge crossing.  Therefore the habitat loss at the crossing is  considered a loss of prime habitat and an  achievement cannot be given. Furthermore,  encroachment into prime habitat would be  difficult to avoid so there is no low hanging fruit  0 to achieve No achievement given or possible since the  project widens the road within the specified  0 distance to a watercourse. Not applicable as there were no serious options  considered that would impact farmland. Credit excluded as not generally relevant for the  region, with the exception of projects on the  Niagara Escarpment.

Achievement of Improved through following  BMPs; no further acheivement possible since no  flexibility in siting. No achievement since less than 25% of developed  area on possible greyfield. Also it only makes  sense to count the existing road as a grey area if  serious planning consideration was given to new  road alignments entirely within greenfields. This  is not the case here, so no acheivement is given  or possible. For the purposes of water quantity calculations  the existing road needs to be considered a  greyfield. Credit requires that water storage  capacity be maintained in the greenfield and  must be improved in the greyfield (existing road)  by at least 30% for an Enhanced rating. No  achievement given as no implementation of  water quantity improvement. No water storage  or infiltration LIDs were provided. As an overall  improvement water storage and infiltration over  predevelopment conditions is not achieved no  credit is given. A significant redesign would be  required to achieve this high standard and given  my experience with the resistence to  implementing LIDs for roads, no low hanging fruit  score is given. With the Cosmetic Pesticide Ban Act, most  pesticides are banned in Ontario. Also, the  project would have planted only native, non invasive species that should reduce the need for  fertilizer. With no documentation to support any  achivement, the project is given a base of 0 but its  possible they could have achieved a score of  Superior with the right documentation. No low  fruit achievement of conserving since an  integrated pest management  practice would  require a whole new region wide program be  developed. No achievement given as no monitoring of  groundwater quantity or quality during or post  construction and no low hanging fruit as there is  no compelling reason to undertake such  monitoring for this project. No achievement given since no quanification of  vegetation loss or plantings provided,  compensation can't be effectively assessed. Low  hanging fruit of Conserving by quantifying loss  and proposed plantings and through channel  improvements at the highly degraded Mount Joy  Creek crossing just south of Major Mackenzie.  No achievement since no evidence of multi year  invasive species management plan. Not low  hanging fruit since multi year invasive species  management plan would require creation of new  region wide program; due to the extensive spread  of invasive species in Ontario, only a City/Region  wide program makes sense. No achievement since no evidence that 100% of  soils disturbed during construction have been  restored and reused. My experience is that there  is strong push back in industry against soil  restoration, especially regarding compaction, so  no low fruit score is given. Conserving achieved by maintaining or enhancing  4 ecosystem functions. Low fruit would be to  strengthen achievement of Conserving through  further resportoration of functions

York Region reviewed their OP, the local OPs  and the  2002 TMP, and held 2 fairly well attended public  meetings. However, although a summary table of some of  the comments received from PICs 1 and 2 and responses  was provided there was no clear alteration to project as a  result of public input. No achievement given because  there's no evidence to support that the local community  was meaningfully engaged (criterion D). Achievemement  of D requires communities be "meaningfully engaged" in  the project. Superier requires D and that all negative  impacts on the nearby community be reduced or  10 eliminated.  No achievement given or possible without the creation of  a significant number of new jobs during design,  construction and operation. My opinion is that a municipality would never and  probably couldn not legally restrict a contractor to hiring  local workers; the most that could probably be done is  including a policy to look favourably in the tendering  process of contractors with a policy of training and hiring  needy or disadvantaged workers No new sustainability technologies have been proposed,  so there's no opportunity to assess associated Health and  Safety implications; therefore no achievement is given. As  other low fruit score may require the use of new  sustainability technologies, there would be an associated  opportunity to assess the associated Health and Safey  implications so a conservative low fruit score of Improved  is given.  Achievement of Improved through consideration and  study of noise during construction and operation.  Achievement of Conserving would require determination  of noise goals of community with mitigation and  monitoring. With extensive involvement of community  during well attended PICs, it would be low hanging fruit to  have formalized this through approved proprosals with  community endorsement to monitor and mitigate noise  impacts during construction  low hanging fruit of  "Conserving". No base achievement as there's no evidence specific  efforts were made to reduce lighting energy  requirements; an upper score of improved reflects the  uncertainty in assessing credit B. A low fruit score of  Enhanced reflects a simple assessment of lighting needs,  during and postconstruction, installation of energy  efficient light standards, and basic efforts to reduce light  spillage. study of access during EA and detailed design in  consultation with local businesses and residents, a design  that supports the 2008 Pedestrian and Cycling Master  Plan and 2009 Transportation Master Plan, with a focused  effort during the well attended PICs to discuss access and  mobility with local businesses and residents should earn a  rating of between Improved and Enhanced. Superior  requires reducing traffic impacts during construction "well  beyond construction norms."

No achievement since no new public space and no low  hanging fruit since adding public space will challenging  0 within the proposed right of way. 35 York Region has their 2007 Sustainability Strategy which  informed their Vision 2051. No annual reporting of  sustainability progress so achievement limited to  4 Enhanced, with no low hanging fruit Although it can't be confirmed that no specific person was  given the responsibility of sustainability, it is unlikely as  sustainability is not addressed in the ESR, and its  irrelevant because a project must meet criterion A  through E for all levels of achievement. Meeting criterion  A through E would require an extensive commitment to  sustainability within the project team through various  business sustainability processes, and given that  sustainability as a concept is not considered in EAs for  road projects in the GTA in my experience, such  commitment is not considered low hanging fruit. No ESRs  in any ESRs reviewed for this thesis even used the term  sustainability except in reference to the title of another  0 document. The project documentation does not mention  sustainability, however aspects of sustainable design are  found. However, the incorporation of results of the  Pedestrian and Cycling Master Plan and the  Transportation Master Plan shows some degree of  4 systems view. Low fruit is to more fully achieve Enhanced. Documentation of some main comments from the public  and responses from project team from PICs 1 and 2. Both  PICs were well attended. No evidence of any design  alteration as a resut of public input. It is likely that an  improved level would be achieved due to standard PIC  engagement and project management principles. Given  the well attended PICs and that some effort was made to  document public comments, more thorough  documentation of public engagement and proof of design  alterations from public input would constitute low  5 hanging fruit of enhanced. No assessment of unwanted byproducts of nearby  facilities. Therefore no achievement. Not likely relevant to  0 road constuction so no low hanging fruit No evidence that project team sought to improve project  0 sustainability through project wide systems integration; No achievement because Improved required moniroting  plan beyond regulatory requirements, but the monitoring  plan is for this project would have been to satisfy DFO  requirements. Adding an extra year of monitoring beyond  the DFO Authorization requirements would achieve  3 Enhanced. No achievement since no documentation of assessment  of conflicting regulations and policies and no evidence of  sustainability objectives. Low hanging fruit of Improved  through basic assessment of regulations and associated  regulators and organizations and connection to  1 sustainability objectives. Likely achieved Improved by considering to some degree  the flexibility, durability and resilience of road, culverts  and underpassesnew channel. Achieving Enhanced  requires documentation of consideration of future  expansion or reconfiguration which is given a low hanging  3 fruit score.

20 No documentation of an LCA and reasonable assumption  one was never done as I have never heard of one occuring  in my career for a municipal EA; a LCA is very resource  0 intensive so its not considered low hanging fruit. No documentation of sustainable procurement, and  reasonable assumption this is not done in practice outside  of LEED projects; as it has been done for LEED projects,  it's a reasonable assumption that the lowest level of  improved could have been achieved through <15%  2 materials from suppliers with 'sustainability practice' No documentation of EA or detailed design project teams  analyzing reuse of on site materials, but this was likely  done by contractor to reduce expenses. No evidence of  specifying materials with recycled content, but its likely  the contractor still purchased materials with recycled  content to reduce expenses. Its standard for pavement  and granular subgrade to contain a significant percentage  of recycled material, so its safe to assume 20% (by weight  or volume) of materials on site are recyled. As credit may  not be given, the base score is zero. An upper score of  Superior is given based upon credit given for the  contractor purchasing but not specifying materials with  recycled content. A low fruit rating of Enhanced is given  as it should be easily acheived for the municipality to  11 specify materials with recycled contact. No documentation for the specification of local materials,  but with the cost of transportation its likely a large  percentage of materials were sourced within the specified  distances. Its unclear if achievement of the credit requires  explicit specification of local materials by the contractor.  If credit is acheived, its conservatively assumed to be an  upper acheivement of Improved (30% local) and a low  hanging fruit of Enhanced (60% local). Achievement could  have been and could be much higher but I don't have  evidence to accurately assess so I've used a conservative  6 assessment. No base or upper achievement since no comprehensive  waste management plan likely implemented. With  recyclability of asphalt, granular and concrete, its low  hanging fruit to achieve 50% recycle/reuse of onsite  materials which gives a level of enhanced. Actual low fruit  achievement could be even higher, but a more detailed  6 analysis would be required to support this. The level of achievement is based upon a percentage of  excavated materials suitable for reuse  that are reused on  site. It is safe to assume that the vast majority (90%) of fill  suitable for reuse  was reused on site, giving an  6 achievement of Conserving. As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly recyclable so  evalation criterion A is met which on its on leads to a  maximum achivement of Improved. Higher levels of  achievement require specific efforts to facilitate future  recycling which is highly unlikely to have occurred, but  with little extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature  of many road materials would yield a rating of Superior  8 for the low hanging fruit Even if options to reduce energy consumption were  considered, a basic Improved level requires a decrease of  10% of energy consumption during operation over  industry norms, and must include energy consumed by  vehicular traffic. As the project adds general purpose  lanes to an existing road, this is unachievable so no credit  0 is given or possible.

No achievement since the vast majority of energy used in  the operation and maintenance of the road will be fossil  fuels. A very significant shift to electric vehicles would be  required because Ontario's dominant Nuclear power is  0 not a renewable resource as per Envision. There is no documentation in the files review for the EA  or detailed design related to how the lighting systems  would be commissioned, but such information isn't  expected to sent to TRCA anyways. I don't have sufficient  knowledge of standard practices in how municipalities  commission and monitor lighting standards to properly  assess this credit. The likely range of scores is too low to  justify the effort required to more confidently score this  credit. So a conservative range of none to Enhanced is  given. The next achievement jumps to conserving and  requires extensive commissioning and monitoring of  systems and as Conservative for any credit is intended to  be far beyond current standards of practice, I've assumed  3 its not low hanging fruit. No level of achievement. The project only assessed  groundwater conditions for the purposes of assessing  dewatering needs during construction which does not  meet many of the requirements of a water availability  assessment (criterion A). The project will not require  water takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore no  achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is given since an  analysis of groundwater and surface water from the  0 perspective of availability is not relevant to this project. No level of achievement given as there is no evidence of a  potable water reduction strategy and it can be assumed  one wasn't done regardless as roads use little potable  water generally during operation and maintenance. For  roads, the only opportunity is the use of drought resistant  plants in planted medians or boulevards to which  stormwater is directed to eliminate the need to water  plants with potable water; as such a redesign could be  significant and I've assumed significant redesigns are no  0 low hanging fruit, no low hanging fruit score given. Not applicable since project does not involve potable  water systems in its operation that could be monitored.  This criterion would apply if there was an associated  watermain. 42 The Little Rouge, over which the bridge was recontructed  and widened, is identified as Redside Dace habitat in the  EA. As Redside Dace is an engandered species this makes  its habitat Prime Habitat as per the Envision definition,  0 and no credit is possible. No achievement given or possible as the site crosses over  0 several watercourses. No achivement given or desirable as the project expands  the road east onto farmland and creates a wider riparian  zone for the adjacent watercoure. The new feature  provides superior aquatic habitat and separation of  0 stormwater runoff from the road. Credit excluded as not generally relevant for the region,  with the exception of projects on the Niagara Escarpment. Achievement of improved through maintaining or  improving flood conveyance. No further achievement is  possible with the current design due to extensive  2 increases in impervious areas within the floodplain. Achievement of Improved.

As an overall improvement water  storage and infiltration over predevelopment conditions  is not achieved no credit is given. A significant redesign  would be required to achieve this high standard and given  my experience with the resistence to implementing LIDs  0 for roads, no low hanging fruit score is given. With the Cosmetic Pesticide Ban Act, most pesticides are  banned in Ontario. Also, the project would have planted  only native, noninvasive species that should reduce the  need for fertilizer. With no documentation to support any  achivement, the project is given a base of 0 but its  possible they could have achieved a score of Superior  with the right documentation. No low fruit achievement  of conserving since an integrated pest management   practice would require a whole new region wide program  5 be developed. No achievement since no monitoring of water quality.  However, with the extensive water quantity monitoring  plan in place (surface and groundwater), its low hanging  fruit to also monitor for water quality, in combination  with a spills prevention plan which was probably  developed by the contractor. Existing ditch was relocated further east, designed as a  natural channel with riparian plantings and natural  corridor, and stormwater flows from the road were  separated to improve water quality. The culvert under  Ninth Line was increased in size to facilitate wildlife  passage. Achievement of top score of Restorative. No achievement since no evidence of multi year invasive  species management plan. Not low hanging fruit since  multi year invasive species management plan would  require creation of new region wide program; due to the  extensive spread of invasive species in Ontario, only a  City/Region wide program makes sense. No achievement since no evidence that 100% of soils  disturbed during construction have been restored and  reused. My experience is that there is strong push back in  industry against soil restoration, especially regarding  compaction, so no low fruit score is given. Project maintains or enhances four ecosystem functions  for an achievement of conserving, and could achieve  restorative by enhancing water quality and proving that  the hydrologic connection and sediment transport were  improved.

Ajax reviewed their local and regional TMPs, and held 2 fairly  well attended public meetings. There's no discussion in the ESR  of Provincial Policy or Official Plans, so the project may not have  achieved any rating. ESR discusses comments from both PICs  and discusses them. There's no evidence that public comments  from project consultation resulted in any alterations to the  project, which would be a basic tenant of "meaningful  consultation". With broader, more meaningful consultation, a  5 rating of enhanced could have been achieved. No achievement given or possible without the creation of a  significant number of new jobs during design, construction and  0 operation. My opinion is that a municipality would never and probably  couldn not legally restrict a contractor to hiring local workers;  the most that could probably be done is including a policy to  look favourably in the tendering process of contractors with a  0 policy of training and hiring needy or disadvantaged workers No new sustainability technologies have been proposed, so  there's no opportunity to assess associated Health and Safety  implications; therefore no achievement is given. As other low  fruit score may require the use of new sustainability  technologies, there would be an associated opportunity to  assess the associated Health and Safey implications so a  2 conservative low fruit score of Improved is given.  No achievement since no consideration of noise impacts during  construction. Low hanging fruit of Improved if noise during  1 construction considered. No base achievement as there's no evidence specific efforts  were made to reduce lighting energy requirements; an upper  score of improved reflects the uncertainty in assessing credit B.  A low fruit score of Enhanced reflects a simple assessment of  lighting needs, during and postconstruction, installation of  energy efficient light standards, and basic efforts to reduce light  2 spillage. Achievement of improved to Enhanced based on limited to  satisfactory consideration of access and mobility during  planning and construction. Study of access during EA and  detailed design in consultation with local businesses and  residents, a detailed design that supports the Durham Regional  Cycling Plan, Transportation Master Plans, and Official Plans  with a focused effort during the well attended PICs to discuss  access and mobility with local businesses and residents should  7 earn a rating of Superior. Achievement of Enhanced based upon buses along Rossland  providing access to multi modal transit facilities, the restriction  of parking, and support for cycling connected to a cycling  network. An achievement of Superior requires secure bicycle  lockers at the transit stops, which would be a tough sell for their  3 expense relative to the bus stop use.

22 Durham Region has their stategic plan and Official Plan with  general sustainability statements. No annual reporting of  sustainability progress so achievement limited to Enhanced,  4 with no low hanging fruit Although it can't be confirmed that no specific person was given  the responsibility of sustainability, it is unlikely as sustainability  is not addressed in the ESR, and its irrelevant because a project  must meet criterion A through E for all levels of achievement.  Meeting criterion A through E would require an extensive  commitment to sustainability within the project team through  various business sustainability processes, and given that  sustainability as a concept is not considered in EAs for road  projects in the GTA in my experience, such commitment is not  considered low hanging fruit. No ESRs in any ESRs reviewed for  this thesis even used the term sustainability except in reference  0 to the title of another document. The project documentation does not mention sustainability,  however aspects of sustainable design are found. However, the  incorporation of results of the Pedestrian and Cycling Master  Plan and the Transportation Master Plan shows some degree of  4 systems view. Low fruit is to more fully achieve Enhanced. Documentation of some main comments from the public and  responses from project team from PICs 1 and 2. Both PICs were  well attended. Public involved consultation generally opposed  to project at both PICs and petition to local council. Give broad  and generally negative public views of project during  consultation and that no alterations to the project were made  as a result of public input, an acheivement of improved can be  given. With earlier, broader and more open consultation the  5 project may have been able to acheive a level of enhanced. No assessment of unwanted byproducts of nearby facilities.  Therefore no achievement. Not likely relevant to road  0 constuction so no low hanging fruit No evidence that project team sought to improve project  0 sustainability through project wide systems integration; No achievement because Improved requires monitoring plan  beyond regulatory requirements. However, if the argument can  be made that the 10 years was more than the minium required  for regulator approvals, then enhanced should be achieved.  Adding an extra year of monitoring beyond the DFO  3 Authorization requirements should achieve Enhanced. No achievement since no documentation of assessment of  conflicting regulations and policies and no evidence of  sustainability objectives. Low hanging fruit of Improved through  basic assessment of regulations and associated regulators and  1 organizations and connection to sustainability objectives. Likely achieved Improved by considering to some degree the  flexibility, durability and resilience of road, culverts and  underpassesnew channel. Achieving Enhanced requires  documentation of consideration of future expansion or  3 reconfiguration which is given a low hanging fruit score. 20 No documentation of an LCA and reasonable assumption one  was never done as I have never heard of one occuring in my  career for a municipal EA; a LCA is very resource intensive so its  0 not considered low hanging fruit. No documentation of sustainable procurement, and reasonable  assumption this is not done in practice outside of LEED projects;  as it has been done for LEED projects, it's a reasonable  assumption that the lowest level of improved could have been  achieved through <15% materials from suppliers with  2 'sustainability practice'

No documentation of EA or detailed design project teams  analyzing reuse of on site materials, but this was likely done by  contractor to reduce expenses. No evidence of specifying  materials with recycled content, but its likely the contractor still  purchased materials with recycled content to reduce expenses.  Its standard for pavement and granular subgrade to contain a  significant percentage of recycled material, so its safe to assume  20% (by weight or volume) of materials on site are recyled. As  credit may not be given, the base score is zero. An upper score  of Superior is given based upon credit given for the contractor  purchasing but not specifying materials with recycled content. A  low fruit rating of Enhanced is given as it should be easily  acheived for the municipality to specify materials with recycled  11 contact. No documentation for the specification of local materials, but  with the cost of transportation its likely a large percentage of  materials were sourced within the specified distances. Its  unclear if achievement of the credit requires explicit  specification of local materials by the contractor. If credit is  acheived, its conservatively assumed to be an upper  acheivement of Improved (30% local) and a low hanging fruit of  Enhanced (60% local). Achievement could have been and could  be much higher but I don't have evidence to accurately assess  6 so I've used a conservative assessment. No base or upper achievement since no comprehensive waste  management plan likely implemented. With recyclability of  asphalt, granular and concrete, its low hanging fruit to achieve  50% recycle/reuse of onsite materials which gives a level of  enhanced. Actual low fruit achievement could be even higher,  6 but a more detailed analysis would be required to support this. The level of achievement is based upon a percentage of  excavated materials  suitable for reuse that are reused on site. It  is safe to assume that the vast majority (90%) of fill  suitable for  6 reuse  was reused on site, giving an achievement of Conserving.

As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly recyclable so  evalation criterion A is met which on its on leads to a maximum  achivement of Improved. Higher levels of achievement require  specific efforts to facilitate future recycling which is highly  unlikely to have occurred, but with little extra effort due to the  highly recyclable nature of many road materials would yield a  8 rating of Superior for the low hanging fruit Even if options to reduce energy consumption were considered,  a basic Improved level requires a decrease of 10% of energy  consumption during operation over industry norms, and must  include energy consumed by vehicular traffic. As the project  adds general purpose lanes to an existing road, this is  0 unachievable so no credit is given or possible. No achievement since the vast majority of energy used in the  operation and maintenance of the road will be fossil fuels. A  very significant shift to electric vehicles would be required  because Ontario's dominant Nuclear power is not a renewable  0 resource as per Envision. There is no documentation in the files review for the EA or  detailed design related to how the lighting systems would be  commissioned, but such information isn't expected to sent to  TRCA anyways. I don't have sufficient knowledge of standard  practices in how municipalities commission and monitor lighting  standards to properly assess this credit. The likely range of  scores is too low to justify the effort required to more  confidently score this credit. So a conservative range of none to  Enhanced is given. The next achievement jumps to conserving  and requires extensive commissioning and monitoring of  systems and as Conservative for any credit is intended to be far  beyond current standards of practice, I've assumed its not low  3 hanging fruit.

No level of achievement. The project only assessed  groundwater conditions for the purposes of assessing  dewatering needs during construction which does not meet  many of the requirements of a water availability assessment  (criterion A). The project will not require water takings during  operation (criterion B). Therefore no achievemetn is given. No  low fruit score is given since an analysis of groundwater and  surface water from the perspective of availability is not relevant  0 to this project. No level of achievement given as there is no evidence of a  potable water reduction strategy and it can be assumed one  wasn't done regardless as roads use little potable water  generally during operation and maintenance.

14 Achievement of top score of Conserving The East Duffins Creek Crossing is across a defined valley with  sections of steep slopes. The elimination of the intesection jog  to the east requires a new crossing of Duffins Creek associated  with a new road alignment, south of the existing alignment. The  geotechnical investigations at the EA and detailed design should  suffice as requiring BMPs for work on the slopes for an  achievement of Improved. Conserving would require that the  alignment alternatives and design explicitly discuss the slope  hazard (or lack of hazard) at the various alignments considered  and that there be a confirmation of avoidance of high risk  6 slopes. Although more than 50% of the project is located on an already  developed area, it only makes sense to count the existing road  as a grey area if serious planning consideration was given to  new road alignments entirely within greenfields. This is not the  0 case here, so no acheivement is given or possible. Water quantity: project meets 2 to 100 post to pre (water  quantity test) for runoff to Urfe Creek; project meets retention  of 5mm for both Urfe and Duffins Creeks (erosion test). No  credit given as the credit requires improvements in water  storage capacity where this project can only maintain storage  and only for dishcarge to Urfe Creek, not Duffins. Given the  pushback in the industry on LIDs for roads, going beyond  regulatory requests would be difficult so no low hanging fruit  0 score given.

With the Cosmetic Pesticide Ban Act, most pesticides are  banned in Ontario. Also, the project would have planted only  native, noninvasive species that should reduce the need for  fertilizer. With no documentation to support any achivement,  the project is given a base of 0 but its possible they could have  achieved a score of Superior with the right documentation. No  low fruit achievement of conserving since an integrated pest  management  practice would require a whole new region wide  program be developed. No achievement given as no monitoring of groundwater  quantity or quality during or post construction and no low  hanging fruit as there is no compelling reason to undertake such  monitoring for this project. Achievement of Restorative through upsizing of two crossing  structures to improve habitat connectivity, including natural  channel design and riparian plantings at main watercourse. Achievement of Superior for planting of native, noninvasive  species. No further opportunities based on Environmental  Report at EA that did not identify an invasive species requiring  active management. No achievement since no evidence that 100% of soils disturbed  during construction have been restored and reused. My  experience is that there is strong push back in industry against  soil restoration, especially regarding compaction, so no low fruit  score is given.

No achievement given or possible without the creation of a significant  0 number of new jobs during design, construction and operation. My opinion is that a municipality would never and probably couldn not  legally restrict a contractor to hiring local workers; the most that could  probably be done is including a policy to look favourably in the tendering  process of contractors with a policy of training and hiring needy or  0 disadvantaged workers No new sustainability technologies have been proposed, so there's no  opportunity to assess associated Health and Safety implications;  therefore no achievement is given.

No base achievement as there's no evidence specific efforts were made  to reduce lighting energy requirements; an upper score of Superior  reflects the uncertainty in assessing credits B and C.

No base achivement since its unclear if credit can be given to this project  for adding to public space for retaining the Old Bailey Bridge because  access to the bridge is not being provided that will be for Rouge Park to  undertake in the future. If this project can be given credit for the Old  Bailey Bridge its likely an achievement of Enhanced was met for avoiding  impacts to the resource.  No further achievement is likely as Rouge Park  would want to retain control over any enhancements or alterations to  3 the Old Bailey Bridge. 41 York Region has their 2007 Sustainability Strategy which informed their  Vision 2051. No annual reporting of sustainability progress so  4 achievement limited to Enhanced, with no low hanging fruit Although it can't be confirmed that no specific person was given the  responsibility of sustainability, it is unlikely as sustainability is not  addressed in the ESR, and its irrelevant because a project must meet  criterion A through E for all levels of achievement. Meeting criterion A  through E would require an extensive commitment to sustainability  within the project team through various business sustainability  processes, and given that sustainability as a concept is not considered in  EAs for road projects in the GTA in my experience, such commitment is  not considered low hanging fruit. No ESRs in any ESRs reviewed for this  thesis even used the term sustainability except in reference to the title of  0 another document. The project documentation does not mention sustainability, however  aspects of sustainable design are found. However, the incorporation of  results of the Pedestrian and Cycling Master Plan and the Transportation  Master Plan shows some degree of systems view.

No documentation of EA or detailed design project teams analyzing reuse  of on site materials, but this was likely done by contractor to reduce  expenses. No evidence of specifying materials with recycled content, but  its likely the contractor still purchased materials with recycled content to  reduce expenses. Its standard for pavement and granular subgrade to  contain a significant percentage of recycled material, so its safe to  assume 20% (by weight or volume) of materials on site are recyled. As  credit may not be given, the base score is zero. An upper score of  Superior is given based upon credit given for the contractor purchasing  but not specifying materials with recycled content. A low fruit rating of  Enhanced is given as it should be easily acheived for the municipality to  11 specify materials with recycled contact. No documentation for the specification of local materials, but with the  cost of transportation its likely a large percentage of materials were  sourced within the specified distances. Its unclear if achievement of the  credit requires explicit specification of local materials by the contractor.  If credit is acheived, its conservatively assumed to be an upper  acheivement of Improved (30% local) and a low hanging fruit of  Enhanced (60% local). Achievement could have been and could be much  higher but I don't have evidence to accurately assess so I've used a  6 conservative assessment. No base or upper achievement since no comprehensive waste  management plan likely implemented. With recyclability of asphalt,  granular and concrete, its low hanging fruit to achieve 50% recycle/reuse  of onsite materials which gives a level of enhanced.

Higher levels of achievement require specific efforts to  facilitate future recycling which is highly unlikely to have occurred, but  with little extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature of many road  8 materials would yield a rating of Superior for the low hanging fruit Even if options to reduce energy consumption were considered, a basic  Improved level requires a decrease of 10% of energy consumption during  operation over industry norms, and must include energy consumed by  vehicular traffic. Although the project adds no additional vehicular  capacity, the road won't shift the modal split to transit and it has limited  0 opportunity to encourage cycling. No achievement since the vast majority of energy used in the operation  and maintenance of the road will be fossil fuels. A very significant shift to  electric vehicles would be required because Ontario's dominant Nuclear  0 power is not a renewable resource as per Envision. There is no documentation in the files review for the EA or detailed  design related to how the lighting systems would be commissioned, but  such information isn't expected to sent to TRCA anyways. I don't have  sufficient knowledge of standard practices in how municipalities  commission and monitor lighting standards to properly assess this credit.  The likely range of scores is too low to justify the effort required to more  confidently score this credit. So a conservative range of none to  Enhanced is given. The next achievement jumps to conserving and  requires extensive commissioning and monitoring of systems and as  Conservative for any credit is intended to be far beyond current  3 standards of practice, I've assumed its not low hanging fruit.

No level of achievement. The project only assessed groundwater  conditions for the purposes of assessing dewatering needs during  construction which does not meet many of the requirements of a water  availability assessment (criterion A). The project will not require water  takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore no achievemetn is given.  No low fruit score is given since an analysis of groundwater and surface  0 water from the perspective of availability is not relevant to this project. No level of achievement given as there is no evidence of a potable water  reduction strategy and it can be assumed one wasn't done regardless as  roads use little potable water generally during operation and  maintenance. For roads, the only opportunity is the use of drought  resistant plants in planted medians or boulevards to which stormwater is  directed to eliminate the need to water plants with potable water; as  such a redesign could be significant and I've assumed significant  0 redesigns are no low hanging fruit, no low hanging fruit score given.

Achievement of enhanced as large crossing structure avoids impacts to  floodplain function; however, impacts to riparian vegetation from  5 construction and bridge shadow are not mitigable. Achievement of Superior as large bridge structure spans Little Rouge  Valley to minimize impacts to slopes. No further achievement possible as  alignment is across steep valley slope and Conserving requires avoiding  4 all steep slopes Although more than 50% of the project is located on an already  developed area, it only makes sense to count the existing road as a grey  area if serious planning consideration was given to new road alignments  entirely within greenfields. This is not the case here, so no acheivement  0 is given or possible. For the purposes of water quantity calculations the existing road needs  to be considered a greyfield. Credit requires that water storage capacity  be maintained in the greenfield and must be improved in the greyfield  (existing road) by at least 30% for an Enhanced rating. No achievement  given as no implementation of water quantity improvement. No water  storage or infiltration LIDs were provided. As an overall improvement  water storage and infiltration over predevelopment conditions is not  achieved no credit is given. A significant redesign would be required to  achieve this high standard and given my experience with the resistence  0 to implementing LIDs for roads, no low hanging fruit score is given.

No achievement since no evidence of monitoring of water quality.  However, with the groundwater quantity monitoring plan in place to  monitor impacts to local wells, its low hanging fruit to also monitor for  water quality, in combination with a spills prevention plan which was  probably developed by the contractor. Project kept existing old Bailey Bridge crossing and abutments in Little  Rouge Creek and added a much larger bridge and abutments overtop.  Although vegetation compensation was provided, the bridge still results  in the net impact of a new crossign with associated shadow and now  impacts/barriers to the valley that cannot be fully mitigated. No  achievement beyond Improved is possible. Page 11 of Appendix C.4 of the ESR notes that although 38% of the  recorded flora are introduced, the vast majority are within the existing  road right of way. No achievement since no evidence of multi year  invasive species management plan. Not low hanging fruit since multi year  invasive species management plan would require creation of new region  wide program; due to the extensive spread of invasive species in Ontario,  only a City/Region wide program makes sense. No achievement since no evidence that 100% of soils disturbed during  construction have been restored and reused. My experience is that there  is strong push back in industry against soil restoration, especially  regarding compaction, so no low fruit score is given. Project only maintains one ecosystem function. Negative impacts to the  other 3 ecosystem functions due to the requried replacement of riparian  vegetation under the bridge with rip rap. This can't be avoided due to  shadow impacts from the bridge preventing vegetation growth.

As other low fruit score may require the use of new sustainability technologies, there would be an associated opportunity to assess the associated Health and Safey implications so a 2 conservative low fruit score of Improved is given. no achievement since no noise analysis; analysis would achieve 1 improved With Mississauga's new LED light standard conversion project support, which began in 2013, its a safe assumption that the project considered lighting needs, reducing energy consuption from lighting and reducing light spillage, for a score of Enhanced. Extra efforts to analyze lighting needs based on 4 zones would earn Superior. No achievement given as there is no evidence that mobility and access were considered in the EA or detailed design. No low fruit score because the project scope was limited to a short stretch of Torbram Road so the team could not be expected to 0 deal with mobility and access issues. Achievement of improved based upon buses along Torbram Road providing access to multi modal transit facilities and the restriction of parking. An achievement of Enhanced would require the addition of cycling facilities as part of a network 1 which is beyond the scope of this project.

Although it can't be confirmed that no specific person was given the responsibility of sustainability, it is unlikely as sustainability is not addressed in the ESR, and its irrelevant because a project must meet criterion A through E for all levels of achievement. Meeting criterion A through E would require an extensive commitment to sustainability within the project team through various business sustainability processes, and given that sustainability as a concept is not considered in EAs for road projects in the GTA in my experience, such commitment is not considered low hanging fruit. No ESRs in any ESRs reviewed for this thesis even used the term sustainability except in 0 reference to the title of another document.

No documentation of EA or detailed design project teams analyzing reuse of on site materials, but this was likely done by contractor to reduce expenses. No evidence of specifying materials with recycled content, but its likely the contractor still purchased materials with recycled content to reduce expenses. Its standard for pavement and granular subgrade to contain a significant percentage of recycled material, so its safe to assume 20% (by weight or volume) of materials on site are recyled. As credit may not be given, the base score is zero. An upper score of Superior is given based upon credit given for the contractor purchasing but not specifying materials with recycled content. A low fruit rating of Enhanced is given as it should be easily acheived for the municipality to specify materials with 11 recycled contact. No documentation for the specification of local materials, but with the cost of transportation its likely a large percentage of materials were sourced within the specified distances. Its unclear if achievement of the credit requires explicit specification of local materials by the contractor. If credit is acheived, its conservatively assumed to be an upper acheivement of Improved (30% local) and a low hanging fruit of Enhanced (60% local). Achievement could have been and could be much higher but I don't have evidence to accurately assess 6 so I've used a conservative assessment.

As asphalt, granular and concrete are highly recyclable so evalation criterion A is met which on its on leads to a maximum achivement of Improved. Higher levels of achievement require specific efforts to facilitate future recycling which is highly unlikely to have occurred, but with little extra effort due to the highly recyclable nature of many road materials would yield a 8 rating of Superior for the low hanging fruit Basic improved level requires a decrease of 10% of energy consumption during operation over industry norms, and must include energy consumed by vehicular traffic. As the project does not increase the capacity of the road and will reduce engine idling at train crossings and lighting energy needs, an upper acheivement of improved is given. The next level of achievement requires a 30% reduction in energy and my educated guess is this was not and could not be achieved 3 based on what the project has ability to influence.

RA 1.7

Yes - energey consumption was considered in the EA Reduce energy inasmuch as vehicular idling is consumption reduced. The proponent, Mississauga, considered energy consumption in its City wide support of LED street lighting

Unclear - the City claims that the LED lights will reduce energy costs by 55% over standard lights, and idling at the track will be reduced while not adding any capacity to the road.

Project involves two separate electrical systems. The underpasses both run on sump pump systems that handle 50 year storm. The LED lighting system in Mississauga is a system implemented and monitored by the City. The City does monitor the energy consumption of its LED lighting system. Achievement of top score of Conserving is possible if the project meets the Envision test of an independant commissioning of "the project". Its not clear what constitutes an 11 independant commissioning of the electrical systems. No level of achievement. The project only assessed groundwater conditions for the purposes of assessing dewatering needs during construction which does not meet many of the requirements of a water availability assessment (criterion A). The project will not require water takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore no achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is given since an analysis of groundwater and surface water from the perspective of availability is not relevant 0 to this project. No level of achievement given as there is no evidence of a potable water reduction strategy and it can be assumed one wasn't done regardless as roads use little potable water generally during operation and maintenance. For roads, the only opportunity is the use of drought resistant plants in planted medians or boulevards to which stormwater is directed to eliminate the need to water plants with potable water; as such a redesign could be significant and I've assumed significant redesigns are no low hanging fruit, no low hanging fruit score 0 given.

With the Cosmetic Pesticide Ban Act, most pesticides are banned in Ontario. Also, the project would have planted only native, non-invasive species that should reduce the need for fertilizer. With no documentation to support any achivement, the project is given a base of 0 but its possible they could have achieved a score of Superior with the right documentation. No low fruit achievement of conserving since an integrated pest management practice would require a whole new region wide 5 program be developed. No achievement given as no monitoring of groundwater quantity or quality during or post construction and no low hanging fruit as there is no compelling reason to undertake such monitoring for 0 this project. Existing watercourse and riparian habitat are of poor quality. Relocation provides opportunity to increase channel length, improve in-stream and riparian habitat and improve 16 connectiveity under the road for a score of restorative. Achivement of Superior through planting of native non invasive species, but no discussion of invasive species in Environmental Impact Assessment report despite identifying some. No low hanging fruit since management of invasives would require extending the study area far up stream and downstream due to the proliferation of non native and invasive species along the 5 stream reach. No achievement since no evidence that 100% of soils disturbed during construction have been restored and reused. My experience is that there is strong push back in industry against soil restoration, especially regarding compaction, so no low fruit 0 score is given. Project maintains or enhances four ecosystem functions for an achievement of conserving, and could achieve restorative by enhancing water quality and proving that the hydrologic 19 connection and sediment transport were improved. 59

No low hanging fruit since it will be a challenge for the project team to have initiated annual 4 sustainability reporting by Brampton. Although it can't be confirmed that no specific person was given the responsibility of sustainability, it is unlikely as sustainability is not addressed in the ESR, and its irrelevant because a project must meet criterion A through E for all levels of achievement. Meeting criterion A through E would require an extensive commitment to sustainability within the project team through various business sustainability processes, and given that sustainability as a concept is not considered in EAs for road projects in the GTA in my experience, such commitment is not considered low hanging fruit. No ESRs in any ESRs reviewed for this thesis even used the term sustainability except in reference to 0 the title of another document. The project documentation does not mention sustainability, however aspects of sustainable design are found. However, the incorporation of results of the Pedestrian and Cycling Master Plan and the Transportation Master Plan shows some degree of 4 systems view. Low fruit is to more fully achieve Enhanced.

No achievement since the vast majority of energy used in the operation and maintenance of the road will be fossil fuels. A very significant shift to electric vehicles would be required because Ontario's dominant Nuclear power is not a renewable resource as 0 per Envision. There is no documentation in the files review for the EA or detailed design related to how the lighting systems would be commissioned, but such information isn't expected to sent to TRCA anyways. I don't have sufficient knowledge of standard practices in how municipalities commission and monitor lighting standards to properly assess this credit. The likely range of scores is too low to justify the effort required to more confidently score this credit. So a conservative range of none to Enhanced is given. The next achievement jumps to conserving and requires extensive commissioning and monitoring of systems and as Conservative for any credit is intended to be far beyond current 3 standards of practice, I've assumed its not low hanging fruit.

Commission and monitor Unclear - although a sub-contractor energy systems would have installed and tested the light standards, and the municipality may have done its own check, its unclear either counts as an "independent commissioning" for the purposes of this criterion

Yes - the municipality would have sufficiently trained persons maintaining the light standards

Unclear - the Region would likely monitors the energy consumption of its lights but I don't have easy access to the information required to determine if this would constitute the advanced monitoring systems this criterion requires

Protect fresh water availability

No -although the EA assessed dewatering requirements for construction it was not from the perspective of assessing water availability to support water use so things like recharge weren't considered.

No - although there is no documentation of assessment water taking requirements beyond construction, it wouldn't have been done for long -term impacts as the project doesn't require water takings during operation

No level of achievement. The project only assessed groundwater conditions for the purposes of assessing dewatering needs during construction which does not meet many of the requirements of a water availability assessment (criterion A). The project anticipated "significant seepage of groundwater" as per the Geotechnical Report for the EA. The project will not require water takings during operation (criterion B). Therefore no achievemetn is given. No low fruit score is given since an analysis of groundwater and surface water from the perspective of availability is not relevant to this 0 project. No level of achievement given as there is no evidence of a potable water reduction strategy and it can be assumed one wasn't done regardless as roads use little potable water generally during operation and maintenance. For roads, the only opportunity is the use of drought resistant plants in planted medians or boulevards to which stormwater is directed to eliminate the need to water plants with potable water; as such a redesign could be significant and I've assumed significant redesigns are no low hanging fruit, no low hanging fruit score 0 given. Not applicable since project does not involve potable water systems in its operation that could be monitored. This criterion would apply if there was an associated watermain. 36 Not applicable because there's no prime habitat within the study area No achievement given or possible as the site realigns a 0 watercourse. No achivement given as the project expands the road east and west onto farmland; however the farmland is already slated for 0 residential development making this credit irrelevant. Credit excluded as not generally relevant for the region, with the exception of projects on the Niagara Escarpment.

For the purposes of water quantity calculations the existing road needs to be considered a greyfield. Credit requires that water storage capacity be maintained in the greenfield and must be improved in the greyfield (existing road) by at least 30% for an Enhanced rating. No achievement given as no implementation of water quantity improvement. LIDs were considered and dismissed in the ESR. No water storage or infiltration LIDs were provided. As an overall improvement water storage and infiltration over predevelopment conditions is not achieved no credit is given. A significant redesign would be required to achieve this high standard and given my experience with the resistence to 0 implementing LIDs for roads, no low hanging fruit score is given.

With the Cosmetic Pesticide Ban Act, most pesticides are banned in Ontario. Also, the project would have planted only native, noninvasive species that should reduce the need for fertilizer. With no documentation to support any achivement, the project is given a base of 0 but its possible they could have achieved a score of Superior with the right documentation. No low fruit achievement of conserving since an integrated pest management practice would 5 require a whole new region wide program be developed.

My experience is that there is strong push back in industry against soil restoration, especially regarding compaction, so no low fruit 0 score is given. Only achievement of Superior is given.

A life cycle carbon analysis would require extensive resources and I have never heard of one being done for a municipal class EA.
