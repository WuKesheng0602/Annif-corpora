INTRODUCTION 
STATEMENTOFPROBLEM


As climate change continues to challenge city resilience, it is important to focus on

creating cities that aim to proactively withstand these challenges. City builders must plan for growthinawaythatbuildsresiliencyandeconomicgrowththatissensitivetosustainability. PlanningforGreenInfrastructurehasbeenanexpandingfieldthroughoutthelastdecade,and itsimportanceasameasureforfosteringsustainablegrowthhasgrownexponentially.Urban GreenInfrastructure(UGI)providesanetworkofplannedandunplannedgreenspaces,within boththeprivateandpublicrealms,whichaimtooffsetthenegativeexternalitiesoftraditional `grey infrastructure' growth (Norton, et. al., 2015). This definition encompasses engineered solutions such as green roofs (Binstock, 2011), which have been proven to be an important component of adaptation and mitigation strategies, while creating immense environmental, economicandsocialbenefits. Realizingthesebenefits,theCityofTorontoestablishedtheGreen-roofBy-lawin2009, mandatingstricttechnologicalstandardsandprovidingdirectfinancialincentivesforvoluntary greenroofdevelopmentthroughtheeco-roofincentiveprogram(Forbes,2010).Followingbylaw implementation, publicly funded school boards were amongst the first to attempt exemptionfromlegislation,asthecostofimplementationandmaintenancewasostensiblytoo greatofabarrierwithoutfinancialsupports(Roberts,2012).Inresponse,theCityexpandedthe eco-roof incentive program to become applicable for schools seeking voluntary or mandated construction of green roofs. Although the policy has been heralded as a success in producing

1

green roofs on most commercial, industrial and institutional developments and building additions, school boards are still struggling to adhere to the by-law. As it stands, the City of Toronto is the only municipality in Ontario to have provincial permission to mandate the construction of green roofs, due to provisions outlined in the City of Toronto Act, 2006. However,recentchangestotheMunicipalActallowallmunicipalitiestopasssimilarby-laws. Conversely, the provincial building code lacks standards for green roofs, preventing this from coming into fruition (Ministry of Municipal Affairs, 2017a). The province is now looking to amend the Ontario Building Code for 2019, and has reported the possibility of including standards for environmentally friendly roof construction, enabling other municipalities to implement such regulation (Ministry of Municipal Affairs, 2017a). With these recent changes manymunicipalitiescouldsoonchoosetorequiregreenroofsoninstitutionssuchasschools. TheChallengesthatTorontoschoolboardsfaceinimplementinggreenroofscanhelpto informothermunicipality'swhomaychoosetoadoptgreenroofpoliciesorlegislation.There arecurrently4,900publiclyfundedelementaryandsecondaryschoolsinOntario,representing approximately 280 million square feet of space across the province (Ministry of Education, 2017). Unless solutions could be identified, these spaces in addition to newly built schools might never incorporate green roof technologies, resulting in a loss of opportunity to attain associatedenvironmental,economic,andsocialbenefits. Todate,verylittleresearchhasbeenconductedtoexaminethebarriersthatToronto school boards face in green roof implementation.

Growth in a number of North American cities is occurring rapidly, and the City of

Torontoisnoexception.Between2011and2016,TorontowasamongthethreeCanadiancities thatsawsignificantpopulationgrowthofover100,000people,withanincreaseof4.5percent toatotalpopulationof2,731,571peoplewiththistrendexpectedtocontinue(CityofToronto, 2017a).By2041,theGrowthPlanfortheGreaterGoldenHorseshoeforecasts3.4millionpeople and1.72millionjobsintheCityofToronto(MinistryofMunicipalAffairs,2017b).AsCanada's most populous city, Toronto has become the economic epicenter. The City is driving development and growth, experiencing surges in both residential and non-residential development (City of Toronto, 2017b). In a four-year span from 2012 to 2016, 363,859 residentialunitsand9.53millionmeterssquareofnon-residentialgrossfloorarea(GFA)were proposedintheCityofToronto(ibid).In2016alone,over$7billiondollarsworthofbuilding permits were sought (City of Toronto, n.d.[b]). The Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe directs municipalities to efficiently use existing land and infrastructure, by prioritizingintensificationandhigherdensitiesinurbangrowthcenters(MinistryofMunicipal Affairs,2017b).Torontohasconformedtothisdirection,as39%ofunitsproposedand41%of non-residentialGFAproposedwerelocatedintheDowntown&CentralWaterfrontCentre,36% of residential units were proposed in the Yonge-Eglinton Centre and 44% of proposed nonresidentialGFAwasproposedinNorthYorkCentre(CityofToronto,2017b). 7

Rapid developmenthasbroughtwithit:anincreaseintheamountofimpervioussurfaces,changesto the natural hydrology of land, increased occurrences of flooding, habitat fragmentation, damages on ecosystem and ecological processes, increased urban heat island (UHI) effects resultinginrisingurbantemperaturesandhasenhancedtheeffectsofclimatechange(Banting, et.al.,2005;Carter&Fowler,2008;Forbes,2010;Lehmann,2014;Mees&Driessen,2011).For decades investments in growth have been made through financing of traditional grey infrastructure;whichhasresultedindamagetowaterqualitythroughcasessuchascombined sewer overflow's (CSO), declining air quality, increased greenhouse gas emissions, declining biodiversity and much more (Binstock, 2011; Foster, Lowe & Winkelman, 2011). The consequences of our development choices are making it evident that now more than ever; thereisagrowingneedforchange.Greenroofshavebeenproventobepartofthesolution,as they are "structurally engineered and designed to combat urbanization" (Viijayaraghavan, 2016,744).

2.0GREENROOFTYPOLOGIES
 2.1GREENROOFSYSTEMS
 The City of Toronto considers green roofs as an extension of a roof that is a human-

made structure above grade, allowing the growth of vegetation designed, constructed and maintainedinaccordancewiththeTorontoGreenRoofConstructionStandard(CityofToronto, 2013a). Green roofs can be comprised of several layers (see figure 1): vegetation, growth substrate, filter fabric, drainage element, protection layer, root barrier, insulation layer, waterproofingmembraneandtheroofdeck(Viijayaraghavan,2016). Figure1:GreenRoofComponents       (Source:Viijayaraghavan,2016,744). Dependingonlocationandrequirements(ibid),greenroofmanufacturershavevariousgreen roof systems that meet the needs of different climatic conditions and users (Bianchini & Hewage, 2012). However, most green roof systems generally incorporate the vegetation, 9

growth substrate/growing medium, water retention, filter drainage, root barrier and roofing assembly/deckcomponents(ibid).Eachcomponentservesadifferentfunction,asdescribedin table1: Table1:FunctionsandComponentsofTypicalGreenRoofSystem Component Function RootBarrier Thisisthefirstlayerofagreenroof systemandactsasawaterproof membranefortheroofstructureand aimstoprotecttherooffrom penetrationofplantroots.

These systems are preferred in cases of building retrofits, as they often do not challenge the structural integrity of the building (Castleton, et. al.,2010).Specificfeaturesaredisplayedintable2:   11

They generally require more maintenance and irrigation, driving up associated costs (Peck, 2001; Lee, 2017). The advantages and disadvantages of intensive greenroofsareoutlinedintable3:  12

2.2COOLROOFS
 Due to the high costs associated with green roofs, alternative strategies to combat

challenges of urbanization have been widely sought. As a result, cool roof technology has gainedmuchprominenceinrecentyears.Coolroofsinvolvetheadditionofareflectivelayeror coatingaboveaconventionalroofinordertoreflectratherthanabsorbsolarradiation(William et.al.,2016).Thecapacityofthislayertoabsorbradiationfromthesunismeasuredthrough theSolarReflectanceIndex(SRI).CoolroofingmaterialsinTorontoarerequiredtohaveanSRI value of 78 (City of Toronto 2013a). The costs associated with cool roofs are similar to traditional roofs, in regards to both installation and maintenance (William et. al., 2016). However, cool roofs provide a reduced assortment of benefits in comparison to green roofs, primarily targeting a reduction in rooftop temperatures. As a result they also have a weaker abilityfortemperatureregulationincolderseasons,requiringincreasedenergycostsincolder climatesduetolackofinsulationandreflectionofsolarrays(ibid).

Greenroofsareknowntoreducethiseffectasvegetationandplantsprovidecoolingandshadingas well as reduce heat through evapotranspiration (Carter & Fowler, 2008; Lehmann, 2014). It has beenestimatedthatcitieswith50%to60%ofrooftopsconsistingofgreenroofshavetheabilityto lowersummertimetemperaturesbyapproximatelyfivedegreesCelsius(Forbes,2010).Aprevious study by Environment Canada found that "greening 6% of available roof space in Toronto would reducesummertemperaturesby1°Cto2°Coverall,"(Foster,Lowe,&Winkelman,2011,7). GreenRoofsalsoimproveairqualitythroughreducingairpollution(Carter&Fowler,2008; Peck et. al., 1999; Forbes, 2010). A study of the City of Chicago found that approximately 20 hectaresofgreenroofinthecitycouldremoveatotalof1.675kilogramsofairpollutantsayear (Kim,Hong,Koo,2012,8476).Greenroofvegetationalsohastheabilitytoreducecarbondioxide andgreenhousegas(GHG)emissionsbylesseningheatingandcoolingdemandsandsequestering carbon from the urban environment (Li, 2013; Foster, Lowe, & Winkelman, 2011). Green roof systemshavebeenfoundtosequester375gramsofcarbon(Kim,Hong,Koo,2012,8476). Green roofs are also an important component for stormwater management. Urban areas covered in impermeable surfaces are vulnerable to flood risk as the frequency and intensity of 15

precipitation worsens due to climate change (Mees & Driessen, 2011). Green roofs absorb large amounts of rainfall and stormwater runoff (Forbes, 2010), aiding to reduce the overburdening of stormsewersystems.ThisalsolowerstheriskofCombinedSewerOverflow(CSO),incaseswhere combinedsewersystemsareinplace.ACombinedsewersystemiswherestormdrainsandsanitary sewerlinesconnect;whenthissystemreachescapacity,partiallytreatedorrawsewagedischarge into water bodies, polluting water sources (Binstock, 2011).  Ontario has 107 combined sewer systemsandin2006and2007alone,thereweremorethan1000instancesofCSO(Binstock,2011).

Green roofs have been widely acknowledged as part of the solutioninaddressingstormwatermanagementconcernsduetoclimatechangeimpacts.Theycan onaveragereduceannualstormwaterrun-offby50-60%(Foster,Lowe,&Winkelman,2011,6).  Green roofs also create habitat for wildlife (Li, 2013; Peck et. al., 1999; Forbes, 2010) and

Furthermore, improved air quality, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, stormwater quality improvements, and other benefits significantly improve public health outcomes (Peck et. al., 1999, 9). Additionally, the improved aesthetics enhance livability and thusimprovehumanhealthandwellbeing(GreenInfrastructureOntario,n.d.). Green roofs also contain educational opportunities. This is extremely relevant to the case for adoption of green roofs across public schools in Ontario. Kudryavtev, Krasny, & Stedman(2012)studiedtheimpactofurbanenvironmentaleducationprogramsonyouthina New York City neighbourhood and found that interventions such as environmental education cannurtureasenseofplaceandfosterenvironmentalawarenessandbehaviors(9).Li(2013) argues that green roofs provide an opportunity for students to learn about plant science, wildlifehabitat,watercycles,andmuchmore.Shesuggeststhatgreenroofscanbecomepart of an important interactive program that teaches students about nature and life sciences, instilling environmental knowledge. Two case studies in the United States were used to illustrate this point, both existent in New York City: Bronx Design and Construction Academy andCalhounSchool.TheformerwasfundedthroughgrantsfromtheCitygardenclubandNew YorkStateDepartmentofEnvironmentalConservation,andthelatterwasbuiltasanaddition to an existing school building. Both schools incorporated the green roofs within various

programs, including "environmental science, plant biology, and ecology" (Li, 2013, 39). This demonstratesthatthereisanintersectionbetweengreenroofsandeducationalbenefits.

3.3ECONOMICBENEFITS
Green roofs produce economic benefits for the green economy, and for private developersandpropertyowners.Fortheformer,theexpansionofgreenroofpoliciessuggests thattherewillbearisingneedwithinthemarketforthegreenconstructionsector.Thisneed results in employment opportunities in the construction, maintenance, and engineering of green roofs (Merk, et. al., 2012; Kim, Hong, & Koo, 2012). For the latter, green roof implementationresultsinlowerHVACcosts,reductionsinenergycostsbywayofbyshading andevaporativecoolinginthesummerandinsulationinthewinter(Merk,et.al.,2012;Pecket. al., 1999). On a Municipal level, green roofs can help save millions of dollars in flood losses (GreenInfrastructureOntario,n.d.). Exploringtheeconomicbenefitsthatgreenroofscanproduceisvitaltothisstudy.Itcreates astrongcaseforimplementinggreenroofspolicies,ascostsofgreenroofsaretypicallytheprime barrierfacedinimplementation(Lee,2017).Greenroofsarepartofthegreeneconomy,andpolicy expansion in this area results in expansion within the industry. Consequently, green roof policy expansioncanleadtoincreasedjobcreation(Kim,Hong,&Koo,2012).Arecentreportreleasedby the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (2011) outlines six priority areas for building Canada's green economy. Green roofs can be identified in two of these six areas: energy efficiency of buildingsandwaterconservationandwastewatertreatment.Sincebuildingsareamajorsourceof GHG emissions, they state that an increase in energy efficiency of buildings can reduce operating costsaswellasboosttheeconomy.Aspreviously,greenroofscanproducesuchimprovementsin 18

Priortoimplementingaby-law,theCityofTorontoestimatedthatgreenroofinstallationscitywide could save an initial $313,100,000 and $37,130,000 annually (Foster, Lowe, & Winkleman, 2011).

In the context of school infrastructure,Weekes(2009)determinedthatitcostsapproximately$8billiondollarstoheat and light school across the United States (256). He concluded that green schools would be a viableinvestmentandsolutiontoreduceenergycostsandlowermaintenanceneeds,through new design and construction as well as renovation and restoration of existing buildings (Weekes,2009,257).             20

beingthefirsttoinitiateaby-lawtoenforcegreenroofconstruction.Thissectionwillexplore the process of green roof policy development in the City. The importance of evaluating this process lies in the ability to assess the role of Toronto School boards in the development of green roof regulation.  Uncovering the extent to which school boards where involved in this process allows deeper insight into the issues school boards have faced regarding green roof implementation.

4.1CITYOFTORONTO'SGREENROOFSTRATEGY
 The City of Toronto's green roof policy initially emerged from three environmental

policies:Toronto'sOfficialPlan,the2000WetWeatherFlowManagementMasterPlan,andthe 2001EnvironmentalPlan(Banting,et.al.,2005;Lawloret.al.,2006;Lee,2017).The2000Wet WeatherFlowManagementMasterPlanidentifiedaneedtofindstrategiesthataimtoprevent andreducestormwaterrun-offwithintheCity(Lawloret.al.,2006).The2001Environmental Planidentifiedaneedforstrategiesthataimedtoencouragegreenroofsandgardenstoaidin the reduction of the urban heat island effect (ibid). Finally, Toronto's Official Plan acknowledged the need for solutions that would address the City's environmental issues in areas such as stormwater management. To accomplish the aforementioned goals, the City conducted A Toronto Green Roof Feasibility Study (2000) that led to support for and the construction of two green roof demonstration projects, located at Toronto City Hall and the Eastview Community Center (Lawlor et. al., 2006). This led to the pursuit of extensive 21

stakeholder engagement and public meetings regarding the implementation of green roofs withintheCity,aswellasagreenroofcost-benefitanalysisfortheCityofTorontoconducted by Ryerson University (ibid). On November 23, 2005, the findings and proposed options for green roof implementation were presented as a discussion paper--Making Green Roofs Happen-- prepared by the City's planning department to Toronto's Roundtable on the Environment(Lee,2017;CityofToronto,2008a).Asaresultofasetofrecommendationsfrom Toronto's Roundtable on the Environment, City Council adopted a Green Roof Strategy on February1,2006.Theinitiativesofthestrategywerecategorizedinfourways(CityofToronto, 2008a): I.

In 2007, the programincreaseditsallocationto50$persquaremeterofgreenroofinstalled,andexpanded itsapplicationtoinstitutional,commercialandindustrialdevelopmentonaoneyearpilotbasis (City of Toronto, 2008b). It also established a funding cap of $10,000 for residential projects,

22

and $100,000forinstitutionalandcommercialprojects(CityofToronto,2008b).Bytheendof 2007,theprogramaidedthedevelopmentof46greenroofprojectsintheCity(CityofToronto, 2008c). 4.1.2USEOFTHEDEVELOPMENTPROCESSTOENCOURAGEGREENROOFS  To encourage the construction of green roofs through the development process, in

2007, the City of Toronto approved zoning by-law amendments and site plan control applications in regards to 14 sites (Lee, 2017). Amongst the sites, four were commercial buildings, eight were mixed-use buildings (residential and commercial), two were condominiums, one senior complex, one live work unit and finally, and one school building (CityofToronto,2008a). 4.1.3GREENROOFSINSTALLATIONONCITYOWNEDBUILDINGS  As part of the Green Roof Strategy, green roofs were to be installed on city-owned

buildings and facilities during roof replacement or on new construction, where it could be deemedfeasibleandpractical(CityofToronto,2008a).Later,thetermfeasiblewasremoved from the strategy as the cost for new facilities considering green roof construction could be accountedforincapitalbudgets.However,"practicality"remainedsincestructuralortechnical issues could impact opportunities for green roof construction on existing facilities (ibid). New build city facilities have since become subject to the Toronto Green Standard (TGS), under whichtheymustincorporategreenroofconstruction.   23

4.1.4PUBLICEDUCATIONANDPROMOTION  To promote green roof construction and enhance awareness of green roof benefits

across the City, multiple initiatives were implemented. Firstly, the City launched a green roof websitewhereinformationregardinggreenroofs,theincentiveprogramandlinkstorelevant websites, contact information and the cost benefit analysis conducted were disseminated. Furthermore,twotrainingsessionswereheldforCitystaffinvariousdepartmentssuchasCity planning and Toronto Building to teach staff about green roof benefits, design and construction.TheCityalsoheldanadditionalsessionforTorontoSchoolBoards.

It equipped Council with the power to establish by-laws to govern issues relatingtohealthsafetyaswellaseconomic,socialandenvironmentalwellbeing(Ministryof Municipal Affairs, 2015). COTA provided the City of Toronto with an alternative method of establishinggreenroofs,beyondtheapproachesidentifiedintheGreenRoofStrategy.  Priortoitsadoption,Section35oftheOntario BuildingCodeAct,1992 preventedthe

CityofTorontofromrequiringtheconstructionofgreenroofsbymandatingthatmunicipalbylaws not exceed the requirements set out in the provincial building code (City of Toronto, 2007a).Sincethebuildingcodelackeddirectionforgreenroofstandards,theCityofToronto was restricted in passing a by-law to govern their construction. Section 108 of the City of Toronto Act, 2006 (see figure 2), allowed the City an exemption from the aforementioned building code regulation, creating the opportunity to utilize regulatory tools for green roof implementation(CityofToronto,2007a).

Furthermore, a GreenRoofTechnicalAdvisoryCommitteecomprisedofgreenroofexpertswasestablishedto guidepotentialamendmentsarisingfromconsultationfeedback. 5.1.3ESTABLISHINGREGULATION The results of the aforementioned processes led to the development of a draft Green Roof By-law, including the Toronto Green Roof Construction Standard (TGRCS) considered by thePlanningandGrowthCommitteeonApril14,2009.TheCommitteerecommendedthatCity Councilamend the CityofTorontoMunicipalCodetorequireand govern theconstruction of 28

Chapter 492 of the Toronto Municipal Code now mandates the By-law (By-law 5832009).TheTorontoGreenRoofConstructionStandard(TGRCS)wasadoptedintosection492-8 and 492-9. Its main purpose is to set out the minimum construction and maintenance requirementofgreenroofs,whilestillmeetingtherequirementsoftheOntarioBuildingCode (City of Toronto, 2013a).

Due to the large size of most industrial buildings and policies protecting employment uses withinthecity,itwasdecidedthatindustrialbuildingswouldonlyneedtoprovideamaximum greenroofareaof10%ofthetotalavailableroofareatoamaximumsizeof2,000m²(Cityof Toronto, 2009c). By reducing the size of green roofs required on industrial building, the City aimed to alleviate a large portion of the cost burden. The City also conducted a Green Roof Alternatives Study in 2010 that looked to identify alternative technologies or treatments that couldachievesimilargoalsasagreenroofatalowercost.Thestudydeterminedthatnosingle alternativescouldachievethis,howeveracombinationofalternativestargetingtheurbanheat island effect and stormwater management objectives could potentially achieve similar outcomes(CityofToronto,2012a).Thisledtoanamendmentinthegreenroofby-lawtoallow 31

success of the green roof pilot incentive program, providing direct incentives to encourage voluntary construction of green roofs (City of Toronto, 2008b). The level of funding was maintained from the pilot program, allocating an incentive of $50 per square metre up to a maximum of $100,000 towards voluntary green roof construction. Cool roofs were also now includedintheincentiveprogram,withanincentiverangingfromtwotofivedollarspersquare meteruptoamaximumof$50,000(ibid).In2010,theEco-RoofIncentiveProgramwasrevised in order to be consistent with the Green Roof By-law as well as newly established green buildingstandardsintheCity.Thechangesincludedtheeligibilityremovalofnewcommercial and institutional buildings, instead opening up funding for commercial and institutional developmentsunder2000meterssquaredofgrossfloorarea,whicharenotcapturedbythe Green Roof By-law (City of Toronto, 2010). In 2012, City Council established the `Eco-Roof FinancialAssistanceReserveFund'toallocatetheproceedsgarneredthroughthecash-in-lieu policytowardsgrantsforbuildingseligiblefortheeco-roofincentiveprogram(CityofToronto, 2012b).

In 2013, the City revised the program by increasing the incentive level for the

construction of green roofs to $75 per square meter and granting residential buildings not coveredundertheby-laweligibilityforfunding(CityofToronto,2013b).In2016,theincentive levelwasincreasedoncemoreupto$100persquaremeter.Inaddition,CityCounciladdedan additionalgranttosupportstructuralassessmentsforgreenroofprojectsuptoamaximumof $1000 and added a requirement for City staff to submit recommendations for approval of funding requests greater than $50,000 for cool roofs and $100,000 for green roofs (City of Toronto, 2016). This funding cap was subsequently removed. In the same year the City once again requested the Government of Ontario to align school capital budget allowances to aid schoolboardsinfurthermeetingthegreenroofregulations,howeverthistimetheyalsoasked thatitbealignedwithOntario'sownnewClimateChangeStrategyandActionPlan.Thispolicy willbeintroducedanddiscussedinchapter8.0.ItisimportanttonotethattheGovernmentof OntariohasstillnottakenanymeasurestosupporttheaboverecommendationfromToronto CityCouncil.

Sites with over 2000 square metres in proposednon-residentialGFAwerethenextractedfromthisdataset.  Green roof building permit data was also retrieved from Open Data Toronto, as

provided by the Toronto Building Plan Review Section. This data set provides more in depth informationregardingdevelopmentdetails,suchasadescriptionoftheapplication,thegreen roofarearequiredandthegreenroofareaprovided.ApplicationspertainingtoTorontoPublic School Boards for green roof permits and variances were then extracted from this data set.

34

Furthermore,dataondocumentationregardingTorontoSchoolBoardcash-in-lieuapplications wasretrievedfromtheCityofToronto'sEnvironmentalplanningfiles.  Once all application building and site data was collected, data was sought from IBMS

(City of Toronto's internal application tracking software) and the Application Information Center in order to verify and update information retrieved from previous sources. These documentsincludethevarianceorfullexemptionletteraddressedtotheChiefPlannerthatthe applicantmustprovidethroughthecash-in-lieuprocessandthenoticeofdecisionissuedbythe ChiefPlanner'sofficeinresponse.Finally,plannerslistedupontheapplicationswerecontacted directlyinordertoattainandretrievetheabovedocumentation,ifpreviouslyunavailablevia otherresources.




Once culminating data was collected and all necessary documentation regarding

This was to determine the proportion of applications providing a full green roof, a partial green roof, or no green roof. Additionally, documentation pertaining to the cash-in-lieu process was analyzed to examine reasonsbehindoptingtoprovidecash-in-lieuratherthanprovidingagreenroofonsite.

systems. This acts a strong barrier against private investment and action (Mees, et. al. 2012; Adgeretal.,2009;Gifford,2011;Mendelsohn,2000).Thereisagenerallackofawarenessof maintenance costs and requirements, making building owners uncomfortable with the uncertaintyofacceptingsuchcosts(Vijayaraghavan,2016).Itisoftentimesdifficultforbuilding owners to obtain an upfront estimate on their return on investment, and when such information is available, it could be complex and hard to comprehend (ibid). Additionally, qualitativebenefitsofgreenroofssuchasincreasedamenityspace,aesthetics,ecologicaland psychological benefits are difficult to quantify (Getter & Rowe, 2006).  This results in less knowledgeforbuildingownersofwhatthesebenefitscouldtranslateinto.Moreover,alackof understandingofthebenefitsofgreenroofsextendsacrossvariousstakeholders.Pecket.al. (1999)suggestedthatpolicymakers,thedevelopmentindustry,professionals,researchersand the general public need access to detailed information (both quantifiable and qualitative) regardingthebenefitsofgreenroofs.Getter&Rowe(2006)advisethatlackofawarenessof greenroofbenefitsandcostscanbealleviatedthrougheducationaswellasindustrygrowthin NorthAmerica.  The City of Toronto initiated demonstration projects early in the policy development

In addition, as previously mentioned in the policy 44

development chapter, the City also implemented multiple initiatives to enhance public education and promotion of green roof benefits. This included the creation of a green roof websiteaswellasinformationsessions.However,areviewoftheEco-RoofIncentiveProgram byLuraConsultingin2016,determinedthatthisbarrierstillexists. 7.1.2COSTOFINSTALLATIONANDMAINTENANCE  Thebiggestbarrieringreenroofimplementationhasbeenidentifiedasfinancialcost,

includingupfrontinstallationcostsandmaintenancecosts.Installationcostsforgreenroofsare generally double that of conventional roofs, however, the lifetime of a green roof is also approximately double that of a conventional roof (Getter & Rowe, 2006). The cost of installation can vary significantly across regions, depending on type of green roof system, location, labor, equipment used, as well as extra costs associated with disposal, maintenance and operation (Vijayaraghavan, 2016). Ngan (2004) argues that there are various tradeoff's associatedwithdecisionstoadoptonetypeofgreenroofsystemoveranother.Whileintensive greenroofsgenerallycostmoretoinstallandmaintain,theyalsoresultinhighercostsavings overthelifespanofagreenroofsystem(Ngan,2004).  Peck et. al. (1999) assert that there is a lack of detailed information about costs,

exacerbating problems related to the lack of knowledge regarding benefits of green roofs; especiallyduetoalackofunderstandingofdirecttangiblelong-termeconomicbenefits(ibid). The information that does exist often relays scattered results and are context dependent. Castleton, et. al. (2010) drew data from various projects, consulting firm reports, green roof companies and the Green Roof Centre in the United Kingdom to measure the approximate

45

costs associated with the installation of green roofs. They determined that each source reported different ranges of price based on specifications, variants and suggested costs, and ultimatelyaveragedareasonablecostestimateof£150/m2in2010.Bianchini&Hewage(2012) reportedthatthe2012costofextensiveroofsinBritishColumbia,variedbetween$130-$165 per m2, while the cost of standard intensive green roof started at around $540/m2. Peck & Kuhn(n.d.)reportedtheinstallationcostsofextensiveroofsasstartingfrom$215/m2andthe installation of intensive green roofs at $323/m2. The Environmental Protection Agency in the US reported annual maintenance costs of green roofs at approximately $8/m2, while acknowledgingthatthesecostscouldbehigherdependingonvegetationtypes,andproperties such as planting media and drainage systems used (Environmental Protection Agency, 2017; William,et.al.,2016).  William, et. al. (2016) used simulations and modeling approaches to calculate the life

cycle costs of green roofs, cool roofs and conventional roofs in central Illinois, looking specificallyatinstallation,maintenanceandenergycosts.Theyfoundthatintensivegreenroofs resultedinthehighestenergysavingsbuthighestannualcost,whileextensivegreenroofshad the one of the lowest costs. The cool roof had reduced maintenance and energy costs but highest long-term costs due to frequent need for roof replacements (ibid). Ultimately, they concluded that an extensive green roof would be the most cost effective option in the longterm but noted the lack of consideration towards monetizing other major benefits of green roofswithinthestudy,suchasimprovedairqualityandstormwaterrunoffreductions.Zinzi& Agnoli(2012)statethatmodelinggreenroofsimulationscanbedifficultwhenusingcalculation toolsbecauseofthenumberofdifferentvariablesconsideredaswellaslackofdatarequired. 46



While some data exists on installation costs, there is even less information collected

regarding maintenance costs and timelines (Binstock, 2011). Maintenance is complex and dependent on the type of green roof installed; generally green roofs require "constant watering, occasional fertilization, regular maintenance checks and weed removal" (Vijayaraghavan, 2016, 748). The extent and frequency of these tasks depend on the type of greenroof,plantselection,andclimate(ibid).Greenroofsystemsandcomponentsarecostlyto remove or replace, but this can be avoided if green roof system are properly designed and installed (Ngan, 2004). Peck & Kuhn (n.d.) suggest that maintenance of waterproofing membrane and plants should range from two to three yearly inspections for the removal of weedsandweeklyvisitsforirrigation,pruningandreplanting.Theyassumethatmaintenance costsrangebetween$13-$21persquaremetreforextensivegreenroofs,and$13.50-$43per square metre for intensive green roof. Sproul et. al. (2014) note that maintenance costs for green roofs average $2.9 US dollars per metre square, while maintenance for cool roofs and conventional roofs are approximately $0.2 per metre square annually over a 40 year period. Green roof maintenance costs are also said to be higher in the fist two years Sproul et. al. (2014).KatsandGlassbrook(2015)estimategreenroofmaintenancecostsat$3-$6.87dollars permetresquareforthefirstthreeyearsafterinstallation,and$2.04-$4.61meterssquarepast thethreeyearperiod.

markets in North America (Getter & Rowe, 2006). In Ontario, the building code's silence on greenroofconstructioncausedsomeCanadiancompaniestorelyontheGermanFLLguidelines fordetailsondesignguidelinesandstandardsforgreenroofs(Ngan,2004).ThisforcedtheCity ofTorontotodeveloptheirownstandardswhenitcametogreenroofs.Althoughtheprovince isconsideringsuchmeasuresnow,thiscomesafulleightyearsaftertheCityofTorontoalready invested in the creation of the Toronto Green Roof Construction Standard (TGRCS), and their supplementary guidelines.   The development of these standards was a move in the right direction, and investments to date suggest that this is improving across North America. It is unclear whether a lack of technical expertise and insufficient budgets for green roof projects still act as a barrier in the construction of poor green roof systems leading to negative perceptionsofgreenroofbenefitsandcosts.ThisalsoappliestotheLackofexpertisearound maintenance procedures identified by Peck et. al. (1999); whom stated that this lack of expertise is problematic when improper maintenance leads to roof damage. Suggested solutions to these barriers have been noted as government support for technology diffusion, whichtheCityofTorontohastriedtodisplaythroughcommittingtothegreeningofroofson 48

Lee (2017) states that such an assessment typically costs up to $3000.00. To address this barrier, the City of Toronto

7.2BARRIERSFACEDBYTORONTOSCHOOLBOARDS
 In2016,theCityofTorontoretainedLuraConsultingtoconductanextensivereviewof

the Eco-roof Incentive Program in order to determine potential changes for improvement, increase program awareness and encourage implementation throughout the City. As part of this review, the firm conducted multiple forms of stakeholder engagement including online surveys,focusgroupswithroofingprofessionalsandpastprogramparticipants,andone-to-one interviews. Although the review focused on the City's incentive program, engagement questions directly inquired about the barriers to program participation, green roof implementation and cool-roof implementation. Three major Toronto Public School boards participated in this review: the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), the Toronto DistrictSchoolBoard(TDSB)andtheTorontoFrenchCatholicSchoolBoard.(Conseilscolairede district catholique Centre-Sud). Staff from each School Board was consulted via one-on-one interviews,andsomeschoolboardrepresentativeswereconsultedthroughfocusgroupsheld for past participants (although unclear how many constituted this group). Below are synthesizedresultsofbarriersthatwereidentifiedthroughtheinterviews. 7.2.1MAINTENANCEMANAGEMENTANDCOSTS  All three school boards raised major concerns regarding the cost of on-going

Only TDSB provided an estimate of the annual cost of maintenance for their current inventory of green roofs,whichrangesfrom$1500to$2000perroof.Eachschoolboardmanagesmaintenance differently: 1.

Both school boards claim that tasks associated with maintenance fall outside the scope of unionized staff responsibilities, and requires further investments for safety training and equipment. The French Catholic board notes that this issue does not pertain to them, as

51

they do not have unionized staff.  Overall the school boards recommended the following as somepotentialsolutions: 1.

However, as mentioned previously the City of Toronto supports these additional costs through the allowance of a structural assessment grant (SAG) of up to one third of the estimated costs of a structural assessment. It is also important to note that green roofs are not required on retrofitted buildings.   52

7.2.3LACKOFAWARENESSOFGREENROOFBENEFITS SomeresponsesorconcernssharedbyTDSBmadeevidentthattherearestillknowledgegaps regarding the benefits of green roofs. As a result, school board staff recommended that a samplebusinesscasebegiventoboardstouseindecision-makingprocessesregardinggreen roofconsiderationsthatwouldprovidedetailsofcostsandbenefits.TDSBstaffnotedthatthe only real benefit associated with green roofs is habitat creation, which is not a priority considering associated costs. Staff also noted that eco-roofs provide no visible or tangible benefits. Both TDSB and TCDSB staff revealed preferences to adopt greening measures at grade, such as tree planting or greening playing fields instead of investing in roof improvements,sinceatgradeinvestmentscouldbecorrelatedwithdirectbenefitsforstudents and staff. While discussing barriers to cool roof implementation, staff noted that not many buildings are air conditioned, resulting in less need for reduced cooling costs associated with coolroofs.Furthermore,theystatedthatreductionsinambientairtemperatureswouldresult in public rather than private benefits, dissuading them from pursuing adoption of this technology.  Asexploredearlyinthispaper,greenroofsdoinfactresultinavarietyofbenefits,both

public and private. The most pressing value to property owners is the energy saving and reduction in heating and cooling costs. Even though many TDSB buildings might not be equipped with heating and cooling systems, green roofs help to naturally regulate indoor air temperatures, resulting in enhanced thermal comfort. Isaa et. al. (2011) studied different aspects of usage in a sample of conventional, energy-retrofitted and green Toronto Public Schools and compared student, teacher and staff absenteeism data, student performance 53

scores, and conducted a survey of teachers to investigate satisfaction related to air quality, lighting,thermalcomfortandacousticsofschoolbuildings.Theyfoundthatteachersingreen schools were more satisfied with indoor air quality, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and thermalcomfort(Ibid).Theyalsodiscoveredthatabsenteeismingreenschoolsimprovedby27.5%, and student performance improved by 8-19% in comparison to conventional schools (ibid). Other Studies have shown linkages between greener indoor environments or green buildings in enhancements of student learning, reductions in absenteeism, and productivity improvements (Heschong, 1999; Heschong 2003; Miller et. al., 2009; Milton, et. al. 2000).

construction of eco-roofs. The Toronto Green Roof Construction Standard Supplementary Guidelines do touch upon best practices in construction of green roofs as well as green roof components, definitions, and technical standards. Additionally, The City of Toronto's 2013 GuidelinesforBiodiverseGreenRoofsprovidesguidanceonrecommendedplantspecies,plant speciestoavoidandotherdesignormaterialfeatures(CityofToronto,2013c). 7.2.5FUNDINGCONCERNS The two largest Toronto school boards, TDSB and TCDSB also claimed that a lack of funding coupled with high operating costs in the City of Toronto (15% higher than the rest of the province) created a barrier to green roof implementation. Although TCDSB argued that the Ministry acknowledges this uplift and as a result provides additional 10 to 15 percent in funding. Nevertheless, both school boards state that the provincial funding model directly impactstheirchoicesregardinggreenroofadoption.TheystatethatwhiletheCityofToronto provides incentives for installation, these do not cover the entire costs of installation. Hence, they argue that greater financial assistance is necessary to support school boards in the procurementofgreenroofs. 7.2.6SAFETYCONCERNS Schoolboardsraisedissueswithmanagingsafetyconcernsastheyrelatetogreenroofaccess.

costs associated with roof replacements. They partnered with a solar installation company to replace 300 roofs with the conventional roof membrane at a cost of $10 per sq. ft., which translatestoapproximately$108persquaremetre.Assumingthatcostsforanextensivegreen roofrangefrom$150to$200,andtheCityofTorontoprovidesanincentiveof$100persquare metre for green roofs, TDSB would likely only be covering the same cost of installation as a conventionalroof,wheninstallinganextensivegreenroof.Additionally,theyacknowledgethat replacementsofconventional(BUR)roofsresultinharmfulandstrongodorsduetotheuseof

SECTION3:MOVINGFORWARD


 8.0INTERGOVERNMENTALCOLLABORATION
 Literature has shown that there is a need for collaborative efforts between municipal, provincial and federal levels of government for the implementation of policy framework guiding municipal action in the green economy (Federation of municipalities, 2011, 2). Evidence suggests thatlocalmunicipalitiesarethekeyentitiesthatcanmandateorencouragetheuseofgreenroofs as a means to environmental protection goals but that they are not met with adequate support fromotherlevelsofgovernment(Carter&Fowler,2008;Federationofmunicipalities,2011).This section will analyze provincial and federal policies to determine current and potential funding supportforgreenroofsatdifferentlevelsofgovernment.

8.1FEDERALPOLICIESANDFUNDINGSOURCES
In January 2016, the federal government released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate change, which creates the framework for collaboration between the provincial, territorial and federal levels to address climate change and create economic growth. This frameworkacknowledgedthatthebuiltenvironmentwasthethirdlargestsectorintheproduction ofGHGemissions,makingupapproximately12%ofallemissions(GovernmentofCanada,2016).It identifiednewactionstothebuiltenvironment,includingthedevelopmentofmodelbuildingcodes in support for more energy efficient buildings through building code changes and retrofits, as 75 percent of the building stock in 2030 will be composed of existing structures (Government of

58

Canada, 2016). The federal government also recognized the importance of investment in green infrastructurefortheCanadianeconomy: Construction in Canada is a $171 billion industry, and it employs well over a million people. New building codes will spur innovation and support Canadian businesses in developingmoreefficientbuildingtechniquesandtechnologies.Investmentsinretrofits toimproveenergyefficiencyhavebeenshowntobestrongjobcreators,providingdirect localbenefits,creatinglocaljobs,andreducingenergybills(GovernmentofCanada,2016, 15).



Theyalsostatedthatapproximately$40milliondollarswouldbededicatedtotheintegration of climate adaptation measures in building design guides and codes through updates in the national building code by 2020 (Government of Canada, 2016). Although this framework is usefulinoutlininganationalcommitmenttoclimatechangeresilienceandsettingexamplesfor provincial and territorial governments, no direct funding has been identified.  In their submission to the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change FederalProvincial-Territorial Working Group, Green Infrastructure Ontario (GIO) advocated that living green infrastructure be incorporated into policies, programs, and financial mechanisms of effortstoaddressclimatechange.(GreenInfrastructureOntario,n.d.).Thereportoutlinedfive specificrecommendations,includingimplementationoflivinginfrastructureinpolicybackedby acommitmentfromalllevelsofgovernmenttoallocateatleast15%ofinfrastructurefunding tolivinggreeninfrastructureinvestment.Theyalsorecommendedthatalife-cyclemanagement approach be applied to infrastructure projects, and identified the need for a dedicated fund. None of these recommendations were realized in the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean GrowthandClimateChangeuponrelease.

However,federalfundingforgreeninfrastructureinvestmentsisavailablethroughthe

Federationof Canadian Municipalities'(FCM) GreenMunicipal Fund (GMF) (Coutinho, 2016). The federal governments 2016 capital budget, proposed $125 million over two years to the FCM to enhance the GMF, specifically for projects that reduce GHG emissions and provide tangible community benefits through environmental, social and economic outcomes (InfrastructureCanada,2017).Sinceitsinceptionin2000,GMFhasfinancedover$700million tomunicipalgreeninfrastructureprojects(InfrastructureCanada,2017).However,thisfunding is traditionally dedicated to large singular municipal projects, such as the solar city in Halifax and does not have any portion of funding dedicated to living green infrastructure (Infrastructure Canada, 2017). Federal policies could have a larger role in environmental protectionandprovidedirectgreenrooffundingbymeansofgrantsorsubsidizationthrough taxreliefforgreenroofinstallations(Carter&Fowler,2008).

8.2PROVINCIALPOLICIESANDFUNDINGSOURCES
The province of Ontario released its Climate Change Strategy in 2016. Policies outlined in provincial documents are more relevant to the subject at hand as education is a provincial responsibility.Thisstrategyoutlinedtheneedforpublicsectorreductionsincarbonemissions, including municipalities, hospitals, schools and universities. Much like the federal climate change policy, the province identified built form as a large contributor to GHG emissions; stating that they are the third largest sector representing approximately 19%-24% of overall emissions.  The province also recognized the economic benefits that climate-related technologiessuchasgreenroofscreate;citingthat$100millioninvestedinthesetechnologies

60

generates$107millioninGDPandresultsin1400newjobs(MinistryoftheEnvironmentand ClimateChange,2016a,17).  Withinthesameyear,theprovincealsoreleasedOntario'sFive-YearClimateActionPlan

2016 ­ 2020. The action plan aims to create actions to realize the goals outlined within the Climate Change Strategy, and to create awareness, jobs and growth in the green economy. Action areas identified included: transportation, buildings and homes, land-use Planning, industryandbusiness,collaborationwithIndigenouscommunities,researchanddevelopment, government, and agriculture, forests and lands.  Specific actions in the buildings and homes sector included improving energy efficiency in schools and hospitals (Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, 2016b, 26). The province outlined intentions to provide fundingforexistingschoolstoimproveenergyefficiencyandfortheinstallationofrenewable energy technologies ­ however, green roofs were not explicitly mentioned. Another action identified in this sector included setting lower carbon standards for new buildings through updatestotheprovincialbuildingcodetargetingnewnetzerocarbonemissionsandlong-term energy efficiency. Actions within land-use planning included strengthening climate change policies by setting green development standards so that municipalities would be able to pass by-lawsinareasoutsideofnewconstruction.Additionally,theprovinceoutlinedamendingthe MunicipalActandCityofTorontoActtoenablemunicipality'sprovince-widerequirestandards ortechnologiestoreduceemissions,wheretechnicalbuildingcodestandardsexist.Finally,the plan outlines support for municipal and stakeholder climate action through fostering partnerships with organizations, private sector and institutions such as schools to find new waystolower-carbonanddeliverinitiatives. 61

Ontario plans on financing actions in its climate change plan through establishing a Green Bank and the Green Ontario Fund. All three will be receive funds from proceeds of Ontario'sCapandTradeprogramforcarbonemissions,whichwillbeheldintheGreenhouse Gas Reduction Account (GGRA). In February 2016, the provinces' Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act, (Bill 172) received Royal Assent ­ requiring all proceeds from Ontario's cap and trade program be invested back into projects that reduce greenhouse gas pollution(MinistryoftheEnvironmentandClimateChange,2016c).Thisfigureisestimatedat approximately $1.9 billion dollars annually (Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, 2016c).  The Green Bank provides information and financial support for homeowners and businesses to better access energy-efficient technologies, and supports commercial and industrialprojectsarealsooutlinedforprojectsthat"requirescaletobefinancedprivately,by working with commercial banks to help aggregate projects to reduce risk" (Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, 2016d, 17).  The Green Bank has no funds allocated to institutions. The Green Ontario Fund was established with $377 million dollars worth of Cap and trade proceeds and is a new non-for profit agency that will deliver programming and rebates for homeowners, businesses, and large industry (ibid). This arose out of the Green InvestmentFund,whichsawaninitial$325milliondollarsfromtheprovince'sdownpayment onthecapandtradeprogram(ibid).Althoughtheprovinceisdedicatingsignificantamountsof fundingfromthecapandtradeproceedsbackintoreducingGHGemissionsandeventhough they outlined reductions for public schools as essential in their strategy, none of the funds establishedareactuallyapplicableforaidingschoolboardsfundgreeninfrastructureprojects orenergyefficiencymeasuresinnewbuildsandretrofits. 62

Hence, school boards in Ontario have no direct funding sources to allocate for green infrastructureinvestmentattheprovinciallevel.However,theMinistryofEducationdoesfund capitalfundingfornewschoolaswellasadditionsandrenovations.TheMinistryofEducation (2017a)estimatesthattheprovincehasprovidedcloseto$17.5billiondollarsincapitalfunding toschoolboardsformorethan820newschoolsandmorethan800additionsandrenovations since2003;andisprojectedtoprovidecloseto$16billionoverthenext10years(Ministryof Education, 2017b). These investments not only go towards new builds and improvements in existing buildings but also towards projects to reduce surplus space, such as school consolidations (Ministry of Education, 2017b). However, Toronto school boards such as the TorontoDistrictsSchoolBoard(TDSB)andtheTorontoCatholicDistrictSchoolBoard(TCDSB) maintain that the capital funding is not enough to cover maintenance backlogs estimated at $3.5 billion for TDSB and $600 million for TCDSB (Rushowy, 2016). In 2016, the province increasedfundingforbothboards,givingTDSB$579millionandTCDSBatotalof$107million (Rushowy, 2016). However, due to the deteriorating conditions of schools, half of which are over40yearsold,thefundsarestillnotenough.Thisresultsinnofundingleftoverforboards to invest in green infrastructure and explains the hesitation and lack of ability to place funds asideforgreenroofconstructionandmaintenanceasmandatedbytheCityofToronto.

8.3POTENTIALMUNICIPALFUNDINGSOURCES
Lee(2017)recommendsthatCityofTorontoincuradditionalfinancialresponsibilityto provide several incentives, rather than depending only on the direct financial incentive with cash-in-lieu contributions. She asserts that the incorporation of green roofs as a stormwater management incentive would make for a better option and suggests that stormwater runoff 63

chargesmaybetheanswer(Lee,2017).TorontoWaterannouncedplansforastormwaterfee in2015,totakeeffectin2018andwouldraisefundstopayforcapitalprojectsthatwoulddeal withthestormwatermanagementsystem(Cross,2015).Thisfeeisprogressiveasitbasesthe feeontheamountofimpervioussurfacewithinaproperty,thuschargingthosewhocontribute to stormwater management issues more than others (Coutinho, 2016; Li, 2013). Schools are typicallylargerbuildings,withvastamountsofpavementandlargerroofspaces,meaningthat such a charge may dissuade them from forgoing green roof installations (Coutinho, 2016). Unfortunately,theCityofTorontooptednottoimplementastormwaterimpactfeeandMayor JohnTorystatedthattheideawouldbeshelveduntil2019(Rider,2017).Additionally,during theconsiderationperiodtheCitywascontemplatingwhetherschoolboardswouldbeexempt from this fee. Toronto can look to many regions that have implemented the fee, such as the District of Columbia, in the United States. The District of Columbia Department of the Environment (DDOE) collects "a stormwater impact fee on commercial and residential properties based on amount of impervious surface and puts the funds towards managing stormwater pollution in the district" (Li, 2013, 22).  The City of Washington in the District of Columbia has used this as an opportunity to further incentivize stormwater management practices by provides an additional stormwater discount fee based on area of impervious surfaceonaproperty,whenitisreduced(Li,2013,24). Alternatively, the City of Toronto also has the option of redistributing or developing further incentives from funds located in the Eco-Roof Financial Assistance Reserve Fund. The CityreportedthatasofJanuary26th,2017,therewas$2,220,177.17intheEco-RoofFinancial AssistanceReserveFund(CityofToronto,2017e).Thisamountoffundsavailableduetocash64

in-lieu contributions represents approximately 11,100 square metres of green roof not built within the City. This presents an opportunity to dedicate some portion of these funds to additionalincentivestohelpgreenroofimplementation.

9.0DISCUSSION
 The barriers that Toronto School boards face in the implementation of green roofs acrossnewandexistingpropertiesarenotminimal.Thereasonsbehindschoolboarddecisions to opt out of providing a green roof, as explored through an analysis of cash-in-lieu documentationandinterviewresultswiththreeprominentschoolboards,suggeststhatthere is much to be done. While the City of Toronto took steps to reduce these barriers ­ through taking early steps to identify them in the policy development process, expanding eco-roof program funding to schools, and developing a structural adjustment grant-- municipal measuresalonehaveproventobeinsufficientineasingschoolboardconcerns. ItisclearthatmoresupportisneededfromtheProvincialandFederalGovernments. It hasbeen12yearssincetheCityofTorontoinitiatedsupportforgreenroofsthroughtheGreen roofstrategyand8yearssincetheyestablishedregulationandstandardstoencouragegreen roof construction.

School boards have been asking the province for more support regarding green roof implementation since inception of the by-law, twice with the support of the City of Toronto through Council recommendations. In fact in 2016, the City of Toronto City-School Boards Advisory Committee and City Council, recommended that the Government of Ontario align capitalandoperatingbudgetallowanceswiththeirownOntarioClimateChangeStrategyand ActionPlan,inordertosupportschoolboardsinmeetingrequirementsundertheGreenRoof By-law and under the Toronto Green Standard (Toronto City-School Boards Advisory Committee,2016).Onaprovinciallevel,itisclearthatclimatechangepolicieshaveidentifieda need and goal for funding to be allocated to schools in order to increase energy efficiency, reduce GHG emissions and to achieve other benefits. However, current funding through the GreenBankandtheGreenOntarioFunddoesnotallocateanyprovisionsforschoolstoreceive additionalfunding. Schoolboardshavearighttodemandmorefromtheprovince,astheyaretheauthority dealing with a mass inventory of aging infrastructure and a growing list of maintenance backlogs. The province needs to be mindful of the fact that not taking steps to help school boards means that public funds are being directed towards private benefits, as the funds are thenusedtosupportotherprivateprojectsthroughtheEco-RoofIncentiveprogram.Toronto SchoolBoardsalsoneedtorecognizethatinvestingintheirpropertiesthroughtraditionalgrey infrastructure, such as roof replacements with conventional systems, only perpetuates the cycleofissuesthattheyface.

thatsaid,theFederalgovernmentneedstomorespecificallyacknowledgethebenefitsofliving green infrastructure and bring awareness to its benefits. It is unclear what support future building codes will have for green roofs but funding support through grants or subsidization throughtaxreliefforgreenroofinstallationsisanoption. The City also needs to focus on addressing concerns communicated by school boards. TheCity'ssuccesswithgreenroofimplementationonschoolsisstillhinderedbymanyofthe initialbarriersidentifiedthroughpolicydevelopment.Asshownthroughquantitativeanalysis, almosthalfofschoolsiteplanshavebeencapturedbythegreenroofby-law(fromJan2010to Oct2017),andapproximatelyhalfallschoolscaughtbytheby-lawchosetoprovidecash-in-lieu ofagreenroof.Thisnecessitatesactiononthepartofthemunicipalitytostriveforcontinuous evaluation and improvement to address concerns. In fact, school boards have identified particular measures that may alleviate pressures through the Eco-roof Incentive Program Review. These suggestions attempted to breakdown obstacles to funding concerns, maintenance management and costs, reduce uncertainty and lack of awareness, reduce administrative barriers and improve access to information regarding green roofs to enable enhanceddecisionmakingprocesses.Whilesomerecommendationsmaybeoutsidethescope oftheCity'sinfluence,manycanbedirectlyaddressed.  With respect to maintenance, it is clear that more information is needed for school

Theyalsohavelittleinformationonwhatagreenroofshouldcostandwhatistypicaltoaskof green roof companies in terms of maintenance agreements. This uncertainty feeds the perception that school boards may not always be getting the best deal when seeking out qualified contractors.

While some installation companies provide clients with this resource,notallcompaniesdo.Itwouldbewisetohaveastandardmaintenanceplanchecklist forschoolscateredtoeachtypeofgreenroof.  With respect to addressing the issue of structural capacity, school boards need to be

more informed on the options existent for retrofits. For example, the NYC Department of Education Office of Sustainability, School Construction Authority, and Department of Environmental Protection Office of Green Infrastructure came together to create such a resource for New York City schools. They authored and released A Guide to Green Roofs on ExistingSchoolBuildings,relayinginformationon:thetypesofgreenroofsavailable,benefitsof green roofs, educational opportunities, planning requirements and considerations including 69

upfrontcoststoexpect,whattolookforinexistingroofconditions,structuralloadingcapacity, on going maintenance costs to expect, and requirements to meet (NYC Department of Education Office of Sustainability et. al., n.d.).  Such a guide addressed issues of uncertainty with requirements while also providing much needed information to school boards regarding decisionstoinstallagreenroof.Thisguidecouldalsoincorporatecasestudiesspecifictoschool buildings or properties that displays the range of options for design, materials and more.

2. It is recommended that the City of Toronto form partnerships with Toronto Public SchoolBoards,pre-approvingpublicschoolsfortheEco-roofIncentiveprograminorder todecreaseadministrativeburdensassociatedwiththeapplication. 3. Should funds exist, the City should create a direct incentive to cover a portion of maintenance costs for schools and non-for-profits. The City should be aware that maintenance is usually covered under warrantee for the first two to three years after installation,andnoprecedentexampleshavebeenfoundtoincludecoverthecostsof maintenance. 4. ItisrecommendedthattheCityofTorontoadoptastormwaterfeeorstormwatertax. Thelattercouldprovidetaxbreaksforthosewhotakemeasurestoreducetheamount ofstormwaterrunoffwithintheirproperties. 5. It is recommended that the City of Toronto host regular information sessions with property owners (including school boards) to provide more information on standards, requirements, and regulation. This is also a good opportunity for the City hear and understand concerns related to such regulation, in order to inform future improvements.

10.4TORONTOPUBLICSCHOOLBOARDS

11.0CONCLUSION
 The public and private benefits that green roofs can provide have been well documented. Green roofs provide immense environmental advantages that result in positive public health outcomes, and represent an important component of broader green infrastructure measures to combat the impacts of climate change.  They also create social gathering spaces, increase access to green space within urban areas and offer an important educational opportunity to inform younger generations of the importance of environmental sustainability.Thesebenefitshavenotgoneunnoticedbythefederal,provincial,andmunicipal governments. While the federal government is making steps to become a leader in climate changeresilienceandadaptation,theyarenotthebestpositionedfordeliveringontheground changes. When it comes to Toronto School boards, it can be determined that the larger responsibilityrestsontheshouldersoftheprovincialandmunicipalgovernments.Inthewake of barriers such as uncertainty, lack of awareness and large maintenance backlogs, Toronto PublicSchoolsneedmoresupportandguidanceinordertomakesecureinvestmentsforgreen roof incorporation across their properties. This study attempted to identify the barriers associated with green roof implementation across Toronto Public Schools in order to suggest optionsmovingforwardtoovercomesuchbarriers.Thiswasdonetoalsoinformtheadoption of green roof legislation and incentives in other Ontario municipalities, as the province considersexpandingtheirabilityimplementsuchregulation.However,itshouldbenotedthat schools operating in the City of Toronto generally face more funding constraints due to high operation costs. Nevertheless, the barriers they face shed light on the potential barriers that

75

schools in other regions could struggle with, should legislation be enforced. Regardless, improvementsmadeinToronto'scasecanactasamodelforothermunicipalities,suchasthe need for continuous information sessions and access to resources for green roof implementation.
