TECHNOLOGY READINESS, ATTITUDE TOWARDS COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER LITERACY AMONG FIRST YEAR NURSING STUDENTS: A CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE

Master of Nursing 2008 Rita Wilson Master of Nursing Program Ryerson University

Abstract This descriptive correlational study used a convenience sample (n=30) recruited from one Canadian School of Nursing to investigate first year nursing students' preparedness for technology use. It examined the students' general technology readiness, attitudes toward computer use in general and in nursing as well as their general computer literacy. Most students were average "techno-ready", had positive attitudes toward computer use in general and in nursing and had low self-perceived proficiency in various computer applications. There was beginning evidence in support of statistically significant positive relationships among the students' technology readiness, their attitude towards computers and their computer literacy. The findings did not support correlations between the students' attitude towards computers and their computer literacy or between their technology readiness and their computer literacy. These findings suggest that some first year nursing students may need additional supports to enhance their preparedness to work in today' s technology-rich health care environment.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Introduction to the Problem
Contemporary health care facilities are becoming increasingly dependent on information and communication technology (ICT) including electronic documentation, barcode scanners, point-of-caretechnology and decision support systems (Bosma, Balen, Davidson & Jewesson, 2003; Catz, Bernardo, Phillips & Podolak, 2002; Walker, 2006). According to Beynon-Davies (2004) ICT refers to "any technology used to support information gathering, processing, distribution and use" (pp. 7-8). To adequately prepare nursing students to work in this technology-rich environment, some Schools ofNursing (SONs) are developing innovative strategies to provide hands-on experience with various types ofiCT (Birz, 2005; Connors, Weaver, Warren & Miller, 2002; Goldsworthy, Lawrence, & Goodman, 2006; Vogel & Muirhead, 2007). In addition, students are being encouraged to develop ICT competency through course work that requires them to: 1) communicate electronically, 2) reference electronic databases, 3) access electronic textbooks, and 4) use various computer applicatio.rls including presentation graphics software, word processors, and the Internet (McDowell & Ma, 2007). ,Few would deny that there is a need for contemporary nursing students to become proficient in the use of ICT. Yet, the nursing literature suggests that some younger nursing students (i.e. =::: 21 years) may lack confidence in their ability to learn to use ICT (Maag, 2006). Many Canadian first year nursing students are=::: 21 years (College of Nurses of Ontario [CNO], 2006). Therefore, Maag's findings imply that some Canadian first year nursing students may perceive themselves as ill-prepared to work in increasingly complex health care environments equipped with both sophisticated technology and various types of computers including hand-held 1 .

and mobile devices. However, few studies have examined first year nursing students' abilities to use ICT, particularly in a Canadian context. A review of the empirical evidence generated by nursing and other disciplines suggested that a number of factors might be important in understanding nursing students' preparedness for ICT use. These factors included their: 1) general beliefs & attitudes about technology (Parasuraman & Colby, 2001 ); 2) attitudes toward computer use in general and in nursing (Davis, 1989; Loyd & Gressard; Jayasuriya, & Caputi, 1996; 1984; Maag, 2006; McBride & Nagle, 1996; Schwirian, Malone, Stone, Nunley & Francisco, 1989); 3) self-perceived proficiency in computer use, generally speaking (Levine & Donitsa-Schmidt, 1998; McDowell & Ma, 2007); and, 4) individual characteristics including age and education (Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005; Ramayah, Jantan, Roslin & Siron, 2003). Thus, exploring these factors is an important first step in understanding preparedness for ICT, which may ultimately support efforts to prepare first year nursing students for ICT use in these complex health care environments. Parasuraman and Colby (200 1) used the term technology readiness to describe the beliefs (cognitive responses) and the resultant mindset (affective response) that underpin an individual's propensity to accept and use technology. Liaw (2001) defined attitude as "the way an individual feels about and is disposed towards certain objects" (p. 138). Therefore, attitude towards computers could be described as positive or negative feelings that shape a person's behaviour towards the technology. Finally, Levine and Donitsa-Schmidt (1998) purported that computer literacy, described in terms of computer use and proficiency, is related to an individual's perceptions about computers. Although the empirical evidence derived from other disciplines suggests that these factors may be important to understanding students' preparedness for technology use, few studies have

2

explored possible relationships among these variables, in a nursing context. As well, only one study was found that investigated the correlation between nursing students' attitude toward technology use in general and their attitude towards the use of computers in nursing (Schwirian et al., 1989). That study, which was conducted almost two decades ago, found a positive correlation between general attitude towards technology and attitude towards computer use in nursing. This finding implies that people with a positive attitude towards technology use in general might also have a positive attitude towards computer use in nursing and vice versa. Davis (1989) purported that there is a correlation between perceived ease of compute~ use and attitude toward computers. This assumption implies that first year nursing students' perceived ease of computer use in general might be related to their overall attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing. Loyd and Gressard (1984) perceived that a positive attitude towards general computer use might result in increased confidence in ICT use whereas a negative attitude might engender technology-induced anxiety. Therefore, first year nursing students with a positive attitude towards general computer use might have a greater level of computer confidence when compared to their peers with a negative attitude towards general computer use. Finally, Levine and Donitsa-Schmidt (1998) envisioned a correlation between people's attitudes toward general computer use and their computer literacy, described in terms of use and proficiency. Thus, hypothetically speaking, there might be a relationship between first year nursing students' attitude towards general computer use and their computer literacy. For that reason, this potential relationship warrants further investigation. Given the increased use of computers and more sophisticated technology in contemporary health care environments, the goal of this study was to examine Canadian first year nursing students' general technology readiness, attitudes towards computer use in general and in nursing

3

and their perceived general computer literacy. Given the paucity of nursing research on this topic, the study drew upon previous work completed in nursing as well as other disciplines.

Background of the Study
Despite the ubiquity of technology and computers in the 21 st century, for some, the notion ofiCT use is anxiety provoking (Jacobson, Holder & Deamer, 1989; Jayasuriya, & Caputi, 1996; Negron, 1995; Wilson, 1991). Davis (1986) theorized that such affective or emotional responses to technology use (specifically computer use) correlates with a person's behavioural responseacceptance or avoidance. The literature provides ample empirical evidence to support this assertion. For example, previous studies suggest that there is a correlation between students' technology readiness (which is comprised ofboth cognitive and affective dimensions) and their use of computerized technology (Hendry, 2000; Van der Rhee, Verma, Plaschka & Kickul, 2007). Hendry (2000) examined a sample of undergraduate students enrolled in a Business degree program. The author found that students with a positive view of technology were more inclined to take courses requiring ICT use than students with a negative perception of the technology. Hendry's study thus provides some empirical support for the hypothesis articulated by Schwirian et al. (1989) that some students who have an aversion to computer use might have intentionally avoided ICT -related courses in high school; thus, they may not be prepared for ICT use when they enter university. Schwirian et al. conducted a large study in the United States (U. S.) (n=353) that investigated three successive cohorts of sophomore nursing students. The study's purpose was to examine the students' affective responses to ICT use in clinical settings and to explore the factors that were associated with those responses. The researchers found that almost 50 percent of the participants had had no prior experience with computer-based teaching-learning
4

strategies. Therefore, they cautioned that nurse educators in baccalaureate degree programs might be overestimating the extent of computer experience incoming nursing students obtain in high school. They also recommended that nursing faculty assess incoming students' computer literacy prior to integrating ICT within the nursing curricula. Thomas, Delaney, and Weiler (1992) made similar recommendations a few years later, once again accentuating the importance of studying first year nursing students-the population of interest in this study. Thomas and colleagues (1992) examined the relationship between students' affective responses to general computer use and their computer literacy in a mixed sample comprised of 48 basic and post-diploma baccalaureate degree nursing students. The researchers reported that the post-diploma students were more computer literate than the younger generic-BSN students and had more positive affective responses as well. The authors concluded that the research findings challenged the common assumption that younger nursing students are more knowledgeable of computers than their older peers. Thus, the authors accentuated the need for first year nursing students' computer literacy "to be assessed, not assumed" (p. 169). Eleven years after the first recommendations were published, Elfrink et al. (2000) reiterated Schwirian et al.'s (1989) concerns based on the results of their own study. Elfrink et al. investigated 44 nursing students from five SONs in the U.S. and reported that only 59% of the participants had taken formal ICT-related courses and only 32% had previously used some type ofiCT (specifically to access electronic mail [e-mail] or computerized records). More recently, Maag (2006) made a similar plea to nurse educators (to evaluate first year nursing students' preparedness for ICT use) after reviewing the results of her national study of nursing students' general attitude towards technology. The sample (n=743), which was drawn from 28 SONs across the U.S, included both undergraduate and graduate nursing students. Her

5

concluding comments, which are repeated verbatim below, suggest that the issue of low technology readiness among first year nursing students continues to be problematic and may be more prevalent that previously realized:

Contrary to the common belief, the younger student participants displayed ... lower confidence in their ability to learn about technology, and a lower mean score in "liking to
~

use technology". These data refute the assumption that younger students ( < = 21 years old) who have been exposed to technology throughout primary and secondary school have more positive views and confidence in learning about technology. Some educators assume younger students enjoy using technology; however, the data garnered from this study refute this idea " (p. 117).
In light of the increased emphasis on ICT use in many contemporary Canadian health care

facilities, the findings reported in the aforementioned studies are important to the present research for several reasons. First, many Canadian first year nursing students are 21 years or younger. Therefore, this demographic profile increases the likelihood that some first year nursing students might rate themselves as having low technology readiness. Second, faculty in Canadian SONs may have similar assumptions about first year nursing students as those described in the literature. Finally, but equally important, is the fact that the four preceding studies involved samples drawn from SONs in the U.S. Viewed collectively, the results of these four studies give rise to a number of thought-provoking questions: 1) Are Canadian first year nursing students technologically ready? 2) Is there a difference in Canadian first year nursing students' technology readiness based on their age or level of education? 3) What is the attitude of Canadian first year nursing students towards computers? 4) What is the level of computer literacy among a cohort of Canadian first year nursing students?

6

Significance of the Problem
Few nursing programs in Canada integrate computer courses or technology use in the curricula to enhance students' preparedness for ICT use (Nagle & Clarke, 2004). This trend may reflect an assumption among Canadian SONs that students enter the nursing program with a propensity to embrace and use ICT. The extant literature provides no empirical evidence to support this hypothesis, particularly in a Canadian context. Rather, the literature suggests that even in today's technology-rich society some nursing students may not be adequately prepared to use computers and/or various ICT-enabled devices. Loyd and Gressard's (1984) comments, although expressed more than two decades ago, aptly describe the significance of this problem: "positive attitudes increase the prospect for achievement in any academic endeavor, and negative attitudes make achievement of competency less likely" (p. 68). Even though these authors focused solely on the relationship between attitude towards computers and academic success, a similar argument could be made for the other variables applicable to this study-technology readiness and computer literacy. Given the empirical evidence derived from both nursing and other disciplines suggesting that these factors may be important to .understanding students' preparedness for technology use, these dimensions may be important among first year nursing students as well.

Statement of the Problem
The current technological revolution in the health care industry brings with it demands and expectations for nursing students to be prepared to work in increasingly complex health care environments equipped with both sophisticated technology and various types of mobile computing devices (e.g. personal digital assistants). Yet, there is limited recent, Canadian literature exploring preparedness for ICT use among nursing students. In particular, there is a

7

paucity of empirical data concerning the general technology readiness, attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing and general computer literacy among first year nursing students, meaning those enrolled in the first year of a 4-year generic baccalaureate degree program.

Purpose of the Study
In view of the above, this study's purpose is to better understand first year nursing students' preparedness for ICT use within a Canadian context by: 1) examining their technology readiness (i.e. beliefs about and attitudes towards technology in general), 2) exploring their attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing, 3) investigating their perceived computer literacy in terms of general use and proficiency, 4) exploring the relationships that exist between the students' technology readiness and selected correlates-age, and level of education, and 5) examining the associations that exist among technology readiness, attitude towards computers and computer literacy.

Significance of the Study
This study is important to nursing for many reasons. First, it will begin to address the gaps identified in the existing Fterature-gaps that are significant because the studies that have been conducted in the U.S. may not be generalizable to first year nursing students in Canada. This limited generalizability stems from the different admission criteria for enrolment in SONs in each country. A baccalaureate degree in nursing is the entry-to-practice criterion established for the majority of nurses in Canada. This is not the same for entry-level nurses in the U.S. Therefore, a sample of first year nursing students drawn from an American SON and a sample recruited from a Canadian SON might not be comparable. Second, given the current nursing shortage, the retention of nursing students is considered a priority for nurse educators (Jeffreys, 2007). Thus, it is important to identify at-risk students such as those whose academic success

8

might be impeded by their low technology readiness, negative attitude towards computers, and/or limited computer literacy. Third, the study findings may be beneficial to nurse educators who are planning to incorporate nursing informatics (the utilization of nursing science, information science and computer technology to effectively manage nursing information) and/or the use of electronic textbooks within their curricula. Finally, although the findings may be most applicable to nursing education, the results may accentuate the need for further research to explore, explain or predict technology readiness, attitude towards computers and/or computer literacy among different types of nursing students and/or among nurses in diverse practice settings. From this perspective, this study may also be applicable to nursing practice, research and administration.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction
The primary objective of this chapter is to analyze and synthesize selective theoretical and empirical literature pertaining to the study's main concepts. These concepts were deemed relevant in the context of this study on the basis of previous studies, which suggested that they might be important to understanding nursing students' preparedness for ICT use. To achieve its intended purpose, the chapter begins with a description of the search strategy that was employed. Then, it explores the theoretical literature to explicate the rationale for the study variables and provide conceptual clarity. The empirical work underpinning this study is then examined. The chapter concludes with a summary of the literature review.

Literature Search Strategies
Given the overall aim of this study to explore preparedness for ICT use in both general and nursing-specific contexts, a variety of search terms were identified in order to retrieve relevant theoretical and empirical literature. These terms were: "information and communication technology" "ICT" "attitude towards technology", "attitude towards computers", "technology readiness", "technology acceptance", "computer literacy", "computer anxiety", "computer use", "computer confidence" and "student". Using these terms, electronic searches were performed on both nursing and non-nursing databases, specifically: CINAHL, Proquest Nursing, Joumals@OVID, Scholarsportal.Info and Google Scholar. All titles and abstracts retrieved were reviewed for relevance as evidenced by their congruence with the overall aim of this study. Those not deemed relevant were discarded. No studies were found that examined technology readiness in a nursing context. However, this phenomenon was explored in the context of

10

consumer research. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, relevant literature from consumer research was included in the literature reviewed in this chapter.

Review of Theoretical Literature
A review of the theoretical literature in both nursing and other disciplines suggested that a number of concepts might enhance one's understanding of preparedness for ICT use. These concepts included: technology readiness (Parasuraman & Colby, 2001); attitude towards computers use in general (Loyd & Gressard, 1984) and in nursing (Jayasuriya, & Caputi, 1996; McBride & Nagle, 1996; Schwirian et al., 1989); computer literacy (Levine & Donitsa-Schmidt, 1998; McDowell & Ma, 2007); and perceived ease of computer use (Davis, 1989). Thus, this section reviews the theoretical literature related to each of these concepts.

Technology Readiness
Conceptually, technology readiness is associated with technology use in general. Technology is an umbrella term that refers to artifacts (man-made tools, weapons or objects) that are used to enhance human beings' natural abilities (Cluster, 1995). Technology readiness is also conceptually linked to Mick and Fournier's (1998) definition of technology paradoxes, which suggests that people can simultaneously have positive and negative feelings toward technology. In accordance with Mick and Fournier's perspective, Parasuraman (2000) described technology readiness as an eclectic blend of positive and negative technology-related beliefs and feelings-fears, hopes and frustrations-that co-exist and collectively shape a person's penchant for embracing and using new technology in general. As shown in Figure 1, Parasuraman and Colby (200 1) assumed that the relative dominance of an individual's technology- related beliefs exist on a continuum that drives him or her towards either resisting or embracing technology use and simultaneously reflects his or her state of technology readiness. 11

Receptive to technology

Parasuraman and Colby (200 1) delineated four distinct categories of technology beliefs, which constitute different dimensions of technology readiness. These dimensions, which are shown in Figure 2, are considered to be independent entities. However, Parasuraman and Colby assumed that the combined effect influences an individual's overall state of technology

readiness. The authors labelled two of the four technology readiness dimensions (optimism and innovativeness) contributors because of their perceived augmenting effect on an individual's state of technology readiness. Parasuraman and Colby named the other two dimensions (discomfort and insecurity) inhibitors because of their assumed suppressive influence on a person's technology readiness. Parasuraman and Colby (2001) defined optimism as "a positive view of technology and a belief that it offers people increased control, flexibility, and efficiency in their lives" (p. 34). They defined innovativeness, as "a tendency to be a technology pioneer and thought leader" (p. 3 8); and, discomfort was described as "a perceived lack of control over technology and a feeling of being overwhelmed by it" (p. 41 ). Finally, Parasuraman and Colby defined insecurity as "distrust of technology and scepticism about its ability to work properly" (p. 43). -Within the context of the present study, this perspective suggests that students with a high degree of optimism might envision ICT use as beneficial. Students classified as innovative might be very receptive to trying new and diverse types of ICT such as personal digital assistants. In contrast, students with a high level of discomfort might be easily overwhelmed by the increased emphasis on the use of ICT and those categorized as insecure might be sceptical of the benefits to be derived from the use ofiCT. From Parasuraman and Colby's (200 1) viewpoint, the relative independence of the four elements of technology readiness (optimism, innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity) implied that individuals might have varying degrees of each. Therefore, the authors perceived that this variability allows an individual to have concurrent positive and negative beliefs about technology, in general. In the context of this study, this assumption means that students with a high level of optimism about using ICT for e-mail as a personal communication tool, for

13

example, may simultaneously experience a high degree of discomfort when expected to learn to use ICT for other activities such as electronic documentation. In addition, students' technology readiness may be associated with their assessment of perceived ease of use. According to Davis (1989), perceived ease of use is the extent to which a person believes that using a particular type of technology will be relatively simple. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, an increased understanding of first year nursing students' perceived ease ofiCT use might be beneficial.

Age and Education
Oblinger and Oblinger (2005) asserted that an age dichotomy delineates different levels of comfort and experience with ICT use. According to Prensky (2005), younger students (i.e. born between 1982 and 1993) may be described as 'digital natives' or the Net Generation because they were the first generation to grow up surrounded by ubiquitous technology use-the Internet, cellular phones, digital cameras, laptops etc. In contrast, older students (i.e. born before 1982) would fit Prensky's conceptualization of 'digital immigrants'-those considered to be less experienced with the technology. In addition, Ramayah, Jantan, Roslin and Siron (2003) purported that an education dichotomy might distinguish people's technology readiness. According to these authors, more educated people have greater exposure to technology use than those with less education. Therefore, these individual characteristics may be important to consider when exploring students' technology readiness. Statistics Canada recently published age profiles of university students enrolled in health education programs (Allen, Ceolin, Ouellette, Plante, & Vaillancourt, 2007). This report suggests that the age range of first year nursing students would be consistent with the technology-related age dichotomy that is presumed to represent different levels of comfort with

14

and experience in using technology (Allen et al., 2007; Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005). Thus, to fully appreciate this difference it would be important to understand their beliefs about and attitude towards technology in general (i.e. their technology readiness) and to explore age related differences. The data provided by Statistics Canada also indicated that some nursing students would have completed various types of postsecondary education at the time of admission given their age. Thus, given the presumed technology-related education dichotomy, this trend also suggests that some first year nursing students' technology readiness might differ due to greater exposure to computers and technology. In summary, technology readiness has been conceptualized as a multidimensional construct. Rooted in Mick and Fournier's (1998) technology paradoxes, technology readiness is envisioned as an amalgam of coexisting positive and negative beliefs about technology. These technology beliefs are situated on a continuum framed by resistance on one end and receptivity on the other. The dominant technology belief determines an individual's technology readiness, which may also be associated with individual characteristics such as age and education. Technology readiness encompasses beliefs and attitudes about technology in general. Therefore, this concept may be related to beliefs about and attitudes towards computers, a specific form of technology. Attitude Towards Computers The theoretical literature describes attitude towards computers as multi-dimensional in nature. Two of these dimensions attitude towards computer use in general and attitude towards computer use in nursing were considered important to the overall understanding of nursing

15

students' preparedness for ICT use. Therefore, the literature pertaining to each of these dimensions was reviewed for this study.

Attitude Towards Computers in General
Davis (1993) defined attitude towards an object as the "affective evaluation" (p. 476) of the object in question, for example the computer. Raub (1981) defined computers as "electronic machines with the
capaci~y

to store and manipulate large amounts of alpha-numeric information"

(p. 8). The author also distinguished the computer from other types of technology based on: 1) the machine's capacity to process large volumes, and a greater variety, of information; and 2) its artificial intelligence (i.e. it can be pre-programmed to 'act' in a certain way if specific criteria are met). A simple example of this is the calendar feature inherent in some computer applications that allows the users to pre-program the computer to issue reminders about upcoming events or business meetings. Raub purported that there are many misconceptions about computers, fuelled in part by science fiction, among the general population; one of which is the perception that computers are complex 'superhuman' machines that are incomprehensible and anxiety provoking. According to Raub, this perception shapes peoples' attitudes toward computers. Attitude towards computers is described, in accordance with Davis' conceptualization, as a person's affective evaluation of computer use. Loyd and Gressard (1984) believed that a positive attitude towards computers would be expressed as computer cpnfidence but a negative attitude towards computers would be manifested as computer anxiety. These authors defined computer confidence as one's perceived "ability to use or learn about computers" (p. 502). Conversely, Loyd and Gressard (1984) described computer anxiety as the "fear of computers" (p.

16

502). Jayasuriya & Caputi (1996) described nurses' fear of computers, in general, as a contributing factor to their attitude towards computer use in nursing.

Attitude Towards Computer Use in Nursing
Stronge and Brodt (1985) described attitude towards computer use in nursing as the affective evaluation of employing computerized technology for patient care responsibilities previously performed manually. The authors purported that negative attitudes toward computer use in nursing might be manifested as avoidance of the technology. Conversely, they asserted that positive attitudes toward computer use in nursing might be seen as adoption of the technology. There is a lack of consensus regarding dimensions of attitude towards computer use in nursing. However, it is generally defined multi-dimensionally. Stronge and Brodt (1985) identified five dimensions of attitude towards computer use in nursing: 1) job security, 2) legal ramifications, 3) quality of patient care, 4) employee willingness to use computers, 5) capabilities of computers and 6) benefit to the institution. Burkes (1991) envisioned attitude towards computer use in nursing as comprised of satisfaction, beliefs, motivation and individual characteristics. Schwirian et al. (1989) described three dimensions of attitude towards computer use in nursing, namely: 1) computers and patient care, 2) computers and patient security, and 3) general attitude. Finally, according to Jayasuriya and Capati (1996), attitude towards computer use in nursing was comprised of computer anxiety, patient confidentiality and computers and patient care. For the purposes of this study, Jayasuriya and Capati's conceptualization of attitude towards computer use in nursing was adopted. Stronge and Brodt (1985) theorized that if a person's attitude towards an object is known, one could explain and predict the person's behavioural response to that object. From that 17

perspective, Jayasuriya and Caputi (1996) asserted that a person's attitude towards computers would be important in understanding his or her behavioural response to computers as well. Applied to the context of this study, Stronge and Brodt's theoretical perspective suggests that there might be a correlation between nursing students' attitude towards technology use in general and their behavioural response to a specific type of technology-the computer.

Computer Literacy
Many conceptual definitions of computer literacy were found in the literature, all of which emphasized general computer use and proficiency in various computer applications. Watt (1980) defined computer literacy as a "collection of skills, knowledge, understanding, values and relationships that allow a person to function comfortably as a productive citizen in a computeroriented society" (p. 3). Years later, Seddon (1987) purported that computer literacy was "being able to use a computer effectively and efficiently when the need arises" (p. 271). Simonson, Mauere, Montag-Toradi (1987) conceptualized computer literacy as "an understanding of computer characteristics, capabilities, and applications, as well as an ability to implement this knowledge in the skillful, productive use of computer applications suitable to individual roles in society" (p. 233). Van Vliet, Kletke and Chakraborty (1994)'s definition is somewhat more comprehensive. Van Vliet et al. defined computer literacy as "the ability to use microcomputers confidently for obtaining needed information, solving specific problems and performing dataprocessing tasks. This includes a fundamental understanding of the operation of microcomputers in general, as well as the use of several types of application software packages" (p. 83 8). The multiplicity of definitions demonstrated a lack of consensus related to the conceptualization of computer literacy. Nonetheless, each conceptualization encompassed general computer use and proficiency in various computer applications as key dimensions of 18

computer literacy. However, the nursing literature is replete with various lists of requisite computer skills (Birx et al., 1996; Gassert & McDowell, 1995; Hobbs, 2002; McDowell & Ma, 2007; Thomas et al., 1992). In an effort to standardize the computer expertise required of nurses, the American Nurses' Association (ANA) articulated that first year nursing students require ·knowledge of basic computer technology including word processing, databases and spreadsheets (ANA, 2001 ). The document also indicated that first year nursing students should be able to use relevant computer applications to communicate via e-mail and give/document patient care. The position taken by the Canadian Nurses' Association on this issue does not currently include a comparable delineation of specific skills. For these reasons, in this study, computer literacy focuses primarily on the students' self-reported skill in using various computer applications including those outlined in the ANA document.

Summary of Theoretical Literature
To summarize, conceptually, technology readiness refers to the beliefs (cognitive response) and attitudes (affective response) that underpin students' propensity to embrace and adopt technology in general. The literature also suggested that technology readiness might be associated with both perceived ease of use and attitude towards computers. Attitude towards a particular form of technology such as the computer was considered multi-dimensional. In the present study, this concept encompassed first year nursing students' attitudes towards computer use in general and in nursing. Finally, many definitions of computer literacy were found in the literature. However, each conceptualization envisioned general computer use and proficiency in various computer applications as key dimensions of computer literacy. Therefore, it was deemed important to consider first year nursing students' general use and proficiency in various computer applications in order to help understand their preparedness for ICT use. Finally, the

19

theoretical literature also suggested that individual characteristics like age and education might be important to consider when exploring students' technology readiness.

Review of Empirical Literature
The empirical literature reviewed in this section summarizes research studies that are applicable to the main concepts in this study- general technology readiness, attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing and general computer literacy. The overall aim of this section is to provide a rationale for this study. As previously discussed, no studies were found that specifically examined technology readiness in a nursing context. Two studies were found that examined nursing students' general attitude towards technology. Several studies were found that examined nursing students' attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing; however very few specifically targeted the population of interest. A small number of studies examined first year nursing students' computer literacy. Therefore, given the paucity of nursing research on the topic involving the population of interest, the study drew upon previous work completed in both nursing and consumer research and included students enrolled in different types of nursing programs (i.e. diploma, baccalaureate and graduate programs) as well as students that were in different years of their programs.

Technology Readiness
Consumer researchers have generated much of the existing scientific knowledge related to technology readiness. Investigators have examined technology readiness among the general population (Matthing, Kristensson, Gustafsson & Parasuraman, 2006; Parasuraman & Colby, 2001) and among diverse consumer groups (Chang & Karman, 2006; Hendry, 2000; Lai, 2008; Liljander, Gillberg, Gummerus & van Riel, 2005; Massey, Khatri & Ramesh, 2005; Roper, 2006; van der Rhee et al., 2007; Walczuch, Lemmink, & Streukens, 2007; Yousafzai, Pallister, &

20

Foxall, 2003). In most of these studies the aim has been to investigate the role of technology readiness in consumer behaviour relative to the use of various types ofiCT related products and services including eLearning (Hendry, 2000; Roper, 2006; van der Rhee et al., 2007); wireless technology (Chang & Karman, 2006; Massey et al., 2005); and, Internet-based self service technologies such as airline check-in (Liljander et al., 2005) and online banking (Yousafzai et al., 2003). The results of these studies provided evidence, which suggested that technology readiness might be related to: 1) attitude towards computers, 2) perceived ease of use, and 3) general technology use (Chang & Karman, 2006; Liljander et al., 2005; Matthing et al., 2006; Walczuch, Lemmink & Streukens, 2007). For example, Liljander et al. examined a sample of 1258 airline customers and reported that technology readiness was positively and significantly (p < 0.01) related to their attitude towards using the Internet (r=0.51), a kiosk (r=0.29) or mobile options (r=0.34) for airline check-in. The authors also reported a statistically significant difference (p<.01) in technology readiness based on their use of the self-service technology for airline check-in. Those who used the self-service option demonstrated greater technology readiness when compared to those who did not. Matthing et al. (2006) reported similar findings from their study, which investigated 1004 adults 2: 18 years who were randomly selected from the general population in Sweden. Those ·researchers reported a statistically significant and positive relationship between technology readiness and the participants' use of a variety of technology-based services including automated banking machines and mobile phones. The findings from that study were consistent with the results reported by Chang and Karman (2006) who examined 204 employees from various government agencies in the U.S. including the army, navy, air force and Department of Defense.

21

The participants were 35-54 years old and over 60% were males. The study findings included a statistically significant and positive relationship (r=0.46) between the participants' technology readiness and their use of wireless technology (a specific type of technology). In addition, these researchers found that general technology readiness was associated with both attitude towards wireless technology and perceived ease of use. Thus, these findings suggest that the perception of relative ease of use may be associated with greater technology readiness. W alczuch et al. (2007) investigated the correlation between general technology readiness and perceived ease of using a specific type of technology-the computer. The sample was comprised of people (n=81 0) employed in a multi-site financial institution. The researcher reported a statistically significant relationship between technology readiness and perceived ease of use. Collectively, these findings provided empirical evidence suggesting that general technology readiness may be associated with: 1) attitude towards and perceived ease of using various types of technology including computers, and 2) the use of various technology-enabled services and products. Thus, in the context of this study, these findings also suggest that students' general technology readiness might be related to their: 1) attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing, 2) perceived ease·of general computer use and 3) general technology use. However, the literature did not indicate that these associations had been empirically tested. Parasuraman and Colby's (2001) groundbreaking ·study examined technology readiness among American adults 18 years or older. The findings from their nationwide survey (n=1,000) revealed an age-related difference in the participants' state of technology readiness. Younger adults < 30 years old were more optimistic about technology than older adults .2: 65 years. This age-related difference was congruent with the results reported by Ramayah et al. (2003). In that

22

study, the researchers examined the technology readiness of business managers and found statistically significant differences in technology readiness based on age
(~ 100 > =

10.84; p < 0.01 ).

In general, managers who were younger (i.e. 21-30 years) were more techno-ready than managers who were older. Ramayah et al. (2003) also reported a statistically significant education-related difference in the managers' technology readiness
(~ 100 > =

11.90;p < 0.01). Ninety percent of the participants

were college/university graduates. Managers who had an undergraduate degree were more techno-ready than those who had either a high school/college diploma or a graduate degree. The findings from that study might have reflected the intergenerational differences between those who grew up in an age of ubiquitous ICT use and those who had not. However, it was difficult to draw·meaningful conclusions from the finding that managers with undergraduate degrees were more techno-ready than managers with high school/college diplomas or graduate degrees in the absence of information pertaining to the age of the managers in each group. On one hand, it was conceivable that the managers with high school/college diplomas and graduate degrees might have been older; in which case the results might be attributed to the age-related difference in technology readiness that was also found. On the other hand, given the education-related difference one might have expected that managers with graduate degrees would have been more techno-ready than their less educated counterparts. The paradoxical findings rendered the results inconclusive. Taken together, the results of these two studies provided some empirical evidence of an age-related difference in technology readiness in the general population and among business managers. On the basis of this evidence, it seemed reasonable that an age-related difference in technology readiness might be found among first year nursing students-a population which,

23

based on a recent Statistics Canada report, was considered diverse in terms of age (Allen et al., 2007). No published studies have yet investigated this potential difference. First year nursing students are also considered diverse in terms of their prior academic experience (Allen et al., 2007). Since previous research had not clearly established a correlation between education and technology readiness, further studies are warranted particularly in academic settings such as SONs where the use of technology is becoming more prevalent. Four studies were found that examined technology readiness among university students (Hendry, 2000; Lai, 2008; Roper, 2006; Vander Rhee et al., 2007). · However, none investigated the correlation between education and technology readiness in the population of interest. Roper's (2006) study investigated the technology readiness of students enrolled in various American colleges and universities. The average age of the participants was 21 years. One of the study's primary purposes was to examine the relationship between the students' technology readiness and their expectations about whether or not educational technology would be used in the classroom. Overall, the students were found to have above average technology readiness but there was no statistically significant relationship between their technology readiness scores and their expectations regarding the use of educational technology. Clayton-Pedersen and O'Neill (2005) provided a possible explanation for Roper's findings. According to those authors, contemporary college/university students' "low expectation for the use of technology in the curriculum is not surprising" (p. 9.1) in light of educators' pervasive us.e of "low-level technologies such as overhead projectors" (p. 9.4) and the lack lustre use of technology simply for researching information, word processing or accessing course content online. From the authors' perspective, these typical uses of technology in the curriculum pale in comparison to the more sophisticated technologies that these students generally use in their personal lives such as

24

hand-held games and instant messaging programs. This perspective is relevant as it suggests that students might in fact be more computer literate at home than is reflected by their expectations at school. Thus, when examining the relationship between technology readiness and computer literacy it would be important to understand the students' computer use at home as well. The other three studies that explored technology readiness among university students focused on its correlation to their preferred mode of education delivery (e.g. online, face-to-face or a combination of both). For example, Hendry (2000) designed a descriptive correlational study to investigate the relationship between technology readiness and university students' preferences for one of three different options used to deliver the same course content: face-toface, print-based distance education with telephone tutorial assistance or online with online tutorial assistance. Hendry's sample was comprised of 11 7 undergraduate students enrolled in a first year marketing class. The researcher reported a statistically significant correlation between the students' technology readiness and their choice of education delivery format (r = -.36; p < .05). The students who opted for the online course were more techno-ready than those who chose to enrol in either the distance education or face-to-face versions of the course. Additionally, a greater percentage of the students in the face-to-face course were techno-resistant when compared to the percentage of techno-resistant students enrolled in either the online or distance education course. Vander Rhee et al. (2007) had similar findings. The authors examined 643 students enrolled in a Master of Business Administration degree program. The majority of the participants were males::=: 33 years. Those researchers reported a statistically significant difference in the students' technology readiness scores based on their choice of educational delivery format. The students with higher technology readiness scores had a greater preference for mixed classes (i.e.

25

combined face-to-face and online components) (t< =38.9;p < .001) when compared to students 582 > with low scores who preferred face-to-face classes. Those two studies provided support for the relationship between technology readiness and preference for the use of a technology-based educational format. Given that online courses are typically accessed using a computer, the findings from these two studies imply that there may be a relationship between students' beliefs about and attitude towards technology use in general (i.e. technology readiness) and their attitude towards computer use in general. However, this association was not directly tested and neither of the studies included first year nursing students. Therefore, these results further support the need to investigate technology readiness and attitude towards computers in this population. The final study that examined technology readiness among university students used a descriptive design to investigate the technology readiness of professional chartered accountants (n=11 0) in Malaysia who were pursuing higher education in preparation for an advanced certification examination (Lai, 2008). Sixty-three percent of the sample was 21-25 years old; 37% was 26-30 years and the remaining four percent was> 30 years. The researcher reported that almost 50% of the students surveyed were highly (6%) or somewhat techno-ready (41 %) and 38% were average techno-ready. The remaining 15% were somewhat or highly techno-resistant. The researcher did not explicitly examine the correlation between age and technology readiness. However, given that 96% of the sample was < 30 years and 85% demonstrated some degree of technology readiness, the findings suggested that students < 30 years might be techno-ready. However, males constituted 30% of the sample. Thus, the demographic profile differed from first year nursing students who historically have been predominantly female. For that reason, Lai's

26

findings were not generalizable to the population of interest and thus supported the need for the present study. As previously stated, no published studies have examined technology readiness in a nursing context. Nonetheless, two studies were found that explored nursing students' general attitude towards technology. Maag (2006), for example, used a descriptive research design to examine a mixed sample of undergraduate and graduate degree nursing students. Approximately, eight percent of the participants were first year nursing students. The researcher measured the students' attitudes towards technology (including computers) on two dimensions-confidence in and benefits of using technology, and lack of self-efficacy in using technology. Overall, the first year nursing students had a moderately positive attitude towards technology. Maag also reported a statistically significant age-related difference in the students' scores on one dimension of attitude towards technology (p < 0.001). More specifically, when compared to their older counterparts, the younger students (i.e . .::; 21 years, n=348) scored lower on the dimension confidence in using technology. This finding seems inconsistent with the results reported by Parasuraman and Colby (2001). In that study, adults who were< 30 years were more technoready than adults> 65 years. However, since Maag did not specifically measure technology readiness, the results from these two studies are not entirely comparable. Therefore, further research is warranted to explore technology readiness in the population of interest. In contrast, there was more consistency between Maag' s (2006) findings and the results reported by Schwirian et al. (1989). Those authors examined sophomore nursing students' general attitude towards technology and their attitude towards computer use in general (the findings for the latter are reviewed in the section on attitude towards computer use in general). The authors defined attitude towards technology as the extent to which the students perceived

27

technology as a threat or asset to humans. The study found that, on average, the students had a positive attitude towards technology and this was statistically significantly correlated to their attitude towards computers (r=0.52,p < 0.001). Viewed as a whole, the studies by Maag (2006) and Schwirian et al. (1989) provide some evidence to suggest that nursing students may have a positive attitude towards technology/ computers use in general but there may be varying degrees of confidence in using the technology. However, neither of these studies was conducted in Canada; nor, did either specifically target first year nursing students enrolled in baccalaureate nursing degree programs. Therefore, these findings support the need for further research to explore this phenomenon in the population of interest. In summary, results from consumer research provided evidence to support a relationship between peoples' beliefs about and attitude towards technology use in general (i.e. technology readiness) and their use of specific types of technology. There was also empirical evidence to support an age-related difference in technology readiness specifically in the general population and among business managers. There was some evidence suggesting that technology readiness might be related to education but no definitive inferences could be made because of inconclusive results. Previous findings also implied that a person's general technology readiness might be associated with his/her attitude towards the use of a specific type of technology such as the computer; this association has not been tested empirically. Four studies were found that investigated technology readiness among university students; however, none was conducted in a Canadian context. One of these four studies found no empirical evidence to support a relationship between technology readiness and students' expectations regarding the use of educational technology in the classroom. The theoretical literature suggested that this finding

28

might have been attributed to the overall low-level technologies used in university settings which were typically less sophisticated than the technology students used in their personal lives. Therefore, in examining the relationship between computer literacy and technology readiness, it might be necessary to understand students' computer use at home as well. Two of the four studies involving university students provided evidence in support of a relationship between technology readiness and preference for the use of a technology-based educational format. Since online courses are typically accessed using a computer, the findings from these two studies implied that there might be a relationship between students' general technology readiness and their general attitude towards computer use. This association was not tested empirically and neither of the studies included first year nursing students. The findings of the fourth study suggested that students< 30 years might be techno-ready but the findings had limited generalizability to the population of interest due to differences in the demographic profile. Two studies were found that examined nursing students' general attitude towards technology and they found that overall there was a positive attitude towards technology use in general but there may be varying degrees of confidence in using the technology. Neither of these studies was conducted in Canada nor exclusively examined first year nursing students enrolled in baccalaureate nursing degree programs. Taken together, these results further support the need to investigate technology readiness among Canadian first year nursing students.

Attitude Towards Computers
For the purposes of this study, the empirical literature pertaining to nursing students' attitude towards computers was reviewed on two dimensions: 1) attitude towards computer use in general, and 2) attitude towards computer use in nursing. Very few studies were found that specifically targeted first year nursing students. Therefore, the scope of the studies reviewed in

29

this section was expanded to include students enrolled in different types of nursing programs (i.e. diploma, baccalaureate and graduate programs) as well as students that were in different years of their programs.
Attitude Towards Computer Use in General

This section, which reviews empirical literature pertaining to nursing students' attitude towards computer use in general, includes studies involving samples comprised of students enrolled in different types of nursing programs. For instance, Sinclair and 'Gardner (1999) used a descriptive, correlational design to explore entry-level diploma nursing students' general attitude towards computer use on three dimensions: 1) confidence in using computers, 2) motivation to use computers, and 3) perceived importance of computer use. The authors reported that the students expressed positive attitudes towards computer use in general. There was a statistically significant difference in the students' confidence in general computer use based on their previous computer training. Students without previous training scored statistically significantly lower (p < .001) when compared to those who had previous training. Overall, the students had a moderate degree of motivation towards computer use in general and there was overall agreement regarding the perceived importance of computer use. In contrast, the students' mean scores for confidence in using computers were much lower than the scores they obtained on the other two dimensions of attitude towards computers. Thomas et al. (1992) examined the effect of incorporating content on computer technology in the nursing curriculum on students' general attitude towards computer use. The results of their quasi-experimental, single group, pretest-posttest design revealed a statistically significant difference in the pretest and posttest attitudinal scores of the 48 students in their study (t <47>= 3.61, p <0.001). The authors reported that the students had a more positive attitude towards

30

computer use in general at posttest (i.e. after completing the computer technology content) implying that their general attitude towards computer use might be associated with increased ICT use. Bachman and Panzarine (1998) used a nonequivalent, pretest-posttest, control group design to investigate the effects of an information technology course on students' general attitude towards computer use. The sample was comprised of 43 registered nurses enrolled in a baccalaureate nursing degree program. The majority of the participants had been in nursing for an average of 11 years and used a computer either at home or at work. The researchers found that the students had a positive attitude towards the use of computers at pretest and there was no statistically significant difference in their scores at posttest when compared to their pretest scores
(f (37) = 3.34, p >0.05).

Birx et al. (1996) used a quasi-experimental design to explore the effects of a course that required students to use laptop computers on their attitude towards computer use in general. The sample consisted of 38 senior nursing students who were reported to have had very positive attitudes toward computer use in general at pretest. Consistent with Bachman and Panzarine' s (1998) findings, there was no statistically significant difference in the students' attitude at posttest (t <37> = 1.13, p > 0.05) when compared to their pretest scores. Using a pretest-posttest mixed design, Newman and Howse (2007) investigated the effect of a personal digital assistant documentation tutorial on nursing students' general attitude towards the use of hand-held computers. The study involved 56 fourth year baccalaureate degree nursing students. Eightypercent of the students were 20-24 years old; the remaining 20% were 2: 25 years old. Most of the students (56%) had at least 10 years of computer experience. Congruent with the previous two studies, the researchers reported that the students had very

31

positive attitudes towards computer use in general at pretest and there was no statistically significant difference at posttest (t (55)= .80, p >0.05). Viewed as a whole, these studies provide some evidence to suggest that nursing students may have a positive attitude towards computer use in general. None of the previous studies reviewed were conducted in Canada; nor, did any specifically target first year nursing students enrolled in a generic 4-year baccalaureate nursing degree programs. In addition, only one of those studies was conducted in the last decade and that study examined the effect of a tutorial on nursing students' attitude towards the use of a personal digital assistant (i.e. hand-held computer). Therefore, these findings support the need for further research to explore this phenomenon in the population of interest to expand nursing knowledge in this area.

Attitude Towards Computer Use In Nursing
The review of the literature revealed several studies that focused on nursing students' attitude towards computer use in nursing. Reznikoff, Holland and Stroebel (1967), for example, examined various personnel working in a local hospital to determine their attitude towards the recent implementation of a new computerized system. Of the eight occupational classifications included in the study, student nurses were found to be the most consistently negative towards the use of computers. The researchers attributed the nursing students' "marked negativism" (p. 424) to their perception that computer use in nursing was dehumanizing. A follow-up study in the same year also focused on nursing students' attitude towards computer use in nursing (Rosenberg, Reznikoff, Stroebel & Ericson, 1967). In that study, Rosenberg et al. examined the effect of increased exposure to computers in the clinical setting on nursing students' attitude towards the use of computers. The sample was comprised of 54 junior and senior nursing s~dents from five nursing diploma programs. Using a quasi-experimental

32

single group pretest-posttest design, the researchers found a statistically significant change in the students' attitude towards the use of computers at posttest (i.e. after exposure to computers in the clinical setting) when compared to their pretest scores. Although these two studies were conducted four decades ago, the results lend some support to the hypothesized relationship between attitude towards computers and computer literacy. However, the findings were based on samples of diploma nursing students and therefore might not be generalizable to the population of interest in this study. In contrast, Schwirian et al.'s (1989) 3-year longitudinal study involved three successive cohorts of sophomore baccalaureate degree nursing students (n=353) and staff nurses (n=358) from two hospitals in the U.S. The authors compared the attitudes of the nurses and nursing students towards computer use in nursing. The researchers concluded that the students' attitude towards computers were significantly (p < .001) more positive than the nurses' attitudes. These results were attributed to the nurses' negative experiences resulting from the use of unreliable computer systems. Given the demographic profile of the students in this study and the passage of time (almost two decades), the findings might have limited generalizability to contemporary first year nursing students in a Canadian context. This conclusion was based on the assumption that contemporary nursing students' experience with, and exposure to, computers would likely be quite different when compared to the students in Schwirian et al. 's study. McBride and Nagle's (1996) research was the only Canadian study found. It was primarily designed to evaluate the psychometric properties of a widely used (at that time) research instrument-the Nurses' Attitude Towards Computers Questionnaire (NATC). Stronge and Brodt's (1985) 20-item NATC was a multi-dimensional scale designed to measure specific nursing concerns about the use of computers in the clinical setting. These concerns were: 1) job

33

security, 2) legal implications, 3) impact on patient care, 4) effectiveness, 5) resistance, and 6) organizational benefits. The maximum possible score was 100, which was consistent with a very positive attitude towards computer use in nursing. The convenience sample in McBride and Nagle's (.1996) study included 362 registered nurses and 299 nursing students from all four years of a baccalaureate degree program (1 05 were first year nursing students). The students' overall mean NATC score was 74.58 (SD=9.11), which the researchers interpreted as "a somewhat positive attitude toward computers" (p. 167). The authors did not report the participants' attitude scores based on the number of years in the nursing program. Therefore, it was impossible to determine first year nursing students' attitude towards computer use in nursing in a Canadian context from the results of that study. In summary, previous research suggested that nursing students might have a positive attitude towards computer use in nursing and their attitude might be associated with their previous computer experience. Most of the studies were conducted in the U.S. and none investigated first year nursing students exclusively. Therefore, the findings were not generalizable to the population of interest.

Computer Literacy
Many researchers have investigated nursing students' self-perceived computer literacy in terms of their general proficiency in using e-mail, word processing, presentation software, spreadsheets, bibliographic databases and the Internet (Bachman & Panzarine, 1998; Birx et al., 1996; Gassert & McDowell, 1995; Graveley et al, 1999; McDowell & Ma, 2007; Thomas et al., 1992). Graveley et al. (1989), for example, investigated the self-reported computer literacy of undergraduate nursing students at the time of admission. According to the researchers, almost 50

34

percent of the participants did not perceive themselves as computer literate when asked about their ability to use various applications including word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail and the Internet. According to the authors, the study findings suggested that first year nursing students might not have the level of computer literacy expected of them. Since that study was published, nursing researchers have repeatedly expressed concerns about the computer literacy of first year nursing students (Gassert & McDowell, 1995; McDowell & Ma, 2007; Thomas et al., 1992). The results of the most recent study by McDowell & Ma suggested that first year nursing students' computer literacy may have improved in some areas. More specifically, during their 8year longitudinal study, McDowell and Ma (2007) found that each new cohort of first year nursing students reported a higher level of proficiency in word processing, email and Internet use upon admission when compared to previous years. However, during that time frame, there was no statistically significant change in the participants' self-perceived proficiency with respect to spreadsheets, databases (bibliographic and data management tools), presentation graphics software, and the use of computerized statistical programs. The participants had some experience with those applications but were unable to use them independently. The study findings suggested that first year nursing students' computer literacy might be application-specific. Thomas et al. (1992) also investigated the correlation between computer literacy and students' attitude towards computer use in general. This study used a single group, pretest/posttest design to evaluate changes in nursing students' computer literacy after completing a unit on computer technology. The participants (n=48) in this study were generic and post-registered nursing students. The authors reported that the participants' posttest computer skills scores were positively related to their computer attitudes scores at a statistically

35

significant level (r=.41, p < .05). Thus, these results suggested that there might be a relationship between students' computer literacy and their attitude towards computer use in general. Summary of Empirical Literature and Implications for this Study To summarize, there is a growing body of research pertaining to technology readiness from a consumer research perspective. A few of these studies have investigated students' technology readiness but none involved first year nursing students. Previous research findings provided empirical evidence of an age-related difference in technology readiness in the general population and among business managers. Earlier studies also suggest that there might be an age-related difference in nursing students' confidence in using technology (i.e. one dimension of attitude towards technology). The existence of an education-related difference in technology readiness was less clear in previous studies. Taken together, these findings suggested that there might be an age-related difference in first year nursing students' attitude towards computers. However, this association was not previously investigated empirically in the population of interest. Similarly, previous study findings supported the need to further explore a possible education-related difference in technology readiness, particularly among first year nursing students. A small number of researchers have investigated nursing students' attitude towards computer use. The results of those studies suggested that nursing students might have a positive attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing. Only one study was found that examined first year nursing students' general attitude toward computer use. That study examined post-registered nursing students enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program. Therefore, the results were not generalizable to the population of interest. One study examined attitude towards computer use in nursing in a Canadian context but the results were inconclusive because of its

36

mixed sample and limited reporting on the findings pertaining to the first year nursing students in the study. Collectively, these studies revealed that there was no empirical evidence of Canadian first year nursing students' attitudes toward computer use in general or in nursing. Previous research findings suggested that first year nursing students' computer literacy may have improved in recent years and is application-specific with greater proficiency reported in the use of word processing, email and the Internet. Some findings also suggested that there might be a relationship between students' attitude towards computer use in general and their computer literacy. However, there was no empirical support for this correlation in the population of interest. In conclusion," there are a number of gaps in the empirical literature. First, no published studies have examined technology readiness or possible correlates (particularly age and education) among Canadian first year nursing students. Second, no studies were found that investigated the attitude of Canadian first year nursing students towards computer use in general and in nursing. Third, previous studies have not examined the level of computer literacy among a cohort of Canadian first year nursing students. Fourth, previous studies have also not explored possible interrelationships among general technology readiness, attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing and general computer literacy. The present study will provide preliminary evidence to begin to address these gaps in the literature and advance nursing knowledge development on this topic.

CHAPTER 3: FRAMEWORK
Introduction
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first section describes the study framework and the study variables. The second section presents the research questions and hypotheses. The chapter concludes with the third section, which discusses the assumptions that have been made with respect to the study framework.

Study Framework
Parasuraman (2000) accentuated the need for further studies to explore conceptual models in which technology readiness was a core construct. In accordance with this identified need, this study framework integrated technology readiness within the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a theoretical framework that was originally developed to explain and predict individuals' adoption of computer systems (Davis, 1989, 1993; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989). Grounded in Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) Theory of Reasoned Action, the TAM postulates that a person's preparedness to use a particular computer system is associated with his/her cognitive response to the system. This cognitive response reflects what he or she perceives about the system's usefulness (PU) and ease of use (PEOU) (Davis, 1993). Using the work environment as his frame of reference, Davis (1989) defined PU as: "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance" (p. 320). In the same context, the author defined PEOU as: "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort" (p. 320). As shown in Figure 3, Davis also hypothesized that external variables, such as individual characteristics, shape a person's cognitive response. The TAM also presupposes a correlation between an individual's cognitive response and his/her attitude towards using the system, which was defined as "the degree of 38

evaluative affect that an individual associates with using the target system in his or her job" (p. 476). Finally, Davis (1989) proposed that a person's affective response (i.e. attitude towards system use) is directly related to his/her actual system use, which he envisioned as a multidimensional concept encompassing both utilization and proficiency.

The following case study is offered to further explicate the relationships proposed in the TAM. In this case study, a hospital has decided to implement an electronic documentation system, which staff nurses are expected to use. According to the TAM, the nurses' decision to embrace and use the electronic documentation system would be related to their cognitive response to the system. More specifically, the nurses' decision would be determined by their beliefs about the system's usefulness and ease of use. The TAM further states that the nurses' cognitive response would be shaped by external variables such as their previous experiences with computer use in nursing and whether or not the system design was counterintuitive. In addition, the TAM proposes that the nurses' perception of the system's usefulness and ease of use would be positively related to their affective response (i.e. their favourable/unfavourable attitude) 39

toward the system and indirectly determine whether they used the system for documentation or continued to use paper charts for that purpose. Nurses who perceived the system to be useful and easy to use would be most likely to develop a positive attitude towards the system and ultimately adopt its use.

Study Variables
As previously stated, the study framework extended the theoretical perspectives advanced by Davis (1989) and Parasuraman (2000) by incorporating technology readiness as a variable within the TAM. Parasuraman identified the need for additional studies to increase knowledge about the correlates of technology readiness. Thus, the study framework (see Figure 4) was designed to examine two hypothesized correlates of technology readiness-age and education. A recent report from Statistics Canada revealed that first year nursing students are diverse in terms of age with a large percentage being older than 25 years (Allen et al. , 2007). In light of this trend to enrol in SONs at an older age, it was anticipated that some first year nursing students would have completed various types of postsecondary education at the time of admission (Allen et al., 2007). There is empirical evidence of an age-related difference in peoples' technology readiness in populations other than first year nursing students (Ramayah et al., 2003; Parasuraman & Colby, 2001 ). In addition, Ramayah et al. found some empirical support suggesting that there may be an education-related difference in technology readiness among nonnurses. Given the diversity in age reported by Statistics Canada, it was therefore hypothesized that there would also be age- and education-related differences in first year nursing students'

technology readiness. To reflect this hypothesis, the study framework depicts age and education as external variables and correlates of technology readiness. Previous research by Lin, Shih and Sher (2007), W alczuch et al. (2006) and Lemmink and Streukens (2007) established empirical associations between technology readiness and the cognitive dimensions of the TAM-PU and PEOU. In contemplating future avenues for research on this topic, Lin et al. described these cognitive responses as value-based. They asserted that in an academic context, students might place less value on PU and more on PEOU. The authors supported this assertion by emphasizing the priority that students give to the social value of wanting to 'fit in' with their peers. Therefore, from their perspective, the social value might play a greater role than the functional value of PU in influencing the students' adoption of the system. Conversely, according to Lin et al., students may be less likely to use the system if they perceive it to be too difficult. Therefore, the authors believed that PEOU might play a greater role in students' responses to the use ofiCT. These empirical associations between technology readiness and the cognitive dimensions of the TAM, coupled with Lin et al.'s theoretical perspective, provide the basis for two propositions incorporated within the study framework: 1) students' technology readiness might be related to their beliefs about the perceived ease of using a specific type of technology-the computer, and 2) students' perceived ease of using the computer might be associated with their attitude toward computer use in general and in nursing. There is also empirical support for an association between technology readiness and attitude towards different types of wireless technology ranging from r=0.32 to r=0.47 (Chang & Kannan, 2006). Thus, it was hypothesized that there might be a correlation between first year nursing students' technology readiness and their attitude towards the computer-another type of

42

technology. In addition, Davis (1989) established empirical associations between the TAM's affective and behavioural dimensions implying that there might be a correlation between first year nursing students' attitude towards computers and their computer literacy (i.e. their actual use of the computer). Figure 4 portrays these relationships. Finally, there was some empirical evidence of an association between technology readiness and the use of various technology-based products and services such as online airline check-in (Liljander et al., 2005) and wireless technology (Chang & Karman, 2006). Thus, in the context of this study, it was hypothesized that there would be a correlation between technology readiness and computer literacy. However, this relationship had not been supported empirically. For that reason, the study framework portrayed this hypothetical relationship using a broken line leading from technology readiness to computer literacy.

Conceptual and Operational Definitions Technology Readiness
Technology readiness was conceptually defined as an amalgam of positive and negative technology-related beliefs and feelings that co-exist and collectively shape a person's proclivity towards embracing and using new technology in general. Technology readiness was measured based on the participants' self-report on the Technology Readiness Index (TRI).

Perceived Ease of Computer Use
Perceived ease of computer use was conceptually defined as the extent to which students generally believe that using the computer would be relatively simple. This variable was measured based on the participants' self-report on the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) scale.

43

Attitude Towards Computers Attitude towards computers was conceptually defined as a multi-dimensional affective response to the notion of interacting with computers to accomplish specific tasks. For the purposes of this study, this variable was measured on two dimensions. The first dimension, attitude towards computer use in general, was described as the affective evaluation of one's ability to learn about and use computers in general. This dimension was measured based on the participants' self-report on the Computer Confidence (CC) scale. The second dimension, attitude towards computer use in nursing, was described as a person's emotional response to the integration of computers in clinical settings to facilitate nursing care. This dimension was measured based on the participants' self-report on the Nurses' Computer Attitude Inventory (NCATT). Computer Literacy Computer literacy was conceptually defined as a multi-dimensional behavioural response. It encompassed frequency and duration of general computer use as well as general computer proficiency, which was described as the self-reported skill in using various computer applications. For the purposes of this study, computer use was only reported descriptively. However, computer proficiency was reported descriptively and was also used to measure computer literacy for hypothesis testing. This study variable was measured based on the participants' self-report on the Computer Literacy Assessment Scale (CLAS). Age Age was defined as the number of completed years since birth and was measured in years based on the participants' self report on the Demographic Assessment Tool (DAT).

44

Education
Education was defined as the highest level of formal schooling completed. It was also measured based on the participants' self report on the DAT.

Summary ofStudy Framework
To summarize, the study framework extended the TAM by integrating technology readiness as one of its variables. The framework hypothesized that first year nursing students' age and education were correlates of their technology readiness. Hypothetical relationships were also envisioned between technology readiness and the cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions of the TAM (i.e. perceived ease of use, attitude towards computers and computer literacy). Finally, the framework hypothesized that attitude towards computers was related to the behavioural response to computers. These propositions were theoretically and empirically supported by the literature reviewed in Chapter 2. The specific research questions that were addressed in the study are delineated below.

Research Questions and Hypotheses
As previously discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, there is limited knowledge about first year nursing students' technology readiness, attitude towards computers and computer literacy, particularly in a Canadian context. Therefore, the following research questions were formulated to begin to address this gap in the literature:

Hypotheses
On the basis of the presumed technology-related age dichotomy, it was hypothesized that there would be an age-related difference in the participants' technology readiness. The cut-off point that establishes the digital dichotomy is believed to be 1982 implying that, currently, students ::: 26 years would be more techno-ready than those who were > 26 years old. However, for the purposes of this study, it was decided to use age 21 as the cut-offin accordance with previous research (Maag, 2006).
It was also presumed that there would be an education-related difference in the students'

technology readiness given: 1) the presumed technology-related education dichotomy, and 2) the data provided by Statistics Canada that some nursing students would have completed various types of postsecondary education at the time of admission given their age (Allen et al., 2007). Therefore, the first two hypotheses formulated to guide this study are: H1: There is a difference in first year nursing students' technology readiness based on their age. H2: There is a difference in first year nursing students' technology readiness based on their level of education.

46

Walczuch et al. (2007) reported a statistically significant relationship between general technology readiness and perceived ease of use. This correlation implies that people are more likely to have a propensity to embrace and use technology, in general, that they view as relatively easy to operate. There is also empirical support for an association between technology readiness and attitude towards computer use in general (Chang & Kannan, 2006). The implication of this finding is that people who are more receptive to general technology use might also be more positive about the potential benefits of the use of computers in general. Therefore, it was hypothesized that people who are open to embracing and adopting technology in general would more likely perceive general computer use as easy and have a positive attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing. More, specifically, the third hypothesis (H3) states: H3a: Technology readiness will be associated with perceived ease of computer use and attitude towards computers. H3b: There will be a relationship between perceived ease of computer use and attitude towards computers among first year nursing students. The TAM theorizes that there is a correlation between a person's affective and behavioural responses towards general computer use. This theoretical perspective implies that if a person has a positive attitude towards computer use in general and views them as beneficial he/she will be inclined to use the technology more frequently. A logical assumption is that this increased use would translate into increased proficiency. Thus, it was hypothesized that there is an association between first year nursing students' attitude towards computers and computer literacy. The fourth hypotheses (H4) states: H4: There is a relationship between first year nursing students' attitude towards computers and their computer literacy.

47

Finally, technology readiness is a mindset about general technology use that is thought to undergird a person's behaviour towards technology, in general. Therefore, in the context of this study, it was hypothesized that technology readiness would also be associated with the students' behaviour specific to computer use (i.e. computer literacy). Thus, the fifth hypothesis (H5) purports: H5: There is a relationship between first year nursing students' technology readiness and their computer literacy.

Assumptions
Several assumptions underpin the study framework, namely that: 1) age and education are correlates of general technology readiness, 2) technology readiness in general is related to the TAM's cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions-perceived ease of use, attitude towards computers and computer literacy, and 3) the affective responses to the computer is associated with overt behaviour indicative of computer literacy.

CHAPTER 4: METHOD AND PROCEDURES
Introduction
This chapter describes the method and procedures associated with this study. In particular, it delineates the research design, population and sample, setting, ethical considerations, measurement methods and the data collection and data analysis procedures.

Method

Research Design
This study used a descriptive correlational research design, which, according to Bums and Grove (2005) is appropriate for studies in which the intent is to identify the presence and/or strength of relationships.

Population and Sample
The target population was all first year nursing students enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program. The study design was based on the accessible population, which was comprised of all incoming first year undergraduate students enrolled at one site of a 4-year Collaborative Nursing Degree Program (CNDP) in Canada, for a potential sample size of 170 participants. This is the population to which the study findings will be generalizable. The CNDP is offered in partnership by a consortium of academic institutions that is comprised of two colleges and one university. Students enrolled in the CNDP may complete their first two years at any of the three partner sites. However, the final two years must be completed at the university site. Graduates of the program receive a Bachelor of Science (Nursing) designation. The results of a power analysis using a two-tailed test with the level of significance set at .01 and an effect size (ES) of .50 revealed that a sample size of 35 would yield 0.8 statistical
49

power (Bums & Grove, 2005). This sample size would therefore be large enough to address the study research questions thereby reducing the probability of either a Type I or a Type II error. A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is true (Bums & Grove, 2005). In other words, the researcher incorrectly assumes that there is a statistically significant difference between or among the study variables (Bums & Grove, 2005). Conversely, a Type II error, meaning acceptance of the null hypothesis when it is in fact false, would incorrectly imply that there are no relationships between or among the study variables in question (Bums & Grove, 2005). An alpha of .01, which is more conservative, was used to account for the multiple comparisons being planned. The decision to use an ES of .50, which falls within the medium range (.4 to .6) in Cohen's (1988) classification system, was based on the correlation coefficient values reported in previous studies, specifically: 1) a moderate relationship (r= 0.45,p < .001) between the affective responses attitude towards computers and attitude towards technology in general (Schwirian et al., 1989); and, 2) a moderate relationship (r= 0.4 7, p < .05) between technology readiness and attitude towards adopting wireless technology (Chang & Kannan, 2006). Bradburn (1992) purported that a sixty percent response rate is the norm for nonexperimental studies using a survey data collection methodology. Since there were approximately 170 prospective participants in the accessible population, a sixty percent response rate would translate into a sample size of 102. Given this anticipated response rate, the estimated sample size of 35 seemed attainable.

Setting
The setting was comprised of various classrooms and the Nursing Simulation Laboratory, which were all located on the campus of the participating site. The classrooms, which consisted

50

of desks and chairs and possibly some audiovisual equipment, were used during the recruitment phase. The Nursing Simulation Laboratory, which contained a lecture area and a simulated hospital unit, was also used during the recruitment phase as the drop-off location for the research questionnaires. There was no requirement to complete the questionnaires in this setting.

Ethical Considerations
The Research Ethics Board at the participating site approved the research protocol before any participants were recruited (see Appendix A). Participation in this study was on a voluntary basis only. Students were under no obligation to participate. To eliminate the risk and perception of faculty coercion, the researcher (who is a graduate student and not familiar with the students) was the sole recruiter and data collector. The researcher scheduled a number of information sessions during the recruitment phase to optimize the student' ability to make informed decisions. During these sessions, the researcher described the purpose of the research, the role of the participants, the consent process, the time commitment required, the potential risks and benefits, and the strategies that would be employed to protect their anonymity and confidentiality. At the end of each session, the investigator distributed the measurement tools along with the consent form (shown in Appendix B), which also served as a letter of information explaining the study and the participants' rights. Participants remained anonymous throughout the investigation; this was accomplished by: 1) using implied consent instead of a signed consent form (i.e. consent was implied if the participants returned their completed questionnaires), 2) pre-coding the questionnaires with a unique identifier used for tracking purposes only; and 3) having the participants return the 'name less' questionnaires to a predetermined drop-box. This decision to waive the written consent was considered appropriate by reason of the study's risk profile, which was determined to be

51

minimal. This risk profile is consistent with Bums and Grove's (2005) categorization in which studies with the potential to cause some temporary discomfort are considered "minimal-risk" (p. 190). Participation in this study was not expected to produce any physical, psychological, social, economic or legal harm to the participants. However, there was a small risk that participants who might have had some previous negative experience with computers and/or technology might have heightened emotional responses while completing some of the items on the research instruments. For that reason, the investigator informed the prospective participants of their right to withdraw from the study at any time and to refuse to answer any question(s) that made them feel uncomfortable. There were no financial costs either to the institution or to the participants and no incentives were provided for participation in the study. Prospective participants were advised that their decision to participate, or not, would have no impact on their grades, future academic status or potential employment opportunities with the participating site. Should the nursing faculty decide to use the study findings to guide future curriculum development initiatives this might be considered an indirect benefit to the participants. The data that were collected were stored in a locked drawer in the researcher's home office and were accessible by the researcher only. The data will be destroyed after five years.

Measurement Methods
Table 1 summarizes the six measurement tools that were utilized in this study. Five of these instruments used Likert scales, which generally measure ordinal level data. Many researchers view the values obtained on Likert scales as interval level data and treat them accordingly (Bums & Grove, 2005). This approach was used in the present study as well.

Note. a Parasuraman (2000) reported Cronbach Alpha's for the four subscales only.

The Demographic Assessment Tool (DAT), which was designed specifically for this study, measured relevant participant demographic information, namely: age, gender, ethnicity, education, previous computer training, and previous work experience in a health care facility. The DAT also asked about the participants' previous experience with information technology and explored their expectations with regards to their use of computers and technology in their future practice as registered nurses. With the exception of age, which was measured at the interval level, the DAT captured nominal and ordinal data. The Technology Readiness Index (TRI) measured the students' cognitive and affective responses to adopting and using technology in general (Parasuraman, 2000; Parasuraman & Colby, 2001 ). Rockbridge Associates Inc. holds the copyright for this instrument and granted permission to use the TRI for the purposes of this study on September 29, 2007 (see Appendix C). The TRI was considered appropriate for the present study by reason of its high reliability

53

and validity and its repeated use by other researchers to examine the general technology readiness of students enrolled in post-secondary educational institutions. Parasuraman and Colby (200 1) established the content validity of the TRI by conducting an extensive literature review and several focus group interviews with customers from a variety of sectors. They evaluated the instrument's psychometric properties during a multi-year, multiphase research program through an iterative process of reliability and factor analysis testing. This process, which yielded the 36-item TRI, involved an initial sample of approximately 1,200 college students and college graduates (.:Sage 35) and a subsequent sample of 1,000 adults (2: 18 · years old). The TRI demonstrated Cronbach's alpha for each of its four subscales ranging from .74 to .81, indicating acceptable reliability (Bums & Grove, 2005). Inferential statistical analysis determined that the TRI scores were consistently correlated with the participants' ownership or subscription to various technology-based products or services (including the Internet, cable television and cellular phone); thus, providing support for the instrument's construct validity. The 36-item TRI used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree 5=strongly agree. It measured four dimensions of general technology readiness---Qptimism (10 items), innovativeness (seven items), discomfort (10 items) and insecurity (nine items) (Parasuraman & Colby, 2001). According to the developers, optimism and innovativeness facilitate technology readiness whereas discomfort and insecurity impede general technology readiness. The items on the optimism and innovation subscales were primarily worded in a positive manner. There was one item on the innovativeness subscale that was negatively worded. Conversely, items on the discomfort and insecurity subscales were all expressed negatively. Negatively worded items on all subscales were reversed scored to calculate an overall TRI score ranging from 36 to 180. A TRI score of 100 is considered average (Parasuraman & Colby, 2001). During its

54

administration, the items on the research instrument were not grouped according to their classification. Instead, they were interspersed randomly in accordance with the developers' recommendations. The 4-item Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) questionnaire measured the participants' perceived ease of computer use. The PEOU used in this study was lgbaria, Zinatelli, Cragg and Cavaye's (1997) derivative ofDavis' (1989) original6-item instrument. Igbaria et al.'s version of the PEOU was chosen for the present study because: 1) it was short and easy to use, 2) it fit well with the conceptual definition of the variable perceived ease of computer use, and 3) variations of the PEOU have been used in numerous studies. Although none of these studies involved nursing students, the previous research by Dillon, McDowell, Salimian and Conklin (1998) did examine staff nurses' perceived ease of use of a hospital computer system. lgbaria et al. (1997) evaluated the psychometric properties of the 4-item PEOU while testing their multi-variable research model. The model was comprised of the constructs: internal computing support, external computing support, internal computer training, external computer training, management support, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and system usage. Psychometric testing included an examination ofPEOU's reliability coefficients as well as its construct validity. The researchers reported that the scale had an internal consistency reliability of .94, which was considered to be high reliability. To assess the PEOU's convergent and discriminant validity, Igbaria et al. examined the correlations between potentially overlapping instruments. They reported that the results revealed satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity.

55

In the present study the PEOU used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. The range of possible scores for the instrument was 4 to 20. Higher scores were indicative of more positive beliefs about the ease of computer use. The Computer Confidence (CC) scale measured the first element of the variable attitude towards computers-attitude towards computer use in general. The CC is a sub scale of the Technology Confidences and Attitudes (TCAT) Scales. The TCAT is comprised of three subscales: 1) computer confidence, 2) mathematics confidence (MC), and 3) attitudes to using technology when doing and learning mathematics (Cretchley, 2007). For the purposes of this study, the computer confidence subscale was used. To establish the CC's reliability, Cretchley (2007) conducted parallel forms testing to evaluate the CC's equivalence against TCAT's (MC) subscale. The MC was designed for such comparative purposes and is therefore, according to Cretchley, worded very similarly. The author reported that the content consistency between the parallel subscales demonstrated a reliability coefficient of .87. Cretchley also reported that the CC had a high correlation with the Galbraith-Raines Computer Confidence scale (r = 0.87,p < 0.01) when both forms were administered, in parallel, to 196 first year undergraduate students in 2000. The researcher then affirmed the CC's face validity by having it reviewed by a team of interdisciplinary experts, one of whom was an experienced research psychologist. The CC used an 11-item 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. Four items were positively worded and seven items were negatively worded to reduce the risk of response bias. Negative items were reverse scored before summing the responses to yield a range of possible scores from 11 to 55.

The CC has several characteristics that made it suitable for this study, namely: 1) it was relatively short, 2) it was designed to assess undergraduate students in a computer-enhanced learning environment, and 3) it had high reliability and validity. The Nurses' Computer Attitude Inventory (NCATT) measured the second dimension of the variable attitude towards computers-attitude towards computer use in nursing. J ayasuriya, Milbourne and Tooth (1994) developed the NCATT from an extensive review of the literature and other instruments. The NCATT was considered appropriate in this study because: 1) it was designed specifically to measure student and staff nurses' attitudes towards the use of computers, and 2) it had high reliability and validity (Jayasuriya & Caputi, 1996). Jayasuriya and Caputi (1996) evaluated the content validity through an expert panel review, which consisted of nurse educators and nurses who had previous experience with the use of computerized systems. Jayasuriya et al. evaluated the NCATT's psychometric properties in a study involving 170 participants comprised of first year nursing students (n=71) and staff nurses (n=99). Factor and item analyses demonstrated good internal consistency with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 for the instrument's three subscales. The authors also reported satisfactory concurrent validity (r =0.51,p < .0001 for the total score) between the NCATT and its predecessor, the Computer Attitude Scale, which Dambrot, Watkins-Malek, Silling, Marshall, and Garver (1985) developed. The 22-item NCATT used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. Sixty percent of the 22 items were expressed negatively to minimize the risk of response bias. Negative items were reversed scored before summing all of the responses. Possible attitude towards computer use in nursing scores ranged from 22 to 110.

57

The Computer Literacy Assessment Scale (CLAS) measured the participants' general computer literacy. For the purposes of this study, the author adapted this instrument from the computer system usage survey used by Igbaria et al. (1989) and Igbaria et al. (1997). Igbaria et al. (1997) established the reliability and validity of the computer system usage survey and the PEOU simultaneously using a multi-step process that was described in detail in a previous section of this chapter that described the PEOU in depth. lgbaria et al. reported an internal consistency reliability of .81 for the computer system usage scale. The computer system usage survey was considered appropriate for this study because: 1) its conceptual definition was compatible with the variable computer literacy, 2) it had acceptable levels of reliability and validity, and 3) it used a multidimensional approach to measure general computer use. The revisions made to the instrument for the present study were considered minor in nature. Therefore, pilot testing was not deemed necessary. Details of these changes are discussed below. The first change involved determining the measures of general computer literacy that would be evaluated in this study. lgbaria et al. 's (1989) survey included five measures of general computer use: 1) inclusion of computer analysis in decision making, 2) amount of time spent using the computer, 3) frequency of usage, 4) number of computer applications used, and 5) level of sophistication of usage. The version used by lgbaria et al. ( 1997) did not include the fifth dimension. The decision was made not to include the first measure (inclusion of computer analysis in decision making) in the CLAS because the questions were based on the work-related tasks normally performed by managers. These questions were not deemed appropriate for the population of interest. However, the fifth measure (level of sophistication) was considered to be relevant in the context of this study. Therefore, the CLAS was comprised of four dimensions: 1)

58

frequency of use, 2) time spent using a computer, 3) number of applications used, and 4) computer proficiency. The latter dimension was identical to the level of sophistication of usage-the label used by Igbaria et al. (1989). For simplicity, the labels were changed slightly in this study. The order in which the dimensions were presented on the CLAS was consistent with the other versions of the computer system usage survey. As well, in accordance with its predecessors, each of the dimensions was measured separately on the CLAS. The second revision pertained to the frequency of use rating scale. lgbaria et al.'s (1997) instrument used a 6-point rating scale to assess the participants' response to the question: "On average, how frequently do you use a computer for job-related work?" The range of responses was 1=less than once a month to 6=several times a day. For the purposes of this study, the wording of the question was changed to "On average, how frequently do you use a computer or laptop at home or at work?" As well, the lower end of the range was extended to 1=never or almost never. These revisions broadened the location of computer use and more accurately measured the number of participants who never or almost never used a computer/laptop at home or at work. It was recognized that participants may never have used a computer/laptop at home or at work but used one at school or at someone else's house. For that reason, an additional question was included in the CLAS that asked the participants who had never or almost never used a computer/laptop at home or work to provide a rationale. Six possible responses to this question were included on the basis of previous research studies. These responses were "no computer at home or at work", "don't feel comfortable using computers", "no need to use the computer", "don't know how to use a computer", "someone else uses the computer for you" and "other, please specify".

59

The third change was limited to the time spent using a computer scale. On Igbaria et al. 's (1997) computer system usage survey, the authors used a 6-point rating scale to assess the participants' response to the question: "On average, how much time do you spend per day using a computer for job-related work?" The range of responses was 1=almost never to 6=more than 3 hours. For the purposes of this study, the wording of the question was changed to "On average, how much time each day do you spend using a computer or laptop at home or at work?" As well, the wording on the lowest end of the scale was changed to 1=none or almost none. The rationale for these changes was the same as previously discussed in relation to the changes that were made to the wording on the frequency of use rating scale. The fourth amendment pertained to the list of applications that was used to assess the nature of the participants' computer use. Specifically, Igbaria et al.'s (1997) original list of applications was transcribed to the CLAS. However, the list was modified to provide more contemporary examples, such as JavaScript instead of COBOL for the programming language and Microsoft Access for the database (in addition to dBase, which was the example provided by Igbaria et al.). As well, two other applications were added to the list, namely: bibliographic databases (e.g. CINAHL) and health care specific applications (e.g. GRASP). The fifth change combined the third and fourth dimensions (number of computer applications used and computer proficiency, respectively). This change simplified the format of the instrument by eliminating the need to list the computer applications twice; once to identify the number of applications used and the second time to allow the participants to rate their level of expertise. Each of the CLAS' dimensions was measured separately. One·item measured the frequency of use score on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1=never or almost never to

60

?=several times a day. A l-item 6-point rating scale ranging from 1=none or almost none to 6=more than 3 hours measured time spent using a computer. The applications used dimension was measured as ratio level data by tallying the number of computer applications reportedly used by the participants. The possible range of scores was 0-10. The computer proficiency dimension was measured on a 10-item 6-point Likert scale ranging from O=never used to 5=expert. The computer proficiency score was the sum of the participants' self-reported levels of expertise for each application. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 50.

Procedures

Recruitment and Data Collection
Using a convenience sampling method, the researcher recruited prospective participants from the accessible population-the first year nursing students enrolled in each of the four sections of the Nursing Practice 1 (NSE12A/B) course at the participating site of the CNDP. Each section, which was comprised of a 1-hour lecture and a 2-hour lab, was scheduled on a different day and taught by a different Nursing Professor, each of whom facilitated the researcher's access to the population of interest. This sampling technique is acceptable for descriptive correlational studies (Burns & Grove, 2005). Given the risk of sampling error inherent in this sampling method (specifically systematic bias), the research design encompassed several strategies to maximize the sample size. To that end, there were no exclusion criteria and only one criterion for inclusion, namely: participants had to be enrolled in the first year of the CNDP at the participating site. The researcher recognized that p~rticipants in this study needed to be proficient in the English language. However, the research design did not incorporate this inclusion criterion because first

61

year nursing students enrolled in the CNDP are required to demonstrate their English language proficiency before they are granted admission. Recruitment flyers were posted on the students' bulletin boards, the Year 1 ListServ and in the Nursing Simulation Laboratory once the institution's Research Ethics Board approved the study protocol. The researcher also scheduled four face-to-face information and recruitment sessions on consecutive days (Tuesday to Friday) during week 8 of Semester I (October 30, 2007 to November 2, 2007). The researcher chose this timeline deliberately to avoid times when students were most likely to experience significant stress such as during mid-term. The researcher conducted these information and recruitment sessions during the first or last five minutes of the NSE 12A/B class lecture depending on the professors' preference. Face-to-face sessions were utilized in accordance with previous research evidence suggesting that a multimodal strategy and the use of face-to-face interactions might yield higher response rates (Dillman, 2007; Hox & De Leeuw, 1994). During the information sessions, the researcher described the purpose of the research, the role of the participants, the consent process, the time commitment required, the potential risks and benefits, and the strategies that would be employed to protect their anonymity and confidentiality. Questions and/or concerns were also addressed. At the end of each session, the · researcher distributed the study instruments and the consent form along with contact information to allow students to obtain further details or clarification, if needed. Students who chose to participate were initially asked to return the completed questionnaires after one week. However, this timeline was eventually extended by six weeks to maximize the sample size. This approach was based on Bums and Grove's (2005) assertion that allowing prospective participants time to make their decision increases the response rate.

62

Becker, Cookston and Kulberg (2000) found that reminder contacts increased the sample size. The greatest increase in response rates typically occurred after one or two reminder contacts (Dillman, 2007). In keeping with these findings, two reminder contacts were scheduled. The first reminder contact was conducted during the 2-week period immediately following the information sessions. These 5-minute reminder contact sessions were conducted at the start of NSE12 A/B. Given the relatively low response rate, a second reminder contact was conducted electronically during the first 2 weeks of semester II (once again to avoid times when students were most likely to experience significant stress such as during end of term). TheYear I Course Lead posted the reminder contact script (see Appendix D) on the Blackboard announcement page for NSE 12A/B. There was no other faculty involvement in recruiting the sample.

Data Analysis
All data were entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 15.0 as pre-coded on the research instruments. The variables age and gender were entered in their raw form. A total of six SPSS data files were created (one for each measurement tool). Each data file was printed and crosschecked for accuracy against the participants' raw data. The data were then assessed for missing values and outliers that might have skewed the results.

Missing Data
Missing data is a critical issue in research studies. If not handled appropriately, missing data increases the risk of systematic bias (El-Masri & Fox-Wasylyshyn, 2005). El-Masri and Fox-Wasylyshyn suggested that researchers evaluate two elements of"missingness" (p. 159) when they encounter missing data. Table 2 summarizes these elements-percentages and patterns-for the missing data in the present study.

63

Researcher error led to the exclusion of one item (INS6) from the insecurity subscale of the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). While attempting to randomize the items on the measurement tool, as recommended by the developers (to minimize the risk of response bias), the researcher inadvertently duplicated one item on the discomfort subscale (DIS 10) and omitted another (INS6). This error resulted in 100% missing data for INS6-an error considered to a systematic, as opposed to a random, pattern of non-response. Cohen and Cohen (1993) suggested that data might be retained for analysis if there is 10% or less missing data for any variable. Accordingly, the researcher made no attempt to substitute these missing data. Therefore, in this study, the TRI had valid data for 35 items only. The developer was contacted to validate this approach. There were 9 missing values on four research instruments, which represented less than 10% missing values for each item in the remaining participant data. In accordance with Cohen and Cohen's (1993) classification, this was considered replaceable missing data or data whose values could be imputed based on the pattern of"missingness" (El-Masri & Fox-Wasylyshyn, 2005, p. 159). The present study incorporated this protocol to facilitate the data analysis. Using the taxonomy of missing data described by El-Masri and Fox-Wasylyshyn (2005), the investigator identified the pattern of the replaceable missing data in this study as missing completely at random (MCAR) as shown in Table 2. According to these authors, missing data could be classified as MCAR "when the probability of missing data on one variable is independent of the values of that variable and of the values of the other variables in the data set" (p. 159). El-Masri and Fox-Wasylyshyn also asserted that case mean substitution is applicable for missing data on psychometric measures because it " is based on the assumption that, for any

given case, the score for one item is closely related to the scores of the remaining items" (p. 166). Previous research suggested that case mean substitution is a robust method that could be used to address missing values provided that the data were: 1) MCAR, and 2) obtained using a psychometrically sound measurement tool (El-Masri & Fox-Wasylyshyn, 2005). For these reasons, the researcher considered case mean substitution to be an appro"priate method to impute the values for the replaceable missing data encountered in this study.

Reliability Testing
In this study, Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated to evaluate the instruments' reliability-the consistency of the measure obtained (Bums & Grove, 2005). Bums and Grove purport that reliability is sample-specific, meaning that an instrument that is shown to have high reliability in one sample will not necessarily demonstrate the same reliability in another. For that reason, Bums and Grove recommended that reliability testing be conducted for each measurement tool that is used in a research study. This protocol was adopted in the present research.

65

Statistical Methods
All data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Categorical data were analyzed descriptively using frequency and percent distributions to summarize the data, describe patterns and explore deviations. Measures of central tendency (i.e. mean, median and mode) were calculated for the continuous variable age as well as for each variable measured by the research instruments. Measures of dispersion (specifically, range and standard deviation) were also examined to evaluate the degree of variability within the sample as well as within each variable measured by the research instruments. The descriptive analyses were completed first. Then, the data were examined inferentially. The level of significance was set at .01 for all tests. The two dimensions of attitude towards computer were measured on two separate scales. The approach to data analysis for these scales was the same as for the other study instruments. The first three dimensions of computer literacy were analyzed descriptively only. The fourth dimension, computer proficiency, captured some elements of use as well as proficiency with various
comput~r

applications. Therefore, it provided a broader view of the students' general

computer literacy than the other dimensions and was thus used as the measure of computer literacy for hypothesis testing. The first research question (RQ 1) sought to examine first year nursing students' general technology readiness, attitude towards computers use in general and in nursing, and general computer literacy. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to answer this question. Measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and measures of dispersion (range and standard deviation) were examined for the scores computed for each of these variables.

66

Technology readiness scores were grouped using the algorithm provided by the developers resulting in a possible range of scores on a continuum from + 16 to -16. These scores were categorized as follows: .1) highly techno-resistant (-16 to -1 0), 2) somewhat techno-resistant (-8 to -6), 3) average techno-ready (-4 to 1), 4) somewhat techno-ready (2 to 6), and 5) highly techno-ready (8 to 16). To simplify the reporting of the results for the variables attitude towards computers and computer literacy, the range of possible scores for each were categorized by dividing them into quartiles. For attitude towards computer use in general the categories were: 1) extremely low computer confidence (11-21 ), 2) moderately low computer confidence (22-32), 3) moderately high computer confidence (33-43), and 4) extremely high computer confidence (44-55). For attitude towards computer use in nursing the categories were: 1) extremely negative attitude towards computer use in nursing (22-43), 2) moderately negative attitude towards computer use in nursing (44-65), 3) moderately positive attitude towards computer use in nursing (66-87), and 4) extremely positive attitude towards computer use in nursing (88-11 0). For computer literacy the categories were: 1) extremely low computer proficiency (0-12), 2) moderately low computer proficiency (13-25), 3) moderately high computer proficiency (26-38), and 4) extremely high computer proficiency (39-50). These categories were used for descriptive purposes only, not for hypothesis testing. The second research question (RQ2) investigated age-related differences in the students' general technology readiness scores. H1 was established to explore RQ2. On the basis of previous studies, the technology readiness scores were dichotomized by age to create two new groups from the total sample (Maag, 2006; Sinclair & Gardner, 1999). One group was comprised of students (:S 21 years) and the other group consisted of students 2:22 years. To test H1, at-Test

67

for Independent Samples was performed to analyze the differences in the groups' technology readiness scores. The results indicated that the majority of the sample was .:S 21 years resulting in a marked discrepancy in the size of the groups, possibly limiting the power of the statistical test. In order to create more equal sized groups, a median split was then used to divide the total sample into two different groups based on age. The median age was 18 years. One group consisted of students aged 17-18 years and the other group was comprised of students 19-42 years. H1 was re-tested by performing a subsequent t-Test for Independent Samples to compare the scores for these groups. The third research question (RQ3) investigated education-related differences in the students' general technology readiness scores. H2 was formulated to guide the analysis ofRQ3. Two groups were created from the total sample to test H2. The first group consisted of those participants who had only completed high school. The second group was comprised of those participants who had completed some form of post-secondary education (college or university). This education dichotomy is consistent with the literature (Maag, 2006; Sinclair & Gardner, 1999). Differences in the groups' technology readiness scores were analyzed using t-Test for Independent Samples to test H2. The fourth research question (RQ4) explored associations among first year nursing students' general technology readiness, their perceived ease of computer use in general and their attitude towards computer use in general (i.e. computer confidence) and in nursing. To address RQ4, Pearson's correlations (two-tailed test) were computed to test the third hypothesis, which was further subdivided as follows: H3a: There is a relationship between technology readiness and perceived ease of computer use.

68

H3b: There is a relationship between technology readiness and attitude towards computer use in nurstng H3c: There is a relationship between technology readiness and computer confidence. H3d: There is a relationship between perceived ease of computer use and attitude towards computer use in nursing H3e: There is a relationship between perceived ease of computer use and computer confidence. The fifth research question (RQ5) examined the relationship between each dimension of attitude towards computers and general computer literacy. To address RQ5, Pearson's correlations (two-tailed test) were computed to test H4, which was subdivided as follows: H4a: There is a relationship between attitude towards computer use in nursing and computer proficiency. H4b: There is a relationship between computer confidence and computer proficiency. The first phase of the analysis used the general computer proficiency scores that were derived from the students' self-reported competence on the ten computer applications. The results revealed that some applications were unfamiliar to a large percentage of the students. Therefore, the proficiency scores were low. For that reason, the general computer proficiency scores were recalculated including the seven applications for which the percent distribution was
> 50%. The correlation coefficients were then recalculated to retest these hypotheses.

The sixth research question (RQ6) examined the relationship between general technology readiness and general computer literacy. To address RQ6, Pearson's correlations (two-tailed test) were computed using the general computer proficiency scores that were derived from the students' self-reported competence on the ten computer applications. For reasons previously

69

discussed the proficiency scores were low. Therefore, the general computer proficiency scores were recalculated using the same approach that was used for RQ5.

CHAPTERS: RESULTS
Introduction
This chapter presents the results of this study, the primary aim of which was to explore the general technology readiness, attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing and general computer literacy in a sample of Canadian first year nursing students. The first section describes the sample in terms of the response rate and demographic profile. The next section focuses on the study instruments and presents the results of the reliability testing and the exploratory data analysis. Finally, the third section communicates the research findings in relation to the research questions and hypotheses.

Sample

Response Rate
A total of 151 research packages were distributed. Twenty-five were returned to the drop box during the first week. Four more were returned after the first reminder contact. One additional set of questionnaires was received after the second reminder contact was posted to Blackboard. Thus, a total of thirty research packages were returned yielding a twenty percent response rate.

Demographic Profile
Table 3 summarizes selected data associated with the participants' demographic profile. The participants, who ranged in age from 17 to 42 years, were predominantly female. The mean age was 21 years (SD=6.2). The highest level of education completed by most of the participants was high school. A small percentage (1 0%) had a baccalaureate degree. Others had completed college (7%) or had taken some college/university courses (20% ). The participants' ethnicity varied widely; a large percentage (37%) was Caucasian.

Two-thirds of the participants had received some formal computer education; the most frequently reported site of which was high school. Seventy-seven percent of the students

72

described their ICT experience as average and one-tenth rated their experience as limited or weak. Twenty-six of the students had no previous health care experience. A few had previously worked in a health care facility as a volunteer (10%) or as a co-op student (3%). Of these, only one student had previously used a computer in that setting for health care-related purposes. Eighty percent expected to use ICT every shift as graduate nurses; 17% (n=5) expected to use the technology less frequently. One student (3%) did not know whether or not he or she would be expected to use ICT on a regular basis as a registered nurse.

Study Instruments

Reliability Testing
Table 4 communicates the alpha coefficients computed for the study instruments. All of the instruments demonstrated adequate internal consistency (i.e. a > .70).

Exploratory Data Analysis
This section presents the results of the exploratory data analysis, which was conducted to examine the distribution of instrument scores prior to proceeding with hypothesis testing. Overall, the scores on the study instruments were well dispersed. The results that were obtained for each are summarized in Table 4 and described separately below.

Technology Readiness Index (TRI)
The distribution of the participants' scores on the 35-item TRI (one item was discarded in this study) ranged from 56-128. As shown in Table 4, the median was 100.50 and the mean technology readiness score was 98.37 (SD=15.26).

Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)
The participants' perceived ·ease of computer use scores ranged from 4-20 and approximated a normal distribution. Table 4 demonstrates that the mean was 13.57 (SD=4.19) and the median was 15.00.

Computer Confidence (CC)
As shown in Table 4, the computer confidence scores ranged from 21-55 with a sample mean of39.03 (SD=7.50) and a median of 40.00.

Nurses' Computer Attitude Inventory (NCATT)
Table 4 summarizes the distribution of the participants' scores on the NCATT. As shown, the scores ranged from 54-99, within which they were well dispersed. The mean score was 77.60 (SD=10.82) and the median was 76.00.

74

Computer Literacy Assessment Scale (CLAS)
Table 4 presents the distribution of the scores for the computer proficiency dimension of the CLAS. As shown, the initial analysis revealed scores ranging from 13-43 (M=23.93; SD=7.62). The median was 22.00. In the subsequent analysis (i.e. after three items were excluded), the scores ranged.between 13-35. The mean score was 22.53 (SD=6.10) and the median was 21.50.
Findings Addressing Rese~rch Questions and Hypotheses
RQJ: What are the degree of technology readiness, the attitude towards computers, and computer

literacy in a cohort of Canadian first year nursing students?

Technology Readiness
Table 5 summarizes the categorization of the TRI scores, which ranged from 10 to -15. The mean was -2.03 (SD=5.18) and the median was -1.50 (1 to -4 is considered average). As shown, 53% of the students were classified as average techno-ready. Twenty percent demonstrated varying degrees of techno-resistance and three percent were considered to be highly techno-ready.

AUitude Towards Computers

Table 7 presents the results of the CC scores, which reflect the students' attitude towards computer use in general. The scores ranged from 21 to 55. As shown, 20% ofthe scores were between 11-32, which was indicative of either extremely or moderately low computer confidence. The remaining eighty percent of the scores were in the 33 to 55 range, reflecting either moderately or extremely high computer confidence.

Computer Literacy
The results of the descriptive analysis for each of four dimensions of computer literacy are summarized in Tables 9 and 10 and reported separately below.

Frequency of Computer Use
The scores on the frequency of computer use scale ranged from 6-7. The mean was 6.87 (SD=0.35) and the median was 7.00 indicating that all of participants reported a high frequency of computer use. The percent distribution (see Table 9) revealed that 87% of the students used a computer several times each day. All of the students used a computer/laptop at home or at work. 77

Time Spent Using Computer
The scores on the time spent using computer scale ranged from 4-6. The mean was 5.20 (SD=O. 76) and the median was 5.00. The percent distribution (see Table 9) shows that 80% of the students spent in excess of2 hours a day on the computer.

Application Use
The mean of the students' scores on the application use scale was 7.27 (SD=1.34). The range was 5-10 and the median was 7 .00. The frequency distribution shown in Table 9 indicates that all of the participants had previously used word processing, electronic mail and the Internet. The next most commonly used applications were spreadsheets, bibliographic databases and presentation graphics software. Forty percent or less of the sample had previous experience with health care applications, programming language or statistical analysis software such as SPSS.

Computer Proficiency
Table 10 presents the categorization of the computer proficiency scores. The initial analysis revealed scores ranging from 13 to 43. Sixty-three percent of the scores were between 13 and 25, which was indicative of moderately low computer proficiency. One-third of the scores were in the 26 to 38 range, reflecting moderately hi-gh computer proficiency. One student reported extremely high computer proficiency. The subsequent analysis included scores derived from the seven applications with percent distributions> 50%. This analysis revealed scores ranging from 13 to 35. Seventy percent of the scores were between 13 and 25, which was indicative of moderately low computer proficiency. The remaining thirty percent were in the 26 to 38 range reflecting moderately high computer proficiency.

RQ 2: Is there a difference in first year nursing students' technology readiness based on their

age? The group with students:=:: 21 years (n=23) had a mean technology readiness score of96.57 (SD=14.92). The group with students 2:22 years (n=7) had a mean technology readiness score ofM=104.29 (SD=16.02). No statistically significant differences were found in the technology readiness scores of these two groups (t<28 )=1.18; p=.25). In the subsequent analysis (i.e. after the total sample was regrouped using a median split), the group with students :S18 years (n=17) had a mean of97.35 (SD=14.00) and the group with students aged 19-42 years (n=13) had a mean of (99.69) (SD=17.27). There was no statistically significant difference in the groups' technology readiness scores based on age (t<28 )=0.41; p=.69). Therefore, H1 was not supported.
RQ3: Is there a difference in first year nursing students' technology readiness based on their

level of education? The mean technology readiness score of the students in group 1 (i.e. high school only) was 94.79 (SD=15.91) and in group 2 (i.e. some postsecondary education) the mean score was 104.55 (SD=12.40). These means were not statistically significantly different (t<28 )=1.75; p=.09). Therefore, H2 was not supported. 80

RQ4: What relationships exist among first year nursing students' technology readiness, their

perceived ease of use and their attitude towards computers? Table 11 presents a correlation matrix summarizing the results of this analysis. As shown, there was a statistically significant and moderate correlation between technology readiness and attitude towards computer use in nursing (r=.57,p=.01). There was also a statistically significant and strong correlation between technology readiness and computer confidence (r=.76; p=.01). Likewise, there was a statistically significant, strong relationship between technology readiness and perceived ease of use (r=.70,p=.01). Finally, as hypothesized, there were statistically significant correlations between perceived ease of use and each dimension of attitude towards computers ranging from r=.47 {p=.01) to r=.72 {p=.01). These results indicate that H3 was supported.

Summary
This chapter presented the results of the data analysis pertaining to the technology readiness, attitude towards computers and computer literacy of a sample of Canadian first year nursing students. The sample was largely comprised of females 21 years or younger whose ethnicity varied widely; however, a large percentage was Caucasian. The highest level of education completed by most of the participants was high school. Two-thirds of the students had taken some formal computer course, primarily in high school. Seventy-seven percent described their ICT experience as average. Very few students had previously worked in a health care facility. The major research findings are summarized and discussed in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 6: DISCUSSION
Introduction This chapter discusses the research findings. It begins with a discussion of the representativeness of the sample. Then, it discusses the results of the exploratory data analysis. Following this, the discussion centres on the key findings obtained for each of the research questions. The chapter concludes with a summary of this discussion.

Representativeness of the Sample The sample characteristics were compared to the demographic profile of first year nursing students in both Ontario and in Canada to evaluate its representativeness. A recent publication by the CNO (2007) revealed that in 2006, females accounted for 92% of new registered nurses both nationally and provincially. Thus, the proportion of female participants (97%) in the present study was higher than the national and provincial profiles. In 2006, the mean age of all new registered nurses was 28.6 years nationally and 26.5 years in Ontario (CNO, 2007). Most national and provincial entry-to-practice nursing education programs are 4-year generic baccalaureate degree programs (Canadian Nurses Association [CNA] & Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing [CASN], 2007). Therefore, the mean age of first year nursing students in 2002 would have been approximately 22.5 years in Ontario and 24.6 years in Canada. This calculation does not account for the timing of the collection of the data on which the joint CNA/CASN report was based. If the data were collected at the start of the school year, it might not accurately reflect the mean age of first year nursing students at the end of the school year, as some students may have been lost to attrition. Nonetheless, the estimated means provide some normative data against which to compare the representativeness of the sample. This comparison revealed that, with respect to the mean age (M=21 years; SD=6.2), the sample was closely 84

representative ofother first year nursing students in Ontario but lower than the national average. The CNO document does not report on the new nurses' highest level of education attained or their ethnicity. Therefore, the extent to which the sample is representative of the target population in terms of these two variables remains unclear.

Discussion of Exploratory Data Analysis
This section discusses the results of the exploratory data analysis with the intent of examining the mean scores obtained for the main study variables in light of previous research, for comparative purposes. Technology Readiness The present study was among the first to use the TRI in a sample of first year nursing students. Therefore, normative data do not exist for this population against which to compare the general technology readiness scores. Four other studies were found that examined this phenomenon among university students; of these, only one reported the composite technology readiness score (Roper, 2006). The mean score in that study (M=115.52; SD=12.82) was higher than the mean score (M=98.37; SD=15.26) in this study. However, as previously discussed, researcher error resulted in the removal of one item from the Technology Readiness Index. Therefore, the mean technology readiness score obtained in this study was derived from a 35item scale; this was incongruent with the mean score in Roper's study which was computed based on the original 36-item scale. Hence, the mean technology readiness score in this study was not comparable to the mean score reported in Roper's study. Attitude Towards Computers There is a paucity of studies that have used the CC or the NCATT to measure first year nursing students' attitude towards computer use in general or in nursing specifically. Therefore,

85

in the absence of normative scores, it was impossible to determine whether the students' scores in this study were comparable to results observed in previous research involving the population of interest. Two studies were found that used the NCA TT but neither of these reported the participants' scores. In the first study, the NCATT was administered to a sample comprised of first year nursing students and staff nurses with the aim of validating the instrument (Jayasuriya & Caputi, 1996). The other study investigated the effects of computer education and management support on attitudes toward computers, computer anxiety and subjective norms relative to computer use (Lai, 2008). The sample in that study consisted of nurses and other health care employees. The mean CC score (M=39.03; SD=7.50) in this study was lower than the mean score of 44.00 reported by Cretchley and Harman (2001). In that study, the researchers investigated a sample of 184 first year students enrolled in the first semester of undergraduate engineering, science and business degree programs. It is likely that the students' major influenced this difference in the scores. The results ofKvavik's (2005) study provided empirical support for this conclusion. In that study, the author investigated the level of technology skills in a sample of university students enrolled in various professional degree programs. The researcher found that the students' major played an important role in their skill level with students enrolled in business, engineering and life science being the most skilled. Thus, on the basis of these results, it is plausible that the business students may have had much greater exposure to computers and/or technology in their program when compared to the first year nursing students in this study. It is also possible that the inconsistencies noted in the CC mean scores were influenced by gender. Maag (2006) reported a statistically significant gender-related difference (p=. 01) in nursing students' confidence in using technology with males being more confident than females. Ninety-

86

seven percent of the students in this study were female. Although Cretchley and Harman (200 1) did not provide a detailed demographic profile of the students in their study, they did describe them as a large and diverse group of first year students. Hence, it is plausible that there was more diversity in gender in their sample when compared to the sample investigated in the present study.

Computer Literacy
No published studies were found that used a derivative oflgbaria et al.'s (1997) system usage survey, as used in this study, to measure general computer literacy in a sample of nursing or other professional degree students. Therefore, it was impossible to interpret the scores obtained for each dimension of computer literacy in light of this gap in the literature. Previous studies have either measured different dimensions of computer literacy, used different instruments or different variations of computer applications. One large study was found that · examined a sample of over 4,000 undergraduate students to answer questions related to the kinds of computer activities/applications students used and their level of proficiency in using them; however, the author reported means for each activity/application rather than composite scores (Kvavik, 2005). Discussion of Key Findings There were six key findings in this study. First, twenty-seven percent of the students were highly/somewhat techno-ready and 53% were average techno-ready. Second, eighty percent of the students had a positive attitude towards computer use in general (as evidenced by their high computer confidence), ninety percent had a positive attitude towards computer use in nursing, and seventy percent reported moderately low computer proficiency. Third, there was no statistically significant difference in general technology readiness based on age or education.

87

Fourth, technology readiness was statistically significantly associated with both attitude towards computers (in general and in nursing) and perceived ease of computer use in general. Fifth, there was no statistically significant relationship between either dimension of attitude towards computers and general computer literacy. Finally, the findings did not support an association between the students' general technology readiness and their general computer literacy.

Technology Readiness
As previously discussed in Chapter 2, no puqlished studies have explicitly explored nursing students' technology readiness. Therefore, the finding that the first year nursing students in this study were predominantly average techno-ready was compared to the results reported in the nonnursing literature, specifically, the studies conducted by Hendry (2000) and Lai (2008). Hendry's study was comprised of business students. Approximately two-thirds were highly/somewhat techno-ready. Lai investigated professional accountants enrolled in an advanced accounting course; almost 50% of the participants were highly/somewhat technoready. In contrast, only 27% of the nursing students in this study were highly/somewhat technoready. .There were a number of notable differences among the samples that might have contributed to the inconsistent findings. First, in Lai' s (2008) study two thirds of the professional accounting students were studying on a part-time basis; however, all of the nursing students were enrolled as full-time students. This difference suggests that the accounting students might have used technology to a greater extent (possibly in their work environments) than the nursing students-a possibility that is also supported by the fact that the students were preparing for an advanced accounting certification examination. Second, the business students in Hendry's study were also more likely to have used technology to a greater extent than the nursing students based on the findings

88

reported by K vavik (2005). In that study, the researcher examined the extent of education-related technology use among a large sample of undergraduate students (n=>4000) enrolled in diverse professional degree programs. The results indicated that students enrolled in business, engineering and life science reported the highest level of technology use; There is empirical support for an association between general technology readiness and technology use (Chang & Karman, 2006; Hendry, 2000; Liljander et al., 2005; Matthing et al., 2006; Roper, 2006; van der Rhee et al., 2007). Therefore, from this perspective, the study findings are to be expected. Nonetheless, the results were unexpected particularly because of the nursing students' age profile-ninety percent of the sample was :::: 24 years old. This age profile indicates that the majority of the sample would be considered digital natives, a classification that is associated with a greater degree of technological prowess than previous generations. This begs the question: Why was the percentage of highly/somewhat techno-ready students so low? The answer to this question may be, as implied from the previous discussion, related to the nursing students' less frequent use of technology when compared to other university students. Another possible explanation is that the results may be gender-related. The nursing students in this study were predominantly female (97%). Parasuraman and Colby (2001) found genderrelated differences in technology readiness in their sample, which was derived from the general U.S. population-more females (51%) than males (38%) perceived technology as complicated. Ramayah et al. (2003) also reported a statistically significant gender-related difference in technology readiness among the business managers in their sample. However, in that study females were more techno-ready than their male counterparts. This paradoxical finding might have been confounded by the females' level of education. Ninety percent of the participants were college/university graduates and there is some preliminary empirical evidence suggesting a

89

possible association between technology readiness and education (Ramayah et al., 2003). Finally, the students' relatively low technology readiness might be attributed to the instrument that was used to measure this variable (i.e. the Technology Readiness Index [TRI]). As previously stated, the TRI was validated using samples comprised of adults 2: 18 years recruited from the general population in the U.S. Therefore, it is possible that this tool might not have been applicable to the first year nursing students in this study whose conceptualization of technology might have differed from the sample used in its development. Contrary to the study hypotheses, there was no statistically significant difference in first year nursing students' technology readiness based on their age. This finding was both surprising and incongruent with the results of previous research. For example, Parasuraman and Colby (2001) reported an age-related difference in their participants' general technology readiness with younger adults < 30 years old being more techno-ready than those> 65 years. Similarly, Ramayah et al. (2003) reported a statistically significant age-difference in technology readiness in their investigation ofbusiness managers. In that study, managers who were 21-30 years were more techno-ready than managers who were older. The absence of a statistically significant age-related difference in general technology readiness in this study may be attributed to the differences in the age profiles across the samples. Ninety percent of the participants in the present sample were .:::; 24 years old; this was not the case in either of the other two studies. Parasuraman and Colby (200 1) did not provide a detailed age profile of the participants in their study. However, they did indicate that strategies were employed to ensure that the sample was representative of the U.S. population as defined by the available census data. Ramayah et al. 's (2003) sample ranged in age from 21 to 50 years; the youngest participants (14%) were 21-30 years old. Given the greater diversity in these two

90

samples compared to the present study, it is plausible that the nursing students' greater homogeneity limited the study's ability to detect an age-based difference in technology readiness. In addition, although there was no statistically significant difference in general technology readiness based on the students' age, the actual mean scores were higher among the older students particularly when the cut-offwas 21 years. This difference in the group scores suggests that the study might not have had sufficient power to detect the difference. It is also possible that the age limits (i.e. 18 and 21) that were used to divide the groups in this study were too low. The cut-off for the digital age dichotomy in the literature is 1982, implying that a more appropriate dichotomous point might have been age 26 years. This age cut-off would certainly have been closer to the delimiter that Parasuraman and Colby and Ramayah et al. both used (i.e. 30 years). Contrary to the hypothesis, there was also no support for differences in general technology readiness based on level of education. This finding was inconsistent with the results in Ramayah et al. 's (2003) study, which revealed a statistically significant difference in business managers' technology readiness based on education. Those with undergraduate degrees were more technoready than their peers with either high school/college diplomas or graduate degrees. The inconsistencies noted in the study findings may be attributed to the differences in the education profiles in the samples. In this study, 63% of the participants reported that their highest level of education attained was high school, 2% were college graduates and 10% had an undergraduate . degree. In contrast, 58% of the participants in Ramayah et al.'s study had an undergraduate degree, 6% had a graduate degree, 27% were college graduates and 10% had only a high school diploma. As was the case with age, there was greater variability in Ramayah et al. 's sample compared to the sample in this study. This difference might have contributed to the inconsistent

91

results. Additionally, although there was no statistically significant difference detected, the mean scores were much higher among the more educated participants suggesting that the study may have lacked sufficient power to detect this difference.

Attitude Towards Computers
The finding that eighty percent of the students had a positive attitude towards computer use in general (as evidenced by the moderately/extremely high computer confidence reported in this study) was contrary to the results reported by Sinclair and Gardner (1999). Those authors reported that the students in their study had relatively weak computer confidence. These incongruent results may be reflective of an increase in the nursing students' exposure to computers in elementary and high school since Sinclair and Gardner's study was published. This conclusion is corroborated by a more recent study by McDowell and Ma (2007) who reported a dramatic and statistically significant (p < .01) increase in first year nursing students' ownership of computers between 1997 and 2005. In 1997, 60% of the first year nursing students surveyed owned a computer; this rose to 90% in 2003. While the present study did not specifically focus on computer ownership, it was determined that all of the students had access to a computer at home or school, which represents a major shift when compared to previous study findings. The finding that ninety percent of the students had a positive attitude towards computer use in nursing was consistent with the -results reported in previous studies (McBride & Nagle, 1996; Sinclair & Gardner, 1999). However, in the present study, this finding may also be an indication that there was a biased sample comprised primarily of those who were very comfortable with using computers. Viewed collectively, these results indicate that the sample of first year nursing students drawn from a Canadian context had positive attitudes toward computer use in general and in

92

nursing specifically. Marzano (1992) emphasized that attitude is an important precursor to learning. Therefore, this finding may be particularly relevant to nurse educators given the increased emphasis on ICT use in nursing education in Canada.

Computer Literacy
Seventy percent of the first year nursing students in this study perceived themselves as having low computer proficiency even though all of them had previously used email, word processing and the Internet and more than 50% viewed themselves as experts in two of these applications. These findings compared more favourably· with the results of McDowell and Ma's (2007) 8-year longitudinal study in some aspects than it did with other aspects. For example, McDowell and Ma reported that since 2005 nearly all of the first year nursing students reported having a moderate level of competence in these applications. The finding, in the present study, that a large number of students rated themselves as less than competent in the use of bibliographic databases and spreadsheets and as having almost no experience with computerized statistical software applications was also consistent with McDowell and Ma's study. One notable difference in this study was the finding that the majority of the students (56%) rated their level of competency with presentation software as proficient or expert. In contrast, the students in McDowell and Ma's (200?) study consistently reported that they were unable to use presentation software independently. Similar trends were noted among non-nursing students. McEuen (200 1) investigated computer proficiency based on the self-report of a sample of 300 undergraduate students (onethird were freshmen). The data analysis revealed that most students reported the highest skill level (average to expert) for email (90%), word processing (91 %) and the Internet (80%). Much fewer students viewed themselves as average to expert in presentation software, spreadsheets and

93

bibliographic databases. Similarly, Kvavik (2005) reported that 97-99.5% of the 4, 374 undergraduate students (freshmen and seniors enrolled in various professional degree programs) in his study reported that they had previous experience with using the Internet, email and word processing. In addition, on a 4-point Likert scale where 1=very unskilled and 4=very skilled, the mean for each of these three application ranged from 3.47-3.60 implying that the students believed that they had a high level of skill in using these programs. In contrast, the students ranked themselves lower on presentation software (M=2.90) and spreadsheets (2.86) and the freshmen perceived that they were less skilled than the seniors in these applications. A plausible explanation for the first year nursing students' low computer proficiency is that, in general, although computer use is currently more prevalent in elementary and high school than in previous years, students are primarily being educated in basic computer skills. Thus, their limited knowledge enables them to use the technology for communicating electronically, researching information on the Internet and typing documents. Kvavik's (2005) comment summarizes the situation succinctly: "students are skilled with basic office suite applications but tend to know just enough technology functionality to accomplish their work; they have less indepth application knowledge or problem-solving skills" (pp. 7.5-7 .6).

Technology Readiness, Perceived Ease of Computer Use and Attitude Towards Computers
As hypothesized, general technology readiness was statistically significantly correlated with perceived ease of computer use in general and each dimension of attitude towards computers. No published studies have investigated these relationships in the population of interest in this study. Therefore, the study results were compared to the research findings in other disciplines. The correlation between technology readiness and attitude towards computer

94

use in general was consistent with the results of the study by Liljander, Gillberg, Gummerus and van Riel (2005). Those authors found a statistically significant relationship between consumers' technology readiness and their attitude towards using the Internet (r=0.51;p=O.Ol) for airline check-in. The correlation between technology readiness and perceived ease of computer use was also consistent with other consumer research findings. For example, Walczuch, Lemmink & Streukens (2007) found statistically significant relationships (ranging from r= -.13;p=.05 to r=0.27; p=0.05) between each of the four technology readiness elements and perceived ease of technology use in a study that investigated the effect of employees' general technology readiness on technology acceptance. Similarly, Lin et al. (2007) reported a statistically significant relationship between technology readiness and perceived ease of technology use (p <0.01) in the context of consumer adoption of e-service systems. Finally, Davis (1993) established empirical associations between perceived ease of use and attitude towards using computers (0.13;p < .05). In the present study, general technology readiness was statistically significantly and strongly related to perceived ease of computer use and attitude towards computer use in general. These relationships suggest that students having a propensity to embrace and use technology, in general, might be more likely to have a positive attitude towards computer use in general and perceive the technology as easy to use. The findings imply that the opposite might also hold true. Therefore, in academic settings, general technology readiness might be an important factor in understanding students' responses to ICT use.

Attitude Towards Computers and Computer Proficiency
Contrary to the hypothesis, this study did not find a statistically significant relationship between either dimension of attitude towards computers and general computer proficiency at the .01 level of significance. Positive relationships (r=.35; p=.05 and r=.39; p=.05) were found

95

between attitude towards computer use in general and computer proficiency with the scores that were derived from the seven applications with percent distributions> 50% but not with the scores that were derived from all ten applications. Therefore, this finding is suggestive of a correlation between these two variables that may be uncovered in a subsequent study with a larger sample size or less stringent level of significance. This study finding was also inconsistent with the results of previous studies. Davis (1989) established empirical associations between the TAM's affective and behavioural dimensions (p<.05). Levine and Donitsa-Schmidt (1998) reported statistically significant relationships between computer confidence (i.e. attitude to computer use in general) and general computer literacy described as computer use at home (r=.29, p<.01) and computer use at school (r=.23; p<.01) in that study. Similarly, Al-Khaldi and Al-Jabri (1998) reported a positive and statistically significant correlation between university students' computer confidence and their self-reported computer proficiency in various computer applications (r=.48; p<.05). It is possible that the low computer proficiency scores in this study might have contributed to this unexpected result. This conclusion seems plausible given that the correlation between attitude towards computer use in general and computer proficiency was statistically significant at the p = .05 level with the scores that were derived from the seven applications with percent distributions > 50% but not with the scores that were derived from all ten applications.
Technology Readiness and Computer Proficiency

There was also no statistically significant relationship between general computer proficiency and general technology readiness in this study. No other studies were found in the empirical literature that investigated this relationship. The results of this study suggest that the relationship between technology readiness and computer proficiency might not be direct. This is

96

possible considering that the theory of reasoned action postulates that intention to use is a determinant of actual use (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980). This explanation is further supported by the results of previous studies, which reported positive and statistically significant correlations between technology readiness and intentions to use (Lin, Shih & Sher, 2007; Ramayah et al. 2003). For example, Lin et al. (2007) found positive and statistically significant correlations between technology readiness and consumers' intentions to use online stock trading systems (r=0.64; p < 0.01 ). Likewise, Ramayah et al. reported a statistically significant and positive relationship between technology readiness and business managers' intentions to use a web-based system (r=0.38,p <0.01). The absence of a statistically significant correlation between general computer literacy and general technology readiness implies that a person with a high degree of technology readiness might not have a high degree of computer proficiency. This explanation seems reasonable in light of the finding that although 80% of the sample reported varying degrees of technoreadiness, 70% rated their computer proficiency as low. This finding may be attributed to the differences in conceptualization between technology readiness and computer literacy. More specifically, technology readiness is a global concept that refers to a person's propensity to embrace and use technology in a general sense whereas computer proficiency refers to the ability to use specific the software applications developed for a specific type of technology.

Summary
This chapter discussed the results of the study. More specifically, the chapter discussed the representativeness of the sample; the results of the exploratory data analysis and the key findings. Although the proportion of females and the mean age of the sample did not exactly match the provincial or national profile, the differences were not considered substantial.

97

No published studies have investigated the phenomena of interest in a sample of Canadian first year nursing students. Therefore, the results of the exploratory data analysis were compared with studies involving other nursing or non-nursing students where possible. In some cases, the results of the present research were comparable; in others, it was difficult to interpret the study findings based on the results observed in previous research. To summarize, the key study findings were: 1) twenty-seven percent of the students were highly/somewhat techno-ready and fifty-three percent were average techno-ready, 2) eighty percent of the students had a positive attitude towards computer use in general (as evidenced by their high computer confidence), ninety percent had a positive attitude towards computer use in nursing, 3) seventy percent reported moderately low proficiency in using various computer applications, 4) there was no statistically significant difference in general technology readiness based on age or education, 5) general technology readiness was statistically significantly correlated to each dimension of attitude towards computers and perceived ease of computer use, and 6) general computer literacy was not statistically significantly related to either dimension of attitude towards computers or general technology readiness.

CHAPTER 7: SUMMARY, IMPLICATIONS & CONCLUSION
Summary
In Canada, the current technological revolution in the health care industry brings with it demands and expectations for nursing students to gain competency in various computerized and health care specific technologies. There is empirical evidence suggesting that some first year nursing students in the U.S. may not have a high degree of technology readiness and less than ideal computer literacy. Yet, there is a paucity of information about the technology readiness, attitude towards computers or computer literacy of Canadian nursing students, particularly first year nursing students. This study used a descriptive correlational design to begin to address this gap in the literature. The objectives were to: 1) examine first year nursing students' general technology r~adiness, attitude towards computer use (in general and in nursing) and general computer literacy within a Canadian context; 2) investigate the relationships that exist between the students' general technology readiness and selected correlates-age, and level of education; and 3) explore the associations that exist among these key study variables. A convenience sample of 30 first year nursing students was recruited from one site of a 4year Collaborative Nursing Degree Program in Canada. Standardized instruments measured the study variables. The Technology Readiness Index measured the students' general technology readiness. The Computer Confidence and Nurses' Computer Attitude Inventory scales measured their attitude towards computer use in general and in nursing specifically. The Computer

Literacy Assessment Scale measured the participants' general computer literacy. A researcherdesigned questionnaire was used to collect pertinent demographic data. Statistical analyses were conducted to: 1) describe the students' general technology readiness, each dimension of attitude towards computers and general computer literacy; 2)

99

examine correlates of general technology readiness; and 3) investigate the relationships among these study variables. The results of these analyses demonstrated that the sample was primarily comprised of females (97%) who were 21 years or younger (76%). A large percentage (37%) was Caucasian. The majority (77%) rated their ICT experience as average and most (87%) had no previous health care experience. Twenty-seven percent of the participants were classified as high/somewhat techno-ready. Fifty-three percent were considered average techno-ready and the remaining twenty percent demonstrated varying degrees of techno-resistance. The vast majority of the students had positive attitudes towards computer use in general (90%) and positive attitudes towards computer use in general nursing (80% ). A large percentage (87%) of the students used a computer several times each day and 40% spent in excess of two-hours on the computer on a daily basis. All of the students had previously used email, word processing software and the Internet. Very few students had any previous experience with health care applications. Seventy percent rated themselves as having moderately low proficiency in using various computer applications and 30% perceived that they had moderately high proficiency. There was no statistically significant difference in general technology readiness based on age or education. Technology readiness (in general) was statistically significantly correlated to each dimension of attitude towards computers and perceived ease of general computer use. Finally, general computer literacy (specifically, computer proficiency) was not statistically significantly associated with either dimension of attitude towards computers or general technology readiness.

Study Limitations There are a number of limitations inherent in the study. First, the sample size was smaller than that required to achieve 80% statistical power, as determined by the power analysis. Thus, there was likely inadequate power to detect some differences and/or relationships within the sample. Second, there was a low response rate, which was possibly attributable to a number of design factors. For example, the study lacked any direct benefit for the participants. Bums and Grove (2005) asserted that participants might be more apt to volunteer for a study if they perceive a personal benefit. In retrospect, the study design might have included some incentive for the students to participate such as a draw for a gift certificate to the movies or one that could be spent at one of the local malls. The length of the questionnaires and the time commitment of 15-20 minutes might also have influenced the low response rate. First year nursing students at the participating site were enrolled in seven courses concurrently. Therefore, the study requirements may have conflicted with other academic demands. Third, only one of the research instruments (the NCATT) was designed for and validated in a nursing context. Therefore, it is possible that the instruments may not have fully captured the essence of the constructs of interest from a nursing perspective. For this reason, the study findings need to be interpreted with caution. Fourth, the study has potential threats to external validity due to the convenience sampling method that was used. Participation was voluntary which increased the possibility of selfselection and a biased sample comprised of those who were more comfortable with and experienced in using technology. In addition, all of the participants reported that they used a computer or laptop at home or at work. The empirical literature suggests that some ethnic groups might have less access to computers than others (Williamson et al., 2006). Therefore,

101

given that almost 40% of the participants were Caucasian, it is plausible that a more ethnically diverse sample might have yielded different results. A fifth limitation of this research design was the uncontrolled setting, which had the potential to increase the risk of random errors resulting from environmental distractions such as background noises. However, this design was required to maximize participants' anonymity; although, it is conceivable that some participants might have chosen to complete the research instruments as a group. Finally, the reliance on self-report questionnaires was a limitation that assumed that participants would respond honestly to the individual items on the research instruments. The use of observation as a measurement approach might have eradicated this shortcoming. Implications In spite of these limitations, the study is among the first to begin to address first year nursing students' technology readiness, attitude towards computers and computer literacy. Therefore, it provides some preliminary evidence with implications for nursing practice and education, theory and research.
Implications for Practice and Education

The findings suggest that first year nursing students might have varying degrees of technology readiness and proficiency in using different computer applications. Thus, these results suggest the need for nurse educators and administrators to revisit the notion of 'one-size fits all' when contemplating course design and delivery. For decades, researchers have suggested that some first year nursing students may have lower computer literacy than educators presupposed and therefore may be disadvantaged in a technology-oriented learning environment. Some nursing scholars have called for students' computer literacy to be assessed, rather than
102

assumed. Prior to this study, very little was known about the technology readiness, attitude towards computers or computer literacy of Canadian first year nursing students. The study findings support earlier research that first year nursing students may, in some cases, not be as proficient in the use of computer applications as educators may think. The study results also imply that first year nursing students may need additional supports to enhance their learning experience given the increased emphasis on information and communication technology (ICT) use in nursing. Lawrence's (2005) Framework for Student Engagement and Mastery provides strategies that nurse educators and administrators might find useful in facilitating students' successful transition to postsecondary education. The Framework proposes that nursing faculty and administration might consider providing supportive learning environments that recognize the learners' diversity and actively seek to engage the students. To that end, an important first step would be to recognize that first year nursing students have varying degrees of technology readiness and computer proficiency. Recognition of these differences might stimulate curriculum planning activities aimed at integrating innovative approaches to support individual student needs arising from low technoreadiness/computer proficiency in order to promote academic success and improve retention. Strategies that may be considered beneficial include the implementation of a standardized screening tool that could be used to evaluate first year nursing students' technology readiness and computer proficiency. Students with low scores could be streamlined into specially designed ICT classes that could be completed before beginning the nursing program. Similar strategies have been incorporated into other professional degree programs (Wall ace & Clariana; 2005). In addition, the literature indicates that measures of student engagement consistently show that 'digital natives' value community and experiential learning (Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005).

103

Therefore, according to Oblinger and Oblinger, they learn best in learning environments that provide practical "hands-on" experience and support peer-to-peer interactions such as small group work or team projects. Lawrence (2005) also suggested the use of online discussion groups, study groups and peer mentors. Nurse scholars have also proposed a variety of best educational practices that could be incorporated in curriculum planning activities aimed at enhancing students' technology readiness and computer proficiency (Barnard, Nash & O'Brien, 2005; Carty & Rosenfeld, 1998; Elfrink et al., 2000). Many of these best educational practices build on the assumption that the interprofessional teamwork that "is customary in the health care system needs to be replicated within educational institutions. For example, Barnard et al. suggested that a strategic partnership might be established between nurse educators, information specialists and curriculum developers to better utilize the expertise within educational institutions. Similarly, Elfrink et al. asserted that nurse educators might consider partnering with information technology personnel to team-teach information technology content from a nursing perspective. Using this collaborative approach, these interprofessional teams might facilitate the development of various nursing-oriented computer-based multimedia and interactive programs. Such programs could be incorporated into different courses to actively engage students through problem-based learning activities aimed at enhancing their technology readiness and computer proficiency. According to Carty and Rosenfeld, collaborative approaches such as those previously discussed might enable both students and faculty and to learn with, and from, those viewed as information and technology experts. Thus, this strategy might also enhance faculty's technology readiness by increasing their knowledge and confidence in the area.

104

Finally, these research findings accentuate the need to explicitly delineate ICT competencies for nursing students t~ facilitate a shared understanding of the cognitive and technical abilities required for nurses to succeed in today's technology-rich health care ·environment (Hobbs, 2002). A much clearer delineation of these competencies by the Canadian Nurses' Association as well as provincial nursing regulatory bodies might lead to greater consistency in the conceptualization of nursing computer literacy in the literature and possibly result in greater standardization in the way the concept is operationalized in nursing research.

Implications for Theory
This study is among the first to integrate the technology readiness construct within the TAM and use this revised framework in a nursing context. Therefore, this conceptual linkage provides a new perspective from which to examine phenomena of interest to nursing. Parasuraman (2000) suggested several avenues for scholarly research that focus on conceptual models in which technology readiness is a core construct and which increase knowledge about the correlates of technology readiness. This study followed through on these recommendations by integrating technology readiness within the TAM and examining two possible correlates-age and education. On the basis of the empirical literature emphasizing the age-related digital dichotomy in the general population, the study framework hypothesized that there would be an age-related difference in first year nursing students' general technology readiness. This hypothesis was not supported in the current study potentially because of the limited variability in the participants' age resulting in a sample of predominantly (90%) 'digital natives'. It was also hypothesized that there would be an education-related difference in the students' general technology readiness on the basis of previous research. This hypothesis was also not supported in this study likely due to

105

the relatively homogeneous sample. Therefore, the question remains: Is there an age- and/or education-related difference in first year nursing students' technology readiness? The study framework also hypothesized that technology readiness was conceptually related to the existing cognitive and affective responses in the TAM. The study framework thus proposed associations among technology readiness, attitude towards computers and perceived ease of use. These hypotheses were supported in the study suggesting that technology readiness is conceptually related to the cognitive and affective responses in the TAM. Empirical support for these interrelationships is important because it serves to connect the more global concept of technology with a specific type of technology such as the computer; thereby, increasing avenues for future research aimed at describing, explaining or predicting relevant phenomena of interest. In addition, incorporating the technology readiness construct within the TAM broadens its applicability enabling researchers to explore the potential impact of a variety of individual characteristics on technology readiness and technology use behaviour. Also, it may be beneficial to incorporate the technology readiness dimensions to expand its capacity to investigate relationships between various correlates and each of these dimensions. Finally, it was hypothesized that an association might exist between general technology readiness and general computer literacy. This hypothesis was not supported suggesting that technology readiness might not be directly related to computer literacy. Previous studies have provided some empirical support for a correlation between technology readiness and intention to use, which implies that consideration should be given to modify the TAM even further by incorporating intention to use as a mediating variable between technology readiness and computer literacy.

106

Implications for Research
As a construct, technology readiness has been investigated within the general population and among some university students. However, this concept has been understudied in a nursing context. The study findings provide some preliminary evidence in support of the need for further research to explore, explain or predict technology readiness, attitude towards computers and computer literacy among different types of nursing students and/or among nurses in diverse practice settings. For example, there remains a need for research to explore the possibility of an age- and or education-related difference in students' technology readiness. Although there was no statistically significant difference in technology readiness based on the students' age and education, the actual mean scores were much higher among the older (particularly when the cutoff was 21 years) and more educated students. These differences suggest that future research may be warranted to further explore these relationships. A larger, more diverse sample is needed to provide a clearer picture and to answer this question. One possible strategy to increase the variability of the sample in future studies would be to recruit participants from multiple sites. Another strategy might be to use mixed samples comprised of different classifications of first year nursing students such as those enrolled in generic, second degree entry, internationally educated and post-registered nurse baccalaureate degree programs. Further insight from research using a mixed sample might provide evidence on which to base policies to better support incoming nurses in both undergraduate and graduate degree programs, particularly if they have been away from academic settings for some time. Additionally, future research could explore other possible correlates of technology readiness such as ethnicity, language or socio-economic status. There is also a need for validated instruments to measure technology readiness among different categories of nursing students such as graduate versus undergraduate students.

107

The literature also highlights concerns about nurses' resistance to computerized technology in clinical settings (Jayasuriya & Caputi, 1996). Many implementations of clinical information systems have failed on account of this resistance from front line nurses (Jayasuriya & Caputi, 1996). Yet, there is a paucity of studies examining the technology readiness of staff nurses, a large percentage of whom have had limited exposure to computerized technology. Therefore, this represents another understudied area in nursing in which future research may help to inform decision-making to increase the prevalence of successful implementations of clinical information systems. Two-thirds of the students in this study reported that they had taken some formal computer course, primarily in high school. Given the finding of overall low computer proficiency, future studies might explore the nature of first year nursing students' previous computer training. Other potentially fruitful areas for nursing knowledge development are the construction and validation of research instruments to measure computer literacy from a nursing perspective. In addition, this study investigated technology readiness and students' attitudes towards the computer as one particular type of technology. Future studies might examine nursing students' or nurses' attitudes toward other types of technology such as personal digital assistants, e-textbooks or other specific health care technologies including electronic documentation systems. Finally, the literature suggests that faculty's propensity to embrace and adopt ICT might play a role in enhancing students' ICT use (Nagle & Clarke, 2004). However, very few published studies have explored faculty's technology readiness, attitude towards computers or computer literacy in either a nursing or a Canadian context. Thus, the paucity of research in this area accentuates the need for further studies to increase understanding of this phenomenon.

108

CONCLUSION
This study explored first year nursing students' general technology readiness, attitude towards computer use (in general and in nursing) and computer literacy in a Canadian context. A secondary aim was to examine the associations among these variables. No published studies have explored these relationships in this context. This study was also among the first to use a modification of the TAM that incorporates technology readiness, as its theoretical framework. The study findings support a number of propositions advanced by this modified theoretical framework specifically pertaining to the associations among technology readiness, attitude towards computers and perceived ease of use. The study findings suggest that Canadian first year nursing students may have positive attitudes towards computer use in general and in nursing but they may require support to increase their technology readiness and proficiency in using various computer applications.
