ABSTRACT
Architecture has traditionally served as a tool with which to support human occupation of the built environment. This approach however, neglects the ways in which the environment conversely affects human behavior and experience. Through the exploration of this reciprocal relationship, the thesis will attempt to engage in an architecture of the lived world. Place, a prominent premise of this lived world, is dependent on the relations between social and spatial components. In order for a community to operate successfully, it must facilitate the interactions of these components, operating as a socio-spatial network. The findings of this design research will be manifested through an intervention in a local community where the physical environment has contributed to its decline.

1: INTRODUCTION

xxvi

The basis for this thesis is derived from the understanding that there exists a symbiotic human-environment relationship which is often neglected in the design of the physical environment. Studies in environmental psychology have substantiated this relationship and its effects on the individual and community. From this interrelationship emerges the concept of place, a socio-spatial assemblage rooted in experience and identity. Like all assemblages, the significance lies not in the individual social and spatial components, but in the interactions between them and the consequent identity of the place. With the intent of developing architectural strategies that can be manifested on a specific site, this thesis will also investigate social capital and the network of social relations that are imperative to community as place. 01

1.1 People and their Environments

Environmental psychology is the "study of the symbiotic relationships between humans and their environments" (Kopec xv). This refers to an interrelationship between individuals and their environments, whereby the "environment influences and constrains behavior, but behavior also leads to changes in the environment" (Bell et al 7). By studying cognition and perception within environment, studies in the field have discovered this relationship as well as ways in which the findings should be incorporated in the design of our environments.     By influencing the beneficial secretion and absorption of neurochemicals  through environmental characteristics, design can positively affect the  physical and psychological health and well-being of an environment's  occupants and users. (Kopec xv) Environmental psychology is an amalgamation of the fundamental aspects of biology, social science and design practices in an attempt to support human occupation of the built environment. As humans, our behaviors derive from a complex blend of sources including social situation and the physical environment. Yet most design today gives little consideration to its effect on the user, resulting in issues pertaining to comfort, privacy, crowding and anxiety. Understanding the factors that influence human behaviour within the environment are a key to successful design of spaces for people.

1.1.1 Personal Space and Privacy

Personal space can be understood as an invisible, portable and flexible territory regulating how closely individuals interact. It functions primarily for protection and communication and is a learned behavior. Personal space requirements vary depending on situational variables including cultural and societal norms, personality and the physical environment. Edward Hall developed the concept of proxemics and defined four basic interpersonal distance zones: intimate (0 to 18 inches), personal (18 inches to 4 feet), social (4 to 12 feet), and public (12 to 25 feet) (Kopec 67). Invasion of personal space, as well as being forced to interact with other individuals under inappropriate personal space will make people uncomfortable and can lead to anxiety. (Bell et al. 5). Large open public spaces can contribute to these feelings and designers can negate this effect by breaking them into smaller spaces either physically or visually.

Intimate 0 - 18"

Personal 18" - 4"

Social 4' - 12'

Public 12' - 25'

Figure 1.02: Proxemics

Privacy is an interpersonal boundary process by which people control their interactions with others. Just as with personal space, privacy needs vary according to social and environmental situations. The four aspects of privacy are solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve (Kopec 69). Solitude is the state of being alone among others such as the state one seeks in a library. Intimacy is group privacy and emotional bonds such as lovers who want to be alone together (Canter and Craik 5). Anonymity is the yearn to be invisible or unnoticed by others while reserve is the distance individuals create between themselves and others by building psychological barriers in public or private (Kopec 69). Designers must understand the privacy needs of the user in order to design appropriate spaces. In larger projects with diverse users, awareness of general privacy needs as well as the effects environment will have on perceptions of safety and privacy are integral to a strong design.

Crowding refers to the feeling people have when physically constrained because there are too many people in a given space. Too many people, too little space or both are causes of the psychological state. The constituents of crowding are the situation, the emotion or affect, and the behavior produced by the emotion (Kopec 71). Both social and environmental factors compose the situation and it is important to note that the perceived level of density, not the actual level of density, is responsible for the resultant behavior. Crowding essentially occurs when an individual feels their personal space is invaded, and they have lost control of their privacy. Designers can mitigate crowding and its consequences through a number of strategies ranging from furniture arrangement to building size. Increasing ceiling height, dividing expansive rooms into smaller spaces, and increasing brightness and daylight can all alleviate crowding. Low-rise buildings tend to lessen perceived crowding compared to highrises which are "associated with greater feelings of crowdedness and less perceived control, safety, privacy, and satisfaction with relations with other residents" (Bell et al. 8).

In her research paper, Healthy Architecture! Can environments evoke emotional responses? Kirsten Roessler seeks to answer this question by visiting three unique environments and assessing the influence on the individual's emotions and perceptions. Visiting Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany, she notes that while there is a transparency and ambiguity in structure, there are no opportunities to withdraw and experience a sense of safety. Furthermore, despite its long and rich history, the square is void of any reference to this past. Throughout its history, Potsdamer Platz has shifted from being the thriving heart of Berlin to a dividing, desolate barrier. During the Cold War, the Berlin Wall physically divided East and West Germany, the apogee of its existence as a barrier (see figure 1). After the fall of the Wall, the square suddenly had an opportunity to connect the city once again both physically and symbolically (Miller and Reed 2-3). However, due in part to the division of the square into four parts, Potsdamer Platz now evokes a rather ominous sense of presence. If judged strictly in terms of the number of individuals who traverse the space daily, it can be deemed an overwhelming success. Yet within its colossal confines, there seems to be no place to "withdraw and experience a sense of safety" (Roessler 84). Potsdamer Platz beckons notions of past separation and offers no refuge. It can be analysed as a place that generates existential isolation, where a lack of privacy and security are caused by vast glass frontages, high towers, large open space, and excessive use of neon light (Roessler 86).

1.1.2 Community Space Community is not just a reference to a location, but to a cognitive and emotional state (Bell et al. 2). Community can be as much a feeling as an environment. Physical design affects social relationships within communities in that it affects proximity. For example, more opportunities for meeting other members results in increased opportunities for social interaction and friendship. Conversely, design can also create physical barriers, separating communities and creating further social distance as a result. Sense of community is a form of place attachment that is based on the sharing and commonality of space, attitude, and behavior (Kopec 297). As such, community spaces should be designed as shared elements that can facilitate social interaction and relationships. From public squares to streets, the human scale must be at the forefront of the design. European medieval and renaissance cities such as Venice, Italy and Copenhagen, Denmark were originally established as pedestrian cities and have managed to preserve this character whilst also adapting to the modern world. With the 20th century came the rise of the automobile and the subsequent conversion of cities to accommodate them. Cities began to fill all vacant space with moving and parked vehicles in an attempt to alleviate the growing traffic volumes. However, over time planners have realized that an increase in roads and parking structures correlates to an increase in traffic and volume. Building more roads is a direct invitation for people to purchase and drive more cars (Gehl 9). This direct link between invitation and patterns of use can be translated to pedestrian activity in the city. From the early 1960's, the city of Copenhagen began to significantly reduce vehicular traffic and parking in the city center. The historic main street, Strøget was the first to be converted in 1962. Since then, many other streets have been converted along with parking lots transformed into public squares. Over this period, studies have observed unanticipated changes in city life and major increases in pedestrian traffic. More people are walking and staying in the city. Similarly, through the simultaneous increase and improvement of cycling conditions on its streets, a new bicycle culture has emerged and become synonymous with the culture of the city. From the Copenhagen case study, Gehl concluded that inviting people instead of cars to the city will result in increased pedestrian traffic and activity (Gehl 13). 09

Figure 1.07: Five Elements of Legibility

While these pedestrian friendly streets and paths contribute to the image and experience of their respective cities, they are only one of [five] elements which do so. In his book The Image of the City, urban planner Kevin Lynch concluded that there are five basic recurring elements that project the formal image of a city. Based on studies conducted in three American cities on public and group image, the results are rooted in physical form and organized into five types of environmental elements. Known as the five elements of legibility, they are: Paths, Edges, Districts, Nodes and Landmarks, and serve as standardized principles for urban design. 10

Paths: Continuous and highly recognizable channels of movement such as streets, transit lines, walkways and railroads. Paths serve as circulation routes, allowing people to observe the city or space as they move through it. Those with definite beginnings and destinations help tie the community together and enhance users' sense of orientation when intersected. The other elements are situated along and interconnected with these paths. Edges: linear breaks in continuity serving as boundaries, borders and paths, such as walls, shorelines, and railroads. Edges can operate as seams where two adjacent areas are interconnected. They can also act as physical barriers, secluding a space from another. Edges are valuable organizing features, defining particular areas within a city [or the outline of a city itself]. Districts: regions with a common and definite character recognizable from both within, and without. They are neighborhoods defined physically by components such as "texture, space, form, detail, symbol, building type, use, activity, inhabitants, [upkeep], topography" (Lynch 67). As one enters a district there is an awareness of being `inside of' [citation?] due to "some common, identifying character". Districts also contain the other four elements which strengthen its identity and provide structure. Nodes: hubs or strategic anchor sites where people can enter and gather. They are focal points in which people specifically travel to and from. These include junctions or a confluence of paths such as transit stations, traffic intersections, airports. As well, they can be areas of concentration, the focal point of a district known as a core. Nodes can also exist simultaneously as both junctions and cores. Landmarks: highly visible geographic attractions serving as reference points for orientation and popular destinations. Unlike nodes, they usually can not and need not be entered and stand as external physical objects. They include buildings, mountains, stores, tall towers, and lighthouses, as well as local landmarks such as trees, store fronts and water towers. Landmarks symbolize a constant direction and are [used] by isolating the single element from its surroundings. (Lynch 46-90) 11

Figure 1.08: Range of Activities a: Necessary Activities b: Optional Activities c: (Right) Social Activities

As previously noted, Lynch's five elements deal with the role of the physical form in creating the image of a city. While his resultant elements are legitimate and relevant, they lack in part other influences of imageabiltity including social connotation, function and the activities which occur in a space. The range of activities that occur in a given city space are as equally integral to imageability as the physical condition. This range can be categorized into three main activity types: necessary activities, optional activities, and social activities (Gehl 20). Necessary activities occur under all circumstances, regardless of climate, and are those which people must carry out. They are often daily actions such as commuting and grocery shopping and are enacted almost subconsciously. Optional Activities are more leisurely or recreational including stopping to enjoy city views, eating lunch outside or strolling down a promenade. These actions are elective, and as such are increasingly likely to occur as outdoor conditions improve.

12

c

This extent of activities is inherently linked to Lynch's physical basis of his five elements. The planning and design of outdoor spaces can directly influence the range and type of activities that will take place there. Optional activities can be encouraged by providing users with notions of "protection, security, reasonable space, furniture and visual quality" (Gehl 21). The amount of optional activities in a public city space is directly correlated to the outdoor quality. When city life is promoted through design, the possibility and strength of social activities is considerably increased. Social activities require some form of communication between people in city space. When public spaces are empty and unused, there can not be social activities. These activities range from see and hear contacts like simply watching people in a space, to more active interactions including brief encounters and the formation of acquaintances to pre-arranged activities like meetings, markets and festivals. The significance of social activities lies in the emphasis of activity and life as an urban attraction. Humans seek the presence of other people and accordingly congregate where activities are taking place (Gehl 23). 13

1.2 Place
The strongest communities are ones which embody the notion of place. Place is differentiated from space through an inherent intensity that connects sociality to spatiality in everyday life. Place is not bound by physical dimensions, rather it is enabled by the intensity of connection and association that a person and place hold for each other (Dovey 3). Edward Relph described sense of place as being associated with a persistent identity made up of three components: "the place's physical setting; it's activities, situations, and events; and the individual and group meanings created through people's experiences and intentions in regard to that place" (Seamon and Sowers 47). This thesis seeks to push this notion further, investigating not only the components but the relations between them. Identity with place, which Relph defines through the concept of insideness, is the root of this lived intensity. 1.2.1 Space and Place Space and place are primary components of the human lived world, taken for granted within everyday life. Space is not simply a void or container which houses places. Relph deduced that space provides the context for places but derives its meaning from particular places. In order to achieve a more experiential understanding of place, space must also be studied in terms of how people experience it (Relph 9). Relph identified different types of spaces which contribute to a phenomenological understanding of place. Some of these spaces, including primitive space, perceptual space and existential space are immediate, instinctive and physical. Conversely he distinguishes spatial experiences that are intangible, spiritual and abstract such as architectural space, cognitive space and abstract space (Seamon and Sowers 44). Like space, place also has a multiplicity of interrelated meanings and is not a fixed sense of experience across all situations. It is heterogeneous and has a large range of nuances

14

with many different lived dimensions. While the relationship between the two is integral, as previously mentioned, place is distinguished from space. In literature however this is often not the case. Place theory first emerged as `topos' in early Greek philosophy as an ontological concept. It was perceived as a "form of ontological ground, a view of place that is inseparable from being or existence ­ to exist is to exist in a place" (Dovey 4). Western philosophy generally repressed this notion of place, adopting the idea of place as an abstract site within spatial coordinates. This view limited place to mere location without any notion of experience, leading to the emergence of space as the dominant and conceptual context while place became overlooked. With his ontological theory of being-in-the-world, Heidegger revived the conception of ontology of place. However, while still relevant, both of these notions of place, as ontological ground and as pure site, lack the concept of experience or sense of place in everyday life (Dovey 4). The issue with a strictly ontological view of place is the essentialist interpretation that may accompany it. Referred to as the `genius loci' or spirit of place, here sense of place is regarded as fixed and implanted in history and homeland. This is akin to Heidegger's view of place as "primordial ground of being" and often meshes the sense and the ontology of place, disregarding the social constructions of place identity (Dovey 5). However, while Hiedegger ties place to ontology, this does not indicate that phenomenology must be severed from it. As such, this thesis is not suggesting that place should be separated from ontology, for this would rob place of social theory and its potential to create ostensibly naturalized identity. Ultimately place is dependent on the relation between spatiality and sociality. It is an inextricably interwoven knot of the two for "while space is socially constructed, the social is spatially constructed" (qtd. in Dovey 6). In order to further explore this fluid, unfixed understanding of place, Dovey replaces the Heideggerian ontology of being-in-the-world with a more Deleuzian concept of becoming-in-the-world, still preserving a phenomenological ontology of place.

1.2.2 Identity of Place Identity is a fundamental aspect in everyday life and plays a prominent role in understanding and creating place. Lynch defined the identity of place through the meaning of individuality, acknowledging only the distinction from other places (Lynch 8). Relph furthers this definition through in depth analysis of both the identity of a place and the identity that a group or individual has with said place. The human-environment relationship is both a cognitive and visceral experience. Place emerges once a space feels utterly familiar, for places are "significant centres of our immediate experiences of the world" (Relph 43). According to Relph, identity of place is a result of intentions and experiences as well as the physical appearances of buildings and site. It also refers to both the distinctiveness of individual places and the sameness between different places (Relph 44). Every place bears both a persistent sameness which differentiates it from other places and a persistent sharing of characteristic(s) with others. As such, Relph deduced that identity is established both in the individual and the greater culture. It is dynamic and circumstantial, and contains various elements and forms (Relph 45). One's home is identified as such despite physical modifications and social transitions over time. While siblings may move out and walls are repainted or knocked down over time, there remains a persistent sameness about it. The components and circumstances of the home have changed, thus altering the makeup of its image. Nevertheless, it maintains its comprehensive identity as `home' through a steadfast sameness, be it the form, smell, affinity and so on. This persistence in identity is due in part to its gradual formation over time by the user. As has been established above, knowing a place requires more than just an understanding of its visual and physical qualities. The "feel" of a place takes time to acquire for it is composed of recurring experiences, activities and events occurring over months and years (Tuan 183). This is one reason why the aforementioned changes to one's home simply expand its identity as home, as opposed to resulting in a loss of such identity. Identity of place is ultimately determined through the manifestation of qualities, objects and experiences of the place. The three basic components of the identity of places observed by Relph are: the static physical setting, the activities, and the individual and group meanings formed through experiences. These three elements are inherently entwined in our experiences of place. For the significance is not the individual components, rather the interrelated series of dialectics they form, which wholly comprise the identity of the place (Relph 47-48). Identity of place is not merely the sum of its components, but a socially 16

Figure 1.09: Place as Assemblage

structured assemblage which varies with experience. While a park is composed of the swings, jungle gym, trees, people, sidewalks, benches and so on, it is the connections between them that makes it an assemblage or place. The reciprocity amongst these parts: children on the playground, circulation of people and wildlife throughout the park, the connections to the neighborhood and city, all form the persistent sameness that make it a park and distinguish it from other places (Dovey 16). As such, for every place there exists multiple identities based upon individual experiences and perceptions. These inevitably combine to form a [dynamic], common identity or public image of the place. Place as assemblage remains dynamic, and irreducible to its individual components, as the removal and addition of elements simply contributes to the interrelated dialects that form its identity (Dovey 16). This thesis employs this approach to place as a dynamic assemblage defined by the connections and interactions of components. 17

Figure 1.10: Immigrants and Social Networks a: Immigrants and `Outsideness'

18

1.2.3 Identity with Place Relph defined identity with place through the concept of insideness, which is "the degree of attachment, involvement, and concern for a place by an individual or group" (Seamon and Sowers 47). When a person feels inside a place, they feel safe, enclosed, at ease and a sense of belonging. This feeling creates a stronger identity with the place. Conversely, outsideness refers to an extraneous experience of place where one is separated and unfamiliar with the place. This basic dualism is intrinsic to our experiences of place and the understanding of the different levels of intensity with which we do so (Relph 49). In neighborhoods comprised largely by minorities and immigrants, the feeling of `outsideness' can lead to rifts between social groups. These groups may feel disconnected from the community and as a result are unable to associate with the sense of place. In these situations, while place exists for some, most of the community may feel alienated from it. The resultant multiple identities persist as a source of conflict in such divided communities (Dovey 5). While a single architectural intervention cannot impose one community identity, design can promote interactions and relations that link the identities of the community into one place by addressing the multiplicity of parts. An intervention that embodies sense of place as an everyday experience versus the primordial ontology of "genius loci" holds the capacity to achieve this.

19

1.3 Social Capital

For the assemblage neighborhood to operate successfully, it has been established that the components within must interact and form the social structure. One important set of inner networks are that "of social relations which provide individuals and groups with access to resources" (Kemenade et al. 7). These networks are referred to as social capital and are especially integral to neighborhoods with high immigrant and low-income populations. Research conducted by a number of Canadian studies including the General Social Survey (GSS) and the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (LSIC) supports the importance of social capital to the integration of immigrants to Canada (Zhao et al. 3). New immigrants face many obstacles when arriving in Canadian cities including finding accommodation, education and employment. Access to social networks, especially of people of corresponding culture, will greatly improve the integration and well-being of these new immigrants (Kemenade et al. 14). These networks range from family, friendship and organizational or community based networks. Members of low-income houses experience many of the same difficulties and could also benefit from increased access to social resources and interaction. Considering these population groups are vulnerable, they can experience a disaffiliation, severing them from their social networks and resulting in an experience of community similar to Relph's outsideness. Architecture can influence social capital as buildings and neighborhoods both ground and structure the networks. "Social capital is embedded in the built environment where it is sustained and reproduced by architectural programmes as spatially structured patterns of social structure" (Dovey 34). Social infrastructure including public space, libraries, and community centers are typical methods of increasing opportunity for social interaction. However, an understanding of community as assemblage demands a shift beyond conventional infrastructure to apply architecture to augment the connections and interactions within.

2: CONTEXT

22

The intent of this thesis is to apply the findings on the symbiotic relationship between humans and their environments in an architectural method to a local [neighborhood]. As communities with disjointed spatial and social structure, Toronto's priority neighborhoods were analyzed as potential project sites. According to the City of Toronto, priority neighborhoods are defined as "areas with extensive poverty and without many social and community services" (Hulchanski 25). The city's 2011 Census update ascertained that priority neighborhoods are made up of 66% visible minority members, and are usually post-industrial suburbs with low incomes. These neighborhoods are often adjacent to major service corridors and natural geographic features. These include railway and hydro corridors, major roads and highways, and natural watersheds. While they support the operation of the greater city, the property value of the surrounding areas is lowered due to the accompanying pollution leading to the influx of low-income and new immigrant groups (Ruffolo 34). 23

Figure 2.01: Weston Barrier Map

24

2.1 Weston
The neighborhood of Weston, Toronto, located around Weston Road and Lawrence Avenue West, emerged as an appropriate site because of the physical and social barriers that divide the community. While there is a high immigrant and low-income population, unlike many of the other priority neighborhoods, there exists a stark social and spatial contrast within the community.

Figure 2.02: Toronto Priority Neighborhoods

Even as an outside observer, it is evident that there are a number of physical barriers present in Weston. The most prominent of these are the Humber River which runs along the southwest border of the neighborhood and the Metrolinx/Canadian Pacific rail corridor that splits the community. Further examination of the spatial makeup reveals a number of social barriers that are enhanced by these physical borders. As a result, the neighborhood fails to operate as an assemblage, subsisting as an ensemble of disconnected lived spaces, enhancing the feelings of outsideness of different community groups. The outcome is the formation of multiple identities which exist as a source of conflict.   I wouldn't say they lack a sense of community, but they may not have as  much a sense of belonging to their community" (Archer).
Rahul Bhardwaj, president and CEO of the Toronto Community Foundation

25

Figure 2.03: Average Household Income and Visible Minority Status

26

The rail line, which spans over 30 meters in width at points, is the most prominent divider of social classes in the community. The northeast side is a residential area comprised of mid-sized, single family homes. The experience there is welcoming and one of safety however, the southwest side of the tracks paints a different picture. Formerly an industrial and commercial hub, the area has declined and is now occupied predominantly by high-rise apartment and social housing buildings and retail. According to data retrieved from Simply Maps Canada, the average annual household income of residents on this side of the tracks is significantly lower than those across the tracks (figure 2.03). Household income for 63% of the residents in Weston is under $50,000 most of whom reside in this more dense area (City of Toronto). The trend continues across other social demographics including visible minority and immigrant status, further supporting the argument that these physical elements act as barriers within the community. The physical barriers within the community contribute to a disjointed multiplicity of parts which leads to social barriers and hinders interactions. Place as assemblage will encourage the strengthening of Weston as a network with a community identity.

2.2 Existing Master Plan

Metrolinx was the first agency to begin infrastructure development in the community with their Go Transit and Union Pearson Express plans. They lowered their 3 rail lines, creating a covered tunnel from Church Street to King Street, while also building a new station south of Lawrence Avenue. This resulted in the permanent closure of the John Street crossing which has since been replaced with a pedestrian bridge (figure 2.05 f). Following the plans for the Metrolinx infrastructure investments, the city took the opportunity to create a revitalization plan for the community. The Weston 2021 Revitalization Strategy compiled findings from city and agency initiatives in the community which included public workshops, to determine opportunities for growth, reinvestment and future development (Keefe and Campbell). The major themes that emerged can be grouped in the following three categories:

30

Community Safety

Community safety and perception of safety to enhance the liveability of the area.

Neighborhood Identity

Creating a greater community identity by marketing existing assets and iconic elements and implementing new attractions.

Accessibility & Connectivity

Improve parks, streets and pathways (public space), access to social services and strengthen the connection to the city fabric.

e: Site Plan f: Pedestrian Bridge

Currently under construction, the city's resultant revitalization project is located on the former Weston Market site at the new John Street bridge (Figure 2.05). The plans include a 30 storey rental tower, a new outdoor public space for the market and other community events, as well as repurposing parts of the adjacent tower podium as an Arts hub and 26 affordable live/work suites for artists and their families. This plan does somewhat address the track barrier of the community. With the new outdoor market/event space and potential future development of the covered tunnel, it increases public space in the community. The pedestrian bridge improves accessibility across the tracks and also serves as a landmark site. However, as it stands, it is isolated and disconnected from the rest of the community. As is evident in these renderings, the proposal also lacks connection to the main artery of (Weston Road) and to the Humber River, existing as another isolated district. The river should be a beautiful asset to the community and only acts as a barrier because of the lack of access into the valley. Based on the research, the high-rise tower is not ideal for such a site and will only increase discomfort and lack of identity. Most of the community members who actually are seeking housing will not be able to afford the units anyways. 33

3: CONCEPTS

34

From the theoretical and contextual research, a number of recurring themes were derived. These themes were further analyzed in order to extrapolate a series of design strategies which will inform the final project. It is important to understand that this thesis does not intend to develop a mathematical procedure to create place, but an approach to the design of the lived-world of both every day and exceptional experiences.

3.1 Connect
It has been established that the community of Weston is currently comprised of a series of disconnected sectors, lacking physical and social links between them. Some are obstructed by physical barriers which encourage isolation by inhibiting interaction amongst different social groups within the community.

I.   

Establish and enhance paths between different areas to better tie the community  together. Depending on the location, this may include bridging over, or simply  improving accessibility by enhancing safety and appearance of connection  routes. (Figure 3.02a)

II. Improve public space including parks and street frontages. (Figure 3.02b) III. Provide access to social resources for immigrants and low-income residents.   (Figure 3.02c)

3.2 Interact
This concept seeks to expand beyond merely physically connecting two spaces. The final intervention should facilitate the interaction of components; human, natural and built, as a place of engagement.

I. Create and improve dynamic hubs which support community interaction through   the exchange of goods and ideas such as public markets and squares. Consider   use of place on non-market days. (Figure 3.03a) II. Mid-rise and mixed-use which are cognizant of the human scale and environment.  (Figure 3.03b) III. Activate street frontages and backs. (Figure 3.03c)

3.3 Network
The connections and interactions amongst people and their environments form the socio-spatial networks of community. Through the combination of human intentions, and the meaningful settings for human activities, identity of place is developed. An authentic sense of place is "being inside and belonging to your place both as an individual and as a member of community" (Relph 65) without having to reflect on it.

I. Consider how new buildings shape the surrounding area and how architecture can   permeate outwards beyond the façade and engage the community fabric.  (Figure 3.04a) II. Re-establish Weston Road as a main street while also enhancing auxiliary streets   and paths. (Figure 3.04b) III. Architecture as a component which contributes to multiple levels of assemblage.

4: DESIGN PROPOSAL

44

The design proposal reimagines the urban landscape of the heart of the Weston neighborhood. Implementing the design strategies previously derived from the theory and ensuing concepts, it strives to increase public pedestrian space and create place in order to significantly improve city life. With the understanding that people are drawn to spaces with other people, the proposal seeks to facilitate a range of optional and social activities in public space so that humans and their environment can converge in a network of place.

The photographs convey the path one must follow in order to cross from the north side of the neighborhood down to the Humber river. Commencing in the northern residential neighbourhood, there is an evident lack of physical and social connection to the south side. Single family Victorian homes, many of which are heritage sites, line the streets in a suburban fashion. While the pedestrian bridge is complete and awaiting opening day, to this point there is still no crossing southeast of Church Street. Once across the tracks on John Street, the city led construction project is underway at the former Weston Market parking lot. Approaching Weston Road, any remaining sense of human scale is all but lost. While the street is still fronted by small shops, the once bustling main street has declined considerably. With very little room for pedestrian life, the setting is dominated by moving and parked vehicles along wide streets with narrow sidewalks. Overall, the route is extremely disconnected and lacks any public space or semblance of human scale before the river park. As mentioned, this stretch of Weston Road was formerly the heart of the Weston Village and maintains such potential. With the recent increased accessibility to public transit, as well as the new Market space plans, and proximity to the river, it was chosen as the project site.

4.1.1 Paths From urban planning to place theory, the success of paths in improving city life is well documented. A major element of the design is the implementation of a pedestrian path network connecting the community. The location of the paths was determined from the site analysis through a number of studies. Site lines, views, proximity to [major] nodes and walking distance were all accounted for. The paths extend across the rail line to the north, down to the Humber Valley in the south and are supported by the major axis of Weston Road. They will improve pedestrian accessibility and circulation through the heart of the neighborhood as well as extending throughout Weston and beyond to the city. While the paths shape the basic form of the built project, the exterior building form also shapes public space. The proposed paths interconnect with existing parks and pathways to strengthen connections to the wider community including down to the river. Beyond circulation the intent was also to encourage optional and social activities so that people would connect beyond necessary commutes. As Gehl identified, people seek the presence of other people. As a result, active pedestrian life and activity are the basic elements of urban attractions. The paths are designed to facilitate active city life and a range of optional and social activities. The geometry and axes shape the planters along the paths, forming intrinsic edges, which also function as seating and meeting places. This presents pedestrians opportunities to sit and enjoy a performer playing music while they sip on a freshly brewed coffee or to simply enjoy the ambience of an autumn afternoon.

51

4.1.2 Public Space With the intent of local community revival, the design sculpts a major pedestrian promenade across the site, lined with shops and eateries, green spaces, and a winter ice rink and is connected to the community through auxiliary paths. Buildings one and two are topped with four stories of mixed-income co-op residences. This allows for an integrated demographic and strengthens the social network of the community. A recently immigrated family can significantly benefit from living in such a system for it provides both immediate and long-term access to community social networks. The leasable units will be owned by the co-op and existing tenants will be given right of first refusal for the new units. Buildings four and five also have four story blocks that can serve as either work or live spaces. As such, the program at grade echoes that of many such walkable promenades with small retail shops, restaurants, bars and community services. Finally, the proposal maintains the location of the city's new market square plan as well as the retrofit podium which will host twenty live-work artists residences and a cultural centre.

4.2.3 Social Resources As established, the neighborhood desperately lacks social resources for immigrants and low-income residents. The proposed Immigrant Education Centre (IEC) will provide accessible and local services for such people through career and language training. The public building is accessible from both Weston road and the promenade along the central north west axis of the intervention. The lofty atrium and tiered gathering space facilitate multiple layers of interaction amongst users. While expansive, the tiers offer spaces for intimate refuge where one can escape and study alone, or have lunch with classmates. The upper floors host interactive lounges, classrooms and flexible work spaces for local start-ups and businesses. Students from the nearby schools can set up after school on the tiered space or in one of the study rooms to work on homework while their parents complete training classes above. Local entrepreneurs can rent work space on the upper floors and take advantage of the networking and other provided resources. The IEC model aims for new immigrants to complete training and in turn find jobs and open businesses in the local community. The building also holds potential to serve as a satellite hub for nearby colleges in the future. Fully equipped with classrooms, workshops and interactive lounge spaces, the building could evolve into a central Student Centre offering similar services to students.

4.2.1 Hubs and Nodes Every intersection of paths forms a node and the opportunity for social and spatial interaction. As seen from the ice rink, the central square is formed at the intersection of all the paths, a natural meeting point and place of interaction. The mother bringing her child to daycare from her unit across the promenade can pick up a coffee and muffin in one of the shops on her way to work. Children can meet friends after school by the central statue before heading down to the river for a picnic or the GO station into town. The proposal is designed to permanently facilitate the existing farmers market in the North square, and host a variety of year round events in both squares. While the market currently operates from May to October, the new design would support a winter market to facilitate almost year round use. The Central Square can host festivals, exhibitions, demonstrations and other community events. Design moves, ranging from the planters and trees to building setbacks and formations are used to create opportunities for multiple layers of activity. While very public, the place provides areas of privacy, intimacy and security amongst the open spaces. The materials chosen including Corten steel and stone reference the history of the site while embracing the modern configuration of the neighborhood with brick and Victorian homes and stone from river valley.

4.2.2 Street Frontages and Backs By activating all sides of the buildings, the design adopts principles of Gehl and Lynch in order to promote active city life and eliminate dead zones. This creates a series of `interaction zones' across the neighborhood amongst the negative space. Reducing Weston Road to three lanes increases walkability with wider sidewalks as well as cycling conditions with room for bike lanes. This would promote improved pedestrian life and increase the appeal and social activity within the neighborhood. The `Living' backs of the new buildings on Weston Road form the pedestrian promenade which is the heart of the design proposal. The interstitial space between the north residential building and the pedestrian bridge becomes the market square.

4.3.1 Permeating Architecture The exterior facades were designed to shape and influence the surrounding site, while the upper block setbacks create a more intimate pedestrian atmosphere. Ground floor moves simultaneously form parkettes and restaurant patios while enhancing the thresholds to the pedestrian pathways. The built form spills out into the pathways which in turn cascade out onto streets, spreading across the neighborhood.

4.3.2 Main Street and Assemblage Activating or re-establishing Weston Road as a main street enhances city life and pedestrian volume. As a result, well connected auxiliary streets and paths will also experience coinciding boosts. As Relph and Dovey affirmed, assemblage supports itself through the series of dialectics rather than simply the sum of the individual components. Inset corner patios, the segmenting of the Weston block connecting the major paths and thus enlarging the network through auxiliary paths, as well as rooftop gardens all support the Main street. The sidewalk expansion will encourage more people to walk through the neighborhood and in turn, engage in more social activities. Strengthening the neighborhood axes along Weston Road and the promenade bolsters the connection to the surrounding city.

SPECULATION

74

The primary premise of the project is the formation of a network of pedestrian `paths', connecting the community and providing opportunities for physical and social interaction. Designed by identifying site geometries, site lines, and walking distances, they serve to eliminate both physical and social barriers in the community. These paths are supported by mid-rise, mixed use buildings with frontages along Weston Road as well as some of the major pathways. The program of the central building, the IEC, is aimed at providing social resources to immigrants and low-income families including job and language training as well as work spaces and communal zones. Every design move is a product of the outlined design strategies in order to remain consistent with the intent of designing space which facilitates social interaction and consists of components that are interrelated as an assemblage of place.

75

Originally derived from the basic understanding of the symbiotic human-environment relationship, the thesis evolved into a study of this reciprocity within the scope of public space. The concept of place as a socio-spatial assemblage rooted in experience and identity was a major element in shaping the final design intervention. Discerning that the significance lies not in the individual components, but in the interactions between them, architectural strategies were developed for the specific site of Weston, within the themes of Connect, Interact and Network. The intent was never to solve every social issue present in the neighborhood. The intervention strived to act as a catalyst for change and community supported development, by implementing the theories and strategies deduced in this thesis. The connectivity and functionality of the paths was the most significant aspect of the intervention, whilst the visual appearance of the buildings maintained lesser importance. However, the design of both interior spaces and exterior facades were integral to the thesis in shaping the public spaces. By facilitating a range of activities, influencing surrounding space, and creating an intimate pedestrian environment, the design ultimately seeks to provide the components and setting for the natural development of `place'.

76

The successful intervention would grow over time, expanding the assemblage socially and physically. Weston Road maintains the potential to develop into a thriving community path, and as social networks become more established and infrastructure is improved, the neighborhood could become a major hub within the city. As immigrants `graduate' from the IEC and move on to their careers, the model would take on a cyclical nature, with these members supporting the economic prosperity of the community as new members move in. However, as mentioned in the thesis, unlike space, place is not bound by physical dimensions. The proposal, and specifically the IEC, is designed in a manner that caters to specific needs and yet is highly adaptable to future growth. The IEC can serve as an educational building for a college or university, or even function as a local business incubator. The proposal provides the elements to achieve these outlined goals regarding place and community networks in the neighborhood of Weston. Given the position of place, it is understood that the design is only part of the relationship, for it is only after the implementation of people that any architectural intervention can be successful.
