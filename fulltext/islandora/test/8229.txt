Introduction
  Roberto Ariganello was born in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada in 1961. He wastheExecutiveDirectorofLIFT(LiaisonofIndependentFilmmakers)from2003 to2006,andheservedontheboardofCFMDC(CanadianFilmmakersDistribution Center)from1999to2002.Hemadeatotalofsixfilms,including"Yesterday'sWine" (1999), "Shelter" (2001), "Non-zymase Pentathlon" (1995), "Contrafacta"  (2000), "Lotería"(1996),and"Gesture"(1999).Hetragicallydrownedin2006inanaccident, shortlyafter donating a truckloadof editing equipmentto theAtlanticFilmmakers Co-operative in Nova Scotia. He completed six independent films that made a significantcontributiontoCanadianindependentcinemas. According to Ariganello's friends and colleagues, he was obsessed with filmmaking,especiallytheuseofsuper8mmfilm.Hispassionforindependentfilms isreflectedinthecollectiondiscussedinthisthesis.ThemaincollectionatCFMDC consists of eleven 8mm films, twenty-two super 8mm films and fifty-four 16mm films,comprisinghomemovies,unfinishedworkandexperimentalfilmclipscreated by Ariganello himself. The content of these films is diverse, from landscapes of differentcities to documentationsof daily life (Figures 1.1and1.2).The collection was donated by Chris Gehman and Ariganello's other friends to CFMDC in 2006. However,nodocumentationregardingthedonationcouldbefound,whichmeansall theinformationondonationprocesswasprovidedtotheauthorbyChrisGehman. My project at CFMDC included inspecting, cataloguing, and rehousing Ariganello's collection. Most of the films are found in the original Kodachrome color reversal stock box (Figure 1.3). Labels and handwriting can be foundon some of the films. However, metadata such as the year of production and the title are too limited. Datingthefilmsmustrelyontheirmanufacturingcodesonthefilmstock.Duetothe condition of these films, they could not be projected for this project; instead, they were assessed by running them through a magnifying lens, reading Ariganello's

Thisthesisconsistsoftwochaptersandthreeappendices.Thefirstchapterisa literature review, presenting background information on CFMDC, Ariganello as an independent filmmaker, and articles regardinghisdeath in2006. It alsoincludes a briefhistoryof8mm,super8mm,and16mmfilms,whichisimportantindatingthe date of Ariganello's films. Some relevant bibliography on film cataloguing and the preservationoforphanfilmsisdiscussedinthischapteraswell.Thesecondchapter is the case study of The Roberto Ariganello Home Movie and Personal Collection, which gives specific, and practical information on the donation process, research methodology,inventorymaking,andarecommendationonpreservation.

Chapter 1: Literature Review
In what follows, I offer a brief introduction to Canadian Filmmakers DistributionCentre­theinstitutionwhereRobertoAriganello'spersonalcollection is stored, thelife and professionalstatusofAriganello, backgroundinformationon different film gauges, film cataloguing, and the preservation of orphan films. This survey provided me with adequate preparation before my on-site research at CFMDC.Togetherwiththeliterature,theinspectionandcataloguingofthecollection, and the conversations with Chris Kennedy and Chris Gehman, they provide a comprehensivesurveyofmytopicofresearchandmyworkingmethodology.  1.1CanadianFilmmakersDistributionCentre Founded in 1967 and based in Toronto, Canada, CFMDC is a non-profit institution whose mission is thedistribution and material andspiritual supportof independently produced films, as well as contributing to the creation of a culture receptive to both independent filmmakers and the exhibition of their work. 1 AccordingtoIlinkaMihailescu,itwasfoundedbyagroupofyoungfilmmakers,who met at the University of Toronto's Victoria College to screen various experimental works.ThismeetingledtothecreationofCFMDC.2 BasedonthecataloguebrochureofCFMDC(publishedwiththesupportofthe OntarioArtsCouncilArtsInvestmentFund)CFMDCdistributedover3,700filmtitles by 3,500 filmmakers worldwide.3 Thefilms wereproducedfromthe 1950'sto the present, and thecollection continues togrowsteadily.CFMDC alsomakes its films available for rental and sale to both institutions and private individuals.

In this report, Ariganello's friendandcolleagueDeirdreLoguestatesthat"Ariganello'sinfluenceandimpacton thenationalfilmcommunityis``immeasurable,''andthatthedeathofAriganellois "really, really tragic."8 Lastly, an article by Kristen Lipscombe published in Halifax Chronicle Herald, which is similar in content to previous articles, additionally mentions that Ariganello was a helpful person "who loved making films, helping othersandlivinglifetothefullest.9 Ariganello's status and dedication to Canadian independent filmmaking is undeniable,andheisacknowledgedasoneofthemostvitalculturalworkerswhen it comes to his devotion to the independent film and art industries.

Catalog, the author describes effective cataloguing decisions that not only capture adequate metadata of filmcollections,butalsomeetthe needsof theusers within the institution. It is easier for the users to access information about a collection quicklywhenitsdescriptionisconcise.However,budgetsforcataloguingarealways limited, thus, making the judgment on the value of the collection and the level of descriptionveryimportant.15  RegardingAriganello'scollection,themetadatathatarerelevantforcataloguing include coverage (place and time), creator, date (production date and edge code date), description, format (gauge and length), color, sound, identifier, language (dialogue and title), film polarity (positive or negative), base type (acetate or polyester),copyright,subject(genre),title,type,note,andcondition.Themetadata standard chosen for the inventory of Ariganello's collection is Dublin Core. Using Dublin Core will increase the efficiency of the discovery and the retrieval of each work. According to the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, Dublin Core metadata is "used to supplement existing methods for searching and indexing Web-based metadata, regardless of whether the corresponding resource is an electronic documentora`real'physicalobject." 16 In "Documenting the Process of Film Preservation," Karen Gracy presents the filmpreservationprocessindetailwiththeaidofdiagrams.Shedividestheprocess intoeight steps, the thirdofwhich isaboutthe inspectionandthe inventoryingof the films. In the conclusion, the author argues that the purpose of her study is to remind archivists to consider film as a medium carrying its cultural value with it: "By studying this community as a sociocultural phenomenon rather than as an object of historical or critical analysis, we can reflect not onlyon what we do, but

also on what we value and how those values affect our actions." 17  Although Ariganello'spersonalcollectionmaynotbeseenassignificantashisfinishedwork, oritspreservationmaynotbetreatedasaprioritytask,itstillcarriesitsvalue.By looking into this collection, anyone who is interested in Ariganello's work can acquiremoreinformationofAriganello'sbeginnings,theformationofhisfilmstyle, the influence of his family and his early experiences. A variety of cultural conventions are represented in this collection as well, as the films were shot in different countries. The collection will be more accurately appraised when its intrinsicvalueisdiscovered.  1.5PreservationofOrphanFilm Asorphanfilms,thiscollectionofAriganello'sworkhasbeenignoredforalong period of time. Ariganello's home movie and personal collection may not be as famousashisotherfilmproductionsthataredistributedatCFMDC.Nonetheless,it is crucial to investigate his earlier work, the formation of his film style, and the influences on his films. Toni Treadway addressed the significance of preserving home movies in "Home Movies: A Basic Primer on Care, Handling, Storage" publishedin2016:  
Home movies hold both a personal and cultural treasure that can last a long time for future generations toenjoy...Home moviesareas important to preserveand share as old photos, old diaries, old paintings and sketches, great-grandmother's quilt or great-grandfather's carving.

importance of preserving orphan films back in 1993. Dan Streible traces the developmentofpreservationworkoforphanfilmsin"TheRoleofOrphanFilmsin the 21st Century Archive." He states that the phrase "Orphan films" "formally categorized orphan films as a problem child for archives" starting in 1993.20 Preserving orphan films is still a challenging task for institutions at the present time.AsStreibleconcludes,"thestudyoffilmmaynotlongremaindominantinthe postcelluloidageahead,buttheconceptof`orphan'shouldcontinuetoserveasan incisive metaphor for archivists and scholars in the twenty-first century." 21 Ariganello's personal collection consists of a variety of amateur films that fall under the umbrella of "orphan films":homemovie,travelfilmand documentary. According to Ariganello's friend Chris Gehman, who was involved with donating the collection to CFMDC, most of the films of this collection were not shot by Ariganello himself. This is not surprising since Ariganellowas keento usefound footage to make films. Therefore, the creator and date of most films in the collection are impossible to clarify, which makes the copyright status of this collectionhardtojudge.Itrequiresarchivistsorresearcherstodevoteadditional timeandresourcestodiscoveritsvalueandsignificance.   

Chapter 2: Case Study: The Roberto Ariganello Home Movie and Personal Collection
    This chapter focuses on the details of the donation process of the Roberto Ariganello'scollection,themethodologiesofmyresearch,andthedifficultiesIran into during the cataloguing process. As "orphan films," this collection needs a different set of metadata than commercial (fiction) films when making an

inventory. Additionally, ethical issues arose during the cataloguing process. This chapter also outlines some preservation recommendations and suggestions of more suitable institutions for the storage of this collection. The appendices includes my interview with Chris Gehman and Chris Kennedy who provided me with much informationon this collection,the tables of catalogued filmswiththe relevant metadata, and other relevant documentation of Roberto Ariganello, including his curriculum vitae of Ariganello, the manuscripts related to his film Gesturesaboutthesoundtape,andstillsfromthefilmLoteríashotbyAriganello. 2.1DonationProcess       RobertoAriganello'spersonalcollectionwasdonatedbyhisoldclassmate andfriendChrisGehman,theformerexecutivedirectorofCFMDCDeirdreLogue, andthedirectorofthetechnologydepartmentofLIFTKarlReinsalu,toCFMDCin 2007 or 2008. However, Gehman couldn't remember the details of the donation and no documentation regarding the donation process could be found after ten years.     The reason for choosing CFMDC as the place to store Ariganello's collection was twofold. Firstly, CFMDC is equipped with the appropriate storage space to keepthecollectioninasafevaultwithatemperatureandhumiditycontrolsystem. Secondly, Ariganello's finished works were already in CFMDC's collection before thisdonation,whichprovidesresearcherswithgreaterpossibilitiesforaccessand studyopportunities.However,sinceCFMDCisnotanarchiveandthecollectionis not suitable for distribution, the collection should probably be sent to a more suitable institution in the future. Several recommendations are given in the "PreservationRecommendations"sectionofthisthesis.   2.2Methods 2.2.1Text-basedResearch

Even though there's a scarcity of information on Ariganello, my interview with Ariganello's colleagues and friends Chris Gehman and Chris KennedyprovidedmewithusefulcontextonbothAriganelloandthiscollection.  My research on CFMDC included the official brochure of CDMDC and its website,aswellasrelevantjournalarticles.Visitingtheinstitutionandtakingpart in the rehousing work (the physical relocation of all the collections) of CFMDC were also useful in my research process and inmytrainingtousetheFileMaker systemtomaketheinventory.

2.2.2On-siteResearch:PhysicalInspection      Roberto Ariganello's collection is stored in a plastic box that is about 48 inchesinlength,37inchesinwidth,and26inchesinheight.Itconsistsofeleven 8mmfilms,twenty-onesuper8mmfilms,andfifty-four16mmfilms.The8mmand super 8mm films are kept in random film boxes or winded onmetal and plastic reels (Figures 2.1 and 2.2), while most of the 16mm films are in the Kodak Ektachrome andKodachrome cardboard boxes from the film laboratory. In most instances,thereisa100feet-longsilentfilminthecolorboxs,withhandwritingon thebox(Figure2.2).Asmallnumberoffilmsintheboxareinseveralpiecesthat required re-attaching or splicing. In that case, artist tape (a tape that has a low tack adhesive) was used to attach them together temporarily.

2.2.3On-siteResearch:CataloguingandMakingtheInventory The films were catalogued on FileMaker Pro after inspection and necessary repairs. CFMDC uses FileMaker Pro to catalogue all its films in distribution. It providesstaff with a complete databasewithinformationoneach film,including film title, filmmaker, year, film length, country, region, language, format, sound, color,category/subject,andsoon.Thephysicalcondition,thebookinginformation including the client'sname,shippingdate andthe price canalso befound inthe FileMakersystem.AlthoughallsixofAriganello'sfilmsarestoredanddistributed byCFMDC,theboxwithhispersonalcollectionisnotmeantfordistributionsince it only consists of unfinished clips and home movies. Therefore, CFMDC is now consideringcreatinganewarchivaldatabaseforthecollectionsthatarenotmeant fordistributionfeaturingadditionaldocumentationonthesefilms.Theinventory madeforAriganello'scollectionconsistsofspreadsheets(SeeAppendixC),andit will be imported into FileMaker once the archival database with the correspondingmetadatafieldsiscreated. Themetadataofthearchivewillbedifferentfromthedatabaseofthefilmsin distribution. The Ariganello collection hasn't been officially accessioned yet. Therefore,there'snocurrentmetadataorphysicaldescriptionofthecollection.As Ialreadymentioned,themetadatastandardthatweusedtoprovideaccesstothe Ariganello'scollectionintheinventoryisDublinCore.Thefieldsnecessaryforthe archival database include contributor, coverage (of place and time), creator,date (production year and edge code year), description, format (gauge and length), identifier,language,publisher,relation,right,source,subject(genre),title,andtype. After inspecting all the filmsinAriganello's collection, I decidedto remove some fields(contributor,publisher,andrelation),butaddfieldsfor"Notes,""Condition," "Film Polarity," and "Base Type" dueto the specific nature of this collection.The followingthreesectionsintroducethefieldsthatneedtobeexplained.

2.23iNamingConventions The naming process is related to two metadata fields in the records: "Identifier" and "Title." The identifier is "an unambiguous reference to the resourcewithinagivencontext."26 Inthiscase,thefilmswereroughlycategorized by their film gauges, and were given accession numbers starting with "2018.0001.0001." The first fourdigits showthe accession yearofthecollection; thefourdigitsinthemiddlerepresenttheaccessionnumberofthecollection.As all 86 films in the box are considered as a single collection, this number will be "0001"forallfilms.Thefilmscanbedistinguishedbythelastfourdigits:eachfilm inthecollectionwasgivenauniquenumberfrom"0001"to"0086".Allfilmswere labeledbytapewithhandwrittenidentifiernumber(Figure2.5).  Since all the films in Ariganello's collection are unfinished clips, documentaries, and home movies, they don't have official titles like commercial films. Handwritten single words or numbers can be found on some cardboard

boxesorlabels,whichmayindicatethelocation,timeperiod,andpeopleinvolved. However, Ariganello's death made it impossible to clarify the name and the content of most prints. The handwriting and labels on the boxes and reels were used as a reference when creating names for some prints. Films without any legibleinformationontheboxesorreelswerelabeled"[Untitled]".Squarebrackets were put onthe outsideof all thetitlesindicating that thetitle was givenbythe archivistinsteadofbeingassignedbythefilmmaker.


2.23iiCreator  Chris Gehman, the classmate and co-worker of Roberto Ariganello provided much assistance in figuring out the details of the films in the collection. After lookingintothecollectionandinspectingthecontents,Gehmanfoundoutthatthe film with the identifier [2018.0001.0021] was part of the raw footage of Ariganello's film Yesterday's Wine (1999) and the shooting location was Mexico City.Thefilm[2018.0001.0029]wasshotbyAriganelloaswell.Thefollowingfilms were probably made by Ariganello: [2018.0001.0001], [2018.0001.0010], [2018.0001.0011], [2018.0001.12], [2018.0001.0013], [2018.0001.0014],

[2018.0001.0015], and [2018.0001.0016]; however, Gehman couldn't define the creatorwithcertainty.Asaresult,allthefieldswithanuncertainattributionare followedbyaquestionmarkintheinventory. ItisalsoworthmentioningthatthereisaVHStapeandamagnetictapewitha letter in the collection. The VHS tape formely belonging to CFMDC contains the documentary Lotería (1996) made by Roberto Ariganello and Federico Hidalgo aboutthestreetlotterybusinessinMexico(Figure2.6).CFMDCreturnedthetape to Ariganello since the format of tape had fallen into disuse. The magnetic tape representstheinterviewwithAriganelloconductedbythejournalistCarstenKnox (Figure2.7).ThetypewrittenletterwithKnox'ssignatureisdatedAugust28,2006,

2.23iiiEthicalIssues
  The collection of Ariganello had not been inspected or catalogued before

thisproject.Therefore,therewasnoinventoryoranynotethatcouldbereferred to. Dueto the paucity ofinformation on it,itwasa challenge formeto interpret the details such as the creator and the content. As I mentioned in the "Introduction,"duetotheconditionofthesefilms,thedescriptionofthecontentis based on viewing the film through a Light Box Loupe, reading Ariganello's handwritingonthefilmboxes,andanyinformationthatcouldbefoundduringthe research instead of screening them through a projector. As a result, the interpretation wasnecessarily subjectiveto some extent,which may bring about misconceptionsandaffectthefutureaccess.Sincesomeofthehandwritingonthe filmboxisillegible,theomissionofsomeinformationwasinevitable.

2.3PreservationRecommendations Sincenopreservationworkhasbeencompletedonthefilmsyet,itisurgent to preserve the original prints. The condition of Roberto's home movie series is stated in the "Condition" field of the inventory in "Appendix C." Most films have slight emulsion and base scratches, slight warpage and shrinkage, moderate dirt adheredtotheprintandonereelshowsslightcolorfading.However,someofthe 16mmfilmsthatarestoredintheKodakboxofRoberto'sfilmcollectionareina bad condition, including mold on several films. Therefore, work still needs to be done after the cataloguing, including rehousing the original prints, and storing theminaplacewithconstanttemperatureandhumiditycontroltoavoidfurther contamination. Digital preservation is another option, which will make the collectionmoreaccessibletoresearchers.However,duetothelimitedbudgetand resources,thiscollectionmaynotbeconsideredasaprioritytobedigitized.  Roberto's own films were already in distribution with CFMDC, and after he died,hisfamilyandfriendswhocleanedouthishomepassedthiscollectiononto CFMDC. Therefore, the collection is the original and only available film prints in existence. According to Chris Gehman, Ariganello was planning to make a film about his grandfather living in Argentina before he died. In this collection, few filmswerefoundthatwereshotinArgentina.Itisoftenhardtoconfirmwhethera filmwasshotbyAriganellohimselforwaspurchasedfromafleamarket,owingto theuniquecharacterofthecollection.  Sincethecollectionwillnotbedistributedinthefuture,lookingforasuitable placetostoreAriganello'scollectionpermanentlyisanothermatterofconcernto CFMDC.Thebestplaceforthiscollectionmayincludelocalarchivesandlibraries. ChrisKennedyandChrisGehmanprovidedsomeadviceontheproperinstitutions tostorethecollection,whichcanbefoundin"AppendixA."Hesuggestedthatthe collection could besent toarchives likethe MediaCommonsofthe Universityof

Conclusion
Cataloguing and making the inventory for Roberto Ariganello's personal collection is one of the most important steps for researchers or people who are interestedinAriganello'sfilmstogetgreateraccesstohisfinishedandunfinished work. It is also helpful to discover its intrinsic value so that archivists can make better decisions onthepreservationwork needed. Thisproject focused moreon thebasicmetadataofthecollection,ratherthanthedetailsofeachfilm.However, the information on most films is toolimitedtoclarifyatthis stage,which means thereisstillplentyofworktobedoneforandbyresearchersinthefuture. Manydecisionsmadeinthisprojectweresubjective,asaresultofthelimited availability of information on this collection.

He made the film "Non-Zymase Pentathlon" and "Contrafacta" with Ariganello in 1995 and 2000. Gehman was involved with donating the personal collection of Ariganello to CFMDC and provided great help with cataloguing the collection. The interview took place on April 6, 2018 at Vtape at the 401 Richmond building. ---
