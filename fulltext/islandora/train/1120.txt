An Examination of Individual Provider Characteristics in the Dissemination and Uptake of Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Master of Arts 2011 Amy Brown-Bowers Psychology Ryerson University Abstract Support for the use of evidence-based psychological practice in Canada is growing, but there remains a large gap between psychotherapy research and real-world psychotherapy practice. There also exists a chasm between the number of clinicians who attend psychotherapy trainings and those who implement the training material into their clinical practice. The present study examined individual provider characteristics in the uptake of Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. There was a trend for an interaction between attitudes toward manualized treatments and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTSD. Specifically, as attitudes in each area were more positive, piecemeal uptake of the protocol decreased. Contrary to hypothesis, prior training in couple therapy or in cognitive-behavioural therapy for PTSD, years since highest degree was completed, and therapeutic orientation were not associated with uptake.

Acknowledgements First I want to thank my supervisor and mentor, Dr. Candice Monson, for selecting me from a pile of deserving applicants. Dr. Monson has rapidly become a valued and important person in my life and a role model in how to be a researcher, clinician and young professional with great integrity and poise. Her mentorship through my thesis has helped get me UNSTUCK many a time along the way. I am deeply grateful for this relationship and look forward to the next four years. I want to thank Dr. Martin Antony for his mentorship over the past three years. When I approached Dr. Antony to be an external supervisor for my undergraduate honours thesis, I didn't yet know all of his accolades and contributions to the field of psychology (had I known I might never have approached him). His willingness to work with me and to carve out time in his schedule continues to be humbling. His patience, careful editing, and encouraging feedback has been appreciated. He continues to be a role model for me for how to be a successful researcher and leader in a way that is collaborative and congenial. I want to thank Dr. Colleen Carney for her role as third reader. Dr. Carney's tough and fair approach to research methodology has shaped my thinking and will continue to do so moving forward. I especially want to thank her for having described me as fearless and professional in my clinical research methods class. I am very grateful for the hard work of Derek Cozzi, research assistant extraordinaire, throughout this project. His professionalism, attention to detail, thoughtfulness, sense of humour, and vegan baked goods have been much appreciated. I wish to thank my Dad and Mom, Ray Bowers and Donna Brown-Bowers, for their cheerleading. Their willingness to read my manuscripts, look at my presentation slides and listen

iv

to my stories has meant a great deal to me. Their encouragement and support as I changed careers and worked through this Master's (and their frequent donations of groceries and dogsitting services) have made this moment in my life possible. They are staunch supporters of me and I collect their encouragement and love like pieces of rare art. I want to thank my best friend, Tanja Futter, for her listening and empathy during this journey. Her determination to live an authentic life and to make use of her natural gifts and skills gave me the kick in the butt I needed to go back to school for psychology. I want to thank my sister, Laura Brown-Bowers, and brother-in-law, Mitchell Lewis, for their part in my success. Laughter, levity, backyard barbecues and beer go a long way in releasing stress over uncooperative statistics. I would also like to thank my dear friends Alysia and Rachael for their cheerleading, encouragement and, when needed, commiseration. Finally, I wish to thank my friends at Ryerson, especially Jen Rouse, Anne Wagner, and the members of the IMPACT lab for becoming a new family for me. The friendships I have found in these individuals have sustained me along the way.

Dedication I would like to dedicate this thesis to my Mom and Dad. I can't adequately express how much their love, understanding, curiosity, encouragement, patience and dog-sitting have meant to me over the past two years. They have reared me, raised me and continued to support me long after I was launched from the nest. I look forward to paying these gifts both forward and backward in the years to come.

An Examination of Individual Provider Characteristics in the Dissemination and Uptake of Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Support for the use of evidence-based psychological practice in Canada appears to be growing (Hunsley, 2000), but there remains a large gap between psychotherapy research and real-world psychotherapy practice (e.g., Barlow, 1981; Riemer, Rosof-Williams, & Bickman, 2005). Scientists have examined this discrepancy from a knowledge-translation perspective and have found that there also exists a large gap between the number of clinicians who attend psychotherapy trainings and those who implement the newly acquired material into their clinical practice (e.g., Goisman,Warshaw, & Keller, 1999; Stewart & Chambless, 2007). Researchers have examined dissemination and implementation by exploring traininglevel factors (i.e., length of training workshop and training modality; Backer, Lilberman, & Kuehnel, 1986;
DeViva, 2006; Rosenberg, 2006). The present study contributed to dissemination science by examining

trainee-level factors and their associations with implementation of a novel conjoint psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. The present study examined individual provider characteristics in the uptake of CognitiveBehavioral Conjoint Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CBCT for PTSD; Monson & Fredman, 2010) after dissemination of the therapy. Specifically, the study examined associations between select individual provider characteristics and individual provider uptake of the CBCT for PTSD protocol following attendance of a workshop on the protocol. The individual provider characteristics that were examined included the following: attitudes toward manualized treatments; attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individual PTSD; prior training in couple therapy; prior training in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for PTSD; years since highest degree was completed; and predominant therapeutic orientation. The outcome variable, uptake of the therapy, was assessed in two ways. Self-reported "piecemeal protocol uptake" was defined as the selection and use of specific elements of the protocol and was assessed using a checklist of unique and essential elements of the protocol. Self-reported "prescribed 1

protocol uptake" was defined as systematic use of the protocol as outlined in the manual and was assessed using a series of questions about use of the protocol and intention to use the entire protocol. This thesis begins with an overview of relevant research on this topic, followed by a description of the study hypotheses, methods, results and discussion. The Importance of Treatment Fidelity The development and proliferation of psychological treatment manuals, which expanded dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s, has been credited with bringing great advancements to psychotherapy research (e.g. Addis, 1997; Carroll et al., 2000; Waltz, Addis, Koerner, & Jacobson, 1993). Manualized treatments were said to facilitate more precise, consistent and pure delivery of protocols, which allowed for more valid treatment comparisons and research conclusions (Waltz, Addis, Koerner, & Jacobson, 1993). As expectations for precise and consistent delivery of protocols increased, so too did the expectation that researchers would account for their methods for assessing the degree of precision and consistency with which treatments were delivered. Researchers were expected to account for how true to form therapies were delivered, that is, their treatment fidelity (Waltz, Addis, Koerner, & Jacobson, 1993). Moncher and Prinz (1991) underscored the importance of being able to verify fidelity in comparative treatment research in order to be able to make valid comparisons of treatment outcomes. Specifically, lack of manual adherence or lack of therapist competence may in part explain null findings, or may lead to erroneous conclusions about the superiority or inferiority of particular protocols for treating particular disorders (Perepletchikova, & Kazdin, 2005; Resnick et al, 2005; Waltz, Addis, Koerner, & Jacobson, 1993). An essential component of implementation research (i.e., the study of methods to promote the uptake of new or underused scientific findings by health care providers; Rubenstein & Pugh, 2006), is the assessment of treatment fidelity in the providers to whom the treatment was disseminated (Carroll et al., 2000; Kazdin, 1986; Moncher & Prinz, 1991). Further, Breitsenstein and colleagues (2010) posited that implementation fidelity matters greatly in that it can explain the often largely discrepant findings between 2

treatment outcomes produced in highly controlled clinical trials and outcomes produced in highly uncontrolled community settings once protocols have been widely disseminated. Thus, systematic assessments of treatment fidelity increase the validity of treatment studies and provide quality control for protocols as they are being disseminated (Breitsenstein, Gross, Garvey, Hill, Fogg, & Resnick, 2010). Treatment fidelity is conceptualized as being multidimensional in the literature (e.g., McHugh, Murray & Barlow, 2009; Moncher & Prinz, 1991). Although there are different perspectives on what specific dimensions treatment fidelity encompasses, there is general consensus that one component is treatment integrity, which is the degree to which the therapist delivered the protocol as intended. The Role of Treatment Fidelity in Dissemination Research Not only is assessment of fidelity essential in treatment research, it is also integral to dissemination research (Waltz, Addis, Koerner, & Jacobson, 1993). Assessment of adherence during the dissemination phase of treatment development provides trainers with information about which elements of a protocol are easier for therapists to grasp and implement with ease versus those elements that are more difficult to learn and implement, and as such, may require additional instruction and supervision (Breitsenstein, Gross, Garvey, Hill, Fogg, & Resnick, 2010; Moncher & Prinz, 1991; Waltz et al., 1993). Waltz et al. (1993) situated assessment of adherence within a larger dissemination cycle that includes creating a protocol, writing the manual, training therapists, and assessing therapists' performance. These components create a feedback loop resulting in changes to the manual that improve treatment fidelity. Likewise, Fixen and colleagues (2005) proposed a conceptual framework for implementation in which assessment of implementation fidelity serves as a key feedback component used to inform changes in training practices, selection of trainees, and appropriate posttraining supervisory supports (Fixen et al., 2005). Glasgow, Lichenstein, and Marcus (2003) stated that, for large-scale dissemination efforts, it is important for researchers to understand the ingredients for faithful implementation so they can facilitate consistent and faithful application of the protocol. They asserted that this is particularly important when 3

dissemination efforts include clinicians with different levels of training and experience. In such cases, assessment of therapist uptake can provide important information about individual provider variables that were associated with the use of the therapy. Efforts to Operationalize and Assess Adherence One of the great challenges faced by treatment and dissemination researchers has been the lack of an effective and widely-endorsed method of assessing and reporting uptake and adherence. Thus, researchers have developed and utilized idiosyncratic strategies, with little consistency across the field. Existing methods to assess adherence have ranged in terms of their complexity, their source of data, their scope, and their purpose. For example, sources of data may include process notes, transcripts, segments of audio- or video-recorded sessions, direct observation, and/or implementer self-report (Moncher & Prinz, 1991; Waltz, et al., 1993). The gold standard is largely considered to be the use of video-recorded treatment samples (Moncher & Prinz, 1991; Ogden et al, 2005; Waltz, et al., 1993), however, this approach is expensive, timeand labour-intensive, and impractical for large-scale dissemination studies which require simple, reliable, resource-light and efficient methods of fidelity data collection. The checklist approach. The simplest way of assessing adherence is said to be a categorical indication of occurrence versus nonoccurrence of elements of the protocol (Waltz, Addis, Koerner, & Jacobson, 1993). Researchers typically create a checklist of protocol specifics that are "checked off" as they are observed to have occurred in treatment. Checklists may also include proscribed items, that is, techniques that are in direct violation of the treatment protocol. Checklists are versatile in that they can be used with video- or audio-recorded sessions, in vivo, or by self-report (Waltz, et al, 1993). A checklist approach to measuring adherence has been used in a number of studies (e.g., Collins, Eck, Kick, Schröter, & Batra, 2009; Hogue, Henderson, Dauber, Barajas, Fried, & Liddle, 2008; Schefft & Kanfer, 1987). For example, Hogue and colleagues' (2008) study examined the impact of treatment adherence and therapist competence on treatment outcome for adolescent behaviour problems. They 4

employed a Therapist Behavior Rating Scale ­ Competence (Hogue et al., 2008) in order to assess adherence and competence. The scale included a list of items covering interventions prescribed in the treatment, and therapists were given ratings by observers based on successful or unsuccessful completion of each item on the list (Hogue, et al., 2008). The scale was reported to have good to excellent interrater reliability for adherence and fair to poor reliability for competence. Results indicated that treatment adherence predicted treatment outcome and that greater adherence ratings predicted greater reductions in substance-related behaviours and problems. Singer (2002) examined therapist self-report ratings versus independent observer ratings of adherence to a family-based prevention program using the Therapist Behavior Rating Scale-2nd version. Singer found moderate to strong correlations between the two, indicating good concordance rates. Singer concluded that observers and therapists shared a common perspective of adherence in the study and that self-report checklists may be a viable method of assessing adherence. Individual Provider Predictors of Psychotherapy Uptake Although research on predictors of psychotherapy protocol uptake is still in the early stages, there exists a small and growing body of research on the links between individual provider characteristics and actual or intended uptake of evidence-based practices (e.g., Addis & Krasnow, 2000; Gray, Elhai, & Schmidt, 2007; Salloum, Sulkowski, Sirrine, & Storch, 2009). Two areas that have been examined with regard to psychotherapy protocol uptake are provider attitudes and prior training. Attitudes about manualized psychotherapies. Therapists have been found to hold a range of negative beliefs about manualized treatments, and these negative beliefs are hypothesized to impede uptake of them (e.g., Addis & Krasnow, 2000; Addis, Wade, & Hatgis, 1999). In their study of 891 licensed psychologists across the United States, Addis and Krasnow (2000) explored attitudes toward psychotherapy treatment manuals. Factor analysis revealed two global sets of attitudes toward manuals: Negative Process attitudes and Positive Outcome attitudes. Negative Process attitudes include, for example, the belief that 5

manuals have a dehumanizing effect on the therapeutic process and that manuals emphasize technique over flexibility and therapeutic alliance. Positive Outcome attitudes include, for example, the belief that manuals help facilitate and guide the therapeutic process. Their study found considerable variability in attitudes toward, and experiences with, manuals. More specifically, 34% of participants reported positive experiences or impressions of manuals, 32% reported negative experiences or impressions, and 45% reported neutral impressions or experiences. Likewise, Salloum and colleagues (2009) identified a number of attitudinal barriers to using empirically-supported treatments for childhood anxiety disorders in social work practice. Some of these attitudes included "the therapeutic relationship could be damaged by using manualized treatments," "protocols that are created in controlled environments are not generalizable to real-world settings," and "manualized treatments limit creativity" (Salloum, Sulkowski, Sirrine, & Storch, 2009). In their paper reviewing and summarizing issues in the dissemination of cognitive-behaviour therapy, Taylor and Chang (2008) stated that many developers of protocols erroneously assume that clinicians are inherently motivated to implement protocols backed by evidence and that dissemination of evidence-based treatments will naturally occur. Failure to take into account the attitudes held by individual providers is an oversight that may, in part, explain the large chasm between the existence of evidence-based protocols and the actual use and uptake of them. Taylor and Chang (2008) pointed out that many clinicians view clinical research trials with skepticism because the patient populations are often narrowly defined and nonreflective of the population that clinicians serve in their work settings. Further, Backer, Lilberman, and Kuehnel (1986) noted that negative and even suspicious attitudes toward new treatments may impede implementation. For example, Taylor and Chang (2008) noted that clinicians find structured interventions boring and have said that they fail to address the complexity of issues addressed in real world settings.

6

Aarons (2005) explored the role of attitudes and organizational culture in the acceptance of innovative treatments and the uptake of evidence-based psychotherapy practices. Aarons noted that dissemination efforts may be either impeded or facilitated by providers' individual characteristics, such as beliefs about protocols and personality characteristics like openness and innovativeness (Aarons, 2004, 2005). Aarons found that a general willingness to experiment with new procedures and tasks was associated with more positive attitudes toward evidence-based practice (Aarons, 2005). To facilitate examination of attitudes toward evidence-based practice of individual providers, Aarons developed the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS; Aarons, 2004) that included questions such as, "I like to use new types of therapy/interventions to help my clients," and "Clinical experience is more important than using manualized therapy/interventions." Specific to evidence-based practices of mental health professionals specializing in trauma, Gray, Elhai, and Schmidt (2007) investigated 318 individuals who completed a web-based survey. In their assessment of barriers to both learning and practicing evidence-based practice they found that the most highly endorsed barrier was "Insufficient time to learn" (38.7% of respondents) followed by "Difficulty finding the time to attend training seminars" (37.7%), "Lack of generalizability of the literature to my client population" (36.4%), "Prohibitive expense of training seminars" (35.0%), and "Inability to apply research findings to patients with unique characteristics" (29.3%). These findings are reflective of other reported research findings, specifically, that a sizeable proportion of clinicians report that manuals restrict clinical innovation and are impediments to idiographically-responsive treatment (e.g., Salloum, Sulkowski, Sirrine, & Storch, 2009). When the researchers analyzed responses of clinicians holding negative views toward evidence-based practice, they found the following common complaints: "Lack of generalizability of the literature to my patient population," "Inability to apply research findings to individual patients with unique characteristics," "Objections to EBP movement", and "Lack of interest."

Attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTSD. There is no established body of literature on therapist attitudes toward the use of a couple therapy modality to treat individuals with PTSD. However, literature exists on the impact of PTSD on close significant others (e.g., Davidson, Hughes, Blazer & George, 1991; Whisman, Sheldon, & Goering, 2000). For example, those with PTSD have been found to be just as likely to marry as those without PTSD but are somewhere between 3 to 6 times more likely to divorce (Davidson, Hughes, Blazer, & George, 1991; Kessler et al., 1995). In a community sample study of nearly 5,000 Canadian couples that looked at associations between marital distress and mental health problems, a diagnosis of PTSD was associated with a 3.8 times greater likelihood of relationship distress (Whisman, Sheldon, & Goering, 2000). Authors have also written about couple-level phenomena that are said to occur when one partner has PTSD, such as secondary or vicarious traumatization (whereby efforts to support and empathize with the PTSD-affected partner lead the supporting partner to develop PTSD symptoms; Maloney, 1988; Solomon et al., 1992) and PTSD-related caregiver burnout (e.g., Manguno-Mire et al., 2007). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that clinicians hold a range of attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTSD, some positive and some negative, and that these attitudes are associated with uptake of a couple-based intervention to treat PTSD. Associations between prior training and psychotherapy uptake. Literature on the effect of prior training experiences on uptake of new treatments can be divided into two larger categories, literature on the impact of predominant therapeutic orientation and literature on the impact of years of clinical experience. Each are considered below in turn. Therapeutic orientation. Addis and Krasnow (2000) found that clinicians' predominant theoretical orientation was linked to attitudes toward manualized treatments, with cognitive-behavioural clinicians holding more favourable views about manuals than psychodynamically-oriented clinicians (Addis & Krasnow, 2000). Likewise, in their study on attitudes toward and use of evidence-based practices of trauma professionals, Gray, Elhai, and Schmidt (2007) found that practitioners endorsing a predominantly 8

cognitive-behavioural orientation held more favourable views toward evidence-based practices than did practitioners endorsing a psychodynamic or other orientation. Gray and colleagues also divided practitioners into two groups based on their preferred trauma treatment strategy (i.e., a strategy based on available research findings such as trauma-focused CBT or a strategy associated with little compelling research-based evidence such as bioenergetics or nutritional approaches). They found that the prior group held more favourable views toward evidence-based practice than did the latter. These findings are in line with those of Markowitz, Manber, and Rosen (2008) from their study on the training of clinicians in Brief Supportive Psychotherapy (BSP). They assessed therapists' attitudes toward the therapy and explored whether therapists' predominant therapeutic orientation was predictive of more or less difficulty acclimating to BSP. One of their central hypotheses was that therapists with a predominantly CBT background would report greater frustration and less satisfaction with BSP than therapists from other backgrounds due to the greater theoretical and technical differences between their orientation and BSP. Indeed, they found that therapists with a CBT background reported more frustration and less satisfaction with the treatment, although the differences failed to meet statistical significance. They noted that their findings likely apply to the training of other types of interventions. Specifically, they noted that therapists learning interventions that diverge from their typical approach to treatment are likely to be more resistant to learn, and were likely to experience frustrations and apprehension at the start of training, but that these were surmountable challenges through effective training. Years of experience and prior training. Overall, the literature indicates that there is an indirect association between the number of years of clinician experience and positive attitudes toward evidencebased practice and manualized treatments (e.g., Addis & Krasnow, 2000; Clark, 1995; Margison et al., 2000; Taylor & Chang, 2008). Addis and Krasnow's (2000) analysis of predictors of attitudes toward treatment manuals found that a significant negative association between clinicians' years in practice and positive attitudes toward manualized therapies, a construct that has been correlated with greater uptake of 9

treatments) got increasingly positive. A similar negative association has been found between years since highest degree completed and positive attitudes toward manualized therapies (e.g., Addis & Krasnow, 2000; Addis, Wade, & Hatgis, 1999). Clarke (1995) noted that clinicians with more experience may be less likely to strictly adhere to a therapy protocol than less experienced clinicians. Clarke (1995) explained that experienced clinicians like to blend interventions from various protocols depending on how relevant the interventions seem to be for the client, so as to be maximally responsive to the client's needs (1995). The desire to be maximally responsive to the client may trump the desire to be maximally faithful to a protocol, thus undermining treatment integrity and uptake of an evidence-based manualized treatment. Perepletchikova and Kazdin (2005) suggested that a solid and extensive foundation of prior experience may result in a solidified approach to therapy and thus less flexibility and adherence to a new protocol. Margison and colleagues (2000) also stated that as therapists gain more experience, they tend to draw on aspects of various protocols and interventions depending on the client's presentation and needs. Thus, as years of experience increase and as clinicians' prior training gets more extensive, nonadherence to protocol may increase. In their review of issues in the dissemination of cognitive-behavioural therapies, Taylor and Chang (2008) also noted that therapists with extensive experience preferred to blend and combine various techniques in treatment rather than follow a prescribed protocol. In their year-long study on uptake of dynamic psychotherapy, Henry and colleagues (1993) examined the mediating effect of therapists' responses to training. They found that therapists in the study with more prior supervision were more reluctant to change from their normal style of clinical intervention to that being taught in the study. The researchers concluded that therapists with more extensive previous supervision may be more rigid and less open to learning and implementing new manualized protocols (Henry, Schacht, Strupp, Butler, & Binder, 1993).

10

Aarons' (2004, 2005) work also demonstrates that individual provider demographics are very important variables to account for and address when studying uptake and faithful implementation. In Aarons' study of predictors of uptake of evidence-based practice, he found that Intern status as opposed to Staff status was correlated with more positive attitudes toward the adoption of evidence-based practice. Aarons (2004) suggested that internship was a particularly advantageous window of time in clinicians' professional development in which to introduce evidence-based practice to individuals, due to this increased openness and flexibility.

11

The Present Study Overarching Goal The primary research question addressed in the study was: What is the role of individual provider characteristics in the uptake of CBCT for PTSD (Monson & Fredman, 2010)? Specifically, the study examined associations between specific individual provider characteristics and the individual providers' uptake of the CBCT for PTSD protocol following attendance of a workshop. The following characteristics were examined: attitudes toward manualized treatments; attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individual PTSD; prior training in couple therapy; prior training in cognitive-behavioural therapy for PTSD; years since highest degree earned; and predominant therapeutic orientation. Specific Hypotheses Attitudes. It was predicted that increasingly positive attitudes about manualized treatments and increasingly positive attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTSD would each independently be associated with increased uptake of the protocol. It was also predicted that there would be an interaction effect for the two attitudes such that increasingly positive attitudes toward manualized treatments in combination with increasingly positive attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD would predict greater uptake of the protocol. Prior training. It was hypothesized that prior training in couple therapy, or prior training in CBT for PTSD would predict increased uptake of the protocol. It was also hypothesized that there would be an interaction effect such that having both types of prior training would be associated with increased uptake. Predominant therapy orientation. It was hypothesized that a predominantly CBT orientation would be positively associated with increased uptake above and beyond other orientations. Years since highest degree was earned. It was hypothesized that the fewer the years since participants' highest degree was completed, the greater the uptake would be.

12

Method Participants Participants included 298 (103 male, 166 female, 29 unidentified) mental health clinicians serving U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, and Canadian Forces personnel who attended a CBCT for PTSD training in 2010. As shown in Table 1, the majority of clinicians were born between 1950 and 1979 and therefore between the ages of 40 and 69 years at the time they attended the training. The majority of clinicians were social workers or psychologists. Over 60% of the clinicians indicated that their predominant therapy orientation was cognitive-behavioural, and the balance identified their orientation as eclectic/integrative (16.2%), Rogerian/client-centered/supportive (6.3%), psychodynamic (4.9%), family systems (3.2%), interpersonal (1.8%), humanistic/existential (0.7%), biological (0.4%), and other (2.5%). All 298 clinicians completed a Pretreatment Survey immediately preceding the training; 247 (82.9%) clinicians completed the Posttreatment Survey immediately following the training, and 69 (23.2%) of clinicians completed the Follow-Up Survey 4 months after the training. The demographic and practice characteristics of those participants who completed the Follow-Up Survey were statistically compared with those who did not complete the Follow-up Survey to assess the generalizability of the results to those who participated in the CBCT for PTSD workshop more generally. The percentage of clinicians who completed the follow-up survey did not differ based on sex, 2 (2, N = 284) = 0.07, p = .97, age, two-sided Fisher's Exact test (N = 284) = 3.42, p = .79, profession, two-sided Fisher's Exact test (N = 284) = 2.52, p = .94, years since highest degree was completed, 2 (1, N = 281) = 0.01, p = .94, predominant therapy orientation,
2 (1, N = 276) = 0.07, p = .79, or prior training in couple therapy, 2 (1, N = 267) = 0.01, p = .94. There

was, however, a significant group difference for prior training in CBT for PTSD, 2 = (1, N = 267) = 4.07, p = .04, with clincians with prior training in CBT for PTSD being more likely to have completed the followup survey (24.4%) than clinicians without this prior training (11.5%). Given that there was only one group 13

difference among the seven demographic variables examined and the relevance of the specific sample of clincians in the study, it was decided that this difference would not be controlled for in the analyses.

Measures Surveys. Data were collected through three program evaluation surveys (see Appendices A, B, and C). The Pretraining Survey (see Appendix A) was given to clinicians in paper format immediately before the training began. The Posttraining Survey (see Appendix B) was given to clinicians in paper format immediately following the training. The Follow-Up Survey was given to participants 4 months following their training (see Appendix C). This survey was completed online using Qualtrics survey software (Qualtrics, 2010). Computation of "piecemeal protocol uptake" outcome variable. Piecemeal protocol uptake was defined as use of specific elements from the protocol rather than systematic use of the entire protocol. A continuous piecemeal protocol practice outcome variable was computed by summing the endorsement (yes/no) of 39 items on the Follow-Up Survey, derived from the CBCT for PTSD Fidelity Measure (Monson, Brown-Bowers, & Fredman, 2009). This fidelity measure identifies essential and specific interventions comprising the CBCT for PTSD protocol, and was adapted to assess the participants' endorsement of the use of the essential and specific interventions (yes/no). Scores range from 0 to 39; mean piecemeal protocol practice in the sample was 10.74 (SD = 11.08). Computation of "prescribed protocol uptake" outcome variable. Prescribed protocol uptake was defined as systematic use of the protocol per the clinician's manual. A categorical prescribed protocol practice variable was created by reviewing clinicians' responses to items on the Follow-up Survey asking about use of the protocol since attending the training, such as discussing the protocol with a colleague or clients, completing phase 1 of the treatment with a couple, or completing the entire protocol with a couple. If clinicians had at least discussed the protocol with a client or couple in the 4-month follow-up period, it was assumed that they had the intention of using the protocol as per the manual. As such, discussing the therapy with a client or couple was equated with prescribed protocol uptake for the present study. This was considered a reasonable threshold for prescribed protocol uptake, given the short time-span between the 18

training and Follow-Up Survey. Clinicians received either a "Yes" or "No" prescribed protocol practice coding based on their reported behaviour. More than half of clinicians (56.5%, n = 39) indicated that they had engaged in prescribed protocol practice and 43.5% (n = 30) indicated that they had not engaged in prescribed protocol practice. Computation of predictor variables. Clinicians' responses to the question of how many years it had been since they had completed their highest degree were recoded to simplify analyses (see Table 1 for the results to this question before categories were collapsed). The following three time categories were collapsed to form a "10 years or less" category: Less than a year ago, 1 to 5 years ago, and 6 to 10 years ago. In addition, the following two time categories were collapsed to form a "more than 10 years" category: 11 to 20 years and more than 20 years. The groups were roughly equal in size, with 55.2% (n = 155) of clinicians having completed their highest degree 10 years ago or less and 44.8% (n = 126) of participants having completed their highest degree more than 10 years ago. Clinicians' responses to the predominant therapy orientation question were recoded as per the specific hypotheses related to therapy orientation. To facilitate these comparisons the following categories were collapsed to form a nonCBT orientation category: Rogerian/client-centered/supportive, psychodynamic, interpersonal, humanistic/existential, biological, family systems, eclectic/integrative, and other. Nearly two thirds of clinicians (63%, n = 174) endorsed a predominantly CBT orientation and 37% (n = 102) endorsed a predominant therapy orientation that was not CBT (see Table 1). Clinicians were asked about prior training experiences in couple therapy and CBT for PTSD. About one-third of clinicians (34.1%, n = 91) indicated they had no prior training in couple therapy. Most clinicians (72.8%, n = 217) had received prior training in CBT for PTSD. In order to operationalize attitudes toward manualized treatments and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy as a modality to treat individual PTSD, nine items on the Posttraining Survey specifically inquired about these attitudes. Two items asked about views toward manualized treatments (e.g. "Most 19

couples' problems are too complex to treat with time-limited, manual-based treatments") and seven items assessed attitudes toward using a couple therapy format for the treatment of PTSD (e.g., "A PTSD-specific form of couple therapy could be a front-line treatment for PTSD," and "Couples' problems can be treated successfully when one of the partners has PTSD."). Results of the factor analysis on these items are reported below. Attitudes toward manualized treatments. Attitudes toward manualized treatments scores were computed for the 298 participants who completed the Posttraining Survey by summing the two items that loaded onto the Attitudes Toward Manualized Treatments factor that was predicted to emerge from the factor analysis. The maximum possible score was 8 (indicating a maximally positive attitude toward manualized treatments) and the minimum score was 0 (indicating a minimally positive attitude toward manualized treatments). Scores ranged from 0 to 8 (M = 1.47, SD = 1.74). Attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD. Attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD scores were computed for the 298 participants who completed the Posttraining Survey by summing the seven items that loaded on to the Attitudes Toward the use of Couple Therapy to Treat PTSD factor that was predicted to emerge from the factor analysis. The maximum possible score was 28 (indicating maximally positive attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD) and the minimum score was 0 (indicating minimally positive attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD). Scores ranged from 7 to 28 (M = 22.02, SD = 3.90). Statistical Analyses to Test Hypotheses Attitudes and uptake. Associations between attitudes (continuous variables) and piecemeal protocol uptake (continuous variable) were tested with two-tailed bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients. Associations between attitudes (continuous variables) and prescribed protocol uptake (dichotomous categorical variable) were tested with logistic regression analyses. The strength of these associations were characterized by conventions offered by Cohen (1988). Cases were excluded listwise. 20

In order to test for a possible interaction between the two continuous attitude variables and uptake, and consistent with recommendations by Aiken & West (1991), the attitude variables were first centered around their respective means. To test for an interaction between the two attitude variables and piecemeal protocol uptake, an interaction variable was created by multiplying scores for the two centered attitudes together. Next, hierarchical multiple linear regression was conducted with the following three predictors: attitudes toward manualized treatments, attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD, and the interaction term. Piecemeal protocol uptake was a continuous outcome variable. In order to test for an interaction between the two attitudes scales and prescribed protocol uptake, logistic regression was conducted with the following three predictors: attitudes toward manualized treatments, attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD, and the interaction term. Prescribed protocol uptake was a categorical (i.e., yes or no) outcome variable. Prior training, therapy orientation, years since highest degree was completed and uptake. Associations between prior training experiences and therapy orientation and piecemeal protocol uptake of CBCT for PTSD were tested using multiple linear regression analyses, with prior training and therapy orientation as categorical (i.e., yes or no) predictors and piecemeal protocol uptake scores as the continuous outcome variable. Pearson's Chi-square analyses were performed in order to assess associations between prior training experiences, therapy orientation and years since highest degree was completed and prescribed protocol uptake. Crosstabulation outputs from the Chi-square for prior training in CBT for PTSD and prescribed protocol uptake indicated that there were fewer than five frequencies in at least one of the cells, making it inappropriate to proceed with a Pearson's Chi-square interpretation of results, so the Fisher's two-sided Exact Test method was used to interpret results. Crosstabulation outputs from the Chi-squares for prior training in couple therapy, for therapy orientation and for years since highest degree was earned, and

21

prescribed protocol uptake indicated that there were at least five frequencies in each cell so proceeding with a Pearson's Chi-square statistic was appropriate. In order to test for an interaction between the two prior training variables and piecemeal protocol uptake, multiple linear regression was conducted with the following three predictors: prior training in couple therapy, prior training in CBT for PTSD, and their interaction. An interaction variable was created by multiplying scores for prior training in couple therapy and scores for prior training in CBT for PTSD together. In order to test for an interaction between the two prior training variables and prescribed protocol uptake, logistic regression was conducted with the following three predictors: prior training in couple therapy, prior training in CBT for PTSD, and their interaction term. The association between years since highest degree was completed and piecemeal protocol practice was tested with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with years since highest degree was completed as a categorical (i.e., 10 years or less, or more than 10 years) predictor variable, and piecemeal protocol practice as a continuous outcome variable.

22

Results Factor Analysis A principal component extraction method and a varimax rotation were employed to identify a factor solution. Following, a reliability analysis was performed for each of the two scales and internal consistency was examined using Cronbach's alpha. The factor analytic procedures revealed that the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) was 0.72 and well above the .5 cutoff, indicating there was adequate sample size to proceed. Bartlett's Test of Sphericity was significant, 2 (36) = 647.99, p < .001, indicating there were some relationships between the variables and that the correlation matrix was not an identity matrix. Two factors were initially extracted. The first factor had an Eigenvalue of 3.20 and explained 35.6% of the variance, and the second factor had an Eigenvalue of 1.83 and explained an additional 20.3% of the variance. Examination of the Scree Plot suggested a two-factor solution that explained 55.87% of the variance. Items loaded as predicted onto the two factors, with the exception of one item that loaded equally onto both factors. This item was deleted and the factor analysis was rerun. This resulted in a KMO of 0.71, above the .5 cutoff. Bartlett's Test of Sphericity was significant, 2 (28) = 658.07, p < .001, indicating there were relationships between the variables and that analyses could proceed as planned. Two factors were extracted. The first factor had an Eigenvalue of 3.11 and explained 38.9% of the variance, and the second factor had an Eigenvalue of 1.80 and explained an additional 22.5% of the variance. Examination of the Scree Plot suggested a two-factor solution that explained 61.4% of the variance. Items loaded as predicted onto the two factors, resulting in the following two attitude factors: Attitudes Toward Manualized Treatments and Attitudes Toward the use of Couple Therapy to Treat PTSD (see Table 2).

Reliability analyses revealed that the alpha coefficient for Attitudes Toward Manualized Treatments was good at .90 and the alpha coefficient for Attitudes Toward the use of Couple Therapy to Treat PTSD was good at .80. No substantial increases in Cronbach's alpha would have been obtained if any of the items on either of the two scales were deleted. Hypothesis I.A. Contrary to hypothesis, the association between attitudes toward manualized treatments and piecemeal protocol uptake was not statistically significant, r = .14, p (two-tailed) = .30. Similarly, attitudes toward manualized treatments did not significantly predict prescribed protocol uptake (See Table 3). Hypothesis I.B. Contrary to hypothesis, the association between attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD and piecemeal protocol uptake was not statistically significant, r = .06, p (two-tailed) = .67. Similarly, attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD did not significantly predict prescribed protocol uptake (See Table 4). Hypothesis I.C. Results of the hierarchical multiple linear regression predicting piecemeal protocol uptake indicated that step 1 in the model containing the main effects of attitudes toward manualized treatments and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD did not significantly predict piecemeal protocol uptake (See Table 5). The final model, which contained both the main effects and the interaction effect, also did not significantly predict piecemeal protocol uptake. However, examination of the coefficients in step 2 of the model showed that the interaction term approached significance (p = .11), as did attitudes toward manualized treatments (p = .05), as predictors of piecemeal protocol uptake scores. The simple main effects were plotted in order to interpret the interaction, and it was found that, as attitudes toward manualized treatments got more positive and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTSD got more positive, piecemeal protocol uptake scores decreased (see Figure 1).

Results from the logistic regression indicated that the interaction effect of the attitudes variables did not significantly predict prescribed protocol uptake (See Table 6). Hypothesis II.A. Results from the multiple linear regression indicated that prior training in couple therapy did not significantly predict piecemeal protocol uptake (See Table 7).

The percentage of clinicians who reported prescribed protocol uptake did not differ based on prior training in CBT for PTSD, 2 (1, N = 59) = 1.18, p = .28. Hypothesis II.C. Results of the linear regression indicated that there was no significant interaction between the two types of prior training variables in predicting piecemeal protocol uptake (See Table 9). Results from logistic regression also indicated that there was no significant interaction between the two types of prior training in predicting prescribed protocol uptake (See Table 10). Hypothesis III. Results from multiple linear regression indicated that therapy orientation did not significantly predict piecemeal protocol uptake (See Table 11). The proportion of clinicians who reported prescribed protocol uptake did not differ based on therapy orientation, 2 (1, N = 62) = 0.25, p = .62.

Hypothesis IV. Years since highest degree was completed was not significantly associated with piecemeal protocol uptake, F (1, 61) = 1.76, p = .190, ² = .028.

Discussion The goals of the study were to identify individual provider characteristics associated with greater uptake of CBCT for PTSD in order to inform dissemination efforts for the protocol. In general, specific attitudes did not predict uptake when considered on their own and there were no statistically significant interaction effects for the attitudes. However, an approaching significant interaction was observed between specific attitudes, such that therapists with increasingly positive attitudes toward manualized treatments and increasingly positive attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTSD had lower piecemeal protocol uptake. It was also found that a number of prior training and experience variables such as prior training in couple therapy, years since highest degree was completed, and therapeutic orientation were not associated with uptake. A strength of this study was that uptake was conceptualized not only as prescribed protocol adherence, but also as piecemeal use of specific interventions comprising the protocol. Attitudes as Predictors of Uptake A significant positive correlation between clinicians' positive attitudes toward manualized treatments and implementation of CBCT for PTSD in both a piecemeal and prescribed fashion was hypothesized. Research has established that clinicians hold a range of attitudes toward standardized protocols and that negative attitudes can act as barriers to dissemination and implementation (Salloum, Sulkowski, Sirrine, & Storch, 2009). Likewise, it was predicted that clinicians with increasingly positive attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD would be more likely to implement CBCT for PTSD in both a piecemeal and prescribed fashion. Contrary to hypothesis, none of these individual associations between attitudes and uptake were significant. The prediction that the interaction between attitudes toward manualized treatments and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD would predict uptake was not statistically supported. There was a finding approaching significant in the prediction of piecemeal uptake. It is likely that a small effect was present but that the low statistical power of the tests resulted in non-significant findings. The 39

approaching significant finding suggested that as clinicians' attitudes toward manualized therapies became more positive, clinicians with more positive attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individual PTSD had lower piecemeal protocol practice scores. Thus, clinicians with increasingly positive attitudes toward manualized treatments and increasingly positive attitudes toward the use of a couple therapy format for treating individuals with PTSD were less likely to engage in piecemeal protocol practice. It is important to note that these interactions likely did not reach traditional levels of statistical significance because of inadequate power. As Aiken and West (1991) indicate, interactions often run the risk of being underpowered. This interaction suggests that clinicians with more positive views about the ability of a disorder-specific couple therapy modality to treat individuals with PTSD and more positive views toward manaulized therapies are less likely to pick and choose different interventions from the protocol. Rather, they seem more likely to systematically use the protocol as prescribed. Previous research on the association between attitudes toward manualized treatments and uptake has found that negative beliefs about manualized treatments impede subsequent uptake (e.g., Addis & Krasnow, 2000; Addis, Wade, & Hatgis, 1999). Clinicians in the current study were asked questions specifically eliciting attitudes toward manualized therapies, including the degree to which clinicians believed standardized treatments were able to address complex clinical issues. The lack of significant bivariate associations suggest that uptake of a specific manualized protocol (i.e., CBCT for PTSD) can occur even in the presence of more negative attitudes toward manualized therapies in general. This finding was not likely due to insufficient power given the relatively small size of the association. It has been suggested in the literature that those disseminating psychotherapies should take into account and address the possibly negative attitudes toward manualized treatments (Taylor & Change, 2008), however, findings from the current study are encouraging in that it appears that people's attitudes toward manualized treatments in general do not necessarily predict uptake of a specific standardized psychotherapy. Perhaps it is more important to take into account attitudes toward manualized treatments in the context of 40

other attitudes (e.g., attitudes toward the use of a couple therapy modality to treat individual psychopathology) than attitudes toward manualized treatments in isolation. No significant interaction was found between the two attitudes predicting prescribed protocol uptake. Thus, clinicians with increasingly positive views toward manualized treatments and increasingly positive views toward the use of couple therapy to treat individual PTSD were no more or less likely to engage in systematic implementation of CBCT for PTSD. This finding is encouraging because it suggests that clinician's attitudes about doing trauma-focused work in a couples context in conjunction with their attitudes toward manualized treatments are not barriers to dissemination and uptake of CBCT for PTSD. If attitudes toward manualized therapies and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat PTSD don't predict uptake, then what might? Aarons (2004; 2005) stressed that, along with attitudes toward standardized protocols, other individual personality characteristics such as openness and innovativeness may be important factors in the uptake of manualized therapy practice. Although Aarons found that these characteristics were associated with more positive attitudes toward manualized treatments (2005), individual characteristics such as openness and innovativeness are likely to be associated with uptake. Specifically, a willingness to learn novel psychotherapies and a willingness to incorporate new treatments into clinical practice may be a better predictor of uptake than attitudes toward specific formats or modalities of therapy. It is also possible that other, more pragmatic factors have a greater effect on uptake and implementation of CBCT for PTSD. For example, support from management, time to learn a new protocol, access to posttraining resources (e.g., case consultation, refresher courses), and peer support may matter more than individual provider attitudes (Karlin et al., 2010). Prior Training and Years since Highest Degree was Completed as Predictors of Uptake It was predicted that clinicians who had received prior training in either couple therapy or CBT for PTSD would be more likely to implement the CBCT for PTSD protocol following the training; however, this was not found to be the case. Neither prior training in couple therapy nor prior training in CBT for 41

PTSD were independently associated with increased uptake of the protocol. Likewise, no significant interaction of the two prior trainings was identified. Although the findings from the present study on the association between prior training experiences and uptake are not consistent with the predicted hypotheses, they are nevertheless encouraging in terms of suspected necessary or facilitating factors in uptake. It was thought that clinicians without training in specific modalities would be less inclined to implement CBCT for PTSD and results opposed this assumption. This means that clinicians may benefit equally from attendance at CBCT for PTSD psychotherapy trainings, irrespective of prior training history. It was also predicted that the more years of experience clinicians had going into the training, the less likely they would be to engage in piecemeal and prescribed implementation of the protocol, but this was not found. Although group differences in piecemeal protocol uptake were not significantly different, the mean piecemeal protocol uptake score was higher in the group of clinicians with more than 10 years since completing their highest degree than in the group with 10 or fewer years since they had completed their highest degree, with an effect size difference of d = -0.33. This pattern is congruent with previous research findings that the more years of experience a clinician has, the less likely they are to implement a protocol as prescribed. Clarke (1995) suggests that the more experience a clinicians has, the more likely they are to integrate elements of various protocols into their psychotherapy with clients as opposed to strictly adhere to a single protocol. Taylor and Change (2008) also found that therapists with more experience tend to utilize various tools and techniques in treatment rather than strictly adhere to a single protocol. Therapy Orientation as a Predictor of Uptake It was predicted that clinicians with a predominantly CBT orientation would be more likely to implement the protocol than nonCBT oriented therapists. This hypothesis was not supported and contrary to previous research findings that therapists who identify as primarily CBT in orientation hold more favourable

42

views toward manualized treatments than therapists who identify as being either psychodynamic or "other" in orientation (Addis & Krasnow, 2000; Gray, Elhai, & Schmidt, 2007). Limitations and Conclusion A limitation of the study was the relatively low response rate for the Follow-Up Survey, which resulted in a problem of low power to detect significant findings. Specifically, an approaching significant interaction was found for attitudes toward manualized therapies and attitudes toward the use of a couple therapy format to treat individuals with PTSD. It is possible that with a greater follow-up response rate and thus increased power, this interaction would have been found to be significant. Additional efforts should be made in future studies to increase the response rate and remedy this problem. It is possible that both prescribed and piecemeal uptake were less among the clinicians who did not complete the Follow-Up Survey than among the clinicians who did, thus findings may be biased and should be interpreted with caution. Participants in the current study were a fairly homogenous sample in terms of work setting. All clinicians served U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, or were Canadian Forces personnel. Thus, results may not be generalizable beyond this specific context. Results may have been different had the sample included clinicians from a greater variety of workplace settings (e.g., private practice, hospitals, private institutions etc..). If a clinician had 100% piecemeal protocol uptake, the measures did not allow the investigators to determine if this meant that the clinician (a) used all of the essential elements of the protocol, as prescribed by the manual, with a single dyad ("prescribed protocol practice"), (b) used all of the essential elements of the protocol, with a single dyad, but not as prescribed by the manual, or (c) used all of the essential elements of the protocol, but not all with the same dyad. Further questions should be added to the measures to allow for these distinctions to be made.

43

Despite these limitations, findings suggest that it may be useful to assess certain individual provider characteristics when engaging in dissemination efforts for CBCT for PTSD. Although an interaction between specific attitudes (i.e., attitudes toward manualized treatments and attitudes toward the use of couple therapy to treat individuals with PTSD) was not statistically significantly associated with uptake of the protocol 4 months following attendance at a workshop, it is likely that this was due to small sample size for the follow-up survey and that a greater number of participants may have revealed a significant interaction. Results also suggest that a number of individual provider characteristics, such as therapy orientation and prior training in couple therapy or prior training in CBT for PTSD are not associated with uptake and as such may not need to be factored into dissemination strategies. In order to narrow the gap between psychotherapy research and psychotherapy practice, there is a need for efficacious and effective dissemination strategies. And, in order to design and execute effective dissemination efforts, there is a need for systematic and empirical investigation of post-workshop practice patterns. Research efforts, like the present study, offer pieces of the empirical puzzle to help design evidence-based dissemination strategies that can ultimately increase the chances that patients can receive the efficacious therapies that we have to offer.

SECTION # 5: General Opinions
The following questions ask about your feelings about various types of therapy and about using new types of therapy, interventions, or treatments. "Manualized therapy, treatment, or intervention" refers to any intervention that has specific guidelines and/or components that are outlined in a manual and/or that are followed in a structured or predetermined way.
Please circle the answer that best describes the Not at To a slight all extent to which you agree with each item. extent

To a moderate extent To a great extent To a very great extent

I like to use new types of therapy/ interventions to help my clients. Treatment research cannot be generalized to real-world clinical settings. Clinical experience is more effective than specific manualized therapy techniques. PTSD can be treated successfully for the majority of people in the general population. Couples' problems can be treated successfully for the majority of couples in the general population.

PTSD can be treated successfully in the majority of the patients I treat. Couples' problems can be treated successfully in the majority of cases I treat. Couple therapy should be offered as part of a treatment plan for PTSD. Couples' problems can be treated successfully when one of the partners has PTSD. Couple therapy is more complex to deliver than individual therapy. General couple therapy can improve PTSD.
