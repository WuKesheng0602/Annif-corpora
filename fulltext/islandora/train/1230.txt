ABSTRACT
Title of Thesis: PERFORMANCE DRIVEN DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION FOR MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION USING STABILITY IN COMPETITION

Thesis Submitted By: Summit Sehgal, Master of Applied Science, 2011 Optimization Problems Research and Application Laboratory (OPR-AL) Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University

Multi Parametric Design Space Exploration (DSE) for optimal micro-architecture synthesis is an extremely complex yet crucial stage in embedded systems development. Often it is very time complex to find the best suitable configuration to map the inherently contradictory performance parameters into systems silicon real estate. Owing to its exponentially exploding design space and multi way combinatorial mapping, DSE has proven to be notoriously hard and intractable for VLSI CAD tools. The presented work introduces a highly scalable and generalized analytical approach to identify the best configuration of systems architecture while maintaining prime accuracy resolution. This DSE approach coupled with Stability in Competition principles has been applied to a number of well known benchmark High Level Synthesis (HLS) applications, with an impressive 71.80% aggregate speedup and results being more pronounced for larger design space HLS applications.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Overview
For the design of modern embedded systems, high data processing performance and low power consumption numbers play the most important role [11,25,33,4,30,12]. The latest pursuit of converging data applications and ever increasing availability of silicon real estate per square inch has made the optimized selection of system resources increasingly important. The objective performance gains with aggressive parallelization and clocking at higher frequencies is becoming archaic; the need of modern reconfigurable systems is to adapt dynamically to reflect the changing operational conditions onto the systems micro-architecture. A typical embedded system development from conceptualization to physical realization goes through a series of steps and abstraction stages with each stage revealing more detailed and relevant information to the succeeding stage[14,22]. This kind of hierarchal and modular top-down design implementation is becoming the universal de facto industry standard [17,10,21,13] for complex real time embedded application development for its predictable design flow and information traceability. Fig. 1 shows the overview of typical top-down embedded systems design flow stages along with the abstraction stages from the behavioral/algorithm level to structural/physical level.

High Level Synthesis coupled with DSE effectively bridges the gap between behavioral and structural description of a systems micro-architecture [13,12]. This exposes a major design challenge: how to efficiently search and arrive at the best suitable systems configuration in practical time lines while maintaining prime solution accuracy given its exponentially exploding design space and multi way output-input combinatorial mapping. Design Space Exploration (DSE) can effectively address this
2

important design stage to arrive at suitable systems micro architecture configuration. DSE yields maximal advantage when applied at the initial stages of the system design but is rarely exploited to its full potential for the lack of implementation information available in the early design stages. The next sub-section gives an introduction on Design Space exploration.

1.2 Design Space Exploration Overview
Design Space Exploration is a set of framework and efficient search strategies to overcome the design space complexities. As the design space variables can be combine in a combinatorial manner, the design space candidate solution set variants grows exponentially. A random or an exhaustive search through an unorganized design space can take infinite time to arrive at an acceptable solution even for a mediocre size application. Therefore Design Space Exploration looks at a set of tools and mathematical/ algorithmic search strategies to limit the design space inherent complexity. The problem of efficient design space exploration compounds if the subjected application poses totally different characteristics along various objectives of a multi-objective optimization problems. The selection of the optimal system configuration given a number of contradictory performance requirements poses an imposing design problem. Advanced Design Space Exploration techniques can provide solutions to this complex problem. Typically, DSE encompasses design space modeling and performance evaluation, system level tradeoffs to most effectively capture the targeted application in silicon real estate [11,13,5,7,36,12]. Although effective, DSE is often cursed by high dimensions of the exponentially exploding design space for practical size applications with an enormous amount of architectural configurations possible for each modular implementation. As each of the possible system architectural configurations characterizes itself with varying performance space relationship, it soon becomes beyond human comprehension to evaluate

and perform wise resource utilization and system level trade-offs to achieve the desired operational characteristics. This research develops an efficient, structured and traceable DSE technique that makes it possible to perform system level evaluations and considerate architectural candidate selection from a large pool of probable candidate solutions. DSE is thus one of the most imperative and beneficial phases of embedded project development, leveraging maximal tradeoffs and performance gain benefits, especially when applied at the early stages of system development. Fig. 2 shows the block level view of the proposed DSE exploration framework. The figure shows different phases of DSE exploration including performance estimation; candidate set generation; spacewalk (DSE Explorer) and optimization (DSE Optimizer) strategies as will be discussed in detail in the Design Exploration chapter. Space walk tools are designed to automatically generate possible design configurations variants for the given high level application task [36,34,19]. The DSE explorer takes the input from the Space Walk tools and decides on the direction and the best possible way for further exploration. The DSE Optimizer subjects the possible design configurations to the systems constraints and the bounding
4

conditions. The DSE Optimizer also decides on the suitability of a particular design configuration to the others. The DSE Optimizer also consists of the terminating condition of the exploration loop which, when met or exceeded, terminates the exploration process. The proposed DSE optimizer in the presented research also incorporates a novel design technique that decides the order of design variable exploration as well as the extent of local resource exploitation.

1.3 Related Work
Design Space Exploration (DSE) techniques for multi-objective optimization problems have been an active area of research, which is receiving even more importance for its power aware high level synthesis applications. In recent times extraction and evaluation of the pareto optimal [19,33,7,17,36,12] design points have emerged as the most promising and time efficient way to overcome the design space complexities. In [7], the authors have developed Pareto Front Arithmetic (PFA) techniques to explore very large design space in a time efficient manner. Their method exploited the hierarchal problem structure for exploring the set of pareto-optimal design solutions. The similar approach has been developed by authors in [2], suggesting a few superior design points suffice the optimal variant selection from a large search space. A slightly different approach by the researchers in [17] have suggested the importance of order in design space exploration, which helps in design space feasibility studies and deciding the preference among various pareto-optimal design points. Although the authors in [2,17] have established the importance and applicability of pareto-optimal design set in selection and search for suitable design solution, their developed methodologies lack the generalized analytical formulation to support the underlying HLS principles. This research addresses the underlying analytical framework with
5

Priority Factors (PF) that can rigorously be applied to large design space problems. Additionally, the presented work develops an analytically exact method to utilize the most suitable range of the ordered design space variables making the search more accurate in terms of solution resolution, faster, as well as more easily traceable on to the design space configurations. Another noteworthy approach based on pareto-optimal design configuration is developed by authors in [36], addressing the multi-dimensional output-input space mapping technique to extract the pareto-optimal design points for analog circuit topologies. Although the research showed promising results in selection of optimal design variants in performance space it fails to trace back the performance space parameters to the design space variables, thus making the mapping exhaustive. In [18], the authors have employed evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) to yield the non dominated design points for the solution front selection and progression through an unarranged design space. Their research shows very impressive results but needs manual intervention converting the HLS problem into chromosomes representation as well as setting the mutation and cross over rate parameters for optimum performance, which can get challenging for large design set problems. The use of GA has also been suggested by authors in [7] for DSE framework and high level data path synthesis with inspiring results. Another probabilistic speculation technique has been put forward by authors in [2] for control flow intensive HLS applications for resource allocation and selection to meet the dynamic in loop performance requirements. In [8,32] authors have tried to exploit the statistical information to trace the DSE process. In yet another approach [17], authors have deployed Architectural Configuration Graphs (ACG) and constrained Control Flow Data Graph (CFDG) to address the architectural variant analysis and selection of optimal variants with primal dual optimization technique. Their results shows a very significant speed up in design space exploration but however fails to address the intricacies of partially

6

arranged design space and lacks the generalized analytical formulations that can be applied rigorously to large design space problems with ease. In recent times Support Vector Machines (SVM) are also finding increasing attention from researchers in systems automation domains. Authors in [36,18,23] have attempted SVM, for feature set selection at transistor level analog design and optimization studies. The technique shows very promising prospects for non-linear design space exploration but would need further research in the coming years for system level HLS applications. Another approach, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been suggested by authors in [3,37] using fuzzy logics to address the DSE complexity with inspiring results. Thus, DSE for HLS is a very rich and diverse topic owing to its ever increasing importance in system level design. The presented research work is based upon design space organization and feasibility studies [6,10,33], which will provide a comprehensive and thorough design space exploration framework for automated high level synthesis of DSP applications. The presented work will arrange the design space in the priority factor order based upon exact mathematical formulation of the performance parameters. The partially arranged design space will be traversed in an efficient manner along the pareto-optimal design points while parsing away redundant/ dominated regions of the design space.

Chapter 2 Preliminaries
This chapter presents the background information for the presented research work. Theoretical background on High Level Synthesis (HLS), formalization of Multi-Objective Optimization Problem, performance space modeling and the relevance of DSE in the presented research context are addressed. This chapter addresses the HLS theoretical background, multi-objective optimization problem formulation and related topics on performance space modeling in details.

2.1 Theoretical Background on High Level Synthesis
High Level Synthesis (HLS) is automated design process that converts the algorithmic behavioral specification of an application/ task to its equivalent circuit structure /system architecture [1,9,20,28,30,35]. The starting point of HLS synthesis is the algorithm defined as a function or some programming format. The function is then analyzed and subjected to performance requirements and the

limiting/ budgeting constraints to arrive at a suitable architecture configuration that behaves in the way as described by the application function and meets the performance/ budgeting constraints. HLS includes System design level tasks including behavioral specifications, task and data structure determination/ break-down, Design Space Exploration and achievable performance estimation, determination of suitable architectural variant that meets all the objective constraints, library module allocation to specific task(s), scheduling, binding and multiplexing of resources to achieve a system that replicates the application task behavior. System design from conceptualization to physical realization goes through a series of steps and abstraction stages with each stage revealing more detailed and relevant information to the succeeding stage. High Level Synthesis (HLS) bridges the gap between the behavioral description and the RTL level structural model of a system. Fig. 3 shows the various stages of the System design depicted in the form of Y-Chart. The three axes represent the Behavioral (Algorithmic), Structural (Architecture) and Physical (Geometrical) domains of system design. The Behavioral level specification is the system description in the form of function or code, the structure of the system follows the system behavior and incorporates the features to accommodate and take into account the design performance and limiting constraints. The
10

physical domain is the actual in-silicon implementation of the circuit at the gate level. All these three process are closely inter-related and the circuit/system design is subjected to gradual and necessary verification stages in design hierarchy for the optimal design cycle of development. Typically in system design flow, the application tasks behavioral description is converted into pseudo-algorithms, which are realized as systems micro-architectural components, programmable links, i/o and memory components. An optimized micro-architecture designed for a specific application should reflect the following important features: a) Work load specifications: This is the typical behavioral description of the application algorithms and associated data structures of the embedded system under development. The tasks are mapped unto the library modules/member elements which make up the system data path circuitry. The data path works under the timing and close co-ordination signals originating from the module Control Unit. b) Constrained Specifications: These are the qualitative measures that define the modular performance requirements and budgeting constraints including speed/throughput, worst latency, area and power restrictions etc. c) Component Library: These include the low level modules and functional operators that implement the desired behavior on the data. Component library can include functional operator modules, interfaces, memory, multiplexing and glue logics forms the primitive components and topology libraries available for system level design

2.2 Multi-Objective Optimization:
Multi Objective Optimization belongs to the combinatorial class of problems with more than one objective to be satisfied simultaneously. The parameterized objectives are invariably contradictory in nature leading to the conditions of infeasibility and sub-optimality of a solution. Often, binding cost function(s) is used as a quantitative measure for ascertaining the wellness of a particular solution towards the desired objectives. As the multi-objective optimization problems are combinatorial in nature, the problems can have a range of non-dominated local solutions, formally known as pareto-optimal solution sets. A global optimal solution is the candidate solution with most desirable cost function characteristics among all the objective function parameters. Formally, a multi-objective optimization problem can be represented as a multi constrained minimization/ maximization problem [15,26] as shown below:

Where, bi > 0 i {1,....., m  q} and aij  0 i {1,....., m  q} , j {1,....., n}. Here each of the m constraints of family (1) are called knapsack constraints, while each of the q constraints of family (2) can be interpreted as demand constraints. This specialized case of Knapsack problems and is also formally known as the multi-demand multi-constrained knapsack problem (MDMKP) [25], which is in fact the nature of DSE Optimization problems. Later in this work, a thorough DSE exploration framework will be developed to solve the MDMKP problem efficiently and accurately from an HLS point of view.

2.3 Performance Space Modeling:
The idea of performance space modeling is to provide a quick estimate of achievable performance parameters for a candidate design solution [24,29,31]. This is a kind of experimental simulation technique which extends the scope of conventional simulation toolset by incorporating additional features warranted for solving optimization problems in time and space efficient manner. The most distinguishable features of performance space modeling techniques from conventional simulation and modeling tool set include the creation of feasible design space configurations and determining the best way to traverse the generated design space while looking for the optimal candidate solution set. Thus the main objectives of performance space modeling technique(s) include maintaining good solution tractability and prime solution accuracy while maintaining low overall time complexity. A comprehensive list of various prevalent performance modeling techniques can be found in [10]. The presented work is limited to the top down constrained space modeling technique, which has proven to be far superior to any other contemporary design and modeling technique for its hierarchal, modular and predictable exploration characteristics. Fig. 4 shows a multi dimensional output-to-input mapping model where a set of performance space specifications are mapped back to the resource set R1, R2, Rn in more than one possible way. This multi-way mapping of the subject output attribute onto the input variable space in more than one possible way is a very typical combinatorial problem characteristic. Only one of the possible combinations of these multi-way mapping provides a superior design configuration while the rest are dominated by the superior solution set. The proposed DSE framework restricts the solution front from exploring the redundant and dominated regions of the search space, and thus keeps the progressing

13

Figure 4. Illustration of multi way many to many output input mapping relationships in performance space to design space

solution along pareto-optimal wave front. For example as shown in Fig. 4, variant 1 and variant 3 have equivalent values in one of the performance space parameter ,, but corresponds to totally different magnitude when mapped to some other performance space parameter ,,. Thus selection of optimal architectural variant involves prudent tradeoffs between different performance space parameters which involve power consumption, speed of execution, area, cost etc. The combinatorial nature of DSE problems along with budgeting constraint specifications and the inherent discreet integer programming characteristics of system design makes the process of finding a solution very time consuming and often untraceable. This work will develop a time efficient and accurate design space exploration strategy while addressing the above discussed design issues and complexities pertaining to one of many mapping possibilities.

14

2.4 Motivation for the Research
The motivation behind this research was to automate the much needed gap between the behavioral (algorithm) of a given design specification into structural (system architecture) for a given set of performance requirements/ constraints. As the embedded electronics technology matures the precise configuration of the system to most approximately reflect the exact behavioral model on system architecture without over-killing/ over-utilizing any of the resources is necessary. Moreover as embedded systems are custom designed any over/under utilization of the available resources adversely affects the power consumption numbers as well as the system cost. Therefore the precise mapping of the performance parameters on system architecture is essential. A brief summary of the research implications are listed below: 1) Design Automation: This approach can determine the optimal architecture configuration for a given set of library functions (modules), synthesis function (Algorithm) and

budgeting/performance constraints with minimal human intervention.

2)

Predictable Design Flow: This approach provides a rigorous set of mathematical models that can be applied to real world applications for repeated and expected design configurations in contrast to other heuristic approaches

3)

High Resolution Accuracy: As the proposed approach restricts the solution exploration front along the non-dominated/ non-overlapping regions of the design space the solution accuracy resolution is within the error range of least important/ least precise design space variable.

15

4)

Ease of Tradeoff Analysis: The most significant contribution of this approach is the ease with which the design space configuration can be modified to reflect the system level tradeoffs between different performance parameters.

5)

Lower Error Rate: As a secondary effect of predictable design flow and high degree of automation the extent of error in system level design and architecture tradeoff analysis can be minimized.

6)

Reusability: As the system design automation is highly modular and follows the conventional topdown hierarchal design approach, it is most suitable for existing design reusability. A systems tasks mapped on to lower abstraction stages can be subjected to plug-n-play IP cores or COTS elements.

Chapter 3 Proposed Design Space Exploration Framework
This chapter details the Design Space Exploration research framework to arrive at a suitable microarchitecture design configuration using Ordered Design Space and Stability in Competition principles. The ordered design space will help maintain solution feasibility whereas Stability in Competition will help restrict the solution front progression from exploring the dominated and redundant regions of the design space. A typical embedded system design consists of data processing elements such as hardware components, software modules, interconnecting logics including buses, multiplexing schemes, input-output, module to module interface logic along with clocking and power distribution infrastructure. Efficiently mapping the system high level requirements on low level system micro-architecture requires mapping a given high level task on a particular library module for the application under development. A random walk through the possible design configuration would be exhaustive and should be avoided for any practical
17

application. The arrangement of design resources/ library modules in order of their respective correspondence to design performance parameters helps traverse and search the optimal design configuration (variant) which is addressed as follows:

3.1 Design Space Organization:
The combinatorial nature of DSE problems makes the design space grow exponentially with the number of design variants. The presented work applies order and extent of resource exploration to keep the solution front within feasible and relatively improving marginal returns region(s). Fig. 5.a shows a hypothetical search through random design space with solution front traversing feasible and infeasible regions of multi dimensional performance space. The arrangement of resources makes the design space partially ordered [21,6] with nonlinearities occurring at the change of base variable along the partially ordered design space as shown in Fig. 5.b. This research will address the intricacies and the possible resolutions to overcome the shortcomings of partially ordered design space in the later sections. Establishment of order along design space variables serves a dual purpose in the proposed DSE strategy as described below:

a) Maintain solution feasibility: The solution feasibility is achieved by keeping the solution search within the limiting border variants in ordered design space. b) Reduce Time complexity: The ordered design space exploration helps restrict the solution front from exploring the redundant regions/ configurations of the design space.

18

Figure 5. Hypothetical search through (a) Unordered (b) partially ordered design space

This research addresses intricacies of partial arranged design space configurations and the efficient ways to traverse the non-dominated regions of the solution set coupled with multi-dimensional binary search techniques. Two basic design space arrangements, namely the local and global variable arrangement, are discussed for design space organization.

3.2 Local arrangement of design space variables:
The local arrangement of design space variables corresponds to performance space parameters in increasing or decreasing order of effect. The component set library composed of building block elements has a finite number of variants for each functional module variable Ri,j, where i=1,2,....m are the modules and j=1,2,....n are the number of variants of each functional module. The variants j {1,....., n} belonging to each functional module i {1,....., m} are characterized by specific attributes towards the scaled performance parameters. For example, a multiplier module can have number of available variants such as in booth, MAC, carry look-a-head etc. with each having characteristic attributes in terms of power consumption, area and speed rating. Some of these desirable attributes come at the cost of additional power rating and
19

area requirements. Since the HLS is inherently combinatorial in nature the combined effect of the composing design variables in a given variant configuration has to be considered for their respective performance characteristics.

3.3 Global arrangement of decision variables:
The global arrangement of decision variables help determine the relative order of importance of the decision space variables to the asserting performance space directive. The global decision variables are ordered as per their Priority Factors (PF), which are discussed below:

3.3.1) Priority Factor: The priority factor is a measure of the marginal resource contribution to the objective cost function normalized over its variant range. Mathematically the priority factor for a resource R 1, R2 .....Rn can be given as:

PF ( Rn) 

N Rn  K Rn N Rn

(3)

Where, N Rn  K Rn is the marginal contribution by the nth resource to the cost function and KRn is the absolute per unit performance (PPU) contribution of a design resource to the asserting cost function. Mathematically the PPU can be defined as:

PPU Ri 

P f ( R1 , R2 ....................Rn )   K Ri Ri Ri

(4)

20

Where Ri is the ith resource with n variants. In the presented DSE technique, the PF will help judge the relative influence of a particular resource to the optimization problem objective functions such as area, execution time, resource power consumption etc. The PF will be used to organize the decision variable space in order to provide the sense of direction to DSE solution front. The next section formulates and analyzes the necessary mathematical relationships for various performance measures including power, resource area and frame execution speed parameters.

3.3.2) Analysis for hardware area of the resources: Let the area of the resources be given as ,,A. Ri denotes the resources available for system designing; where 1<i<n. Rclk refers to the clock oscillator providing the necessary clock frequency to the system. The total area can be represented as the sum of all the resources used for designing the system. Therefore, for a system with ,,n functional resources the total area can be given as:

A   A( Ri )  ( N R1  K R1  N R 2  K R 2  ...  N Rn  K Rn )  A( Rclk )

(5)

where NRi represents the number of resource Ri and ,,KRi represents the area occupied per unit resource ,,Ri (1<=i<=n). Applying partial derivative to equation (5) with respect to NR1, NR2....NRn yields equation (6) and equation (7) respectively as shown below:

( ( N R1  K R1  ...  N Rn  K Rn )  A( Rclk ) A   K R1 N R1 N R1

(6)

A  K Rn N Rn

(7)

21

According to the ,,theory of approximation by differentials the change in the total area can be approximated by equation in (8):
dA  A A A  N R1   N R 2  ...  N Rn  A( Rclk ) N R1 N R 2 N Rn

(8)

Substituting equations (6) and (7) into equation (8) yields equation (9):
dA  (N R1  K R1 ) + ... + N Rn  K Rn + A( Rclk )

(9)

Where, N Rn  K Rn : Resource ,,Rn area contribution and A( Rclk ) : The clock variants area contribution to the cost objective. The equation above indicates the average change of area with respect to resource R1, R2 ....R n. Here the clock oscillator is a resource which contributes to the area occupied by the resources. The PF is a determining factor to judge the influence of a particular resource on the variation of the optimization parameters such as area, time of execution and power consumption. This PF will be used later in the DSE approach to organize the architecture design space consisting of design variants in increasing or decreasing order of magnitude. The Priority factor for the resources R1, R2 .....Rn can be given as:

PF ( Rn) 

N Rn  K Rn N Rn
A( Rclk ) N Rclk

(10)

PF ( Rclk ) 

(11)

The factor defined above determines average variation in area affected by the change of number of a certain resource.

22

3.3.3) Analysis for power consumption: For a system with ,,n functional resources the total power consumption ,,P' of the resources can be represented by equations (12) and (13):
P   ( N Ri  K Ri )  p c
i 1 n

(12)

 ( N R1  K R1  N R 2  K R 2  ..  N Rn  K Rn ). pc (13)
Where ,,NRi represents the number of resource Ri as mentioned before. ,,KRi represents the area occupied per unit resource Ri and ,,pc denotes the power consumed per area unit resource at a particular frequency of operation. By applying the partial derivatives to equation (13) the Priority Factor (PF) for power consumption can be given as follows:
N Rn  K Rn  ( p c ) max N Rn

PF ( Rn ) 

(14)

PF ( Rclk ) 

N R1  TR1  N R 2  TR 2  ..  N Rn  TRn  (pc ) N Rclk (15)

Where the symbols have their pre-defined meanings, the priority factors defined in equations (14) and (15) indicate the average change in the total power consumption with the change in number of resources at maximum clock frequency. For example, equation (19) indicates the change of total power consumption with the change in the number of that particular resource at maximum clock frequency. The priority factor will help to arrange the architectural variants of the design space in increasing or decreasing order of magnitude depending on the parameter of optimization. This further facilitates in the selection of the optimal design point that satisfies all the operating constraints and optimization requirement specified. In the above equations, maximum clock frequency was considered because at this
23

frequency the total power consumption is the maximum. Thus the change in number of a specific resource at maximum clock frequency will influence the change in the total power consumption ,,P' the most, compared to the change at other clock frequencies.

3.3.4) Analysis for Execution Time: According to the amount which different resources contribute to the change in execution time, Priority Factor (PF) for execution time can be defined as follows:
Max Min TRn  TRn PF ( Rn )  N Rn

(16)

Max Min TRclk  TRclk PF ( Rclk )  N Rclk

(17)

In equation (16) `TRnMax ' and `TRnMin ' are the maximum and minimum value of execution time when the resource ,,Rn is minimum and maximum respectively at maximum clock frequency. In equation (17), `TRclkMax' and `TRclkMin' are the maximum and minimum values of ,,execution time when the clock period is maximum and minimum respectively and all the available resources have the maximum value. The PF defined in equation (16) and (17) indicates the average change in execution time with the change in number of a particular resource and change in clock frequencies respectively.

3.4 Design Space Traversal:
The arrangement of resources/ design space variables in PF hierarchy renders the search space partially ordered. As such the solution front can get stuck in local minima while searching for the optimal design candidate solution. The purpose of this section is to critically analyze the overlapping domains
24

responsible for making the search space non linear. This section will also develop the necessary mathematical formulation to overcome the shortcomings of partially ordered design space and keep the solution front along the non dominated pareto-optimal design variants.

3.4.1 Root cause of the problem: Overlapping domains A decision variable Ri, can be used to contribute a discreet range of values over its constrained range of local variants towards an asserting cost function, as shown below:
max LocalDomain( Ri )  K Ri  N Ri

(18)

Where, KRi is the PPU contribution of resource Ri and N Ri is the maximum range of constrained domain of decision variable Ri. Fig 6.a shows a representative model of partially arranged decision variables in PF hierarchy, with each circle representing a decision variable and diameter corresponding to PPU. The local variants are uniformly distributed at the outer periphery of each decision variable. An arranged variable will have an overlapping local domain with the next variable in PF hierarchy if the following condition holds:
max min K Ri  N Ri  K R (i 1)  N R ( i 1)

max

(19)

Where KR(i+1) and

min NR ( i 1)

are the PPU and minimum number of variants of next variable PF(i+1), in

hierarchy. The overlapping domains are responsible for making the decision space partially ordered resulting in more than one correspondence for a specific cost function objective. Ideally each of the design space variables would have an independent one-to-one correspondence for the range of values it represents. This can only be possible if the local domains of decision variables just touch at the outer periphery resulting in a smooth transition as shown in Fig.6.b. A careful observation of the non

25

Figure 6 (a) the overlapping domains of partially arranged design variables in PF hierarchy (b) linearly ordered decision variables with restricted domains to avoid inferior dominated regions circle.

overlapping domain model of Fig 6.b reveals its resemblance to modern positional number systems to a certain extent. Although the DSE problem does not strictly comply with a standard positional system base or radix, this research utilizes the positional independent domain property and thus will try to make the search space linear and in proper order. Next section will develop the necessary mathematical relationships to achieve proper ordered design space. The perfectly ordered design space will be subjected to binary search algorithm for exploring the optimal design variant quickly and accurately.

3.4.2 Stability in Competition: An Overview Overlapping domains of the partially ordered design space variables are responsible for generating dominated one-to-many correspondences and in turn inferior regions of the search space. As such the DSE algorithms can easily get stuck in the local minimas along the design space traversal and will lack accuracy as well as speed due to redundant calculations. Therefore there is a need to make the search
26

space as linear as possible by restricting the extent of resource exploration in the superior non-dominated regions of the PF arranged design space. This objective closely correlates to the well established economics principle of stability in competition. This research will exploit the similarity of Stability in Competition principle to address the DSE problem in question. H. Hotelling [16] established in 1929 the principles of Stability in Competition between competing variables for the desired cost objective. Fig. 7 shows the act of self counter-balancing between two competing variables to the point of stability, where each variable counterbalances the others cumulative weight. The point of instantaneous balance marked by letter E in Fig. 7 signifies marginal stability between the competing variable set. Any disturbance at this point would make the other variable gradually follow the next variable to the point of next marginal stabilization. The presented HLS DSE Optimization problem displays similar behavior with competing design space variables trying to increase their per unit resource utilization over their local domain while keeping the solution front non-dominated. The resources in the solution set can only be used in discreet multiples and thus makes the HLS discreet integer optimization problem which also gets due consideration in this proposed DSE framework. The next section will develop the necessary mathematical relationships to restrict the extent of ordered resource exploration to keep the solution front non-dominated.

3.4.3 Limiting the Solution Bounds to Non Dominated regions of the Design Space: Let P be a sample performance space parameter directive being asserted on the design space variables R1, R2, ....., Rn. The relationship between the performance space and design space variables can be described as:

fP P  ( R1, R2,.....Ri ,....Rn)

(20)

27

where fp is an illustrative performance space parameter and can represent power, area or frame execution time. For the initial mathematical formulation only two variables are considered in the solution set and a summation function as the cost objective. The same analysis holds true for any complex outputinput function with any number of variables arranged in PF hierarchy. For a summation objective and dual variable, the performance objective can be given as:

P  N R1.K R1N R 2 .K R 2

(21)

where KRi is the per unit performance contribution of the resource Ri and can be calculated as:
P  K R1 R R  R1 Or,
P  K Ri R R Ri (22)

The next sub-section defines the absolute and compounded average of the objective function P over the design variables R1 and R2. This analysis establishes the bounds on the solution space.

Figure 7. Illustration of balancing conditions between dual competing variables. The co-ordinates represent the decision variable local variants and the point E represents point of balance. The system traverse through R1 and R2 variants till the point of balance reached at E. the curves through balance point E shows the maximal non dominated rage of R2 28and R1 respectively.

The design space exploration is optimally mapped on the design space variables between these defined bounds. Assuming R2 has greater per unit resource contribution than resource R1 towards the sample performance space directive fP, the absolute and compounded cost objective function of design variables R1 and R2 can be defined as:

a) Absolute Function: The cost performance directive as an independent function of design space variables provides the upper and lower bounds to the solution space. In case of multi variable design space, the least PF variable would provide the lower bounds and the highest PF variable the upper bounds. For the illustrative performance directive fp, and dual variable design space:

min Pmin  N R 1 .K R1 K R1
max Pmax  N R 2 .K R 2

(23) (24)

Pmin is the smallest step function possible in the direction of cost function objective and Pmax is the maximum growth possible in the cost function along resource R2.

b) Compounded Function: The compounded average takes the combined effect of resources into consideration averaged over the total number of resources in the solution set and can be described mathematically as:
N R1.K R1 N R 2 .K R 2 no. _ of _ resorces

Pavg 

(25)

29

Pmin and Pmax provide the lower and upper bounds of the solution space. The objective is to keep the compounded average Pavg in between the limiting bounds. By doing so, the solution front is restricted from exploring the overlapping regions of the solution space and keeps the solution front along paretooptimal design points having one to one output-input relationship. Fig. 9 to 14 show the graphical representation of absolute and compounded average of R1 and R2 being driven by sample performance space directive. The graphical representation shows the compounded average of cost function P averaged over the design variable variants of R1 and R2. For example (1, R1) shows the compounded average of R2 and R1, with R2 held at unity and R1 allowed to vary over a discreet range of restricted integer values. Also shown in Fig. 9 to 14 are the lower and upper bounds of P as an independent function of R1 and R2. The objective is to gradually expand the cost function while maintaining good resolution and low time complexity. The framework attempts to restrict the solution front in most optimal range of R1 and R2 in between the upper and lower bounds. Fig. 10 shows the discreet points marked by the letters a to g, signifying the point of inflection, where the cost functions compounded average touches the lower bounds of resource R1. For any given curve, the framework restricts the range of exploration to these critical points, as the further exploration along R1 would make the solution R1 dominated, thus rendering diminishing returns on per unit additional resource utilization. Fig.11 shows the strictly increasing cost function graphs which are most suitable tradeoff between R2 and R1. Fig. 12 and 13 show possible ways to traverse the design space with increasing cost function derivatives along R2 and R1. As shown in Fig. 13, an ideal path would be along the geometrical centers of the increasing sets of cost functions. This is not feasible due to the imprecise resolution of R2 to represent the values at the mid points of the instantaneous cost functions. Fig. 14 shows a feasible and most suitable stepping function with the following important properties: (i) a continuous and seamless transition along the local domains of R1 and R2 (ii) an ideal balance between the precision of low per unit contributing resource R1 and the higher
30

efficiency but lower precise R2. Therefore the balancing point between two competing variables is given by:
min K R1.N R1  K R 2 .N R 2

(26)

Or in general,
min K Ri .N Ri  K( Ri 1) .N R ( i 1)

(27)

where KR(i+1) is the next immediate variable to active solution set in the ordered PF hierarchy. Equation (27) is the general equation for restricting the extent of exploration of a local variable before proceeding to the next variable in the partially ordered design space. By maintaining this condition the solution front can be restricted from exploring the dominated regions of the design space having diminishing returns. Fig. 8 summarizes the DSE algorithm.

Chapter 4 Case Study
4.1 Design Flow Initiation
This chapter provides a comprehensive case study of IIR filter synthesis application to elaborate upon the proposed DSE HLS framework. Here the IIR filter is defined as the behavioral/ high level function corresponding to its characteristic function. The high level IIR filter function will be subjected to the proposed DSE framework which helps identify the structure/ configuration of the module for the given set of desired performance characteristics and budgeting constraints. This phase of the design stage is critical because the operational constraints must be clearly defined along with the parameters to be optimized. These specifications will act as the input information for the high level synthesis tools.

4.2 Problem Description
4.2.1 Input­Application Specification: The IIR filter application can be defined by equation (28) as follows:
H ( z)  Y ( z) 0.041(1  z 1 ) 2  X ( z ) 1  1.4418 z 1  0.6743z 2

(28)

36

Or

y(n)  0.041x(n)  0.082 x(n  1)  0.041x(n  2)  1.4418 y(n  1)  0.6743 y(n  2) (29)

where, x(n), x(n-1) and x(n-2) are the input vector variables for the function. The prior outputs are given by y (n-1) and y(n-2), while the present output of the function is given by y(n). For ease of representation, the following constants 0.041, 0.082, 0.6743 and 1.4418 are represented as A, B, C and D respectively. x(n), x(n-1), x(n-2), y (n-1) and y (n-2) are denoted by Xn, Xn1, Xn2, Yn1 and Yn2 respectively.

4.3 Performance Requirements and System Constraints:
The performance requirements and budgeting constraints dictate the system micro-architecture and organization, as well as the design and development costs. From the practicality point of view, the following critical performance space measures are included in the presented case study design flow: power consumption, execution speed while minimizing area, and system development cost. Performance requirements and budgeting constraints assumed for the case study are as follows: 1) Maximum power budget: Max 11 watt 2) Maximum resource availability: (a) Three clock frequencies (50, 100, 200 MHz) (b) Multiplier variants: Maximum of four (c) Adder variants: Maximum of two 3) Maximum execution time: 62 msec. 4) Optimization goal: Minimize power utilization while satisfying the above constraints

37

4.4 Components­Library Specification:
The component library consists of the primitive processing elements (PE) providing the basic building blocks of the system. Each PE is characterized by its area, latency and power consumption, with power being a complex function of area and operational frequency. The case study undertakes the following design specifications for the primitive library components [12]: 1) No. of clock cycles needed for multiplier to finish each operation: 4 cc. 2) No of clock cycles needed by the adder/ subtractor: 2 cc. 3) Area occupied by each adder/ subtractor: 20 a.u. on the chip (e.g. 20 CLB on an FPGA). 4) Area occupied by each multiplier: 80 a.u. on the chip. (e.g. 80 CLB on an FPGA). 5) Area occupied by the 50, 100, 200 MHz clock oscillator: 4, 6, 10 area units respectively. 6) Power consumed at 50 MHz: 10 mW / area unit. 7) Power consumed at 100 MHz: 20 mW / area unit. 8) Power consumed at 200 MHz: 60 mW / area unit.

4.5 Solution Overview:
Behavioral synthesis of a system module consists of at least three basic stages: mapping, scheduling and binding.

a) Mapping: Mapping involves the selection of basic building block elements and their respective variant(s) from the component library to map the high level task function on system micro architecture. The function or task mapping must adhere to overall system objectives in compliance with performance requirements as well as budgeting constraints.
38

b) Scheduling: The scheduling policy determines the order and method by which the system resources and processing elements are accessed by the application tasks. The need for scheduling policy arises from the requirement of multiple tasks trying to access a limited number of resources in the constrained system. Scheduling policy works in very close co-ordination with task mapping to maximize the system performance for the given objectives.

c) Binding: Resource binding determines the sharing of constrained resource(s) for different operations in the tightly coupled data path pipeline. The resources can be bound in spatial and temporal domains depending upon the application data structure and data dependencies. Multiplexing and de-multiplexing schemes along with temporary memory elements facilitate resource sharing.

As discussed above, task mapping acts as liaison between objective function and performance space requirements; it is one of the most important phases to effectively capture the design requirements, application data structure, data dependencies and resource utilization in the modular system design. This case study will concentrate on the task mapping and resource allocation, while remaining confined to standard ASAP scheduling algorithms.

39

4.6 Design Space Organization:
The next section determines the relative importance of the design variables (Namely adder/ multiplier/ clock) for the objective performance parameters (viz. area/ power / execution time). The order of these variables will help determine the border variants for solution feasibility studies.

4.7 Analysis for Power Consumption: With Power as the performance parameter, the relative importance of each of the decision variable resources in the design space is ascertained. PF is calculated for each of the design resources to calculate its relative importance/ contribution towards the power objective: 1) PF of adder / subtractor:

PF ( R1) 

N R1.K R1 max (2  1).20 . pc  .60  600 N R1 2 (30)

2) PF of multiplier:
PF ( R2)  N R 2 .K R 2 max (4  1).80 . pc  .60  3600 N R2 4 (31)

3) PF of clock oscillator:
PF ( R3)  N R1.TR1  N R 2 .TR 2 .(pc ) N Rclk

(32)



(2.20  4.100) .(60  10)  7333.33 3

40

The above factors indicate the true resource contribution capacities to the objective cost function with the change in number of a specific resource. For example, clock resource is the most detrimental factor for increased power consumption over its range from 50 to 200 MHz. The adder/ subtractor make the least effective contribution to the power requirements. As clock is the most effective yet least precise contributor to power consumption objective, it is at the top of the hierarchy followed by lesser per unit contributors, multiplier and adder units, in the objective cost function. Thus, PF (Clock) > PF (Multiplier) > PF (Adder/ Subtractor) The order of contribution decides the direction of exploration for DSE explorer to effectively map the performance objective on the Design space variables.

4.8 Analysis for execution speed parameter:
Similar to Power consumption PF analysis, the relative importance of design variables towards frame execution speed is investigated:

1) PF of adder/ subtractor:
PF ( R1)  N R1.TR1 max (2  1).2 .Tp  .(0.02)  0.02 N R1 2 (33)

2) PF of multiplier:
PF ( R2)  N R 2 .TR 2 max (4  1).4 .Tp  .(0.02)  0.06 N R2 4 (34)

3) PF of clock resource:
PF ( R3)  N R1.TR1  N R 2 .TR 2 .(Tp ) N Rclk
41



(2.2  4.4) .(0.02  0.005)  0.1 3

Thus the relative order of exploration for frame execution speed parameter will be as follows: PF (Clock) > PF (Multiplier) > PF (Adder/ Subtractor) The above measures indicate the relative resource contribution from different system resources to affect the frame execution speed. Thus, clock can be the most detrimental factor to speed up the frame execution time followed by multiplier and adder/ Subtractor unit.

4.9 Design Space Traversal with Power as Performance Directive:
Once the relative importance of design space variables is ascertained for different performance space parameters, the design space must be explored to identify the optimal design variant configuration that meets all the design objectives and constraints. Power is chosen as the primary performance objective for its ever increasing importance in HLS domain, which is gradually mapped on the design space variables. The DSE explorer optimally reflects the expanding power budget on design space variables by guiding the solution front through the pareto-optimal points. This results in a range of local optimal solutions limited to the globally optimal solution at the border variant [33,37] as described in the next section.

4.10 Selection of Optimal Variant:
With power as the primary performance directive the DSE explorer gradually expands the power budget on design space variables. The resource sets are explored in the order of PF hierarchy starting with adder (R1), the least PF variable, gradually moving up the hierarchy to multiplier (R2) and clocking (R3) variants:

PF (clock) > PF (multiplier) > PF (adder/ subtractor)

Table 1 lists the design space configuration variants for the presented IIR filter synthesis case study with each variant characterized in terms of power consumption, latency, area and frame execution time parameters. In order to overcome DSE time complexity, the ordered design space is subjected to multidimensional feasibility study coupled with binary search engine [21,6]. 1. The design exploration augments the most frugal power consumption variant with minimal resources (one adder, one multiplier) operating at minimum frequency at 50 MHz. Thus,

 (1 20  1 80).10 = 1 watt

(36)

min where, Pc is the minimum per unit power consumption rate, namely 10 mW / unit area at 50 MHz.

2. The DSE explorer expands the solution front in the local domain of active variable resource R1 to balance the next variable in PF hierarchy:
min P(Variant_ 2)  ( N R1.2 .K R1 N R 2 .K R 2 ).R3.1

 (2  20  1 80).10 = 1.2 watt

(37)

where, Ri.j represents the jth variant of ith resource. For example, R1.2 represents the 2nd variant of type 1 resource.

(38)

44

In order to expand the solution wave front, the DSE explorer perturbs the next variable in PF hierarchy. Thus, R2 is included in the basic solution set.

4.

The DSE explorer expands the cost function (Power) while searching for the border variants [6,21]. At variant 4, the DSE explorer reaches the point of inflection, where resource R1s two variants (R1.2) and resource R2s two (R2.2) variants combines to balance the equivalent cost contribution of resource R3s two variants (R3.2):

(R1.2 10  R2.2 10) | R3.1  (R1.1  20  R 2.1  20) | R3.2
Or,

(2  20  2  80) 10  (1 20  1 80)  20  2 watt (39)
Variant 4 with 2 adders, 2 multipliers, operating at 50 MHz

Variant 9 with 1 adder, 1 multiplier, operating at 100 MHz

At this point the DSE explorer restricts further exploration in the local domains of (R1, R2). Resource area overhead is traded for higher system clock frequency at 100 MHz with reduced parallelization, while limited to the same power consumption rating of 2 watts. Note, exploration between variants 4 and 9 would have provided diminishing returns on power speed ratio making the solution space R1, R2 dominant. By pruning the dominated design space, the DSE explorer has kept the solution space to be R3 dominated with the higher PF. The frame execution time parameter for these variables is ascertained to demonstrate their superior characteristics to the non-dominated design variants. The frame execution speed is calculated as follows:
45

Texec  [latency  (n  1) cycle ]   c.c.

(40)

where Texec is the frame execution time, n is the number of frames, cycle is the pipeline throughput measured in clock cycles and c.c. is system clock rate. Thus for 1000 frame execution, variants 4 and 9 have the following frame execution time:

4 Texec  [16  999  12]  (0.02) = 240.08 msec (41)

9 Texec  [22  999  20]  (0.01)

= 200.02 msec (42)

n where, Texec is the nth variant execution time. Although both design variants (4 and 9) compete for the

same power ratings, variant 9 provides better execution speed per unit power consumption. The variants in the pruned dominated region (#V4 to #V9) have an inferior power to speed ratio relative to their nondominated counterparts. A closer look reveals that the DSE explorer has effectively traded of excessive hardware resources to clock at higher speed while limited to the same power budget (2W). In fact, all non dominated solutions can be verified as the locally optimal solution for their instantaneous power budgets. The pruned regions (V5, V6, V7, V8) and (V15, V16) are the overlapped regions between the design variable domains having inferior one to many correspondence in other dimensions of the performance space. 5. The DSE explorer expands the solution front, traversing seamlessly through the local domains of the arranged variables trading area with increasing clock rate to the point of border variant, with global

46

constrained power budget of 11 Watt. Variant 19 represents the border variant consuming 10.8 watts of power as shown below:

P(Variant_19)  ( N R1.1.K R1 N R 2.2 .K R 2 ).R3.3
 (1 20  2  80)  60  10.8 watt
(43)

Thus, two multipliers and an adder/ subtractor unit clocking at 100 MHz provide the best execution speed performance with minimal area. Table 1 summarizes the progression of the solution front through the ordered design variable space. Traversing the design space and pruning variants as per the condition of stability (eq. 27), the DSE explorer identifies not only the global optimal solution at the border variant but also all the locally optimal solutions, up to the limiting conditions of system optimization. To accelerate the search process, the DSE framework incorporates multi dimensional binary search instead of linear search along with the design pruning conditions. Interested readers can refer to [21,6] for a detailed explanation on multi-dimensional binary search.

4.11 Module Synthesis: Quick Overview
This section presents an overview of IIR filter synthesis at RTL level. The authors previous publications can be referred to for a more detailed explanation on the topic [33]. This section looks at the most important stages of modular design synthesis including development of data path, control path, Sequencing and binding of resources, determination of control unit and multiplexing scheme for the IIR filter case study.

4.12 Scheduling: Sequencing and Resource Binding
Sequencing graphs (SG) [12] are an effective way to represent the spatial and temporal domain of the sequence of operations applied on application data set. Scheduling algorithms sequence the system resources in time and space to effectively map the behavioral function on the module data set. This work uses ASAP as the standard scheduling algorithm for the presented case study. Fig. 15 shows the ASAP scheduling graph of IIR optimal architectural variant. The figure also shows the binding of system resources, namely the adder and multiplier units in different time slots along with peripheral registers P holding interleaved data.

4.13 Determination of Multiplexing Scheme:
Binding of resources in the presented design flow warrants a multiplexing and de-multiplexing scheme to maintain the continuous and desired data flow through the data processing engine [12]. A multiplexing scheme works closely with a control unit, which is detailed separately in the preceding sub-sections. The main task of the multiplexing scheme is to configure the processing elements in the data path before subjecting them to the data to be processed. Tables 2, 3 and 4 summarize the necessary multiplexing scheme for the multiplier, adder/ subtractor respectively clocking at the desired frequency.

4.14 Module Block Representation:
Once the module micro-architectural configuration is determined along with the associated multiplexing/ de-multiplexing scheme the design can be converted into its equivalent Register Transfer Level (RTL) representation. Fig.16 shows the IIR filter module with optimal design variant resources embedded in the data path along with the associated control path signals. In addition to processing elements and multiplexing scheme the block representation also includes necessary memory elements, latches and the temporary register elements. The processing elements embedded in the data path impart its characteristic function to the implied data flowing through well defined interfaces in compliance with application data structure. The module works in complete synchronization under the control unit.

4.15 Control Path Description:
The control unit provides the necessary timing and synchronization signals to different processing elements. For the synchronous flawless operation of the system, the control unit must produce the desired

5.2 Benchmark Results:
The proposed DSE design flow was applied to a number of well known High Level Synthesis benchmark applications to ascertain the exploration speedup. These benchmarks were adopted from [30] for HLS studies. The proposed algorithm demonstrated an impressive 71.8 % average speed up over a range of the tested benchmark applications. Table 6 summarizes the observed speed up attained for the optimal architecture variant selection. The observed DSE speedup was more pronounced for larger benchmark applications (i.e. FIR was observed at 85.83% acceleration) indicating the practical scalability of the proposed approach to large scale applications. Table 6 summarizes the number of variants in the design space, the total number of variants for along all the parameter directions, the actual number of variants analyzed by the proposed DSE approach and the comparative speedup achieved in DSE exploration. Fig. 19 elaborates upon the DSE speedup progression through various benchmark applications viz. IIR digital filter, ARF Filter, DWT transformation, Elliptic Wave filter and MPEG motion vector.

This increasing power performance parameter was attained by keeping the solution exploration front along the non-dominated variants of the solution space. In comparison, Fig. 20.a shows a partially arranged design space for the same application. As evident, the partially arranged design space has one-to-many correspondence(s) in the gaps where the design space variable domain overlaps. In contrast, the fully arranged design space with restricted domains, as shown in fig. 20.b, has an absolute one-to-one correspondence for any given performance specification mapped onto the design space variables.

5.3 Complexity Analysis
The presented work converts the partially arranged design space to absolutely arranged design space. When the design space variables are arranged/ explored in PF hierarchal order, the cost function increases linearly but in sections depending upon the overlapping of domains. This results in the partially arranged design space. The presented framework applies the binary search just across each of the partially arranged sections and look for the point of balance where an active/base variable combines to balance the next variable in hierarchy. The complexity of the binary search is observed to be of the order of log2n, where ,,n' is the number of member variants in the search space. Therefore the search computational complexity of the instantaneous point
log 2  v Ri
i 1 n

of balance would require

(where ,,n = number of type of resources and ,,vRi is the number of

variants of resource ,,Ri) for each arranged section of the partially arranged design space. If there are ,, n' variables in the design space that would correspond to n arranged sections in partially arranged design space. Each of the arranged section of the design space is subjected to binary search therefore, the complexity across a given performance cost objective would be of the order of n * log 2  vRi , where n is the number of design
i 1 n

variables in DSE space. The proposed DSE framework searches along the multiple objectives of the performance space. For example in the case study power consumption, area and execution speed constitutes three dimensions of the performance space. Therefore the search has to be performed thrice along each of the scaled dimension. Similarly for ,,M' performance parameters, the computational complexity of the proposed framework will be of the order of:
M * n * log 2  vRi .
i 1 n

58

Although the complexity is quadratic but is still a lot faster (of the order of 72%) than in comparison to an exhaustive search, which would require M *  v Ri while achieving the accuracy just as good as in an
i 1 n

exhaustive approach. The next section would compare and contrast the presented work to an existing approach which achieves faster exploration by the factor of n (number of design variables), but readily comprises on achievable accuracy resolution.

5.4 Comparative Studies
This sub-section compares the presented framework computational complexity with an existing DSE approach [21]. The authors in [21] have subjected the partially arranged design space to multi-dimensional binary search min-max analysis to arrive at a suitable design variants. Table 7 shows the relative speedup achieved by the proposed framework in comparison to the [21] DSE framework. Although, as apparent the presented framework is ,,n times computationally slower than the compared existing work but it has higher accuracy resolution to the factor of least significant PF variable to come closest to the desired cost objective (budget). The presented framework only traverses the most suitable/desirable range of the partially arranged design space and changes the base variable to the next variable in PF hierarchy to keep the cost function absolutely increasing. In contrast, although the compared framework [21] achieves a significant speedup in comparison by a factor of ,,n, but can easily get stuck in the local optima of the partially arranged design space and compromise upon the achievable solution accuracy. The absolute figures of the solution accuracy comparison are subjective and will wary from one example to other.

5.5 Scope of Framework Application and Known Limitations
5.5.1 Data Path vs. Control Unit The presented work optimizes the data path as per the given constraints, performance specifications and behavioral description of the application. The optimization framework is concentrated upon utilizing the given data processing elements in the most efficient manner. But as a consequence or side-effect of optimizing a given resource in the data path, the associated multiplexing and control circuitry/signals gets complex. Although not as dramatic as to completely offset the benefits extracted from the data path optimization, the control unit complexity does effect the overall improvement in terms of cost/area savings, power utilization etc.

60

As a rule of thumb a definite cost weight can be subjected to achievable improvements to make corrections for the actual/ achievable performance figures.

5.5.2 Relationship in between design space variables In order for the design space exploration to readily applicable to multiple dimensions of the multiobjective optimization problem, the design variables are expected to have a definite relationship which can be directly in-order or exactly reverse order. The parsed space by the ,,Stability in Competition principle would than correspond and hold to each of the performance space of the multi-objective optimization problem.

61

Chapter 6 Conclusion and Future Work 6.1 Conclusion
This thesis has presented a novel framework to ascertain the optimal design architectural configuration from a large design space. This framework is based upon the order and extent of design variable exploration. The order in design space exploration variable helps determine the border variant of the feasible solution space, whereas the extent of variable exploration helps keep the solution front from exploring the redundant regions of the design space containing diminishing returns. The well known economics Stability in Competition [16] principle is applied in this novel approach to restrict the extent of ordered resource exploitation. As a result, this work is successfully able to attain absolute and fully arranged design space along the performance parameter axis. The improved and fully arranged design space is subjected to multi-dimensional binary search for the optimal design variant selection. This framework presents an improvement over existing approaches, which are prone to be caught in local optimum. A robust set of mathematical formulations along with the graphical
62

representation of the framework is presented, which can be applied to real world synthesis applications with minimal human intervention. An average 71.8% speedup in design space exploration was achieved while maintaining prime accuracy resolution and better speedups for larger design space benchmark applications. The improvement in speedup for larger design space problems shows the scalability of the framework to large scale applications. A thorough case study of IIR filter synthesis application has been presented in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 elaborates upon the results. This high level synthesis design space exploration approach is applicable to a very large number of commercial applications at the system architecture level. Based upon the required performance specifications and various budgeting constraints this framework can effectively translate high level design requirements into low level system architecture configurations for a given set of library components. This approach can also be integrated in Electronic Design automation (EDA) tool chain sets to determine the optimal modular configuration for the contradictory performance requirements/ constraints. The quest of modern embedded systems for high portability and enormous processing power lends itself to the contradictory parameters of speed and power consumption numbers. This approach can help determine the optimal architecture configuration without the overkill of any of the available design resources. It can thus serve as the stepping stone between the behavioral and structural stage of the high level synthesis design flow.

63

6.2 Future Work:
This approach can be applied in real time to reconfigure the system architecture data path as per the instantaneous design specifications and design rules. The reconfigurable hardware can have redundant parallelization along the data path and the custom requirements can be mapped in real time to reflect the instantaneous design goals, budgeting constraints and loads. Rigorous mathematical formulations and algorithm(s) have been presented to ascertain the optimal design configuration for a given set of high level requirements. Secondly, the presented work concentrates on the synthesis application data path optimization. This concept can also be expanded for control path optimization. Control path optimization poses specialized and even more complex problems as the control unit and multiplexing scheme becomes affected by data path optimization. A thorough analysis can be performed and the framework can be worked out taking into account the data path and control path tradeoff analysis for a given HLS application as well as work load and budgeting constraints.
