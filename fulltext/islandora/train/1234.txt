Abstract
This thesis presents experimental studies of vibration of a straight beam and a thin plate in axial pipe flow. Dynamic behaviors of the two structures are investigated for a wide range of mean flow velocities. Responses of the structures were measured and analyzed in the time and frequency domains with an aim to understand the fluid-solid interactions. The experimental results reveal that high mean flow velocities can excite higher vibration modes because of turbulence.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION
Research on axial flow induced vibrations received significant attention from the nuclear industry when dealing with vibrations of heat exchanger tubes and fuel bundles [1]. Experiments were carried out on a cylinder in axial flow in a test loop [2]. The axial flow induced vibrations in industrial structures are usually of small amplitude. These small amplitude vibrations or fretting in nuclear reactor fuel-element bundles can cause wear or damage to the supporting tubes over a long period of time [3]. Replacement of these supporting tubes is costly from time and economic stand points.

Real industrial structures, such as a nuclear fuel bundle, are too complicated in geometry. In this thesis, a straight beam and a thin plate in an axial pipe flow are studied. Results from these simple structures help understand the excitation mechanisms.

Well known mechanisms include vortex shedding (caused by oscillating flow separation from a circular cylindrical structure in cross-flow), galloping (caused by fluid forces due to the motion of a noncircular structure in cross-flow), turbulence buffeting, fluid-elastic instability, and pulsational flow [4, 5]. Turbulence buffeting, fluid-elastic instability and pulsational flow are the three dominating mechanisms in axial flow. Turbulence induced excitation or turbulence buffeting is an extraneously induced excitation due to surface pressure fluctuations associated with turbulence in the flow. The magnitude of these surface pressure fluctuations increases with the increase in the mean flow velocity [6]. Fluid-elastic instability is a flow induced excitation resulting from any or all of the fluid inertia, fluid damping and fluid stiffness forces that arise
1

from high fluid flow velocities causing large amplitude oscillations. Finally, pulsational flow is another extraneously induced excitation due to the use of limited number of impellers and vanes in pumps [5].

1.1. Objectives and Methodology
The objective of this thesis is to study the flexural vibration behaviors of two simple structures (a beam and a plate) in an axial pipe flow with varying mean flow velocities.

1.2. Literature Review
1.2.1. Cylinder in axial flow

The dynamics of a beam of circular cross section (also called cylinder) in axial flow was studied by PaYdoussis [1] both analytically and experimentally. His works lead to the derivation of the equations of motion including the effect of axial flow. According to PaYdoussis [7], cylinders experience fluid-elastic instabilities when the mean flow velocity reaches certain critical values.

Vibration of cylindrical structures in axial flow was directly related to the power industry. The following topics are significant to the concerned industries [3]: (i) Measurement of the amplitude of particular cylindrical structure configurations, modeling nuclear reactor components and flow conditions. (ii) Understanding the causes of vibrations such as turbulence buffeting, fluid-elastic instability, pulsational flow etc. (iii) Development of means for predicting the vibration amplitudes which is an important ingredient for design.

From experiments [3, 8, 9], it was found that, for a solid steel cylinder with Lldc = 100 in water flow, the dimensional critical flow velocity Ucd- 1180 ft/s - 360 m/s in order to observe any fluid-elastic instabilities. Such high mean flow velocities are not possible in practical applications. Even for very slender hollow cylinder, excited by the flow in both its beam and shell modes, with Lldc
=

100 and a thickness-to-diameter ratio of 1/50, the critical velocity Ucd-

29 m/s, which is very large in practice.

For this reason, experiments on fluid-elastic instabilities have been carried out for cylinders of elastomers (with very low modulus of elasticity Ec) in order to experimentally observe the said phenomenon in axial flow.

1.2.2.

Plates in axial flow

Study on the dynamics of plates finds an important place in the aeronautical industry. The reason can be attributed to the application of this study to high-performance aircraft and missile skins. Similarly, hydroelasticity of plates includes dynamics of plates in relation to application to submarine skins, boundary-layer transition to turbulence and noise generation. Paper making and winding, high-speed tape winding and spinning disks in disk-drives are a few more applications that make the study of plate vibration in axial flow important.

Applications of this kind of fluid-structure interaction system could be traced to renewable sources of energy generation by extracting energy from the surrounding fluid flow for generation of electric power. One such concept of new energy-harvesting devices is called the flutter-mill. All this was based on the dynamics of cantilever flexible plates subjected to axial flow. In the theoretical work done by Paldoussis et al. [10, 11], he found that cantilever flexible plates subjected to axial flow lose stability by flutter at a sufficiently high flow velocity.

3

An application proposed by Allen and Smits [12] is to use piezoelectric foils in an ocean current, oscillating in response to vortices shed from a bluff body located upstream and convected along their lengths thereby generating electricity.

1.3. Contributions and usefulness of the proposed research
In the experiment with cylinder in axial flow an underwater bi-axial accelerometer was used to pickup the fluid-structure interactions. In the experiments available in the literature, visual aids were used for a similar study. This thesis presents some much needed quantitative experimental studies. A plate was placed inside a water-flowing pipe. The lateral vibration response was picked up using a tri-axial accelerometer. In the literature, the experiments were carried out with fluid flow on one side of the structure in the case of a hydro-elastic study. In the experiments, smart sensors (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems accelerometers also known as MEMS accelerometers) were used. The bi-axial and tri-axial MEMS accelerometers are available at a very low cost and at the same time designed with built-in low-pass filters measuring frequencies from 0.5 Hz to 550Hz. These MEMS accelerometers are ideally suited for the above experiments, as the research in flow induced vibrations focuses on low frequency. Calibrations and the manufacturer's data sheets show that these sensors exhibit on-par sensitivity with respect to their piezoelectric counterparts. Another advantage over piezoelectric sensors is that these MEMS accelerometers, for a given sensor size, pickup responses in 2-axes in the case of bi-axial ones and 3-axes in the case of tri-axial ones. The tiny size of these sensors including the circuit board can be designed within a diameter of 8 mm and can be embedded axially in a cylinder of 12 mm diameter. This would not be possible in the case of commercially available piezoelectric accelerometers due to their larger sizes.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE
2.1. Test Rig without Tank
In the nuclear power industry, the piping network is designed as a closed loop system and high

velocities of flow are achieved using a centrifugal pump. Pump pulsations in such systems are quite predominant. Consequently, the signals from turbulence induced vibration of structures are often embedded in the noise pump pulsation signals. In order to capture signals from the fluid structure interaction due to turbulent flow, the test rig was modified by adding a tank for absorbing energy from flow pulsations. The water circulating test rig contains two sets of pipes. 11\e first set of pipes of 8 inch (204 mm) diameter is placed at the ends of the closed loop (photographed in Figure 2.1-1 ). The second set of transparent pipes of 4 inch in diameter is placed in the central portion as a test chamber and is 64 inch (-1625 mm) in length. A digital flow meter is installed near the discharge end for monitoring the mean flow rate. A 7-vane centrifugal pump, with radial inlet and radial outlet, powered by a 3-phase 60Hz motor (10 HP, 1760 RPM rated speed), is used to achieve desired flow rates. The spindle speed of this motor is controlled by a Danfoss VLT6000 system in 1-60 steps, thus enabling a fine increment
in flow velocities. In this test rig, the position of the test structure is 40 inch or 10 times the pipe
1

diameter from the 90 degree bend to ensure that the incoming flow is a fully developed pipe flow. The rig along with the test section was filled up with water at room temperature and a static pressure of 40 psi (-280 kPa). Measures were taken to eliminate air bubbles in the system

2.2. Test Rig with Tank
In the process of upgrading the previous setup of test rig, a reservoir was added. The test rig was revamped and structurally reinforced with 11 rigid supports replacing floating ones. The tank of 48 inch in diameter and 73 inch in height has capacity of 500 US gallons. Figure 2.2-1 shows the entire experimental setup with the tank, which was introduced mainly to reduce the flow pulsations. In this rig, the test section is placed at -3.8 m downstream from the 90 degree bend maintaining smooth flow. The rig along with the test section was filled up with water at room temperature
with approximately 1.8 m positive head that eliminates all air bubbles initially trapped into the

system during filling.

2.3. Preparation of cylinder
For this experiment the clamped-free cylinder (or cantilever cylinder) with blunt end was made from a commercially available 12.7 mm diameter silicon rubber chord stock manufactured by Global Rubber Products, Ontario having a specification S70 - a 70 durometer silicon rubber was used. Appendix A provides detailed steps in the preparation of this cylinder. Technical report with physical and mechanical properties for the above material from manufacturer and results from tensile test performed for the chord stock in Mechanical Engineering Department materials lab enclosed in Appendix D. The Figure 2.3-1 shows the isometric view of the cantilever cylinder and aluminum holder permanent assembly.

Selection of Accelerometer: In most engineering applications high-amplitude low-frequency vibrations of 4 Hz to 300 Hz cause damage or failure of equipment [ 13 & 14]. This was one of the driving factors in the selection of underwater accelerometer in addition to sensitivity, resolution and size. Given that the diameter of the elastomer cylinder is 12.7 mm diameter by design, the accelerometer circuit board was limited to 8 mm diameter so that its installation causes minimal distortion in the free end of the cylinder. Extensive research for an underwater accelerometer (piezo-electric or MEMS) in the market showed they are expensive. Thus and the search was limited to above-water MEMS type transducer as it was more economical and easy to install along with its tiny circuit. The ADXL321 from Analog Devices is a MEMS type thin and small with 4 mm square by 1.45 mm
9

thick, 16-lead and plastic lead frame chip scale packaging features capable of measuring acceleration with a full-scale range of ±18 g. The ADXL321 is a small and thin, low power, complete dual-axis accelerometer with signal conditioned voltage outputs, single monolithic integrated circuit. It can also measure both dynamic acceleration (vibration) and static acceleration (gravity). The bandwidth of the accelerometer established as 0- 500Hz using capacitors 0.01 flF for both X andY axes at the XOUT and YOUT pins per data sheet, enclosed in Appendix B, to suit application. Typical vibration spectra of cantilevered flexible cylinders in highly confined axial flow sensed with embedded accelerometer [9], recorded that the acceleration experienced was over Sg (rms) and hence transducer with a full scale range of± 18 g for measuring acceleration was considered to be sufficient for this experiment. A two layered printed circuit board was designed with help from Satellite Design and Management Lab (Ryerson University) using free printed circuit board (PCB) layout software from Express PCB (www.expresspcb.com) in order to manufacture in-house tiny accelerometer circuit limiting size to 8 mm diameter and 4 mm thick. This custom design was required to suit to the size of the cylinder with flexible connections. The ones available in the market, of a slightly bigger size with under water capability, were quite expensive. A local vendor in Markham, Ontario, provided its services in installing the components on these boards thus making reliable accelerometers. Four long flexible multi strand wires of predetermined length were taken out of commercially available 60 conductor ribbon cable (multi wire planar cable) and soldered to the accelerometer to complete the circuit. 10

As per manufacturer guidelines and recommendations the ADXL321 type accelerometer though tested and specified at supply voltage, Vs = 3 V. However, it can be powered with Vs as low as 2.4 V or as high as 6 V. The zero g bias output being ratiometric, hence the zero g output nominally equal to Vs/2 at all supply voltages. A DC supply of 4.5 V generated from three 1.5 V of AA size batteries is provided to the accelerometer for two main reasons: · The output being ratiometric, so the sensitivity (or scale factor) varies proportionally to supply voltage: at Vs = 5 V, typically sensitivity is 100 mV/g; at Vs = 2.4 V, typically sensitivity is 45 mV/g as per manufacturer. · The output noise was not ratiometric but was absolute in volts. As a result the noise density decreases as the supply voltage increases. The reason being the scale factor (mV/g) increases while the noise voltage remains constant. At Vs = 5 V, the noise density typically 190 J.Lgi"Hz, while at V s given in manufacturer' s literature. Accelerometer calibration was carried out by using Dytran made calibration shaker as shown in Appendix E. The sensitivity of accelerometer was taken as 84 mVolt/g or 0.084 Volt/g or equivalent to 116.785 m/s 2 N olt from the calibrations charts.

= 2.4 V, the noise density typically 400 J.Lgi"Hz as

Cantilever setup with transducer: The accelerometer was carefully oriented with its 4 mm square face parallel to the cross section and installed in the axial hole at the free end of the cantilever cylinder. Further to this the square side of the accelerometer was aligned parallel I perpendicular to the stainless strips in the cantilever cylinder manually within ±1.0° accuracy.

11

Silicon rubber adhesive (Sil-Poxy from Smooth-On Inc., Easton, PA) was evenly applied over the inserted transducer to fill up the axial hole on the free end of cantilever cylinder making it a blunt flat end with minimum surface imperfections.

The wires of the accelerometer were carefully oriented and laid on either side of the stainless steel strip along the axis of the cylinder and retained in place with silicon rubber adhesive. This was done in such a way that the four-single 28 gauge multi-strand wires have negligible effect on the flexural rigidity (Ec *I) of the cantilever cylinder. These wires were routed axially on the aluminum fixture and adapter using the above silicon rubber adhesive as shown below in Figure 2.3-2.

Test-fixture for cantilever cylinder: In order to place the cantilever along the axis of the test

section of pipe in the water circulating test rig a simple Test-Fixture was designed with a 4 inch (101.6 mm) outside diameter (OD) and 3Y2 inch (88.9 mm) inside diameter polycarbonate tube. The OD of the tube was machined down to 100 mm diameter for a length of 86 mm leaving a shoulder so that it can slide into the test section of the pipe without interference. Four equally spaced radial holes drilled through all the wall thickness of the tube and tapped with M4x0. 7 threads at a predetermined position(s).

The cantilever was then secured along the axis of the tube with the help of M4 x 0. 7 stainless steel studs and three pairs of M4 x 0. 7 hexagonal nuts to achieve zero DOF at the adapter end of the cantilever. The cantilever cylinder was located axially along the test-fixture by tensioning the three stainless steel studs between the aluminum adapter and polycarbonate tube. Figure 2.3-3 shows the arrangement.

Experimental Setup:

This test-fixture- cantilever cylinder assembly then inserted carefully into the test section of the water pipe in the water-circulating test rig ensuring the orientation of the stainless strips in the cantilever along the vertical plane ensuring the orientation of the accelerometer along the horizontal or vertical axis with± 1.0° accuracy.

The test-fixture - cantilever cylinder assembly was then secured rigidly with zero DOF by compression force provided by the mating flange to the pipe of the test section in the rig and the electrical leads are cautiously routed along the face of the flange and connected to the circuit using the terminal strip.

The circuit consists of the following components:

I. Test fixture- cantilever cylinder assembly in the water circulating test rig 2. Data acquisition system comprising a laptop (oscilloscope software loaded) and USB Oscilloscope - Handyscope HS4 with 4 channels, sampling 195.3125 kHz at 16 bit resolution (from TiePie engineering, Netherlands)
3. 4.5V DC battery pack with four port terminal strip 4. Two coaxial cables with BNC connectors on one end and the other end open An additional accelerometer was installed on the mid-section of the test pipe along the radial and

tangential planes to pick up the structure vibrations induced by the flow. Figure 2.3-4, Figure 2.3-5 and Figure 2.3-6 illustrate the setup.

Experimental procedure:

1. Flow meter readings recorded at each increment of pump controller from 1 Hz to 57 Hz 2. The flow meter was then turned off to avoid picking up noise i.e., 60 Hz and its multiple harmonics by the accelerometer(s) 3. The fluorescent lights were turned off to avoid picking up of noise 120 Hz and its multiples 4. Laptop was operated on battery for the entire duration of the experiment when data was acquired to avoid picking up AC ripples at 60 Hz and its multiples

length of 131,072 samples for the USB Oscilloscope 10. Two sets of data recorded when the entire system was still and pump turned off to establish the level of white noise and noise threshold 11.

2.4. Preparation of thin plate
For this experiment the clamped-free (or cantilevered) AISI316 (stainless steel) plate, 0.178mm thick X 36mm wide X 175mm long, was made from commercially available stainless steel shim flat pack 9 piece assortments manufactured by Maudlin & Son Mfg. Co., Inc., USA. The width of the plate was selected such that the flat sheet has negligible radius of curvature. The density of the plate was taken as 7900 kg/m3 and Young's modulus of elasticity was taken as 200 x 109 Nlm2 from manufacturer records complying withAMS 5524 and ASTM-A-666.
An aerofoil I pear shaped adapter machined out of Al6061 flats of 6.35mm thick X 38mm wide

X 54mm long two in number with four countersunk clearance holes and two M4 tapped holes.
These are clamped and the upstream ends were milled with a 6.35 mm radius cutter in order to minimize flow disturbance. Taper on both the faces then was milled in order to obtain an approximate pear I air foil shaped adapter. The clearance-hole pattern was transferred from the aluminum adapter to the stainless steel plate. Four M4 x 0.7 flat screws of predetermined length used to clamp the stainless steel plate to the pear shaped adapter as shown in Figure 2.4-1 . Silicon rubber epoxy is applied to downstream ends of the aluminum adapter in order to have a smooth transition for fluid flow from the adapter to the plate thus minimizing flow disturbances.

Selection o(Accelerometer: Measuring range from 0.5 Hz to 300Hz was considered as one of
the driving parameters in the selection of underwater accelerometer in addition to sensitivity, resolution and size. The thickness of the plate and the lateral vibrations dictated requirement of very light and thin accelerometer circuit board with a transducer slim enough to minimize flow disturbances and having minimal effect on the stiffness of the plate upon installation.

19

Figure 2.4-1 Isometric view of the permanent assembly of the cantilever plate to the aluminum adaptor with M4 flat head screws

Thus the ADXL335 from Analog Devices, a MEMS type thin and small with 4mm square by 1.45mm thick, 16-lead and plastic lead frame chip scale packaging features capable of measuring acceleration with a full-scale range of ±3 g, was selected in order to measure lateral vibrations.

The ADXL335 is a small and thin, low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with signal conditioned voltage outputs. It can also measure both dynamic acceleration (vibration) and static acceleration (gravity). The bandwidth of the accelerometer was established as 0.5 Hz to 1600Hz for the X, Y axes and 0.5 Hz to 550Hz for the Z axis using capacitors of0.01J..LF for the X, Y and Z axes as recommended in the data sheet given in Appendix C, to suit the application. A two-layer printed circuit board was designed using free printed circuit board (PCB) layout software from Express PCB (www.expresspcb.com) in order to manufacture in-house tiny 20

accelerometer circuit limiting size to -2mm thick x 9mm wide and 18mm long. The custom design of the sensor was required with flexible connections for the given plate thickness. In the market sensors to a slightly bigger in size with under water capability were quite expensive. Five long flexible multi strand wires of predetermined length were taken out of commercially available 60 conductor ribbon cable (multi wire planar cable) and soldered to the accelerometer to complete the circuit. All the three axes were connected along with power and ground wires. As per manufacturer guidelines and recommendations the ADXL335 type accelerometer though tested and specified at supply voltage, Vs = 3 V, however, it can be powered with Vs as low as 0.3 V or as high as 3.6 V. A DC supply of 3.0 V generated from of two 1.5 V AA batteries is provided to the accelerometer for two main reasons: · The benefit from the output that being ratiometric, so the sensitivity (or scale factor) varies proportionally to supply voltage. At Vs

= 3 V, the sensitivity is typically 270 mVIg

in each axis as per manufacturer specifications. These accelerometers have quite negligible variation in sensitivity due to change in temperature. · The output noise was not ratiometric but absolute in volts; therefore, the noise density decreases as the supply voltage increases. The reason being the scale factor (mVIg) increases while the noise voltage remains constant. At Vs = 3 V, the noise density 300

J.!gi.YHz in Z axis, as indicated in manufacturer's literature.
The sensitivity of the accelerometer was taken as 218 mVIg or 0.218 VIg or, in other words, equivalent to 4.6 gN or 45 mls 2N from the calibration (details provided in Appendix E) of both the transducers.

21

Cantilever plate setup with transducers: Two accelerometers along with the leads were installed
flat on the cantilever plate at a distance of 35 mm, approximately one fifth of the total plate length, from the clamp end. Prior to the installation, the undersides of the accelerometer boards were sanded to remove excess solder and a thin layer of the Amazing GOOP-Marine contact adhesive was applied. This thin layer acts as an insulator between the transducer board and the SS plate.

The accelerometers were glued to the stainless steel plate using Amazing GOOP-Marine contact adhesive meant for underwater applications manufactured by Eclectic Products, USA. Upon curing of the adhesive a multiple-layers transparent nail polish was applied on the transducer circuit board to make it water proof. To ensure further safety a thin layer of silicon rubber adhesive (Sil-Poxy from Smooth-On Inc., Easton, PA) was evenly applied on the top of the board and leads to provide minimum surface imperfections.

The leads were glued to the plate surface and carefully routed to the aluminum adapter. This was done in such a way that the five-single 28 gauge multi-strand wires have minimum effect on the flexural rigidity (Ep*I) of the cantilever plate. These wires were routed axially on the aluminum adapter using the above silicon rubber adhesive as shown below in Figure 2.4-2.

Two dummy transducer boards of identical dimensions were glued on the opposite side of the plate so as to minimize the flow disturbance caused by the raised surfaces of the real transducer boards.

Test fixture-Cantilever plate assemblv: A clear polycarbonate tube was designed and machined
much similar to the test fiXture used for the cantilever cylinder (further details provided in

22

Appendix A). The cantilevered plate was located axially along the test-fixture by tensioning the four stainless steel studs between the aluminum adapter and polycarbonate tube. Figure 2.4-3 shows the arrangement.

Experimental Setup:

This test-fixture- cantilever plate assembly inserted carefully in to the test section of the water pipe in the water-circulating test rig ensuring the orientation of the thickness of cantilever stainless plate normal to the vertical plane ensuring the orientation of the accelerometer normal to flow with a ±1.0° accuracy. The test-fixture - cantilever plate assembly was then secured rigidly with zero DOF by compression force provided by the mating flange to the pipe of the test section in the rig and the electrical leads are cautiously routed along the face of the flange.

The position of the cantilever plate was approximately 12.5 ft or 3.8 m downstream from the 90 degree bend in the rig to avoid flow separation and other sharp bend induced vortices. The fixture assembly along with transducer, leads and masking tapes on the studs inevitably induce wakes and other flow disturbances due to the setup design. The rig along with the test section was filled up with water at room temperature. The tank was filled with 450 gallons of water 24

ensuring the discharge immersed in water to minimize two phase flow. Figure 2.4-4 and Figure 2.4-5 show the setup.

Chapter 3 AXIAL FLOW INDUCED VIBRATION OF A CYLINDER
In this Chapter, a series of experiments were performed on a cylinder in axial flow. The motion of the cylinder was picked up using a MEMS-based accelerometer, sampled using a data acquisition system (HS4 ), and processed using MA TLAB. Temporal averages for a set of recorded data were determined to show that the flow induced vibration is random and ergodic in nature.

The time-domain rms accelerations of the cylinder motion are plotted against the mean flow velocity U rn/s for a wide range. In the frequency domain, the power spectra densities (PSD's) are obtained by means of fast Fourier transform for accelerations for a number of mean flow velocities corresponding to the controller frequencies from 2 Hz to 54 Hz. A total of 52 sets of data were recorded and analyzed. Because of the frequency limitation of the accelerometers, the PSD's are shown only for frequency range from 0 to 500Hz. Fortunately, the upper limit of 500Hz is sufficient for typical axial flow induced vibration problems in industry.

1.

Data Processing

From the volume flow meter reading, the mean flow velocity was calibrated for all achievable controller increments. Figure 3.1-1 shows the mean flow velocity versus the nominal pump shaft speed (half of the controller frequency) with and without the tank. The decrease in the mean flow velocity is due to work done by the pump on the raised head in the tank acting as a reservoir or sink.

Figure 3 .1-1 Flow velocity vs. pump speed in the test rig with and without the tank

The Temperature in the test rig filled with lukewarm water was 20°C with a kinematic viscosity
(~)of 1.004 x 10-6 m2/sin the pipe of 4.0 inch (101.6 mm) diameter. The Reynolds number for

the pipe flow (Re =

U*dp/~)

was 20,000 at a mean flow velocity of 0.2 m/s and 600,000 at a

mean flow velocity of 5.9 m/s.

Under the no flow condition, the signals from the accelerometers were recorded to establish a threshold value for noise. It was found that the noise generated by the entire system (including transducer and acquisition system) was ±0.2 mV or ±0.02 m/s 2 in terms of acceleration(= 2 mV

A typical window of time domain signal is presented in Figure 3.1-3 for the cylinder and the test rig for two different flow conditions U
=

1.0 m/s (or 5 Hz pump speed) and U

=

4.1 m/s (or 20

Hz pump speed). The significant increase in amplitudes at the two different flow velocities can be attributed to the flow turbulence, flow pulsations. Observations show that the response for the cylinder was different in X andY axes. This was due to the stainless steel strips placed in theY axis. For the test rig the signal in the X axis (tangential direction) is stronger than that in the Yaxis (radial direction- gravity comes into effect).

Figure 3.1-3 Typical response from the cylinder and the test rig with the tank

The RMS acceleration vs. flow velocity plots for both cylinder and test rig in the X and Y axes are plotted to study the impact of the flow velocity on the acceleration amplitude.

Plot in Figure 3.1-4 shows the effect of mean flow velocity on RMS acceleration in the X axis for cylinder in the test rig with and without tank. In case of test rig without tank when the flow velocity ramping from 1.6 m/s (or 7.5 Hz pump shaft speed) to 2.5 m/s (or 12.5Hz pump shaft speed, there is a spike in the rms response. This phenomenon is caused by the acoustic-structure resonance (2 x 7 x the pump speed, or second harmonics of 7-vane pump). The entire system has a resonant frequency of about 140 Hz.

While the same plot shows the effect of mean flow velocity on the rms acceleration in the X axis for cylinder in test rig with tank. Visual comparison of maximum ordinate values for cylinder response in both the configurations of test rig shows mean flow velocity as the driving parameter in increasing the acceleration.

Figure 3.1-5 show the similar behavior as observed above but for the Y axis of cylinder. The maximum ordinate values in these plots are less than that of the X axis due to the reason that cylinder has stainless steel strips embedded in Y axis all along the length increasing flexural rigidity in this axis. This plot for both test rigs with and without tank reiterates the significant contribution of mean flow velocity to the acceleration amplitude of the cylinder.

Figure 3.1-6 and shows test rig response in the X axis for both with tank and without tank configurations. The scale for the ordinate in this plot was much less compared to the flexible cylinder. Test rig without tank has many resonant modes and could be seen from the periodic increase in the rms values all along the flow velocity. The first one occurs when flow velocity was 1.5 m/s and 2.6 m/s. With the test rig re-designed with tank it was seen that the response changed as could be seen in the same plot. The maximum rms value in this system was achieved at a lower flow velocity in comparison with that of test rig without tank. In the process the bump seen in the previous test rig configuration was removed by providing rigid pipe clamps and supports.

The test rig response in the Y axis as shown in Figure 3.1-7 has lower levels of excitation as compared to that in the X axis. In all the four signal responses in the test rig without tank was observed in the flow velocity range of 1.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s. A noted increase in the rms acceleration in both axes for the test rig with tank at the maximum flow velocity could be due to large clearance holes on the supports used to tie down the piping with conventional clamps using bolts and nuts. From the 3D plots for both the axes shown below, it can be seen that mean flow velocity has a pronounced effect on increasing disturbance of the vibration amplitude in the current experimental setup. Figure 3.1-8 and Figure 3.1-10 show the relationship between the amplitude and the mean flow velocity in both the X and Y axis of cylinder in the test rig without tank. Figure 3.1-9 and Figure 3.1-11 show the similar effects of the mean flow velocity on the acceleration amplitude on a linear scale FFT in the frequency domain for the cylinder in the test rig with the tank.

It was seen that the amplitudes of vibration were much less in the test rig with the tank compared

to those without the tank. The test rig without the tank has higher mean flow velocities resulting in larger amplitudes of vibration of the cylinder. Due to work done by the pump on the raised head in the test rig with the tank, mean flow velocities were lower by approximately 27% when compared to the above resulting in much lower amplitudes of vibration.

So far, all these plots depict the combined effect of all the three main identified sources of . excitation. In subsequent sections, an effort was made to identify individual sources of excitation for a wide range of mean flow velocities.

3.2. Analysis of experiment data - flow induced vibrations
In this section, the response from the cylinder in both the axes was analyzed from the experimental data. The two sets of experimental data were collected with the cylinder subjected to FIV in the test rig with the tank and without the tank. In order to determine the natural frequencies of the cylinder an impact test was carried out as shown Figure 3.2-1 and Figure 3.2-2. The response from both the axes for the cylinder was analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Natural frequencies in both the axes with increasing mode numbers were identified from this test and similarities drawn between the spectra generated from the impact data and that from the fluid structure interaction due to flow through the test rig.

3.2.1. Cylinder X-axis
Analysis of impact test data: The Fourier transform of the impact data for the acceleration in the
X axis is shown in Figure 3.2-3 and it is clear that resonant frequencies are higher than those in water due to the absence of the added mass factor. The frequency response from the impact test shows the various sub-frequency bands in the overall range from 7Hz to 215Hz with a weak response at 300 Hz. First, second and other dominant modes are tabulated in the plot.

Analysis of experimental data: The response picked up by the accelerometer due to the cylinder
motion was processed in MATLAB using the autocorrelation and the Fourier transform function for acceleration for a wide range of mean flow velocities. Thus computed power spectral densities (PSD's) were plotted for further analysis. Figure 3.2-4, Figure 3.2-5 and Figure 3.2-6 show the acceleration response for the X axis in power spectral densities on a linear scale and the development of different modes with the increase in flow velocity in the test rig without the tank. These plots show the effect of turbulence (flow induced) on the approximate modal behavioral dynamics that change from first mode to higher harmonics. 39

The magnitudes of these modal amplitudes were dependent on the turbulence in flow which in tum is a function of the mean flow velocity.

It was also observed that the test rig without the tank has a large spike when the pump shaft operates between 7.5 Hz and 12.5 Hz speeds. The reason for this was the acoustic-structure resonance as mentioned in the previous section. The test rig system has a resonant frequency of approximately 140 Hz. Due to the lack of rigid supports and pipe clamps, this response was picked up by the embedded accelerometer in the cylinder in both axes, as this was integrated with the test rig. It was also observed that at these pump frequencies the response due to the flow induced vibration was dominated by the test rig resonance.

The pump delivers turbulent flow that was highly pulsational in the test rig without the tank. It was observed from the acceleration plots that the blade passing frequencies were dominant till the 20 Hz pump speed. The pump shaft frequency was strong and noticeable beyond the 20 Hz pump speed.

In the case of the test rig with the tank, the strength of the transducer signal from the cylinder was considerably lower than that observed in the test rig without the tank. This was due to reduced flow pulsations and increased work done by the pump. As a result, the mean flow velocity was reduced by 28% in the test rig with the tank.

As the flow velocity increases with pump speed, significant spikes were seen at around 7 Hz in the X axis of the cylinder. This was the fundamental natural frequency in the X axis of the cylinder and it develops in magnitude with subsequent pump speeds. The critical velocity was 0.4 m/s, at which the first mode was observed. The second natural frequency was seen developing in the X axis of the cylinder at 40 Hz, its magnitude increases with the increase in 43

flow velocity. The critical velocity was observed to be 0.7 m/s when the second natural frequency was observed. Close observation of modal dynamics in these plots shows that the second mode takes over the first at a flow velocity of 1.6m/s while higher modes develop and dominate in magnitude as the flow velocity increases. The third mode was observed to be around 86 Hz at a critical flow velocity of 1.15 m/s. The fourth mode at 102 Hz was observed at a critical velocity of 1.23 m/s. The fifth mode was observed around 138 Hz at critical velocity of 1.4 m/s. Around 196 Hz, the sixth mode was observed at a critical velocity of 1.5 m/s. The amplitudes of these six dominant modes increase with the increase in the flow velocity. Figure 3.2-7, Figure 3.2-8 and Figure 3.2-9 show the evolution of different modes of cylinder in X axis caused by turbulent flow in test rig with the tank. As the mean flow velocity increases the trend shifts from first mode to second and third resonant frequencies. At low mean flow velocities, the energy was concentrated in the first and second modes. At high mean flow velocities, the maximum concentration of energy was noticed in second, third and fourth modes. Again close observation of these figures shows the concentration of energy by a factor of 5 times in the test rig without the tank to that of the test rig with the tank. From the above analysis, the effect of mean flow velocity and hence turbulence on excitation of the higher resonant frequencies can be seen.

Figure 3.2-10 Cylinder-impact test results in theY axis

The offset in response between the X and Y axes can be attributed to the increase in flexural rigidity due to the presence of embedded stainless steel strips in the cylinder Y axis.
Analysis of experimental data: Figure 3.2-11 to Figure 3.2-16 shows the acceleration response

over the entire flow velocity spectrum in both test rigs with and without the tank. These plots show identical response with an exception that the magnitude in the test rig without the tank is higher than the test rig with the tank.

47

At flow velocity of 0.6 m/s the onset of first resonant frequency in the Y axis of cylinder which is at 20 Hz was noticed and its magnitude increases as the flow velocity increases. With flow velocity reaching 1.0 m/s the second mode occurs at 86 Hz just above the threshold noise level. When the flow reaches 1.3 m/s three more modes
at~

133Hz, 201 Hz and 310Hz make their

appearance above the noise threshold level. First mode peak amplitude attains maximum when the flow velocity reaches 1.5 m/s. The response of cylinder between 7.5 Hz and 12.5 Hz pump speeds was due to the acoustic-structure resonance. From these plots it was observed that the first mode has larger amplitude with respect to other higher modes. Due to embedded stainless steel strips the amplitude of all higher modes of cylinder was small.

Once again the flow pulsations play a dominant role as can be seen from the accumulation of energy spikes under various narrow bandwidths in the vicinity of natural frequencies of the cylinder in this axis. While the plot for test rig without tank shows the effect of energy from flow pulsations embedded in turbulent energy, spectral density plot in test rig with tank reflects predominantly turbulent energy. At higher mean flow velocities though, it was noticed that the blade passing frequencies appear in this plot. Similar to what was witnessed in the X axis; at135Hz the modal displacement shows a huge spike due to the acoustic-structure resonance.

Figure 3.2-14 Cylinder Y axis response in the test rig with the tank up to U = 1.2 m /s

From the above analysis for both the X and Y axes it can be seen that mean flow velocity has pronounced effect in increasing the disturbance and on the vibration amplitude in the cylinder. Turbulence buffeting was found to be the dominant mechanism for the forced excitations in both the X andY axes of cylinder in both the test rig configurations. 50

3.3. Flow pulsations - test rig response
Sources offlow pulsations: Pressure pulses are generated in almost any frequency of vibration of

the pump or piping from once per revolution up to the vane passing frequency and its harmonics. These pulses are harmonic forcing functions with well defined frequencies. The first blade passing frequency is equal to the number of blades multiplied by shaft rotation frequency. The prominent pulse usually occurs at the first, second or up to number of blades on the impeller. Pulsations are termed as noise in pumping systems generated by the mechanical motion of pump components and by the liquid motion in the pump and piping systems. These are caused by the impeller passing the discharge diffuser or some other discontinuity in the case. Any nonsymmetry of the internals of the pump may produce an uneven pressure distribution that can result in forces applied to the rotor there by causing unbalance in shaft rotation thereby generating pressure pulses [15]. The Table-3.3-1 shows the fundamental and higher harmonics of the pump impeller as the induction motor ramps up from 1 Hz to 28.5 Hz along with the measured responses from the accelerometer embedded on the test rig without tank. As observed from the table the pump delivers turbulent flow which is highly pulsational. Similar analysis was carried out on the test rig with tank and it was found that though the pump pulsations exist their signal was too weak for the transducer. This was due to two main reasons, one being introduction of tank in to the test rig system acting as a sink for dissipation of pressure pulsations and the second was the test rig pipes and pipe supports were anchored rigidly with secure pipe clamps.

3.3.1. Test rig without and with the tank- X axis: From the Table-3.3-1 it was seen that the measured first blade passing frequency was lagging behind its theoretical counterpart. This can be explained as the combined effect of load on the pump shaft and frequency resolution in data processing. The frequency resolution in the present experiment was 0.15 Hz with a sampling rate of 10,000 Hz and a record length of 131,072 samples.

The experimental shaft frequency was back calculated by dividing the measured first blade passing frequency with number of vanes (in this case the pump impeller has 7 vanes). The reason for back calculating the shaft frequency was due to the dominant first blade passing frequency at all the shaft speeds during entire experiment in test rig without tank. At various mean flow velocities Fourier transform for acceleration showed dominant peaks. The subsequent columns on the experiment side in the table explain the measured shaft frequency and its multiples.

From 1 Hz to 14Hz theoretical pump speed as shown in Figure 3.3.1-1 the shaft frequency was not as dominant as compared to the first blade passing frequency. While from 15 Hz to 28 Hz theoretical pump speed the signal for measured shaft frequency, 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X, 6X, 7X and higher multiples of shaft frequency were quite strong depicting the pulsational nature of flow.

Between 7.5 Hz and 12.5 Hz the test rig has acoustic-structure resonance at around 140 Hz as identified in previous sections. As the pump speed increases the flow pulses were observed in the test rig at all the blade passing frequencies and their harmonics.

The flow pulsations from the pump rotation and blade passing frequencies were significantly lower in the test rig with tank as seen in Figure 3.3.1-2.

3.3.2. Test rig without and with the tank- Y axis:
It was observed for the test rig that in the radial plane (the Y axis) the flow pulsations were

stronger as compared to their counter parts in the tangential plane (the X axis). Similar to electrical noise the flow pulsations have very low damping and they appear as narrow spikes in these plots thus making them easily distinguishable from other structural vibrations. The plot for the rig without tank in Figure 3.3.2-3 shows fundamental blade passing frequency and its higher harmonics with 7X being predominant. The spikes in the plots show that test rig exposed to flow turbulence thereby experience resonant vibration at all its natural frequencies.

Figure 3.3.2-4 Response from the test rig in theY axis- with the tank

Figure 3.3.2-4 shows the response of test rig with tank. As the mean flow velocity increases from 2.0 m/s the signal of fundamental blade passing frequency grows stronger. The clamps used to secure the pipe were fastened with larger clearance holes on the rigid support and this explains the flow pulsations at higher pump speeds were recorded by the accelerometer in this axis.

Chapter 4 AXIAL FLOW INDUCED VIBRATION OF A THIN PLATE
In this Chapter, a series of experiments were performed on a plate in axial flow. The motion of the plate was picked up using MEMS-based tri-axial accelerometers installed at a distance of one-fifth of the length from the fixed end, sampled using a data acquisition system (HS4), and processed using MA TLAB. Two transducers glued to the plate with the measuring axis parallel to plate thickness were called as X 1 at top and X2 in the bottom.

The time-domain rms accelerations of the plate motion are plotted against the mean flow velocity
U mls for a wide range. In the frequency domain, the power spectral densities (PSD's) are

obtained by performing the Fourier transform on the autocorrelation of accelerations for a number of mean flow velocities corresponding to the controller frequencies from 3 Hz to 40 Hz.

Three sets of data were recorded at the 16 Hz pump speed with 5 kHz, 10 kHz and 20 kHz sampling rates. Figure 4-1 shows the random vibration of the plate in the time-domain for a given pump speed and Figure 4-2 shows the frequency-domain demonstrating similar response at different sampling rates. Considering the process of flow induced vibrations an ergodic process, a sampling rate of 5kHz with a record length of 65,536 samples was selected and a set of 38 data files recorded from the transducers.

Because of the frequency limitation of the accelerometers, the plots are shown only for the frequency range from 0 to 500 Hz. Coincidentally, an upper limit of 500 Hz is sufficient for understanding low-frequency plate behavior in axial flow. Most of the industrial applications have seen low frequency applications or problems. 59

From the no flow condition, the signals from the accelerometers were recorded to establish a threshold value for noise. Figure 4-3 shows the noise generated by the entire system (including of transducer, power supply, leads and data acquisition system). The noise was quite negligible and was around ±0.1 m V or ±0.0 1 m/s2 in terms of acceleration.

Analysis of impact test data: A rubber mallet was used to strike gently on the test rig pipe support
at various locations close to the plate specimen, shown in Figure 4-4, to carry out the impact test as shown by arrows in Figure 4-5. As the test was done in air with no water in the test rig, the spectrum in the frequency domain showed higher resonating frequencies due to the absence of the added mass effect. The time-domain plot for the impact test is shown in Figure 4-6. The plate has few resonant frequencies between in a bandwidth of32 Hz to 350Hz as seen from the power spectral density plot shown in Figure 4-7. Much noticeable peaks were at 33 Hz and 64 Hz. 61

Acceleration response in time-domain at various speeds was shown in the Figure 4-10 . Please note the scale for ordinate was not adjusted in order to present the magnitude of acceleration and its dependency with the flow velocity. A close observation of the below plot shows that the development of peak-peak acceleration magnitude from ~0.5 m/s 2 at 0.3 m/s flow velocity to 50 m/s 2 at 3.4 m/s flow velocity.

Figure 4-11 and Figure 4-12 show the time-domain response for the accelerometers X 1 and X2 on common scale. It was observed that the influence of flow velocity was quite significant on the magnitude of acceleration amplitude. From these plots it was evident that the 100 fold increase in magnitude of acceleration amplitude for an approximately ten fold increase in flow velocity.

Figure 4·12 Acceleration responses in the time·domain- X2 accelerometer on the ordinate common scale

Following the similar responses from both the accelerometers ongoing analysis was carried out considering one accelerometer. Figure 4-13 to Figure 4-18 depicts the behavior of natural frequencies of cantilever plate from the mean flow velocity of 0.6 m/s (or pump speed 4 Hz) to 3.4 m/s (or pump speed 20Hz). As the flow velocity increases the dynamic response of the plate changes drastically from zero acceleration to almost 3 m/s 2 · The different modes were seen with increasing magnitude as seen successive power spectral density plots. The results were similar to that of the cantilever cylinder where the amplitude of successive modes increases at their respective critical flow velocities. But one strong observation was made as the flow increases beyond 3.0 m/s where in the amplitude of lower modes diminish while that of higher mode (100 Hz in this case) increases. A secondary peak at 270 Hz was also observed at the high flow velocities.

Figure 4-18 PSD at U=3.4 m/s

The first mode was observed around 15 Hz at the mean flow velocity of 0.48 m/s above the noise threshold. This mode reaches maximum amplitude at the mean flow velocity of 1.6 m/s before being taken over by the subsequent modes. The second mode was observed around 54 Hz at the mean flow velocity of0.6 m/s and achieves maximum amplitude at the mean flow velocity of 3.2 m/s. The third mode was observed picking up around 100 Hz at 0.6 m/s mean flow velocity. This mode was the most dominant mode over the entire experiment. The fourth mode was observed picking up around 140 Hz at mean flow velocity of 1 m/s. In the process a 30 Hz band was generated around this mode implying existence of few modes embedded in this frequency band. The fifth mode was observed around 205Hz at the mean flow velocity of 1.1 m/s. The sixth mode was observed to be picking up around 273 Hz at the mean flow velocity of 0.82 m/s. 72

With the turbulence being a function of mean flow velocity the modal instability increases with the increase in the turbulence. The mechanism beyond these wide band frequency response due to flow can be explained as follows. The restoring force in the plate is flexural rigidity while the tension in the plate adds to the pressure perturbation. The effect of damping force increases with flow velocity up to certain value and then its effect reduces while the flow turbulence takes over the system. Wide band response at high flow velocity. shows the effect of turbulence [3]. A strange phenomenon was observed that seems to be unique to the plate dynamics. Beyond the mean flow velocity of 2.3 m/s all the modal excitations were overwhelmed by the turbulence in flow. Around the third mode i.e., 100 Hz the system extracts energy around its natural frequency and hence peak observed. It can be said that few modes co-exist around this frequency resulting in the wide band excitation 70 Hz to 130 Hz. It was observed the amplitude of the first, second and third modes dominate over the entire power density spectrums. While the similar explanation could be tendered for the accumulation of turbulent energy over a large band width from 0 Hz to 150 Hz with peaks at the modal frequencies. The cantilever plate extracts energy from the turbulent flow in the vicinity of its modal frequencies resulting increase in amplitude. Another observation is that the power spectral density plot in Figure 4-18 shows the energy concentration around 100Hz with a wide band of turbulent energy between 10Hz and 300Hz. Though this power spectral density is intended for continuous spectra the peaks in the spectra do not reflect the power at a given frequency but these plots provide an idea to an extent about the energy content.

73

Finally a 3D plot with power spectral density, mean flow velocity and frequency as the respective axes was shown in Figure 4-19 to visualize the Fluid-Structure interaction with the flow developing around the plate.

Figure 4-19 Acceleration amplitude vs. flow velocity vs. frequency

From the above analysis of responses of the cantilever plate it can be seen that the effect of mean flow velocity on excitation of the various resonant frequencies. Also the magnitudes of these resonating frequencies were directly proportional to the mean flow velocity. With the increase in the mean flow velocity it was seen that the plate vibration becomes unstable. This was clear from these plots the excitation of wide band of frequencies at higher mean flow velocities. In contrast to cylinder experiment where multiple modes still exist with increasingly stronger amplitude, in the plate experiment it was observed that beyond a critical mean flow velocity (3.0 m/s in this case) the plate tends to come to an equilibrium position which in this case was around 100 Hz.

Chapter 5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
5.1 Conclusions
In this thesis, the axial pipe flow induced vibrations of a beam and a plate are investigated experimentally. Use of MEMS based transducers allows the direct and accurate measurement of acceleration without altering the flows surrounding the transducers. A large number of experiments covering the two structures, a test rig without and with a large water tank for reducing the acoustic-induced vibrations, were carried out over a wide range of mean flow velocities. These comprehensive studies and experimental results are useful to power and process industries where pipe flow induced vibrations in various components (e.g., butterfly valves) are often encountered. The flow in the test rig with and without the tank was both turbulent and pulsational at all pump speeds. At 27Hz pump speed for the cantilever cylinder the mean flow velocity was 5.7 m/s in the test rig without the tank and the magnitude of rms acceleration in the X axis was 4.3g while in theY axis it was 3.3g. For the same pump speed the mean flow velocity was 4.7 m/s in the test rig with the tank and the maximum values of rms acceleration in the X andY axes were 1.5g to 2g for the cylinder. It was noticed that the active frequency band for the cylinder where resonances occur for different modes in the X axis was from 7 Hz till 200 Hz. The response of the cylinder in the Y axis was different from that of the X axis due to the presence of steel strips acting as stiffeners. The active frequency band where resonances occur for different modes in the cylinder Y axis was from 19 Hz to 360 Hz. These results show the turbulent flow causes excitation of first and higher modes in both the axes for the cylinder.

75

For the cantilever plate the maximum rms acceleration was approximately 2g at 3.4 m/s mean flow velocity. Vibrations observed in the cantilever plate can be categorized as high-frequency low-amplitude type that was observed as common phenomenon in thinner plates. These plots depict the evolution of the plate higher modes as mean flow velocity increases. The flow upstream to plate is highly turbulent and the radial studs holding the plate in the fixture-adaptor make the flow further more complex. The flow turbulence is the driving mechanism for these vibrations as was seen from energy concentration over wide band frequency from 10 Hz to 200
Hz.

5.2 Future Work
Developing a computational fluid dynamics model for simulating the three dimensional flow surrounding the flexible structures in an axial pipe flow is recommended.

Preparation of cylinder

A length of 220 mm of 12.7 mm diameter silicon rubber chord stock was cut to ensure minimum radius of curvature when in free state and ends are ensured square to the longitudinal axis. A hole of 8.2 mm diameter was drilled for 5 mm deep along the axis at one end using an end mill at high spindle speed. Along longitudinal axis two grooves were sliced for 4mm deep for a length of 152.5 mm with a professional stainless steel knife on either side of the XOZ plane along the Y axis as shown in the Figure A.l-1.

Figure A.l-1 Sectional view of silicon rubber cylinder after machining

Two thin strips of 3.9 mm wide by 152.5 mm long were cut from 0.010 in. thick shim stock of AISI316 (stainless steel) manufactured by Maudlin & Sons Mfg Co., Inc., Texas. A thin layer of silicon rubber adhesive (Sil-Poxy from Smooth-On Inc., Easton, PA) was evenly applied on either side of these strips. These strips were then carefully inserted in to the groves made on the silicon rubber cylinder specimen as shown in Figure A.l-2. (Sil-Poxy, the silicon rubber adhesive is a one-component adhesive made specifically for bonding RTV silicone rubber to silicone rubber and other materials with a work time of 5 minute and cure time of 12 minutes).

77

Figure A.l-2 Isometric view of silicon rubber cylinder with SS Strips

A 16 mm diameter by 40 mm long fixture was machined from 20 mm diameter Al 6061 bar stock with an axial hole of 12.7 mm diameter by 25 mm deep drilled on one end while a hole drilled through the remaining length and tapped with UNC 1/4 in. threads. Commercially available five minute epoxy prepared and applied evenly inside the surface of this 12.7 mm diameter hole and the silicon rubber cylinder with the blunt end inserted in to this hole allowing the epoxy to cure thus forming rigid joint between the fixture and silicon rubber cylinder. An adapter machined out of AI 6061 with 16 mm diameter by 50 mm long with four M4x0.7 radial holes tapped through all the wall thickness. This was then clamped to the fixture-silicon rubber cylinder using a Y4 in-20 socket cap screw of 7/8 inch long as shown in Figure A.1-3. Figure A.1-4 shows the layout of the accelerometer at the free end and the four ribbon cables lay out along the longitudinal axis. Figure A.1-5 shows the cantilever cylinder along with the test 78

fixture and the transducer installed. The harnesses were routed in such a way that they contribute minimal flow disturbance.

Preparation of thin plate

For this experiment, the clamped-free or cantilevered AISI316 (stainless steel) plate, 0.178mm thick X 36mm wide X 175mm long. Four M4 clearance holes at a predetermined pattern using the pear shaped plates were drilled on the plate. Figure A.2-l shows the manufacturing and assembly of the stainless steel plate. The assembly contains two half pear shaped aluminum plates clamping the plate with the help of M4x0. 7 socket head flat screws.

Figure A.2-1 Front view of text-fixture assembly with cantilever plate

Test-fixture for cantilever plate: In order to place the cantilever plate along the axis of the test
section of pipe in the water circulating test rig, a simple test-fixture was designed with a 4 inch (101.6 mm) outside diameter (OD) and 3Yz inch (88.9 mm) inside diameter (ID) of3.5 inch (88.9 mm) polycarbonate tube. The OD of the tube was machined down to 100 mm diameter for a 80

length of 86 mm leaving a shoulder so that it can slide into the test section of the pipe without interference. Two radial holes drilled through all the wall thickness of the tube and tapped with M4x0.7 threads at a predetermined position(s) by transferring the clearance-hole pattern from the pear shaper aluminum adapter. The process was accomplished on a milling machine using an indexing head.

The cantilever plate - aluminum adapter was then secured along the axis of the tube with the help of four M4x0.7 stainless steel studs and four pairs of M4x0.7 hexagonal nuts with an endeavor to achieve zero DOF at the fixed end of the cantilever as shown in Figure A.2-2.

Tensile test results and technical data for Silicone 70 cord stock
The density of the material was determined by using two samples of different cut lengths and weighed on an electronic balance with least count of 1 micro gram obtaining three readings each. Average density was found to be 1590.5 Kg/m 3 · Similarly, a tensile test was carried out on a United Testing Systems machine of 50 kN capacity. Extensiometer was set to 2 inch in length and attached to the silicon rubber chord stock of 8 inch-long specimen and clamped in the jaws while the specimen was subjected to axial load. Application of load was continued till the specimen failed while the extensiometer was removed at 20% strain and the data was plotted to construct the stress-strain curve. Numerically a linear regression was carried on the data and a best fit curve plotted as shown in below Figure D-1. Young' s modulus of elasticity was determined to be 1006.6 PSi- 6.94 MPa

Calibration process and charts for the bi- and tri-axial accelerometers

E.l

Calibration of bi-axial accelerometer for cylinder

A Dytran Instruments Inc. make calibrator (model 5350) was used to calibrate accelerometers at constant frequency, i.e., 1OOHz for various amplitudes. The calibration setup contained a fixed frequency shaker unit (model5350), a data acquisition system comprising a laptop (Oscilloscope software loaded) along USB Oscilloscope - Handyscope HS4 with 4 channels, sampling 195.3125 kHz at 16 bit resolution (from TiePie engineering, Netherlands), a 4.5 V DC battery pack with four port terminal strip and two Coaxial cables with BNC connectors on one end and the other end open. Each accelerometer was mounted on the shaker head using bees wax while ensuring the axis coincident to shaker axis being calibrated. This was achieved by aligning the sides of square face of the accelerometer parallel I perpendicular to shaker base manually within ±1.0° accuracy. The positive and negative wires connected to that of battery pack with the help of terminal strip. Similarly the XOUT and YOUT from the accelerometer are connected to channel I and channel 2 of the oscilloscope through terminal strip and coaxial cables as shown in Figure E.l-1 and Figure E.l-2. With the oscilloscope connected to laptop through USB cable, the shaker was excited at various acceleration levels starting from 0.1g (PK) to 3.0g (PK). A total of 16 sets of readings were taken for each axis and the data processed for determining the sensitivity of accelerometer. The Figure E.l-3 and Figure E.1-4 show the linear response of accelerometer for various 'g' levels.

Calibration of tri-axial accelerometer for thin plate

The calibration setup was similar to what was carried out above. The accelerometer was mounted on the shaker head using bees wax while ensuring the X-axis coincident to shaker axis. This was achieved by placing the board flat on the shaker base. The positive and negative wires connected to that of battery pack with the help of terminal strip. Similarly, the XOUT from the accelerometer are connected to channel 2 of the oscilloscope through terminal strip and coaxial cables as shown in Figure E.2-l and Figure E.2-2.

Figur E.2-2 Close-up view of calibration of tri-axial accelerometer for cantilever plate in one axis

With the oscilloscope connected to laptop through USB cable the shaker was excited at various acceleration levels starting from 0.1g (PK) to 2.8g (PK). A total of 19 sets of readings were taken and the data processed for determining the sensitivity of accelerometer in only X axis. The procedure was repeated for two accelerometers. Figure E.2-3 and Figure E.2-4 show the linear response of accelerometer for various 'g' levels.
