A MODEL-BASED APPROACH TO MEASURING DENITRIFICATION AND GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION IN LAKES
Juliet Falco Ajambo-Doherty Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2009

Abstract An existing whole-system model based on changes in dissolved N2 concentration was modified for lentic systems. Field validation was carried out at Christie Lake in Dundas, ON and Turtle Pond in Stoney Creek, ON (Canada). New model inputs included air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind velocity, and Schmidt number. Monte Carlo analysis was integrated into the model to better constrain error in model estimates of denitrification, whole-system metabolism, and greenhouse gas production. Denitrification rates ranged from -419-4415 J..Lmol N.m- 2.h- 1 in Christie Lake and from 10-74 J..Lmol N.m- 2.h- 1 in Turtle Pond. N 20 production ranged from 915-10,635 nmol N.m- 2.h- 1 in Christie Lake and from -344-131 nmol N.m- 2.h- 1 in Turtle Pond. The whole-system model allows for the examination of biogeochemical processes at ecologically significant temporal and spatial scales.

CHAPTER! INTRODUCTION
A US National Research Council Report in 2000 asked the question "What links such seemingly diverse problems as red tides, fish kills, outbreaks of shellfish poisonings, degradation of water quality, coral reef destruction, and the Gulf of Mexico's 'dead zone'?" (National Research Council, 2000), concluding that the answer was nitrogen. Transforming elemental nitrogen to an available form of reactive nitrogen (Nr) requires a significant amount of energy in order to break the triple bond that holds the two N atoms together.

Biological Nitrogen Fixation
N2 + 8H+ + 8e- + 16 ATP
nitrog.e

2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16 Pi

Only a small number of specialized nitrogen fixing microbes are able to perform biological nitrogen fixation and until recently, this greatly limited the amount of Nr in the aquatic environment (Galloway et al., 2003). However, the introduction of Nr at local, regional, and global scales by anthropogenic sources now exceeds the rate of biological nitrogen fixation in natural ecosystems (Galloway et al., 2003; Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006; Paerl, 2006). The environmental increase of Nr is due primarily to N fertilizer production and fossil fuel combustion used to support the food and energy demands of human population growth (Rabalais, 2002; Galloway et al., 2003; Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006; Groffnlan et al., 2009b).

The amount of anthropogenic Nr has increased up to 50 times from historical levels, from 15 to 165 Tg of N per year, for the period between 1860 and 2000. This has resulted in negative effects on both human and environmental health (Bernot et al., 2003; Galloway et al., 2003).

Nutrient Loading

Figure 1.1 Relationship of production/fishery yield and increased nutrient loading (Rabalais, 2002).

Increases in Nr have been shown to cause: respiratory illness, cancer, and cardiac disease in humans due to the aerosols formed; acidification and loss of biodiversity in lakes and streams; and eutrophication, hypoxia, loss of biodiversity, and habitat degradation in coastal ecosystems (Galloway et al., 2003). Nutrient loading, in general, has contributed to trophic enrichment of many aquatic ecosystems, including many with globally important fisheries (Figure 1.1). Of the ten ecosystems listed in Figure 1.1, N loading is believed most directly responsible for trophic status change in eight (phosphorus loading has been the primary cause of eutrophication in the Laurentian Great Lakes). Nr is now regarded as the principal anthropogenic threat to coastal ecosystems (Howarth et al., 2000; National Research Council, 2000; Rabalais, 2002; Galloway et al. , 2003).

The
Nitrogen NH. Cascade

Figure 1.2. Nitrogen cascade (modified from Rabalais, 2002).

Nitrogen and phosphorus are most commonly the limiting nutrients in coastal ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems, respectively, but it is the ratio of the two that determines the relative importance of each in limiting primary production in a variety ecosystems such as lakes, reservoirs, and streams (Reeky et al., 1993; Cornwell et al., 1999; National Research Council, 2000; Rabalais, 2002; Hessen et al., 2004; Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006). The Redfield ratio is the molecular ratio of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in phytoplankton biomass (106 C:15 N:1 P) when nutrients are not limiting (Redfield, 1934). Marine and estuarine ecosystems are often N-limited because the N:P ratio is typically below the Redfield ratio of 15:1, thus nitrogen is relatively more limiting for growth (production of new biomass). Freshwater ecosystems are commonly P-limited because the N:P ratio is greater than the Redfield ratio of 15:1, thus P is relatively more limiting for growth. Surface freshwater ecosystems play a role in the movement

3

of reactive forms of nitrogen and phosphorus from land and waterscapes towards estuaries and the coastal ocean (Figure 1.2) (Rabalais, 2002; Galloway et al., 2003). Since estuarine primary productivity is characteristically limited by Nr, nitrate (N03- ) overloading results in major perturbations in coastal ecosystems (Drescher and Brown, 2006). Thus, nitrogen represents the largest pollution problem in coastal waters and a great threat to coastal ecosystems (Howarth et al., 2006).

1.1.1

Nutrient Management

The desire to bolster and maintain healthy interactions between ecosystems and social systems has resulted in calls for further research and the advocacy of management practices that focus on this goal (Carpenter et al., 1999). One possible solution to nitrogen loading is to decrease anthropogenic sources. Programs such as the Helsinki Commission for the Baltic Sea, the Oslo-Paris Commission for the North Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay Program have been established in an effort to decrease nutrient over-enrichment. However, efforts such as these are often based on poorly informed goals of specific percentage reduction, without knowing what amount of reduction would really be effective and the time that such action would take (Boesch, 2002). Without understanding how nitrogen is processed during transport within a drainage network, it is difficult to develop an effective plan to achieve a reduction target. In order for legislation and reduction programs to be effective, an understanding of the processes involved, as well as the biogeochemistry of the system in question is required. To produce legislation that is meaningful, we need to be able to predict how biogeochemical processes will occur. Only then can we develop unique nutrient management plans applicable to differing and individual systems.

4

Nutrient management practices require a sound knowledge of the nutrient cycles that take place in the system being protected (Cornwell et al., 1999). In the case of nitrogen overenrichment, it is practical to know that not all of the excess Nr released into the environment makes its way to coastal waters; some portion is removed by denitrification (Boesch, 2002). Nutrient management practices can be geared towards enhancing the conversion of Nr to nitrogen gas in both aquatic and terrestrial systems (Boesch, 2002; Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006; Seitzinger et al., 2006). Enumerating rates of denitrification is critical in order to predict the effects of agricultural and industrial land-use changes on downstream ecosystems. Yet many methods for measuring denitrification have been found to have large uncertainties, therefore the amount of Nr that is converted back to N2 during denitrification and anammox is one of the largest uncertainties of the N cycle (Galloway et al., 2004; Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006; Bohlke et al., 2009).

1.2

Denitrification
Classical Denitrification N03--+ N02--+ NO-+ N20-+ N2 (g)

Multiple processes are involved in nitrogen cycling in aquatic systems and these include nitrogen fixation, nitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA}, anammox and denitrification (Figure 1.3) (Saunders and Kalff, 2001; Francis et al., 2007). The removal of nitrogen and its products from the water column occurs by such processes as denitrification, sediment sorption, and plant/microbial uptake. However, of these processes, denitrification is the only permanent mechanism of nitrogen removal converting it to the form of nitrogen gas and nitrous oxide. Nitrogen gas and nitrous oxide are lost from the water column through reequilibration with the atmosphere.

5

Figure 1.3. Nitrogen cycle (Francis et al., 2007).

Denitrification, the anaerobic reduction of nitrogen oxides (N03 and N02) to nitrogenous gases (NO, N 20 and N 2), is an important Nr sink in the global nitrogen budget, especially in waters with high concentrations of anthropogenic nutrients and ultimately determines N availability (Seitzinger, 1988; Cornwell et al., 1999; Bemot et al., 2003; Drescher and Brown, 2006;
Soils
Land-based Inputs -270TgN/y

Pifia-Ochoa and Alvarez-Cobelas, 2006; Gruber and Galloway et al., 2008; Bohlke et al., 2009). As water travels through a drainage network from wetlands and headwater streams to larger streams and rivers, passing through network lakes, and ultimately estuaries and coastal ocean, nitrogen is cycled among its various forms and there is great potential for loss of Nr from the biosphere due to
Figure 1.4. Decrease of nitrogen transfer due to denitrification (modified from Galloway et al., 2003; Seitzinger et al., 2006).

denitrification (Galloway et al., 2003 ; Bohlke et al., 2009) (Figure 1.4). Characterizing denitrification through precise and accurate methods of measurement is essential to understanding how ecosystems handle increased N loads (Bemot et al., 2003 ; Drescher and Brown, 2006).

What is known is that denitrification requires carbon and nitrate as substrates, the absence or scarcity of oxygen, is influenced by phosphorus content, temperature, and light, and that it occurs in almost all ecosystems including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic (Seitzinger, 1988; Galloway, 2003; Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006; Groffinan et al., 2009b). In aquatic ecosystems, denitrification predominantly occurs in the top 2-5 em of the sediment layer which is often anoxic below the first few millimeters, even if the overlying water is well oxygenated (Galloway, 2003). Empirical models also suggest that hydrologic characteristics, such as depth (Smith et al, 1997; Alexander et al., 2000), discharge (Alexander et al., 2002a), and water residence time (Alexander et al., 2000; Alexander et al., 2002b; Howarth et al., 2006; Seitzinger et al., 2006) affect nitrogen loss, presumably through denitrification. Laursen and Seitzinger (2004) found site-specific relationships between discharge and denitrification, measured explicitly as N 2 production. However, while advances in whole-system measurements of denitrification have given us the ability to study river reaches (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a; McCutchan et al., 2003) and salt wedges moving inland in estuaries (Kana et al., 2006), studies still lack reliable quantitative estimates of denitrification rates at ecologically relevant temporal and spatial scales across landscapes and waterscapes (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006; Seitzinger, 2006).

7

Why study lakes?
The residence time of water (Howarth et al., 2006), and more specifically, residence time I depth (Seitzinger et al., 2006) is an important factor controlling the amount of Nr removal achieved in aquatic systems. The effect of water residence time is directly related to the reaction time that bacteria in sediments have to convert Nr to various nitrogenous forms before it is transported to an adjacent downstream system (Galloway et al., 2003). Not surprisingly then, a smaller proportion of the Nr inputs are retained in a river reach (5% to 20%) compared with many lakes and reservoirs (1 0% to ,....,90%) resulting in greater amounts of Nr conversion to N gas in lakes and reservoirs (Galloway et al., 2003). Due to their relatively long water residence time, and the resulting opportunity for enhanced particle settling and nutrient processing, lakes are recognized as systems where extensive denitrification and N burial can occur (Harrison, 2009). Model runs for the mid-1990s indicate that lentic systems are indeed important sinks for N, with small lakes (,...,50 km2) representing half the global total for conversion of Nr to N 2 via denitrification (Groffman et al., 2009b ).

These models of Nr removal are based on total N removal, with most estimates based on N mass balance, rather than explicit measurements of denitrification, as the tools do not yet exist to measure denitrification in lakes at a whole system scale. Given this, we cannot yet say whether lakes are acting as long-term temporary sinks of N, reservoirs that can return N to the drainage network, or as permanent sinks within networks, removing N by denitrification. Further, without the tools to assess denitrification at the whole-lake scale, we cannot determine what other aspects of lakes (i.e. physical, chemical, and biological factors) are important determinants ofN-loss via

8

denitrification in these potentially important sinks. Knowing the importance of these other determinants will be crucial in developing effective nitrogen export reduction plans.

1.2.1

Measuring denitrification

A number of approaches have been applied in aquatic and marine systems to detect the production of N2 due to denitrification. These approaches fall into two general categories: enclosure experiments designed to measure N2 fluxes and open system measurements of ambient N2 (Groffman et al., 2006). Both approaches measure net denitrification which is the difference between gross denitrification and gross N fixation (Groffman et al., 2006).

Denitrification is a difficult process to measure accurately due to: methodological limitations, its high spatial and temporal variability, the high background concentration in the aquatic environment of its dominant end product, N2, and the involvement of several forms of nitrogen as reactants and products in denitrification and other nitrogen cycle processes which complicates accounting of fluxes (Cornwell et al., 1999; Groffman et al., 2006; Tonitto et al., 2009). Heterogeneity in the variables that control for denitrification in both space and time results in the great heterogeneity observed in denitrification rates (Kulkarni et al., 2008; Bohlke et al., 2009). Current methods used to measure denitrification are problematic for a variety of reasons: they change the substrate concentrations of reactants (e.g. nitrate or carbon), they disturb the physical environment that the process occurs in (e.g. flow of water across surface, and therefore diffusive delivery of oxygen and nitrate), they lack sensitivity, or they are prohibitively costly in time (e.g. N mass balance) and expense (e.g. large-scale

N tracer experiments)

1.2.1.1

Enclosure Experiments

Enclosure experiments are typically used for studies involving the sediment layer, the primary site of denitrification activity (Groffman et al., 2006). In aquatic systems, the method usually involves either an in situ approach with benthic chambers (e.g. Ryden et al., 1979; Devol, 1991; Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002b) or an ex situ approach with sediment cores (e.g. Seitzinger et al., 1980; Seitzinger et al., 1993; Joye and Pearl, 1994; Seitzinger and Giblin, 1996; Kana et al., 1998; Cornwell et al., 1999; An et al., 2001) with dissolved N 2 concentrations in the overlying water column measured repeatedly through time. The N 2 flux is determined from the rate of change in N2 concentration determined from
~N2 :Ar (~N2).

If nitrogen to argon ratio (N2:Ar) data are used,

~N2

is

(Kana et al., 1994; Groffman et al., 2006). Rates that are determined in

centimeter and hour scale experiments must be extrapolated to kilometer and month scales for ecosystem studies of denitrification resulting in built-in uncertainty at assessing the environmental heterogeneity of the system (Groffman et al., 2006; McCutchan et al., 2003). An alternative approach that integrates large scale systems is the in situ measurement ofN2 in open systems where water samples are taken from the environment in question (Groffman et al., 2006).

1.2.1.2

Open system approach

In situ measurement studies involve the measurement of N 2 in ambient water produced by
denitrification. The difficulty lies in the high background aqueous concentration of N 2

10

(equilibrium concentrations in freshwater are 449 and 822 Jlmol/L for 30°C and 0°C, respectively) and consideration of physical processes related to mixing, air exchange, and water volume in contact with the area of denitrification (Grof:fman et al., 2006). Several different systems have been studied using in situ N2 :Ar measurements beginning with Richards and Benson (1961) in the marine environment followed by Codispoti et al. (200 1). While these studies noted N 2 :Ar anomalies and attributed these anomalies to denitrification, no attempts were made to model denitrification from these anomalies. Anomalies in N 2 :Ar, specifically temporal changes in these anomalies in a parcel of water, were first used for denitrification estimates in open-systems by Laursen and Seitzinger (2002a) in a model-based approach that accounted for re-equilibration of dissolved gases. A similar study used time-series measurements of diel N 2:Ar concentrations measured at a single location, correcting for air exchange and groundwater discharge (McCutchan et al., 2003). Denitrification based on this basic modeling approach has since been measured in a variety of lotic systems (e.g. Laursen and Seitzinger, 2004; Yan et al., 2004; .Kana et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2008), however until this study no model-based approach has been adapted to lentic systems.

1.2.1.3

Technology

Measurement technologies play an important role in these studies and dissolved N2 has been measured using gas chromatography coupled with a thermal conductivity detector (GCTCD) and mass spectrometry (MS) (Grof:fman et al., 2006). The availability of inexpensivelypriced mass spectrometers that offer much higher precision and the development of membrane inlet interfaces to allow direct extraction of gases from water samples has resulted in MS being used more frequently than GC-TCD (Grof:fman et al., 2006). However, advances in the direct

11

quantification of denitrification are often slow coming due to a lack of knowledge transfer between scientists of different disciplines or the inhibitory effect of cost (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006). Although measurements of N2:Ar in open systems go back to the 1950s (Richards and Benson, 1961 ), the mass spectrometry technique was not available to many laboratories until very recently (Groffman et al., 2006). GC measurements of dissolved N2 were applied in the 1960s (Reeburgh, 1969) and 1970s (Barnes et al., 1975) on sediment pore water samples, which exhibited large gradients with depth. The first direct flux measurements on sediment cores were done by Seitzinger et al. (1980) using a technique involving the purging of N2 with helium, followed by measurements of new N2 evolved. The introduction of the relatively simple membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) technique (Kana et al., 1994) coupled to lowcost MS detectors led to growing interest in the development of both core incubation techniques (Kana et al., 1998; Cornwell et al., 1999) and open system measurements (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a; McCutchan et al,. 2003) for quantifying N2 production based on changes in N2:Ar ratios.

Acetylene (C2H2 ) Inhibition

The C2H2 inhibition method 1s a simple and widely used technique for measunng denitrification rates in aquatic and terrestrial sediments based on the inhibition of the transformation ofN20 to N2 (S0rensen, 1978; Bernot et al., 2003; Groffman et al., 2006). N20 , which becomes the terminal product of denitrification, is easily measured due to low atmospheric concentrations and the ease with which it can be measured using gas chromatography coupled with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) (Cornwell et al., 1999; Groffman et al., 2006). The total N20 flux is equivalent to the denitrification rate. However, major limitations of this

12

technique include the incomplete blockage of the N20 transformation to N 2, the concurrent inhibition of nitrification which may result in underestimation of coupled nitrificationdenitrification rates (Seitzinger et al., 1993; Cornwell et al., 1999; Bernot et al., 2003; Groffman et al., 2006), and penetration of acetylene into undisturbed sediments, usually alleviated by performing slurry incubations. Modifications of the technique, using parallel incubations in which nitrification is specifically inhibited have improved the technique (Bernat et al., 2003), however acetylene block is still best used as a measure of denitrification potential rather than actual rates.

N Stable Isotope Tracer Experiments
The nitrogen isotope pairing technique was developed by Nielsen (1992) to measure

denitrification in sediments. Nitrogen has two stable isotopic forms,

14

N and 15N, that denitrifying

bacteria can use indiscriminately. In the method developed by Nielsen, water overlying sediments in the experimental system is enriched with takes place and is solely supported by the that evolves will be of the form

N0 3- (Nielsen, 1992). If denitrification

N0 3- introduced to the overlying water, then the N 2

N 15N (Nielsen, 1992; Rysgaard et al., 1993). However, if the

denitrification that takes place is also supported by internal nitrification processes, then the N2 that evolves will be of the fractionated form and

ct 4N03- from the naturally occurring N03) ct 4N 14N and

N 14N (Nielsen, 1992; Rysgaard et al., 1993). The formation of single-labeled

N 15N) and double-labeled ( 14N 15N) N 2 by denitrification is measured by mass spectrometry and
14

the

N: 15N is indicative of the N0 3- source(s) supporting denitrification (Nielsen, 1992;

Rysgaard et al., 1993). Although this method has the highest precision it can be costly and

13

difficult to interpret due to isotopic fractionation by co-occurring nitrogen cycling processes (Groffman et al., 2006).

Nitrogen Mass Balance The mass balance approach is a comprehensive method based on the conservation of mass principle (National Research Council, 1978). When creating a mass balance budget, the identity and magnitude of all the inputs, outputs, and reservoirs of an element or compound in a defined, bounded area are accounted for in order to study the behaviour of the substance in the system (Boyer et al., 2006). Mass balance models provide insight into interactions between components of the study system (Boyer et al., 2006), the fate of nutrients as they are transported (Boynton et al., 1985), and data needs or gaps (National Research Council, 1978). Major limitations of this method are that a relatively constant stoichiometry of organic matter is assumed based on the Redfield ratio (Groffman et al., 2006) and a complete nitrogen budget of the system in question is required (e.g. Smith et al., 2008). The assumption of constant stoichiometry is not as robust in freshwater systems where phytoplankton have been shown to be less constrained in their elemental ratios than marine phytoplankton (e.g. Reeky et al., 1993; Elser and Hamilton, 2007). The need for a complete nitrogen budget is a minor issue when dealing with core samples, however, when scaling up to the whole system, the issue becomes time, labour and cost intensive as knowledge of various factors are required (e.g. nutrient pool size for each species of nitrogen, hydrology, tributaries, etc.). In addition, uncertainties associated with a large number of variables (e.g. pool sizes of all N-forms and flows of material) are additive (Smith et al., 2008), leading to large uncertainties in the estimates ofN-loss.

14

Membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) Kana et al. (1994) described a method for measuring denitrification rates that involves measuring N2 concentrations in water samples by membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS). This technique is suitable for estimates of ambient denitrification rates, given its relatively rapid set-up and incubation time, and speed of measurement (Cornwell et al., 1999). This method has several advantages over other methods, including rapid throughput (--20 to 30 samples per hour), lack of sample water preparation (i.e. no degassing step), small sample size (:S15 ml), and precise measurement of concentration and gas isotope ratio data (coefficient of variation <0.03% for N2:Ar ratios) (Kana et al., 1994; Kana et al., 1998). However, the method only provides the net change of N2 not information pertaining to the responsible processes; the method does not discriminate between denitrification and anammox, and nitrogen fixation occurring

simultaneously could lead to an underestimate of denitrification. The method also relies on the assumption that Ar is at equilibrium and measurements are dependent on knowledge of gas exchange within the system (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a).

Summary of Techniques There is no single perfect method for measuring denitrification that is best applied to all scenarios (Seitzinger et al., 1993; Pifia-Ochoa and Alvarez-Cobelas, 2006). Stable isotope pairing is best suited for core incubations or very small open systems due to the costs associated with this method (e.g. Bohlke et al., 2004). Acetylene inhibition may be a reasonable approach in highly reducing environments where potential for nitrification is negligible (e.g. S0rensen, 1978). Nitrogen mass balance provides a more complete picture then other methods but can often be time, labour and cost intensive due to the complexity of accounting for all the necessary

15

variables (e.g. Nixon et al., 1995) and propagation of error leads to very imprecise estimates. Membrane inlet mass spectrometry (or isotope ratio mass spectrometry) probably supplants GCbased approaches as they alleviate the need to first strip N 2 (and the many problems associated with this), and offers much greater precision. MIMS based approaches are most applicable to large systems (as opposed to isotope pairing) and offer advantages over whole-system mass balance approaches for the reasons mentioned in section 1.2.1.3. For this reason, this study aims to develop a lentic whole-system modeling approach based on high precision measurements of N 2 :Ar, so that estimates of denitrification based on changes in N 2 :Ar anomalies through time can be made.

1.3

Global Warming
Reactive N in the form N 2 0 contributes to global climate change (Wang et al., 1976;

Huttunen et al., 2003a). Nitrogen oxides can also have impacts on human and ecosystem health (Cowling et al., 1998; Wolfe and Patz, 2002; Galloway et al., 2003). A great deal of attention has been directed to the intermediate gaseous products of denitrification, NO and N 2 0, because of their importance in processes of ozone production and consumption, and radiative forcing (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (I, P CC) employs two metrics for quantitative comparison of the potential impact of different climate change agents (IPCC, 2001 ). The first is radiative forcing (RF), which gives the change in radiative budget (in wm2 )

of the surface-troposphere system following a perturbation by a

climate change mechanism (Fuglestvedt et al., 2003). The other is the Global Warming Potential (GWP), which is defined as the warming influence of a gas over a set time period relative to that of carbon dioxide related to infrared absorption and atmospheric lifetime (IPCC, 2001 ). Increases

16

in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the atmosphere have resulted in the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the midtwentieth century (IPCC, 2001). This is known as global warming.

Freshwaters are important sources of the GHGs nitrous oxide (N20), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (C02). Nitrous oxide is mainly produced during denitrification as an intermediate of the reduction of nitrate (N03 -) to molecular nitrogen (N2). Some N 20 is also formed though nitrification by the oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrite (N02-) (Bremner and Blackmer, 1978).

Increased nitrogen loading leads to an increase in denitrification and subsequently, an increase in nitrous oxide at a rate of 0.20.3% per year (IPCC, 2001; Beaulieu et al., 2008). Globally, denitrification is estimated to produce 6.3 Tg ofN20 in soils and 4.7 Tg N20 in oceans each year, causing the release

of this gas into the atmosphere (Figure 1.5) (IPCC, 2001). Agricultural soil management is estimated to produce the same amount of nitrous oxide. Direct emissions of N 20 from agricultural soils and animal feedlots are fairly well studied but less is known about the indirect emissions of N 20 from groundwater, streams, lakes and rivers receiving N-rich drainage water from agricultural soils (Beaulieu, 2008). Seitzinger & Kroeze (1998) modeled N 20 emissions

17

from rivers and concluded that flowing water in lotic systems are responsible for 20% of global anthropogenic N20 emissions.

Rivers have been included in recent global estimates of the aquatic N20 emissions (e.g. Seitzinger and Kroeze, 1998; Seitzinger et al., 2000), but lakes are not considered significant sources of N20 emissions and are often excluded (Mengis et al., 1997; Seitzinger and Kroeze, 1998; Huttunen et al., 2003a; Wang et al., 2009). The dismissal of lakes in N20 emission studies creates uncertainty in regional and global estimates as well as modeling results (Seitzinger and Kroeze 1998; Seitzinger et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2009). It is also incongruous with the understanding that the geomorphic properties of lakes make them efficient systems for N removal by denitrification, the primary source of N20 (Harrison et al., 2009). Justification for observing lakes for N20 production is also evident when looking at Arctic lakes with permanent ice cover which have been shown to contain extremely high concentrations of dissolved N20 (Priscu et al., 1996; Priscu et al., 2008). Priscu et al. (2008) reported a N20 concentration of 43.3
~mol N.L- 1 (>700,000% saturation with respect to air) for Lake Bonney (McMurdo Dry Valleys,

Antarctica) which represents one of the highest concentrations for a natural aquatic system.

N20 is a relatively stable GHG that may play a significant role in atmospheric photochemical reactions that contribute to stratospheric ozone destruction (Crutzen, 1970; Hahn and Crutzen, 1982), although the evidence for this remains unclear. Net N20 emissions are variable in space and time, and uncertainty in field-scale budgets is large, especially when fluxes are measured using chambers (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2007). Nitrous oxide, although not released in nearly the same volume and with one tenth the radiative forcing as the more infamous carbon

18

dioxide (IPCC, 2007), has a far greater global warming potential so it takes far less nitrous oxide to produce the same warming effects as carbon dioxide (Table 1.1) (IPCC, 2001; Fuglestvedt et al., 2003; Galloway et al., 2008).

Table 1.1. Atmospheric lifetime, GWPs and RFs of various greenhouse gases (modified from IPCC, 2001).

1.4

Modeling
Approaches to modeling denitrification vary widely from mass balance, to stoichiometry

and regression analysis but uncertainty remains in all estimations of denitrification rates (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006). Uncertainty in denitrification models stems from the fact that small areas ("hotspots") and brief periods ("hot times") frequently account for a high percentage of the denitrification activity that occurs in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006; Groffman et al., 2009b ). Denitrification measurements made at small spatial and temporal scales, and in laboratory conditions are not suitable for scale up to ecosystem levels

19

and provide poor quantitative understanding of in situ rates (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006). A whole system approach integrates over large temporal and spatial scales to minimize the uncertainty brought about by the phenomena of "hotspots" and "hot times" (Cornwell et al., 1999). To preserve ecological relevance, denitrification measurements should be made within the context of other biological, chemical, and physical processes within the ecosystem being studied (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006). An approach based on understanding the response of denitrification to changing temperature, salinity, overlying water N03-, organic loading, and other limiting factors would have more predictive power than a denitrification measurement program alone (Cornwell et al., 1999).

1.4.1

Open Channel N 2 Method

Previous approaches to measuring denitrification in aquatic systems (i.e. N 2 production and gas-tight chambers) were adapted for in situ denitrification measurements using benthic chambers (e.g., Devol, 1991; Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002b). However, the use of benthic chambers has several limitations. The first is that physical and chemical gradients may be altered which in tum can influence rates of benthic processes such as denitrification (Jahnke et al., 2000). The second limitation of benthic chambers is the uncertainty associated with scaling up from a small surface area (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a). Stable N isotope tracers and mass balance approaches also have their limitations thus a new method was developed to allow for a more direct measurement of in situ denitrification in rivers (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a; McCutchan et al., 2003) through the use ofMIMS (Kana et al., 1994).

20

The open-channel N2 method provides integrated, whole-system estimates of denitrification in flowing waters based on the net production of N2, and corrects for atmospheric exchange (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a). Laursen and Seitzinger (2002a and 2004) used a two-station approach wherein a single parcel of water was followed and sampled through time. This provides spatial representation of denitrification rates (Baulch et al., In Press). McCutchan et al. (2003) used a one station, or diel approach employing a time for space substitution. In that model, temporal patterns of concentration and solubility at an unsampled upstream location are assumed to be the same as those measured in the same parcel of water as it passes through the downstream sampling station (McCutchan et al., 2003).

The open-channel N2 method also provides a direct measure of denitrification via its endproduct N2. The advantages of this method are that it measures denitrification at ecological scales that are spatially (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a; McCutchan et al., 2003) and temporally (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a) relevant, it can be adapted to estimate the in situ production of other biogenic gases simultaneously (e.g. N20 and CH4) (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2004), it is a relatively simple and inexpensive method, and it is applicable to rivers of various sizes. However, open channel methods for measuring N2 production in rivers (Laursen & Seitzinger, 2002a; McCutchan et al. , 2003) do not discriminate between denitrification and anammox. The assumption is that the total N2 production in rivers is due primarily to denitrification (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2004) since anammox is considered of limited importance in estuarine and freshwater systems (Schubert et al., 2006). Open channel methods also do not discriminate between denitrification and nitrogen fixation thus denitrification may be underestimated in systems where rates ofN-fixation are high, and are not amendable for use in cascading mountain

21

streams (McCutchan et al., 2003) where gas re-equilibration rates are high and entrainment ofN2 is high (gas bubbles become injected and collapse resulting in abnormally high N2 concentrations). The greatest limitation of the open-channel method deals with method uncertainty as discussed by Baulch et al. (In Press).

1.4.2

Model Development- Len tic Systems

The original riverine model (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a) was developed to address the shortfalls of traditional methods used to study biogeochemical processes in rivers. The advantages a model-based whole-system approach has over traditional methods include temporal relevance, spatial relevance (the whole system is analyzed versus the very limited surface area of the chambers or the cores), a reduction in field sampling time (i.e. no need for installation of instrumentation, minimal preparation time), a reduction in the cost associated and the supplies needed, no sampling artefacts introduced by installing chambers (e.g. changes in hydrology), and minimal training required to use of low-tech equipment.

However, modifying the original model to lentic systems presented challenges of its own as new considerations had to be factored in. The reactants and products of many biogeochemical processes (such as denitrification) are gases and in open systems, these gases re-equilibrate with the atmosphere. The original model estimated re-equilibration on the basis of a piston velocity and the disequilibrium of dissolved gases in water, with equilibrium dissolved gas concentrations being estimated from water temperature and salinity (Weiss et al., 1970). However, the equilibrium also depends on the partial pressure of the gas in the atmosphere, and therefore on

22

air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity, all of which change rapidly. In the work described in this thesis, the model is modified to include these important parameters.

1.4.2.1

Model Inputs

The original model had the following measured inputs: channel depth, channel width, channel velocity,
~

time (time between measurements), initial N 2 concentration, initial

equilibrium N 2, water temperature, the first order exchange rate (KN2), and denitrification rate (Figure 1.6). The derived inputs included: channel volume, sediment surface area, water surface area, and [d( equilibrium N2)]/dt (Figure 1.6) (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a).

The calculated N 2 concentrations are a function of the previous N2 concentration plus the amount of new N2 produced (equal to the denitrification rate times the sediment surface area), minus the N 2 lost due to re-equilibration. Denitrification rates are estimated by modifying the denitrification rate (as a model input) such that the model predicted final in situ N2 concentration matches the measured final in situ N 2 concentration (Figure 1.7). N2 flux is area-specific rate of

23

N 2 lost to the atmosphere and is a function of the depth of the system (h) and the first order exchange rate (kN2) multiplied by the previous N 2 concentration, minus the N2 equilibrium concentration for the time step in question.

Sampling

Lagrangian sampling, wherein the properties of a single marked particle are sampled over a period Lambda, was used for the measurement of N 2 flux rates in the original whole-system approach developed by Laursen and Seitzinger (2002a). Figure 1.8 shows how a parcel of water was measured. The first step is to repeatedly measure the same parcel of water as it moves downstream over time. This is done in order to measure the change in the concentration of nitrogen as a N2:Ar ratio within that parcel of water. The second step is to determine how quickly N2 goes back into the atmosphere by using volatile tracers to determine first order gas exchange rates. The third step is to use the model-based approach (figures 1.6 and 1.7) to solve for denitrification rate based on gas exchange rate, changes in N 2 concentration during riverine transport, and physical characteristics of the system (such as width and depth).

Model Modification

The modified model used for this research project included the following measured parameters which affect the partial pressure and gas exchange rate of a gas [see explanation below]: air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind velocity, and Schmidt number coefficient (Figure 1.9). Channel depth, width and velocity will be replaced with lake depth, while denitrification becomes a model output. Several inputs to the model are held constant including: initial N2 concentration, final N2 concentration, time interval, and water column depth. Other inputs to the model were variable over the measurement interval and these included: water temperature, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind velocity, and the Schmidt number. The model is then run repeatedly, with a new value of each variable input selected with each iteration. The selection of values for a variable model input was based on the distribution of measured values for that variable over the sampling interval.

The concentration of a dissolved gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas (Henry's Law) (Mackay and Shiu, 1981). Partial pressure is reported with respect to dry air; however pressure is dependant on moisture content which is a function of temperature and relative humidity (Equation 1.1 ).

e is the constant Euler's number, and T is the

temperature of the moist air in degrees K. Relative humidity is inversely proportional to pressure and temperature (which is directly proportional to the saturation vapour pressure). Water temperature also affects gas saturation levels and gas exchange rates (Weiss, 1970). The solubility of a gas is inversely proportional to temperature because increasing temperature results

26

in increased kinetic energy of the gas molecules causing bonds to break and gas molecules to escape.

Gas flux across the air-water interface is determined by molecular transfer across a diffusive layer of thickness 11z. Turbulence in the form of wind reduces tJ.z which in turn increases the transfer velocity, k (Liss and Slater, 1974; Wanninkhof, 1992). Gas flux can be estimated indirectly with equation 1.2:

F = k(Cw- aCa)

Equation 1.2

Where k is the gas transfer velocity, Cw and Ca are the gas concentrations in water and air, respectively, near the interface, and a is the Ostwald solubility coefficient. The piston velocity (k) is a function of turbulence at the interface, the momentum diffusivity of the water (v), and the diffusion coefficient or mass diffusivity of the gas (D). The ratio of v and D is referred to as the Schmidt number (Sc

= v/D)

which varies for a gas as a function of temperature. For a smooth

liquid interface, k is proportional to Sc-213 (Deacon, 1977) and for an interface with waves, k is proportional to Sc- 112 (Ledwell, 1984). Thus wind speed and Schmidt number are important variable additions as they directly affect gas exchange rates (Wanninkhof, 1992; Laursen and Seitzinger, 2005).

Lentic systems present different sampling considerations than rivers in that one is now dealing with a more static body of water that is not typically well mixed, and which is often thermally stratified. Therefore, assumptions made in the riverine model of a well-mixed parcel of water moving downstream a predictable distance over a given time do not apply to lakes. When

27

applying the whole-system approach to lakes, instead of sampling one parcel of water repeatedly over a period of time, many parcels of water are sampled (depth defined strata) throughout the water column.

When the area between the measured and equilibrium concentrations is integrated, it represents an inventory of surplus gas (disequilibrium) at a single point in time. The change in this inventory over time can be used to determine a rate of change in the inventory. By simultaneously estimating flux to the atmosphere, a production rate of the gas can be estimated. In this example, the inventory of excess N20 is shown by the shaded area. The model is then used to determine the rate of production necessary to explain the surplus of N20 given the rate of atmospheric

28

exchange from the top stratum. Alternatively, the model can determine the rate of gas production that would be needed to generate the observed surplus if the surplus were to represent a steadystate.

1.4.3.1

Stratification

Special considerations had to be made when modifying the original model from a !otic system to a lentic system and this included accounting for stratification. Stratification is generally produced by gradients in temperature and/or salinity. Stratification caused by temperature gradation is due to solar heating of surface waters which causes the warmer, less dense surface water to sit on top of colder water, with a thermocline in between (Hutchinson, 1938; Fee et al., 1996; Wetzel, 2001; Kim, 2006). Stratification is greatest in the summer when the surface waters are exposed to the greatest amount of warming. Wind is the primary means of mixing the different layers but as the thermocline increases greater energy is required to cause mixing. As a consequence, very little mixing of warm water and cold water occurs. This results in the epilimnion (the surface layer) and hypolimnion (the bottom, cooler layer) exhibiting different physiochemical characteristics (Hutchinson, 1938; Kim, 2006). During fall and as winter approaches, the surface waters will cool and eventually become denser then the deeper waters which causes the two layers to overturn and mixing to occur. Stratification is minimal during the winter as there are minute temperature gradients (Wetzel, 2001; Kim, 2006). If air temperature continues to drop, ice formation will occur. The process is repeated in the springtime with the warming of the ice-cover which produces dense water that then sinks below causing mixing to occur. This seasonal stratification can cause "hotspots" and "hot times" resulting in a greater need for a more robust model to handle the heterogeneity of the system examined.

1.4.3.2

Monte Carlo Analysis

A statistical model was developed for the estimation of denitrification rates, metabolic rates and N 2 0 flux rates by applying a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to field observations to create probability distributions given different climate variables. With deterministic modeling, which was applied in the original model, single-point estimates are chosen from field observations to produce a few, discrete estimations. Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling of probability distribution functions as model inputs (here water temperature, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind velocity, and the Schmidt number) to produce hundreds or thousands of possible outcomes based on probability that account for the full range of field observations (Tonitto et al., 2009). Since estimations of denitrification rates, metabolic rates and N 2 0 production rates are based on model inputs that vary over a broad range across spatial and temporal scales, this modeling approach is an empirical tool for approximating the response to diverse environmental conditions (Tonitto et al., 2009). A recent review of wholesystem measurements of denitrification in rivers has pointed out the need for Monte Carlo analysis in these models to better constrain error estimates associated with model output (Baulch et al, In Press). Monte Carlo analysis has been added as a component of the model developed here when modifying riverine models for lentic application.

1.5

Rationale
The rationale behind this research project is the development of a new approach for the

measurement of denitrification at the whole-lake scale that is ecologically relevant at spatial and temporal scales with better estimation and constraint of error. The proposed method would also be advantageous in that prohibitive factors such as cost, level of expertise, time consumption,

30

and propagation of error due to scaling up found in other methods would be reduced. This would allow a research program to determine denitrification (and, simultaneously other biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas production) in a larger number of lakes than would be possible using more traditional approaches. As a result, a research team can begin addressing more significant ecological questions regarding physical, chemical, and biological drivers of denitrification at the whole-system to watershed scale

1.5.1

Objectives

The present study had four objectives involved with this research project. The first was the modification of an existing whole-system model that was developed by Laursen and Seitzinger (2002a) for application in lentic systems. Climate parameters such as wind velocity, water depth, water and air temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure, were included in the model calculations to improve estimates of gas re-equilibration over those made in the 2002 model. The flux rates and/or concentrations of dissolved N 2 , 0 2 , and N2 0 were determined. The second objective was field validation of the modified whole-system model by comparing results obtained with the enclosure method of chamber use to the in situ approach. It was hypothesized that the new method would provide a faster, simpler and more robust method for measuring denitrification and other biogeochemical processes at ecologically relevant temporal and spatial scales, but if there was not correspondence between the rates measured in whole-system versus benthic chamber approaches, the open system approach may need further modification before it can be adopted.

31

The third objective was the development of an annual budget of N 20 production within a single aquatic system. This was achieved by performing a high frequency of measurements for a period of one year. It was hypothesized that frequent and continuous sampling would provide a more complete and accurate budget because both variability and trends due to seasonal, climate and ice-cover changes would be recorded and accounted for, providing a greater understanding of the components that affect biogeochemical cycling on temporally and spatially relevant scales.

The fourth objective was the development and use of a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm within the model to better constrain error in model estimates of denitrification, whole-system metabolism, and greenhouse gas production. It was hypothesized that the use of probability distributions to generate rate loss or gain estimates would result in the decrease of uncertainty of model predictions because the full range of field observations and the distributions of these observations, instead of discrete observations used in deterministic models, would be used to determine a range of estimates that reflect changing environmental conditions.

1.5.2

Contributions to Science

A new and robust tool will be developed that allows for the examination of biogeochemical processes at ecologically significant temporal and spatial scales. It will emphasize the need to better constrain error and nutrient budget estimations through the use of Monte Carlo analysis, and will improve on previous models by better modeling gas re-equilibration by inclusion of additional atmospheric data.

32

The major implications of this research project will be the application of this tool to allow for cross-system comparison and the application of this for the measurement of other biogeochemical processes.

CHAPTER2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection was performed at Christie Lake (Conservation Hamilton, Dundas, ON, Canada) and Turtle Pond (Stoney Creek, ON, Canada). Experiments were conducted in the environmental laboratories of Drs. Andrew Laursen, Lynda McCarthy, and Vadim Bostan (Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada), the Ryerson University Analytical Centre (Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada), and the laboratory belonging to Dr. Roxane Maranger (Universite de Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada).

Site Description 2.1.1 Christie Lake

Christie Lake (Figure 2.1) is a reservoir that is part of Conservation Hamilton property located in Dundas, ON, Canada (latitude: 43 .2878 N and longitude: 80.0278 W) with an average depth of ~3.5m and a surface area of ~10 ha. The site was chosen in consultation with Conservation

Hamilton and Conservation Halton. The ideal study site was a lake that had substantial depth and would reliably stratify and after consultation, this was believed to be the deepest and most relatively stable body of water under Conservation Authority jurisdiction. However, the study site was much shallower than estimated, and with a wet year and high flow through, it did not stratify well. Sampling occurred in June, July and October, 2008. The sampling dates were June 21-22, July 24-25, and October 3-4, of 2008. Reservoirs are artificial lakes created to hold water for various uses ranging from recreational to flood control. These 'lakes' undergo a good deal of

34

mixing and cycling between oxic and anoxic conditions due to the removal and re-introduction of the water from these systems. This property of the system made it a good choice for method validation as "hotspots" and "hot times" are endemic to this system.

factor that determines the nature of the soil (hydric soil) and the types of plant and animal communities living in or on the surface of the soil (EPA, 1995). They cover a large range of differing climatic and geographic regions across the biosphere and are regions of great biodiversity (EPA, 1995). Sampling in Turtle Pond occurred on a weekly or bi-weekly interval during a period from November, 2007 to September, 2008 with an interruption from March to August of2008. The sampling dates were as follows: November 2, 11, 18 and 28, 2007; January 10, 26, February 3, 16, 23, March 2, August 11, 18, 28, September 4, 12,20 and 28, 2008.

2.2

Sample Collection 2.2.1 Christie Lake

2.2.1.1

Water Column Sampling

A Niskin-type sampler was used to collect discrete water samples at 0.5m intervals ranging from 0.5m below the water surface to 3.5m below the water surface (Figure 2.3). The Niskin-

35

type sampler was made of a Plexiglas cylinder that was closed at each end by a rubber force cups connected by rubber tubing. The two cups were placed in the armed position by short loops of wire and released underwater by a messenger sent down a length of rope that had depth measurements on it. The sampler was then pulled up and water samples retrieved immediately to minimize exposure to the atmosphere. Sample containers were gently overFigure 2.3. Grab sampling method.

filled by gravity with a tube inserted into the bottom of the vessel delivering a minimum of 3x the vessel volume. Water samples for N 2 and 0 2 analysis were placed in gas-tight 5mL Exetainers (Labco International Inc., Houston, TX, U.S.A.) and preserved with a small volume of ZnCh at a final concentration of 0.1% vol/vol. The samples were sealed immediately and preserved in a way so as not to change pH which can change the solubility of C02 in tum changing the partial pressure of the gases.

Nutrient samples were filtered using a Whatman GF/F filter (nominal pore size= 0.7Jlm), placed in 50mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes, and stored in a cooler filled with ice while in the field. Samples were then transferred to a freezer within 8 hours of sampling and stored at -20°C until analysis. Samples for N 20 analysis were prepared by injecting 1OmL of water collected into 30mL serum vials that had been previously flushed with nitrogen gas (purging with N 2 for 10 volumes of the vessel). The samples were allowed to re-equilibrate and 5mL of the headspace was withdrawn and injected into gas-tight 5mL Exetainers that had previously been flushed with N2 as above. Sample vessels for all gases were stored immersed in water at a temperature,...., 1oc 36

below in situ temperature. If the samples were stored at a temperature higher then the in situ temperature, degassing and formation of a gas bubble in the sample could have resulted. The samples were also stored under water so that if the volume of the sample changed and a vacuum was created, water would have been sucked in versus air. Sample collection is the most important step because it is where there is the most potential for error to occur. The most important thing to consider is the entrainment of air bubbles which is not desired. The presence of an air headspace or formation of a pocket due to degassing can result in the stripping of nitrogen preferentially over Ar, resulting in a decrease in N2 :Ar in water during storage.

2.2.1.2

Benthic Sampling

Figure 2.4. Benthic chambers used for enclosure sampling.

Samples were collected using benthic chambers at the sediment-water interface (Fig. 2.4). The chambers were manufactured from acrylic, were round in shape with a flat top and an open bottom, and had a volume of 39L, with a surface area of 0.196m
2 .

The chambers contained a

propeller for mixing, and a sampling port connected to tubing to facilitate sample withdrawal. The chambers were deployed using SCUBA and sediment resuspended during installation was allowed to settle for a minimum of two hours before sample collection commenced. A transect line was placed with the chambers to aid in placement and locating the chambers in times of poor

37

water clarity. For sample withdrawal, 25mL gas-tight glass syringes were attached to the chambers via tubing. Mixing of water inside the chamber with the water entering the chamber inlet was prevented through the use of a nitrile bag that was fastened to the inlet port within the chamber. The nitrile bag is used to prevent pressure changes and formation of headspace in the chamber (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002b ). As water was removed from the sampling port, the corresponding volume was replaced by water flowing into the inlet and filling the nitrile bag.

Immediately after surfacing, the water samples were transferred to the appropriate vessels for storage and analysis at a later date. Samples for N2 :Ar were transferred to Exetainers using a short piece ofTygon tubing (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, Akron, OH, U.S.A.) inserted to the bottom of the vessel. The plunger was depressed very slowly to prevent an increase in pressure inside the tube and the consequent increase in solubility of N 2· Sample storage was the same as that for water column sampling: nutrient samples were filtered then frozen; water samples for N 2 and 0 2 analysis were preserved then stored in water,..., 1oc below the in situ temperature; and samples for N 2 0 analysis were prepared by injection of water into N 2 flushed serum vials and collection of the headspace (please refer to section 2.2.1 .1 for greater detail). Climate data was obtained from Environment Canada's historical weather data for the weather station located at Hamilton International Airport (Climate Data Online

http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climateData/canada e.html).

2.2.2

Turtle Pond

A Niskin-type sampler was used to collect discreet water samples near the surface ("'0.2m depth) and a meter below the surface of the water. Sample collection and storage were as

38

previously described in sections 2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.2. Climate data was obtained from a weather station (WS-1610U-IT-11, La Crosse Technology Ltd., La Crosse, WI, U.S.A.) that remained on-site through out the sampling periods. During periods of ice cover an auger was used to bore a hole through the ice and samples were collected by deploying the sampler through the hole. Disruptions in sampling (from late November to early January) were due to unsafe ice conditions.

2.3

Samples Analyses 2.3.1 Nitrogen and Oxygen gas- MIMS

Dissolved N2 and 02 concentrations were determined using a modified version of the MIMS method developed by Kana et al. (1994). A stainless steel capillary draws up the water sample into a semi-permeable membrane that is placed in glass tubing under high vacuum. Gaseous molecules are stripped from the water and swept towards the mass spectrometer for ionization and detection at m/z values of 28, 32, and 40 for N2, 0 2 and Ar respectively. N2 and 0 2 concentrations were not directly measured but were calculated from N2:Ar and 02:Ar concentrations since it has been found that N2:Ar measurements have smaller errors associated with them (<0.03% coefficient of variation) than N2 measurements alone (<0.10% coefficient of variation) (Kana et al., 1994). Instrument calibration was performed with deionized water standards that were atmospherically equilibrated, with known salinity and temperature (Kana et al., 1994). The standards were maintained at a constant temperature of 18.0°C in the same thermostated bath that contained the membrane apparatus and stirred slowly to prevent entrainment of bubbles (Kana et al., 2006). Dissolved gas concentrations were determined from

39

equations derived by Weiss (1970) and the instrument signal was adjusted to match the calculated values (Kana et al., 1994; Kana et al., 2006).

2.3.2

Nitrous Oxide- GC-ECD

N20 concentrations were measured by gas chromatography coupled with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) (AutoSystem XL, PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) with a Plot 1010 column (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, U.S.A.) after dissolved gases were allowed to equilibrate with the N2 headspace. The ECD uses a radioactive Beta emitter (electrons) to ionize some of the carrier gas and produce a current between a biased pair of electrodes. When organic molecules with electronegative functional groups (i.e. nitro groups) pass by the detector, they capture some of the electrons and reduce the current measured between the electrodes. The temperature settings were 375°C for the ECD, 35°C isothermal for the oven, and 185°C for the injector. The injection volume was 1.00mL, two injections were done for each sample with an average of the results taken, and a standard gas was analyzed after every 10 samples. Injections were performed with a split ratio of 0 and the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. N2 0 flux was calculated from the linear change of its concentration in the chamber volume as a function of time and was expressed in units of nmol N.m-2.h- 1.

2.3.3

Nitrate - Cadmium Reduction Method

Nitrate (plus nitrite) concentrations were determined using a modified version of the cadmium reduction method developed by Wood et al. (1967). In the cadmium reduction method, nitrate is reduced to nitrite in the presence of cadmium granules treated with copper sulfate. A

40

cadmium column was prepared by packing commercially available Cd granules that were made to be copper-coated by treating them with a dilute solution of HCl followed by swirling with CuS0 4 (APHA, 1995). Tubing was attached to both ends of the column, with one end connected to a peristaltic pump and the other end for the collection of the eluted, reduced sample. The peristaltic pump was used for sample withdrawal from the sample vessel into the column. The total nitrite eluted was then reacted with sulfanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride under acidic conditions to form a highly coloured azo dye that has an absorption peak at 543 run. Absorbance was then determined within a 2 hour period using UV-VIS (ultra violet/visible) spectrophotometry (Lambda 20, PerkinElmer Life And Analytical Sciences, Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). The original nitrate concentration was determined with the aid of a standard curve.

All glassware used for nitrate analysis (and the analysis of ammonia and phosphate) was pre-combusted in a muffle furnace at 500°C for 2 hours, washed with 5% HCl prior to use, and then rinsed three times with Millipore-Q water.

2.3.4

Ammonia - Phenate Method

Ammonia concentrations were determined using a modified version of the phenate method developed by Solorzano (1969). In the phenate method, hypochlorite and phenol react with ammonia in the presence of a sodium nitroprusside catalyst to form indophenol. Indophenol is an intensely blue compound that has a strong absorption peak at 640 run. Absorbance of the resulting indophenol was determined within a 24 hour period using UV-VIS spectrophotometry

41

(Lambda 20, PerkinElmer Life And Analytical Sciences, Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). The original ammonia concentration was then determined with the aid of a standard curve.

2.3.5

Phosphate - Ascorbic Acid Method

Phosphate concentrations were determined using a modified version of the ascorbic acid method developed by Murphy and Riley (1962). In the ascorbic acid method, ammonium molybdate and potassium antimonyl tartrate react in an acid medium with orthophosphatephosphorus to form an antimonyl-phospho-molybdate complex that is then reduced to an intensely blue-coloured complex by ascorbic acid. Absorbance of the molybdenum blue complex was determined within a half hour period using UV-VIS spectrophotometry (Lambda 20, PerkinElmer Life And Analytical Sciences, Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). The original phosphate concentration was then determined with the aid of a standard curve.

2.4

Determining Denitrification

For the purposes of this study three approaches were taken to measure denitrification. The first approach employed the use of benthic chambers which has inherent uncertainty due to extrapolation of rates that were determined in meter and hour scales to kilometer and month scales for ecosystem studies of denitrification (McCutchan et al., 2003; Groffman et al., 2006). The second approach was the use of a whole-system approach that used in situ measurements from the water column in combination with MatLab modeling (see section 2.5 for further details). This approach relies heavily on the ability to precisely measure dissolved N2 against a high background concentration while contending with the physical processes of mixing and air exchange (Groffman et al., 2006). Both approaches determined denitrification by measuring N2

42

production through the use of MIMS. The third approach employed stoichiometry based on the Redfield ratio (1 06 C: 15 N: 1 P) (Redfield, 1934). The assumption was made that when organic matter with a known elemental ratio (Redfield) is decomposed using 0 2, there will be a set of products with a defined elemental composition. The consumption of 0 2 was expected to be related -to two processes, respiration (and mineralization of organic N) and nitrification. An assumption was made that all ammonium was oxidized to nitrate. Oxygen consumption was then apportioned between these two processes. The portion of 0 2 consumption ascribed to respiration was estimated to produce 15mol inorganic N for every 100 mol 0 2 consumed, assuming 1mol 02 consumed per 1mol C02 produced. The difference between the expected change in dissolved inorganic N (DIN) concentration change due to remineralization and the observed change in DIN concentration was then used to calculate denitrification as N loss.

2.5

Modeling

The general modeling structure was adapted from Laursen and Seitzinger (2002a, 2005). Denitrification was determined to be the change in the dissolved N2 concentration (DN2) required to achieve the observed change in N2, from time= n to time= n + 1(t =time), given KN2 (K =first-order gas transfer rate). In other words, denitrification was determined by the excess in N2 not accounted for by atmospheric exchange alone. Excess N2 was determined by first modeling the expected change in N2 concentration if no denitrification took place (i.e. due only to re-equilibration with the atmosphere). Denitrification was then calculated based on the N2 production necessary to explain the excess N2 observed in the measured concentration in comparison to the equilibrium concentration. Changes in dissolved N2 were modeled using 1hour time steps, allowing for changes at each time step in KN2 due to variations in water

43

temperature by recalculating the Schmidt number coefficient of N2 (ScN2) and equilibrium N2 concentration. The determination of the net consumption of 0 2 as well as the net production of N 20 followed the same modeling structure.

2.5.1

Modeling Environment

Another modification to the original model is the environment used to generate estimations. A switch was made from the software program Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, W A, U.S .A.) to MatLab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, U.S.A.). The software program MatLab was used to randomly and iteratively sample through Monte Carlo analysis initial N 2 concentration, final N 2 concentration, time interval, and water column depth against the distributions that were calculated for each of the following inputs: water temperature, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind velocity, and the Schmidt number coefficient ranging between ~

and -%. For each of the above input variables, distributions of the same sample size were

generated by creating an alternate matrix of random values with the same distribution frequency as the original input variable. MatLab then read in the values from each variable matrix line by line with each iteration. Normal distribution was confirmed with a K-S Lilliefors test for normality using Systat (Systat Software Inc. , Chicago IL, U.S.A.). The model was run with one hour time steps and 1000 iterations. MatLab generated 1000 unique solutions for denitrification rate based on the values of input variables. Reported denitrification rates are based on the mean ± 95% confidence intervals from this population of 1000 unique solutions. Oxygen consumption and N 20 production were similarly modeled. Different approaches were used to the run the model (see sections 2.5.1.1 and 2.5.1 .2).

44

2.5.1.1

Christie Lake

For Christie Lake, the first method used to run the model was the determination ofDN2 for each stratum of water followed by the summation of the results. This was achieved by entering the measured N2 concentration for the top layer of water (0.5m) at the beginning and end of the specified time period as model inputs for initial and final values of N 2 concentration into MatLab. The remaining strata (represented at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5m below the surface of the water) were treated as though no diffusive loss to the atmosphere occurred. The model generated values for DN2 were then averaged and the mean value summed with the calculated values for DN2 for the remaining strata. The second method used to run the model for Christie Lake was the determination of DN2 when treating the lake as one parcel of water. This was achieved by averaging the N2 concentrations over the depth profile (e.g. measured values for N2 obtained at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5m below the surface of the water) for the specified time period. The average values (for water column N2 on June 21-22 and July 24-25) were then entered into MatLab as model inputs for initial and final values ofN2, respectively, to produce DN2.

The third method used for Christie Lake was based on the assumption of a pseudo steady state. In this approach, values of dissolved N2 were assumed to have reached a steady state between production and loss to the atmosphere. Therefore, the values measured for N2 were entered as both the initial and final concentrations in a model with a one week run. This form of the model was run both as discrete parcels (approach 1) and with the column treated as a single parcel (approach 2).

45

2.5.1.2

Turtle Pond

The method used to run the model for Turtle Pond was the determination of DN2 by entering the measured N2 concentration at the beginning and end of a specified time period as model inputs for initial and final values of N2 concentration into MatLab. Turtle Pond was not modeled by stratum as it was well mixed (based on measured chemical parameters near the surface and the bottom).

2.5.2

Model Inputs

The original model had the following measured inputs: channel depth, channel width, channel velocity,
~time,

initial N2 concentration, initial equilibrium N2, water temperature and

KN2, and denitrification rate. Derived inputs for the model included: channel volume, sediment

surface area, water surface area, and [d(equilibrium N2)]/dt (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a). The modified model used for this research project added the following measured parameters which affect the partial pressure and gas exchange rate of a gas: air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and wind velocity. Channel depth, width and velocity were replaced with lake depth, while denitrification became a model output. The inputs that remained constant during the model simulation were initial N2 concentration, final N2 concentration, time interval, and water column depth. The inputs that were entered as distributions were: water temperature, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind velocity, and the Schmidt number coefficient.

Equation 2.1

Nitrogen concentration will be calculated using one hour time steps. For each time step, the N 2 concentration was determined as a function of the previous N 2 concentration (at time n) added to amount ofN2 that was produced (at time interval n ton+ 1) and subtracting the N 2 that was lost from the system, the N2 flux (at time interval n to n+ 1). The initial N 2 concentration was measured using MIMS.

The new N 2 produced is assumed to be solely from net denitrification. Nitrogen production is based on denitrification rate (units of mmol N.m-2.h- 1 over 1h) divided by depth (units of m) and further divided by 2. The division by 2 accounts for 2 mmol N denitrified for every 1 mmol of new N 2 created.

The first half of equation B (0.6292 x 2.718282°·0636 AT) calculates the partial pressure of water vapour as a function of air temperature (AT, in °C) at 100% relative humidity. The second half of equation B (RH/100 x 0.6292 x 2.718282°· 0636 AT) calculates partial pressure as a function of air temperature and relative humidity. At 0°C, relative humidity is 0%, B/1 00 = 0 and the partial pressure term is equal to 1. At temperatures > 0°C, relative humidity is
> 0%, B/1 00# 0 and the partial pressure t erm is < 1. Air temperature was recorded at discrete

time steps with the use of a climate data logger or climate data acquired from Environment Canada.

RH =measured relative humidity (units of%) Relative humidity was recorded at discrete time steps with the use of a climate data logger or climate data acquired from Environment Canada. Relative humidity was measured as a function of height (units in em) above the water surface. The relative humidity data logger was

49

placed at 0, 10, 20, 50, and 80 em above the surface of the water. The purpose was to determine if there was a relationship between relative humidity (units in %) and distance from the surface of the water. This was intended to test the assumption that relative humidity approached 100% near the water surface. This is important as many models of gas exchange assume 100% humidity at the air-water interface. As relative humidity affects partial pressure, this assumption affects modeled equilibrium gas concentrations in water. Further, wind velocity was measured to determine if it influenced the relationship between relative humidity and height above the water column. The data generated could be used ultimately to correct for relative humidity at the water surface as a function of relative humidity measured at a given height and wind velocity.

First order exchange rates were calculated from piston velocities. Piston velocities (k600 , Schmidt number of 600) were calculated from an empirical relationship described by Laursen and Seitzinger (2005) (Figure 2.5). Gas specific first order exchange rates were calculated according to equation 2.6.

KN2= (ScN2 /600t I depth K6oo

Equation 2.6

Where . .. K6oo = k6oo/depth (em) n =Schmidt number coefficient (allowed to vary from-~ to-%)

The Schmidt number is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity and is a function of water temperature. Schmidt numbers for specific gases were calculated according to equations in Appendix D.

2.5.4

Sources of Error and Analysis

Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA) is a method based on computational algorithms that estimates a range of outcomes, given a set of variable conditions, to capture parameter variability (Miller, 2006). MCA is frequently used to quantify variability and uncertainty by using probability distributions of defined variables to generate a range of possible output distributions (Miller, 2006). The number of iterations and possible output estimations is defined by the user. The switch to MatLab allowed for a change from a deterministic model to a stochastic model with greater complexity in the computational algorithms required to run the MCA simulations.

51

The necessity for the use of MCA is its function as a tool to better define uncertainty and therefore aid in constraining error (Miller, 2006; Baulch et al., In Press).

Although past research has attempted to constrain the error in reported nutrient cycling rates, the methods used have differed greatly ranging from the assumption that the error was additive to assuming the error was analytical in nature (Baulch et al., In Press). In an encouraging shift, MCA has been used to constrain error (e.g. McCutchan et al., 2003) but the method is only as good as the number of variables considered that are sources of error (Baulch et al., In Press). Method uncertainty results from of errors in measured variables and derived variables that are not understood or accounted for (Baulch et al., In Press). Error associated with air temperature, water temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind velocity due to instrument precision and frequency of measurements was accounted for in the model by entering these variables as distributions of the recorded field values. The variable distributions were then treated with MCA to produce a range of estimates based on the variable conditions. Error due to uncertainty in the Schmidt number coefficient was also accounted for in the model by varying the Schmidt number coefficient from
-~

to -% as a variable distribution. Possible sources of error

for this study that were not accounted for include: (1) Measurement error of dissolved gas concentrations due to limits of instrument precision; (2) Measurement error of depth; and (3) Uncertainty inK, based on piston velocity (Figure 2.5).

Water Column Gas Concentrations

For all sampling periods during the months of June, July and October, there appears to be a body of warmer water at a depth of -1.5m to 2.0m below the surface of the water (Figures 3.5). This lens of warmer water was most likely due to incoming water flowing from the stream as there was no thermocline and little evidence of stratification. This was an unexpected result as the study site was chosen based on consultation to mimic lake conditions. Instead, since it was a wet year, the study site mimicked a poorly mixed river. This increased the difficulties encountered in trying to model this system.

Figure 3.5 Christie Lake dissolved N2 concentrations for June, July and October, 2008

58

Dissolved N2 concentrations were greatest during all months at the bottom of the depth profile, decreasing in the lens of warmer water, then increasing nearer the surface of the water, as anticipated based on water temperature (Figure 3.5). N 2 concentrations were also greater during June and October then for the month of July (Figure 3.5). The data supports the conclusion that dissolved N2 concentrations were related to temperature and closely tracked equilibrium concentrations. In all months, there was a net excess of N2 (greater total dissolved N 2 than anticipated based on temperature) which can be anticipated in a system that is denitrifying.

02 concentrations were greatest during October, followed by June then July (Figure 3.6). For all three months, 0 2 concentration was below saturation, indicative of net respiration in the system. Sources of dissolved oxygen in the aquatic environment include the atmosphere and photosynthesis, which is influenced by plant and algal biomass, light intensity and water temperature. Loss of dissolved oxygen is due to respiration, decay by aerobic bacteria and decomposition of dead and decaying matter in sediments (Atobatele and U gwumba, 2008). Nutrient enrichment stimulates plant and algal growth and often results in a mass influx of particulate organic matter to the sediments. The decomposition of this labile organic matter by aerobic microorganisms leads to a rapid acceleration of oxygen consumption and increased rates ofN remineralization (Cornwell et al., 1999; Atobatele and Ugwumba, 2008).

Figure 3.6 Christie Lake dissolved 0 2 concentrations for June, July and October, 2008

N20 concentrations were recorded for the months of June and July with higher concentrations in July (Figure 3.7). For both months, the net measured concentrations were well above calculated equilibrium concentrations. In June the dissolved N2 0 concentration was greatest near the sediment and decreased toward the surface. This is suggestive of N20 being derived primarily from denitrification in sediments. In July concentrations reached maxima near

60

the surface and at a depth of 2.5m. This suggests a substantial portion of N20 in July may have been derived from nitrification in the water column.

Fi20re 3.15. Christie Lake depth profiles and benthic flux of nitrate for June, July and October, 2008

Nitrate concentrations decreased from the months of June to July to October (Figure 3 .15) which is consistent with nitrogen loss, either by incorporation, or as suggested by the measured and modeled N 2 production rates, with high rates of denitrification. On net, sediments were a source of nitrate in June. Net consumption of nitrate by sediments was seen in July and October.
It is worth noting that nitrate flux was 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than N 2 flux, indicating that

68

denitrification and nitrification were in near balance in Christie Lake sediments throughout this study.

Fi2ure 3.16. Christie Lake depth profiles and benthic flux of ammonia for June, July and October, 2008

Ammonia water column concentrations also decreased from the months of June to July to October (Figure 3.16). Sediments were generally a source of ammonium, likely due to remineralization of deposited organic matter, and helps explain the generally higher concentrations of ammonium near the sediment. However, as indicated by both nitrate and ammonium loss over time, and high measured and modeled rates of denitrification, the sediments were overall a sink for N in this system.

Phosphate water column concentrations followed the same trend, decreasing from June to July to October (Figure 3.17). Benthic chamber measurements showed that sediments were a sink for phosphate throughout the study. The month of July saw the greatest variation within water column measurements, with highest concentrations associated with the warm water lens.

69

This would be consistent with a riverine source of phosphate enriched, warm water flowing through the system at mid-depth.

Fi20re 3.17 Christie Lake depth profiles and benthic flux of phosphate for June, July and October, 2008

The ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus increased from June to October (Figure 3.18). In June and July, the ratio was below the Redfield ratio of N:P
=

15:1 (Figure

3.18). Under these conditions nitrogen is more likely to limit primary production than phosphorus. By October, however, N:P is much greater than 15:1, suggesting a switch to phosphorus limitation. Although the study site was found to have elevated rates of denitrification, ultimately it is most likely the effect of sediments on sequestering P that limits denitrification. The sediments act as a sink for P, thus limiting primary production. As P becomes increasingly limiting with the progression of the season, less organic material from algal biomass is produced resulting in less organic nitrogen deposition to sediments, less remineralization, nitrification, and fmally a decrease in denitrification of this N. N:P has been found to be high in oligotrophic lakes and very low in eutrophic lakes, declining with increasing phosphorus concentrations (Downing and McCauley, 1992). The observed N:P also reflects the source of nutrients in that high ratios (oligotrophic lakes) are due to natural sources of N and P,
70

while low ratios (mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes) are due to anthropogenic inputs of N and p (Downing and McCauley, 1992).

3.18. Christie Lake depth profile of DIN :DIP for June, July and October 2008

Table 3.1 is a summary of the three approaches used to estimate denitrification rates in Christie Lake. The nitrogen balance approach (based on expected N remineralized given the modeled oxygen consumption rate) (represented in yellow) was closer in value to the benthic chamber (represented in blue) approach than were estimates from the N 2 modeling approach (represented in green). All of the N 2 model-based approaches were substantially higher than the chamber-based approach, with the exception of the single-parcel approach integrated over the June-July interval.

71

equilibrium concentration with the following initial N2 concentrations used for the top parcel in model runs: 550, 545, 540, and 535 J..LM. These new initial inputs to the model resulted in denitrification rates of 2839.5, 2288.6, 1775.4, and 1687.8 J..Lmol N.m-2 .h-1. If final measured N2 concentrations for July 24-25 were similarly allowed to approach equilibrium, model estimates of denitrification would further decrease.

Another possible reason N2-based approaches yielded higher estimates is that benthic chambers could severely underestimate denitrification rates. This could result from several causes. First, there is the inherent uncertainty in extrapolation from a small area (the surface area of the chamber) to the ecosystem scale. The occurrence of hot spots and hot times has been introduced as a limitation in extrapolating chamber measurements to whole ecosystems. Similarly, chambers could be deployed in "cold spots" that would underestimate denitrification when rates are extrapolated to whole systems. Second, disturbance of the sediment layer and disruption of redox boundaries upon deployment of the chamber are givens. The installation of a chamber, however delicately performed, will resuspend sediment. This is particularly true with fine grained sediments. While particle size was not measured, Christie Lake has very fine, silty sediments. The disruption of redox gradients can reduce processes such as denitrification that require anoxic conditions. The third, and perhaps most likely reason chamber approaches might underestimate denitrification comes from the entrainment of air bubbles. N2 partitions more rapidly into these bubbles thenAr. This would reduce the rate at which N2 :Ar increases within the water, leading to underestimation of denitrification. The problem with chambers is that it is very hard to get rid of bubbles and even the smallest of bubbles which may be difficult to see can influence N2:Ar-based measurements.

73

As for the nitrogen balance approach, there are two possible explanations for its proximity to the denitrification rate estimates produced with the benthic chamber approach. The first is that 0 2 is a much easier gas to accurately measure changes over time than
N2,

due to the stronger

disequilibrium of 0 2 than N 2 (Figure 3.5 versus Figure 3.6). We are typically measuring larger changes in 0 2 compared with N 2 , so the level of precision needed is much lower. Measurements that require lower precision, or where concentration changes through time are large relative to background concentrations (such as for N2 0 and CH4) are less sensitive to gas partitioning into air bubbles. Therefore, a more robust estimation of 0 2 consumption can be made compared to denitrification. However, more accurate estimations of denitrification rates based on the stoichiometric approach could be made if the elemental ratio of phytoplankton was measured versus assumed. Freshwater phytoplankton have been shown to be less constrained in their

elemental ratios than marine phytoplankton, which maintain the Redfield ratio more consistently (e.g. Reeky et al., 1993), hence there is more potential for error when applying stoichiometric techniques in freshwaters (Groffman et al., 2006).

Another observation based on comparison of approaches is that modeling denitrification by treating the water column as a single parcel, rather than modeling each depth stratum, resulted in closer agreement to benthic chamber measurements (Figure 3 .19). The reason for this is that most of the water column is relatively close to equilibrium. The depth stratum representing the greatest disequilibrium is the surface stratum where the atmospheric exchange occurs. Treating the entire water column as a single parcel uses mean measured N2 and mean equilibrium N2 integrated over the water column. As most depth strata are near equilibrium, this approach reduces the driving influence of the surface layer in stratum by stratum modeling.

74

Seasonal trends The physiochemical properties of aquatic ecosystems change in composition and concentration on a seasonal, diurnal or even hourly basis (Atobatele and Ugwumba, 2008). The spring thaw signals a transitional period for ice-covered water bodies. Physical forcings change dramatically between ice cover and open water, creating large and rapid changes in lake biology and geochemistry (Baehr and DeGrandpre, 2004). As the ice and snow cover diminishes, light penetration stimulates both phytoplankton growth and convective mixing (Baehr and DeGrandpre, 2004). Surface water temperatures continue to warm and causing the surface water to sink, due to a change in water density, or to be mixed by winds to greater depths, which results

in an isothermal water column (Baehr and DeGrandpre, 2004). With further solar heating, the
water column becomes thermally stratified, isolating the bottom water from the atmosphere until turnover occurs again, usually in the fall (Baehr and DeGrandpre, 2004).

Lakes have demonstrated large seasonal variability in denitrification rates with the highest levels occurring during late spring to early summer (Pina-Ochoa and Alvarez-Cobelas, 2006). This seasonal summer maximum may be a result of increased nitrate availability after a springtime peak (Kana et al. 1998; David et al., 2006), increased temperatures due to summer climate (David et al., 2006; Atobatele and Ugwumba, 2008; Groffinan, 2009a; Sobota et al., 2009), and reduced oxygen concentrations (Pina-Ochoa and Alvarez-Cobelas, 2006). For many systems, the dissolved 0 2 concentration decreases with warming water temperatures (Groffman, 2009a; Wang et al., 2009). With a shift in redox potential in the sediments due to decreasing oxygen concentrations, there is an increase in the flux ofNH4+ and PO/- into the overlying water (Rabalais, 2002). Nitrification rates have been shown to increase with increasing temperatures

75

which results in a summer maxima for NH4 concentrations in the water column (Kemp et al. , 1990).

General seasonal trends were observed for denitrification estimates obtained with the benthic chamber approach, the steady state - multiple strata model approach, and the steady state - single parcel model approach (Figure 3.19). Although the general trend in most temperate aquatic systems is for denitrification rates to be greatest during late spring to early summer (e.g. David et al., 2006) the greatest denitrification rates for Christie Lake were observed in midsummer to fall. The reason for this could, in part, be due to the unseasonably cool spring and early summer as well as relatively high early fall water temperatures. It is also worth noting that water column nitrate concentrations were low throughout the study period (Figure 3.15). Denitrification rates might have been higher earlier in the spring, before measurements were performed, if the spring flush resulted in elevated nitrate concentrations.

Assumptions of Relative Humidity

Previous open system models (Cole et al., 1994; Cole and Caraco, 2001; Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a, McCutchan et al. , 2003) have made assumptions about the water saturation level of the air above the surface of the water. The assumption is that relative humidity increases to 100% saturation the closer one gets to surface of the water (or the air-water interface). Therefore the exchange of gasses across the air-water interface is assumed to be from water to air at 100% humidity. This is an important assumption as relative humidity affects partial pressures of gases in air, and therefore, equilibrium concentrations in water when gasses re-equilibrate between water and this moist air mass. The expected distribution of relative humidity, if the 100% saturation assumption is correct, is illustrated in Figure 3.31 a. Relative humidity data generating patterns such as shown in Figure 3.31a can be log transformed (natural log) and fit to a regression, the slope of which is the first-order decay coefficient (K) describing the shape of the curve. The assumption that the air mass is at 100% relative humidity would be supported by an observation that this slope (or K) is negative and non-zero wherever the relative humidity of the air mass measured well above the water column is less than 100%. Further, if shape of this curve (and, therefore, K) could be expected to relate to wind velocity. A high wind velocity would tend to favour a well-mixed air mass above the water with a sharp boundary where relative humidity increases sharply to 100% saturation. In contrast, a low wind velocity would be expected to favour a poorly mixed air mass above the water column and a more gradual transition to 100% relative humidity at the air-water interface (Figure 3.31 b).

Relative humidity measurements were conducted at fixed points above the water surface for two purposes, 1) to determine if the assumption that rH% is 100% at the air-water interface is

90

valid. If it is, water would always equilibrate with an air mass at 100% saturation, and there would be no need to include rH% as a model input. 2) To determine if rH% can be estimated at the air water interface as a function of wind velocity if the assumption of rH% = 100 at the airwater interface is not supported. Results of rH% measurements taken under a wide range of bulk air rH% and wind velocity conditions revealed two important patterns. The first is that K was not related to wind velocity (Figure 3.32). Therefore, rH% at the air-water interface cannot be estimated at the air-water interface based on a bulk air rH% and wind velocity. Second and more importantly, there is little support for K values being negative and significantly different than zero. This suggests that rH% measured in bulk air, such as by placing an rH% probe 1 meter above the water surface, provides a reasonable approximation of rH% at the air-water interface. This rH% measurement is an appropriate model input as the assumption that rH% is 100% at the air-water interface was not supported.

Model Output for Gas Rates

(N2,

0 2, and N20)

In the late autumn, 2007, Turtle Pond alternated between net N 2 0 production and N 2 0 consumption, with rates ranging between -344 nmol N.m-2 .h- 1 during Nov.02-11 and 131 nmol.N m-2.h- 1 during Nov. 11-18 (Appendix H). During most measurement periods, Turtle Pond was a net N 2 0 producer, with production spiking during the late summer - early autumn, 2008 (Figure 3.33a).

Nitrogen and oxygen gas production were only measured during the late summer - Early autumn, 2008 (Appendix H). N2 production during this period was between 10 and 74 J..tmol N.m2

.h- 1 (Figure 3.33b ). Oxygen production was variable with net consumption during the period

August 18- 28 (-3021 J..tmol 0 2 .m-2 .h- 1) and net production during the other sampling intervals

Nutrient Data

Nitrate production was greatest during the summer period from August 11-September 28, 2008 and the lowest during the early winter period of November, 2007 (Figure 3.34a). Ammonium production was greatest in early winter of 2007 and late summer of 2008 with the greatest decline during winter of 2007 (Figure 3.34b). Phosphate production was greatest during the winter of 2007/2008, especially after the period of the first ice-thaw, and the greatest decline was seen at the start of winter in November, 2007 (Figure 3.34c). Generally, sediments were a strong sink for nutrients in late autumn, while tending to be a source (at least for nitrate) in summer and early autumn (Table 3.2).

N:P was greatest September 04-12, 2008 at 164.8 and the least November 28-Janaury 10, 2008 at 20.62 which represents a significant amount of total nitrogen (N0 3 and NH4) in relation to phosphorus (P0 4). Winter of 2007/8 saw the smallest values which represents an increase in the amount of phosphorus relative to total nitrogen. N :P was above the Redfield ration of 15: 1 on all dates (Table 3.2). Generally, nutrient ratios suggest that this system is phosphorus limited during much of the year. Based on this, phosphorus availability is likely to limit the production of organic matter, deposition of this organic matter to sediments, and processing of organic N (including denitrification) in sediments.

CHAPTER4 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1 Summary and Conclusions

This study had four objectives the first of which was the modification of an existing wholesystem model (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002a) for application in lentic systems. This was achieved by utilizing a MatLab environment to integrate new model inputs (air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind velocity). The second objective was field validation of the modified whole-system model by comparing results obtained with denitrification measured in benthic chambers. Field validation was carried out at Christie Lake in Dundas, ON and Turtle Pond in Stoney Creek, ON (Canada). The third objective was the development of an annual budget ofN 2 0 production within a single aquatic system, Turtle Pond. The fourth objective was the development and use of a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm within the model to better constrain error in model estimates of denitrification, whole-system metabolism, and greenhouse gas production.

Three approaches were used to estimate denitrification rates in Christie Lake; the nitrogen balance approach, the benthic chamber approach and the N2 model-based approach. The nitrogen balance approach (20-1,747 J..tmol N.m- 2 .h- 1) was closest in value to the chamber approach (57199 J..tmol N.m- 2 .h- 1) (Table 3.1). All of the N 2 model-based approaches (-419-4,415 J.lmol N.m- 2.h- 1) were substantially higher than the chamber-based approach, with the exception of the single-parcel approach integrated over the June-July interval (-419 J..tmol N.m- .h- 1) (Table 3.1).

97

General seasonal trends were observed for denitrification estimates; highest rates for Christie Lake were observed in mid-summer to fall (Figure 3.19). N 2 0 flux rates were calculated to be 11-57nmol N.m- 2.h- 1 for benthic chambers and 915-10,635 nmol N.m- 2.h- 1 for the model-based approaches in Christie Lake. Nutrient ratios suggested that Turtle Pond is phosphorus limited during much of the year as is expected for freshwater systems. Denitrification rates determined by the N 2 model-based approach ranged between 10-74 J..Lmol N.m- 2 .h- 1 in Turtle Pond. N20 flux rates were calculated to be -344-131 nmol N.m- 2.h- 1 in Turtle Pond.

Numerous methods have been used to measure denitrification rates which have made comparison of the many measurements difficult. In addition, the physical and chemical characteristics that might affect nitrogen removal are unique to each site (Seitzinger, 2008). However, a general comparison will be made for to determine if the results obtained with this study are comparable to other sites. Seitzinger reported denitrification rates in lake sediments of 2-171 J..Lmol N.m- 2 .h- 1 with rates obtained mainly by acetylene block and nitrate loss (Seitzinger, 1988). Molot and Dillon (1993) used a N:P mass balance approach to estimate denitrification rates of 777 mg N.m- 2 .y- 1 (or 6.3 J..Lmol N.m- 2.h- 1) in Dickie lake to 1210 mg N.m-2 .y- 1 (or 9.9

J..Lmol N.m- 2 .h- 1) in Harp lake (Molot and Dillon, 1993). Tomaszek et al., (1997) reported in vitro

denitrification rates of 40-135 J..Lmol N.m- 2 .h- 1 in October 1993 and from 66-428 J..Lmol N.m- 2 .h- 1 in May and July 1994 for sediments of Old
W~man

Creek, Huron, Ohio (a Lake Erie coastal

wetland) using in vitro N2 -flux method with intact cores. Saunders and Kalff (2001b) reported

98

extremely high denitrification rates using N2 flux technique on intact sediment cores in the littoral zone (1-3m) of Lake Memphremagog, Quebec to be on average 111,000 ~mol N.m- 2 .h- 1, approximately 1Ox more then the average literature rates calculated for oligotrophic lakes (Saunders and Kalff, 200lb). Hasegawa and Okino (2004) reported denitrification rates for Lake Suwa, Japan ranging from 0-1800 ~mol N.m- 2 .h- 1 using the acetylene block method. They also reported a distinct seasonal trend of relatively high rates in spring and winter, and low rates in summer (Hasegawa and Okino, 2004). The denitrification rate estimates obtained in this study fall within range of literature values and suggest that small reservoirs and ponds can be important N sinks.

Mengis et al. (1997) sampled 15 lakes, reporting average N2 0 fluxes, found that they did not contribute significantly to the atmospheric N2 0 budget (Mengis et al., 1997). Liikanen et al. (2002) studied Lake Kevaton, Finland and also found N20 fluxes to be negligible in their study as well as studies focusing on other Finnish lakes (Liikanen, 2002). In contrast, Huttunen et al. (2001) reported mean N 2 0 flux rates of 0.35 mg N.m- 2 .h- 1 (or 25 ~mol N.m- 2 .h- 1) for Lake Ernest, Finland and 0.04 mg N.m- 2 .h- 1 (or 2.8 ~mol N.m- 2.h- 1) for Lake Lacawac, Finland (Huttunen et al., 2001). Huttunen et al. (2003a) reported mean N 20 flux rates of -2.1 to 8.2 mg N.m- 2 .h- 1 (or -150 to 585 ~mol N.m- 2 .h- 1) for freshwater lakes and reservoirs in Finland (Huttunen et al., 2003a). The N2 0 flux rate estimates obtained with this study are within the range of literature values supporting previous research that states that freshwater lakes are potentially significant sources of N2 0 (Huttunen et al., 2001; Huttunen et al., 2003a). However,

99

very few studies have been undertaken that recorded an annual N 20 budget which is of special interest because of the potential for ice-covered lakes to release a large amount of N20 to the 2 atmosphere after a spring thaw. Also, given that --0.3% (4.6 million km ) of the earth's continental surface is covered by water, with the majority being aquatic systems smaller than 1 km2, the total contribution by freshwater systems has been far underestimated.

4.2

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of this study were the use of Monte Carlo analysis to better estimate rates and constrain error and therefore uncertainty in the rates determined and the use of multiple approaches to modeling to again better estimate rates. The use of MIMS which can detect minute changes in N 2 was a valuable analytical tool without which denitrification rates would be extremely hard to determine due to the high background concentration of N 2 in the aquatic environment. The proposed method is advantageous in that prohibitive factors such as cost, level of expertise, time consumption, and propagation of error due to scaling up found in other methods have been greatly reduced. The proposed method is also amendable to the simultaneous determination of other biogeochemical process (e.g. CH4 and C02 production).

Limitations of this study included the dependency on benthic chambers for method validation which have inherent uncertainty in extrapolation from a small area to the ecosystem scale as well as the possible entrainment of air bubbles which can cause severe underestimation of denitrification. The ideal study site was a lake that had substantial depth and would reliably stratify. Christie Lake was suggested as an ideal study site and was thought to be --1Om in depth. However, the study site was much shallower than estimated (-- 3 .5m in depth). As a result, there

100

was little evidence of stratification and due to a year of high precipitation; the study site mimicked a poorly mixed river which increased the difficulties encountered in trying to model this system. Another limitation is the assumed elemental ratio of phytoplankton based on the Redfield ratio made with the stoichiometric approach based on oxygen consumption. Freshwater phytoplankton have been shown to be less constrained in their elemental ratios hence the potential for error (Hecky et al. , 1993).

4.3

Relevance and Recommendations

A new tool was developed that allows for the examination of biogeochemical processes at ecologically relevant temporal and spatial scales and for cross-system comparison. This new method is better able to constrain error and nutrient budget estimations through the use of Monte Carlo analysis. It has also provided a means to improve on previous estimates by better modeling gas re-equilibration through inclusion of additional atmospheric data.

To further enhance this new method, sampling should occur in smaller increments near the surface of the water where the greatest disequilibrium occurs due to atmospheric exchange. This would provide better spatial resolution on the depth profiles. To reduce possible error in the stoichiometric approach, the elemental ratio of phytoplankton should be measured instead of assumed. Once again, great care must be taken when using benthic chambers to minimize the chance of trapping bubbles which would result in underestimation of denitrification rates. To further reduce the sources of error within the model and uncertainty in model estimates, the model input variables of dissolved gas concentrations, depth, and piston velocity should be entered as distributions within the model. With regards to study sites, although Christie Lake did

101

not provide the desired depth profile it was protected and subject to minimal disturbance (e.g. recreational and commercial boats) and there was a fair bit of knowledge of the study site (i.e. tributaries, flooding and draining times). For future studies, a similar system should be used with the requisite depth requirement.

4.4

Directions for Future Research

Future research should include greater frequency of sampling at both spatial and temporal scales within a single system for field validation. This should then be followed with further field validation in a variety of lakes using both the N 2 model-based approaches as well as the stoichiometric approach applied in this study. Additional greenhouse gases should studied (i.e. C02 and CH4) to increase data used to determine the importance of lakes as sources of GHGs. This new method could then be used in combination with other methods (e.g. mass balance) to determine physical, chemical, and biological drivers of biogeochemical processes at the wholesystem scale.

Under the Instruments panel, ensure that GC (not LC) is selected under the All tab.
7. Under the Instrument panel, click once on the Set-up icon. A Setup Instrument window will appear. Under setup type select Method. Under Method, click once on the file folder icon and a Turbochrom File-Select window will appear. Find method and double click on it to select it. Note: If you are unable to locate your method, ensure that the Data Path is correct.

8. Type in a descriptive title under the Base file name and click once on the OK icon. 9. The font in the Status panel will appear red and then green. To view the current status of the instrument click once on the Details icon. You are ready to inject a sample when all parameters read as Ready versus NRDY. Ensure that the instrument panel also reads as Ready. 10. Inject a desired volume of sample using a gas tight syringe into the rear injector port and IMMEDIATELY upon withdrawal of the syringe form the instrument press the RUN tab on the instrument panel. The font in the Status panel will appear blue and Sampling will appear under GC where it previously read as Ready. 11 . Click once on the Real-Time Plot icon to open the Real-Time Plot window and view the chromatogram as it appears. Select the Rescale Plot icon in the toolbar to change the chromatogram view (i.e. the time and scale options). 12. Continue injections as desired as log as the sample run time permits. Ensure that ample time is permitted for the sample to elute prior to the next sample injection. 13 . When sampling is completed, click once on the Run icon and select Stop Run ... or select Cancel Run ... if you do not wish to keep the results and print a chromatogram. The run may be stopped once the expected peaks have eluted, or once the total run time has elapsed. The font in the Status panel will appear red and it will read as No Method under GC. 14. Close the software window by clicking once on the X on the upper right-hand side of the window and then log-off the computer.

APPENDIXH MATLAB PROGRAM EXPLANATION
clc

In Matlab, the results are displayed in the Command window. Without 'de', all previous results will be displayed. By having 'de' (it stands for "clear screen'), only the result of the current run is displayed. This setting is done for clarity but can be disabled.
clear

By having 'clear', all previously stored data (if we previously assigned values to some variables) will be deleted. This is useful to prevent miscalculations.
/o reading from Excel DATA= xlsread ('file nmne.xls'); Having a '%' sign prevents a line from being executed, therefore it is useful for creating headings or disabling a certain function for later use.
0

Having a semicolon ('; ') at the end of a code prevents the values of the variables from being displayed in the Command window. This is useful when assigning values to variables because it would be a hassle if they are all displayed. However, it might be useful to take the semicolon off during debugging to see if we have made a mistake somewhere. 'xlsread' lets us read an Excel file with a syntax similar to the line above. 'file name.xls ' is the name of the Excel file being read, and it must be saved in the same folder as the Matlab file. The 'xlsread' function only reads numbers within the Excel file so if we have words (headings, titles, units) they will be read as 'NaN' (stands for 'Not a Number'). The function may also skip columns/rows completely if they are empty or do not contain a number. Therefore when initially performing xlsread, it is recommended to manually inspect the DATA matrix file.

How denitrification.xls looks after being read by Matlab:

117

o/o measured variables C_INITIAL = DATA(1,3); C FINAL= DATA(2,3); HOUR= DATA(size(DATA,1),1);
T_WATER1 =DATA(8:size(DATA,1),2); DEPTH1 = DATA(8:size(DATA,1),3); RH1 = DATA(8:size(DATA,1),13); P1 = DATA(8:size(DATA,1),14); T_AIR1 = DATA(8:size(DATA,1),15); V_AIR1 = DATA(8:size(DATA,1),16); n1 = DATA(1,6); In the steps above, some variables are defined based on their values in the Excel file. C_INITIAL is set to be the value in row 1, column 3 of the matrix DATA C_FINAL is set to be the value in row 2, column 3 of the matrix DATA size(DATA) will give the dimensions of the matrix DATA, the first entry being the row size, the second being the column size:
>> size(DATA) ans = 1241

20

By specifying size(DATA,1), we only get the column size: >> size(DATA,1) ans = 1241 This technique is useful for selecting a large number of data points in the DATA matrix, so one doesn't have to keep changing the code if the amount of data points in the DATA matrix changes. In this example, T_WATER1 is set to be the values in rows 8 until the end (row 1241), column 2 of the matrix DATA

/o defmed variables SIZE= size(T_WATER1,1); ITER= 1000; Here we define some more variables to help with the iterations SIZE is set to equal the number of data points in the matrix T_ WATER1 (typing 'size(T_WATER1,1)' in the Command window will give an answer of 1234) ITER is set to the number of iterations we want
0

/o randomize o/o convert into new matrices of the same means and variances 0 /o random(distribution type, mean, std dev, NUMBER OF DATA, column);
0

118

T_ W ATER2 = random('Nonnal', mean(T_ W ATER1 ), std(T_ W ATER1 ), size(T_ W ATER1, 1), 1); DEPTH2 = random('Nonnal', mean(DEPTH1), std(DEPTH1), size(DEPTH1,1), 1); RH2 = random('"Normal', mean(RH1), std(RH1), size(RH1,1), 1); P2 = random('Nonnal', mean(P1), std(P1), size(P1,1), 1); T_AIR2 = random('Nonnal', mean(T_AIR1), std(T_AIR1), size(T_AIR1,1), 1); V_AIR2 = random('Nonnal', mean(V_AIR1), std(V_AIR1), size(V_AIR1,1), 1); n2 = n1; ~~change later when n is not constant In this step values are randomized by creating duplicates of the original matrices. The syntax used is random('Type ofDistribution', mean, standard deviation, number of rows, number of columns). For example, the matrix T_WATER2 is a duplicate of the matrix T_WATER1, both having the same distribution, mean, standard deviation, rows and columns (number of rows ofT_ W ATER2 is equated to that ofT_WATER 1 using the SIZE syntax, and number of columns is set to 1).
0

/o counter matrix o/o randint( rol-v(=nutnber of runs), column, [range]);

COUNT = randint(SIZE, ITER , [ 1,SIZE]); For the purpose of the Monte Carlo simulation, a counter matrix is created which will become our instruction for data point picking. Using the syntax randint(number of rows, number of column, [range}), a matrix COUNT is created which has the same number of rows as our data points (number of rows = SIZE = 1234), columns equaling the desired number of iterations, and range of 1 to SIZE.

119

After that, the COUNT matrix is applied as a picking instruction within the duplicate matrices (not the original matrices but their copies which have the same distributions, means and standard deviations) T_WATER= T_WATER2(COUNT); DEPTH= DEPTH2(COUNT); RH = RH2(COUNT); P = P2(COUNT); T_AIR = T_AIR2(COUNT); V_AIR =V_AIR2(COUNT); n = n2; o/ochange later when n is not constant In this example, the first column ofT_WATER contains data points 1145, 321, 1028, .. . of T_ WATER2 and the second column ofT_WATER contains data points 407, 332, 267, ... of T- WATER2. T- WATER has the same dimensions as COUNT.

/o calculations for N = 1:ITER C_DN2(N,1) = fzero(@objfun2, 1, [], C_INITIAL, C_FINAL, T_WATER(:,N), DEPTH(:,N), RH(:,N), P(:,N), T_AIR(:,N), V_AIR(:,N), n, HOUR); end Calculations are performed within a 'for' loop which has a counter N going from 1 up to the number of iterations (ITER, which in this example equals 1000). During the first run, N = 1 and hence the next line of coding becomes: C_DN2(1,1) = fzero(@objfun2, 1, [], C_INITIAL, C_FINAL, T_WATER(:,1), DEPTH(:,1), RH(:,1), P(:,1), T_AIR(:,1), V_AIR(:,1), n, HOUR);
In the second run, N = 2 and the next line of coding becomes: C_DN2(2,1) = fzero(@objfun2, 1, [], C_INITIAL, C_FINAL, T_WATER(:,2), DEPTH(:,2), RH(:,2), P(:,2), T- AIR(:,2), V- AIR(:,2), n, HOUR); And so on until N = ITER The function fzero finds the zero of a specific function, thus the rest of the calculations are The syntax is done in a separate function m-file (refer to objfun2.m below). fzero(@name_of_jile, initial guess, range, variables we want to input into @name_of_jile). The file name is objfun2.m and in order to perform the calculations the initial concentration, final concentration, water temperature, depth, relative humidity, partial pressure, air temperature, wind speed, Schmidt number coefficient and duration of the experiment are needed. Therefore C_INITIAL, C_FINAL, T_WATER, DEPTH, RH, P, T_AIR, V_AIR, n, and ·HOUR are put in the matrices. As explained above, some of the syntax changes as N increases from 1 to ITER. The colon in the parentheses means "all data" (very similar to typing size(matrix_name) like in previous examples, but this way time is saved, and it makes the code shorter and easier to read). So T_WATER(:, I) means all data in column 1 of matrix T_WATER, and T_WATER(:,2) means all data in column 2 of matrix T_WATER. Each column in T_WATER (and also DEPTH, RH, P,

0

120

T_AIR and V_AIR) are input into objfun2.m one at a time, and every iteration yields one denitrification rate. In the end, the total number of denitrification rates we have should equal to our iteration (= ITER= 1000). /o histogram hist(C_DN2, mean(C_DN2)-3*std(C_DN2): std(C_DN2): mean(C_DN2)+3*std(C_DN2)) 1s As the final step, a histogram is created and the syntax hist(name_of_matrix_to_be_turned_into_a_histogram, lower bound: bin size : upper bound). In this example I set the upper and lower bound to be the mean plus and minus 3 standard deviations and bin size equalling the standard deviation. MEAN_STDDEV = [mean(C_DN2) std(C_DN2)] Finally a matrix is created containing the average and standard deviation of the denitrification rate. There is no semicolon at the end of this code, and thus the results are displayed in the Command window.

There is another 'for' loop in this file and a counter N. Keep in mind that this counter N is different than the counter N from the denitrification_mc.m file as they are two different mfiles. The N counter here is responsible for performing calculations row-by-row whereas the previous N counter is responsible for performing calculations column-by-column. Some multiplications and divisions are written as '. *' and './' (having a period precede the sign) as opposed to just '*' and '/'. This is to prevent whole matrix multiplications/divisions to occur, and instead multiplications/divisions occur data point-by-data point:

C MODEL is an intermediate concentration value as one goes through the calculations, and it is a function ofC_DN2, C_MODEL, C_FINAL, T_WATER, DEPTH, RH, P, T_AIR, V_AIR, n and HOUR. Initially C_MODEL is set to equal to C_INITIAL. As we go from 1 to the total HOUR of our monitoring, C_MODEL changes and its final value should equal to C_FINAL. Therefore, C_MODEL is subtracted from C_FINAL the result should be zero. To obtain zero, one performs the fzero function with C_DN2 as our variable.
