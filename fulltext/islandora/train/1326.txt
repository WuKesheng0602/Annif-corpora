ABSTRACT
PM2.5 DISPERSION MODELLING FROM LA RONDE FIREWORKS EVENTS IN MONTREAL USING AERMOD AND ARCMAP Deon Bridge Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University, 2009

Particulate matter from fireworks events are poorly understood sources of PM2.5 despite their potential to add significant quantities ofPM2.5 to the atmosphere. PM2.5 has been found to aggravate various cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses and has been linked to premature death. Each year La Ronde amusement park on Sainte-Helene Island exhibits numerous firework events in what is considered one of the world's premiere pyrotechnic competitions. These individual events are the centre of study for this project. Each event was modelled using Lakes Environmental's version of AERMOD, which estimated PM2.5 concentration plumes which then underwent geospatial analysis using ArcMap. This project details the PM2.5 plume dynamics from La Ronde fireworks events from 1990-2004, and how these events impact a ten kilometer radius around the island of Sainte-Helene in Montreal, Canada.

Chapter 1- Introduction
].]-Overview
Particulate matter (PM) is an atmospheric pollutant which is produced from a variety of anthropogenic sources, most notably from combustion reactions. A growing body of evidence suggests that there is no known threshold whereby negative health effects from exposure to particulate matter are not observed. Exposure to particulate matter has been identified as causing a variety of respiratory, cardiovascular and topical illnesses. The size of a PM2.5 particle can be any size less than or equal to 2.5 J..Lm. In terms of chemical composition, PM2.5 can literally have infinite combinations of metals, carbonaceous products, as well as liquid and semi-volatile components. The more reactive portions of particulate matter are theorized to be responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality effects associated with PM2.5 exposure (Squadrito, 2001 ). A growing body of evidence suggests that pyrotechnic displays are a short but significant source of PM2.5 emissions. Throughout the world, fireworks are used during holidays and celebrations and research suggests that PM2.5 levels on these days are many-fold higher than the normal ambient levels (Kulshrestha, 2004; Barman, 2008; Drewnick, 2006; Vecchi, 2008) Every year, La Ronde amusement park on the island of Sainte-Helene in Montreal hosts an international pyrotechnics competition at which approximately ten half-hour fireworks displays are showcased over the spring-summer season. The PM2.5 plumes produced by these events are the focus of this project. PM2.5 plumes were modelled using Lakes Environmental's AERMOD retail software package. This software package is based on the US Environmental Protection

Agency's AERMOD software. Meteorology data from Environment Canada collected proximally to La Ronde fireworks locations was used as a primary input into AERMOD to allow modelling. AERMOD's estimated plumes were further analyzed geospatially using a variety of tools from ArcMap.

1.2- Purpose and Objectives The objectives of this research are firstly to quantify and describe the nature and extent ofPM2.5 plumes from La Ronde fireworks events. To accomplish this task, AERMOD, ArcMap and meteorology data from Environment Canada are used. Secondly, to analyze the plume results in the context of the geography of Montreal with special focus on possible adverse effects to the population and environment of Montreal. Finally, to make recommendations on how the results of the research should be used to minimize or reduce the adverse effects of fireworks events.

Chapter 2- Characteristics of Particulate Matter
2.1- Particulate Matter
2.1.1- Definition and Types ofParticulate Matter Particulate matter, for the purposes of this study, is generally divided into three sizes; PM10, PM2.5 and PM0.1. PM10 refers to airborne particles whose aerodynamic diameter is less than 1OJ..Lm. PM1 0 is often referred to as inhalable coarse particulate matter because most of its mass is taken up by particles with an aerodynamic diameter at the upper limit of what is inhalable. Most particles larger than PM10 do not reach the lungs but are deposited into the nasal cavities, throat and mouth (US EPA, 2008). The PM2.5 fraction includes all particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 J..Lm. The PM2.5 fraction is often called fine or respirable particles because their size permits them to enter deep into the lung to the gas-exchange region (Brunekreef, 2002). Finally the smallest fraction, PM0.1 also known as ultrafine particulate matter, is that which includes all particles less than 0.1 J..Lm (Barone, 2008).

2.1.2- Primary versus Secondary Particulate Matter Particulate matter can be classified into two groups of pollutants: primary pollutants, which are directly emitted into the environment, and secondary, which form in the atmosphere through the assemblage of precursor pollutants already in the environment. For example, particulate matter can be found in the primary phase in the form of soot directly emitted from a combustion engine into the atmosphere, or it can be a secondary pollutant formed from the interactions between unspent hydrocarbons, nitrates, sulphates, and other pollutants. Sunlight can also be a necessary catalyst for the
3

formation of some secondary particulate species (Schauer, 1996).

2.1. 3- Size and Shape
The most accepted way of describing a particulate is by measuring its aerodynamic diameter, which is the diameter of a particle if it were an idealized sphere of unit density (1 g/ml). In reality, particulates come in a multitude of shapes and dimensions meaning that particles that are of the same aerodynamic diameter, such as PM2.5, may be vastly different in terms of their actual dimensions. The reason that there is so much variation in particle dimensions, even among particles of the same aerodynamic diameter, is due to the different sources of particles, compositions and arrangements of the constituents of particles, and the processes that have led to the formation of the particles (Harrison, 2000).

2.2- Sources of PM2.5
PM2.5 comes from many sources, most of which are anthropogenic (Wall, 1988). Although there are some natural sources of particulate matter as well as particulate matter composed of natural materials, research suggests that manmade particulate matter is the source of morbidity and mortality, not natural particles (Ghio, 2001 ). The main anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 are combustion sources such as fires, internal combustion engines, flares, kilns and energy generation plants such as coal and oil. Natural sources ofPM2.5 include volcanic activity, natural erosion processes and forest fires (Watson, 2001).

2.2.1- PM2.5 Sources in a Urban Canadian City

Throughout the world different cities have different sources ofPM2.5 depending on the type of fuel used for energy generation, age and size of automotive fleet, type of fuel used in the automotive fleet, and types of industry present in the urban area. Canadian cities are fairly homogeneous and as such the sources of PM2.5 in one city would be relatively representative of the sources of other urban areas. Urban areas in Canada are exposed to particulate matter from multiple sources; coal energy generation and transportation sources produce airborne sulfate, and transportation also contributes to NOx which has also been found to come from upwind rural and suburban areas. The rural and suburban sources ofNOx are transportation sources as well as agricultural land uses that require fertilizers or produce ammonia (Lee, 2003). The quantity ofPM2.5 in Canadian urban areas has been found to increase in the summer as compared to other seasons because of the prevailing wind direction that blows more regularly from the mid-west U.S. where a large portion of energy is derived from coal sources. In addition to wind direction, the summer also precipitates increased particulate matter formation due to more hours of sunlight and greater intensity in sunlight permitting enhanced formation of photochemical smog. Finally the summer season also results in greater transport use and energy use resulting in higher emissions from combustion sources (Lee, 2003). Particulate matter in Canadian urban areas has been found to contain several metals; aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, barium and chromium. Manganese comes from MMT (Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl), a fuel additive used in automotive vehicles in Canada. Several of the metals, Al, Ca and Mg,

5

have been linked to road dust. The remaining metals, Fe, Cu, and Zn, are all theorized to have come from automotive use, be that from lubricating oils, tire and brake wear, or engine breakdown (Lee, 2003 ). During the winter season sodium and chlorine from road salt are additional sources of particulates. The use of sodium chloride on roads in the winter is meant for de-icing; however, these materials clearly become airborne as part of particulate matter (Lee, 2003).

2.3- Constituents of Particles

2. 3.1- Metal Content
Many particulates are composed of metals which have been suggested to be the source of many of the health issues associated with inhalable particuiates. Research also suggests that the quantity of particulate matter may not be as important as the dose of bioavailable transition metals present for determining the severity of inflammatory responses in respiratory systems (Costa, 1997). These effects are especially acute in receptors with compromised cardia/respiratory systems. Some of the metals that are present in PM2.5 include iron, nickel, vanadium, and zinc, and most are water soluble making them highly bioavailable. Some particulate matter may have metals that are not water soluble but could become so in the presence of acid reactions thereby making them bioavailable. Metal-rich particulate matter has been found to reduce permeability and cause cellular injury to respiratory pathways. The severity of damage is related to the dose size of metal as well as its bioavailability. Exposure to metal-rich particulate matter in humans can require a recovery period of, on average, 96 hours depending on the type

6

of metal present in the particulates. PM2.5 containing elevated levels ofNi have been found to cause more damage to respiratory pathways requiring a longer period of time for recovery. In contrast, particulate matter with metal present that was not bioavailable did not result in cellular damage like samples with bioavailable metal. Research has also indicated that interactions among metals and between metals and other pollutants may lead to increased toxicity (Costa, 1997).

2.3.2- Liquid Aerosol Content ofPM2.5
In addition to being composed of metals and natural solid materials, PM2.5 can also have fine liquid constituents (Harrison, 1997). These liquid materials will often bond to pre-existing solid particles in the atmosphere creating secondary pollutants. There are several reasons that explain why liquid aerosols bond readily to existing airborne particles: First, particulate matter has a very large surface area on which molecules may become attached and second, the molecular constituents of particulate matter range from polar to non-polar, cations to anions, basic to acidic(Jang, 1997; Lee, 2001). PM2.5 has been found to contain polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which are a large group of chemicals composed of varying lengths of carbon chains with attached elements (Tsapakis, 2002). These molecules come from a variety of sources including solvents, fuels, cleaners and paints. Liquid aerosol sources are major contributors to atmospheric PM2.5 but are unfortunately poorly understood and researched partly due to the fact that the mechanisms that lead to secondary particulate matter formation are numerous and extremely complex (Harrison, 2008).

7

2.4- Dispersion Behaviour
Particulate matter dispersion is, like most pollutants, affected by several key factors; mass of pollutant, wind speed, temperature of emission, topography and elevation of emission. Particulates of all sizes are acted on equally by the forces of gravity; however, greater mass particulates, like PM1 0, require stronger forces than lower mass particulates to stay aloft. As such, a light breeze may be able to keep PM2.5 in suspension whereas it may not be sufficient to keep PM1 0 aloft. In addition to this is the fact that smaller particles experience greater friction per unit mass because they have a higher surface area to mass ratio. This concept is referred to as settling speed and essentially implies that the greater the mass of a particulate, the faster its settling speed (Wang, 2007). Wind speed may act upon a particle by transferring directional energy to the particle thereby redirecting it or carrying it further in the direction of the acting force (Wang, 2007). Particulate matter is often emitted from combustion sources whereby the gases formed during combustion are hotter than the ambient air. In this case the emitted air is more buoyant than the ambient air and will rise until the emitted air reaches the same temperature as the ambient air. The effect that this situation has on dispersion of particulate matter is that it will result in the particulate matter traveling further downwind than it would if emitted at ambient temperature (Turner, 1985). Topography can have a strong effect on particulate matter dispersion as well; buildings can cause increased turbulent mixing causing a faster dispersion of the plume, or mountains and hills may force winds up or downslope altering the plume direction and speed (Plaza, 1997). Finally, the stack height or emissions source elevation will affect the settling time as well

8

as dispersion of the plume (McRae, 1982).
2.5- Health Impacts of Particulate Matter

Increasing exposure to airborne particulate matter has been found to be associated with increasing incidences of morbidity and mortality in humans (Monn, 1999). It has been suggested that morbidity and mortality are the result of damage to lung tissues causing lung inflammation (Fujii, 2001 ). Inflammation of the lung may be the result of the chemical properties of the particulate- be that acidity, presence of metals, organic constituents and other biogenic materials (Monn, 1999). Damaged lung tissues will release cytokines (which are communicator proteins) into the blood stream resulting in a myriad of responses including the release of leukocytes and platelets from bone marrow (Fujii, 2001; Wan, 2000).

2. 5.1-Mechanistic Explanation for Particulate Matters Health Effects

Particulate matter's wide range of short and long term health effects can be explained by the reactive portions of the particulates. Specifically, the acidic, metallic, ionic and oxidative portions of the particulates have been found to damage lung tissues as well as cardiovascular tissues. Damaged tissues will then become inflamed and, depending on the severity and length of exposure, a percentage of exposed cells may die (Happo, 2008). Cell damage is not only limited to cell walls and organelles but has been shown to damage cell DNA resulting in the conclusion that particulate matter is genotoxic and a source of lung cancer (Upadhyay, 2003). As more and more lung tissue becomes damaged the lung's gas exchange regions become less efficient, resulting in lower oxygen levels in the blood, triggering an increased heart rate (Pope, 1999).

9

Cardiovascular tissues have also been found to constrict when exposed to particulate matter resulting in higher blood pressure and possibly the destabilization of susceptible plaques. Destabilized plaques may then be displaced and ultimately cause a blockage elsewhere in the cardiovascular system (Brook, 2002, Brook, 2004). Exposure to particulate matter has also been shown to increase blood coagulants such as fibrinogen, resulting in arterial thrombosis which is the clotting of blood while inside the arteries. This clotting in tum could lead to higher blood pressure or blocked arteries (Mutlu, 2007).

2. 5. 2 ~Testing Mechanisms

Determining the health effects of pollutants usually involves identifying the mechanistic source of the damage caused by the pollutant. Many studies employ the use of chamber studies, a method whereby willing individuals can be exposed to controlled pollution conditions. Unfortunately this system does not model sufficiently the mixtures of pollutants or temporal variations that are seen in real-world exposure (Brunekreef, 2002).

2.5.3-lJose-~lfect

Health effects from exposure to particulate matter have been found to be dose dependent (Fujii, 2001). Many governmental health agencies including the World Health Organization (WHO), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and Environment Canada have stated that there is no known safe threshold concentration for PM2.5 (Environment Canada, 2003; WHO, 1999). The overall mortality curve for exposure to

10

particulate matter as well as cardiorespiratory mortality is a linear curve with no threshold (Schwartz, 2002; Daniels, 2000). Other sources of mortality, such as influenza and pneumonia, show little change in risk until particulate concentrations exceed
50~g/m3,

indicating a threshold may be present (Daniels, 2000).

A recent study which plotted ambient PM2.5 levels in fifty-one cities and compared them to death statistics from a variety of causes concluded that the doseresponse curve for exposure to PM2.5 is virtually linear. The researchers found that a
10~g/m3

increase in ambient PM2.5 concentrations results in a 4% increase in mortality

from all tracked causes, a 6% increase in mortality from cardiopulmonary failure and an 8% increase in mortality from lung cancer (Pope, 2002).

2.5. 4-Sensitivity to Particulate Matter

Elderly individuals have been found to be especially sensitive to exposure to ultra fine particulate matter. Specifically individuals over the age of 65 are at a greater risk of death from coronary events within the same day as they are exposed to elevated levels of PM2.5 (Forastiere, 2005). This pattern has also been observed in individuals who suffer from hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as those with reduced lung function such as asthmatics (Styer, 1995; Kodavanti, 2000). Asthmatic children also suffer reduced lung capacity and lung irritation during bouts of increased airborne particulate matter (Koenig, 1993). The length of the exposure and the number of consecutive days of exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter both result in an increase in the instances of hospitalizations for asthmatic children (Lin, 2002).

11

2. 5. 5-Short Term Exposure to PM2. 5
Short term exposure to particulate matter can cause eye, throat, nasal and skin irritation in sensitive individuals (Feldman, 2004). Eyes may bum, tear, or foam during and after exposure to particulate matter and conjunctival epithelial cells have been observed to be damaged due to exposure. Short term exposure may also result in physical discomfort due to sweating, coughing, headaches or a difficulty concentrating. Medium term exposures, that is, over more than a few hours, can cause sleeplessness, sluggishness and changes in body skin temperature (Pan, 2000).

2. 6-Montreal
The city of Montreal is the second largest city in Canada with a population of i .62 million residents in 2006 according to Statistics Canada. The total area of metropolitan Montreal is 365.13 km2 resulting in a population density of 4438.67/km
2 .

The Greater

Montreal Area, which includes among other areas Longueil to the East and Laval to the North, has a population of 3.63 million residents and a density of 853.62/km

2. 6.1-Montreal Meteorology
Poor air quality episodes are much more common during the summer in Montreal than in the winters (Environmental Canada, 2003). Overall the air quality in Montreal is good and as such is only moderately burdened by air pollution (Goldberg, 2001 ). The formation of air pollutants during summers in Montreal is enhanced by the prevalence of clear, sunny days when sunlight is the most intense allowing for the formation of photochemical smog from VOCs, liquid fuels, solvents, organic chemicals and other

12

components (Environment Canada, 2003). It should be mentioned that Montreal does not experience many extreme hot, humid days that are common in more southern North American cities (Goldberg, 2001). In the winter Montreal has also suffered from increases in particulate matter from wood burning used for heating (Environment Canada, 2000). The mean concentration of ambient PM1 0 and PM2.5 in Montreal as well as Quebec has generally been decreasing yearly since 1975 largely due to reductions by industrial emitters and incineration. Conversely, during this time period there has been an increase in particulate matter from combustion sources (Developpement Durable Environnement et Pares Quebec, 2002). The mean ambient concentration of PM2.5 over the past few years in Montreal has been around 1OJ.!g/m3 (Environment Canada, 2005). It should be noted however that daily fluctuations of particulate matter can be severe owing to changes in types of sources, source strengths, and number of sources (Goldberg, 2001). Comparisons between historic concentrations of particulate matter and death rates have been conducted in Montreal. The results indicate that subjects with acute lower respiratory disease, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular disease died at higher rates when ambient PM2.5 concentrations were higher. It was also found that elevated levels of PM2.5 also resulted in increased instances of cancer, chronic coronary artery disease, coronary artery disease and acute and chronic upper respiratory disease. The average death rates appear higher up to three days after a period of elevated PM2.5 concentration (Du Melle, 2001; Goldberg, 2001). Specifically a 100J.!g/m3 increase in average PM2.5 concentration was found to be associated with between a 6.3 and 25.3% increase in death rates (Goldberg, 2001).

2.6.2-Montreal Fireworks
Every summer La Ronde, an amusement park located on the island of SainteHelene to the East of Montreal, runs an international competition showcasing some of the most elaborate firework displays worldwide. The displays are largely held ori weekends and number around ten a year. Each individual display lasts around 30 minutes beginning at 1Opm regardless of weather conditions (The Gazette, 2006). Each event is different in the selection of fireworks used, the number detonated, the heights of detonation and the combination of detonations. ' It is estimated that each display uses around 2000 kilograms of fireworks in total, which is between 3,000 and 5,000 individual fireworks during the half-hour display (Brownstein, 1996). An image which shows the different types and altitudes of detonating fireworks as well as the particulate matter plume from a LaRonde fireworks event can be seen in Figure 2.1.

Chapter 3- Fireworks
3.1-Firework Chemistry
Pyrotechnic displays involve igniting powdered metals to produce colotrrful
di~plays of varying styles and shapes. Individual fireworks can be composed of several

components; a propellant or fuel to accelerate the firework to a target altitude; often gunpowder, oxidizing agents, colouring agents, smoke dyes, binding agents and other chertiicais (Russell, 2000; Kosanke, 2004). Oxidizing agents are often used because of their tendency to produce high temperatures quickly allowing for metals to excite and thus produce their anticipated colour. This is achieved through the release of the oxygen from the oxidizer allowing for the combustion to take place at a high rate producing high temperatures. Some oxidizers are more explosive and therefore added for their propellant and sound properties. Popular oxidizing agents include: ammonium perchlorate (NH4Cl04), potassium chlorate (KCl02), and potassium nitrate (KN03). Colouring agents are chemicals whose desired properties may include oxidizing but are principally selected for the colotir they produce when heated to a specific temperature. Pyrotechnic displays can attain a multitude of colours depending on the colouring agents present: red (strontium carbonate, SrC03), orange (calcium carbonate, CaC03), yellow (sodium bicarbonate, NaHC03), green (barium carbonate, BaC03), blue (copper arsenite, CuHAs03) (Kosanke, 2004). Smoke dyes are coloured plumes of smoke that are created through the interaction of moisture in air with corrosive materials that hydrolyze into aerosol droplets. As with colouring agents there are a numerous colours available depending on the selection of chemical. A few examples include; auromine, indigo pure, oil red etc. (Kosanke, 2004).

Combustion agents make it possible for the oxidizing agent to become reduced and release the oxygen atoms resulting in combustion. Common combustion agents include charcoal, aluminum, and red phosphorus. Binding agents, as the name suggests, are designed to hold the mixture of colouring agents, oxidizing agents, combustion agents and other chemicals together in a paste like homogeneous mixture. Wheat flour and wheat starch are just two possible binding agents used in fireworks. There are several other chemicals that are often found in fireworks and are used for a variety of purposes; gallic acid is used for the whistling sound it produces when it reacts with potassium perchlorate, boron as a fire retardant, and boric acid to prevent moisture from corroding chemicals containing aluminum (Kosanke, 2004).

3.2- PM2.5 Episodes Caused by Firework Events
Celebrations and festivals throughout the world are often punctuated by copious fireworks displays, be they professional or amateur. Due to the numerous worldwide events in which fireworks are an integral part of celebrations, there is also a fair amount of evidence that these events can cause levels of ambient PM2.5 to surge many fold above normal ambient levels. During the Diwali festival in India in 1999, S02 was found to increase tenfold over normal ambient levels, TSP (total suspended particulates) increased around threefold and PM1 0 increased twofold over normal ambient levels (Ravindra, 2003 ). During an air sampling exercise comparing air quality before and after the Lantern Festival of2006 in Beijing, China, researchers measured airborne particles for a variety of chemical parameters. The researchers found that there were 18 different ions

17

present in the captured PM2.5 including the anions Cr, CsH6ol-, C3H20l-, C20l-, C4H40l-, sol-, N0-3 and the cations K+, Ca2+, NH4+, Mg+, Na+ and that these ions were fivefold higher than prior to the lantern festival. Particulates were also found to be acidic with the larger PMl 0 fraction being 1 pH lower on average than the PM2.5 fraction. Particulate pH values ranged from 6.5 to 4.2 over the course of eight samples taken, four for PMlO and four for PM2.5. The pH results measured during this event are atypical in that PM2.5 is usually reported to be more acidic than PM1 0 and may be the result of specific feedstock or circumstance during this particular Beijing event. A variety of metals were also detected including potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc and sodium as well as more toxic metals like strontium, manganese, copper, aluminum, lead and barium. These metals were in concentrations 3 times higher during the lantern festival than before the festival. In the sampled PM2.5, firework sources were responsible for 98% of the Pb present, 90% of the total mineral aerosol, 43% of total carbon, 28% of Zn, 8% ofN03-, and 3% of sol- (Wang, 2007). On New Year's Eve 1999, there were firework celebrations throughout the world, including Leipzig, Germany where a particle sizer, used for measuring particle sizes as the name suggests, and two particle counters, which count the number of particles, were employed to measure plume characteristics. The results indicate that firework events produce the greatest number of particles in the PM2.5 fraction compared to PM10 fraction. Within the PM2.5 range the highest concentrations fall in the 80-120nm range when the particles are not assumed to be spherical, or in the 120-160nm range when they are assumed to be spherical. In both instances firework events will, at their maximum, increase levels one order of magnitude over regular ambient levels. For the non-spherical

18

concentration estimations, regular ambient levels of 280nm particulates are around 46,000 particles per cm- , which increases to just below 46,000 particles per cm-3 on firework event days. For the spherical concentration estimations, regular ambient levels of280nm particulates are around 280 particles per cm-3, which increases to 1,000 particles per cm- on firework event days. Clearly firework events are responsible for large increases in the number of most particle sizes in the range of PM2.5 (Wehner, 2000). In the United Kingdom each year on November 5th citizens celebrate 'bonfire night' on which fireworks are ignited as well as large open air fires. During one such event in 1994 researchers endeavoured to measure the changes in dioxin and furan levels over previous nights. The measured results were considered tenuous by the researchers but showed a pattern of greater quantities of dioxins and furans on bonfire night. The researchers also conceded that the actual source of the dioxins and furans were unknown and could not be limited to bonfires, fireworks or any other source (Dyke, 1997). Laboratory tests have also indicated that firework plumes may contain dioxins and furans. The researchers found that prior to detol).ation or burning, fireworks contain dioxins and furans in the paper and cardboard containers which is a common result of the pulp and paper process. However, after detonation the quantities of dioxins and furans in the left-over shells are reduced leading to the conclusion that the dioxins and furans may have been released in the gaseous phase during firework explosion. Tested ash particles confirmed the presence of dioxins and furans after detonation of the fireworks; however, the researchers never clearly identify the size of the ash particles containing dioxins and furans thus making it difficult to determine the settling speed or inhalability of the

and the cations K+, Ca2\ NH4+, Mg+, Na+ and that these ions were

Particulate pH values ranged from 6.5 to 4.2 over the course of eight samples taken, four for PMlO and four for PM2.5. The pH results measured during this event are atypical in that PM2.5 is usually reported to be more acidic than PMl 0 and may be the result of specific feedstock or circumstance during this particular Beijing event. A variety of metals were also detected including potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc and sodium as well as more toxic metals like strontium, manganese, copper, aluminum, lead and barium. These metals were in concentrations 3 times higher during the lantern festival than before the festival.

18

concentration estimations, regular ambient levels of 280nm particulates are around 46,000 particles per cm- , which increases to just below 46,000 particles per cm-3 on firework event days. For the spherical concentration estimations, regular ambient levels of280nm particulates are around 280 particles per cm-3, which increases to 1,000 particles per em- on firework event days. Clearly firework events are responsible for large increases in the number of most particle sizes in the range of PM2.5 (Wehner, 2000). In the United Kingdom each year on November 5th citizens celebrate 'bonfire night' on which fireworks are ignited as well as large open air fires. During one such event in 1994 researchers endeavoured to measure the changes in dioxin and furan levels over previous nights. The measured results were considered tenuous by the researchers but showed a pattern of greater quantities of dioxins and furans on bonfire night.

products (Fleischer, 1999). In Valencia, Spain locals celebrate the festival of Las Fallas, which can last six days and involve elaborate firework displays. As with other firework events, the measured mass of particulate matter shows a several fold increase over normal ambient levels. NO levels, metal particles, and S02 were also measured rising dramatically, but less so thah the levels of particulate matter. The researchers emphasized that the measured quantities of metal particles, metal species such as barium, lead, magnesium etc., as well as the size of the particles, around l.2!J.m in size, were generally in agreement with other measurements from other worldwide firework events (Moreno, 2007). Upon reviewing all the journal literature on particulate matter plumes from firework events, it becomes evident that there are many similarities between worldwide events, due to standard chemical properties, but also notable differences which cart be attributed to local traditions and styles for firework displays (Moreno, 2007). One example of how traditions and customs for firework events vary worldwide is the use of open-pit bonfires on November 5th in the United Kingdom, which is a unique cultural event that ultimately affects the make-up and characteristics of the particulate matter plume. Although firework events may be transitory in nature and therefore brief, and rare, the cumulative impact of the event should not be underestimated just as the localized health impacts should not be ignored. To illustrate this point, the United Kingdom produced a study through the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) that estimated the total quantity of metals released in the United Kingdom in

20

2002 from firework events. DEFRA calculated these quantities through two methods: based on the percentage of each individual firework's weight that is made up of metals and secondly through known emission rates of metals per ton of fireworks ignited (DEFRA, 2003). The results of the study can be seen in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1: DEFRA estimated quantities of metals released into the environment from firework sources in 2000/2002

In addition to the results in Table 3.1, DEFRA also concluded that PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and dioxins/furans may be released in significant amounts from explosives used to propel fireworks into the air, as well as from the detonation of the firework itself. Clearly the results of DEFRA indicate that although firework events are small in scale and short in terms of time frame, cumulatively they can have meaningful impacts on the levels of environmental pollution (DEFRA, 2003).

3.3- Studies Linking Firework Events to Health Impairment
Although there is a fair amount of academic material concerning the effects

21

firework events have on air quality there is much less information on how the reduced air quality from firework events specifically translates into impacts on community health. One researcher chronicled the air quality change in Honululu, Hawaii on New Year's Eve as fireworks were detonated and the subsequent effect it had on a few subjects with healthy and compromised respiratory systems. According to the author the concentration of respirable particles was measured to be in excess of3800~g/m3 during the event. Due to exposure to the plume, two male subjects who were already afflicted with chronic respiratory diseases suffered an average decrease of 26% in maximal inidexpiratory flow, the maximum rate of airflow attained during a forced expiration, when compared to prior exposure. Three males without respiratory disease were also measured and showed a 4.7% decrease in maximal midexipiratory flow but this measurement was qeemed to be close to, but not statistically significant. As a result, it was concluded that there was evidence that firework events clearly inhibited the respiratory health of compromised individuals but not that ofhealthy individuals (Smith, 1975). The relevance of these results should not be overestimated due to the age of the results, small sample size and lack of replication elsewhere. Other academic results are based on disasters or serendipity. In May, 2000 a firework storage facility in Enschede, Netherlands exploded and in so doing consumed a large portion of the stocked fireworks. After rescue efforts had been completed, personnel and residents were interviewed concerning the effect the event had on their health. Many workers (35%), passers-by (45%) and rescue workers (23%) reported suffering from one or more acute symptoms from exposure. The symptoms most often reported were coughing and irritation of the throat, eyes, respiratory tract, .and nose.

22

Other symptoms mentioned included earaches, tinnitus, shortness of breath, and vertigo. Although earaches and tinnitus were likely caused by exposure to acoustics from the firework detonation, shortness of breath and vertigo may have been due to impaired airways. More significant than these results was the revelation that rescue workers who wore facial protection or masks experienced far fewer acute symptoms (Van Kamp, 2006). Following the disaster the rescue workers' health was tracked electronically and it was found that respiratory problems increased the most dramatically in the second half of the year following the disaster. In addition to the increase in the second half of the year following the disaster, there was a continued increase from 7-12 months after the disaster. This seems to indicate there may have been a lag effect for respiratory illness in some rescue workers. Even up to two years following the disaster there were still a significant number of workers suffering from respiratory disorders when compared to the predisaster period (Dirkzwager, 2004). Results are summarized in Table 3.2.

Table 3.2: Percentage of rescue workers afflicted with respiratory health problems at specific intervals after the Enschede fireworks factory fire

Source: Dirkzwager, 2004

The researchers did not explain why there appears to be a resurgence in respiratory health problems in the 19-24 month period. Further anecdotal articles are available for review including the case of a Japanese man who confessed to being a habitual smoker. After exposure to firework smoke for 3 consecutive nights he was admitted to the hospital with persistent coughing, fever and

23

shortness of breath. The doctor concluded that he was suffering from acute eosinophilic pneumonia whereby white blood cells coat the alveoli in the lung preventing oxygen transfer into the lung. The cause of the AEO was deemed to be due to prolonged exposure to smoke from fireworks (Hirai, 2000). Based on the literature review of health effects caused by exposure to firework plumes it is clear that this area is lacking in the quantity and quality of studies that is present in the studies of firework plume characteristics discussed earliet.

Chapter 4: The AERMOD Dispersion Model
4.1-AERMOD History and Development
For many years Gaussian plume models have been a fundamental tool for modelling air pollution dynamics throughout the world. A Gaussian model is a steady state model which means that all inputted meteorology, pollutant source and type data are held constant during modelling. The output of a Gaussian model is a Gaussian plume which is composed of different concentrations that are normally distributed around the Y and Z axis (plume thickness and plume height). Thus a Gaussian plume will have the highest concentrations in the middle of the plume and lower concentrations at the edges of the plume. Prior to the development of AERMOD, another dispersion model was widely used for air pollution modelling; the Industrial Source Complex Model (ISC). There have been several iterations of the ISC model each generally adding increased functionality as well as accuracy to the model. In 1991 a panel at the EPA was formed to investigate how the ISC could be improved and came up with the conclusion that a more complex model should include concepts and modules that factor in as many planetary boundary layer characteristics as possible. Part of the reason that ISC does not calculate or factor in many planetary boundary characteristics is that many of the mechanisms and processes associated with the layer were not well understood or documented until the early 1980s, and ISC updates had not kept pace with the growing breadth of understanding (Lakes Environmental, Smith 1984, Hayes 1986, Shulze 1999). The ISC model, although still used, was replaced due to its limited functionality, namely that the model could only make plume adjustments for limited terrain data, had inferior plume dispersion

25

characterization compared to AERMOD, and did not include planetary boundary layer principles which are an integral part of AERMOD. When dispersion concentration measurements from both ISC and AERMOD were tested against real observations AERMOD was shown to be significantly superior at prediction than ISC. AERMOD is seen as a much more holistic dispersion modeler and a significant advance over ISC by regulatory agencies as well as private entities (EPA, 2005). As of December 2005 the EPA has instituted a policy that AERMOD or other more advanced models be used in all applications, ISC is no longer an acceptable diffusion modeler (EPA, 2005).

4.2-AERMOD 's Build and Functionality
AERMOD is composed of three parts: a terrain preprocessor, a meteorological data preprocessor and a steady-state dispersion model. Each module has a separate function that is crucial for modelling the locations and quantities of emitted poliutants. The terrain processor will determine the position of receptors and sources in three dimensions (EPA 2004) as well as the influence terrain has on plume movement (Lakes Environmental, nd), the meteorological preprocessor is responsible for generating the planetary boundary layer (Lakes Environmental) and the steady-state dispersion model functions by modelling the non-stop constant rate emissions from one or more sources (EPA, 2005).

4.2.1-Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and Stable Boundary Layer (SBL) The planetary boundary layer is the area on the planet where the atmosphere interacts directly with the surface of the earth and therefore the atmospheric processes in

26

this area are very different than other parts of the atmosphere. There are a few forces and processes that are responsible for the pattern of circulation in the PBL; friction with the surface, uneven heating of the surface causing buoyancy and evaporation, turbulent air movement vertically and horizontally and differing wind speeds and temperatures by elevation (Inness, 2000). These processes are important to understand for modelling reasons because the PBL is where most air pollution is generated and spends most of its airborne life. In order to predict or model the behaviour of a pollutant in the PBL it is crucial that the model account for the forces and processes in the PBL. The PBL parameters are modelled using several algorithms that ascertain the wind speed profile, the wind direction profile, the potential for a temperature gradient and its profile, as well as a vertical and lateral turbulence profile (Lakes Environmental, nd). Above the PBL lies the stable boundary layer (SBL). The SBL is much more stable than the PBL because there are no temperature inversions in the SBL resulting in strong stable stratification of air and little turbulent mixing (Lakes Environmental, nd).

4.2.2- Vertical and Horizontal Behaviour Calculations in the Stable Boundary Layer (SBL) Using high altitude meteorological data, AERMOD calculates the distribution of plumes in both the vertical and horizontal direction of the SBL with a Gaussian model. The Gaussian model essentially calculates the statistical distribution of a plume based on diffusion, wind speed and atmospheric stability (Lakes Environmental, nd).
I

4.2.3- Vertical and Horizontal Plume Behaviour Calculations in the Convective Boundary Layer (CBL) AERMOD calculates plume behaviour in the convective boundary layer (CBL)

27

using a Gaussian model for the horizontal distributions and Bi-Gaussian p.d.f. (probability density function) for the vertical distributions. The difference between the two models is that under a Bi-Gaussian p.d.f. model the plume is affected by updrafts and downdrafts in the PBL which are not factored in a traditional Gaussian p.d.f. model. More specifically the model will calculate the statistical distribution of the updraft plume and the statistical distribution of the downdraft plume separately, then combine the two, hence the 'bi', to find the aggregated statistical plume (Lakes Enviroiilhental, nd; Wayson, 2003). The aggregated plume is also adjusted for instantaneous small-scale eddies that form in the CBL as the result of larger eddies. In order to calculate the probability density function AERMOD will take several factors into consideration: the plume rise, the displacement due to random convective velocities, the stack height, the mean wind speed, and the distance downwind where the plume is to be measured. When creating the aggregate plume AERMOD does not simply combine both the updraft and downdraft plumes at equal value, but rather it will weight the individual plumes based on the vertical velocity and standard deviation (Lakes Environmental, nd).

4. 2. 4- Pollutants Entering into the Stable Boundary Layer (SBL)

AERMOD is also capable of calculating the quantity of the emission which, in a buoyant situation, will exit the convective boundary layer (CBL) and enter into the stable boundary layer (SBL) and model its reemergence into the CBL at a later time and location (Lakes Environmental, nd).

During each half-hour firework event it is estimated that 2,000 kilograms of fireworks are used (Brownstein, 1996). No data could be located that identify the quantity of products that are converted into PM2.5 during firework combustion so a conservative estimate of 25% of the 2,000kg weight was decided upon. This weight is the same as the PM2.5 value used by Environment Canada (EC) for 9 models EC produced of La Ronde's firework display in 2007 (Joly, 2007). Although each firework event uses a unique quantity of fireworks, 500kg was determined to be an acceptable, conservative average weight for the model inputs. Since each event lasts 30 minutes, the rate of emission is equal to 277.7 g/sec. However AERMOD cannot model half-hour events, the minimum length of time it can model is one-hour, thus it was necessary to divide the rate of emissions in half so that over one-hour of modelled time the quantity of emissions was equal to the actual emissions during a half-hour. As the result the emission
\

rate entered into AERMOD was 138.8 g/sec.

5.1.2- Type ofEmission Source

AERMOD is capable of modelling several types of emission sources; point, line and area solirces. Line sources are generally meant to represent roads or other thin but lengthy emission sources. Area sources are usually considered expansive locations where emissions are non-point and variable in source. A good example of an area source would be a quarry emitting dust from excavation, transportation and processing activities. The final type of source is a point source such as a stack or flare. This source of emissions is the best suited for modelling firework events for a few reasons: point sources are located in a very precise geographic location which is appropriate for representing La Ronde's

30

firework events which are staged from the same part of the island of Sainte-Helene for every event. Point sources, like stacks and flares, can be assigned an elevation parameter to reflect the height at which the stack or flare releases the pollutant. Fireworks are detonated at varying altitudes and as such the ability to set the height of an emission is a crucial tool for modelling a firework event.

5.1.3- Stack Height

Firework events are composed of a many different pyrotechnic units each with their own purpose and composition. Any single unit may be designed for a high altitude detonation or for a ground-level display. The high degree of variation among fireworks makes it difficult to gauge what is an appropriate elevation for modelling emissions. Any single event may contain a greater proportion of low, medium, or high altitude detonations making it impossible to completely capture the individual emission profiles for each event. The stack height for modelling purposes was entered as 250 metres which is a mid-range altitude for firework events in an attempt to capture the average height of detonations. Environment Canada modelled several firework events in Montreal in 2007 and also used 250 metres as the initial emission height (Joly, 2007).

5.1. 4- Emission Temperature

One ofthe parameters thatAERMOD uses to determine a plume's behaviour is its temperature relative to the ambient temperature. When an emission is warmer than the ambient temperature, that plume will be buoyant and rise, conversely a colder emission will be denser than the ambient air and tends to sink. Although fireworks detonations are

31

exothermic reactions it is likely that the heat from this reaction would very quickly be lost due to the instantaneous mixing of ambient air and as such it is unlikely that the plume would be either more buoyant or denser than the ambient air. As a result, the emission temperature for the pollutant was entered as being equal to the ambient air temperature.

5.1. 5- Gas Exit Velocity
The degree of plume rise in AERMOD is also controlled by the gfJ.s exit velocity which is the speed at which the emission is traveling over the threshold of the stack into the ambient air. This datum is more appropriate for modelling the emission of a traditional stack where the constrained volume of the stack restricts expansion causing increased pressure and therefore acceleration of the constrained gas (EPAAERMOD Implementation Guide, 2007). However there was a need to simulate the expansion of the plume due to the firing velocity and propulsion caused by the firework detonation. As the result a lm/s input was used.

5.1. 6- Stack Diameter
The diameter of a stack is another factor that will affect the plume rise, as smaller diameters will prevent the plume from expanding and therefore accelerate its speed. In order to avoid plume rise caused by a small stack diameter, the diameter for modelling purposes was set at 82 m. This diameter also loosely reflects the general area in which fireworks are expected to be generally detonated.

32

5.1. 7- Receptors The receptor network used by AERMOD is customizable meaning that the receptor grid size and number of receptors can be determined by the user. Most models were run with a 150xl50 metre receptor cell size with the number of receptors being equal to the number necessary to cover a ten kilometer radius surrounding the island of Sainte-Helene. A few of the events had a lower resolution grid network due to their plumes being far larger and longer than most other events. This was done so that the computer was capable of calculating-the entire size of the plume rather than a portion of the plume.

5.1.8- Input Meteorology In order for AERMOD to model the atmospheric conditions present at the time of the fireworks event, it is necessary to input meteorology data into AERMOD. The meteorology data used for this project were supplied by Environment Canada and came from a meteorology station at Montreal's Pierre Elliote Trudeau International Airport located to 17km southwest of the island of Saint-Helene. The location of the station relative to the island of Saint-Helene can be seen in Figure 5.1.

33

Figure 5.1- Montreal Meteorology Station Relative to the Island of Saint-Helene

Prior to meteorology data being used in AERMOD it was first inspected for errors and suitability for modelling. Some meteorology data contained errors as the meteorology stations on occasion require maintenance and will return error data such as impossible values for windspeed and wind direction. Of all 13 7 firework event dates between 1990 and 2004, 42 were eliminated due to incompatible meteorology data. This process is further described in Section 5.2.

5.1.9- Number of Contour Intervals and Interval Size AERMOD's outputted contour maps for concentration can be adjusted to display up to 100 different contour intervals. Given that PM2.5 has been shown to have no safe threshold (Schwartz, 2002) and several of the dates modelled had calculated concentrations up to 7000J.tg/m3 , the outputted maps were required to display a large range of concentrations in an effective fashion. A contour interval of 20J.tg/m3 was selected such that the first contour mapped would be 20 J.tg/m followed by 40 Jlglm 3
3

continuing in this fashion to 1000Jlg/m3 at which point any concentration equal to or greater than 1000 J.tg/m3 would fall within the ~ 1000 J.tg/m3 contour. In practice this resulted in many maps where the ~ 1000 J.tg/m3 concentration area was clustered tightly in a small geographic area around the source point.

5.2- Model Validation In order to verify the accuracy of the model it was necessary to compare the modelled results to in-situ measured concentrations taken by Environment Canada during seven fireworks events in 2007. The dates for which emissions were collected, locations and their concentrations can be seen in Table 5 .2.

Table 5.2- Dates, locations and concentrations offirework events measured by Environment Canada for La Ronde firework events in 2007 Date June 20, 2007 June 27, 2007 July 7, 2007 July 7, 2007 July 18, 2007 Type of Measurement Predicted Fixed Fixed Predicted Fixed Location -73.51990845 N, 45.51739109 W -73.52519134 N, 45.52787377 W -73.52519134 N, 45.52787377 W -73.52654631 N, 45.53040258 W -73.52519134 N, 45.52787377 W Concentration (ug/m3) 66 618 840 204 319

Several of the values recorded on dates above are fixed and several are considered predicted results. The fixed results are those where the sampling station did not move for the full hour. The predicted results are different in that the sampling station presumably did move during the event, likely to locate more centrally into the firework plume. The predicted measurements were not measured for a full hour but for about 50 minutes and thus the results are predicted for the full hour based on 50 minutes of measurement. Test models were run in AERMOD for the same dates as Environment Canada measured. The results of these test models are compared to Environment C~ada's results in Table 5.3.

Following modelling, some investigation was conducted to identify some of the possible reasons for the variation between Environment Canada's results and the AERMOD results. During a review of the meteorology data for the AERMOD models it was found that on one of the dates the wind direction changed dramatically from 9pm to

36

11 pm. On July 18, 2007 over three hours the wind direction changed 179 degrees which may explain the large discrepancy between the Environment Canada result and the AERMOD result. This change was several-fold larger than the wind direction change on any other date. Consequently it was decided that AERMOD cannot model any date where the wind direction changes more than 100 degrees from 9pm to 11 pm. The wind direction change for the three hours can be seen in Table 5.4.

Table 5.4- Wind direction change for validation events

Total Change 12 70 19 179 24 11 75

Wind direction change was also evaluated for the dates modelled and it was also found that one of the dates where there was a large discrepancy between Environment Canada's and AERMOD's results could be explained by a large change in wind velocity. On June 27, 2007 the windspeed dropped 4.1 m/s over three hours. This change in wind speed was quite large compared to all the other dates, with the exception of July 7 which was the other date eliminated due to a large change in wind speed. Due to the large discrepancy between Environment Canada's result and AERMOD's for the July 7 date, it was concluded that AERMOD cannot accurately model dates where the windspeed changes more than 2.5m/s over the three hours surrounding the firework event. The windspeed changes can be seen in Table 5.5.

After eliminating the two dates due to meteorology limitations the Environment Canada results and AERMOD results were put to a simple correlation test to determine the quantity of correlation. The correlation coefficient between the two results was found to be 0.534. These results were deemed to be acceptable due to the limited number of events measured by Environment Canada, the fact that all events measured by Environment Canada were from the same year and the fact that several of Enviroinnent Canada's results were predicted. A side-by-side comparison of the results can be seen in Figure 5.2.

5.3- Model Results
5. 3.1- Averaged P M2. 5 Concentration Map

The Averaged PM2.5 Concentration Map was produced in ArcMap by rasterizing each individual concentration map. Using the ArcMap raster calculator, the values on each map were added together and the sum divided by 93 which is the total number of events. This map was later combined with a layer produced by CanMap RouteLogistics in 2008 of hospitals and health clinics.

39

5. 3. 2- Gross Concentration Map
The gross weight of PM2.5 deposited in a 1Okm radius from La Ronde from all fireworks events can be calculated by adding together all 93 individual PM2.5 plumes. This Gross Concentration Map can then be combined with the ArcMap measuring tool to calculate the PM2.5 deposited in a given area from all fireworks events. The creation of the Gross Concentration Map is done with the assumption that all of the PM2.5 concentrations represented in anAERMOD plume output are deposited to the surface at the locations represented in the AERMOD plume outputs and that none of the PM2.5 is resuspended to the air.
._l.:

5.3..3-Average PM2.5 Concentration Map and Dot Density Map
The Average PM2.5 Concentration Map was also combined with a dot density map representing the number of residents aged 65 and greater in a given area. The dot density map was created from the results of the 2006 Canada Census at the dissemination area scale. A dissemination area is a socially and economically uniform area with a population of between 400-700 people. The dissemination areas in the Montreal area are small and densely packed since 100 people can be found in one high-rise residential building. In order to calculate the number of individuals over 65, several columiis of census data needed to be added together. The columns that were added irtclude the population of males ages 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85 plus, and their female population counterparts. These results were then mapped in a i Okm radius from the point of La Ronde's fireworks events. The population density was displayed using a dot density map which is a map that represents a certain number of individuals by a single

40

dot. The map that was produced uses a single dot to represent 7 individuals aged 65 and over. The area displayed by the map is approximately equal to a 3km radius from the point of the fireworks events. In addition to the outputted dot density map, Arc Map was also used to calculate the number of individual aged 65 and over within a given buffer distance of the fireworks events. This was achieved by using ArcMap's 'Select Feature by Location' tool.

Chapter 6- Results and Observations
6.1- Overview
A cursory examination of the model outputs indicate that PM2.5 concentrations on the island of Sainte-Helene during fireworks events in the summer nearly always exceed 1OOOJ..Lg/m for a portion of the island. This central concentration area is surrounded by many closely packed concentration gradients where the concentration decreases precipitously over a short distance, often less than 2km in the direction of the prevailing winds, and less than 0.5km in the directions perpendicular to the prevailing winds as well as in the direction opposite to the;prevailing winds (180degrees). Beyond the area of precipitous declining concentration gradients is an area where the gradients gradually decrease in concentration but increase in area. Although the outermost concentration gradient is 20J.lg/m3 all the models calculated some concentration of PM2.5 from the event in all of the receptor quadrants. The map results for all events can be found in Appendix A.
3

6.2-Wind Direction and Frequency
In each meteorology file there is a measurement of wind direction in degrees. The listed wind direction in the meteorology files is based on a 360 degree spectrum with 0 degrees representing wind from directly north, 90 degrees from directly east, 180 degrees from directly south and 270 degrees from directly west. A histogram (Figure 6.1) of all fireworks events that were not eliminated reveals that the wind direction was blowing from between 210° and 299° for many events, and between 330° and 359° as well as 60° and 119° for very few events.

42

Figure 6.1- Wind direction frequency for mapped La Ronde fireworks events, 19902004
Wind Direction Frequency for Mapped LaRonde Fireworks Events, 1990-2004

180°-209°

These results are further discussed in Section 6.3.

6.3-Plume Lengths
Most of the plumes' 20 Jlglm3 gradient fell within a few kilometers of the 1Okm radius of the base map, although there were some anomalies such as June 16, 2003 where the plume barely reached 5km in length and June 28, 1999 where the plume was modelled to have exceeded 40km during the course of one hour. The latter is likely an inaccurate result as the windspeed during this event was 2.1 m/s which should result in a plume of around 7.5km. Despite the questionable accuracy of a few models, it is clear

43

that the wind speed for the majority of the models directly affects the length of the plume; stronger wind speeds result in longer plumes and weaker wind speeds result in shorter plumes.

6.4-Average PM2.5 Concentration Map Results
The Average PM2.5 Concentration Map (Figure 6.2) may be a more useful tool for evaluating the impact of fireworks events than all the event maps individually, as it is an average of all the results. Several patterns can be observed in the average concentration map: 1. Plume direction is often between NNE and SSE (15-160), WNW and NNW (285350), SW and WSW (235-255), and clustered around SSW (190-215).

2. Areas where plumes are infrequent include SW (220-230), W (260-280), and between SSE and S (160-180) and NNW and NNE (350-10).

3. The areas listed under point 1 are where the prevailing winds are more common and, as a result, these areas are also where PM2.5 concentrations are, on average, the highest during the hour of the event.

4. The areas listed under point 2 are where the prevailing winds are uncommon and, as a result, these areas are where PM2.5 concentrations are, on average, the lowest during the hour of the event.

44

5. The areas to the east of Sainte-Helene Island are impacted the most on average by fireworks plumes (Longueuil). The areas where high average concentrations were mapped are also consistent with the wind direction frequency graph presented earlier. This is because the wind direction frequency graph showed in degrees the direction from which the wind originated whereas the Average PM2.5 Concentration Map details the direction that the plume travelled.

As displayed in Table 6.1, there are 7 nursing and permanent care residences within 3km of the staging area for La Ronde's fireworks events. All these residences are in areas where plumes are more commonly observed and, as a result, they are areas exposed to elevated levels of PM2.5. The residents in these homes are often individuals with serious respiratory or cardiovascular illness and are therefore highly susceptible to adverse reactions from exposure to PM2.5. Since these locations are long-term care locations, it is reasonable to conclude that the majority of residents at any given time will be at the location of the residence where exposure could occur if the resident is outside or in a room with an operi window. There are also two centres in Table 6.1 that deal with mental health, one of which is dedicated to treating children. Although not a direct focus of this paper, it may be the case that some residents in these mental health institutions are more sensitive to loud noises, due to posttraumatic stress or schizophrenia, and thus prone to startling or stress due to the acoustic effects of the display. The mental health institution for children can be considered a location with a susceptible population as asthmatic children are more sensitive to the adverse effects of PM2.5 exposure. In addition to the long term care centres in close proximity to the fireworks events, as listed in Table 6.1, there are also several hospitals within a 10 kilometer radius of La Ronde. These locations are summarized in Table 6.2.

The hospitals listed in Table 6.2 above are areas where a high density of infirm individuals are located, possibly for long periods of time. In total there are over 133 hospitals, emergency care and long-term care facilities within a 10 km radius of the fireworks events.

6.5- Individual Plume Maps and Health Centres
Each individual plume map was also overlayed with the locations of all health centres within a 10 km radius of the island of Saint-Helene. This made it possible to count the number of health facilities that were located anywhere within the boundaries of each of the individual fireworks plumes. The results of this process cart be seen in Table

Table 6.3 demonstrates that there is large variability in the number of health centers exposed directly to the fireworks plume of any single fireworks event. The largest number of health centers impacted by a single event was 36 and the lowest was 0. The respective plumes and health facilities are presented below in Table 6.4 and Figures 6.4 and 6.5.

The number of health facilities impacted by the June 20, 1990 plume is illustrative of the density of health facilities on the island of Montreal. Of the 15 plumes that intersected with 20+ health centers, 11 were the result of wind from the direction of 78° 25° and only 4 from 156°- 123°. The number of health centers on the Longueuil shore is significantly less which explains why the vast majority of plumes to the west intersect less than 5 health centers. Plumes travelling towards the west intersect with areas of lower density and lower total population than plumes travelling westward over Montreal. Although plumes are less common over Montreal, they present a higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to the high population density.

55

Chapter 7- Discussion and Recommendations
7.J.;. PM2.5 and Public Health
Given that there are roughly 2 million spectators yearly at risk of exposure to high levels of PM2.5 there is a necessity that the population be informed of the risk they are facing. Currently there is little awareness in the general public of the risk posed by exposure to PM2.5 and likely even less knowledge of the risk posed by fireworks events as sources ofPM2.5. It would be prudent for La Ronde to communicate the risk posed by the fireworks events to ticket holders and spectators and even offer personal protective equipment such as disposable face masks prior to the event. Face masks have been found to limit some of the health effects caused by exposure to PM2.5 (Van Kamp, 2006, Langrish, 2009) La Ronde workplace policy should also require that all staff use face masks during the events. Many of the fireworks event spectators are not inside La Ronde itself but in public places surrounding the venue. These individuals should also be made aware of the risks posed by exposure to high concentrations ofPM2.5. An effective public health campaign could be one of the mechanisms for informing individuals who intend to witness the event from outside the park's perimeter. A public health campaign would also be beneficial to residents of the Montreal area who may be at additional risk from exposure to PM2.5, such as the elderly or infirm, even though they may not be attending the events or plan to be in the near vicinity of the event. Since many of the events take place during hot weather, many residents who live far from the event may still be exposed through open windows or during outdoor activities as the plume travels downwind. The results of the modelling should also be used in conjunction with health data

56

collected from 1990 to 2004 in order to confirm and quantify the nature and strength of the relationship between firework plumes and morbidity and mortality for Montreal and Longueuil.

7.2- Fireworks and the Elderly Population of Montreal
The dot density map (Figure 7.1) reveals that there is a large population of elderly aged 65 and over within close prox;imity to La Ronde. These elderly are located in areas that experience a range of PM2.5 concentrations, from elevated to extremely high. The outside border of the map contains the largest density of dots and this is also the areas of lowest average concentrations. However there are many examples of densely populated elderly areas (Figure 7.2) in the 20-29J.Lg/m3 gradient on the Montreal (west) side of the map, in the 30-39J.Lg/m3 gradient on the (east) Longueuil side of the map and a large cluster of elderly located in the 75-99J.Lg/m3 gradient on the Longueuil side of the map. This latter cluster is populated by 615 65+ individuals. There are also two very densely packed dissemination areas in the 100-149J.Lg/m3 on the west side of the map. These two clusters alone contain 130 and 100 individuals aged 65+ respectively.

Table 7.1- Number of individuals aged 65+ within a certain distance of the source of La Ronde~ fireworks events

Buffer.Radius 2km 3km 4km 5km 10km

Elderly 65+ 8,190 21,650 35,685 53,695 194,780

Additional Elderly per Buffer Zone 8,190 13,460 14,035 18,010 141,085

The results of the plume modelling and dot density mapping indicate that there is · a very large population of elderly being exposed to elevated, high and extremely high concentrations of PM2.5 from fireworks event at La Ronde. Of special concern are the three clusters of elderly located very near to the fireworks site as these areas have extremely high average concentrations for PM2.5 and two of the areas are located east of La Ronde in an area where plumes are frequently observed.

7.3- Recommendations for Health Centres, Elderly and lnfirmed
The majority of this project was dedicated to describing the geographic pattern and extent of plumes from La Ronde's fireworks displays. The results of the modelling can be used to conclude that the majority of fireworks plumes travel in an eastward direction toward Longueuil and away from the most densely populated parts of Montreal. The greatest number, and highest density of health centers is also located within the Montreal city area as compared to Longueuil and thus plumes that travel east would not be exposing the highly susceptible residents of these areas to PM2.5. However as shown in several maps there are clusters of elderly in both Montreal and Longueuil who are at

60

risk of adverse reaction to exposure to PM2.5. There are several preventative measures that can and should be taken by health centers as well as the general public in order to reduce the risk of exposure to PM2.5 plumes. Health centers should be informed of the risk posed by PM2.5 from fireworks events by public health officials and provided with a schedule of the planned events so that they may appropriately inform their most susceptible patients of the risk. The health centre administration can then decide prior to the planned fireworks events if patients should be restricted to indoor activities. This decision could be based on the proximity of a particular facility to La Ronde; closer facilities where higher concentrations were modelled may not allow any activities or open windows during the events whereas facilities further away may chose to restrict activities only if the wind direction places the facilities downwind from the fireworks event. From a planning perspective it may be good practice to restrict the development of new health centers to areas several kilometers from the island of Sainte-Helene, especially if the health centers are for elderly, cardiovascular or respiratory care. All levels of government, including federal, should attempt to better communicate to the public the risks posed by PM2.5 plumes from fireworks. One method that is highlighted below (Section 7.4) in this project is to possibly include fireworks reporting on the NPRI. Presently by not requiring the input, it sends a message that fireworks are not a significant source of PM2.5 and that it is not necessary to track fireworks as sources of particulate matter.

61

7.4- Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI)
Each year Environment Canada requires that companies that manufacture, process or otherwise use certain substances deemed a risk to the environment disclose how they are transferred or disposed. PM2.5 is listed under Part 4 Criteria Air Contaminants (CAC) in the NPRI substance list (Environment Canada, 2007). Currently fireworks events are exempt from report under the NPRI under the grounds that employees at the events do not exceed 20,000 hours of employment during the calendar year and stationary combustion equipment is not operated at the facility (Environment Canada, Guide for Reporting to the National Pollutant Release Inventory, 2007). However each individual firework event likely exceeds the NPRI threshold for reporting PM2.5 which is set to 0.3 tonnes annually whereas a single firework event is estimated to release around 500 kg of PM2.5. As the modelling results have shown, cumulatively, the firework events are responsible for high levels of particulate matter which may contain high concentrations of metals, dioxins and furans, perchlorate, and other highly toxic environmental pollutants. The NPRI is designed as a tool for informing the public of significant sources of pollutants in their environment. Firework events should qualify for mandatory reporting on Canada's NPRI.

7.5- Aquatic Effects of Fireworks Displays
A large quantity of the PM2.5 from La Ronde's fireworks displays is dispersed and deposited over portions of the St. Lawrence River. In addition to the plumes themselves that deposit directly onto the St. Lawrence River, there would also be large

62

quantities of run-off from the events that would undoubtedly reach the St. Lawrence. Using the Gross PM2.5 Concentration Map, a lkm buffer was drawn around the central fireworks location on the island of Sainte-Helene, and the total quantity of particulate from all plumes entering into the St. Lawrence was calculated. The calculations can be found in Table 7 .2.

Table 7.2- Total PM2.5 deposition into St. Lawrence based on Gross PM2.5 Concentration Map
Area (sq m) 574000 353000 188000 127000 34000 20000 4000 Concentration Range (ug/m3) 10,020-15,000 15,020-20,000 20,020-25,000 25,020-30,000 30,040-35,000 35,200-40,000 40,020-45,700 Midpoint Total ug/m2 12510 7180740000 17510 6181030000 22510 4231880000 27510 3493770000 32510 1105340000 37510 750200000 42860 171440000 Total ug 23114400000 Total kg 23.11

The calculation in Table 7.2 is based on the assumption that all PM2.5 in a cubic meter at the surface settles onto a square meter of surface area. The resultant calculation indicates that, due to all 93 fireworks events, the St. Lawrence directly received 23kg of particulate matter within 1km of La Ronde. This quantity of particulate matter is significant given that a large composition of PM2.5 is made up of metals, perchlorate, and reactive ions. Although there is little information on how fireworks impact water quality, the result of what little research there is suggests water quality can be adversely affected by perchlorates (Wilkin, 2007). The effects that La Ronde fireworks displays have on the St. Lawrence's water quality are not known; however, the modelling results presented above indicate that the cumulative effects of all the events may be large enough

63

to affect water quality and warrant further investigation.

7.6- Reducing Ground Level PM2.5
Currently both private industry and the United States military are researching and developing low and reduced smoke pyrotechnics. Conventional fireworks are accelerated to their objective altitude by combusting black powder; however other means of launching fireworks are being investigated including the use of compressed air which would produce no particulate matter during launching at all. The elimination of black powder would not eliminate all PM2.5 produced during fireworks events as the combustion and reaction of the fireworks themselves produce large quantities ofPM2.5. The use of compressed air would eliminate a large source of the ground-level particulate matter that fireworks technicians, La Ronde employees and spectators are exposed to. Although there are likely costs associated with migrating to a compressed air system, other venues, including Disneyland in California have already adopted compressed air as the projection mechanism for their events (Hills 2006 and Halford, 2008). La Ronde should be encouraged to migrate their fireworks system to an aircompression system as used at other venues. It may be possible to allocate some funding from one or several levels of government to help offset the cost of migrating to the lower impact system.

7. 7- AERMOD Suitability for Modelling Fireworks Events
Lakes Environmental's commercial AERMOD software package proved to be a' good preliminary tool for modelling fireworks events. Although the use of a stack to simulate a fireworks event is not an ideal solution for simulating the emissions from a
64

firework event, the use of a stack proved to be a sufficiently reliable tool once the stack parameters were adapted to the task. The key limitation with using AERMOD was that it required a continuous, one-hour emission from the stack. Fireworks events do not function as continuous emission events but rather they are more akin to a series of intermittent bursts of pollutants separated by varying time periods where the emission of pollutants is very low or stops entirely. Furthermore the La Ronde fireworks events do not last a full hour but seem to vary between 30 minutes and 40 minutes. If more accurate results were sought in the future, it would be ideal to use a model capable of simulating puffs of pollutants as opposed to continuous emission. In addition to AERMOD, Lakes Environmental also sells a commercial product capable of simulating puff emissions; CALPUFF. CALPUFF is a non-steady state modeler meaning it can model emissions as intermittent events or 'puffs'. Similarly CAL PUFF is also able to model meteorology conditions that vary spatially and temporally. In practice, this means that each puff is independent of other puffs and will likely have its own unique plume trajectory and dispersion characteristics. CALPUFF, unlike AERMOD, also has the capability to model the dry and wet deposition of pollutants. If CAL PUFF were to be used to model the fireworks events at La Ronde, more data would be needed to run the model including; a data file on the varying emissions rate in order to model the puffs and pauses, extended meteorology information including precipitation data, humidity, and short-wave solar radiation. If CALPUFF were to be used, it would also be beneficial to model the building sizes and shapes that are proximal to La Ronde in order to permit the model to simulate the small scale changes in meteorology that are common in urban areas. Although AERMOD is capable of modelling building features, it would be a far

65

more useful and appropriate exercise with a puff modeler. Although CALPUFF is a more capable package for simulating the intricacies of fireworks events, it is also significantly more expensive and likely would not prove to be significantly more accurate without more precise input data. The stack parameters used to simulate all events were uniform and based on the best available data. Ideally each event would have stack inputs which would have been tailored to suit the mix of different fireworks used as well as the pace of emissions. If future work were to be done modelling La Ronde fireworks events, it would be valuable to collect more specific information on the area where fireworks are ignited, the weight of fireworks used, the different altitudes of firework detonation, and finally the length of the event with pauses in activity noted.

7. 8- Final Remarks
AERMOD and ArcMap, when used together, are powerful tools for modelling and mapping PM2.5 plumes from fireworks events. Although there were noted limitations to what is capable using these tools, the majority of results are a useful, quantitative measure of the impact of fireworks on urban air quality in Montreal. When the events are examined cumulatively, the evidence suggests that fireworks events are significant sources of particulate matter and these results should be a starting point leading to more research and greater understanding into impacts of firework plumes on human health and the environment. Ideally, further research would be done with more specific input data and possibly the use of more powerful modelling software.
