"Yes, there may be "an app for that" (whatever "that" might be), but there are hardware add-ons for the iPad that are also really crucial." - Kris "

" "I'm ashamed to admit that I have become horribly self conscious about my personal grooming habits as result of this device. No matter how well I wash my hands, scrub my poor finger tips, a few minutes with the iPad yields a grubby streaky haze" " - Kris

"When I first heard about the iPad, I was terrified. I am in the printing industry. I eat, breathe and sleep print. For the first couple of weeks with my iPad I felt extremely guilty. I'm using a device that is in direct competition with print. Little did I know, it would be a great asset to print."

Bonita

"While I was taking notes in class, the professor suddenly started drawing diagrams and explaining his ideas, so I'm like oh shoot what should I do. I found an app that lets you quickly draw diagrams and stick notes wherever you want. The beauty part is that you can export it as a saved image and insert it into any document... I am a paperless student."

"Incorporating an iPad into group work - as more than just fancy chart paper - could deindividualize and collectivize learning. ... [however] the impetus cannot come from the technology alone, iPad or otherwise. It must also come from the human side - students, schools and programs, and their relations to the world beyond the walls of the academy."

Sarah
"The iPad plays a large role in collaboration. I have a group project that involves 7 people conducting food inspections & sharing information is key. Staying in touch is a struggle, but with the iPad I feel ahead of the curve. It is extremely useful to be able to type up my observations with excerpts from my class notes, and send them out while I am still at the premises."

Is the iPad useful on a temporary basis?

"

· Apps suitable for iPad loan" ­ eBooks, News Apps, Browser, YouTube..." · Opportunity to try new technology"

"

"

· Consumption v. Production

"I use the iPad for things that involve my personal accounts (email, courseware, planner, annotate class notes. It would be difficult to start from scratch every time I wanted to use an iPad in the Library"" ­Sarah"

Wider Implications
·Project: iPad, not yet completed" " ·Luxury Item... to pervasive technology" " ·Designing for the iPad / Tablet.
