Abstract

Despite abundant references in the literature on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and on

the specific topic of ethics within the pharmaceutical sector, very little is provided on the general
theme of Corporate Social Responsibility AND the pharmaceutical industry. The aim of this

thesis was therefore to investigate CSR practices and reporting within the global pharmaceutical
sector.

Secondary research was carried out on the top 65 global pharmaceutical companies. Their CSR activities and reporting were recorded and analyzed.

Results indicated that the pharmaceutical industry's CSR practices and reporting follow trends,
models and theories observed in other industries and described in the literature. Further to

demonstrating that most companies within the industry practice and report on CSR, the research
proved that the size of the company, its country of origin, as well as the type of products

manufactured (prescription medicine, generics, biopharmaceuticals) all influence the nature of
the pharmaceutical company's CSR approach.

Corporate Social Responsibility through a literature review that will provide models and theories explaining the rationale for companies to adopt CSR policies and report on their actions. In
essence, the literature review will address the universal "whys" and "how" of Corporate Social

Responsibility. This will be completed by a literature review of the pharmaceutical industry's

ethics and CSR concerns, which will be done by reviewing communication from within the industry and its environment (companies, institutions, trade associations etc.), as well as from
outside publications. By grouping and organizing the identified concerns, the fields which,

within the pharmaceutical industry, most likely lead to the implementation of CSR activities will

be identified. From the information and understanding provided by these first three foundation
chapters, four hypotheses will be developed pertaining to CSR practices within the
pharmaceutical sector.

The second half of the thesis will aim at providing the answers to the questions raised in the four hypotheses, by analyzing and making sense of data collected from a range of written material (namely corporate web sites, CSR reports and Annual Reports) from the top 65 international
pharmaceutical groups. This second half will first detail the methodology used to address the
topic, collect the data and analyze the results. It will then provide the results of the research

through the use of graphs, figures and statistics and their analysis. From these results, the

hypotheses will be proved or refuted, and a match or mismatch between theory and practice will
be demonstrated.

The thesis will finally address any further research needed and conclude by depicting the nature
of the corporate social responsibility activities of the pharmaceutical sector as it can be
understood now from the research conducted in this thesis.

previously believed to be innocuous that was recommended to pregnant women and later found

to have affected tens of thousands of infants worldwide with major neuropathic side-effects
(Anderson, 2005). Numerous acts and legislations in various countries started to be enforced, in order to prevent drugs from being marketed until their "benefits and risks had been exhaustively examined" (Appelbe, 2005). From that point on, in most countries, pharmaceutical companies
were required to prove the efficacy and potential side-effects of new drugs through clinical trials.

The regulations also applied to the manufacturing and distribution of generic drugs. The idea of
permanent patents was revised and fixed-period of patent protection for branded products was

established, varying from 17 to 20 years. One of the effects that the tightening regulations had on the industry was to increase the costs involved in putting a new product on the market. As a
consequence, the industry had to globalize in order to sustain these costs (Wood & Anderson).
A maturing industry

The eighties were a decade that was very profitable for the large pharmaceutical companies thanks in part to the introduction of innovative blockbusters. However, although a period of great
business for the large groups, the decade saw most national companies no longer being profitable. Smaller companies developing niche products started to appear (Wood & Anderson).

The number of biotechnology companies as well as generics manufacturers blossomed. The eighties were also marked by the fast emergence of AIDS and the rapid need for appropriate
treatments.

Acquisitions, mergers and takeovers were the dominant feature of the nineties (Wood &

Anderson) with an increasingly concentrated industry as the direct consequence of the vast amount of capital needed to fund new drug development using innovative research. The funding

of healthcare was also an influencing factor, especially in the developed countries.

Pharmaceutical groups were seen as making too large profits and governments acted to reduce
consumer costs by promoting the use of generic drags. Large pharmaceutical groups absorbed

(or entered into partnership with) small biotechnology companies which had difficulties covering
their costs.

biotechnology and the human genome project are expected to bring better targeted medications and change the pharmaceutical sector model as it is known today. Another foreseen difficulty for the sector is that, although it is not currently possible to copy a biopharmaceutical product, legislations as well as technology are expected to soon allow it. Further strategic alliances and
consolidations might be required once biotechnology products are subject to generic competition.

The pharmaceutical model is therefore expected to drastically change in the not so distant future.

2.2 Current shape of the industry

2.2.1

What are the profiles of the companies?

Today, as touched upon in the previous section, the industry is very different to what it was only a few decades ago. The landscape has changed, the industry is global, the competition is fierce
and new actors are entering the arena.

The global pharmaceutical companies are led by the "big pharmas" or the top 20 global companies (in terms of revenues), which mainly resulted from large mergers and takeovers in the

last 15 years. Representing the traditional pharmaceutical industry, their activities range from
R&D to manufacturing to distribution of drugs, with still, sometimes, the now "odd" in-house

production of active ingredients. The "traditional" pharmaceutical world also encompasses
"smaller" firms which manage to compete internationally, usually with smaller portfolio (Cephalon, Pierre Fabre Medicaments, Recordati S.p.A., Sender Industries, to name just a few), and even more rarely, small, family owned, "one product" companies.

The generics companies are the second type of organizations making up the pharmaceutical
landscape. They provide drugs once patents expire, once the marketing rights are exhausted.
Many of the generics companies are "market authorization holders". They do not own their

production facilities, nor laboratories, but outsource the development as well as the production of the drugs to contract organizations. It is interesting to note that most big pharmas also
manufacture and market generic drugs.

Who are the stakeholders?

According to Domenec Mele (2008), "stakeholders are groups and individuals who benefit from
or are harmed by corporate actions". Stakeholders vary according to the type of industry,
activity, firm or products.

In the pharmaceutical sector, in addition to the shareholders, the employees, the suppliers and
contractors, the larger group of stakeholders also encompass the public and society at large: patients, patient associations, NGOs, the environment, healthcare professionals who prescribe the medicines, as well as healthcare payers and policy makers, the government and regulatory bodies
(Weber, 2006).

Depending on their structure or their markets, pharmaceutical companies will address and meet

the needs of the above mentioned stakeholders with varying emphasis.

2.3 The pharmaceutical industry strategic framework

A closer look at the industry's strategic environment will help to understand the changing forces

that are shaping and influencing the pharmaceutical sector today. It should highlight factors that
can then be reconciled with the type of CSR activities that pharmaceutical firms adopt. The main focus here is to assess the sector using a Porter's 5 Forces Model, a PEST analysis as well as
defining the strategic groups within the industry.

2.3.1

A very competitive environment

Within a specific industry, Porter's 5 forces model looks at the competitors, the threat of

potential new entrants and substitute products, and the bargaining powers of the suppliers and the
buyers. It helps assessing if the threats are high or low and therefore the scale of their impact on

firms. Figure 1 summarizes the pharmaceutical industry's competitive environment as it is today.

The industry has become very competitive, particularly within the "traditional sector" and this,

due to the fierce competition between the big pharmas. The competition is also high amongst
generics manufacturers, especially those acting globally, but less so among the

biopharmaceuticals producers who tend to develop specific products, aimed at treating specific
diseases, and therefore with less risks of competition.

Industry strategic grouping

It seems important for the purpose of this research to understand the strategic grouping within

the industry as rivalry tends to be greater among firms that are similar and this might give useful
information in the assessment of firms' CSR activities.

Figure 2 was elaborated to provide a quick snapshot of the main groups within the industry. What must be added is that, although Figure 2 provides a clear cut of the different types of companies, the reality is somewhat different as many companies are active in several sectors. For

instance, among the top 10 global pharmaceutical groups, most manufacture prescription and
OTC (Over the counter) drugs, but also generics (sometimes of their own patented drugs), as
well as biopharmaceuticals.

Figure 2: Strategic groups within the pharmaceutical sector

2.3.1

The strong influence of the external environment

The pharmaceutical industry is very much influenced by its surrounding social, political, legal,
economic and technological factors. Without going into too much detail, an overall look at some
12

key factors provides relevant information necessary to grasp their interconnectivity with the
strategies and CSR path that a pharmaceutical company might choose. For instance, it might help in highlighting and understanding the reasons why a pharmaceutical firm might put its CSR
focus on environmental actions rather than on social involvement.
Political and legal factors

The pharmaceutical industry, as seen earlier, is very affected by the legal and regulatory systems under which it is framed. It is an industry that is heavily regulated, on national as well as
international levels.

The cost effectiveness of treatments has become a major issue, as already mentioned. In an effort
to tackle ever increasing health expenditure, regulatory bodies and governments are putting in

place a number of actions: they are, for instance, encouraging practitioners to prescribe generics, supporting pharmacists into substituting prescription medicine for their generic equivalent, and in developed countries, increasingly using Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to assess the

cost-benefit ratio of treatments and decide whether a drug should or should not be covered by a
country's health system.

Laws can differ from one country to another. This is illustrated for instance by India where patent laws differ from Western countries' law, allowing for generic drugs to be marketed. The strong dependence of the industry on decisions from health authorities and government decisions therefore has an impact on pharmaceutical companies. They must demonstrate good behavior to higher authorities in order to be allowed to market their products, particularly in countries where drugs are covered by publicly financed health insurance. In terms of CSR, this will have a particular impact on issues such as corruption and transparency.
Social factors

The World's population is growing at a rate of 1.167% per year (2009 estimate) and is aging

(Central Intelligence Agency, 2009). These demographics are affecting the type of drugs and the quantities of drugs that will be needed in the future, especially in developed countries, chronic
and degenerative diseases being prevalent in aging populations. In developing countries where

13

the birth rate is high, it is the young populations who are in greater need of medicine (vaccines
for instance).

Other social factors that should not be neglected when looking at the potential impacts on the

pharmaceutical sector are employment and labor issues and this for two main reasons. First, in
some developed countries, governments are giving incentives to, or putting pressure on companies not to delocalize their production to third countries with cheaper labor, in an attempt to avoid unemployment at home. This is a particular trend in the current difficult economic

situation. The second reason is that, when companies do outsource or delocalize their production, they have to be aware of the labor laws of the country they're producing their products in, and

have to make sure they comply with international labor laws for instance. More will be detailed
on this later in the section on CSR within the pharmaceutical industry.
Technologicalfactors

Of course, technology and science play, as they always have, a major role in the pharmaceutical
industry. Today, the traditional chemical drugs are no longer the panacea, the pipelines are

drying up, and research is moving fast towards biotechnologies and the mapping of the human
genome. Eventually, it can be foreseen that drugs as we know them today will become obsolete,

gone with their side effects and ineffectiveness and replaced with targeted treatments. This

change will affect the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of marketing, but also in many other areas, including the manufacturing sector. It takes a whole different set of skills to work in a biotech production facility. A much higher educated workforce is going to be needed, and overall production quantities will lessen (since treatments will be better targeted), thus leading to
a very different production landscape.
Economic

The vast differences in wealth among countries remain a major issue facing the pharmaceutical
world, and in particular in the way it addresses the distribution, availability and pricing of its
products. As mentioned previously, government spending on health is being tightened

everywhere. The current global crisis will most probably also affect access to medicine for many
people worldwide, especially in countries with no health coverage.

14

Furthermore, it is important to note that by contribution of size, the pharmaceutical industry is dominated by the US, Europe and Japan. "Led by these markets, the total world consumption in

sales of pharmaceutical products has displayed strong growth and is expected to grow further
with expanding populations in emerging markets" (Aruvian Research, 2009).

In conclusion to this chapter, what can be said is that the pharmaceutical industry is a mature

industry, which is constantly being reshaped. This is due to a number of factors of which intense competitive, financial and market pressures, the need for new technologies and new business
models to face the shortcoming of new "traditional" drugs, and of course the toughening regulations which have a very strong influence on the industry and its leverage.

The following chapter will now address the topic of Corporate Social responsibility as depicted
in the literature. It will not look at CSR from a "pharmaceutical" standpoint, but rather from a more general perspective. It will state academic work and review current theories and models,
across a wide range of industries.

(Williams & Aguilera, 2008), and the overall context of tightening regulations, intense competition, public scrutiny and expectations in which companies now operate. CSR is now

described not only as a highly significant trend but also a growing business strategy that
companies are "embedding" in their core operations (Franklin, 2008). With such rising attention, and despite some persisting reluctance from management to fully embrace the concept (Kakabadse, 2007), CSR is foreseen to further develop in intensity and importance, becoming a

fundamental management issue of the 21st Century.(Andrew Crane, 2008) and eventually a part
of standard business theory and practice (Tom McManus, 2008). Yet, despite all the attention, no clear cut, consensual and consistent definition of Corporate

Social Responsibility has so far been decided upon (Williams & Aguilera, 2008). When looking at the literature, CSR even appears as a fought over and disputed concept. In his analysis of 37 definitions of CSR written from 1980 to 2003 in the USA, Europe, India and Canada, Alexander Dahlsrud identifies five dimensions (environmental, social, economic, stakeholder,

voluntariness) that consistently (but not systematically) appear in CSR definitions, and finds that, although most definitions are congruent, there is still a lot of confusion as to how to define CSR,
as different definitions are "often biased towards specific interest" (Dahlsrud, 2008). Van Marrewijk goes further by stating that, based on the nature of the subject, it will not be possible to reach one single "all-embracing" definition applicable to all cases, but rather that the

aim should be to develop specific definitions according to various contexts and expectations. In his opinion, one of the reasons for so many different definitions lies in the lack of common
acceptance of whom an organization is responsible to: the shareholders, the stakeholders or the
society. More is detailed on this aspect in the section on models of CSR.

Therefore, for this thesis, since no "one-fits-all" definition is currently agreed upon, several rather "universal" definitions extracted from the study by Dahlsrud (2008) are given below, as well as one other definition from a CSR guide addressed at Canadian business and issued by the
Government of Canada (Industry Canada, 2006). The five definitions have all been chosen as

they were thought to be easily and widely applicable, more or less regardless of the context, the
company or the industry:

18

·

A first definition, rather wide and almost generic, was developed by the Commission of the European Communities in 2001. The Commission views CSR as "a concept whereby

companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis" (Dahlsrud, 2008).
· Business for Social Responsibility in 2000 defined CSR as "business decision- making

linked to ethical values, compliance with legal requirements and respect for people,
communities and the environment" (Dahlsrud, 2008).

·

The ideas of transparency and benefit for the business are brought by IBLF in 2003 in its definition of CSR as "open and transparent business practices based on ethical values and

respect for employees, communities and the environment, which will contribute to
sustainable business success" (Dahlsrud, 2008). · A more detailed definition and perception by the UK government summed it up in 2001 by stating that "corporate social responsibility recognizes that the private sector's wider

commercial interests require it to manage its impact on society and the environment in the widest sense. This requires it to establish an appropriate dialogue or partnership with relevant stakeholders, be they employees, customers, investors, suppliers or communities. CSR goes beyond legal obligations, involving voluntary, private sector-led engagement,

which reflects the priorities and characteristics of each business, as well as sectoral and
local factors (Dahlsrud, 2008).

·

Finally, Industry Canada defines CSR as "generally understood to be the way firms
integrate social, environmental and economic concerns in their values, culture, decision

making, strategy and operations in a transparent and accountable manner and thereby
establish better practices within the firm, create wealth and improve society" (Industry
Canada, 2006).

Given the above, it is apparent that a definition of CSR should encompass social and
environmental concerns, voluntarism, compliance with legal requirements, sustainability and,
more widely, concerns for all stakeholders' interests.

Because of these definitions, CSR is very often linked to the concept of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), an accounting term that emerged in 1997, where economic, environmental and social values must be evaluated in order to measure organizational performance (Hubbard, 2009).
19

3.2 Why do companies adopt CSR practices?

As touched upon in the previous paragraph, there are a number of reasons which today influence the decision for corporations to pursue CSR strategies. According to Van Marrewijk, companies
either "feel obliged to do it, are made to do it or want to do it" (Marrewijk, 2003). A guide from the Government of Canada (Industry Canada, 2006) describes that implementing a CSR approach brings potential benefits in many aspects of the business such as risk anticipation

and management, competitiveness and market positioning, ability to recruit, develop and retain staff, operational efficiencies and cost savings, access to capital and improved relations with
regulators, to name just a few.

While there seem to be a plethora of potential benefits, the following sub-sections only
concentrate on several extensively researched reasons or triggers leading companies to adopt

CSR objectives and practices. It addresses the available literature in terms of the "pressures"

leading to the adoption of socially responsible behavior, as well as the potential impact on
finance, competitive advantage and company's image.

3.2.1

Compliance with regulations or guidelines

Laws, norms and regulation are powerful incentives for companies to develop CSR policies and practices. As Williams and Aguilera (2008) explain, "laws and policies that governments enact

send a strong signal about the importance of a subject". For instance, environmental regulations
do persuade corporations to adopt greener or more environmentally friendly attitudes and
processes. Similarly, changes in labor laws can act as forces for better labor conditions.

An identified need to comply to a new guideline (such as ISO26000 for example) or global organizations initiatives (such as for instance the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for

Multinational Enterprises, the International Labour Organization Commitments etc.) results in changes in company policies and behavior. A study of the impact of the UN Global Compact on the telecommunications industry (Runhaar & Lafferty, 2009), for instance, demonstrates a degree
of influence of the initiative on the telecom companies' CSR strategies.

Overall, firms see a case for engaging in CSR activities and if the impact is not easily measurable

in terms of financial performance, the negative impact of not taking the "responsible path" would
most probably be even stronger.

3.2.3

CSR and consumer trust

When reviewing the literature and various surveys that have been conducted on consumers, there
appears to be evidence that the trust that consumers put in companies is related to the firms'

behavior and perceived ethics (Dacin & Brown, 1997; Sen & Bhattacharya, 2001; Maignan &
Ferrell, 2003; Pivato, NicolaMisani, & AntonioTencati, 2008).

That trust then translates into consumers being more willing to buy the products from the responsible company rather than from its less responsible competitors. There is therefore a clear

incentive here for companies to "do good" in order to grab market share from their competition
and gain competitive advantage. This is especially true for corporations whose products can be
very similar in taste, look, feel and packaging (Dacin & Brown, 1997).

CSR activities at a more local level can also help a corporation understand the market and the competition and help the company to cater more closely to the needs of the local consumers, this

again having an impact on its competitive advantage. There is evidence in the literature that
consumers of different countries evaluate corporate responsibilities differently (Maignan &

Ferrell, 2003). This research can be used by corporation to better address various markets.

On the other hand, it is thought that consumers will penalize companies perceived as either hypocritical or insincere, meaning that endorsing a socially responsible attitude does not
necessarily bear fruits. The tobacco and oil industries, for example, which extensively report

their CSR adoption, are heavily criticized by opposed NGOs and pressure groups that identify in these industries a dangerous tendency to confuse CSR and PR (Palazzo & Richter, 2005).

Shareholder, stakeholder and societal approaches

Marcel van Marrewijk (2003) records three approaches of CSR. The first one is the shareholder
approach which was touched upon in the previous sub-section. In line with Milton Friedman's view, this view claims that the sole responsibility of business is to increase profits, and that

social responsibility is a task that belongs to governments, not to business. In that approach, CSR
is only worthwhile if it contributes to increased profits.

The second approach is the stakeholder approach in which organizations are accountable to the shareholders, but moreover to all their stakeholders. Stakeholders are hereby defined as "groups
and individuals who benefit from or are harmed by corporate actions" (Mele, 2008). They can
include employees, suppliers, community, customers etc.

Lastly, the societal approach is the view that CSR has a broader reach and scope. Corporations
are seen as an integral part of a society.
Implicit vs. Explicit CSR

Matten and Moon (2008) address the question of how and why corporate social responsibility (CSR) differs among countries and how and why it changes, by looking at the differences

between CSR in the United States and Europe and extending their findings to other parts of the
global economy.

They argue that national differences in CSR can be explained by historically grown institutional
frameworks. They view the US as practicing "explicit" CSR where companies address social issues through their CSR policies, as opposed to Europe where social issues are part of the legal
requirement, and therefore CSR there is "implicit" (Williams & Aguilera, 2008).

They conclude that the explicit model is gaining ground among multinational companies in
Europe, due to the evolution of the European institutional framework which "provides incentives
to adopt corporate-level managerial solutions".

rationales, presenting the opposite views of those who consider "local engagement in host

countries as the optimal form of proactive CSR", against those considering that the "global
nature of many social and environmental issues necessitates globally integrated strategies".
He points out that a global strategy, regardless of its efficiency, might lack ownership and

legitimacy at the local level and warns against the potential flaw of local decentralized CSR
strategies which, depending on the country in question, might be based on lower local standards
and therefore might not comply with the corporation's understanding of CSR.

Observations and trends: influencingfactors

In addition to the various models that have been described, it is interesting to address the factors that influence the emergence of CSR. William C. Frederick (2008) summarizes these factors in

"minimizing the potential negative impacts of alcohol is a shared responsibility" with a stated

aim "to ensure that products are in all cases enjoyed responsibly by informed adults" (Rundl eThiele, Ball, & Gillespie, 2008).

Finally, the implication of the statement from Hartman, Rubin and Dhanda (2007) that a

company's history may impact the way it communicates its CSR leads to think that similarly, an

industry's "tainted" activities and past can heavily impact on how it must communicate an image
of good corporate citizenship and therefore on how it must approach CSR as a whole. These industries may adapt their CSR activities to "prove" their "good intentions", and not to be

viewed as hypocrites. They might also choose to temper and lessen their reporting in order not to
appear inauthentic and gain (or regain) credibility. Different countries or cultures view CSR in different ways

The question as to whether different countries or cultures view CSR in a different way has been
quite extensively covered in academic literature. There seems to be no shortage of surveys,
studies and comparisons between countries, groups of countries, continents, regions etc.

Williams and Aguilera (2008) concentrate on the differences among cultures, countries or even
continents. Based on previous articles and research, they explain that similarities in CSR approaches can be found in countries with similar socio-political traditions and backgrounds. Companies in the UK and the USA are in some studies associated and said to have an AngloAmerican (as opposed to Continental European) approach to CSR. More recent studies, however,

view that the UK's approach offers more similarities with Europe than with the United States of
America.

The "explicit vs. implicit" model that was described earlier is also a good illustration of this split
between various approaches and provides legal and institutional reasons for the differences.
Similarly, and as mentioned earlier, the study from Doh and Guay (2006) emphasizes the differences in expectations and behaviors in the USA and Europe, led by differences in the
process of policy making and the way business is viewed.

Hartman, Rubin and Dhanda (2007) state that culture likely plays a role in how an organization decides to communicate its CSR activities as well as how stakeholders view such

SMEs indeed display very different types of CSR activities than large corporations, simply

because their focus and their resources are very different. The type of CSR activities that large
companies put in place cannot just be downsized and achieved at a smaller scale by the smaller companies. Smaller structures do not have dedicated staff nor dedicated time for CSR.
Corporate Responsibility is, however, a necessity for SMEs in order to become and remain

successful locally as well as in the global economy (Enderle, 2004). SMEs usually adopt a more informal approach (Industry Canada, 2006) and tend to adapt their CSR activities to the needs of

their immediate stakeholders (employees, suppliers, customers) and community (Fassin, 2008).
One of the most common socially responsible activities that SMEs see themselves practicing is
their role as a local provider of employment.

While the emphasis in SMEs is on implementing good business practices rather than on reporting

on their good deeds, they also see their actions simply as good management, rather than a tribute
to CSR (Fassin, 2008). They see their actions as a way to help them keep up with the economy

and the competition and as a tool to remain sustainable businesses.

3.4 Why and how do companies communicate their CSR activities?

In 2001, Peter Frankental from Amnesty International argued that CSR is only a PR invention,

and would remain so until a certain number of paradoxes are properly addressed (including the

fact that effective CSR must embrace all stakeholders) (Frankental, 2001). Even if this view is
not universally accepted or followed, the ad-hoc literature does display clear evidence that
communication is a very important factor of CSR.

In a similar fashion to the fact that intrinsic factors (size, industry, country etc.) affect the type of CSR practices that a company undertakes, a study in 1998 from Adams, Hill and Roberts on 150 Annual Reports from 6 European countries (Adams, Hill, & Roberts, 1998) indicates that "company size, industrial grouping and country of domicile all influence corporate social

reporting patterns", in terms of the amount of information disclosed (larger companies disclose more), the type of information disclosed (depending on the country where the company is

domiciled, or depending on the industry) and the way the information is reported (the reporting

In return, companies expect that the reporting of their CSR activities will bring some positive

benefits such as " increased customer loyalty, more supportive communities, the recruitment and
retention of more talented employees, improved quality and productivity", just to name a few
(Idowu & Towler, 2004).

Interestingly, Idowu and Towler (2004) also describe that studies have found a major drawback

from reporting on CSR activities. Rather than placing them at a positive advantage, some
companies feel that the reporting led to fingers being pointed at them, accusing them of not

practicing what they said they were. The reporting drew attention to their actual behavior, ended
up being scrutinized, with the result of having the reverse effect to the one expected. Finally, it is important to know that SMEs do not view reporting in the same way. SMEs are

defined as being organised less formally and as putting themselves under less administrative

burden than large companies (Fassin, 2008). Furthermore they usually do not have dedicated
staff, nor time to report on their good behavior. This does not mean that they do not act ethically,
or perform CSR activities. It just implies that they do not report.

3.4.2

What do companies report on ?

Hartman, Rubin and Dhanda (2007), looked, through cross cultural lenses, at CSR reporting in

both the USA and the European Union. They concluded that there are significant differences in
terms of CSR practice reporting between American and European corporations. They found that

in Europe, CSR reporting focuses on sustainability commitments, as well as on financial
commitments, contradicting earlier views that Europe only focuses on citizenship or moral commitments. They also concluded that US corporations focus more heavily on financial

justifications than their European counterparts, but that US companies also report on their sustainability commitment, contradicting again earlier views that US corporations solely used economic justifications to substantiate their CSR activities. These differences in communication
not only denote different practices, focuses and expected outcomes from companies' CSR

practices, but are also indicators of different perceptions and expectations from the "audience to whom the communication is addressed" (Hartman, Rubin, & Dhanda, 2007).

One issue in terms of communication and evaluation of CSR practices is that, given the extent of

the differences in the way companies report, there is a strong need for some common reporting
practices or standards (Thomas, 2001; Idowu & Towler, 2004; Andrew Crane, 2008). Audits

should be prevalent in order to standardize and make comparison of reports, and therefore of
practice, more accurate. Benchmarks of CSR activities across corporations will only be possible
thanks to consistent reporting frameworks.

In summary, reporting of CSR practices has become a must do exercise for many reasons. However, it has to be clearly and strategically defined, bordered and decided upon, in order to
address the appropriate audience, and pass on the right messages.

In conclusion to this chapter, CSR is a well studied, well defined topic which has drawn and still

draws a lot of attention from academic researchers in all sectors and all over the globe. It is a field that has been studied from various angles and through the use of various samples. Models
and theories have been developed and can be used to characterize and understand the CSR

practices of a company. They also help in assessing why companies adopt different approaches,
or on the opposite, why some companies with similarity in their profiles approach CSR from

similar angles. One crucial point to note for the remainder of this thesis is the evidence found in

the literature that the size, the country of origin and the industry have a strong influence on the
type of CSR activities developed and communicated on.

The following chapter will now look at the specificities of ethics and CSR within the pharmaceutical sector, through a literature review of internal or external sources.

4.

LITERATURE REVIEW ON ETHICS AND CSR IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRY

The pharmaceutical industry is, by nature, a sector where the ideas of corporate involvement,

responsibility towards patients, ethical behavior and an overall duty towards society are omnipresent. As David R Brennan, CEO of Astra Zeneca expresses, responsibility is "embedded" in the business and strategy of pharmaceutical companies "because it (is considered) critical to continued success" (Astra Zeneca, 2009). The pharmaceutical industry has for decades been developing, and continues to bring, cures to diseases and affections worldwide. Yet, although individuals and most governments alike see health as a priority and access to health as a right, 80% of the world population (Sanofi-Aventis, 2007) has no or very little access to medicine. The pharmaceutical industry continues to be on the political and social agendas and
make the headlines.

This section offers a literature review of the industry's CSR concerns and identifies the areas of the pharmaceutical business which are the most prone to lead to CSR activities. The following paragraphs take a look at corporate social responsibility in the pharmaceutical sector,

encompassing environmental, social and governance issues, both from an insiders' perspective,
by outlining CSR activities as reported by companies, institutions, and trade associations, and

from an outsider's perspective by exploring publications, books and articles particularly focusing
on the importance of the concept of ethics within the sector.

4.1 Drug development

This entire section on drug development highlights concerns which are very particular to the industry. They therefore lead to the implementation of CSR activities which are also very

industry specific, although aspects such as animal testing and ethics in research can be shared by
other industries such as the cosmetics industry, or the medical device sector for instance.

35

Need for R&D and innovation

Today, the need for R&D and innovation is great, maybe greater than ever. In the developed world, access to medicines is becoming a society's demand and an ever increasing expectation from patients. Yet, in spite of the significant amount of medicines that have been developed over
the decades, there are still many diseases which have not been addressed or for which

appropriate treatments have yet to be developed. Many patients suffering of orphan diseases (or

rarely occurring diseases) are waiting for appropriate treatments, and parents with sick children
desperately watch for medicines adapted to pediatric needs. Additionally, in the developing
world, thanks to globalization and global communication, people are more aware of what
treatments are potentially available and, in return, have increased expectations. Moreover,

populations are rising, and on the whole, aging. People are living longer and rightly expect
appropriate care all along their life. Finally, and as seen recently in the case of the porcine flu,

the event of a pandemic, and its potentially devastating effects on a global scale, is something that humanity has to face on recurrent occasions, calling for fast and efficient drug development
and easy access to most populations.

All these factors contribute to the fact that research and development (R&D) remains a primary necessity in the pharmaceutical sector. The pharmaceutical sector has and feels a responsibility
in discovering, developing and delivering medicines and vaccines that can make a difference in people's lives and create a healthier future (Merck, 2009). However, any new drug, any new

medical advance comes from years of research and development by pharmaceutical companies. The development of a new drug is a progressive filtering process (Taylor, 2005). Typically, of a
starting pool of 10,000 molecules screened as potential new drugs, only a dozen will make it to

preclinical trials. Eventually, after clinical trials on animals then humans, only one or two of the original 10,000 molecules will make it to the ultimate marketing authorization stage and
commercialization to patients (Les Entreprises du Medicament, 2008).

Overall, the process will take 7 to 12 years to complete, with a cost of development reported to be US$800 million for each drug (Dickson & Gagnon, 2004). Understandably, with such lengthy processes and need for extensive investment, and given the fact that developments of drug"s are

the endeavors of private entities, only companies with substantial profits can re-inject their

technologies do not give all the data necessary to carry the clinical trials further, as computer

simulations cannot yet address the interactions between different body organs (Taylor, 2005) and
give all the required information and reassurance that the drug can be tested on humans.

This calls for pharmaceutical companies to adopt and enforce very stringent company policies
and welfare procedures, and promote the respect for the animals being used for the test, whether
the animal testing is done in house, or performed by contracting companies.
Ethical considerations in clinical trials

When pursuing clinical research, companies have to comply with a number of ethical concepts
and standards including the protection of the people involved in the study as well as a
commitment to scientific objectivity (Weber, 2006).

Research participants have to be protected in terms of safety while taking the trial product, as well as in terms of confidentiality and privacy. They have to understand and to consent to the
trial they participate in. This is even enhanced when clinical trials are conducted in developing countries. The involvement of local health authorities, and more specifically of local ethics committees (Les Entreprises du Medicament, 2007), becomes necessary in order to conduct the

trials to an appropriate level of standard (Weber, 2006). Independent follow-up committees also should be implemented to provide the best possible protection against bias (Les Entreprises du
Medicament, 2007).

Objectivity has to be ensured when conducting clinical trials. The attention given to the design of
the clinical trial is a step in the right direction (Weber, 2006), and so is the suitable payment of

research participants. Payments or retributions should be reviewed by an ethical committee to

avoid irregularities that could favor the results of the trials. Overall, transparency, objectivity and
ethics are of essence when conducting clinical trials.
Pediatric research

Further to the issues mentioned above, the context of pediatric medicine is even more Sensitive and prone to issues of ethics. For decades and for "protectiveness reasons", no research was
carried out on children, and treatments were given on a "weight based metric derived from adult

pharmaceutical company whose product is copied, and the risk incurred by the patient taking a
counterfeit, and either totally ineffective or potentially lethal drug.

In the developing countries, the issues are for patients to be able to access the medicine. In many
countries, patients will not be able to afford the medicine, at least not at the prices it is sold at in
developed countries.

Although these concerns are very linked to the nature of the industry, topics such as the

importance ofprotection against counterfeit can be observed in other industries, such as the toys industry for instance where protecting consumers against counterfeits and their potential
harmfulness is of particular importance.
Patient's protection against counterfeit

Counterfeit drugs are a growing concern affecting the developed and the developing world.
Counterfeits do not only concern prescription medicine, there are also counterfeited generic

drugs. Counterfeit drugs either contain the wrong active ingredients, the right ingredient but in

the wrong dosage, or no active ingredient at all (IFPMA, 2009). Patients taking counterfeit drugs
are at high risks of not being treated and being badly treated, with the worst scenario of severe secondary effects which might go as far as inducing death. Industry associations, manufacturers

and legislators understand the seriousness of the issue and play a vital role in informing patients

about the risks and raising awareness. In terms of the risk incurred by companies, a counterfeit
drug's distribution under a brand name can have serious effects on the company's reputation.
Access to drugs in developing countries

The pharmaceutical industry can have an important impact on the distribution and availability of
drugs in developing countries. For instance, companies, as part of their CSR activities, act by

donating medicines to populations in need, by proposing preferential pricing in the world poorest
countries in an effort to help fighting diseases such as AIDS and malaria (EFPIA, 2009), or in

supplying vaccines to international NGOs or UN agencies at preferential prices, below those
practiced on developed countries.

40

Price policies

In line with what was described above, companies can adopt preferential price policies, i.e. adapt their prices to the markets they are addressing, allowing for a wider part of the population to access healthcare. Differences in countries' approach in terms of reimbursement, health coverage, government or private health policies can lead to products being marketed under varying tariffs. Price policies and patient assistance programs are of particular importance in the
USA, where many are not covered by any medical insurance. Such programs help people without prescription coverage save on medicines or even qualify to get free prescription medicine (Pfizer,
2009).
Relations with patient groups and NGOs

Close relationship and dialogue with patient groups is essential for the pharmaceutical industry in order to improve the products, develop new therapies, identify needs etc. This needs to be done within a context of transparency and ethics. Industry associations as well as companies
have developed codes of conducts on order to frame these dialogues and exchanges (EFPIA,
2009).

The role that the industry can also play is one of communication with the patients and associations, in order to work towards common goals. Targeting patient organizations or NGOs on the importance of early diagnostics, in cases of cancers or specific diseases for instance, can ensure earlier access to medicine and provide better treatment and efficiency for patients (Les

Entreprises du Medicament, 2007).
In terms of pandemics such as the propagation of AIDS for instance, the dialogue that companies and NGOs have will help identify ways to lower the proliferation of the disease or at least to
permit for more patients to have access to proper treatments.

4.3 Environment and safety

There are a number of issues at stake when looking at the pharmaceutical industry and its impact
on the environment. The pharmaceutical industry is a manufacturing industry which, like many
41

other industrial operations, carries environmental risks. The pharmaceutical industry, as said

before, mainly emerged as a by-product of the chemical industry and still today, the vast
majority of drugs are produced through chemical processes. Chemical processes have come a

long way and tend to be "greener". Many regulations have been put in place in order to either
reduce the use of solvents and potential polluters, or control their discharge.

Taking care of the environment is also a way for the pharmaceutical industry (as well as for other
sectors) to save on spending. From green buildings, energy saving and packaging reduction,

there are many solutions that can be put in place and achieve both goals of being a good citizen
and saving money at the same time, at least in the longer run.
Water

While the pharmaceutical industry uses less water than some other industry (Pfizer, 2009), it still relies on large supplies of water for its R&D and manufacturing facilities. It is a responsibility of the industry to conserve water, evaluate the appropriate use of water and carefully gauge its
needs with the objective of not depriving local communities of their supply of clean potable
water. There is also a strong need for water treatment, in the same effort to not contaminate the
water used by the local communities.
Environmental protection, building green etc.

Pharmaceutical operations usually require large sites, whether for production or administrative
purposes. Optimizing the energy consumption by adopting green policies can greatly affect a

site, benefiting the environment as well as the company's bottom line. Genzyme Corporation,

one of the leaders in biotechnology, led the way and communicated heavily when it built its new
corporate headquarters according to the LEED standard of Green Building (Genzyme

Corporation, 2009). The impact was felt on the company's image, being seen as a responsible company in terms of environment, as well as on its future savings in terms of energy
consumption.

clearly assessed and even audited. Pharmaceutical groups must pay closer attention to choosing their partners and contractors, in a very similar approach to what other industries, such as the
apparel industry for instance, have had to address.

4.5 Philanthropy

Philanthropy based CSR activities are of course not specific to the pharmaceutical sector and philanthropy is probably the category that first comes to mind when evoking CSR. However i in

the pharmaceutical industry, it is the type of activities implemented that characterize the sector,
which go beyond supporting arts or community involvement. The main philanthropic role that can and should be attributed to the pharmaceutical industry is its prerogative to enhance human life and its role to provide cures for diseases. The pharmaceutical industry also takes on a number of activities which can be classified within the philanthropic category, as follows:
Access to healthcare

Access to healthcare is a major issue in the pharmaceutical sector. Indeed, the objective and

finality of pharmaceutical companies is to provide healthcare to patients, but it is also to make
profits. Drugs have to be distributed and provided to various populations with very different
means. The responsibility of the industry is to work with institutions in order to design schemes

that will allow most to access healthcare regardless of their revenues, the country they live in etc.
Humanitarian action - Foundations  Community

Pharmaceutical companies often set up foundations, in order to support, educate and better

address a disease for which they provide treatment (for example a foundation on diabetes if the
company provides insulin treatment; or a foundation which focuses on AIDS education in Africa
for a company providing anti retroviral drugs etc.).

They also provide humanitarian action and support to various causes, often again in correlation
to a product they provide, or to support a community they work with, or a country where they
manufacture or undergo clinical trials.

their corporate governance, either within the financial section or as part of the CSR/sustainability
information provided by their corporate communication.
Transparency and ethics

Transparency is an attribute that is expected from a pharmaceutical company at every stage of its operations. As it is from most sectors, transparency is indeed expected in terms of corporate
governance, political contributions, lobbying and financial disclosure. But it is also demanded on

other issues and specific aspects of the industry, such as clinical trials, the quality of the

ingredients used in formulations, the company's supply chain, the potential side effects of drugs
and the methods used by the company to promote its products.
Ethical standards and marketing

In some countries, the marketing of drugs is a major issue that involves patients (even the public if advertising is authorized), the industry, practitioners and regulators. Marketing has become a
very regulated activity following what has been described and criticized as "abuses".

There are conflicting interests between the fact that practitioners need to be informed on the

drugs, that patients should have some understanding of the treatment they are getting and the fact that companies push for their product against the competitors' ones, in a bid to get market share. In the USA for instance, television advertising for drugs is authorized, under certain conditions, leading to some ethical issues in what is called there Direct-to-Consumer-Marketing (DTCA).
Even practitioners can have difficulties being unbiased and prescribing what is best for their
patients.

The pharmaceutical companies representatives, by approaching the physicians directly, induce
conflict of interest situations where the doctors' interests or commitments compromise their

independent judgment and their loyalty to patients (Weber, 2006). Weber describes that although physicians think they are "immune" from being influenced by pharmaceutical companies, they
actually don't necessarily realize the extent to which marketing is influencing them, and unconsciously prescribe medicine A rather than its competitor B, compromising their own ethics

and allegiance to objectivity and to treating their patients as best as possible. It seems that within

number of them can be directly pinpointed to the pharmaceutical sector. Ethics plays a large role in the way business is conducted and this has a strong influence on the way pharmaceutical
companies approach their corporate responsibility.

In the following chapter, and based on the last three chapters including this one, four hypotheses

will be drawn on the narrowed topic of Corporate Social Responsibility AND the pharmaceutical
sector.

Due to the variety of products that can be produced in the pharmaceutical sector (prescription

drugs, generics, biotech therapies etc.), the variety in the "seriousness" of the pathologies being
addressed (from HIV, mental illnesses, cancers, orphan diseases to common cold), or even the potential polluting or contaminating effect of certain production processes, discrepancies are
expected, in terms of focus and the variety of CSR activities put in place. Likewise, common pattern of CSR focus are expected amongst companies providing similar products. This gives
rise to Hypothesis 3, or H3.

H3: The nature of the products manufactured influences the type of CSR activities.

Due to the wide differences in regulatory requirements, government policies, social and political
pressures, economic context, cultures and even societies' expectations within various countries,

geographical discrepancies in terms of CSR focus are expected. Corporations headquartered either in North America, Europe or Asia are expected to approach CSR according to a regional understanding of what the concept stands for and entails. This gives rise to Hypothesis 4, or H4. H4: The country of origin and the socio-political context influence the pharmaceutical
company's CSR approach.

The aim of the research from here on will be to prove or refute the above four hypotheses. The following section will detail the methodology used in order to achieve this goal.

6.

METHODOLOGY

The aim of the research is to analyze and compare the CSR activities reporting of a large sample of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies of global reach.

The methodology chosen for this study was based on content analysis using qualitative and
quantitative data analysis. The documents and sources of data analyzed were of several types: web sites (corporate or

specific to CSR), CSR Reports (also called Sustainability Reports or Citizenship reports), Annual
Reports and, in some instances, Environmental Reports.

The following paragraphs detail the process used for the collection and the analysis of the data.

6.1 Identifying the sector's responsibility concerns

The methodology for assessing the sector's CSR concerns was based on a review of the content of internet sites from relevant industry organizations, such as trade associations, international representative bodies, and regulators. The review of several reference books on the topic of ethics and the pharmaceutical sector and well as the review of corporate websites from leading
companies helped shape this part of the research.

6.1.1

Objective

The objective was to identify the overall CSR concerns of the industry (and particularly those specific to the sector, as opposed to the ones more common to all industries), define, clarify,
explain them and highlight their relevance.

The other aim of this research was to use this information to develop the database and decide on
the set of fields needed for the second part of this research.

51

6.1.2

Choosing the sample

Choosing the sample consisted of identifying relevant industry organizations, accessing data or their websites, identifying patterns in terms of areas of expressed concerns and extracting the
relevant information.

Some of the organizations that were identified and from which information on CSR roles and
concerns were extracted are the following:
Name of
organization

Designation

EFPIA
EMEA FDA

European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations
European Medicines Agency US Food and Drug Administration

FIP

International Pharmaceutical Federation

IFPMA LEEM

PhRMA Rx&D

Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America _ Canada VResearch B^sed^harmaceutical Companies

International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations Les Entreprises du Medicament, the French Pharmaceutical Companies Association

Table 5: List of selected Industry Organizations

6.1.3

Defining the information to review and collecting the information

Once the sample was determined, the web sites were accessed, reviewed for patterns and the
information used to compile and describe the main concerns of the sector.

The results were given in Chapter 4 of this thesis, as well as listed in Appendix A (fields defined
and used for collecting data under the CSR activities category).

6.2 Defining the industry's current CSR practices 6.2.1 Choosing the sample

The first step of the study was to define the sample of companies to study. The sample had to
address all four hypotheses, and had to be large and representative enough to cover various countries of origin and regions, a wide panel of sizes of firms, different types of products offered

The three original lists, as well as the list of 70 (reduced to 65) companies are given in
Appendices B and C.

6.2.2

Defining the data to collect

The next step was to define what information needed to be collected. The objective was to gather
information on the business identity of the company as well as its CSR activities.
This was to be done by gathering information on three main categories:
· A general information category, providing the identity of the company:
o company name

o

corporate web site

o

number of employees

o
o

annual revenues (in local currencies where supplied, as well as in US dollars)
country of origin

o

regions where the company operates through subsidiaries, local companies, sales office etc. A total of 9 regions were defined (please see Table 7 for more detail).

o

type of products

 


prescription medicines consumer healthcare (OTC)
generic drugs



biopharmaceuticals including vaccines



others (medical devices, nutritional products etc.)

o

therapeutic areas currently addressed (13 therapeutic areas were identified, please
see Appendix A for more details).

·

A second category providing a brief accounting of the place where CSR activities are
reported by each company, with the choice of four options: o
o o

information on the company's corporate web site
presence of a dedicated CSR website presence of a CSR dedicated report

54

o

in the absence of a dedicated CSR report, presence or not of CSR information
within the company's Annual Report.

·

Lastly, a more detailed category accounting for the company's reported CSR activities and constructed from the literature review of the pharmaceutical industry's CSR practices (part 4). For this part, six sub-categories of CSR activities (please see Appendix A) were determined, encompassing a total of 46 CSR activities. The six sub-categories were:
o
o

drug development
patients

o o o
o

environment and safety social issues philanthropy
business ethics

It is important to note that from the original fields, criteria were added in several categories or

sub-categories as the coding went on. When that occurred, companies previously coded were
reassessed and the coding was corrected accordingly.

6.2.3

Coding the data

A simple coding template was designed.
Countries of origin

16 countries of origin were identified and coded as follows:
Code
1

Country

Code

Country Japan

Canada
USA
Germany

2

China India

Table 6: Codes for Countries of Origin

55

Note: Although China was listed prior to starting the research, it was eventually not used as a country of origin. None of the 65 studied company originated from China. China was however

often cited (and therefore coded) as a region where companies have operations in.
Regions of origin

Similarly, 9 regions were defined and coded as follows to identify the region of origin of the
company:

Code
1

Region
EU

Code 6 7 8

Region South Asia China India

2 3
4 5

North America South America
Africa Middle East incl. Israel

9

Australasia incl. Japan

Table 7: Codes for Regions of Origin
Regions operating in

As far as the regions the companies have operations in, the coding used was the number "1"

when evidence was found that a company had operation in a region, and "0" otherwise.
Operations were defined as either: sales offices, subsidiaries, production sites, regional
headquarters etc.

For example, if a company was found to operate in the EU, Africa and South America, it was

assigned a "1" to the designated cells and a "0" to the other cells. The maximum number of
regions a company could operate in was therefore 9, and the minimum 1 (the region
corresponding to the country of origin of the company).
Reporting; Therapeutic areas; Type of products

The coding used for the following categories: "reporting", "therapeutic areas" and "type of
products", was the numbers "1" when evidence of the criterion was found and "O" if no
evidence was found in the accessed documents or sources of data.

For instance, if a company indicated that it was active in oncology, then a "1" would be assigned to the designated cell on the datasheet. Similarly, if the company reported producing generics

Revenues were downloaded from 2008 Annual Reports, except for Actavis for which the
revenues were extracted from the 2006 Annual Report, the last publicly available report before

Actavis went private, and for Japanese companies for which the financial fiscal year ends at the

end of March, and for which the Annual Reports used were those for year ending March 2009.
Revenues were collected as provided by the companies and where needed, converted in US

Dollars by using the annual average exchange rate for 2008 between the local currency and US
Dollars, according to data published by the US Federal Reserve (Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, 2009) (please see Appendix D).
Second category of data - where do companies report their CSR activities

To gather information for this second category, the first point of access was again the corporate

web sites. Specific CSR websites as well as companies' Annual Reports were all accessible through the corporate websites. CSR reports, however, and where applicable, were accessible
either from the corporate websites or the specific CSR websites.

In most cases, when information under the heading of "community involvement",
"sustainability", "ethical" etc. was clearly labeled on the web site, the code was "1" in the

corresponding box on "CSR info on the web site". In the case of Endo, for instance, there was a "community involvement" heading on the corporate web site and therefore the code was "1". In

the case of Forest, there was nothing evident on the website, therefore the code shows "0".
Third category of data - CSR activities

This category was the longest and toughest to code, due to the number of fields and therefore
activities to identify, sometimes from various sources {web, CSR report, Annual Report). Priority
was given to dedicated CSR websites and CSR reports when available.

If the information was not clearly identified from these sources, the company's 2008 Annual
Report, and various parts of the general corporate website were explored and information
retrieved from where, if and when available.

From all the above sources, data was collected and coded directly into the spreadsheet (see

Appendix A) between the period of June 14 and July 5, 2009. Although it was relatively straight
58

forward to come by general information and find out how companies report their CSR activities, identifying the actual CSR activities or confirming the lack of CSR activities of each company
was more of a challenge. The lack of information for some companies might indeed only merely reflect the difficulty in accessing the information from a site or a report. In some instances, the research had to be carried out in various places of the web sites. In other instances, some

"digging" had to be done. For instance, in the case of the US based company Eli Lilly, at first, it
looked like there was very little information available. After further investigation, it was found that a lot of information on CSR was only available in their "Red Book", an internal code of

conduct, which had not been identified in the first round of investigation.

6.2.5

Analyzing the data

Once all the data was coded, and given the amount of data collected (83 fields assessed for each

of the 65 companies, making it a total of over 5300 collected data), the conclusion was that it
would not be possible to analyze all the data gathered. Groups had to be defined in order to
identify and extract patterns.

For Hypothesis 2 for instance, companies were grouped according to their size in order to assess if the collected data proved or disproved the hypothesis. Groups of companies within defined

ranges of size were formed. These groups were compared to each other in terms of number of
CSR activities reported, using various tools such as average, standard deviations, scatter plots and correlations. More information is given in part 7.2 of this thesis. Similarly, for Hypothesis 3, three main groups were determined, according the companies' main activity: manufacturers of prescription medicine and OTC products; manufacturers of generics; manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products. Details of the process are given in Part 7.3 of this document.

For the separate purpose of proving or refuting Hypothesis 4, companies were grouped according to their country of origin. Although the 65 companies represented a total of 16 countries, several countries (Australia, Canada, Iceland, India and Israel,) were represented by one or two
companies only. For the analysis, it was therefore decided to focus on companies from Japan, US
59

and the EU (note: Actavis was not included in this group, as Iceland is not part of the EU,

although it has trade agreements with the Union). They were grouped geographically and the
corresponding data analyzed. The three groups were assessed against each other as well as

against a "reference" fourth group, representing all companies. Similarities and differences were
looked for in terms of type of CSR reporting, as well as type of CSR activities.
Overall the tools that were used to analyze the data were averages, standard deviations,

correlations and analysis of variances. As seen in part 7 of this thesis, scatter plots, radar charts,
column charts and pie charts were used to illustrate the findings.

This chapter depicts the methodology used in the thesis. It explains where from and how the data
was collected, and then analyzed. The following chapter analyzes the data that was collected and tries to provide evidence and results in order to address each of the four hypotheses developed in
the previous chapter.

RESULTS: TRENDS IN CSR PRACTICE

The large amount of data gathered allowed for a number of different analyses to be performed, from general to more specific. The aim of the analysis presented in this chapter is to prove or
refute the four hypotheses.

7.1 General observations

General observations were obtained from the data gathered. Although they do not reflect CSR

activities, they are essential for the remainder of the analysis. They reflect the nature of the
sample.

As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the data confirmed that the three major dominant markets are the United States of America, Japan and the European Union, with over 91% of the 65 largest global
companies originating from these three regions.

Another interesting finding, although not linked to CSR but nonetheless important for this study,
was the correlation between the number of employees and the company's revenues. The
correlation was found to be 97% (Figure 5).

Figure 5: Correlation between number of employees and revenues

This was useful for the remainder of the analysis. In two instances, either the revenues or the number of employees could not be accessed. The results in Figure 5, and the associated
calculated correlation, meant that the two companies could still be included in the study, even

with missing data. In the case of Mundipharma, a UK based company, no financial data could be
retrieved and the correlation was used to estimate its revenues. In the case of Procter and Gamble

Pharmaceuticals, the number of employees was not disclosed since P&G does not identify and
calculate the number of persons employed for its pharmaceutical division, as part of the staff

works on a corporate level and not only for the pharmaceutical division. Again, the correlation
was used to estimate the number of employees.

7.2 CSR Reporting: HI

This hypothesis assumed that most pharmaceutical companies practice CSR. To assess the
hypothesis, a conservative test was used, defining "most of as more than two third of the companies (or 66%).

The result that was drawn from the data is that 86% of the 65 studied companies report CSR activities on their corporate website, regardless of their size, their activity, the country which they are from or the regions they operate in. This was found to be significantly higher than the

63

66% mentioned above for the null hypothesis (see Appendix E for details), meaning than most
companies included in this research practice and report CSR activities.

Furthermore, and as shown in Figure 6, it was found that within the group of companies that provide information on CSR activities on their web site, only 7% use their corporate website as the only platform of communication of their CSR activities, while 16% have developed

dedicated CSR websites, 52% publish CSR reports (sometimes under the label of "sustainability
report", or "corporate citizenship report") and 27% choose to report their CSR activities as an
integrated part of their Annual Reports.

Figure 6: Reporting places

Armed with these results, the objective then was to go further into the analysis and try to verify
hypotheses 2, 3 and 4.

7.3 Effect of the size of the company on its CSR reporting: H2

Looking at the effect of the size of the company on the amount of CSR reported was a source of
many potential analyses. In order to find trends and appropriately use the data, the 65 companies
were assembled in 3 groups on the basis of their size (number of employees).

64

The tools that were used to compare each group were average calculations (average number of
reported CSR activities per group of companies), as well as the associated analysis of variance.

The objective was to investigate if, as expected, the number of activities reported was positively
linked to the size of the company.

The first group encompassed the companies with less than 5 000 employees, the second group represented the middle sized companies with 5 000 to 20 000 employees and the last group was
made of the largest organizations with over 20 000 employees. The results are shown in Figure 7

and are corroborated by the results from an Analysis of Variances confirming the significance
between the three groups with p=0,066% (see Appendix F for details of the calculation).

The graph in Figure 7 clearly confirms a link between the size of the company and the amount of
CSR reporting.

Figure 7: Average number of reported CSR activities per number of employees

A further interesting result is the one given in the Figure 8 where all revenues were plotted

against the exact numbers of reported CSR activities, as opposed to average number of
employees and average number of CSR activities per group. A clear logarithmic trend is shown,

65

demonstrating the link between the size of the company (this time in terms of revenues) and the
amount of CSR reported activities.

Both sets of calculations (shown in Figures 7 and 8), whether based on the average number of
employees or the revenues, reflect a positive impact from the size of the company on the number
of CSR activities reported.

7.4 Effect of the type of product on CSR reporting: H3

The original assumption for Hypothesis 3 was that generics companies and biopharmaceutical
companies might not approach responsibility in the same way as prescription drugs companies,
as their business focuses are different.

The objective was to see if there was any trend associated with the type of product manufactured,
i.e. if the fact that a company produced generics or biopharmaceuticals meant that its CSR activities were different to the ones from a company focusing on prescription drugs. Companies were coded with the types of products they manufacture, as described in Chapter 5.2 of this
thesis.

The results obtained by plotting the above companies' average number of CSR activities showed that companies focusing on generics display less activity in terms of CSR (Figure 9). This would be consistent with the fact that the need for CSR activities and reporting might be less demanded since these companies already fill their societal obligation of providing affordable healthcare. The results also showed that companies producing biopharmaceuticals had overall the strongest
focus on CSR.

Figure 9: Average number of CSR activities reported - By type of products

A further breakdown looked at the amount of CSR reporting per category of CSR. Again it
confirmed differences linked to the type of products manufactured (Figure 10).

Overall, generics manufacturers probably do not allocated as high a budget as the other groups of companies do to their CSR activities, as their margins are also smaller. Unsurprisingly, generic manufacturers do not report much activity in terms of product development since they do not

develop proprietary products. A surprising observation was that overall wider discrepancies
existed within the generics sector.

It might have been useful to conduct primary research on these companies to understand their
policies and strategies and better understand the reasons behind the discrepancies.

Figure 10: Differences in CSR focus - per type of products manufactured

In contrast, biopharmaceutical companies demonstrated an average high commitment to CSR, with the lowest standard deviation, thus showing a more constant approach within the group. Their high commitment to drug development related CSR activities is of no surprise since they
are research companies. Their focus on the environment is again not surprising as their processes

require even more stringent control and monitoring than chemical processes in terms of
emissions and especially contamination.

7.5 Effect of the country of origin on CSR reporting: H4

In the last hypothesis, the question to address was whether the country of origin of the company

had or not an impact on the way it approached corporate social responsibility. The assumption was that different cultures might call for different approaches and that since, as seen earlier, regulations have a strong impact on the industry, differences were to be expected when comparing countries with different legal and regulatory approach.

Although a total of 15 countries were represented in the sample of 65 companies, for the sake of

the analysis, only Japan, US and the countries making up the European Union were looked at.
The rationale was that these three main poles represent 91% of all companies looked at in this
69

research, and, as seen earlier in this thesis, have also been designated as the three countries

dominating the global pharmaceutical industry (Aruvian Research, 2009). Other countries
studied in this research were represented by one or two companies each: Australia, Iceland,
Israel, India, Canada.


The first result that was found was that there was no difference at all in the amount of CSR activities reported between US, EU and Japan i.e. a lack of influence of the country on the
amount of CSR reported, and this, regardless of the size of the company. All reported an average

of 24.2 activities out of a possible 46. The standard deviations were also very similar. A single
factor Anova corroborated these findings, by giving a p value of 98% showing that the

differences between the countries in terms of the amount of CSR activities reported were not
significant (see Appendix H for detailed results).

Since no differences were found in the amount of reporting, the next two steps were to look at
the type of reporting and identify if any differences emerged among the three countries. Additionally, it was interesting to evaluate potential difference in terms of the weight given to

certain CSR activities rather than others, in an attempt to illustrate for instance that geography

had an influence on whether social issues were more emphasized than environmental issues.

Figure 11 shows differences in the way countries approach their CSR reporting. While 100% of
Japanese companies report their CSR on their corporate website, no Japanese company has a dedicated CSR website. Meanwhile, 40% of EU companies have a dedicated CSR website, against 12% in US, etc. In terms of documents (i.e. excluding the information provided on web sites), EU companies split their reporting halfway between specific dedicated CSR reports and
their Annual Reports.

The next step was to look at potential differences in terms of CSR focus, first for each category of CSR activity (Drug Development; Patients; Environment and Safety; Social Issues;
Philanthropy; Business Ethics), and second for specific issues within each category.

As shown on Figure 12, overall, the country of origin does not seem to have a major impact on
the companies' reported CSR activities. Very slight differences in the way CSR issues are focused on are found between US, the EU and the global average. Japan, however, displays a slightly different emphasis, specifically in terms of environment and patients.

Figure 12: Differences in CSR focus - per CSR category - per country

Further to these results and in order to identify reasons for these overall differences, it seemed necessary to have a closer look at potential discrepancies within each category. In order to easily
identify discrepancies or major differences in the number of activities communicated, each
71

category was plotted using radar charts. Radar charts were found useful here as they allow for

two observations: overall trends/differences in the relative focus given to each criterion within a
category, and attention given by each country to each criterion.
Drug Developmentfocus
/

No major discrepancies among countries were found within that category since all countries seemed to be splitting their focus in very similar patterns (Figure 13). Japan showed a slightly higher focus than its counterparts on Animal Welfare, and commitment to R&D (92% of
Japanese companies report their commitment to R&D and Innovation, compared to 75% in

European companies and 81% in US companies), which could be explained by the fact that the Japanese companies within the studied sample are mostly focusing on prescription drugs rather than generics and do therefore put strong attention on product development and research.

As seen in Figure 14, the overall consistency observed among countries in terms of R&D is not
repeated in terms of patient focus. Several differences can be spotted, particularly in terms of the
activities reported by Japan compared to the other regions.

72

Japan displays lower focus than other regions on "patient protection against counterfeit", "adapted price policies" as well as "participation in global health programs" and "adapted price policies". Japan, however, displays much higher activity in terms of "education and awareness".

US and Europe display similar overall allocation of focus, with the exception of the participation
in global health programs.

Unsurprisingly, US based companies seem to emphasize reporting their actions in terms of

adapted price policies, which, as seen earlier, is a very important issue within the USA, where in
2007, 18% of the population under the age of 65 had no healthcare insurance coverage (National
Coalition on Healthcare, 2009).
Environmental reporting focus

In terms of environment and as seen in Figure 15, very similar patterns can be seen as far as the
comparative attention given by each country to a particular criterion is concerned.

However, although the pattern is similar, the number of activities differ and Japan displays a much stronger focus on environmental issues than other regions, particularly in terms of 2
criteria: climate change policies and emissions reductions.

Figure 15: CSR Focus within the "Environment" Category
Social issues focus

"Social issues" is a category in which major discrepancies are seen among countries, in terms of
the comparative amount of attention given to each criterion as well as the way different countries
address social issues (Figure 16).

For most criteria, the US and the EU follow a similar approach, except on the questions of "contractor and supplier" criteria which will be discussed at a later stage. Japan, however, does
not reflect so much on its approach to diversity but does concentrate a lot more on senior

employment than other countries do. Two reasons can be found: either Japan focuses more on

senior employment than other countries, due to its aging population or its cultural approach to work, or, in other countries, senior employment is embedded in the companies' diversity
policies.

As far as "HIV/aids non-discrimination workplace policy" is concerned, what was found was
that major EU or US firms which have operations in Africa and which manufacture HIV

medicines are the ones putting emphasis on that criterion.
Philanthropy

Companies' policies or CSR approach to Human Rights seem to be one of the overall listed criteria which displays the most discrepancies among countries. According to Figure 17, Japan again distinguishes itself from the US, the EU and the overall global approach on the criteria listed under philanthropic issues, specifically in terms of human rights and support for research and academic grants for which Japanese countries seem to lead the way, and in terms of access to healthcare which surprisingly does not seen to attract so much
attention in Japan.

Again, one thing to keep in mind is that this thesis reflects the reporting of CSR issues and the
communication used by companies. It does not necessarily reflect the actual CSR activities,
actions and projects.
Business Ethics

In this category, similar patterns can be seen for most of the 14 criteria listed, even if the intensity that countries give to certain topics differs (Figure 18). For the majority of criteria listed under this category, the US displays the stronger focus, probably reflecting strong regulations for disclosure. Executive compensation, financial

disclosure, the need for ethical standards in marketing and sales, and the emphasis on a code of
ethics are all criteria where US based firms display a strong commitment. Surprisingly, risk and crisis management is a point that is emphasized a lot less in the US than it
is in Japan or the EU.

Compliance is a criterion that all countries put a similar emphasis on. This probably reflect the
nature of the industry in which compliance to regulations, standards of quality, and the concept
of good manufacturing practices are omnipresent.

On the other hand, executive compensation is a criterion where major discrepancies are observed, most probably reflecting a cultural factor in terms of disclosure.
Supply Chain

Although this category was not listed in the original research, a last graph on the topic of "supply
chain" was added to the study as the analysis of the data went on.

It seemed indeed that a pattern was emerging on the way supply chain, procurement, suppliers
and contractors were addressed by the various countries. In particular, it seemed that European-

77

based countries were paying stronger attention to their contractors and suppliers than the rest of
the world.

The way to verify the assumption was therefore to extract the data, plot it under one graph and
confirm. Four sets of data were extracted from two categories: the social issue category and the
business ethics category. The results are shown in Figure 19.

Figure 19: CSR Focus in terms of Supply Chain

Figure 19 confirms the impression that Europe is communicating more on its supply chain CSR

activities than other regions. This might be the reflection of the fact that large groups in Europe
outsource their production to Asian countries and that they therefore have to ensure that the
contractors follow the appropriate codes of conducts. Pharmaceutical groups are also

increasingly purchasing their raw materials from Asian countries.

The surprising results came from the fact that US firms do not report spending as much attention
on a responsible supply chain. No explanation could be found as to the reasons for this
observation.

78

Finally, Japan did not report much in terms of their suppliers' adherence to codes of ethics,
respect of labor laws, child labor, etc. The reason here might be that these categories were amalgamated and assimilated under the wider heading of human rights, for which Japan
displayed the strongest focus.

The data analysis undergone and presented in this chapter highlighted a number of trends and focuses, provided evidence of differences and similarities among types of companies, countries
of origin, products manufactured, etc.

The following chapter will discuss if the analysis and the results provided are sufficient to

confirm or refute the four hypotheses. The subsequent chapters will highlight and propose the
potential need for further research.

DISCUSSION: CONVERGENCES AND CONTRADICTIONS - ARE THE
HYPOTHESES CONFIRMED?

Following the materialization, through the analysis, of a number of clear trends, similarities, disparities, contradictions and convergences, the next step of this thesis is to discuss if the four hypotheses formulated in the first half of the thesis based on the literature review as well as on a description of the pharmaceutical industry and its challenges, can or cannot be confirmed.
Each hypothesis will be discussed in a separate section.

8.1 HI: In the pharmaceutical industry, most companies practice and report on Corporate Social Responsibility

The objective of this first part was to prove that the pharmaceutical industry has a specific, dedicated approach to corporate social responsibility. The assumption was that, due to the sheer nature of the industry and its role towards society at large, the pharmaceutical sector is not only
plugged into responsibility and ethics, but its CSR activities and commitments are a mere

extension of its daily activities. Therefore the hypothesis assumed that most companies would act
and report on CSR.

Chapter 4 of this thesis had indeed provided information by listing, grouping and describing a

number of activities that seemed to be very specific to the pharmaceutical sector, tending to show that the CSR activities of pharmaceutical firms are embedded in the companies' approach and
strategy and that therefore most companies would act on CSR almost "as a matter of fact". The methodology that was used to prove or refute this point was based on a content analysis of

company websites, dedicated CSR websites, dedicated CSR reports and Annual Reports. The
information and data looked for were evidence of CSR activities and reporting. The first point of access to the data was the corporate web site for each of the listed companies. The results showed that 86% of the 65 companies displayed evidence of CSR activities which

was found significantly higher than the null hypothesis at 66%. The way and place where they

81

report were however found to differ, from scarce information on their corporate website to
dedicated, very detailed CSR report.

Although the assumption at this stage is that the CSR activities do very much reflect the intrinsic characteristics of the industry and that therefore the industry invests a lot in CSR, further investigation by means of comparative research would be interesting in order to compare the industry with other sectors and find if, within other industries, as seen in the pharmaceutical
industry, the trend is for most of the largest companies to act and report on CSR or not.

Regardless of this observation, since 86% of companies report CSR activities on their websites,
Hypothesis 1 can be fully confirmed. Most companies within the sector, regardless of their size,
their country of origin or the products they manufacture report on CSR.

8.2 H2: The level of reported CSR activities is positively related to the company size It has been proven in the literature that a link exists between the size of a company and its CSR activities. Due to the weight they might have on economy, their role as major employers and the

relatively larger part they might have in the media's attention, larger companies are indeed more
prone to being watched in terms of their actions and activities as responsible companies. They

also have larger resources, staff and time to allocate to a "side" topic like CSR than SMEs might
have.

The pharmaceutical sector is no different from other sectors, it is very diverse in terms of size of
companies, and although the industry has changed tremendously and the major players are now giant firms, there is still a wide variety of available sizes among pharmaceutical companies.

The assumption for drawing Hypothesis 2 was therefore that there would be no reason to think

the pharmaceutical industry would behave differently than other sectors, and hence that there should be a correlation between the size of the pharmaceutical company and its CSR activities.
In order to prove this hypothesis, the method that was chosen was based on a content analysis of company websites, dedicated CSR websites, dedicated CSR reports and Annual Reports. The

CSR in different manners. As expected, less emphasis was put on CSR by generics

manufacturers. On the other hand, biopharmaceuticals manufacturers fully addressed and

covered the potentiality of corporate social responsibilities.
The main issue here is that only a third of the companies were used to gather the data necessary
to prove or refute this hypothesis. Many companies, active in more than one type of products,

had to be excluded from the analysis. A second issue is that the big pharmas were excluded from
the analysis and this fact might have introduced a bias in the research in the sense that, by

excluding the big pharmas, the variety in the size of the companies looked at was considerably

lessen. This might have added a factor of uncertainty and leads to question the acceptability of
the sample.

Hypothesis 3 was therefore proven, only for companies focusing on one type of products only,

and tends to show that in the pharmaceutical sector, the type of products manufactured has an
influence on the company's approach towards CSR.

8.4 H4: The country of origin and the socio-political context influence the
pharmaceutical company's CSR approach

The CSR literature clearly shows a link between the company location, geography, socio political context and the way CSR is approached. Culture has been found to play a role on how
an organization decides to communicate its CSR activities as well as how stakeholders view such
communication (Hartman, Rubin, & Dhanda, 2007).

Based on the above, since the pharmaceutical industry is very much affected by regulatory requirements, government policies, social and political pressures, economic constraints, and

since three main countries (Japan, the EU and US) with very distinct cultures, political and
regulatory environments make up most of the global pharmaceutical market, Hypothesis 4 expected to find differences in the way a company approaches CSR and this, based on its country
of origin.

size or the products they manufacture, address their corporate social responsibility. Hypothesis 4
is therefore proven.

8.5 Summary of discussions

The research conducted in this thesis and the results obtained have helped to identify, highlight and characterize the Corporate Social Responsibility activities and reporting practices of
pharmaceutical firms of various size and structural form on a global basis. Results have shown that overall, the pharmaceutical industry's CSR tend to fit with the CSR
processes, methods and theories described in the literature.

The results obtained from the collection of over 5300 data tend to prove that factors such as the
size of the company, the type of products manufactured as well as the country of origin of the company have an impact on a company's CSR approach, understanding and implementation. The research also seems to tend towards proving that some, if not most, of the observed CSR activities are very specific to the sector, again matching what is described in the literature and proving that the pharmaceutical approach to CSR is very much in line with its activities and its
primary role towards the betterment of human health.

bring about the answers to these unattended questions. It could also mitigate the fact that the lack

of information could in some instance have merely reflected "poor communication" from the studied company, rather than a lack of CSR involvement.
Finally, one of the biggest limitations of this study is the lack of comparative data from other industries and especially when it comes to Hypothesis 1. Although Hypothesis 1 confirms a high

degree of involvement in CSR from the sector, it does not fully confirm that the nature of the
pharmaceutical industry drives that involvement. It does not assess it against other industries either. One approach would be to carry out similar research on various distinct industries and analyze the amount of reporting as well as the differences and similarities in CSR approach
between these industries and the pharmaceutical sector.

Hopefully this research will be helpful in better understanding the pharmaceutical sector, its
constraints, its actors and the way it functions, particularly in terms of its approach of CSR. However, the above reflections on the observed limitations of this thesis ;show that there is still

plenty that could be researched on this vast topic, and many various different angles towards
which further research could be oriented.

10. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The pharmaceutical industry is an industry that is expected to do everything right. It is expected to produce drugs and treatments for diseases and as such is under tight pressure not only to "perform" and provide cures, but also not to "stray" and do anything that could be perceived as "wrong" or unethical. It is expected to invest heavily in research, but yet is criticized when making the profits needed to fund research. It is a sector that is in constant paradox, where the duality between selling and curing is always present and constantly leads to criticism. As eloquently described by H. Tristam Engelhardt Jr (Engelhardt, 2008) "the pursuit of profit in the pharmaceutical industry is for many morally dubious because it is acquired from those who have had the bad fortune of being diseased or disabled". In a few words, the general public put their trust in medicines but expects a lot in return in terms of ethics and socially responsible behavior.
The assumption before starting this thesis was that the industry's raison d'etre (to develop and

provide products to improve human health) could in itself be described as its corporate social responsibility. The aim of this thesis was therefore to take a close look at the sector, address the issues facing the industry, understand the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility, identify
the industry's involvement in CSR, and finally assess the overall importance that pharmaceutical firms place in being socially responsible.

After a review of available academic work on the concept of CSR and a snapshot description of the pharmaceutical industry, its challenges and its business environments, four hypotheses were
drawn based on models and theories available in the literature. The four hypotheses were as
follows:

·

Hypothesis 1: In the pharmaceutical industry, most companies practice and report on Corporate Social Responsibility

·

Hypothesis 2: The level of reported CSR activities is positively related to the company
size.

·

Hypothesis 3: The nature of the products manufactured influences the type of CSR
activities.

·

Hypothesis 4: The country of origin and the socio-political context influence the
pharmaceutical company's CSR approach.
89

The methodology for assessing these hypotheses was based on secondary research, mainly on a content analysis of a variety of documents and communication vehicles publicly available on the web sites of the 65 top pharmaceutical global companies. A total of over 5300 data was collected
and analyzed in order to confirm or refute each of the four hypotheses.

The conclusion was that Hypotheses 2, 3 and 4 were confirmed and therefore matched the models identified in the literature. Factors such as the size of the company, the products
manufactured and the country of origin all have an influence on the company's CSR approach

and on its reporting. As far as Hypothesis 1 is concerned, it was also confirmed, although further
investigation and research, and in particular a comparison with other industries, would be needed to fully pledge that the pharmaceutical sector's high involvement in CSR activities mirrors the
industry's intrinsic characteristics.

The efforts that the sector has put into corporate responsibility will hopefully carry on and will

be further developed and extended. One can only hope thatla constant reminder of the primary
role of the industry and its duty to global health, thanks to the daily realization of CSR activities
at every level within a firm, will continually help the industry find the right balance in addressing

all of its stakeholders' needs and goals, and consolidate the structure of the industry so that all players, from research based companies to generic manufacturers, can work towards achieving a
common goal: making their companies financially sustainable while continuously improving
human health.
