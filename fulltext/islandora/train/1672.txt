SYNTHESIS AND INVESTIGATION OF PERFLUORINATED POLYSTANNANES Master of Science, 2010 Damion Miles Molecular Science Ryerson University

Abstract Two fluorinated tetraaryl stannanes, 1 and 2 were synthesized in good yields. X-ray crystallography revealed deviation from ideal tetrahedral geometry with C-Sn-C bond angles between 107.89°-112.7° for 1 and 104.69°-120.76° for 2. Dichlorides 4 and 5 were synthesized using a redistribution reaction between SnCl4 and 1-2. These dichlorides also deviated from tetrahedral geometry with bond angles between 101.79°-128.44° for 4 and 99.23°-125.9° for 5. Polymerization of 4 and 5 by Wurtz coupling produced polymers 10 and 11. Absolute molecular weights in the range of 1.16 × 105-2.92 × 107 Da was estimated for 10 and 1.47 × 105 Da for 11. UV/VIS spectroscopy gave values of 332 nm and 328 nm that are blue shifted to other polystannanes. The unexpected cleavage of a tin-aryl bond produced tin trihydrides 8 and 9. Polymerization of 8-9 produced the network polymers 12 and 13 with max values of 354 nm and 350 nm.

1.1a History of Synthetic Materials A good indicator of progress in any civilization is the types of materials it creates and uses.1,2 The continuous growth of materials chemistry throughout the ages has given society access to a wide variety of novel synthetic products. Many of these new materials are often stronger, faster, cheaper and perform measurably better than their predecessors.2 These features are some of the main drivers behind materials chemistry, all of which is aimed at making life easier via materials. 1.1b Organic-Carbon Based Chemistry Organic chemistry is based on compounds that contain the elements carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and to a lesser extent silicon, phosphorous and sulfur. While the majority of these elements play an important role in organic chemistry, it is the element carbon that largely defines this field of chemistry.3 The abundance of carbon chemistry is largely due to the relative ease with which carbon forms bonds with itself and other heteroatoms.3 1.1c Application of Carbon Chemistry and Group 14 Elements By modifying carbon based compounds, materials with tailored properties can be obtained. This can be achieved by incorporating elements of the periodic table that possess a wide variety of properties. Some elements possess similar properties (notably those in the same group), while others differ dramatically.4 The Group 14 elements Si, Ge, Sn and to a lesser extent Pb mainly due its size are expected to have similar chemistry and properties.4 Overall, only a small percentage of elements in the periodic table and the compounds that they can form have been investigated for their properties.

1.1d Organic Based Polymers and Their Applications Polymers are long chain, usually linear compounds that are connected by elements forming covalent bonds ( or ) in what is referred to as the backbone of the polymer.1,2 This backbone is often highlighted by the repetition of one or more monomeric units forming a chain like structure.1,2 The length of these chains along with the substituents in the backbone are often responsible for dictating the properties of polymers.1,2 Many of the best studied and characterized polymers are those based upon a carbon backbone. While this continues to hold true, the polymer chemistry of elements other than carbon are now being actively investigated. These inorganic and organometallic polymers may possess improved thermal and chemical stabilities, along with novel electronic properties.1,2 Synthetic polymers have found many uses ranging from everyday materials such as elastomers and thermoplastics to more technological uses in electrical, optical and biological systems.5 A sampling of polymers and their applications are listed in Table 1.

1.2a Conducting Polymers and the Band Gap Theory Conducting polymers are a class of polymers that have the ability to conduct an electrical charge, usually along their backbone. These type of polymers have backbones that are normally comprised of a metal, metalloid1 or a fully conjugated  system.9-12,13,14 They are generally referred to as semi-conductors because their conductivity lies between those of an insulator and a conductor (metal).10,11 Conductive polymers uniquely combine the mechanical properties of modern plastic with the ability to conduct electricity like a metal or metalloid.10 The electrical properties of conducting polymers can be accurately described using band gap theory.12 Band gap theory is an extension of the molecular orbital theory which states that the number of molecular orbitals is equal to the number of atomic orbitals that combines to form the molecule. There is an increase in the number of atomic orbitals in the case of polymers due to the number of repeating units in their backbone and this causes the gap between these molecular orbitals to decrease.12 The resulting overlapping molecular orbitals are closer in energy causing them to appear as a band on an energy diagram.12 This also results in a reduction of distance between the HOMO (filled or partially filled valence band) and LUMO (empty conduction band) orbitals which is known as the band gap. This is significant because in order for conduction to occur, electrons in the valence band must absorb enough energy to be promoted to the conduction band.13 The smaller the band gap, the lower the energy that is required to promote electrons and the better conductor the material will be. Figure 1 is a schematic band gap diagram describing the different types of conducting materials.12

Figure 1: Electronic band gap of an insulator, semi-conductor, and conductor.12 Most metals characteristically have large radii when compared to other main group elements on the periodic table and as a result the outermost electrons are only weakly held.18 These electrons have the ability to delocalize more freely than those in non-metallic systems.18 The mobility of these electrons are also enhanced by the fact that metals intrinsically have no band gap due a overlap between the valence and conduction band as seen in Figure 1.12 While conductors and semi-conductors have the ability to conduct electricity, there is a third class of material known as insulators that lack the ability to conduct charge due to a large band gap. These are often organic molecules that lack a  conjugated system and have saturated carbon backbones. 1.2b Organic  Conjugated Conducting Polymers Conducting polymers were first synthesized and characterized by Pohl13 and Katon14 who in the 1960's highlighted the electrical behaviour of some  conjugated polymers. While these were not the first reports of electrically conducting polymers, they represent the first in-depth study of the electrical behaviour of 5

polymers. Their research was instrumental, but it wasn't until 1977 that the first highly conducting polymers were reported.9 Shirikawa and Heeger demonstrated the conductivity of a silvery film of the polymer transpolyacetylene increased dramatically when it was doped by exposing it to halogens vapours, in particular iodine's.9,10 This conductive behaviour was also evident in other  conjugated polymers, some of which are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Some of the earliest well known organic conducting polymers.9 A comparison of the conductivity of a few organic polymers is illustrated in Figure 3. The diagram shows that at low doping concentrations, organic polymers such as polyacetylene are insulators or semi-conductors but can achieve the conductivities of metals upon doping.15 In the example of n-type doping, electrons from the electron rich dopant are injected into the conduction band. Conduction is then achieved by the

application of a voltage (energy) that allows these electrons to become mobile. The polymers highlighted in Figure 3 are fully conjugated, allowing electrons to delocalize along their backbone via their  system.15

6

Figure 3: Conductivity of some organic polymer before and after doping15 This is because electrons in  bonds are higher in energy which brings them closer to the LUMO orbital. This feature allows these  electrons to achieve the mobility required for conduction upon doping.12,16 1.3a Group 14 Inorganic Polymers A logical place to look for inorganic main group element based polymers is in Group 14 of the periodic table where the elements are expected to have properties that resemble those of carbon.4 The similarity in chemistry should allow these heavier Group 14 elements to form polymers with similar architecture to those formed by carbon.17 While organic polymers can only conduct along a conjugated  system along their backbone, this is not the case in organometallic polymers.1,2 The electrons in a metal or metalloid  bond are generally higher in energy than those in a carbon based  system.18 As shown in Figure 4, the band gap of the elements decrease moving downwards in the group.17 7

Figure 4: The band gap of the first 5 elements of the Group 14. This gives metals and semi-metals the ability to conduct electricity along their sigma bond, something not observed in organic polymers.1,2,9 Previous research has shown that Group 14 metal and metalloid (Si, Ge, Sn) polymers display interesting electronic properties.1,2,19 Because of their intrinsic semi-conducting properties, metal containing polymers like polystannanes tend to have lower band gaps compared to their organic counterparts.19-21 This is evident in that organic polymers usually require a higher degree of doping to achieve comparable conductivity to inorganic polymers.11 It is also based on theoretical calculations that suggest that polystannane may be able to achieve a metallic state whereby the valence and the conduction band overlap.19 Theoretically it is believed that this can be achieved by influencing the backbone conformation and bond angles. Calculations using the Sandorfy C model make the assumption that polystannanes are linear chains of Sn atoms with interacting sp3 orbitals.20 In this model, the ratio of the resonance integral  of the germinal and vicinal interaction (gem/vic) is used to determine the degree of delocalization along the backbone of the polymers.21 When this value approaches unity, the orbital 8

interaction between each atom and its neighbour is similar to interactions found within the atom itself which suggest that there is considerable delocalization along the backbone.21 A value of 0.75 was calculated for polystannanes revealing a high degree of interaction between neighbouring orbitals.21 Therefore polystannanes are expected to be fully conjugated with the ability to conduct along their sigma bond. Table 2 lists some Group 14 polymers and their corresponding conformation dependant calculated band gaps. Based on these studies, polystannanes with trans-planar backbones are expected to be more conjugated as compared to their non-planar counterparts. This is due to the increased orbital interactions as a result of having the correct orientation.21 Table 2: Calculated band parameter for polystannane and other Group 14 elements21 Polymer (CH2)n [CH=CH]n [SiH2]n Conformation Trans-planar Trans-planar Trans-planar Gauche helical [GeH2]n Trans-planar Gauche helical [SnH2]n Trans-planar Gauche helical Band gap Eg (eV) 3.89 5.94 3.31 5.13 2.80 4.65 Effective hole mass at valence band edge 0.21 0.12 0.14 7.84 0.13 5.39 0.12 9.66 Effective electron mass at conduction band edge 0.10 0.88 0.10 0.57 0.09 2.32

1.3b Synthetic History of Polystannane Tin is the only heavy metal known to form a polymer whereby the backbone is completely comprised of metal atoms.22 Like carbon, tin forms four covalent bonds and a linear chain with an extended Sn-Sn backbone. These type of polymers are referred to as polystannanes. While the first examples of high 9

molecular weight polystannanes have only been isolated in the last two decades, organotin compounds have been known for some time. They were first discovered in the 19th century by Farkland who in 1848 was able to isolate diethyltin diiodide from a reaction between tin metal and ethyl iodide (Rxn. 1).23
2 EtI + Sn Et2SnI2 (1)

He followed up this work by isolating diethyltin in 1852/53 from a reaction that involved the immersion of zinc foil into a solution of diethyltin dichloride, but this was later disputed based on the elemental analysis reported.24 Oligo-and polystannanes were isolated by Löwig in 1852 from a reaction between Sn/K (or Sn/Na) alloy and iodoethane.24 Löwig, using diethyl ether and ethanol as the reaction and recovery solvent, was able to isolate compounds that gave elemental analysis consistent with a structure for oligo and poly(diethyl)stannanes ([Et2Sn]n). These compounds were described as viscous liquids. The liquid nature of these compounds was more consistent with smaller molecules and it was later hypothesized that this liquid was due to the presence of cyclic oligomers that resulted from the degradation of [Et2Sn]n. A recent resurgence of interest in polystannanes was stimulated by work done by Dräger and coworkers on model oligostannanes in the late 1980's.25,26 This critical work bridged the understanding between pure metallic and organometallic tin compounds. Dräger investigated the structure of organotin compounds as they transition from compounds with a simple - bond to those with extensive delocalized character. He was able to use a variety of techniques such as X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic techniques such as IR, UV/VIS and NMR to characterize the molecular and electronic structure of oligostannanes. X-ray studies revealed that bond angles of oligostannanes deviated significantly from an ideal tetrahedral geometry. These angles were found to increase as result of the Sn-Sn bonds substantially lengthening with catenation. It was suggested that this was a clear indicator of a decreasing band gap. These two trends were further exaggerated by the introduction of bulky electron rich substituent at the Sn center25 as illustrated by Figure 5. 10

Figure 5: Structures and structural data showing bond angles and length of organotin compounds of different chain length.26 Dräger also investigated the electronic and structural properties of polystannanes by using
119

Sn-NMR to

study the effect of substituent and structural conformation on NMR chemical shifts. It was reported that for shorter chains an increase in the number of tin atoms resulted in a decrease in the 119Sn-NMR shift.25,26 This trend was reversed in longer chain polystannanes whereby an increase in the number of heavy elements in the chain lead to a positive increase in NMR shift. Results of some of the electronic studies done by Dräger are illustrated in Figure 6.25 He effectively demonstrated that the chemical shift of any polystannane was a combination of its structural (coordination number, steric bulk, and geometry) and electronic properties (electron withdrawing vs. electron donating groups).

11

Figure 6: Relationship between structure and NMR shift25 Studies were also carried out using UV/VIS spectroscopy to decipher the relationship between the chromophoric behaviour and the level of catenation in polystannanes. Figure 7 identifies a direct relationship between the absorption wavelength, NMR shift and the level catenation for linear polystannanes.25 Dräger also reported that five and six membered oligostannane rings were blue shifted compared to their linear counterparts. He attributed this to their geometry being less than ideal for orbital interactions; these structures deviate from planarity that is necessary for better interactions.

Building upon the groundbreaking work of Dräger, Sita et al. re-investigated model oligostannanes using the hydrostannolysis reaction above.27 This reaction had been used in literature for the synthesis of tri and tetrastannanes. In order to synthesize a higher order chain, a slight modification of the process involving the use of a -alkoxy group was employed.27 They were able to confirm that oligostannanes with up to 16 repeating units in their backbone (n > 16) underwent a bathochromic shift upon catenation which had 13

previously been assumed based on the yellow color of diphenyl tin from earlier studies.27 These findings were in good agreement with the predicted band gap theory. 1.3c Current Methods for the Synthesis of Polystannanes and other Group 14 Elements Currently there are three main reductive coupling methods that can be used to synthesize polymers of Group 14 elements, including polystannanes. These synthetic methodologies are Wurtz coupling,31,35 electrochemical coupling36 and dehydrocoupling reactions. 21,22,24 1.3d Wurtz Coupling of Polystannanes The Wurtz coupling methods are similar to the earlier reports by Löwig in his synthesis of polystannanes whereby he reacted iodoethane in the presence of Sn/Na (or Sn/K) alloy.24 Wurtz coupling was first discovered as an effecient method to form carbon-carbon bonds from the reaction of alkyl halides with Na (rxn 3).28,29 It was later discovered that this reaction could also be applied to other Group 14 elements.31

Kipping first investigated the Wurtz coupling of dichlorosilanes to produce silane oligomers with siliconsilicon bonds in their backbone.30 This type of reaction typically involves the reaction of a dichloride species in the presence of sodium metal in a high boiling solvent such as toluene.31,35 The Wurtz coupling of dichlorostannanes was modeled on work conducted using chlorogermane and chlorosilanes monomers.1 The first report of the Kipping method being used to prepare a polystannane was by Zou et al.31 in 1992. Poly(dibutylstannane), [(nBu)2Sn]n, was prepared from the corresponding dichlorostannane,31 (nBu2SnCl2), using a Wurtz type method with a reported molecular weight in the ~106 Da range. This represented the first isolation of a high molecular weight polystannane.

While this reaction (Rxn 4 above) was successfully used to synthesize high molecular weight polystannanes, there are several drawbacks. The amount of undesirable cyclic oligomers produced from these types of reactions leads to a low recovery of high molecular weight fractions.32 This synthetic approach results in a polymodal distribution of the molecular weights which is likely caused by end-biting and back-biting during the propagation stage of these radically initiated reactions.33 More recently, a slight modification of the Wurtz coupling reaction has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the amount of cyclic oligomers produced. This modification involves lowering the reaction temperature from ~100°C to 60oC and utilizing finely dispersed sodium in toluene. Reactions were also carried out in the presence of crown ether that is known to complex sodium ions.34 The introduction of crown ethers into a Wurtz type reaction was first reported by Fujino et al.34 An increased rate of polymerization was observed when 18-crown-6-ether was used in the Wurtz coupling of silane dichloride monomers. This was attributed to an increase in the reactivity of the silyl anion due to the formation of crown-ether sodium complex.34 These reactions also lead to an improvement in the polydispersity of the polymers as shown by Figure 8.34 More recently reactions using a 15-crown-5-ether have resulted in polymers with average molecular weights in the 106 Da range which was estimated by GPC using an RI detector.35 These reactions were also found to be highly dependent on the reaction time with longer times producing a higher fraction of cyclic due to the end and back-biting previous mentioned.35

1.3e Electrochemical Synthesis of Polystannane Polystannanes have also been synthesized using electrochemical methods. Okano and co-workers synthesized a series of dialkyl substituted polystannanes. This was carried out using a platinum cathode and silver anode along with constant voltage (20V) to drive the polymerization as shown below (Rxn 5).36

These polymers readily precipitated from solution and were isolated after the completion of electrolysis. The molecular weights obtained using this method were in the ~104 Da range; similar to the electrochemically prepared (n-Bu2Ge)n and (n-Bu2Si)n polymers.36 UV/VIS spectroscopy was used to investigate the properties of the electrochemically prepared polystannanes. It was observed that the absorption max (max, > 378-381 nm) values were comparable to those of other poly(dialkyl)stannane prepared using alternate methods.24 16

Okano also investigated the moisture and air stability of polystannanes. He demonstrated that these types of polymers are stable to the presence of oxygen, contrary to previously published reports.36 On the other hand, polystannanes were found to be sensitive to moisture and light as evident by their rapid depolymerisation after exposure. A similar electropolymerization technique was also used in the preparation of 3-D network polymers with silane (polysilynes), germane (polygermynes) and stannane (polystannynes) backbones.37 The polymers were synthesized from trichloride monomers (Rxn 6).38

Using UV/VIS spectroscopy, Okano was able to confirm the 3-D nature of these polymers. The UV/VIS spectrum showed no obvious single absorption peak, a characteristic of network polymers.37 The UV/VIS spectrum of these network polymers also possess unusually long absorption tail that extends well into the near IR (> 850 nm). This is due to their extensive 3-D -conjugated system. Compared to these network Group 14 polymers, linear poly(dialkyl)stannanes are considerably blue shifted with a distinct broad absorption between 340-500 nm. 1.3f One Electron Coupling of Polystannane Using Samarium Iodide A chemical method for the synthesis of polystannane is the reductive coupling of tin dichlorides using SmI2 as the coupling agent. SmI2 is a strong one electron reducing agent (1.55 V vs. saturated calomel electrode)
38

that, unlike many inorganic reducing agents, is soluble in wide range polar of solvents. The reaction of

SmI2 can be placed into three different categories when it pertains to polymerization.39 The first category involves inversion of a cationic growth center into one that is anionic. The second category is the polymerization of electrophilic vinyl monomers that are bisinitiated by the electron transfer from Sm and the 17

last category involves the extension of a carbon-carbon (or Sn-Sn) bond forming reaction into stepwise growth polymerization.39 The application of SmI2 to the formation of Sn-Sn bond was investigated by Mochida and co-workers in 1998 using tin dichloride monomers (Rxn 7).40
R RSnCl2 SmI2/HMPA-THF * Sn R R = Alkyl n * (7)

Mochida explored the synthesis of polystannanes under mild conditions using SmI2 and investigated their photostability when exposed to a laser flash. The yields obtained using this method ranged from as high as 74.4% to a low of 5.8% with average molecular weight in the ~103 Da range.40 In general, these values were below those obtained using other preparative methods for polystannanes.21,22,24 Mochida investigated polystannanes bearing alkyl substituent (Me, Et, Hex) and found that their electronic absorption ranged from 285-368 nm. The lack of light stability of these polymers was evaluated by irradiating the samples with UV and it was determined that the chain lengths decreased due to scission by light.40 1.3g Dehydrocoupling of Tin Dihydrides A more recent technique for the synthesis of polystannane is the dehydrocoupling reaction of secondary stannanes using a metal catalyzed chain growth reaction.41 This involves the reaction of a tin dihydride in the presence of a metal catalyst, forming Sn-Sn bonds with the evolution of hydrogen gas. The proposed mechanism for dehydrocoupling is illustrated below.21

18

Figure 9: Mechanism for metal catalyzed dehydrocoupling of polystannanes21 Dehydrocoupling of Group 14 hydrides was first investigated by Harrod in the 1980's.42 He successfully dehydropolymerized PhSiH3 and PhGeH3 in the presence of a titanium based catalyst to form low molecular weight oligomers. While dehydrocoupling has been successful for primary silanes and germanes, it has been less successful for the corresponding secondary systems. Currently, there has been no report of the dehydrocoupling of secondary germanes or silanes to yield high molecular weight polymer. Harrod reported that the dehydropolymerization of the germanium hydrides was easier compared to their silane counterparts.43 Based on these findings, it was postulated that the ease of dehydrocoupling increases going downward in a group.43 It is expected that tin hydrides should undergo dehydrocoupling more readily than their silicon and germanium counterparts.43 More recent kinetic studies on the dehydrocoupling of secondary silanes to dimers or oligomers was recently investigated by Rosenberg and co-worker.44 They observed that an open system was required to allow for the release of hydrogen gas in order for the reactions to progress to 19

completion.44 In 1993 Tilley demonstrated that nBu2SnH2 readily undergoes dehydrocoupling in the presence of the zirconocene based catalyst, [Zr(-C5H5)(-C5Me5){Si(SiMe3)3Me], to form [(nBu)2Sn]n and oligostannanes, along with the evolution of H2 gas (Rxn 8). This was the first report of dehydrocoupling for the synthesis of polystannanes.41

Tilley reported that these systems produced cyclic oligomers similar to those formed from the Wurtz coupling polymerization of silanes. This catalytically driven dehydrocoupling has been carried out in the presence of various transition metal catalysts including Rh, Pt, Ni and Zr.41,45,22,24 Table 3 details representative molecular weights and absorption maximum (max) of polystannanes along with the catalysts used in their preparation.

More recent work on polystannanes has been carried out by Caseri et al. who also used dehydrocoupling to synthesize high molecular weight poly(dialkyl)stannanes.48 Using a series of different metal catalysts Caseri demonstrated the effectiveness of Wilkinson's catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3, normally used in hydrogenation reactions,21,48 for dehydrocoupling. Reactions utilizing this catalyst yielded high molecular weight polymers with no detectable cyclic oligomers. This catalyst was found to be sensitive to steric bulk at the tin center and was therefore less efficient for monomers with bulky or aryl groups directly attached to the tin. Caseri et al. reported that in order for this catalyst to be applicable for polystannanes with bulky side groups, there had to a minimum of two methylene (-CH2-) units between the tin atom and the bulky substituent.21,48 1.3h Electronic Properties of Polystannanes Using UV/VIS spectroscopy, Sita27, Caseri24 and Tilley41 were able to study the band gap trends of polystannane polymers. The visible absorption in these polymers are attributed to the -* transition of the conjugated backbone. Poly(dialkyl)stannanes were typically 40 nm red shifted compared to their silane analogs while poly(diaryl)stannanes were 70 nm redshifted to their silane analogs.46,47,41 The poly(diaryl)stannanes were reported to absorb at longer wavelengths than poly(dialkyl)stannane due to the  mixing from the phenyl rings.47 Tilley was also able to show that the bandgap of these polymers was highly influenced by the backbone conformation and the electronic properties of the substituents. Poly(diaryl)stannanes with a planar zig zag backbone and  donating ring substituents were found to possess the lowest band gap for any known for polystannanes (max = 550 nm, corresponding to a band gap of ca. 2.3 eV).48 Theoretically it has been suggested that the band gap of polystannanes could approach that of metals.21 By comparision band gap for most polysilanes are in the 4 eV range.50 This is still considerably smaller than the band gap for polymers with saturated carbon skeletons; these typical have band gaps of ~8 eV.51 21

West et al. reported that phenylmethylpolysilanes doped with AsF5 were able to achieve conductivity of 0.5 Scm-I.52 More recently Caseri et al. showed that [n-Bu2Sn]n are liquid crystals at room temperature, a property that may yet highlight a future use. They reported a charge mobility between 0.1 cm2 V-1 s-1-0.03 cm2 V-1 s-1 for this particular polymer depending on the temperature.53 Tilley described conductivities between 0.1 and 0.3 Scm-1 for [n-Bu2Sn]n when oxidatively doped with SbF5.54 1.4a NMR spectroscopy Techniques such as NMR spectroscopy have proven to be instrumental in the characterization of polystannanes. In particular,
119

Sn-NMR spectroscopy can be used to investigate the structure and chain

length of these polymers. It was observed that as chain length of oligostannanes increased, it caused a substantial downfield shift in the
119

Sn-NMR signal. NMR can also be used to provide insight to the
119

electronic structure of stannanes.25,26 Both Caseri45 and Tilley41 successfully showed that

Sn-NMR

spectroscopy in conjunction with other methods such as UV-VIS absorption data was instrumental in determining the structure of polystannanes synthesized in their work. They were able to differentiate between linear and cyclic species for [nBu2Sn]n using
119

Sn-NMR (-189.6 ppm vs. -200.9 ppm).24 Table 4

1.4b Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) to determine molecular weight Another technique often used to characterize polymers based on their size is Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). In GPC, polymer molecular weights are determined by comparison to a series of standards of known molecular weight and structure. Molecular weights are determined by measuring properties such as the refractive index, viscosity, UV absorption, light scattering and retention time. The absolute molecular weight of polymers can be calculated using GPC's that are equipped with light scattering, refractive index and intrinsic viscosity detectors. All polystannanes isolated to date had their molecular weights determined by GPC. This was carried out using RI detectors and referenced relative to polystyrene standards with THF as the mobile phase.47,31,24 GPC was used in the molecular weight determination for polymers synthesized by Zou31, Caseri42and Okano36 who all prepared polystannanes using different methods. The molecular weight determined by GPC from each method is listed in the Table 5. Table 5: GPC results from the different methods for polystannane synthesis Polymer [nBu2Sn]n [nBu2Sn]n [nBu2Sn]n [Me2Sn]n Method of Synthesisref Wurtz coupling35 Dehydrocoupling42 Electrochemistry36 Samarium iodide40 Molecular weight (Da) and (PDI) 1.2 × 106 (1.3) 2.0 × 104 (3.3) 1.2 × 104 (2.1) 1.1 × 103 (1.49)

GPC has proven to be instrumental not only in the determination of molecular weights of polystannanes but also to investigate the stability of these polymers under different condition. Polystannanes have been found to breakdown to cyclic oligomers under exposure to light or solvent and this degradation can be detected using GPC.24,41

1.4c Thermal Analysis: Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)

The thermal stability of polymers can be accurately assessed using methods such as thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). In this method, polymers are heated slowly and controllably to determine their stability at different temperatures by measuring the mass loss. Previous studies of polystannanes using TGA analysis revealed stability up to relatively high temperatures (> 300°C). The majority of polystannanes do not begin to experience mass loss until temperatures of 250°C-310°C24,46 in the case of poly(diaryl)stannanes and 180320°C for poly(dialkyl)stannanes.46 Table 6 shows the temperature of decomposition for selected poly(diaryl)-and poly(dialkyl)stannanes.

These inorganic polymers are much more stable than their organic counterparts which is often highlighted as one of the possible advantages of inorganic polymers.1,2 A non-destructive thermal analysis also used to detect phase changes associated with polymers such as glass transition (Tg), crystallization (Tc) and melting temperature (Tm) is DSC (differential scanning calorometry). In DSC the polymers are heated and cooled over a wide range of temperatures while the enthalpy (heat) change in the sample is being monitored. Figure 10 shows the DSC graph for [(nBu)2Sn]n, which reveals its

24

liquid crystalline nature at room temperature.53 Table 7 gives some phase transition temperatures for polystannanes from literature using DSC.

1.5a Properties of Fluorinated Compound Flourine is the most electronegative atom on the periodic table and it is also one of the smallest. Because of these two properties, the fluorine carbon bond is one of the strongest known in chemistry.55 The electron withdrawing capacity of flourine has also been shown to increase the strength of carbon-carbon bond. This is evident in hexafluoroethane where the C-C bonds are 7 kcal/mol stronger than those in ethane.56 In this case electron density around the carbon nucleus is reduced due to the presence of the electron withdrawing fluorine. This feature allows the two atoms to come in close to each other resulting in stronger bonds. These fluorocarbons also have low polarizability which causes a lack of cohesive attractions which is normally present in their hydrocarbon counterparts such as London forces.56 It is suggested that the amount of cohesive force increases with the square of the polarizability of the compound.56 Table 8 shows the effect of fluorine on the dipole moment of molecules. Table 8: Effect of fluorine on the dipole moment of molecules57 Compound Dipole Moment (Debye) CH3F CH2F2 Fluorobenzene 1.85 1.97 1.70

The properties of the C-F bond can also extend to the carbon framework of fluorinated compounds which results in an overall increase in hydrophobicity.57 These fluorocarbon compounds have properties that differ dramatically from their hydrocarbon counterparts such as high thermal stability, etc. Substituents with perfluorinated groups have been utilized frequently as moisture repellent due to the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated.57

26

1.5b Fluorinated Tin Compounds Tetraphenyl tin derivatives with fluorinated side groups were prepared from the reaction between tin (IV) chloride and the corresponding Grignard reagent by King et al. as shown below (Rxn 9).59
SnCl4 + 4 RMgBr R = Fluorinated phenyl R4Sn (9)

They were able to characterize the structure of these compounds using 13C-NMR, 19F-NMR and 119Sn-NMR. This was followed by the synthesis of tris-and bisphenyl substituted tin chlorides using the redistribution reaction below. In this reaction the tetraphenyltin derivatives and tin (IV) chloride are reacted together in the neat at high temperature (Rxn 10).
SnCl4 + R4Sn R2SnCl2 + R3SnCl (10)

The investigation of fluorinated tin compounds was also carried out by Stern et al. who synthesized fluorinated tin hydrides using steps similar to those employed by King et al.59,60 They reported difficulties carrying out redistribution reactions with SnCl4 when electron withdrawing groups were in the meta position of the phenyl ring.60 This was attributed to the similarities between these reactions and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Tin hydrides with fluorinated subsituents were synthesized by Stern et al. by substitution of chlorine using the hydride nucleophile, LiAlH460 (Rxn 11)
LiALH4 + R3SnCl R3SnCl

In their preparation of triaryltin hydrides, Stern and Becker encountered problems when electronwithdrawing groups were located in the para position.60 They reported a considerable amount of the unwanted distannane being formed along with the desired product. It was argued that the presence of 27

electron withdrawing groups lead to cleavage of the newly formed hydride bond or even the tin-aryl bond by the various nucleophiles present in solution.60 Cleavage of the tin-aryl bond was confirmed by the isolation of free phenyl substituents.60 These steps have been successfully used in numerous examples in literature to synthesize dialkyl and diaryl tin dihydrides.41,46 1.6a Thesis Objective While polystannanes show tremendous potential based on their electronic properties, their utility is limited by inherent instability to both moisture and light. This research will focus on stabilizing polystannanes to moisture with the hope that this work can be combined with other synthetic strategies that also addresses the need for improve light stability. The goal is to synthesize a series of fluorinated tin compounds and investigate their properties and stability. Introduction of perfluorinated groups into the backbone of

polystannanes may increase their overall moisture stability. Figure 11 illustrates some of the perfluorinated groups that will be investigated.

Figure 12: Steps for the synthesis of polymers using Wurtz coupling or dehydrocoupling reactions Figure 12 illustrates the steps that will be used to synthesize polystannanes in this research, where R represents fluorinated side groups in Figure 11. Initially a series of tetra aryl stannanes will be synthesized using either a Grignard or organolithium route. This will be accomplished by a substitution reaction between SnCl4 and the corresponding Grignard or organolithium reagent. The next step involves the synthesis of tin 29

dichlorides by a redistribution reaction between SnCl4 and the tetraaryl stannanes prepared. These dichlorides will then be employed as monomers using a modified Wurtz coupling reaction. In this method, dichloride monomers are reacted in the presence of sodium metal and a crown ether. Alternatively, tin dihydrides can be synthesized from tin dichlorides by substitution of the chlorine atoms using a hydride nucleophile such as LiAlH4. These tin dihydrides can then be used as monomers for dehydrocoupling in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst. Characterization of the polymers and products mentioned above will be carried out techniques such as X-ray crystallography, GPC, elemental analysis, and NMR and UV/VIS spectroscopy. Once characterized these fluorinated compounds will be compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts with respect to their stability and electronic properties.

The isotopic distributions that were calculated agreed well with experimental values. Elemental Analysis was performed by Analest laboratories at the University of Toronto. Molecular weights of polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Viscotek Triple Model 302 Detector system equipped with a Refractive Index Detector (RI), a four capillary differential viscometer (VISC), a right angle laser light scattering detector (0 = 670 nm) and a low angle laser light scattering detector. GPC columns were calibrated versus polystyrene standards (American Polymer Standards). ACS grade THF was used as the mobile phase with a constant flow rate of 1ml/min. All experiments were performed under inert atmosphere conditions (N2) using Schlenk techniques. Bruker-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer was used to collect the X-ray information crystal structure obtained in this experiment. This machine is equipped with monochromated Mo-K radiation source and samples were measured using a combination of  scans and  scans with  offsets, in order to fill the Ewald sphere. The structure was resolved and refined using 31

SHELXTL V6.1 for full-matrix least-squares refinement that was based on F2. All H atoms were included in calculated positions and allowed to refine in riding-motion approximation with U~iso~ tied to the carrier atom.

In a separate 250 mL schlenk flask, 4.2 mL (4.2 mmol) of 1M LiAlH4 was added to a 50 mL ether solution and allowed to cool to 0°C in an ice bath. Using a double tipped canula, the solution containing the dichloride monomer 4 was added dropwise to the LiAlH4 solution over a 30 minute period resulting in the formation of a white precipitate. The reaction was then removed from the ice bath and stirred at room temperature for an additional 2h. The reaction was quenched by the slow addition of cold degassed water until the liberation of hydrogen gas was no longer evident. Addition of water also resulted in the formation of a slight yellow color. The mixture was poured into a 250 mL separatory funnel followed by extraction to separate the aqueous layer from the slightly yellow organic layer. The aqueous layer was discarded and the ether layer placed over a drying agent (CaCl2) for 2 h to remove any remaining moisture. 40

3.0 Results and Discussion 3.1 Fluorinated Tetraaryl Tin Compounds The preparation of tetrakis fluorinated phenyl tin precursors (4 and 5) was successfully carried using both the Grignard and organolithium routes. The Grignard reaction was more time consuming as this reaction required overnight refluxing while the two step lithium route required only 4 h to reach completion. The organolithium route is also superior in terms of the percent yield (> 70%) when compared to the Grignard route (< 44%) for compound 2. The organolithium route was therefore chosen for all subsequent reactions. The clear white product obtained after sublimation was investigated using NMR spectroscopy (19F-NMR,
119

Sn-NMR,

13

C-NMR and 1H-NMR). The

119

Sn-NMR shift observed for 1 and 2 are comparable to those

reported by King et al.59 for the same compounds as shown by Table 9. Table 9: Comparison of experimental and literature 119Sn-NMR shift for 1 and 2 Compound Experimental 119Sn-NMR  (ppm) Literature59 119Sn-NMR  (ppm) 1 2 131.0 126.1 132.3 128.1

The para disubstituted ring subsituents of compound 1 are expected to give rise to a AA'BB' 1H-NMR pattern.62 However this was not the case as only a singlet at 7.7 ppm was observed ( Figure 26). The two proton environments found in the structure of 1 are considered to be chemically different but magnetically equivalent therefore giving rise to a single peak. Compound 2 gave the expected ABA pattern with a 2/1 ratio for a 1,3,5 trisubstituted phenyl ring (Figure 26).

47

Figure 26: A plot of the 1H-NMR spectra for compounds 1-2 and 4-5 X-ray analysis was also used to characterize the structure of one of the fluorinated tetraaryl stannanes. Compound 2 showed Sn-C bond lengths of (2.149 Å) that were very similar to those of tetraphenyl tin63 (2.144 Å) and other similar compounds. However, 2 deviates dramatically from ideal tetrahedral compared tetraphenyl tin where all angles at the central tin atom are nearly ideal (109.5°±1°). With C-Sn-C bond angles between 104.69°-120.76° compound 2 can best be described as having a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Such deviations indicate that the introduction of the CF3 groups is having steric and/or electronic effect on the structure of these compounds.

48

Figure 27: Crystal structure for compound 264 The X-ray structure for 2 is shown in Figure 27.64 Based on the close proximity of the CF3 groups, it is evident that steric crowding impacts the geometry of this compound. These electron rich CF3 groups also lead to extensive electronic repulsion with neighbouring CF3 groups. While distortion of the bond angles is evident in the analogous non fluorinated compounds (3,5(CH3)C6H3)4Sn65 and (3,5(Cl)C6H3)4Sn,66 it is much less compared to 2. In the case of 1, the literature shows that bond angles around the central tin atom are between 107.89°-112.9°.67 The para position of the single CF3 group in 1 allows this structure to have less hindrance between substituents unlike 2 where the CF3 groups are in close proximity. The lone CF3 on each ring in 1 is also expected have a lesser electronic effect compared to compound 2. These compounds were also characterized using time of flight mass spectroscopy (TOF-MS) as way to determine the structures. The data is summarized in Table 10.

There was no molecular ion observed for 2 and this is likely due to the instability of the quarternary ion [SnR4]+. The more stable teritiary ion (m/z = 758.9) which resulted from the loss of one perfluorinated ring [SnR3]+ is observed instead. The most abundant ion peak was observed at m/z = 194 which represents a phenyl ring with a single CF3 group attached.

3.2 Synthesis of Fluorinated Tin Dichlorides Tin dichloride derivatives (4 and 5) were synthesized using a redistribution reaction between their parent compounds (1 and 2) and SnCl4 in the neat. The reaction was carried out under a static vacuum condition using high temperatures (150-185°C). These conditions were similar to those used in literature for the synthesis of other tin dichlorides with aryl substituents.46,47 Initially, equimolar amounts of the tetraaryl tin compounds (1-2) and SnCl4 were used. Investigation by
119

Sn-NMR spectroscopy showed that complete

conversion to dichloride did not occur under these conditions and instead a mixture of the mono and dichloro species was being formed. This is likely attributed to the decomposition of SnCl4 and formation of tin metal indicated by the appearance of a black colour. Using Le Châtelier's principle,16 a slight excess of SnCl4 was added to favor the right side of the reaction while keeping other variables constant (temp., reaction time). It was observed that a higher fraction of the dichlorides were obtained with these changes. Therefore better results were obtained when the loss of SnCl4 by decomposition was compensated.

119

Sn-NMR

chemical resonance observed. This was also deemed to be an inverse relationship as evident by the negative slope (upfield shift) of the graph. The electron withdrawing behavior of the CF3 group was expected to have a deshielding effect on the tin nucleus resulting in a downfield field shift (higher ) but the opposite was observed. This indicate that the trend observe in figure 29 is most likely due geometric influence on the electronic structure of these tin dichlorides as a result of the various positions of the CF3 groups. Similar finding were reported by Dräger et al. who demonstrated the influence of geometry on the electronic structure of oligostannanes using 119Sn-NMR spectroscopy.25,26 The 119Sn-NMR shifts for 4 and 5 are found downfield from tetraaryl tin compounds (1,2) due to the presence of two electron withdrawing Cl atoms. The chlorines directly attached to tin cause a considerable amount of deshielding of the tin nuclei, resulting in a large downfield shift (+50 ppm). Figure 26 shows that 5 gave the expected 2/1 ratio in the aromatic region with an ABA substitution pattern while the spectrum for 4 is indicative of an aromatic ring with an AA'BB' 52

substitution. This pattern was expected for a para disubstituted ring but was not evident in 1 where both protons were magnetically equivalent. As expected the 1H-NMR shifts of 4 and 5 are also downfield from their parent compounds (1 and 2) due to the deshielding effect of the chlorine atoms (Figure 26). Sublimation proved to be a suitable method for the purification of both 4 and 5 which resulted in the formation of powdered semi-crystalline products. Similar to their parent compounds, 4 and 5 were also recrystallized by first dissolving in ether followed by slow evaporation. The X-ray crystallographic data for compounds57,58 1-7 are summarized in Table 11 while the crystal structure for 4 and 5 is shown below.

Figure 30: A unit cell molecule defined by the X-ray crystal structure for compounds 4 (right) and 5 (left) Analysis of their crystallographic data showed that compared to their tetraaryl parent compounds 4 and 5 have slightly shorter average Sn-C bond length. This may be due to the presence of the two chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms are electron withdrawing and are therefore expected to pull electron density away from the tin atom. Removal of electron density from the tin center by the chlorine atoms allows the phenyl rings 53

to increase their participation in the bond with tin. This result in the Sn-C bonds having a higher s-character causing them to be stronger and shorter for the dichlorides.

Table 11 also reveals that when compared to 7 the average Sn-C bond length for 4 and 5 are slightly longer. This is likely a consequence of the CF3 groups removing electron density from the Sn-C bond. This decrease in electron density will result in longer bonds since stronger bonds usually require a higher electron density. Bond angles for 4 and 5 also deviate from the ideal tetrahedral geometry, even more so than 1 and 2. Bond angles of 125.9° for the C-Sn-C and 99.23° for Cl-Sn-Cl were observed compound 5 while 4 had C-Sn-C angles of 128.44° and Cl-Sn-Cl angles of 101.76°. The structures for 4 and 5 seem to parallel the two discreet crystal structures found to exist for 7 (a and b).69 This is evident even though the bond angles for 3 and 4 are slightly larger than those of 7a and 7b respectively. Angles that dramatically deviate from tetrahedral geometry were also reported for other dichlorides of Group 14 elements with the level of deviation increase going down the group as result of the increase polarization of the bonds.75 These deviations can be described using Bent's rule which states that the atomic s-character is concentrated in orbitals directed towards electropositive subsituents while the atomic p-character is concentrated in orbitals 54

that are directed towards the electronegative substituent.75 Those orbitals with the greater s-character are expected to have bond angles greater than 109.5° while those with the greater p-character will have angles less than 109.5°. In the case of 4 and 5 the orbitals with more s-character are directed towards the aryl subsitient which results in C-Sn-C bonds > 109.5° while those with higher p-character are directed towards the chlorine atom causing bonds angles to be < 109.5°. MS analysis was also carried out on 5 and the data is listed in the Table 12.

Similar to 2, there was no molecular ion observed for 5. However, unlike 2 a quaternary stannane ion peak was observed for 5 at 596.9 m/z due to the loss of fluorine from a CF3 group. C-F bonds are some of the strongest bonds in chemistry therefore cleavage of this bond is most likely driven by the stability of the ion formed. This explains the observation of the quaternary stannane ion. These ions are typically not observed in mass spectrometry due to the instability when the charge site is located at the tin center. A tertiary ion was also observed for 5 at 580.8 m/z due to the loss of a chlorine atom. The most abundant peak was observed at 194 m/z and this was attributed to a phenyl fragment with a single CF3 attached. This was also the most abundant peak in 2 and suggests that this fragment is very stable likely due to resonance stabilization. The isotopic ratios of the molecular ion peaks also agree with a molecule that contains two chlorine atoms.

3.3 Synthesis of Tin Dihydrides Synthesis of the tin dihydrides derivatives (8,9) from the substitution reaction between tin dichlorides (4, 5) and LiAlH4 are based on similar reactions carried out by Stern et al.60 and Tilley et al.46,47 A 4-fold excess of LiAlH4 was used to ensure complete substitution of chlorides by hydrides. It is known from previous studies that the order in which the reactants were added to the reaction is crucial in obtaining the right products. Following the method used by Tilley et al.,46,47 an ether solution containing the tin dichlorides was cooled to 0°C then added dropwise to another solution at 0°C containing the LiAlH4. The addition of 5 to LiAlH4 resulted in the formation of a white precipitate assumed to be LiCl. The solution remained colorless during the entirety of the reaction. However, the solution unexpectedly turned slightly yellow after the addition of water during quenching. The slightly yellow ether layer was separated from the aqueous layer and then dried over CaCl2 which resulted in the disappearance of the yellow color. Removal of the solvent gave a white solid product which was consistent with other diaryl tin dihydrides from literature.46,47 A119Sn-NMR analysis of the reaction product revealed a resonance signal at -142.3 ppm, which initially was attributed to the tin dihydride, but based on further investigation was determined to be the tin trihydride 9. A resonance at 6.72 ppm was observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum for 9 and was assigned to the protons attached to the tin atom (inset Figure 31). The 19F-NMR spectrum showed that other products were also being formed, probably due to unwanted side reactions. Research in the 1960's showed that cleavage of tin-carbon bond was likely when this bond was sufficiently polar.70 The cleavage of tin-carbon bond in fluorinated compounds in the presence of a base was first reported by Holmes et al.71 Later work by Stern et al.60 showed that substitution of chlorine using hydride nucleophiles were prone to side reactions when a fluorinated substituent was bound to the tin. In an attempted synthesis of tris(p-chlorophenyl) tin hydride from the corresponding chloride and LiAlH4 Stern and Becker were able to isolate chlorobenzene as a byproduct which suggested there was a cleavage of the tin-aryl bond.60 It was argued that the tin center was more electrophilic due to the presence 56

Figure 31: 1H-NMR spectrum for the tin trihydride 9 showing the phenyl and hydride region (inset)

of the electron withdrawing chloro group on the phenyl ring. This resulted in the tin being more susceptible to attack from strong nucleophiles such as LiAlH4. A similar finding was also reported by Bregadze et al.70 when di(phenylbarenyl)tin dichloride was treated with a strong base/nucleophile such as KOH. In this work they reported that 30% of the tin-carbon was cleaved as evident by the isolation of phenylbarene from the reaction.70 It is suspected that a similar reaction is taking place in this work, where the presence of the CF3 groups result in an increase polarization of the tin-aryl bond. Therefore, while the goal is substitution of the chlorine atoms it likely that the phenyl-tin bonds are also being cleaved by LiAlH4. This can lead to a substitution reaction whereby two chlorine atoms and a fluorinated phenyl are replaced with three hydride atoms. In the case of 8, a slight yellow color appeared before the addition of water and the final product was isolated as a yellowish-white solid which gave a major 119Sn-NMR resonance at -145 ppm (Figure 32).

57

Figure 32: 119Sn-NMR spectrum for the tin hydride 8 This shift is very similar to that of 9 and was therefore attributed to the tin trihydride. In the case of 4, the fluorinated group is in the para position which Stern et al. suggest may lead to the formation of hexakis(4trifluoromethylphenyl) ditin compound or other unwanted side products.60 It may be possible to limit these side reactions by lowering the reaction temperature, varying the LiAlH4/monomer ratio or reducing the reaction time. For both 8 and 9, interpretation of the 1H-NMR and
19

F-NMR spectra proved to be difficult

due to the number of peaks, but the major peaks were attributed to the tin trihydrides. The polymerization behavior of these crude materials in the presence of metal catalyst was also used as an indirect indication that these crude materials were indeed tin trihydrides. 3.4a Synthesis of Polymers using Wurtz Coupling At the moment there are only a few examples of Wurtz coupling being used for the synthesis of high molecular weight polystannanes.31,35 The two previous examples were carried out using a modified version of these reaction. This modification involves introduction of 15-crown-5-ether and lowering of the reaction time and temperature (Figure 33).35

Figure 33: Schematic diagram for the Wurtz coupling of compounds 4 and 5 In this research it was also observed that the best results were obtained when dispersions from purified sodium metal were used along with the modifications mentioned. Unpurified sodium resulted in the formation of a yellow solution with poor dispersion of the remaining sodium metal; this maybe due to oxidation at the sodium surface. Using the reaction condition outlined by Price et al.35, the monomer 4 and 5 were Wurtz coupled using reaction times of 4h to prevent the formation of cyclic oligomers. These compounds were isolated as a yellow tinged powder in the case of 10 and yellow waxy solid for 11. Based on previous studies carried out in our group it was known that polystannanes were dark yellow to orange in color. A chromophoric shift for these fluorinated polystannanes was suspected based on their color which remained a pale yellow. The product was further purified by precipitation from cold hexanes (-48°C).

3.4b Synthesis of polystannynes using dehydrocoupling Polystannynes were prepared by dehydrocoupling using Kardstedt catalyst, (Pt2{[(CH2=CH)Me2Si]2O}3), which was previously known to carry out hydrosilylation reactions. This catalyst was shown to be useful for 59

the dehydrocoupling of bifunctional Group 14 monomers by Baumgartner et al.72 With the exception of the catalyst, all other conditions were similar to those used by Caseri et al.22,48 in their synthesis of polystannanes. Their catalyst of choice RhCl(PPh3)3, was shown to be ineffective to monomers with bulky substituents that were directly attached to the tin atom and therefore a Pt catalyst was explored in this work (Figure 34).

Figure 34: Schematic diagram for the dehydrocoupling of tin trihydride monomer 8 and 9 to yield polymers 12 and 13 The polystannynes prepared from the dehydrocoupling of 8 and 9 had brownish-yellow colors that were consistent with other polystannanes from literature. The products synthesized by Wurtz coupling (10, 11) and dehydrocoupling (12 and 13) were characterized using GPC, NMR, UV/VIS and elemental analysis.

3.5 UV/VIS Spectroscopy Polystannanes are known to have UV-VIS absorbance values > 380 nm.21 As the data in Table 13 shows, the polystannanes synthesized by Wurtz coupling are drastically blue-shifted compared to other linear 60

polystannanes from the literature.24,41 This is especially true for polystannanes with aryl subsitutuents which are known to have absorbance values > 440 nm.46,47 Tilley suggested aryl substituted polystannanes were red-shifted compared to those with alkyl subsituents due to their  ­  mixing.46,47 In his review of polysilanes, Miller showed that the * of the aryl interacts with the antibonding MO of the polysilanes while the  orbitals interact with the bonding orbitals.51 These two effects lead to a stabilization of the LUMO and destabilization of the HOMO resulting in a smaller band gap. This effect was amplified by the addition of  donating groups such as alkoxy moieties unto the phenyl subsituent.47,50 In this work, the opposite is observed since the CF3 groups are highly withdrawing and therefore are expected to lower the amount of  ­  mixing, resulting in blue-shift of the absorption wavelength. The introduction of the bulky fluorinated group may also affect the conformation of the polymer backbone. This would agree with previous literature where perfluoro groups have been shown to "harden" the backbone structure of molecules.56 These conformational changes may result in a decrease of the orbital overlap required for maximum conjugation. It was previously shown that a planar zig-zag conformation is most ideal for lower band gap polystannanes.47,50 The suspected reduction of the  ­  and the change in backbone conformation by the introduction of the fluorinated groups may have resulted in the drastic blue-shift observed in these linear polystannanes. On the other hand, investigation by UV/VIS spectroscopy showed that the polystanylenes obtained by dehydrocoupling are redshifted compared to those synthesized via Wurtz coupling and this is due to the difference between their structures (Table 13). Table 13: UV/VIS data for polymers synthesized by Wurtz and Dehydrocoupling Compound 10 11 12 13 Synthesis Method Wurtz Coupling Wurtz Coupling Dehydrocoupling Dehydrocoupling 61 UV/VIS data 332 nm 328 nm 350 nm 354 nm

The shape of the spectrum observed for the polystannynes synthesized by dehydrocoupling is indicative of network structure. Group 14 network polymers were first synthesized by the Bianconi group who prepared germanium and silicon 3-dimensional (3-D) polymers from their respective trichloride monomers.73 Polystannyne analogs were later synthesized by the Okano group using electrochemistry.37 Both groups observed that Group 14 network polymers showed significant tailing into the visible region. A similar behaviour is observed for the polystannynes synthesized using dehydrocoupling in this work (see Figures 36 and 37). These polymers show tailing into the visible region at wavelength > 700 nm. The red-shift compared to the linear polystannanes can be explained by the increased conjugation as a result of the additional Sn-Sn bonds present in these network structures (Figure 35).34

Figure 35: Structure for network polymers (12 and 13) synthesized in this work As previously mentioned, an increase in the number of molecular orbital decreases the separation between the valence and conduction band causing a bathochromic shift. A similar finding was reported for polysilanes and polygermanes when moving from the linear to network 3-D polymers.34,73 The isolation of

62

network polymer in this work is due to the polymerization of the tin trihydrides that were inadvertently synthesized. This resulted from the unexpected cleavage of a tin-aryl bond by the nucleophile LiAlH4.

12

Figure 36: UV/VIS spectrum for 12 after dehydrocoupling These polymers are expected to be more unstable than the linear counterparts due to 3-D tin-tin bond being longer than those in linear polystannanes.36 Evidence of instability is shown when compound 13 was irradiated by successive scans in UV/VIS region (Figure 37). Initially, the spectrum shows a max of 350 nm with the extensive tailing that is indicative of network polymers. However, there is an obvious change in the absorption spectrum for 13 when the sample was irradiated a second time with light in the UV-VIS region (Figure 37).

63

13

Figure 37: UV/VIS spectrum for 13 after 1 and 2 scans of UV/VIS The UV-VIS scans are identical at wavelengths greater than ~375 nm but deviate below this point. The most obvious change is the disappearance of the peak due to the --* transition at 350 nm. Disappearance of this peak after only two scans suggests that the polymers, potentially due to the loss of linear segments from dihydride monomers, are being degraded at a fairly rapid rate when exposed to the light in the UV/VIS region. Similar studies were carried by Okano et al. who showed that these network polymers are more sensitive to light than their linear counterparts.37 3.6 GPC analysis GPC was used in this work for the molecular weight determination of the polymers synthesized by both Wurtz and dehydrocoupling. A GPC equipped with a triple detector array was employed and calibrated against broad and narrow molecular weight polystyrene standards. The molecular weights obtained by triple detection provided absolute molecular weights which represents a first for polystannanes. While dehydrocoupling and electrochemical coupling have yielded only moderate molecular weight polymer in the ~104 Da range, 22,24,38,47 Wurtz coupling was shown by Zou et al.31 as a suitable method for the synthesis of 64

high molecular weight polystannanes (~106 Da range). Polystannanes are sensitive to both light and moisture and therefore samples for GPC were prepared using dried THF and wrapped in aluminum foil to shield from light. The molecular weight obtained by the Wurtz coupling in this work are between 1.73 × 104- 2.92 × 107 Da for 10 which at the moment represents the highest reported molecular weight achieved for polystannane.68 Compound 10 gave a polymodal GPC curve indicating polymers of varying molecular weights were synthesized. This also suggests that the problems synonymous with Wurtz coupling, although reduced, have not completely disappeared. In the case of 11, molecular weight acquisition proved to be more challenging due to the instability of these polymers to the laser light source of the RI and light scattering detector. Initial calculated molecular weights suggest that these polymers had broken down into oligomers. An absolute molecular weight of 1.47 × 105 Da was finally obtained for 11 using a UV absorbing molecule (UVA) that slowed the rate of depolymerization in the presence of radiation. Figure 38 shows the GPC chromatogram for compound 10 in the presence of a UV absorbing molecule. Previous work by Caseri et al. investigated the stability of polystannanes when irradiated with light in the presence of different light absorbers and radical scavengers.74 The formation of oligostannanes by the chain scission of polystannanes was dramatically reduced in the presence of these absorbing molecules. The goal of the light absorbing molecule was to prevent depolymerisation of the polystannane without interfering with the molecular weight determination. Therefore a sample containing only the light absorbing molecule dissolved in THF was investigated by GPC. Based on the elution time of these molecules interference with the molecular weight determination was unlikely. A control was also employed in this method using [nBu2Sn]n. Molecular weight obtained for [nBu2Sn]n in the absence and presence of the UVA were comparable which is seen as a validation of this method. Therefore the molecular weights obtained using this method can be deemed accurate.

Figure 38: Chromatogram of refractive index (red), low angle light scattering (black) and right angle light scattering detectors after GPC analysis of 11 The GPC chromatogram for compound 11 indicated that this polymer is monomodal. Isolation of a monomodal polystannane in the case of 11 highlights the superiority of the modified Wurtz coupling used in this work to earlier version of this reaction. Earlier versions of the Wurtz coupling reaction used for the polymerization of Group 14 compounds often resulted in low molecular weights with poor polydispersity. A similar method was attempted for polymer 12 and 13 but proved to be unsuccessful. The failure to analyze these network polymers using GPC even in the presence of a light absorbing molecule highlights their increased sensitivity towards light in THF. It may be necessary to investigate other UVA molecules in order to find more suitable candidates for these systems.

Sn-NMR chemical shifts of -48

10

11

Figure 39: A plot of the 119Sn-NMR signals for polymers 10 and 11

Such a shift was expected as two Sn-Cl bonds are replaced two Sn-Sn bonds. With the chlorine substituents being more electronegative, a deshielding of the tin nucleus and resultant downfield shift is expected. Figure 39 shows that the
119

Sn-NMR chemical shifts for polymers 10 and 11 are very similar to each other. This
119

follows a trend that saw the

Sn-NMR chemical shifts of the corresponding tetraaryl and dichloride
119

compounds also being similar. These

Sn-NMR shifts are downfield from other poly(diaryl)stannanes.

This is likely due to the presence of the CF3 groups and/or the geometric influence on the electronic structure by the bulky fluorinated substituents. Similar to chlorine, these groups are strongly electron withdrawing and can cause a deshielding of the tin nucleus. It is also possible that the geometric effect of the fluorinated ring 67

is influencing these 119Sn-NMR chemical resonance values. More investigation is required at this moment to prove this hypothesis.

Figure 40: 1H-NMR spectrum for compound 11 after Wurtz coupling The NMR spectra from Wurtz coupling are surprisingly clean considering that these reactions are known to give numerous unidentified products.32 The 1H-NMR spectrum for compound 11 shows that only one product is isolated (Figure 40) which is also agrees with the monomodal curves observed in the GPC chromatogram for this compound. This also suggests that the problems associated with Wurtz couplings have been reduced in this work. The NMR spectra of the compounds prepared by dehydrocoupling compounds 8 and 9 showed evidence of more than one product but there are major products.

Figure 41: 19F-NMR spectrum after the dehydrocoupling of 9 to yield polmer 13 There was a characteristic downfield shift in the 119Sn-NMR chemical shift from the hydrides to polymers in the case of both 12 and 13. In the case of 12 there is downfield shift of approximately 10 ppm from the corresponding hydride 8. Compound 13 on the other hand shows a downfield shift of approximately 15 ppm from the hydride 9. This is in agreement with other polystannanes from literature synthesized by dehydrocoupling where the polymers are known to be 10-15 ppm downfield from the dihydride.22

Conclusion Polystannanes represent a new growing class of inorganic materials that are being exploited for their novel properties. The elements of the Group 14 have displayed electronic properties that have spurred interest in these compounds. The chemistry of polystannanes has grown dramatically in the last 20 years. Earlier investigation of polystannanes focused largely on synthetic methods that are ideal for the production of linear polymers such as temperature, length of reaction and catalyst of choice. This was followed by work that focused on the influence of the substituent on the band gap of polystannanes. More recent investigation have focused on the stability of these compounds under different conditions such temperature, solvent and the presence of dyes and/or radical scavengers. This work represents the first investigation of the stability of polystannanes by the incorporation of a stabilizing factor onto the backbone of the molecule. The research indentified that the organolithium route is superior to the Grignard route in the preparation of fluorinated systems with respect to overall yield, length of reaction and ease purification. This work also demonstrated that the harsh conditions required for the preparation of tin dichlorides resulted in some decomposition of SnCl4. Complete conversion to dichlorides were only successful when the loss of SnCl4 was compensated for. X-ray analysis of the crystals obtained by recrystallization from ether show dramatic deviation from tetrahedral geometry. It is believed that the electronic and structural influence of the bulky fluorinated phenyl ring is partially responsible for these deviations. Bent's rule was also used to explain these deviations whereby an increase in the s and p-character of some orbital resulted in the deviation of the bond angles from ideal tetrahedral geometry. The polarization of the Sn-aryl bond due to the presence of the CF3 groups is blamed for the inadvertent synthesis of tin trihydride monomers by cleavage of the tin-aryl bond by LiAlH4. The increase in reactivity of this bond suggests these compounds may warrant their own unique parameters instead of using those 70

based non-fluorinated systems. Dehydrocoupling of these trihydrides produced network polymers polystannanes with max values of 350 and 354 nm that were blueshifted compared to poly(diaryl)stannanes. These were, however, red shifted when compared to their linear analogs prepared by Wurtz coupling as a result of the increase conjugation from the additional Sn-Sn bond. The -- mixing normally observed in poly(diaryl)stannanes are absent or even reversed by the electron withdrawing nature of the CF3 groups. Molecular weight acquisition was investigated in the presence of a light absorbing molecule. However, GPC analysis for the network polymers was unsuccessful due to the increase instability as a result of the three dimensional tin-tin bonds. Stronger light absorbing molecules maybe required if absolute molecular weights are to be determined for these network polymers. These molecules are necessary to slow chain scission by the light source of the GPC detectors. Polymerization of the dichlorides using Wurtz coupling proved once again to be suitable for the synthesis of high molecular weight polystannanes. The molecular weights obtained here are the highest reported for polystannanes, on the order of 102 larger than those obtained by other methods. It was initially believed that incorporation of fluorinated groups into the backbone of these polymers would increase their stability particularly to moisture. Surprisingly the perfluorinated polymers prepared are more sensitive than other non-fluorinated polystannanes. It is suspected that an increase in the electrophilicity of the tin centers is making these compounds more sensitive. GPC analysis was only made possible by the use of a UV absorbing dye. The GPC values obtained in this work represents the first absolute molecular weights reported for polystannanes. The polymer 11 gave a monomodal GPC curve shows that the problems normally associated with Wurtz coupling such as formation of cyclic oligomers is greatly reduced using the modified Wurtz reaction. However, the polymodal curve obtained for 10 suggested that these problems have not altogether disappeared. The polymers isolated from Wurtz coupling were blue shifted compared to poly(diaryl)stannanes from literature with absorption max values of 328 and 332 nm. This dramatic blue 71

shift is attributed to the electronic and conformational influence of the fluorinated groups. If higher max are to be obtained for fluorinated compound it is likely that methylene bridges will have to be used to minimize the effect of the fluorine on the central tin atom. In doing not only will these molecules absorb at a longer wavelength but they may also have the desired hydrophobic effect from the fluorinated groups. It was anticipated that the incorporation of perfluoro groups into the backbone of polystannanes would increase their moisture stability. However, because of their severe sensitivity towards light no moisture stability tests were carried out on these polymers. The work done here was instrument in further characterizing the structural and electronic behaviour of fluorinated tin compounds. This work can therefore be used a stepping stone in the march towards light and moisture stable polystannanes. Future Work At the moment there are no known polystannane polymers that are stable in the presence of moisture or light. In order for polystannanes to become useful materials, stabilizing their structure in presence of light and moisture is paramount. This research shows that there is adverse effect when the fluorinated groups are too close to the tin atom. Therefore future work could investigate subsituent with fluorinated groups that are separated by methylene bridges. A series of these compounds will be synthesized by varying the length of the methylene bridge in order to find the optimum distance for the perfluoro groups. The optimum distance would be a distance that reduces the electronic effect of the perfluoro group on the tin center while still providing moisture stability. GPC investigations showed that it was possible to stablize polystannanes in the presence of light by utilizing an external factor such as a UV absorbing (UVA) molecule. Ultimately, future work will also include insertion of UVA moieties into the backbone of polystannanes with hope that this will stabilize the chain to light. The final goal will be the combination of the light and moisture stabilizing work.

72

This will involve insertion of the groups that provides both moisture and light stabilization. This group will be chosen based on information gathered from the individual work done in moisture and light stabilization.
