ABSTRACT
FIBROUS NANOMATERIALS FOR ENHANCED LIGHT ABSORPTION AND ITS APPLICATION IN PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY CONVERSION

Doctoral of Philosophy, 2012 Abdul Salam Mahmood Mechanical and industrial Engineering
This thesis presents a new, simple and precise nano-scale fabrication technique: by using femtosecond laser irradiation to develop novel nanofibrous structures. The wellorganized web-like structure will have a high surface area that agglomerates through fusion to form interweaving fibrous structures. These structures will significantly advance microelectronic, biomedical and photonic devices. The novel optical properties in nanofibrous structures made of silicon, metal and coated material will be applicable to new solar cell technology. The synthesis, characterization, and specification of materials such as silicon, titanium, aluminum and gold-silicon are discussed in detail. Existing theories of nanoparticle formation by femtosecond ablation were used to explain some of the observed phenomena. Most of the research was devoted to the influence of laser parameters on the spectral response of web-like fibrous nanostructures. These approaches then elaborated to connect the laser parameters (pulse width, pulse frequency, laser polarization and laser dwell time) with the enhancement of optical properties of silicon nanofibre. The periodic micro-hole arrays decorated in aluminum nanofibre structure improved the light extinction of solar cells, which is fully demonstrated through this research. Instead of doping, sputtering iii

deposition, or ball milling, the rutile (tetragonal) titanium oxide TiO 2 nanospheres particles were created through irradiated bulk Ti using a femtosecond laser at an ambient condition. The growth of TiO 2 nanostructure is highly recommended for the applications of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSCC) and photovoltaic applications. The number of laser pulses was also used to control the synthesis of the nanofibrous structure of a thin gold layer on a silicon wafer. The highly improved coupling efficiency between the light and the bulk quantity of gold nanoparticles may be attributed to the excitation of confined plasmon modes on structured metal surfaces. The prototype and design approach of photovoltaic (PV) based on silicon nanomaterials is presented in the application section. The illuminated and dark I­V curves and the power conversion density vs. voltage curve were obtained using a standard solar simulator.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Motivation for Research
Nanotechnology is an emerging frontier for the development of various future devices due to its relevance in several industrial technologies, including photovoltaic (PV), electro-optical and micromechanical [1]. In particular, green nanotechnology is significant because it focuses on the development of clean technologies that will minimize potential environmental and human health risks associated with the manufacture and use of nanotechnology products [2]. The main goal of green nanotechnology is to encourage the replacement of existing products with new nanoproducts that are more environmentally friendly throughout their lifecycle. Rising energy prices are making alternative energy sources increasingly cost-effective ­ in the near future, renewable energy sources such as solar energy will be competitive in the energy market without the need for subsidization [4]. Thus the application of nanotechnology in green power has a bright future: it is renewable, available in unlimited quantities [3], and will not emit byproducts that are detrimental to the climate. Solar cell manufacturing (based on the technology of single crystalline PVs) currently represents one of the fastest growing industries, which is growing approximately at 40% per year [5]. Yet current solar cell technology is inefficient, which is difficult to overcome with current semiconductor based solar cells made from materials such as silicon. Inefficiency occurs because incoming photons, or light, must have the right energy, called band gap energy, to knock out an electron: if the photon has less energy than the band gap energy then it will pass through the solar cell, and if 1

it has more energy than the band gap, extra energy will be wasted as heat. More research is required to advance nanotechnology to support the development of cheaper and more efficient solar cells, using novel materials rather than the semiconductors currently in use. Both organic and inorganic nanomaterials have been investigated, such as nano-crystals, nano-particles and thin semiconducting layers, usually of amorphous or polycrystalline substance. The nanomaterials are typically deposited on a cheap glass, plastic or stainless steel substrate that can convert sunlight into electricity at a fraction of the cost of silicon solar cells.

1.2 State-of-the-Art Solar Cells
Photovoltaic (PV) technology is a simple and elegant method of harnessing solar power. Solar cells are unique because of their capacity to convert incident solar radiation into electricity without any noise, pollution or moving parts, making them reliable, long lasting and robust [71]. Three different mechanisms can be used for photovoltaic applications: (1) scattering from the metal particles that also act as dipoles (far-field effect), (2) near field enhancement, and (3) direct generation of charge carriers in the semiconductor substrate [6]. There are four unavoidable losses from the use of PVs: incomplete absorption, thermalization (carrier cooling), thermodynamic loss, and radiative recombination (which limits the solar conversion efficiency of a device with a single absorption threshold or band gap [7, 8]). These losses result from single-crystalline and multicrystalline silicon wafer-based PCs (the first generation of solar cells), which are operated under forward bias: when light is absorbed, an electron is promoted from the

2

highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), forming an exciton [12, 13] (see Figure 1.1 [14]).

Figure 1.1: Schematic drawing of the working principle of photovoltaic [14] The use of silicon in these single-crystalline and multi-crystalline wafer-based photovoltaic has several shortcomings: as silicon is an indirect band gap material, it is a poor light emitter and cannot be used to detect many important wavelengths. Overall, silicon solar cells fail to convert nearly a third of the sun's spectrum into electricity , as shown in Figure 1.2. First generation silicon solar cells have high initial costs for equipment and also require a large surface area for the system to be efficient as a source of electricity. Thus, thin-film cells (second generation PV) offer decisive economic advantages by enabling lightweight and highly flexible PV modules that have lower material cost with more flexibility. Thin-film cells are made of CIGS (Copper, Indium, Gallium Selenium), which are generated by coating a substrate (e.g., a glass panel) with layers of conductive and semi-conductive materials of a few micrometers in thickness. Many studies have been conducted to increase second-generation PV optical absorption; unfortunately, thin-film solar cells also have poor light absorption because long path

3

lengths of photons are required. With time, second generation PV technology might be expected to largely advance first generation PV products [14], however, for solar cells to work efficiently, the initial photo-induced charge separation process must be fast, efficient and able to create a stable charge-separated state [9]. These concepts rely on using third-generation PV technology [10], which includes dye-sensitized solar cells, organic polymer-based photovoltaic, multi-junction solar cells, hot carrier solar cells, and multi-band and thermo-photovoltaic solar cells [11].

1.3 Characterizing Solar Cell and PV Terminology
The terms that most accurately characterize the overall behaviour of a solar cell are (1) the current versus voltage curves, (2) the maximum power point, and (3) the fill factor (see Figure 1.3).

Figure 1.3: Schematic of I­V curves. The open circuit voltage ( circuit current ( ) are shown [16]. The short-circuit current (

) and the short-

is the largest current which may be drawn from the solar

cell [15], which defines how the cell operates if a wire is connected between its terminals, shorting it out. The open-circuit voltage ( is the maximum voltage

available from a solar cell, which occurs at zero current. The open-circuit voltage corresponds to the amount of forward bias on the solar cell [16]. Thus, the maximum power point is the point on the I-V curve of a solar cell that corresponds to the maximum output electrical power as The fill factor (FF) is the ratio that describes how close the I-V curve of a solar cell resembles a perfect rectangle, which represents the ideal solar cell: 5

(1.1) The basic idea behind these experiments is to employ a nano fibrous structure as the functional unit in which electrons are confined to create a large interfacial area between the donor and acceptor species. These nano fibre confinement effects have elevated this strategy to become one of the best candidates that can be used in a DSSC (dye sensitized solar-cell). When light is absorbed, the dye generates bound electron-hole pairs upon absorption of photons and undergoes dissociation to release them as free electrons and holes, where they are injected into the metal oxide nano fibre and transported for collection at the electrode [17]. The benefit of a metal nano fibrous structure within a nano-size dimension is that synthesis through femtosecond laser will gain an inverse Auger recombination or impact ionization, which can utilize some of the excess energy of photo-generated carriers to create additional electron-hole pairs in PV devices [18]. In addition, metal nanostructures are capable of supporting various plasmon modes. By controlling the shape of the metal nanostructure, the researcher can control the mode of oscillation. In turn, optical properties such as enhancement of scattering or absorptance can be altered [19]. To enhance the efficiency of solar cells, researchers have had to look at every stage of improving the quality of materials to innovate a new technology versus the time scale, as shown in figure 1-4. It has been demonstrated that the traditional Si PV has been very close to the theoretical limit of 33.7% under the AM 1.5 G solar spectrums with an intensity of 1000 W/m 2.

Figure 1.4: NREL compilation of best research-cell efficiency [70]

Figure 1.4 demonstrates that high cost first generation PV devices no longer have the capacity to be competitive in the renewable energy market. Yet research and investment into PV devices remain attractive: the potential for commercialization is very high and the cost is low enough to support the conversion of the light into clean and environmentally friendly electricity [71].

1.4 Nanomaterials for Solar Cells
In recent years, there has been an intense interest in the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterial. Synthesis methods for nanomaterial are typically grouped into two categories: "top-down" and "bottom-up" [20]. The top-down method involves the

7

division of a massive solid into smaller portions, which may require milling or attrition, chemical methods, and volatilization of a solid followed by condensation of the volatilized components. In contrast, the bottom-up method involves the condensation of atoms or molecular entities in a gas phase or in solution. Another method, known as conventional chemical reduction, uses hazardous chemicals and has no means of controlling the size and shape of nanomaterials; however, lasers have provided a powerful tool to synthesize nanomaterials in both solutions and gas matrices. Ultrafast lasers are a promising tool for processing the materials [21], especially on small length scales. In particular, the combination of enhanced surface topography of materials and metal implants has enhanced the performance of nanomaterial implants in PV devices. Research has demonstrated that both microstructures and nanostructures play important roles in light absorption and optical properties, however, future PV development must also account for features and properties that arise when solids deviate from a perfectly ordered structure [22]. Various methods of surface structuring have been studied in the past, such as: vacuum synthesis (sputtering, laser ablation, and liquid-metal ion sources), gas-phase synthesis (inert gas condensation, oven sources, DC and RF magnetron sputtering), condensed-phase synthesis (gas jet high speed deposition, thin film deposition by ionized cluster beams) and deposition methods (chemical vapour deposition CVD, physical vapour deposition PVD, sol-gel method). Most of these efforts focus on converting single crystalline material to multicrystalline structures to increase the light absorption of PV devices. Thus, future research should aim to develop innovative device designs and ultimately new material systems [23] to reduce

8

weight and maintain structural integrity while simultaneously improving the conversion efficiency of PV cells. Nanomaterials exhibit remarkable properties that can support these design solutions due to the large surface area-to-volume ratio, high surface energy, and spatial confinement. Yet when the dimensions of a material become comparable to the spatial extent of the electrons that occupy it, the materials start to exhibit quantum confinement effects. Fortunately, quantum confinement effects are only significant for nanometer size, so the most immediate consequence of the confinement effect is an increase in the band gap energy and an associated increased probability of radiative transfer [80]. To address these synthesis challenges, researchers need to consider using grown III-V nanostructures like quantum wires (QWs), and quantum dots (QDs), nanowires, nano fibre and nanotubes to enhance the performance of the current solar cells.

1.4.1 Nanowires
Nanowires have the potential to impact many different PV technologies through improved material properties, offering a new geometry not possible with bulk or thin film devices [24]. The structure of nanowires also provides a more efficient way to absorb light and extract electrons freed by the light. Moreover, nanowire- solar cells allow the light absorption to decouple from the direction of carrier transport in materials where the diffusion length of minority carriers are much shorter than the thickness of material required for optimal light absorption [25]. Recognizing this potential, researchers have recently explored new fabrication processes to effectively create nanowire structures, using a range of metallic and semiconductor materials 9

(shown in Figure 1.5). Several physical and chemical techniques have also been exploited to develop nanowire, including directional crystal growth, sol-gel techniques, template-based methods, and others. The chemical approach involves selecting suitable precursor chemicals, which are subjected to heat treatment under different atmospheric conditions, whereas the physical method consists of heating until the material evaporates and is deposited: this material vapor condenses to form a thin film on the cold substrate surface and the vacuum chamber walls. Low pressures are usually used, about 10-6 or 10-5 Torr. , to avoid reaction between the vapor and atmosphere. In addition, stacking nanowires make it possible to stack a number of sub cells (junctions); in this process, each sub-cell converts one color of sunlight to optimize its use for electricity. Thus far, the highest yield reported for nanowire solar cell efficiency is around of 8.4 .

Vacuum thermal evaporation deposition techniques for nanowires have the highest potential due to their high physical properties and possible applications in the nano-photovoltaic devices [26]; however, these methods only work well with a limited set of solid materials that contain highly anisotropic structures.

1.4.2 Colloidal quantum dot (CQD)
Generally, the colloidal quantum dot system is composed of three components: precursors, organic surfactants, and solvents [28]. These precursors chemically transform into monomers when heating a reaction medium to a sufficiently high temperature: once the monomers reach a high enough super saturation level, the nanocrystals growth starts with a nucleation process. When these different-sized nanocrystals combine as colloidal quantum dots on one solar cell, the solar cells can absorb more light and thereby deliver power at greater efficiencies than solar cells made of bulk semiconductors. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) can be synthesized using drop-casting, [29] spin-coating [30, 53], ink-jet printing [30] and other materials. Theoretically, a single intermediate electronic band created by quantum dots (QDs) would offer a 63.2% efficiency of an ordinary solar cell, which greatly exceeds the maximum conversion efficiency of 31% for even a single-junction device [32]. Importantly, colloidal quantum dot (CQD) PV devices have the capacity to harvest the sun's visible, near-infrared, and short-wavelength infrared rays [31]. When quantum dots are formed into an ordered three-dimensional array, a strong electronic coupling forms between them, which extends the life of excitons and facilitates the collection and transport of `hot carriers' to generate electricity at high

11

voltage. QDs also have band gaps that are tenable across a wide range of energy levels, changing the quantum dot size through the three-dimensional confinement of carriers (see Figure 1.6), whereas bulk materials have a band gap fixed by the choice of material composition.

Figure 1.6: Schematic of Colloidal quantum dot solar cells [33]

1.4.3 Nanotubes
Due to their high strength, stiffness, and electrical conductivity, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are designated as one of the most attractive materials for PV applications and have been integral in the development of new hybrid solar cells [34] (see Figure 1.7). These 3D nanotube structures can trap and absorb light received from many different angles, and the new cells remain efficient even when the sun is not directly overhead [38]. In contrast, highly ordered, vertically oriented, crystalline TiO 2 Nanotubes arrays (fabricated by potentiostatic anodization) provide good pathways for electron migration through the active layer in the solar cells [39]. To maximize effectiveness, the nanotube architecture must be well organized and strongly interconnected to eliminate randomization of the grain network and 12

increase contact points for electrical connections [37]. There are a number of methods of making nanotube such as plasma arcing method, laser method, chemical vapor deposition and ball milling. To produce high purity results with large production goals, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method that introduces catalysts in the form of gas particulates or as solid support should be used [35, 36]. Nanotubes could also be replaced by metal oxide electrodes and work as a conductive coating layer in solar cells [39] because of their transparency properties (active photosensing materials).

Figure 1.7: Schematic of nanotube array solar cells [33]

1.4.4 Nanofiber
According to the National Science Foundation, a nanofiber is defined as having at least one dimension of one hundred nanometers or less. Nanofiber is an important class of one dimension nanostructures for the development of next-generation transparent electrodes. Compared with other transparent electrodes, these metal-based transparent electrodes have the best performance in terms of optical transparency and sheet resistance (see Figure 1.8). Depending on the applications, various methods of nanofiber preparation will require chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel processing, spray pyrolysis, co-precipitation, 13

electro spinning, self-assembly, phase separation synthesis, metathesis reactions, two step electrochemical synthesis, laser ablation, etc. [12]. Most of those synthesis methods need a chemical catalysis or gaseous background [40].

Figure 1.8: Schematic of nanofiber solar cells [41]

1.5 Laser Processing for Solar-cell Fabrication
Formation of nanostructures through laser ablation facilitates a more simple equipment configuration and low operation costs. The rapid superheating caused by the extreme short pulse duration has the potential to open up new possibilities to improve the processes involved in nanoparticle synthesis [42]. Most of the current hydrodynamic models suggest that the nanofiber aggregates form by agglomeration of nucleated nanoparticles in a highly pressurized fluid undergoing rapid quenching at a critical point during the expansion of the vaporized plume in the air [43]. Nanoparticle production will occur in various target systems and under various heating regimes through heterogeneous decomposition, liquid phase ejection and fragmentation,

14

homogeneous

and

decomposition,

spinodal

decomposition,

and

photomechanical ejection [44]. In particular, femtosecond lasers offer two important features: femtosecond lasers do not interact with the ejected material and, if time is delayed, the laser pulse can be used to control particle formation once the underlying dynamics are well understood [45]. Moreover, the femtosecond laser can also prevent the plasma shielding of incoming laser beams through ablated material, which can lead to maximum absorption efficiency [46]. When a semiconductor material is irradiated by high pulse laser energy, the laser creates a bath of hot electrons and holes to deposit its energy into a solid. Hot carriers subsequently transfer energy to the lattice by creating optical and acoustic phonons while threading recombination acts to reheat the carriers [45]. Thus, femtosecond lasers increase the yield (or throughput) levels and improve the efficiency of solar cells. In order to limit the length of this review, primarily focusing will be on equiaxed nanometer-sized structures as well as thin films synthesized by laser ablation. Pulsedlaser processing is a cold-walled process that excites only beam-focused areas, enabling a clean ambient, which is considered a highly suitable alternative to PVD or CVD for nanoparticle synthesis [47, 48]. The last several years have witnessed an explosion of interest in understanding and exploiting the optical properties of nanomaterials synthesis by laser processing. The intensity of a femtosecond laser pulse can be high enough to cause nonlinear interactions between a transparent medium and the laser field, which creates conditions in which the material can effectively absorb energy from the laser field through free electrons.

15

The formation of the surface structure for PV devices (using ultrafast laser irradiation) is an iterative process influenced by the simultaneous action of physical surface deformation mechanisms, such as material melting and capillary wave formation, evaporation, etching and ablation. The effectiveness of each deformation mechanism in this complex surface reshaping process is affected by the irradiating laser parameters (wavelength, pulse duration, pulse energy/fluence, and number of pulses). Using femtosecond lasers to generate nanostructure for high absorption materials is another approach of generating high efficient solar cells (see Figure 1.9). To minimize reflection from the flat surface, the multicrystalline materials (such as silicon wafers) are textured with a laser, creating a roughened surface so that incident light may have a larger probability of being absorbed. [51]. For example, Vorobyev et al. [52] showed that optical properties of metal surfaces can be significantly modified by surface structuring with femtosecond laser processing and nano roughness [52, 14]. It is important to note that the formation of nanoparticles during femtosecond laser ablation of material is affected by presence of background gas like , , , , and

more. The results suggest that laser structuring and sulfur doping of silicon is a robust way to extend the photo-responsivity of silicon into the near-infrared [59]. Treating black silicon with a high-intensity laser was recently used to increase solar-cell efficiency [60]. Mazur et al. (2005) realized that black silicon converts much more sunlight into electricity than any device now on in the market because it absorbs infrared radiation (heat) [61].The black silicon is a good detector of clouds, pollution, water vapour, and specks of dirt and liquid that change the quality of the air and

16

influence the global climate [61, 62]. Our research shows that there is the potential for another significant PV enhancement due to a new type of distinct structure, namely nanostructure-covered laser-induced periodic surface structures (NC-LIPSS): the photocurrent increases approximately 30% in these laser-textured zones [53, 54, and 55]. Reducing the reflection of a (100) silicon surface through specific chemical texturization procedures was also used to improve the solar-cell efficiency [56-58].

1.6 Objectives
Achieving sufficient supplies of clean and affordable renewable energy for the future is a great societal challenge. However, there is always need for improvement in certain areas like introducing new approaches of fabrication solar cell and producing new applicable materials. The main objective of this thesis is to introduce a new concept of fabrication of nanofiber based solar cell, using femtosecond laser technique. The most parameters that influence this technique have to be studied in detail. Ultra-fast Laser technology with its excellent features for material processing offers many opportunities

17

to make economical manufacturing processes feasible for solar cell production. As a result of this potential impact, the following are explored in the scope of this thesis: 1) Specify and characterize the optical properties of the nanomaterials synthesized through femtosecond laser ablation. 2) Evaluate the effect of laser parameters such as repetition rate, pulse width, laser power, and duration time, on size and the optical properties of the structure produced. 3) Outline the prototype specification and the design of new approach based on nanomaterial sandwich solar cell. The detail results of the illuminated and the dark I-V curves as well as the power conversion efficiency are demonstrated.

1.7 Summary

The application of different nanomaterials commonly used in the third-generation solar cells was presented. The ultra-fast laser processing material was reviewed in detail. This technique improves upon most of the fabrication processes for nanomaterials that use a chemical catalyst, masks or gas background, which significantly increase the cost.

Chapter 2: Background Theories (light absorption and nanoparticles formation)
2.1 Introduction
The light extinction (i.e., scattering and absorption) of nanoparticles and the nanoparticles (NPs) formation will be the main topic of this chapter. The optical properties of nanoparticles are tunable throughout the visible and near-infrared region of the spectrum as a function of nanoparticle size, shape, aggregation state, and local environment [211]. The scattering and absorption of light by metal nanoparticles has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. Research has typically focused on developing a film on a PV surface which can reflect, transmit, or absorb light incidents. The effectiveness of light incidents depends drastically on the properties of the film: a strong visible absorption appears when the size of the particle decreases to nanometer length scale. Metal NPs are commonly used to increase the effectiveness of PV devices because they have optical properties analogous to a dipolar oscillator and exhibit distinct resonances because of the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons, even if their size is smaller than the incident wavelength [73]. However, observing single luminescent and nonluminescent objects (such as molecules or semiconductor quantum dots) is more difficult since it requires detection of very weak light absorption or scattering [74], and time-domain optical response [75]. Key structural parameters (such as aspect ratio, cap-end shape, and volume of the particles) are frequently polydispersed, resulting in a strongly inhomogeneous optical response [74]. A good understanding of these nanoparticle optical features and their effects will lead to the construction of more 21

efficient solar cells, which is the main topic of Chapter 6. The most rigorous theories that describe the extinction spectra of spherical particles of arbitrary size will be highlighted in this chapter.

2.2 Basic Concept and Equations for Light Absorption in Nanoparticles
2.2.1 Lorenz-Mie's Theory
The Lorenz-Mie theory, describing the interaction between a homogeneous sphere and an electromagnetic plane wave, is likely to be one of the most famous theories in light scattering [76]. This theory predicates the optical properties of dispersions of spherical particles with a radius ( ) through expressions for the extinction cross section ( for very small particles with a frequency dependent (), complex dielectric function ( = + ) embedded in a medium of dielectric constant . This can be expressed as: (2.1) This equation predicts the existence of an absorption peak, which occurs in the following conditions: (2.2) In a small metal particle, the dipole created by the electric field of light induces a surface polarization charge, which acts as a restoring force for the free electrons. The net result is that, when the conditions from (2.2) are fulfilled, the long wavelength absorption by the bulk metal is condensed into a single surface plasmon band. )

22

2.2.2 J.C. Maxwell- Garnett's Theory
In 1904, J.C. Maxwell-Garnett [212] attempted another quantitative theoretical description of colors of nanoscopic metal particles. His work is considered integral to the development of traditional descriptions of light: he described how light is propagated as a transverse wave, consisting of electromagnetic radiation with specific wavelengths. One of his most famous contributions is his four partial differential equations, now known as Maxwell's equations, which significantly advanced classical electromagnetic theory. In this approach, metallic particles are supposed to be of spherical shape and are considered to be very small compared to the wavelength of incident light. Dipole interactions between particles can be then taken into account, which was done in the three-dimensional case. Following this theory, using expressions for spherical particle polarizability derived by Rayleigh and Lorenze [212], this research considered the incidence of light of wave-length () on a sphere of metal of radius ( ) to define effective composite optical constants. Through the average

polarization of the nanoparticles and the surrounding medium, the average dielectric function of = was calculated as [76, 77]: (2.3) In this equation, ( is the metal volume fraction, ( ) is the dielectric function of the

surrounding medium, and ( ) is the complex dielectric function of the nanoparticles. When the metal nanoparticle volume fraction is high, equation (2.3) is no longer valid. Under these conditions, effective medium theories are the simplest way to describe the

23

optical response of the system (thin layer). The transmittance (T) of radiation with a frequency through the film can be then calculated as: (2.4) In this equation, is the film thickness and is the reflectance at normal incidence: (2.5) Furthermore, is the absorption coefficient, which can be calculated from we can define the parameters

Finally,

/

and

As Equation (2.4) takes the reflection losses into account, it can be considered as the extinction coefficient of the film.

2.2.3 Kubelka-Munk Theory
The theory of Kubleka-Mulk has found a wide acceptance due to its simplicity in modeling the optical properties of light scattering materials, which assumes that light striking a surface can only scatter in two directions: up and down. The original theory of Kubelka and Munk was developed for light diffusing and absorbing infinitely wide colorant layers [77]. Due to its simplicity in use and its acceptable prediction accuracy, this model has become very popular in industrial applications. The concept is primarily based on the simplified picture of two diffuse light fluxes through the layer, one proceeding downward and the other simultaneously upward.

24

In this theory, the reflectance and transmittance of the thin layer in the medium are and which means the absorption ( and from the -th to will be calculated as: 1 Any

change in

1-th layer will be calculated as [77,78 and 212]: (2.6) (2.7)

There are two assumptions in these equations: 1) If and are the same for and flux, then, the distribution of intensities will be

equal for both. 2) If the sample may be treated as continuous medium, the equation will define the "scattering" coefficient (S) and "absorption" coefficient (K). Hence, the scattering and the absorption coefficient will be calculated as:

S
K This equation takes the limit as: (2.8) (2.9) The reflectance of an infinitely thick layer can be determined as: 0 and leads to K-M differential equations, expressed

(2.10) Solving the K-M equations gives and therefore allows the following calculations: 25

NOTE: The Kubelka-Munk theory is commonly applied to pigment mixture to predict the colour of multi-layer surfaces.

2.2.4 Quantum Theory
Quantum theory can be used to intensively investigate semiconductor behaviour in finite sized regimes. Due to quantum confinement, these materials have many fundamentally interesting and potentially useful optic properties. The first clue in the development of quantum theory came with the discovery of the de Broglie relation in 1923: if light exhibits particle aspects, perhaps particles of matter show characteristics of waves [78]. According to Einstein [79], a particle of light has a definite energy given by E = (quantization of the energy). Many years later, Louis de Broglie postulated ) and a velocity ( ) has an associated wavelength.

that a particle with a mass ( .

The resonant reflection and absorption of light by low-dimensional semiconductor objects is a simple and reliable way to determine exciton parameters. If the light frequency ( ) equals the exciton frequency elastic light scattering and

absorption will intensify the resonance of size-quantized semiconductor objects like

26

quantum wells (QW), quantum wires, and quantum dots (QD) when they are irradiated by light.

2.2.5 Confined System
A confined system is the most applicable tool of quantum theory. In a confined system, the energy of the allowable electronic states increases with the degree of confinement [79]. Quantum confinement effects arise when the confinement dimension is close to the Bohr radius. The familiar result is that the energy is quantized into a value that makes up the energy levels of the system, calculated as: (2.13) In this equation, 1, 2, is the particle mass, ) is the width of the well within

which the particle is confined, and

is Planck's constant. But this confinement effect

is only significant within the Bohr rules. Three distinct categories of confinement can be identified as strong, medium, and weak, according to the relative sizes of the Bohr radius and the potential well. The values of the Bohr radii of electron, hole, and excitons are calculated as: (2.14)

is the relative permittivity,

is the Bohr radius. Since the effective mass is directly related to

the gradient of the E­k curve, the effective mass of the hole and electron will be different in the confined system compared to bulk material systems.

2.2.6 Effective-medium Theory (EMT)
The effective-medium theory (EMT) is a powerful tool for describing the irradiative properties of complex heterogeneous media [81, 84], which has been consistently used to evaluate the optical properties of composite media. The main objective is to calculate the properties of the composite from the known properties of its constituents. More precisely, EMT permits one to identify the average field (or coherent field) propagating inside a random medium, obtained through the generation of the random processes. In several models, the effective permittivity possesses an imaginary part, even though the random medium is lossless. This effective absorption describes the attenuation of the coherent field and permits the evaluation of incoherent scattering.

2.2.7 Surface Plasmon
Surface plasmons arise when a surface is introduced to new modes at the interface and when collective oscillations occur inside the bulk of a metal [118-123]. These modes can be as complex as the interface itself, responding to geometric considerations, surface roughness and the bulk properties of all the materials defining the interface.

28

These modes are known as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), surface plasmons, or just plasmons. These surface waves can be separated further into two categories: surface waves are radiative above the bulk plasma frequency, and below the surface plasma frequency they are confined surface waves. The confined surface waves are often referred to as propagating plasmons. This theory can be used to model the absorbance spectra of nanoparticles solution using the Beer­Lambert­Bouguer law, calculated as: (for liquids) (for gases) In these equations, T is the transmissivity of light through a substance, (2.17) (2.18) and are the is the is the

intensity (or power) of the incident light and the transmitted light, respectively Molar absorption coefficient of absorber, is the distance (bath length),

concentration of absorbing species in the material, ( and

is the absorption cross section,

is the (number) density of absorbers. The transmission (or transmissivity) is

expressed in terms of an absorbance , calculated as: (for liquids) (for gases) (2.19) (2.20)

These equations imply that the absorbance becomes linear with the concentration (or number density of absorbers) respectively). The extinction cross-section (absorption and scattering) is related to the extinction efficiency (for spherical particles) by 29 , where R is the radius and (for liquid and gases,

of the spherical particle. In the following equation, the transmission is expressed in terms of a single particle area: (2.21) In order to predict the absorbance spectra of a solution of particles, we need to know the extinction efficiency of the particles in the solution that is related to the wave length (). This can be found using Mie theory [80, 81]: (2.22) In Mie theory, and are scattering coefficients, is the dimensionless

size parameter, and

is the refractive index of the medium at . According to C. F.

Bohren [9], the total absorbance spectrum of the solution is a weight combination of the absorbance spectra of each particle size, given as: (2.23) In this equation, is the absorbance of the (ith) particle size, is the weight

of the ith particle size in the distribution, and the sum is carried over n total particle sizes in the distribution. Our research combines this equation with the extinction efficiency to get the final equation of absorption as: (2.24) The (number) density of absorbers (N) is now the total number of particles per unit volume in the solution. These elementary calculations reveal a strong dependence on nanoparticle cross-sections for optical absorption and scattering of particle size. According to C.F. Bohren [81], the equations of the cross-sections for absorption and

30

scattering of incident radiation by a spherical nanoparticle (after assuming the particle size is very small compared to the incident wave length) will be: (2.25) (2.26) The size parameter is defined as 2R/, where R is the radius, a is the scattering coefficient and  is the wavelength of light. When a small spherical metallic nanoparticle is irradiated by light, the oscillating electric field causes the conduction electrons to oscillate coherently [81]. When the electron cloud is displaced relative to the nuclei, a restoring force arises from the attraction between electrons and nuclei that results in the oscillation of the electron cloud relative to the nuclear framework. The oscillation frequency is determined by four factors: the density of electrons, the effective electron mass, and the shape and the size of the charge distribution. The collective oscillation of the electrons is called the dipole plasmon resonance of the particle (sometimes denoted as "dipole particle plasmon resonance" to distinguish it from plasmon excitation that can occur in bulk metal or metal surfaces) [117]. For a metal like silver, the plasmon frequency is also influenced by other electrons, such as those in d-orbital, and this prevents the plasmon frequency from being easily calculated using electronic structure calculations. However, it is not hard to relate the plasmon frequency to the metal dielectric constant, which is a property that can be measured as a function of wavelength for bulk metal.

31

2.3 Laser Fundamentals
Albert Einstein has laid the groundwork for laser development as early as 1916. He developed a radiation model involving stimulated absorption, spontaneous emission and stimulated emission. Electrons in the atoms of the lasing material normally reside in a steady-state lower energy level. Through the supply of energy, the electron of an atom can change into an excited state. The majority of the electrons are excited to a higher energy level. Subsequently, it jumps back from a higher-energy to a lowerenergy state as it emits a photon, which is seen as light. However, this transition occurs randomly by spontaneous emission. On the other hand, the theory of stimulated emission requires a resonant photon to pass close enough to an atom. This result in an energy release in the form of a photon having the same energy, frequency, phase, polarization and direction are identical or proportional with the first photon (such as a laser). The emitted light is reflected back and forth between two mirrors through the active medium in the resonator. According to the principal type of operation and construction; there are basically four types of lasers. The gas laser like the heliumneon, Carbon Dioxide and Argon, the solid lasers like Ruby laser, Neodynium YAG, semiconductor, the molecular laser like Eximer Laser and free electron Laser.

2.4 Laser Parameters
2.4.1 Polarization
Polarization is an important optical property inherent in all laser beams. A wave is linearly polarized when the resultant electric field is oscillating in the same direction at 32

all times. Double refraction through birefringent materials --such as in waveplates--are popular for this application. For example, quarter waveplates will result in beam circular polarization by a quarter-wavelength phase shift. Half waveplates may be rotated for s- or p-polarization. For multiple-pass techniques, s-polarization resulted in narrower groves with internal branching. Theoretically, s-polarization will have high reflective losses while p-polarization will absorbed relatively better. As a compromise, quarter waveplates are used for uniform ablation rates in all direction by circular polarization. Plane polarization is a randomly plan polarized light in unknown direction, and may vary with time.

2.4.2 Pulse Duration (Pulse Width)
The most frequently used definition is based on the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the optical power versus time. For calculations concerning soliton pulses (pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects), it is common to use a duration parameter ( ) which is approximately the FWHM duration divided by 1.76, because the temporal profile can then be described as a constant times sech2 (t/). For complicated pulse profiles, a definition based on the second moment of the temporal intensity profile is more appropriate. By modulating a continuous-wave light source, pulses with durations from some tens of picoseconds to arbitrarily high values can be generated. The pulse duration can be measured with the fastest available photodiodes in combination with fast sampling oscilloscopes. Here is an overview on the common prefixes: 1 ms (millisecond) = 10-3s 1 ns (nanosecond) = 10-9s 1 s (microsecond) = 10-6s 1 ps (picosecond) = 10-12s 33

1 fs (femtosecond) = 10-15s 1 as (attosecond) = 10-18s

2.4.3 Pulse Energy
The pulse energy EP is simply the total optical energy content of a pulse i.e., the integral of its optical power over time. The Gaussian feature size `D` is dependent on the pulse energy as follows: (2.27) where `
o`

is the machining spot size ` o` is the pulse energy and `th` is the material

dependant threshold. Additionally, the peak fluence is directly proportional to the pulse energy. By increasing the pulse energy, I is intuitive that material ablation will also increase. As well, the incident light intensity will vary by the laser power P, pulse frequency f` which is the reciprocal of pulse interval t and the laser spot diameter d. (2.28) Consequently, laser power has a proportional impact on the incident light intensity. However, increasing the pulse frequency will reduce the incident light intensity.

2.4.4 Pulse Repetition Rate
The pulse repetition rate (pulse repetition frequency) is the number of emitted pulses per second, or the inverse temporal pulse spacing. Depending on the technique of pulse generation, the repetition rates is ranging from below 1 Hz to more than 100 GHz. Moreover, varying the repetition rate also has a direct impact on the effective number of pulses at the center of the cut as follows:

34

where o is the machining spot radius, f` is the laser repetition rate and  is the piezo scanning speed. It will be shown later that controlling the number of pulses as well as the dwell time has a significant impact on material removal.

2.4.5 Dwell Time
Dwell time, defined as the ratio of full width at half maximum of laser beam and beam scan speed, is found to be a critical and effective knob in laser processing. The dwell time is a direct function of the size of the surface defect and the temperature of the part. For calculation, the dwell time is typically taken as the pulse time for which the beam power is greater than one half its maximum values as: = is the dwell time, the scan speed. (2.30) is

is the beam spot dimension along the direction of travel and

2.5 Nanoparticle formation by ultra-fast laser ablation
Among several methods for nanoparticles generation, such as arc discharge, vapor and electrochemical deposition, laser ablation is an attractive technique because of simplicity in configuration and low operation cost. In general there are two possibilities can be assumed to explain the nanoparticles synthesis: direct cluster ejection from the target or collisional sticking and aggregation in the ablated plume flow [213]. During the laser ablation the material inside the plume evolves through several physical states before condensation. As the laser beam hits the material surface, most of the photons

35

are absorbed by the electrons in the conduction band. Photon energy in the laser beam is transferred to the electrons. Hence, the kinetic energy of the surface electrons increases [188].The kinetic energy of the rapid expansion of vapor produced by laser ablation has been analyzed numerically [188]. It has been found that nanoparticles start to form less than 1 s after the laser irradiation [ 214]. The ablation involves mechanisms that occur simultaneously, such as: non-linear absorption, plasma

formation, shock wave propagation, melts propagation, and resolidification. Most of the laser ablation is discussed within the framework of Zelodovich and Raizer theory of condensation. According to RZ-theory [43, 215], the nanoparticles nucleation rate time for nucleation during phase transformation is calculated as:

2.6 Most General Modeling of the Optical Properties of Nanoparticles
Mathematical and statistical approaches are still the most effective tools for handling coupled absorbing and scattering phenomena in a heterogeneous system for the assessment of light energy absorption in a photo reactor [81]. These models have been driven by the rapid development of many new computational tools. As the optics of nanoparticles are very complex, different classes of models are needed in different situations depending on the size of the particles, density, shape, volume fraction, micro structure, etc. Figure 2.1 gives qualitative illustrations of regions of validity for three different nanoparticle-optics models: 1) the effectivemedium region, 2) the independent-scattering region, and 3) the dependent-scattering region [82, 83]. Homogenous media contain particles much smaller than the wavelength of light, which can be modeled by effective-medium theories. Mie theory can be applied to this system after generic cross sections and scattering matrix elements for arbitrary spheres. In this case, we can conveniently use electrostatics to model the optical properties of the composite material [84]. For larger particles, both scattering and absorption are important, and multiple scattering must be taken into account. In the independent-scattering approximation, the coating material is characterized through 37

effective scattering and absorption coefficients that are obtained by summing up the contributions from each particle. For example, Gruber et al. and H.-Ch et al. [84, 85] used effective medium approximation to simulate the effective optical properties of heterogeneous media. This approximation is restricted to dilute media, so each particle scatters independently of the others, however, the third region lies between the two extremes. In dense media, dependent scattering effects become important. In this case, a full solution of Maxwell's equations for the appropriate structure is necessary [85-87].

Chapter 3: Synthesis of Silicon Nanofibrous Structure
3.1 Introduction
The synthesis, processing and characterization of silicon nanofibrous structures will be the main topic discussed in this chapter. Early research of carbon nanofiber growth (from the 1950s through the 1970s) was prompted by the undesirable formation of carbon deposits in industrial steam cracker tubes used to produce a variety of olefins [88]. The terms "filamentous carbon," "carbon filaments," and "carbon whiskers" were used in the past instead of the current term nanofiber [89]. IIijima (1991) demonstrated that carbon nanotubes are formed during arc-discharge synthesis of C60 [90]. In the past two decade, significant progress has been made with regard to (0D) nanostructures (or quantum dots) [91]. In particular, silicon nanofiber shows promise for use in Si-based devices for optical communication and, combined with thin-film solar cell technology, has great potential to absorb light and generate electrons, which could disrupt the future of grid electricity [92]. The threshold photon energy ( h) of silicon is characteristic of luminescent materials like semiconductors, insulators and isolated molecules. In silicon, the energy band diagrams contain multiple completely filled and completely empty bands. The completely silicon-filled band is close enough to the next higher empty band that electrons can make it into the next higher band, which yields an almost full band below an almost empty band [93]. To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of silicon nanofibrous structures using femtosecond laser ablation (with MHz pulse frequency at room temperature in 39

air) is a new technique [43]. First, the interweaving fibrous nanoparticle aggregates as a byproduct of silicon wafer singulation at Mega Hertz pulse frequency, which shows a degree of self-assembly. Irradiation of a silicon surface using several hundred femtosecond laser pulses with a maximum output power of 16 W (at pulse frequency ranging from 26 kHz to 200 MHz and pulse duration of around 200 fs) results in a quasi-ordered array of fibrous nanostructures with relatively uniformed diameters [158]. Although this irradiation technique did not observe a wide range of variation in size distribution and conical structures (as shown in Figure 3.1), research has found a threshold-like pulse frequency at which fibrous nanoparticle aggregates start to form.

Figure 3.1: Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of typical silicon nanofibrous structure for femtosecond laser. Because the morphology of our microstructures is unique, initial experiments focused on the development of formation mechanisms and the influence of experimental conditions on surface morphology (such as fluence, pulse duration, and polarization). This research was conducted to synthesize semiconductor (silicon) nanomaterials by changing the laser parameters such as pulse frequency, pulse width, fluence, dwell 40

time, polarization and laser power. These parameters were controlled by monitoring feedback on methodology characterization and specification using different nanoscale measuring equipment like Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The main goal is to generate the well-organized, unique, nanostructured and uniform thickness for the silicon nanofibrous structure.

3.2 Femtosecond Laser Ablative Synthesis Mechanism
The interaction of femtosecond laser pulses with different kinds of materials could lead to new basic physical and physic-chemical discoveries relating to quantum properties of matter and new characteristic features of events on ultrashort timescales [94]. Basically, in order to remove an atom from a solid by the means of a laser pulse, one should deliver energy in excess of the binding energy of that atom. Thus, to ablate the material with a short pulse, one should apply larger laser intensity approximate to the inverse proportion of the pulse duration at intensities above 1013 ­ 1014 W/cm 2 [95, 96]. The most important benefit of femtosecond laser pulses lies in the deposit of energy into a material in a very short time period, before thermal diffusion can take place [96] ­ timescales comparable to the natural oscillation periods of atoms and molecules, in the range of femtosecond (1 fs = 10 ­15 s) to picoseconds (1 ps = 10 ­12 s) [97]. Generally, the basic stages during femtosecond laser ablation at high intensities are: (1) carrier excitation, (2) thermalization, (3) carrier removal, and (4) thermal and structural effects [98]. The interaction of the femtosecond laser with metals is different 41

than semiconductors or dielectric. In metals, the electron in the conduction band absorbs photon intensities of 1015 W/cm through the strong electric field (inverse bremsstrahlung) [99]. The absorption is responsible for the generation of a highly nonequilibrium state of excited electrons, which relax through electron-electron collisions on a timescale of typically a few hundred (fs), which is determined by the collision rate. Subsequently, material removal, ablation and plasma formation occur through the energy transfer from the electron subsystem to the atomic lattice [100]. Hence there are two main mechanisms that could control the absorption: the optical one, determined by optical penetration depth (1/), and the thermal one, determined by the thermal penetration depth, which is related to the electron thermal conductivity [101]. Within semiconductors, one-photon excitation generates electron-hole pairs by promoting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band through interband transitions, provided that the photon energy ( h) is higher than the material band gap energy. For high intense laser pulses, one-photon excitation will saturate due to band filling, but multi-photon excitation and free-carrier absorption will create more carriers with increased energy [102]. In semiconductors, the thermal model (which means the hot equilibrated electron bath) equilibrates with the lattice through electron phonon scattering; this, in turn, induces a thermal solid-to-liquid transition on a (ps) time scale. This process may be able to control the absorption as well as the "non-thermal" or "plasma" model, which takes into account the destabilization of the covalent bonds due to the high electronic excitation [102].

42

For dielectrics (e.g., ceramics, SiC, diamond, sapphire, bone, etc) within femtosecond laser pulses (  100 fs), only multi-photon ionization can produce the density of electrons required for breakdown and surface damage. In this case, the resulting ablation of material is determined by the intrinsic properties of the sample (i.e., band gap energy), and the process becomes highly deterministic in contrast to the stochastic nature of the long-pulse technique [103].

3.3 Apparatus and Procedure
The procedure and apparatus for synthesizing silicon nanofibrous structures has evolved since our original experiments. Single crystal silicon wafers are cut precisely using a dice saw for each experiment, typically into 10 mm x 10 mm squares. Each square is then cleaned with dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF). A 2% solution (480 ml water and 20 ml HF 49%) was used to remove native silicon dioxide from wafers. Since this solution acts quickly, one needs to only expose the wafer for a short "dip". The wafer was then removed and rinsed in running distilled water (DI). For last stage, the wafers were blow dried with nitrogen and stored in a clean space (the schematic of the experimental setup is presented in Figure 3.2). The laser source is a direct-diode pumped Yb-doped fibre amplified femtosecond laser system ( = 1030 nm) capable of delivering a maximum output power of 18 W average power at a pulse repetition rate ranging from 200 kHz to 26 MHz The /2 wave plate is used to rotate the polarization direction of linear polarized laser radiation. Samples were attached to a magnetizable sample holder, and then positioned in the center of the magnet to allow for maximum translation. 43

Figure 3.2: Schematic illustration of experimental laser set up. The laser set up is shown in Table 3.1, where the frequency range is well above the threshold frequency for nanoparticle formation. The resulting nanofiber structure and optical properties depend heavily on the parameters of the experiment, including fluence, pulse duration, repetition rate, ambient gas species, ambient gas pressure, and laser wavelength. TEM and SEM also employed as tools for structure observation, which was dependent upon magnification (as shown in Figure 3.3). Each magnification revealed more detail and reveal more structure detail.

3.4 Morphology and Characterization of Silicon Nanostructures
We observed that the formation of fibrous nanoparticles aggregates in silicon started at the second cycle. Below this cycle, aggregates are short and coexist with large amount of molten droplets (silicon particles) because the growth of the fibrous nanostructure is pulse-frequency dependent, which means lower than threshold (see Figure 3.4). Meanwhile, at low power (such as 2 MHz) the large molten droplets will dominate the structured surface. As the pulse-frequency eliminates more of the molten droplets, the nanostructure increases significantly due to the agglomeration of the bulk quantity of nanoparticles created during laser ablation at megahertz pulse frequency. A distinct characteristic of the silicon fibrous nanostructures is that particles are fused and the agglomeration shows a certain degree of organization (figure 3.5), unlike the random stacking of particles observed at femtosecond laser ablation for pulse frequencies in the kilohertz and hertz range.

Figure 3.4: SEM images of the first couple cycles (low No. of pulses) 46

Research has also identified the pulse frequency at which the particle aggregations form is in agreement with the theoretically calculated time to start nanoparticle formation [4]. The mechanism of formation is explained by the well-established theory of vapour condensation induced by ultrafast laser ablation [104]. Furthermore, the nanostructure shows certain degree of self-assembly consisting of rings and bridges. As presented in the previous work [217], these fibrous nanostructures have relatively uniform diameters (50 nm) and without a wide range of variation in size distribution. Figure 3.5 showed the interweaving fibrous nanoparticle aggregations as a byproduct of silicon wafer singulation at different pulse widths.

3.4.1 Effect of Polarization
Polarization has a significant effect on the morphology of the irradiated surface, as shown in Figure 3.6. The generated structure under linear laser beam is completely different from those created with circular laser beams under the same conditions. The outcome of linear polarization will be a first-order diffracted wave parallel to the sample surface. The interference between these waves and the linear irradiation laser beam leads to a periodic variation in radiation intensity profile, which alters the ablation mechanism and hence the resultant of texture alerted [105].

Figure 3.6: SEM images of silicon nanostructure created by laser irradiation in air ambient with (A) a circular polarization laser beam, and (B) a linear polarization laser beam.

3.4.2 Effect of background nitrogen gas
Generally, the presence of background gas has a significant effect on laser-induced nonmaterial formation. The formation of nanoparticles is more complex in the presence of background gas, thus, plume expansion and collisions with gas atoms have to be considered. Background gases, such as H 2, N2, SF6, CL 2 or others, will provide an 48

additional control of structure and composition for the nanoparticles [106, 107]. Our experimental work shows that the uniform silicon nanofibrous structure has been totally changed to mutually cauliflower-like agglomerate with the present of N 2 background gas, as shown in Figure 3.7. This new structure is completely different from the blunt conical spikes or micro-spikes formed on a silicon surface through laser irradiation in a N2 background [108, 109]. The presence of N 2 gas results in silicon nitride enrichment: an amorphous nitrogen-rich hydrogenated silicon alloy (a-SiNx: H) replaces microcrystalline hydrogenated silicon ( c-Si: H) [110], which eliminates the formation of fibrous nanostructure.

When a sample is irradiated in nitrogen, the protective silicon oxide layer is removed through a slow ablation, followed by a rapid ablation that evaporates the underline monocrystal silicon. At the end of the ablation, nitrogen diffuses into the substrate at a very slow rate which is exothermic and could self-accelerate if uncontrolled [111], however, the diffusion gradually slows down as the nitride later eventually covers the substrate surface [112]. This nitrogen diffusion is responsible for the growth of large sized particles and clusters.

3.4.3 Effect of pulse width and pulse frequency
When the high reflectivity phase for laser fluencies exceeds a critical threshold, both pulse width and pulse frequency energies differentiate the fragment geometric shape of the silicon nanofiber structures. With high pulse frequency, the condensation could be in different fractal aggregation, while for lower pulse frequencies the nanoparticles would condense as spherical particles, as shown in Figure 3.8.

3.4.4 Effect of Dwell time
The dwell time (working time) of the femtosecond laser is one of the most important parameters for controlling the modification of the target morphology, which is the ratio of full width at half maximum of laser beam (FWHM) and beam scan speed [113]. Various dwell times (1.00, 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25 ms) were applied for the same repetition rate by using EzCAD© software and all laser power readings were obtained prior to the beam entering the galvoscanner. We used the same laser setting as our team did [114], as shown in Figure 3.9. 50

Figure 3.9: Schematic representation of the laser experimental setup [114] We identified one important phenomenon in particular: as the laser dwell time (interaction time) increases, the size of the fibrous structure increases due to the agglomeration of large number of nanoparticles. The thickness of the deposited fibrous

nanostructure layer (for laser dwell times of 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 ms) was measured using the ZYGO spectral device, as shown in Figure 3.10.

Furthermore, the energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the oxidation of nanoparticles that aggregate in the fibrous structure. The reflection spectrum of the fibrous nanostructure layer ­ with dwell times of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 ms over a visible wavelength is presented in Figure 3.11.

3.5 Optical Properties of Silicon
According to the most rigorous theories [122], when light is scattered by particles which are very small compared to the light wavelengths, the ratio of the amplitudes of the scattered and incident light varies inversely. Figure 3.12 demonstrates the reflectance of unprocessed silicon and nanostructure silicon samples irradiated in air ambient and under N 2 gas. In a confined system, the energy of the allowable electronic states increases with the degree of confinement. The result is that energy is quantized into eigenvalues, hence the energy levels of the system is given by the following relationship: (3.1) In this equation, n=1, 2, 3. . . m is the particle mass, R is the width of the well within which the particle is confined, and h is Planck's constant. The quantum confinement

53

effects are only significant for systems in which the Bohr radius of the exciton is of the order of, or larger than, the size of the confined system.

(d)

Figure 3.12: Intensity Reflection of a) unprocessed silicon, b) treated silicon with different pulse frequency, c) treated silicon with different pulse duration, and d) traded silicon N2 gas. In silicon, an increase in the band gap energy and an associated increase in the probability of radiative transfer is the most immediate consequence of the confinement effect. As the carriers are confined in real space, their associated wave functions spread out in momentum space. This increases the probability of radiative transfer as the electron-hole wave function overlaps. Moreover, the band gap in silicon remains indirect, however, the fibrous nanostructure scatters the confined exciton at the fibre boundaries through incident photons or electrons, which can supply the required momentum for the indirect transition, leading to an increase in light absorption. 54

Campbell et al. (1986) and Richter et al. (1981) developed the first approach that theoretically investigated the consequences of the confinement of phonon spectra, which is usually used to estimate the average diameter of nanocrystals. This approach was employed in our research to explain our observations, which is expressed as [117,116]: (3.2) In this equation, ( ) is the wave factor (expressed in units of constant (which is ~ 5.430 Å for silicon), and is ~4cm-1). The dispersion of the LO phonon is given by the relation: (3.3) In this equation, A=1.714×105 cm-2 and B=1.000×105 cm -2. By using the above equation, we estimated the average dimension of our fibre nanostructure varies from 10 to 70 nm, which is comparable with the average measure for fibre: a diameter of ~ 50 nm. ), (a) is the lattice

3.6 Raman micro spectra measurements
Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique based on the inelastic scattering of monochromatic light, usually from a laser source. Inelastic scattering means that the frequency of photons in monochromatic light changes upon their interaction with a sample. As this Raman intensity is closely related to the nanostructure of crystals, important information is often obtained from these intensity measurements. The Raman

55

intensity is reduced within crystals damaged by ion bombardment, presumably because of the decrease in the Raman polarizability owing to the breaking of bonds and changes in atomic forces and displacements [116]. In our study, this discrepancy has been attributed to generic defects or impurities introduced during particle growth. These defects (or impurities) destroy the translational symmetry of the crystal, which reduce the mean free path of the electron-phonon system, and hence affect the Raman line shape in a manner similar to that observed for structural damage and finite particle size. Figure 3-13A shows the Raman spectra of unprocessed silicon while Figure 3-13B, C, and D demonstrate those nanostructures created at various pulse frequencies and pulse widths. All structured samples have a couple of peaks. The first peak (at 520.9 cm -1) is due to phonons near the illuminated zone. For samples processed in air, the second peak is always centered at 485.5 cm -1 with a line broadening at around 28 cm -1. The intensity remains the same except for samples treated at pulse frequency of 4.0 MHz and pulse width of 714 fs. When the size of particle reduces to the order of nm, the wave function of optical photons will no longer be a plan wave [117]. This localization of wave function leads to relaxation in the selection rule of wave factor conservation; not only for the phonons with zero wave vector q=0, but those with q more than zero will also shift the peak position down and broaden the width of the peak [17]. This confinement in turn will enhance the light absorptance of the fibrous nanostructure. Figure 3-13D shows the Raman spectra measurement of silicon nanostructures created with the presence of nitrogen at different pulse frequencies. Comparing these results with those obtained by nanostructures generated in air, Raman

peaks were further shifted toward the UV and the peaks were broadened. Unlike the samples irradiated in air, those irradiated with the presence of nitrogen gas show a sharp reduction in intensity, which reduces to the minimum frequency of 4 MHz. This 57

result compares well with the reflectance measurement of Figure 3.12D, in which nanostructures generated at 4 MHz give the best absorption. The band gap widening is related to the nitrogen content: as the nitrogen content increases, the weaker Si ­Si bonds will be progressively substituted by the Si­N. The maximum shift in peak and broadening at 4 MHz could be explained by the higher content of nitrogen. Figure 3.13D also shows that the location of the second peak varies with pulse frequency, unlike the nanostructures generated in air for which the second peak is always located at 485.5 cm-1, regardless of the pulse frequency. For a nitride nanostructure, pulse frequency plays an important role in the below-band gap light absorption. Upon irradiation, a hot expanding plume will be generated, containing superheated species traveling at high speed. When the ablated species arrive at the edge of the plume, they react with the background gas to form new species. The potential for reaction is determined by chemistry thermodynamics, which are dependent on pulse energy. High pulse energy results in hotter plume and promotes a more active reaction. As pulse energy increases and pulse frequency decreases, a reaction is expected to be more active; therefore, more nitrogen content can be expected in the deposition created at lower pulse frequencies.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the synthesis process of silicon nanofiber was described, detailing experimental results and analysis to provide a background for the characterization of nanofiber silicon in solar cells. The main priority of these processes is to determine the optimum laser parameters to generate unique silicon nanofiber under the conditions of

58

air and N 2 gas. The experimental results showed that the unique weblike fibrous nanostructure silicon created in air atmosphere was converted to mutually cauliflower like agglomerate in the present of nitrogen gas background. The presence of nitrogen gas during femtosecond laser ablation of silicon changes composition and structure of the synthesized nanomaterials. Both fibrous structures and cauliflower like structures enhance light absorptance significantly. With nitrogen, the nanomaterials show more Raman spectra downward shift and broadening, especially at lower pulsewidth. The next chapter will address metal nanofibrous structure processing using femtosecond laser ablation.

Chapter 4: Synthesis and Characterization of Metal Nanoparticles
4.1 Introduction
The conductive electrons of a small metal particle oscillate collectively if the frequency of the electromagnetic wave is in resonance with the electron oscillation frequency [118]. When a metal particle is illuminated, the free electrons will oscillate with respect to the metal cores, which are schematically shown in Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1: Schematic representation of oscillating free electrons in a metal particle due to an incoming electromagnetic wave [119] Noble-metal nanoparticles, such as Au and Ag, are known to exhibit characteristic optical absorption in the UV-visible region through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) originating from collective oscillations of free electrons. After Gustav Mie (1908) quantitatively described this behaviour [120], these noble metals have been used for optical and opticelectro devices. When metallic nanofiber is irradiated by light, the oscillating electric field causes the electrons to oscillate coherently, as shown schematically in Figure 4.2. These effects are the result of changes in the so-called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [121- 123]. 60

Figure 4.2: Schematic of Plasmon oscillation for nanofiber By controlling the size, shape, and concentration of metal nanoparticles, the transmission of light into the semiconductor can be enhanced via scattering that occurs in the forward direction [124]. Moreover, research has found that the pulsed laser is a convenient tool to control the size and shape distribution of inhomogeneous nanoparticles [125]. In this chapter, we will discuss our experiments with two metal nanoparticles (titanium and aluminum) used as a candidate for solar cell applications.

4.2 Titanium
4.2.1 Introduction
Since 1969, TiO 2 has been recognized as an effective material to demonstrate photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion [126] and is known to be an important element for improving the strength and radiation resistance of oxides, the production of waveguide layers and optical filters, the formation of buried Ohmic contacts in oxides (for fabricating microsensors), and the modification of optical properties of glass 61

window materials (for space and industrial applications) [127]. Titanium dioxide occurs in three crystalline polymorphs: rutile (tetragonal), anatase (tetragonal), and brookite (orthorhombic). Rutile is known to be the most stable phase [128]. Many attempts have been made to enhance its photocatalytic activity by extending light absorption from the ultraviolet (UV) region into the visible region [129] or suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs in TiO 2 [130-132]. Several modification techniques ­ for example, doping with transition metal, non-metal ions sensitizing with organic dyes [133], etc. ­ were used to extend the absorption band to the visible-light region. Asahi et al. [134] claimed that doped nitrogen atoms narrow the band gap of TiO2 and thus make it capable for visible light-driven photo catalysis. However, Ihara et al. [135] insisted that it is the oxygen vacancies that contributed to the visible light activity, and the doped nitrogen only enhanced the stabilization of these oxygen vacancies. Martyanov et al. (2004) also reported this structural oxygen vacancy which causes visible-light photocatalytic activity [138]. Due to the higher electron affinity of TiO 2, as the photo-induced electrons are injected from the dye into the conduction band (CB) of TiO 2, the charge separation takes place at the interfaces between the dye and the TiO 2. Hence, the performance of a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is strongly dependent on the surface area-to-volume ratio afforded by the TiO 2 film. An optimal performance of a DSSC is possible only when the TiO 2 film has a huge surface area-to-volume ratio, which, in turn, is determined by the morphology of the TiO 2 film. The morphology of the TiO 2 film influences dye adsorption, interfacial electron transfer, and carrier transport [139].

62

4.2.2 Experimental setup
In order to obtain the rutile (tetragonal) phase TiO 2 from bulk titanium, different laser parameters were set up under ambient conditions. Four sets of Ti samples (sized 1 cm × 1 cm × 5 mm) were cleaned using RCA-1 for the present experiment. The laser radiation fluence used was 1.75 J cm -2 (which was calculated from equation (5.1) and (5.2) in chapter 5), average power was 13 W, and pulse repetition rate was 2, 4, 8, and 12 MHz. The laser pulse width and laser interaction time used were 214 fs and 5 ms, respectively. The laser beam profile is Gaussian and the beam was focused with a lens of focal length 70 mm. The sample was irradiated with multiple laser spots separated by 20 m using a computer-controlled galvanometer scanning system. The entire experiment was conducted in air under ambient conditions. The samples were used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a spectrophotometer was used to obtain light reflectance situations from 200 to 2200 nm (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL). X-ray diffractgrams (XRD) measurements were performed with a Cu K radiation ( =

0.154184 nm). The diffractgrams were recorded using Bruker detector from 20° to 70°. The energy-dispersive X ray (EDX) analysis and back-scattering micro- Raman analysis were performed at room temperature using an Ar (Argon) laser source of 514.2nm wavelength.

4.2.3 Results and discussion
The most interesting phenomenon observed through the laser ablation was the growth of oxide fibrous nanospheres for the first time. These nanospheres are spherical in shape and well organized, as shown Figure 4.3. Significant differences were observed between the density and the self-assembly of oxide nanospheres at separate pulse frequencies. The density of oxide nanospheres shows a higher degree of self-assembly with a smaller size structure (30 nm) under 12 MHz (Figure 4.3d) when compared to around 85 nm at 2 MHz (figure 4.3a). This difference is characterized by various pulse energies: an increase in pulse repetition rate energy has a more significant effect on grain growth than increasing the laser time interaction rate.

Micro Raman spectra, shows the presence of rutile TiO 2 in titanium nanoparticle aggregate as shown in Figure 4.4 a. The peaks at 240, 440.8 and 612 cm-1 are attributed to the thermodynamically stable rutile phase of TiO 2 [217]. The X-ray diffractgrams of untreated and laser-irradiated samples are presented in Figure 4.4b. The diffraction peaks can be indexed to metallic Ti and its oxides. The broad feature at a low angle in the spectra arises from the amorphous substrate. The fibrous nanoparticle aggregate mainly contains metallic and oxide phases. Therefore, within the resolution of X-ray diffraction, the single-phase character of our thin films is confirmed. The peaks 35.5 , 39.04, and 41.0 can be indexed to TiO, and the peaks 55.0 , 57.25, and 60.1 can be attributed to different diffraction planes of rutile TiO 2 [140,141].

The size distribution of the nanoparticles in the aggregate (30 ­90 nm) can be explained from the different plume components in the femtosecond laser irradiation of metals, which allows the energy deposition to move into the target well before the target expansion begins, effectively decoupling these two stages of the process. In other words, smaller particles are attributable to nucleation and condensation of vapour in the plasma plume [142]. As the pulse repetition rate an increase, a smaller particle size is produced (Figure 4.3d). The average particle size can be estimated from the Scherrer equation [143]. The following equation is valid with free stress particles: (4.1) In the Scherrer equation, r is the particle size,  is the X-ray wavelength, B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, and  is the diffraction angle. From the diffraction peak in Figure 4.4b, the average particle size was estimated to be about 28.4 nm for the as-grown TiO 2 nanospheres at 12 MHz pulse repetition rate, and about 84.6 nm for the TiO2 nanospheres created at 2 MHz pulse repetition rate. Detail of calculation was found in [218]. These calculations are extremely close to our experimental results, which also align with the reflectance measurement (see Figure 4.6), in which nanostructures generated at 12 MHz give the best light absorption. In the Scherrer equation, r is the particle size,  is the X-ray wavelength, B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, and  is the diffraction angle. From the diffraction peak in Figure 4.4b, the average particle size was estimated to be about 28.4 nm for the as-grown TiO 2 nanospheres at 12 MHz pulse repetition rate, and about 84.6 nm for the TiO2 nanospheres created at 2 MHz pulse repetition rate. These calculations are extremely close to our experimental results, which also align with the 67

reflectance measurement (see Figure 4.4d), in which nanostructures generated at 12 MHz give the best light absorption. It is widely believed that the activity of the optical properties of the microstructured titanium surfaces is critically dependent on the presence of defects (including oxygen vacancies) on the surface and in the subsurface region [219]. Moreover, the oxidation process, the chemical composition and the resulting microstructure are far more complex [144, 145]. This oxidation will lead to a modified crystallographic structure and lattice parameters which may increase the porosity [146, 147]. The thermodynamically stable rutile phase of TiO2 is completely different than the surface oxidation of the nanostructure when it comes into contact with ambient air. The surface oxidation of nanostructures increases after an extended period of exposure in air; this steady rutile phase of TiO 2 serves itself as an additional antireflection coating, which enhances the light transmitted. Both the nano scaled TiO2 particles and the high intensity of the TiO 2 nanospheres should afford a large surface area-to-volume ratio, which is critical for the optimal performance of dye-sensitized solar cells: a large surface area-to-volume ratio allows a large amount of dyes to be adsorbed on the surfaces of the TiO2 nanoparticles [148]. Instead of doping, sputtering deposition, or ball milling, rutile (TiO 2) nanospheres particles were created by irradiated bulk Ti using a femtosecond laser at ambient condition, which is attractive because it has several advantages over other processes, including: 1) the ability to produce materials with a complex stoichiometry and a narrower distribution of particle size, 2) reduced porosity, and 3) heightened

68

control over the level of impurities [148]. The absorptance of the fibrous nanostructure depends on its intensity. This is attributed to the increase in surface area, which in turn increases the absorption of incident light. This method is a promising technique for growing nanocrystalline films of TiO2, or other oxide semiconductors to be used for DSSC applications.

4.3 Aluminum
4.3.1 Introduction
Plasmonics is currently one of the most fascinating and fast-moving fields of photonics [149]. A variety of approaches had been developed and examined to exploit the optical properties of metallic and dielectric nanoparticles (particularly those associated with surface plasmon polaritons resonances) to improve the performance of photo detectors and photovoltaic devices [149, 150]. Surface plasmon resonance aligns with the conduction electrons oscillation, which rises in response to the alternating electric field of an incident electromagnetic radiation [123, 81 and 118]. The mode of oscillation can be controlled by the shape and size of nanoparticles. In turn, the optical properties such as scattering or absorptance can be altered by [81]. Since Bethe (1944) published a physical review article titled the "Theory of Diffraction by Small Holes" [151], many researchers have investigated the optical transmission properties of nano-hole arrays with various metals and dielectrics [152-156]. Yu et al was employed silicon-on-insulator photodetector structures to investigate the influence of nanoparticle periodicity on coupling of normally incident light into the silicon-on-insulator waveguide. An enhancement of photocurrent by factors as large as 69

5-6, was obtained due to the local surface plasmon resonance [150]. For instance, Kelly et al, (2003) used the discrete dipole approximation method (DDA) for solving Maxwell's equations for li ght scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment [119]. Maier (2007) presented a study that quantified nanostructure properties (i.e., local surface plasmon resonance energy, dephasing/lifetime, total cross-section, and contribution of scattering and absorption of light) of Aluminum (Al), with supported nanodisks as the model system [118]. Many candidate metals have been examined for the generation of local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Most of them are noble metals, including gold, platinum, and silver. Aluminum is a particularly interesting material from both fundamental and applicable point of view. It is an abundant and cheap material compared to the noble metals [118]. More importantly, aluminum can fulfill the requirement for LSPR, which needs large negative real parts and a small imaginary part of the dielectric function (i.e., negative dielectric permittivity < 0) [81, 155]. Therefore, aluminum

nanostructures are more likely to support long-lived LSPRs with high optical crosssections, and these excitations will be tunable over a wide energy range. S´amson (2009) provided a detailed discussion of the basic features of the plasmon resonances of aluminum nanoparticles and the free-standing aluminum hole arrays, highlighting their differences from Au and Ag nanoparticles [149]. Traditionally, nano-hole arrays are fabricated by beam lithography, evaporation and chemical catalytic methods. This work proposed a new approach. Ultrafast laser is used to ablate the surface of bulk aluminum. The high intensity laser pulse delivered at

70

Mega Hertz frequency simultaneously creates periodic micro-hole array and large deposition of nanostructured aluminums.

4.3.2. Setup for experiments
Direct diode- pumped Yb-doped fiber oscillator/amplifier ( = 1064 nm) system capable of producing a variable energies up to 18.5 W at a pulse repetition frequency between 25 kHz and 200MHz was used to drill the periodic micro-hole arrays . Samples are bulk aluminum plates of 10 area and 2.5 thicknesses. They were

cleaned and electro polished by 2%HF before the ablation. The linearly polarized irradiation laser beam of 1030 nm wavelength was focused by a concave lens of 12.5 mm focal length. The pulse frequencies were set at 4, 8, 12, 26 MHz and dwell times at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and1 ms. The entire experiment was conducted under air ambient. The morphology of all ablated samples was examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersion X-ray (EDX) analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The light reflectance/absorption situations from 200 nm to 2200 nm were test by a spectrophotometer.

4.3.3. Observations
4.3.3.1 Morphology of aluminum nanostructures SEM micrographs of the irradiated surfaces around the micro-hole arrays are shown in figure 4.7. The periodic micro-holes (of diameter around 10m) start to form with low pulse frequency of 4MHz (see Figure 4.8).

The nucleation and generation of nanostructure features inside the micro-hole can be explained by Raizerzelodive (RZ) theory'. It's the most applicable theory of dynamic condensation of expanding vapor through ultra-fast laser ablation. This theory was outlined in more detail in [188].The structures have a self-assembled web-like appearance with high dwell time, as shown in Fig 4.11.

Figure 4.11: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Aluminum nanoparticle The thickness of the fibrous nanostructure layer will increase as a function of the laser dwell time. Thicker depositions have larger surface area, as illustrated in previous work [158]. Electro dispersion X-ray (EDX) revealed that the aluminum content was accompanied with oxide content after irradiation, as shown in Figure 4.12. This surface oxidation of nanostructures increases after an extended period of exposure to air. The formation of a thin 2-3 nm native oxide layer on an Al surface is almost instantaneous after its exposure to (humid) air [44]. The oxidation process, as well as the chemical composition and the resulting microstructure, are far more complex as a result [144, 145]. 74

Figure 4.12: EDX analysis of the irradiated aluminum surface 4.3.3.2 The optical properties of aluminum nanostructures The optical properties of structured aluminum surfaces are of great interest in comparison to the properties of unstructured surfaces because the absorptance of structured aluminum changes over a broad range of visible wavelengths. The reflectance intensity characterized by the pulse frequency energy and dwell time is shown in Figure 4.13.

Figure 4.13: Reflection as a function of wavelength with different dwell time

75

Basically, if the holes are arranged in a two-dimensional structure within a conductive thin layer, then the transmissivity is dramatically increased by over three orders of magnitude [160]. All irradiated samples show high absorption intensity in comparison to unprocessed samples (see Figure 4.14).

Figure 4.14: Reflection as a function of wavelength with different dwell time

4.3.4 Discussion The incoming light is diffracted by the periodic hole array texture, which has closely spaced diffraction resonances where the absorption is maximized (see Figure 4.15) [162, 221]. The maximum intensity for the optical transmission of the non-hole array depends on periodicity, as defined by the following equation: (4.2)

76

In this equation, (

) is the periodicity of holes,

and

are the dielectric constants

of the incident medium, and i and j are the integers expressing the scattering mode indices [163,164]. Generally, plasmon represents the collective oscillations of electrons, while the surface plasmon polarizations are surface electromagnetic waves that propagate in a direction parallel to the metal/dielectric (or metal/vacuum) interface. However, since the wave is on the boundary of the metal and the external medium (for example, air or any dielectric materials), these oscillations are very sensitive to any change of this boundary, such as the absorption of molecules to the metal surface. The coupled light ­ electron oscillations on the surface of noble metal (platinum, silver, and gold) structure are phenomena described by Maxwell's and Mie constitutive equations.

Figure 4.15: Reflection as a function of wavelength with different dwell time Making the assuming the particle size is very small compared to the incident wave length, the Scat-Lab Mie-theory software package (using equations 2.25 &2.26) was 77

employed to predict the cross sections for absorption and scattering of the aluminum nanoparticles. Consequently, the absorption cross-section ( ) becomes the dominant process,

accompanied by a large increase in the electromagnetic field amplitude in a volume within a particle size less than the incident light wavelength. According to the mathematical calculations, the maximum aluminum nanoparticle size should be less than 110 nm (the intersecting point of the two curves, as shown in Figure 10. The mean particle size of the aluminum nanostructure is measure to be 50 nm, which is below the critical particle size given in Figure 4.16, which suggests that when light passes through the nanofibrous deposition absorption dominates over the scattering.

Figure 4.16: Theoretical calculations of Qsca and Qabs efficiency with different particle sizes Generating a thin homogeneous layer of aluminum nanofibrous structure on the bulk of an Al substrate will be advantageous to get an identical reflective index, which will result in a homogeneous external field that induces a dipole in the nanoparticles. 78

Otherwise, when the nanoparticle is supported on a substrate whose refractive index is different from that of the ambient, the field acting on the particle will no longer be homogeneous due to the image dipole field that is induced in the substrate [165]. Consequently, the laser parameters (dwell time and repletion pulse energy) will significantly affect the high reduction in reflectance intensity due to increased nanofibre creation. Hence, the Al-nanofibrous structure response caused by the dipole oscillation of localized surface plasmons will increase the metal extinction for incident light. This extinction enhances the local electromagnetic field near the nanofibrous layer at surface plasmon resonance and the scattering cross section for off resonant light [184]. In addition, when nanoparticles are sufficiently close together, interactions between neighboring particles arise. Therefore, when the long dwell time has created an intensive quantity of homogenous nanofibrous structures, the dipole created by the electric field of light will induce a surface polarization charge, which effectively acts as a restoring force for the free electrons.

4.4 Summary
Remarkable size-dependent optical properties of Al & Ti nanoparticles (related to the generation of Mie resonances [167] and to quantum size effects [168]) make them very attractive for use in optics, as well as electronic biotechnological applications. Noblemetal nanoparticles, such as Au and Ag, are known to exhibit characteristic optical absorption in the UV-visible region caused by the surface Plasmon resonance (SPR), which originates from collective oscillations of free electrons [176]. Other than noble metal, common metals like Fe, Al, Cu, and Ti have been investigated extensively for a 79

broad range of potential applications [169]. It was found that the as-grown nanocrystalline TiO 2 films were of rutile crystal structure, which results in an inexpensive way of creating a fibrous TiO 2 nanostructure layer on the material surface that has steady morphology as well as optical properties. Our research method is a promising technique to effectively grow nanocrystalline films of TiO 2, ZnO, or other oxide semiconductors to be used for DSSC applications. A significant reduction in light reflection of Al nanofiber has been observed with long working time (dwell time) because of more nanofiber creations, which serve to increase the metal extinction for incident light. Although pulse frequency may not have a significant effect on reducing light reflectance, high pulse frequency conclusively shows a certain degree of reflectance down shift. This is due to reducing laser power energy with long pulse frequency, which generates more nanoparticles as well as less particle size. Our experiments have demonstrated a strong correlation to theoretical calculations. These Al-nanofiber structures that we have developed are highly recommended for thin film solar cells. The next chapter will deal with the synthesis of gold-silicon nanofibre.

Chapter 5: Synthesis of Gold-Silicon Nanostructures and the Characterization of their Optical absorption
5.1 Introduction
The identification of inexpensive and easily processed material will be an important challenge for nanostructure researchers aiming to develop an advanced solar cell. Several articles have focused on enhancing the spectral absorbance of solar cells made from nanostructured material by modifying the materials or by improving the hole and electron transport [171] through alternative wide-band-gap semiconductor materials [172]. Many researchers have studied silicon nanowire, metal nanowire, nanotubes and nanorods, which enabled the development of solar cells with the ability to decouple the light absorption from the direction of carrier transport [173-176]. Due to the high surface area and the excellent optical properties of nanoparticles, other research has focuses on dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) [176-178]. Overall, the application of nanofiber structures in solar cells is the most promising method to improve efficiency of PV technology. Basically, metal nanoparticles exhibit remarkable properties that depart from their bulk material counterparts due to the large surface area-to-volume ratio, high surface energy, and spatial confinement. For instance, gold nanoparticles exhibit a strong absorption peak near the 520 nm wavelength that cannot be observed in bulk material due to surface plasmon oscillation modes of conduction [179]. Properties such as quantum confinement, surface plasmon resonance, enhanced catalytic activity, and

81

super para magnetism have been observed in nanomaterial such as gold nanoparticle [180]. Laser scribing, laser patterning [181] and laser-induced ablation have been known to act as an alternative physical method for nanofabrication. Compaan et al. (1997) has used very narrow scribe widths and superior profiles for many of the materials involved with thin-film PV [182]. Rajeev et al. (2004) tried to increase the metal absorption using a four beams interference pattern to create hole-array structures near the surface of the cell [183]. Nakayama et al. (2008) investigated the effects of plasmon scattering on absorption and photocurrent collection in the prototype GaAs solar cells, decorating them with size-controlled Ag nanoparticles using masked deposition through Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates [184]. In addition, Kume et al. (1997) investigated the light emission from surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) mediated by metallic nanoparticles system, consisting of Ag nanoparticles placed very close to an Al surface which was prepared by depositing Ag film on Al film [185]. Novelty et al. (2009) [186] have investigated the effect of the impact of a UV laser beam on thermally evaporated black gold and gold thin films with respect to their optical and structural properties. He found that the absorptivity of black gold film decreased during an increasing number of laser pulses. The web-like and network morphology structure is the main difference between the nanofibers synthesized by femtosecond laser and other nanowire, nanotube and nanorod structures in solar cell applications. Nanowire, nanotube and nanorod morphology could provide direct conduction paths for the electrons and allow the light absorption to decouple from the direction of the carrier transport (along the

82

longitudinal direction only), while the web-like network structure of nanofiber will enhance the anisotropy with a large variety of morphology. Moreover, the dense network of nanofiber can provide a high surface area around 104 times that of untreated surfaces. In the present study, we used a particular femtosecond laser setting to generate a nanofibrous structure on a gold-silicon wafer. Different numbers of laser cycling were used to synthesize the nanofibrous structure with various dwell times. A spectroradiometer was used to measure the reflectance to investigate the couplings of incident electromagnetic irradiations over the broad band wavelength range. The new structure reveals a high reduction in visible light reflection compared with unstructured gold-silicon substrate.

5.2 Experiments
A thin gold film of thickness (200 nm) was deposited onto 0.02 ( .cm) p-type silicon (100) wafers, using an evaporator (E-beam) in the AMPEL Nanofabrication laboratory at the University of British Colombia (UBC). Four sets of these gold-silicon samples of size 10 mm × 10 mm were cut precisely by a dice saw for use in the present experiment. In order to obtain a large number of nanoparticles for analysis without damaging the surface of the target, we increased the laser cycles gradually (2, 3, 4 and 5 cycles) using a specific experimental setup. This technique may provide an efficient way to generate nanoparticles for any composition (Au-Si) under ambient conditions. The laser source is an all-diode-pumped, direct-diode-pumped Yb-doped fibre oscillator/ amplifier system capable of producing variable pulse energies up to 10 mJ at

83

a pulse frequency between 200 kHz and 25 MHz (average power varies between 020W). Arrays of microvias were drilled into a post gold-silicon wafer and a computer was connected to the laser system to control the laser beam, which hits the sample surface 40 40 spots in sequence. The samples were then characterized using scanning electrical microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, EDX analysis and light reflectance situations from 200 nm to 2200nm, which were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, Florida, USA).

5.3 Results and discussions
5.3.1 Mechanism and characterization of nanoparticles aggregation
The basic mechanism of laser ablation for noble metal like gold could be explained in terms of the dynamic formation mechanism postulated by [183-186]. In other words, a dense cloud of gold atoms (plume) was accumulated in the laser spot of the gold target during the course of ablation. This core was made of a number of small gold atoms that were aggregated randomly due to the density fluctuation to form embryonic nanoparticles. Even when the ablation process had been terminated at the end of the cycle, the aggregation continued at a significantly slower growth rate in the coming new cycle, until all atoms in the vicinity of the embryonic nanoparticles were depleted. As both ablated atoms and embryonic nanoparticles diffuse through the plasma formation to form larger clusters, this consecutive nanoparticle growth was slow, random, and eventually eliminated, as shown in Figure 5.1.

84

Figure 5.1: TEM/EDX show a dense cloud of gold atoms (plume) was firstly assembly in different laser spot of the gold target. For the bulk silicon ablation by femtosecond laser, we used the hydrodynamic theoretical model [187-189]. In this model, the nanoparticles form through a mechanical fragmentation of a highly pressurized fluid undergoing rapid quenching during expansion in the vacuum. Basically, increasing femtosecond laser pulses on a solid target significantly reduces or a completely removes the metal, a direct consequence of the laser pulse being much shorter than the heat diffusion time [192,194]. Moreover, in femtosecond laser ablation of thin films, the morphology feature is determined by the maximum laser fluence, which must exceed a certain threshold value to cause an irreversible change in the surface. Due to different laser interaction times for metal and semiconductors, the nanoparticle aggregation of gold deposited on silicon is different than through bulk metal ablation. Firstly, we observed that the formation of nanoparticles aggregates in gold-silicon started at a second cycle (pulse shooting). Until these cycles, the formation

85

of fibrous nanoparticles aggregates was not evident. Below this cycle, aggregates were short and coexisted with a large amount of molten droplets, as shown in Figure 5.2.

Figure 5.2: SEM image of gold-silicon substrate irradiated with low cycles As the dwell time (fs) and the number of pulses increase, the amount of molten droplets reduces and the aggregates grow longer, and finally form unique and uniform fibrous structures (see Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3d shows a typical web-like fibrous nanostructure formed due to the agglomeration of the bulk quantity of nanoparticles created during laser ablation at high cycle and high working time. Moreover, the fibrous nanostructures have relatively uniformed diameters (around 50 nm) and we did not observe a wide range of variation in size distribution. All particular nanoparticles merge to form smooth compact aggregates [185,190]. This unique nanofibrous structure results due to an increase in the number of laser pulses applied to the same spot; hence, the ablation threshold reaches low values compared with the low number of laser pulses [189].

86

Figure 5.3: SEM images of morphology transition with different cycles. A) Less than 2 cycles, B) up to 2 cycles, 3) 4 cycles, and D) 5 cycles

Experimental results show that the minimum required cycles to observe nanoparticles aggregates is dependent on dwell time and the amount of laser shots. We paid attention to the morphology and structural properties, as well as induced changes in optical properties, which occur after the laser beam interaction with the gold thin film. Such numbers of cycles lead to fibrous nanoparticle aggregates gradually and gold-silicon constitute fibrous structure could be controlled through these number of cycles.

87

The laser interaction time used for the nanostructure generation of silicon was very short (around 0.10 ms), which led to the conclusion that the silicon nanostructures will be generated before gold nanostructures at the low cycle [191]. After a particular number of laser pulses, the temperature will be gradually rise because of the cumulative heating from the first few laser pulses; thereafter, the molten material and plasma is maintained by successive pulses, which is when the gold nanostructure will begin to form. It is reasonable to deduce that Au-Si fibrous nanoparticle aggregations could be generated at different times. The transfer process is controlled by electron ­ phonon relaxation time, which is strongly material-dependent and continues for several picoseconds until thermal equilibrium is reached [184-190]. It is believed that the mechanism that forms the nanoparticles could be explained in terms of the fragmentation model assumed by [191, 187] (in the case of Si). This model predicts that the rapid transfer of energy from the carriers to the lattice matter could produce a superheated fluid pressure that leads to a material ejection directly in the form of nanoparticles, unless the critical local expansion dynamics dominate the initial phase transition, leading to the direct fragmentation and ejection of the molten target material [192]. Furthermore, because the silicon density is lighter than gold and a very large amount of the laser pulse energy is deposited in a very thin layer close to the surface, the material is rapidly carried away from the surface, leaving behind less-excited material underneath, which does not significantly ablate at longer time scales [193]. The tight-binding model used by Lukyanchuk et al. [188] revealed that the transverseacoustic phonons of Si become unstable if more than approximately 9% of valance

88

electrons are excited into the conduction band through laser ablation. These photons will destroy the symmetries of the silicon's diamond structure, leading to rapid melting of the crystal. Moreover, the fibrous nanostructures form on silicon at fluence well below the ablation threshold [186]. Thus, the formation of gold nanoparticles is more complex and the model of aggregation in the ablated plume flow can explain the nanoparticle synthesis [195]. In this model, the ultrafast laser pulses heat the target without changing its density, and then the rapid expansion and cooling of this solid density matter results in nanoparticles synthesis [196]. The accumulative ablation threshold fluence

significantly dominates the gold nanoparticle aggregation. The average threshold laser fluence is calculated using the equations (4.2) and (4.3). At a lower repetition rate (2MHz), much higher fluence is delivered at 0.82 J/c m 2 per one pulse and around 0.30J/cm 2 per one pulse for the high repetition rate (26MHz). The low fluence energy in the range (0.30- 0.80J/cm2) per one pulse will not cause massive damage to the gold surface at once, but becomes more effective after many cycles. This is called the phenomenon of "aging" in the material [197]. The most interesting phenomenon we observed is that the growth of the silicon fibrous nanostructure begins first, followed by gold nanoparticle formation, till it consists of equal content ( 50% of Si and Au) at the third and fourth cycle, when the gold nanoparticles consequently dropped at the high cycle. The content was traced through the EDX analysis (see Figure 5.4). Moreover, this gold-silicon constituent behaves in the same manner at different dwell time, as shown in Figure 5.5.

89

90

Our explanation of the low content of the gold nanoparticle within higher cycles than Si content was developed through the removal of the all gold film layer with high fluence [188] and the process of penetrating the ablation plume to reach the Si substrate.

5.3.2 Light reflectance
The nanofibrous structure features significantly influence the optical properties, which can differ considerably from those of bulk materials. This type of structure enhances the optical absorption due to a surface plasmon excitation in metal nanoparticles [185]. The micro-nano scale surface roughness of the treat substrate could also increase the light absorption due to the multiple reflections in the micro-cavities and through the variation of light incidence angles. Metal surfaces with roughness on the scale of the optical wavelength are found to have a strong coupling with the incident light, and become colored due to the selective surface plasmons absorption. In order to investigate the samples absorption behaviour in the visible region, we employed the spectroradiometer with a broad wavelength range of 250-1200 nm, which measured the integrated reflectance spectra (see Figure 5.6). The reflectance of an un-irradiated gold-silicon sample shows high reflectance intensity (around 4000 a.u). The reflected intensity was reduced from 4000 a.u. on the untreated sample to less than 500 a.u. on a substrate covered by nanostructures. It was observed that the reflectance decreases significantly with laser cycles for wavelengths that correspond to radiation in the visible range (250-1250 nm). This reduction results from the fibrous nanostructure reduction size, the fibrous nanostructure layer thickness [198], and the agglomeration of large number of nanoparticles, which play an 91

important role for the decreased reflection of visible radiation. The fibrous nanostructure increases the surface area by more than an order of magnitude, which leads the radiation to pass through a long way before it is reflected back. Therefore, a photon that hits the structured surface is likely to undergo more than one reflection before leaving the surface.

Figure 5.6: Measured integrating reflectance spectra, A) 0.25ms, B) 0.5ms and C) 1.0 ms Furthermore, the spectra exhibit a characteristic lower peak and a tail portion of a broad band extending toward the UV-wavelength range. The width of the 519 nm peak is broadened and the height is lowered by introducing more laser shots. This 92

spectral change indicates that the diameters of the nanoparticles are reduced more under irradiation of the laser with a higher dwell time and more laser shots [198]. Moreover, when nanoparticles are sufficiently close together, interactions between neighboring particles arise. In other words, when the long dwell time has created an intensive quantity of unique and homogenous nanofibrous structure, the dipole created by the electric field of light induces a surface polarization charge, which effectively acts as a restoring force for the free electrons [198].

5.4 Summary
In this chapter, a thin gold layer coated on silicon substrate was irradiated using different laser mechanism. The number of cycles (pulses) was gradually increased. The nanoparticles generation of this conductor-semiconductor substrate reveals different mechanism. The nanoparticles agglomeration starts with silicon followed by the gold nanoparticles and this is due to the different density and melt temperatures. The minimum required cycles to observe nanoparticles aggregates is dependent on dwell time and the amount of laser shots. The formation of nanoparticles aggregates in goldsilicon started at a second cycle (pulse shooting). Until these cycles, the formation of fibrous nanoparticles aggregates was not evident. The agglomeration of large number of nanoparticles, play an important role for the decreased reflection of visible radiation. Moreover, the high surface area leads the radiation to pass through a long way before it is reflected back.

Chapter 6: Fabrication and Evaluation of a Prototype Solar Cell
6.1 Introduction
A new approach to develop a traditional silicon single crystal photovoltaic technology has been devised by inserting a thin nanofibre layer of Si between p-i-n single homojunction silicon cells to fabricate a novel nanostructured sandwich solar cell. This nanofibrous Si layer (which works as a depleted region) was synthesized using MHz ultrafast laser material processing in air at ambient conditions. Basically, we are investigating the generation, specification and characterization of a nanofibrous structure with improved light absorption and charge generation properties. In general, a depleted region of mobile carriers (hole-electron pairs) is formed at the pn junction of silicon single crystal upon contact. The depletion layer plays a significant role in photovoltaic power conversion efficiency because the efficiency of photocurrent generation depends on the balance between: 1) charge carrier generation, 2) recombination, and 3) transport charge. All of these factors are affected by the depletion region. The thickness of this region is one of the parameters of a solar cell that determines the electrical and photovoltaic photoelectric characteristics. It fluctuates with light intensity. Such fluctuation affects the stability of output current and limits the efficiency of conversion. A depletion layer with even thickness throughout the PN junction at an optimized value will raise the conversion efficiency

94

and stabilize the output voltage. So far there is no attempt has been reported to address this limitation. We are learning how to exploit these results to create a structure of materials with new richness of optical or electronic properties as well as specific functionality, working toward applying this structure to create novel nanomaterial based solar cells. For example, PV materials could be made into p-type and n-type configurations to create the necessary electric field that characterizes a PV cell. There is extensive research on light trapping and manipulation techniques, but most of these studies were focused on the deposition of metal nanomaterials with well-defined geometrical shapes (e.g., solid or hollow spheres, dots, prisms, rods, tubes, and wires) on fabricated p-n crystalline Si solar cells [199-204]. Other efforts have been conducted to investigate surface structuring and micromorph techniques to improve conversion efficiency [205207]. The main difference between these techniques and the sandwich solar cell is the buried nanofibre layer underneath the p side. In this approach, a femtosecond laser irradiated the type silicon under ambient conditions and a layer of nanofibre a few

manometers thick was synthesized on this surface. The p-type silicon was implanted by diffusion over the type silicon to form a p-n single homojunction. Hence, the Si

nanofibre works as a depletion region in the p-n junction (see Figure 6.1). The most interesting phenomenon we observed was the cross link between the laser parameters and spectral light absorption, which in turn improves solar cell efficiency. The new concept of a sandwich solar cell has a maximum short circuit current ( 16.21mA/cm 2, an open circuit voltage ( ) of

) of 0.95 V and a maximum efficiency of

12.1%. These results represent a reasonable improvement of 1-2% efficiency compared

95

to other micromorph photovoltaic. On the other hand, the new technique is capable of nanostructuring under ambient conditions without using any catalyst. It is a single-step technique and the precursors are common materials. Also, the new technique generates intact web-like nanostructures with the ability to control the size of the nanostructures by properly adjusting the laser parameters [208].

6.2 Sandwich structured p-n crystalline silicon solar cell: conceptual design
Basically, the depletion region or (space-charge) width (w) of the conventional crystalline-silicon based solar cells is consisting of, the partial space-charge widths in the n-type and p-type. This width (w) can be determined as [222]:

is the space-charge region in n -type silicon,

is the space-region of p-type silicon,

is the built-in electrostatic potential. It is calculated by integrating the electric field throughout the space-charge region and applying the boundary conditions, 96 is the

semiconductor dielectric constant and concentration of acceptor,

is the permittivity of the vacuum.

is electric charge .

For crystalline Si, the semiconductor dielectric constant of the vacuum

= 11.7 and the permittivity

= 8.854x10-14 F/cm and the electric charge =1.602×10-19 C.

From equation (1) it is clearly that, the width of the depletion region is significantly depending on the doping concentration and the external voltage applied [223, 224]. The magnitude of the external voltage applied to a p-n junction will alert the electrostatic potential across the space-charge region [223]. Hence, the reverse-bias voltage applied will results in a wider space-charge region and it decreases as forward-bias applied, and this is due to the potential barrier across the junction [224]. The space region width variation will disturb the balance between the forces responsible for diffusion (concentration gradient) and drift (electric field). The unchangeable width of the space region was achieved by generating a thin layer of nanofiber on the n-type using femtosecond laser technique. This layer between the n-type and p-type showed a steady current-voltage output through the solar cell illumination. The high surface area with certain degree of porosity of the nanofibrous layer will enhance the excitation (hole/electron), and mobility of majority carriers, thus increase the conversion efficiency. Moreover, this layer acts as a functional separation layer which ensures that holes and electrons are injected only into the specifically desired holes in the n-type and electrons in the p-type. Also, when the charge carriers are not separated from each other in a relatively short time they will be annihilated in a process that is called recombination and thus will not contribute to the energy conversion.

6.3 Prototype fabrication
N-type double-side polished Si (100) float zone substrates (with resistivity o f 1.2 -cm and thickness of 300 m) were purchased from University wafer Inc. The samples were cleaned by the RCA-1 (200ml ID water mixed with 40 ml Ammonium hydroxide and 40 ml Hydrogen peroxide ­ the mixed was warmed up to 75 C ) to remove metal ions, organic residue and films from silicon wafer. The wafer was cut for samples that were 1 x 1.5 cm using a dicing saw. To switch the silicon type to type silicon, the

antimony (Sb) was used as a free electron; we believe that the Sb would diffuse through a purely vacant mechanism with dominating. The Sb has a large

tetrahedral radius of 0.13 nm versus a radius of 0.118 nm for silicon, giving 1.15 mismatches and creating strain in the silicon lattice [205]. Antimony (Sb) is the most frequently used n-type doping during crystal growth and considerably reduces the crystallization temperature of amorphous Si through metal-induced crystallization [8, 199-203 and 205-207]. A femtosecond laser irradiated technique was used for irradiation of the type silicon under ambient conditions and a few nanometers

thick layer of nanofibre was synthesized on this surface. The ( P) type silicon was implanted by diffusion over the N- type silicon to form a p-n single homojunction. Hence, the Si nanofibre works as a depletion region in the p-n junction. The rear-side of solar cells require a surface passivation layer and local contacts that cover only a small area to achieve high-energy conversion efficiencies [122]. After soaking the back side of the samples with dilute HF to remove the oxide and to ensure a good metal-toSi contact, evaporation the Al (0.20 to 0.26 um) was performed in a conventional tube furnace at 900°C for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the samples were cleaned in acetone, 298

propanol alcohol (IPA) and deionized water (DI). Detailed schematics of the photovoltaic device and procedures lists are depicted in Table 6.1 and Figure 6.2.

6.4 Results and discussion
6.4.1 Morphology and Characterization of Nanofiber layer Figure 6.3 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of aggregate nanoparticles. It can be seen clearly that nano-particle clusters and nonporous existed in the irradiation spot. Bulk quantities of nanoparticles agglomerate through fusion to form interweaving three-dimensional fibrous structures that show a certain degree of 100

assembly. This hierarchical structure containing nanofibre and nano-scale particles could advance the development of photovoltaic properties. The nanofibres bond firmly to the silicon substrate. Therefore, no additional adhesive layer is need. Overall, the hierarchical three-dimensional web-like structure of nanofibre has a significant impact on increasing the immobilization amount of carrier separation. Moreover, as the repetition rate of the femtosecond laser increases, the electrical conductivity of the microstructure increases [225].

6.4.2 Light Reflection Figure (6.4) compares the light reflectance intensity of silicon nanofibre to a typical cSi wafer. The light reflectance of the fabricated Si nanofibre solar cell represented less than 0.008 (a.u) in the short wavelength regions ( 450 nm). In contrast with this

result, the Si nanofibre has reflectance below 0.003 (a.u) at   475 nm, which means that the incident light energies of more than 4.5 m can be trapped by this kind of 101

peculiar surface structure (importantly, the reflection enhancement can be extended to more than 7 m). The difference of the reflectance might be due to the emission of nanosize particles and their synthesis condition. The repetition rate and duration time have a significant effect on the reflectance of irradiated silicon (see Figures 6.5, 6.6). Polarization modifies the morphology of generated nanomaterial but does not have an effect on light reflection (see Figure 6.6), more detail discussion in our previous work [158]. The reduction of reflectance will enhance our capacity to improve solar cell performance. 6.4.3 Light Absorption The surface-structured silicon was measured using a Cary 3E spectrometer in the wavelength range of 0.4 1 .1 m. An unstructured crystalline silicon substrate was also measured for comparison (see Figure 6.7). Significant enhancement in light absorption for surface-structured samples is observed compared to that of unstructured silicon, which aligns with results from reflection test. The absorptance is up to 85% at 26MHz repetition rate, but decreases significantly (less than 20%) at 4.5MHz low repetition rate. The nanofibre increase the effective surface area, hence the absorptance is drastically improved. Moreover, the porous structure of the nano-network promotes multiple reflections, which will cause incident light to be trapped inside the surface nanostructure. As repetition rate increases, the thickness of the deposition increases, the particle size and porous size reduce [158, 225]. Therefore, the absorption enhancement is more prominent at higher repetition rate.

Compared to other works that used amorphous silicon [210, 226], this research results correspond to an increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around (1-2%) with a maximum short circuit current and open circuit voltage of 16.21 mA/cm2 and 0.95 V, respectively as shown in table 6.3.

These values were harvested at maximum repetition rate of 26MHz. Even though, our efficiency increment is not high enough, but on the other hand the low-cost and high throughput technique production of our technique is meaningful. It is worth noting that the conversion efficiency increases linearly with repetition rate. Limited by the laser configuration, we are not able to collect data on repetition rate higher than 26 MHz. Moreover, the thickness of the space-charge layer is not optimized yet. We believe there is room for raising the conversion efficiency.

106

6.5 The effect of laser parameters on efficiency
The most interesting phenomenon we observed was the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a nanofibre based solar cell demonstrating a significant relationship to the pulse width energy. The maximum power conversion efficiency obtained with devi ces' surface irradiated with high pulse energy (26 MHz). The femtosecond laser radiation involves steps such as non-linear absorption, plasma formation, shock wave propagation, melt propagation, and resolidification that affect the optical properties of the nanofibre [8, 18,198, and 206]. The 3D web-like nanofibrous structure significantly influences the sensitivity of the generation of an electron-hole pair: it works as a stepping trail for photons with insufficient energy to pump electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. The nanofibrous structure also benefits photovoltaic applications because of the increased effective surface area. The high surface-to-volume ratio in the nanofibrous structure is expected to exacerbate recombination, making surface passivation even more important for these devices than for bulk silicon solar cells [210]. After irradiation of the n-part of solar cell with high pulse energy, the substantial interfacial area for charge separation will be highly enhanced due to the surface-to-volume ratio. Hence, the efficiency of carrier separation and the transport will improve, and then the depletion region recombination will be dramatically enhanced as shown in Figure 6.9. As previously mentioned, the growth of the fibrous nanostructure is pulse-frequency dependent. Massive quantities of nanoparticles are created during the high pulse width, generating a thick layer of nanofibre. Hence, a dense network of nanofibre can provide both high surface area and direct connectivity to the electrode in a solar cell. This 107

enhancement of solar cell efficiency can be explained through quantum confinement effects. In silicon, the most immediate consequence of the confinement effect is an increase in band gap energy and an associated increase in the probability of radiative transfer. As the carriers are confined in real space, their associated wave functions spread out in momentum space. This increases the probability of radiative transfer as the electron-hole wave function overlaps. It has been found that the Si conduction band edge shifts to higher energy. Moreover, a strong increase in oscillator strength for transitions has been observed for nano particle sizes below 6 nm [116, 117].

Clearly, the laser parameters hold great promise in enhancing the photovoltaic performance through more tunable nanostructured light-sensing layers for different wavelengths.

6.6 The potential of the fabrication method
Even though crystalline silicon is a relatively poor absorber of light and requires a considerable thickness of material, it has proved convenient because it yields stable cells with good efficiency (up to 18%) and uses process technology developed from the huge knowledge base of the microelectronic industry. Long life time of silicon solar cell 25-30 years is another privilege. For these reasons, crystalline silicon solar cells take 80-90% of the market share. The priorities of industry are to improve the crystalline silicon (c-Si) process and technology. Combining of c-Si and nanomaterials is the main focusing here. This process is unrivalled in terms of processing cost, processing speed and processing simplicity. Instead of lithography process, chemical catalyst, background gas and vacuum chamber, ultra-fast laser technique can offers the possibility of both cost-reduction and efficiency - enhancement when implemented within next-generation advanced crystalline silicon solar cell production line [227]. However, the production of nanosilicon usually requires expensive equipments, long process time and low conversion rate. To have a viable technology, it is important to realize a low-cost and high throughput technique. The nanofiber layer can be processed (generation and deposition) in a single-step technique and the precursors are common materials. Also, the new technique generates intact web-like nanostructures with the ability to control the size of the nanostructures

109

by properly adjusting the laser parameters. The laser-based method also made it easy to be adapted to existing manufacturing process.

6.7 Summary
The fabrication of the silicon nanofibre based solar cell was optically characterized and compared with other amorphous photovoltaic. Femtosecond laser ablation on a thin layer of web-like silicon nanofibrous synthesis deposited material on a n-type silicon wafer to fabricate a sandwich p-i-n homojunction solar cell. These nanofibrous structures largely increase the p-n interference surface area by about 10 times (compared with that of untreated p-n silicon). The most interesting phenomenon we observed was the connection between laser parameters and spectral light absorption, which in turn reflect on solar cell efficiency. The pulse energy, laser fluence and laser power will have numerous beneficial effects on optical properties of irradiated materials. The present work may open up new possibilities in new nanomaterial syntheses that can be used in third generation solar cell fabrication.

Chapter 7: Summary, Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Research
7.1 Summary
The most important key parameters that are controlling the photovoltaic industry are the efficiency, cost and lifetime of solar cells. First generation solar cells still account for 86% of the solar cell market today, however, the high cost manufacturing process of this single crystal solar cell has led to the development of many approaches to improve photovoltaic technology. This research has focuses on a new concept of sandwich solar cells based on nanomaterials. The connection between the first generation solar cell (pn homojunction) and the third generation (nanomaterials) is presented in this project. The new concept is simple, low cost and easy to process using the femtosecond laser technique.

7.2 Conclusions
The research carried out in this work used simple and precise nano-scale fabrication to synthesize nanofibrous structures, using femtosecond laser radiation at MHz pulse repetition frequency in air at atmospheric pressure. The web-like interweaved nanofibers are attractive photovoltaic candidates because of their optical properties. Different laser mechanisms were used to generate a new photoactive nanostructured material, including the hybrid alloy. This Ag-Si hybrid alloy is proposed for applications in solar cell and other biomedical devices. A significant reduction in light reflection intensity (around 65%) was obtained for most of the

111

materials irradiated by the femtosecond laser. The quantum confinement effect was also proposed to explain the light absorption of semiconducting material. The surface plasmon resonance was the most applicable theory we used to explain the optical enhancement of the metal nanofibrous structure. Instead of a nano-hole array, a new finding of periodic micro-hole arrays filled with nanofiber was used to enhance the light absorption of the aluminum nanostructure. Finally, a new single crystal sandwich solar cell was fabricated. This new prototype of the homojunction silicon solar cell consists of a thin layer of silicon nanofibrous structure that is generated on the n-type silicon using femtosecond laser technique. The p-type silicon therefore was deposited on the n-type to construct p-n sandwich silicon solar cell, however, the efficiency of this sandwich solar cell was only 2% more effective than other traditional surface amorphous solar cells. On the other hand, the present device architecture and the new concepts may open up new possibilities for inexpensive photovoltaic based on nanomaterial. The other interesting phenomenon reported in this project is the significant relationship between the laser parameter (the repetition rate) and the solar cell efficiency. The experimental results show that the size, the length of aggregates and the location of growth can be controlled by laser parameters under ambient condition. In addition, this work demonstrates our preference for femtosecond laser ablation as a new technique for the synthesis of different materials. In conclusion, the main contributions are summarized below:  The development of a new method for the generation of a precise nano-scale fabrication technique for semiconducting, conducting and hybrids alloy

nanofibrous structure, using femtosecond laser radiation at MHz pulse repetition frequency in air at atmospheric conditions.  A rutile phase TiO 2 was synthesized through the irradiation of bulk titanium through femtosecond laser ablation. This spherical rutile phase, which is regularly generated by CVD, is particularly effective for use in the dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) due to its high surface area and the ability to absorb the UV wavelengths.  Identification of the significant relationship between the laser parameters (pulse duration time, pulse repetition rate, pulse width and the laser power) and the spectral response of fibrous nanostructure material. In addition, the threshold of a synthesized nanofibrous structure is strongly dependent on the MHz repetition rate and the properties of materials.  Improvements on visible light reduction: around 75-80% for silicon, 65-70% for metal, and 70-75% for metal coated on silicon.  Development of a new concept of sandwich solar cell based on a 3D nanofibrous layer. This photovoltaic prototype was simple, inexpensive and increased efficiency compared to other amorphous and thin sheet solar cells. The maximum short circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of 16.21mA/cm2 and 0.95 V (respectively) with an efficiency of 12.1%.

7.3 Suggestions for Further Research
In this section, we supply an overview of the main challenge of unifying efficiency, stability and processes for the same material. Our suggested work could be addressed by researchers and organizations working in photovoltaic research.  Instead of using a silicon nanofibre layer as the space region in a sandwich solar cell, research should conduct further studies on other metal nanoparticles.  Demonstrate the differences between organic and inorganic photovoltaic solar cells, which will enhance the long operation lifetimes of solar cell devices.  An understanding of stability/degradation in organic and polymer solar cells will lead to the development of new methods for enhancing stability through the selection of better active materials.  Research is needed into the chemical degradation of polymer solar cells, which should focus on the role of oxygen, water and electrode material reactions with the active polymer layer. This chemical reaction needs to be controlled by properly selecting the front metal contact.  Enhance third generation solar cell efficiency, which can be further investigated by considering other nano size materials like polymer, semiconductors or metals.
