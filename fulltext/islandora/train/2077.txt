An Assessment o f Municipal Capacity fo r Human-Wildlife Conflict Management in Selected Urban Areas o f Southern Ontario
Stephanie Kalt, Master of Applied Science (2004) in the program of Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University, Toronto

Recently, many Canadian municipalities have begun to experiment with urban naturalization programs. Consequently, many urban environments are now inhabited by a much larger wildlife population than they were several decades ago. The more species present in the city, the greater the potential for human-wildlife interaction and/or conflict. Current municipal capacity for human-wildlife conflict management is generally insufficient to deal with growing problems. New solutions for human-wildlife conflict are needed. Using selected municipalities in southern Ontario as an example, this thesis research explores the development and application o f principles for human-wildlife conflict management in urban areas. A literature review, media analysis and interviews with key municipal stakeholders were used to identify best management practices. Recommendations for the development of integrated nuisance management (INM) systems are proposed based on study findings.

INTRODUCTION
R esea rch P u rpose

U sing selected large municipalities in southern Ontario as an example, this research explores the development and application o f principles for human-wildlife conflict management in urban areas in the face o f expanded open space rehabilitation. The objective o f the research is the development o f principles for best management practices (BMP) through the identification o f successes, failures and lessons learned by municipalities.
1 .2 Background

To enhance habitat opportunities for urban biodiversity, there has been a recent trend towards the integration o f unused open space resources into the municipal land use system (Platt et al., 1994). However, the rehabilitation o f urban open space resources has also created an inadvertent attxactant and vector for the mtroduction o f `nuisance' species to urban areas that were previously uncolonized (Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001; Pedroli et al., 2002). As a result, human-wildlife conflict management has recently emerged as a major concern for both urban planners and the sustainability o f urban biodiversity. The complexity o f the numerous socio-economic and ecological factors involved in these conflicts requires the development o f a comprehensive tool for urban planners. "Unfortunately, there are [currently] no tools sufficiently adapted to the complexities of human-wildlife cohabitation in cities" (Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001). Traditional techniques for nuisance species control that have been applied in rural areas are perceived as being less suitable to the urban environment (Messmer, 2000). According to M essmer (2000), " [mjanagers must change their traditional emphasis from that o f managing population to enhancing wildlife's societal values... W ildlife managers will also need to have a better understanding about how and why human-wildlife conflicts occur, the magnitude and public perceptions o f the damage, and the strategies that can be implemented to address challenges posed by locally abundant wildlife populations". These are the important issues that are addressed by this thesis.

1.2.1

Why study urban human-wildlife conflict management?

W hile cities cover only about 0.2% o f Canada's land area, it would be incorrect to argue that urban areas are irrelevant to the future o f biodiversity in Canada. While the direct negative impact o f urbanization on biodi versity requires no explanation, it is the indirect impact o f urban areas as centres o f economic and political power that may be o f greater importance. As cities encompass close to 80% o f the Canadian population, m ost personal contacts with wild species occur in urban areas (Statcan, 2002). While more research is required to determine the linkage, if any, between exposure to wildlife in cities and decisions taken affecting biodiversity elsewhere in the country, some evidence suggests that personal exposure to nature in daily life is a

major determinant o f sensitivity to biodiversity issues (Middleton, 1994). Therefore, Canadian attitudes towards biodiversity and thus the future o f biodiversity itself may be significantly affected by personal interactions with the wild species and ecosystems found in cities (Savard et al., 2000; W HC, 2001). In addition, in certain cases, the success o f urban biodiversity can be a significant factor in the survival o f species in Canada (Middleton, 1994). For example, almost half o f Canada's threatened and endangered species are located in Canada's m ost heavily urbanized region, the Quebec City - W indsor corridor (Bourdages and Labelle, 2000). Therefore, i f urban biodiversity is to be sustained, wildlife and people will need to learn how to successfully co-exist. The growing level o f media attention being devoted to the issue suggests that this is n o t yet the case (see Section 3.3). Ironically, the positive increase in urban wildlife populations in response to protection has also adversely increased the level o f human-wildlife conflict (Messmer, 2000; Fall and Jackson, 2002). In municipal open space rehabilitation projects, identifying urban nuisance species, where and why they are likely to occur are the first steps towards being able to predict, understand and resolve human-wildlife conflicts and ensure the success o f urban biodiversity.

1.2.2

Definition o f Key Terms and Concepts

The following definitions are considered to be essential to the development and understanding of this research. Urban Wildlife Urban wildlife includes all non-domesticated species w ithin the urban area, whether native or non native, as well as both permanent and transient populations (Gibbs, 2001; WHC, 2001). W hile this definition includes both flora and fauna, the ability o f fauna to actively interact with humans has made it the focus o f the research. Nuisance Species There is no standard definition o f `nuisance' wildlife. The Ontario M inistry o f Natural Resources only classifies wildlife as a nuisance "when an animal damages, or is about to damage, your property" (OM NR, 2003). However, this discounts the role o f some wildlife species, for example, as a threat to human health and safety or as a source o f biological noise pollution. Through the Federal Pest Control Products Act (2002), this definition o f `pest' is expanded to include any organism that poses a threat to resources, human health, and/or exists in an undesirable location. For the purposes o f this study, nuisance species are broadly defined as those that are involved in any real or perceived negative interactions between humans and urban wildlife (see Section 3.2 for specific examples). This is also the definition used to describe species in the field o f humanwildlife conflict management (Messmer, 2000).

For the purposes o f this study, a `conflict' is defined as the result o f negative interactions between humans and wildlife. Conflicts can be either real or perceived, and may lead to the need for action to reduce friction (Messmer, 2000). By contrast, wildlife contact involves all human-wildlife interactions, positive or negative. Thus, urban residents can have contact with nuisance species w ith or without the generation o f conflict. Human-Wildlife Conflict Management According to Messmer (2000), "the phrase `human-wildlife conflict management' has emerged to describe techniques and strategies that are being applied to manage all situations that involve any and all negative interactions between humans and wildlife" . This can include a wide range o f activities. For example, these techniques and strategies can be directed at wildlife management, involving both the direct and indirect management o f species habitat and populations. Conversely, these techniques and strategies can be directed at influencing human behaviour to help mitigate the frequency o f conflicts and increase public tolerance o f nuisance species. Urban A review o f literature found that there is no single qualitative or quantitative definition of `urban' that is used by either social or natural sciences (McIntyre et al., 2000). For the purposes o f this study, an urban area is defined as a municipal-level political unit with a minimum total population o f 100,000 people. Open Space An open space is defined as a "landscape unit (a) composed of plant and animal communities, water bodies, soil and rock, (b) largely devoid o f man-made structures, (c) maintained and managed in such a way as to promote or enhance populations o f wildlife" (Platt et ah, 1994). This can include many types o f urban habitat - managed parks, conservation areas, unused or abandoned developed lands, stream corridors, wetlands, forests and wildflower meadows are only a few examples. Naturalization Depending on an individual's professional background, the term `naturalization' can have many different meanings. For the purposes o f this study, naturalization will be broadly defined as the rehabilitation of natural areas, i.e, any active or passive procedure that targets the establishment, recovery or enhancement o f ecological functions and processes o f a natural area within the context o f a disturbed landscape (Heaton et ah, 2002). In general, the goal o f naturalization projects is to establish or re-establish an ecologically balanced landscape.

METHODOLOGY OF STUDY

I ' ;

There are three research methods that have been applied to this Master's Degree Thesis 1) literature review, 2) media monitoring, and 3) stakeholder interviews. 2.1
L it e r a t u r e R e v ie w

As with any research, a review of relevant literature formed the context for this study. The literature review focused on four key areas; 1. 2. 3. 4. Nuisance species population identification, distribution, dynamics and behaviour; Trends in urban open space rehabilitation, including the relationship between this practice and the (re)colonization o f wildlife species; Human-wildlife conflict management in urban areas, with a focus on understanding human perceptions and differing management philosophies and practices; and The current practice o f municipal open space planning and wildlife management in southern Ontario.

' :

Academic texts, journal articles, theses, and conference proceedings provided the information for the first three subject areas. However, the main focus o f the literature review was a review of relevant documents produced by municipalities within the study area, identified through internet searches and during key informant interviews. 2.2
M e d ia M
o n it o r in g

To supplement information collected during, the literature review, a media monitoring exercise was conducted between May 1, 2003 and August 30, 2003. For this exercise, the identification of urban `nuisance' species ineidents that are reported by the media was used as a proxy for a public survey of the perception o f urban wildlife conflicts in Canada. Media monitoring also assisted in the identification o f major urban wildlife issues within the study area and possible models for human-vrildlife management employed by municipalities across Canada. The process undert ' en for the exercise as well as an analysis o f the results o f media monitoring are detailed further in Section 3.3. 2.3
K e y I n f o r m a n t I n t e r v ie w s

Information collected during the literature review and media monitoring were used to form the basis for key informant interviews. Between January and April 2004, a total o f 20 interviews were conducted with key staff from each selected municipality and Conservation Authority within the study area. This has allowed for a more in-depth examination o f the current state o f humanwildlife conflict management in southern Ontario, with insights into the perception and practice of wildlife conflict management as it varies among municipalities and among administrative divisions within municipalities.

Open-ended interviews of relevant staff were conducted by telephone. Key informants to be interviewed were selected based on their professional connection to either municipal open space planning and/or wildlife management. For each municipality, this included at least one professional selected from the Planning Division and the Parks Division, as well as one as one relevant professional from the local Conservation Authority, Additional interview subjects were also contacted following the recommendation of interviewees. Following the research protocol approved by the Ryerson University Human Ethics Review Board, initial contact with the subjects to be interviewed was made by standard mail. In addition to the study recruitment note, potential subjects were sent an information package that included a consent agreement and a copy o f the questions that they would be asked to answer. Subjects that agreed to participate were interviewed based on a set o f pre-determined, openended questions (see Appendix A for complete set of questions). These interview questions were divided into four areas o f interest: A. Background Information - These questions related to the role that the interviewee and their department or division play in the municipality. The purpose o f this section was to establish a context for the responses provided during the rest o f the interview. Public Perceptions of Nuisance Species - As detailed by Messmer (2000), one "approach that has been successfully used to manage human-wildlife conflicts involves changing the perceptions o f people experiencing the damage by increasing their willingness to tolerate change". However, in order to effectively manage human-wildlife conflicts, the conflicts must first be understood. Questions in this section were designed to gauge how the residents and government of different municipalities view urban wildlife, and whether any programs are in place to evaluate and/or manage public perceptions o f urban wildlife. Biodiversity Science and Information - Planning for conservation is a process that uses scientific data. Experts have suggested that in order to preserve its biodiversity, at a minimum, a city must inventory its open spaces and ecological resources (Andrews and Cranmer-Byng, 1981; Inoguchi et al., 1999). For effective management, ecological data must be available to and be understood by not only decision-makers but also those who will be affected by the decisions being made (Theobald et al., 2000; EMAN, 2003). Questions in this section related to the type o f biodiversity science and information that is maintained by each municipality, its uses and its accessibility. Planning for Naturalization Projects - In recognition o f its central importance to urban habitat conservation and diversification, there has been a recent trend towards the rehabilitation o f rights-of-way, stream corridors, grass wastelands and many parks in urban areas across North America (Platt et al., 1994). However, significant planning is required to ensure that such projects result in sustainable improvements rather than further problems. In theory, many problems can be avoided if residents are informed of and/or are conferred a sense of local ownership and empowerment over rehabilitation projects (Caldecott, 1996; Beatley, 2000). Questions in this section relate to the nature o f

naturalization projects that have been undertaken in each municipality, including project design criteria and community response. The exact order and precise wording o f the open-ended questions was m olded to suit the interview - the number and type o f questions asked were directly related to the role that the interviewee played in their municipality. During the interview, the interviewees were also asked to identify and/or forward any relevant public documentation that they felt would be o f use in furthering the study. This docum entation has been used to supplem ent the literature review.

Study

To add focus to the study, this research is delimited both geographically and temporally.

2.4.1

Geograph ic Scope

There are numerous cities in Canada that meet the definition o f `urban'. However, a comparison of municipal human-wildlife management capacity requires that an ecosystem-based approach be applied to ensure that the same general group of species is considered in each municipality. With approximately 10% of the Canadian population, the Lake Erie Lowland ecoregion is the most populated in Canada (EC, 1995). For tWs reason, it is the focus o f this study. The extent o f the Lake Erie Lowland ecoregion, located within the Mixedwood Plains ecozone, is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Geographical Scope of Study Area, Lake Erie Lowland

An examination o f census information, produced by Statistics Canada found that there are currently 13 municipalities in the Lake Erie Lowland that meet the study definition o f `urban'. These are Toronto, Mississauga, Hamilton, London, Brampton, Markham, Windsor, Vaughan, Burlington, Oakville, Oshawa, Richmond Hill, and St. Catharines. Due to their proximity to the ecoregion and their relative importance as urban areas in southern Ontario, the municipalities of Kitchener, Waterloo and Guelph are also included in the study.' This creates a total o f 16 candidate urban study areas.

2.4.2

Selection ofMunicipalities fo r Study

From this list o f candidate municipalities, a sample of six municipalities was selected for fiirther study. This selection was performed for two reasons. First, the objective o f the thesis is to document and assess the successes, failures and lessons learned on human-wildlife conflict management. As such, a strategic decision was made to narrow the scope in order to focus on those municipalities seen to be the most proactive in this area. In addition, it was determined that a narrowed scope would allow for a more accurate and meaningful analysis given the time allotted for the completion of the research. Selection of the six cities to be studied began with a review of information and documents available through the municipal websites maintained by each o f the 16 candidate municipalities, as well as those o f their associated Conservation Authorities. Based on a preliminary review o f on line information, nine criteria were selected that would suggest proactive municipal action on the environment and/or urban wildlife management. These criteria are as follows: 1. Environmental Strategic Plan (ESP) - evidence o f an ESP prepared or in development suggests proactive action on the environment. ESP may be general or issue-specific. Environmental Advisory Committee (EAC) - evidence o f the existence of such bodies suggests strong citizen involvement in the municipal decision-making process. Greenspace and/or Biological Inventory (GBI) - evidence of biological studies suggests knowledge on biodiversity that may help plan land use within the municipality. Naturalization Projects (NP) - evidence of successful or planned projects suggests creation of habitat and/or vectors for réintroduction of wildlife into urban areas. Greenspace and/or wildlife considered in Official Plan (OP) - evidence o f greenspace planning in the OP suggests proactive action on the environment. Note: for many urban areas, the text o f the OP is often unavailable except by purchase from the municipality. Nuisance Species (NS) - evidence that wildlife nuisances have been publicly identified suggests that the municipality has identified a problem which requires action.

Reputation (Rep.) - evidence that the City has a reputation as an environmental leader suggests an extended history of proactive action on the environment. Reputation was assessed based on municipal claims and awards received. Environmental Management Systems (EMS) - evidence of EMS adoption/creation, either general or issue-specific, suggests proactive environmental planning and management. Public Awareness Campaigns (PAC) - evidence o f PAC related to greenspaces and/or urban wildlife suggests proactive action on human-wildlife conflict management.

The results o f this analysis are shown in Table I. Based on internet-based evidence, municipalities were assigned a score for each o f the above criteria from 0-1. A score o f ` T indicates that there is definite evidence o f significant effort on a particular criterion; a score of `0.5' indicates that there is some evidence o f efforts; and a score o f `0' indicates that there is either no evidence of efforts or that the available evidence is inconclusive. The rank of each municipality was then calculated by the sum o f the scores for each criterion, with each attribute given equal weight.

There are several limitations to this method. First and foremost, this method is limited as the concept of providing information to stakeholders through the internet is relatively new at the municipal level and many municipal websites are still in the early phases o f development. In addition, smaller municipalities often do not have the same level o f resources available to devote to website maintenance as do larger municipalities. Therefore, a score o f `0' in Table 1 does not necessarily indicate that no efforts exist to meet a given criterion, but rather that efforts in this area could not be substantiated based on the available internet resources. Consequently, the results o f the website analysis may be skewed such that the six municipalities that received the highest total score may not in actuality be the most proactive. However, as resulting information is only being used for the purposes of scoping and sample selection, any limitations o f the analysis are not expected to have a significant impact on the outcome o f the overall study. According to the analysis shown in Table 1, the following six municipalities are the most environmentally proactive major urban centres in southern Ontario: Burlington (7.5), Waterloo (7.5), Mississauga (7.0), Hamilton (6.5), Guelph (6.5), and London (5.5). The City o f Toronto was eliminated from the analysis as it was assumed that, with more than twice the population of any other municipality in southern Ontario, the special management challenges that Toronto faces would not make it a suitable comparison given the purposes o f this study. To provide context to the analysis presented in this thesis, more detail on each o f the six municipalities selected for study is found in Appendix B.

2.4.3

Temporal Scope

This study is only concerned with those municipal activities that have occurred in the past fifteen years, 1990-2004. During this period, there has been an increasing trend towards the rehabilitation o f urban green space resources for the purposes o f maximizing biodiversity (Platt et al., 1994; Sabloff, 2001). It is also during this period that urban human-wildlife conflict management began to emerge as an important area o f knovdedge (Messmer, 2000). While the recent amalgamation o f several cities in southern Ontario may limit some results o f the research, this limitation is considered to be unavoidable on a temporal scale.

N a t u r a l iz a t io n

Cities are generally viewed as human-dominated landscapes that are detrimental to nature. However, within the past decade, there has been a broadening o f public understanding o f the value and functions o f open spaces within urban areas (Kanter, 1990; Platt et al., 1994; Sabloff, 2001; WHC, 2001). Urban areas are now acquiring open spaces and, where possible, maintaining natural form in order to support a variety o f initiatives that promote urban health and sustainability (Schauman and Salisbury, 1998). Due to the rapid process o f urbanization that has occurred in southern Ontario, many cities now need to be retrofit to include natural areas through a process o f naturalization. Starting in the 1980s, a number o f municipalities in southern Ontario began to develop more formal naturalization policies and programs (Ingram et al., 2001). This makes not only sound ecological but also sound socio-economic sense. The following list, adapted from Hudson (2000), shows some of the benefits that municipalities can realize as a result o f urban naturalization; Benefit Type Ecological Description o f Benefit Enhanced biodiversity - species diversity and abundance encouraged through creation o f habitat and/or wildlife migration corridors. Reduced toxins - eliminated use o f pesticides, fertilizers and other toxic chemicals in park maintenance. Carbon absorption - urban forests sequester atmospheric carbon. Improved air quality - removal o f airborne particulate and gaseous pollutants (efficiency depends on type and location o f vegetation). Improved water quality - natural areas act as filtration systems for water, provide nutrient uptake and pollutant removal. Ecological consciousness - opportunities for ecological education.

Social/Human

Community identity - anecdotal evidence suggests presence o f nature contributes to sense o f community; source o f community pride. Community empowerment - naturalization projects act as focal points for empowering local communities to enact social change. Reduced crime - increased perception o f safety; some studies have shown lower levels o f crime following urban naturalization. Recreational opportunities - naturalized areas can meet both active and passive recreational demands. Physical health - improved air and water quality; health benefits o f exercise related to increased recreational opportunities. Mental health - aesthetic value; research shows exposure to nature can contribute to stress reduction. Water management - porous natural surfaces absorb rainfall; reduced volume o f stormwater requiring municipal treatment. Also, vegetative cover reduces magnitude o f slope erosion and sedimentation problems. Park maintenance - significant cost savings through reduced maintenance; fewer chemical inputs and lower public water demands. Property values - higher consumer willingness to pay for property in proximity to the benefits o f nature; results in strong municipal tax base. Energy conservation - vegetation has moderating effect on temperature; reduced need o f energy for heating and cooling.

Economic

Most naturalization initiatives appear to be economically motivated, with municipal areas being naturalized when they become too costly to maintain or for the purposes o f improved stormwater management (Flegel and Jacob, 1996; Platt et al., 1994). While the initial costs associated w ith a naturalization project may be high, once established, the low level of maintenance required to sustain the naturalized area can result in significant cost savings when compared to the alternative o f continuing conventional horticultural practices (Guelph, 1993). Similarly, the water retention, filtration, erosion and sediment control services provided by natural areas can significantly defer the infrastructure costs associated with conventional stormwater treatment and flood control (Hudson, 2000). However, while economic benefits may be used as justification for undertaking a naturalization project, this does not undermine its clear ecological and social benefits. The numerous applications of naturalization make it relevant to a wide range o f municipal departments, including Planning, Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Environment, Public Health and Economic Development (Ingram et al., 2001). While municipalities support naturalization to lower maintenance costs and support community demands for passive recreation, developers have become interested in the ability of naturalization to increase local property values. The benefits o f naturalization to stormwater management have also led Ontario's Conservation Authorities to be particularly active in this area.
3.2 NUISANCES AND NATURALIZATION

Throughout the past two decades, a major challenge for these municipal authorities has been determining how to integrate unused open space resources of the city into the land use system in 11

order to maximize diversity (Platt et al., 1994). Despite the formal naturalization policies and programs that have been developed by municipalities, most naturalization projects remain relatively small in scale. While each individual land use change may result in a negligible impact, · the accumulation o f these changes over time within a landscape may be significant. Numerous small changes will eventually aggregate to enhance not only the environmental quality o f a city but also the access and/or exposure to nature by its inhabitants (Schauman and Salisbury, 1998). Through the improvement o f habitat conditions and the creation o f important migration corridors for wildlife, urban naturalization has indirectly had a positive impact on the abundance and overall health of urban wildlife populations (Fleury and Brovm, 1997; Pedroli et al., 2002; Poole, 2003.06.14). Other species, such as the beaver and the coyote, are becoming increasingly well adapted to life in urban environments (Sabloff, 2001). Consequently, many urban environments are now inhabited by a much larger wildlife population than they were several decades ago (Messmer, 2000). However, despite attempts to create or enhance habitat, urban growth means that the space available to wildlife in the city is increasingly restricted (Poole, 2003.06.14). While most urban residents generally enjoy seeing wildlife, augmented exposure and negative experiences associated with locally overabundant wildlife populations are increasing public concern over these species. Table 2 provides a list o f species that are relatively common in urban and suburban areas o f southern Ontario, their ecological or socio-economic benefits, and the theoretical nuisances they can create for city residents.

While, for example, skunks and raccoons are attracted to improperly stored waste, not all humanwildlife interactions that create nuisances are accidental. Recognizing the socio-economic benefits o f urban wildlife, many residents o f southern Ontario actively encourage wildlife interactions. According to one study, urban residents spend an average o f $60 US and 22 hours each year trying to enhance neighbourhood wildlife populations (Messmer, 2000). The provision o f backyard bird feeders and bativs draws not only a wide variety o f birds, but also squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rats, and other species. However, as will be discussed in Section 4.2, residents often have a love-hate relationship with these species. While people may encourage songbirds at feeders, they may not support the presence o f larger birds (e.g. peregrine falcons) that would prey on the songbirds. Naturalization projects have also been shown to directly and indirectly contribute to an increase in urban `nuisances'. For example, despite the potential health, safety and even ecological concerns associated with coyotes in the city, naturalization managers in Toronto's Tommy Thompson Park have constructed den sites to make the park more attractive to coyotes (TRCA, 2000). This may be a benefit for the ecological balance o f the park, but what about for city residents?

The previous section establishes a theoretical basis for concern over the increasing need for human-wildlife conflict management in urban areas. In order to justify the need for this study, one m ust also establish whether urban residents and/or municipal governments o f southern Ontario perceive that there is a conflict between humans and wildlife that goes beyond the theoretical. However, the preliminary literature review revealed that no data are currently available to address this issue. In general, there is little research that has yet been done on human perception and appreciation o f urban wildlife (Savard et al., 2000). A s a result, this thesis has used a daily media monitoring exercise as a proxy for a survey o f public opinion on human-wildlife conflict. Studies have shown that, due to their wide audience, newspapers can act as a source o f useful data on both urban wildlife and local attitudes towards it (Vuorisalo et al., 2001). Conducted during the Summer 2003, this media monitoring exercise analyses the level o f nuisance complaints through the identification o f any urban `nuisance' wildlife incidents that are reported by the media. Media monitoring has also assisted in the identification o f possible human-wildlife management models and the perspectives on human-wildlife conflict o f urban residents across Canada.

3.3.1

Methodology

M edia monitoring was conducted using the ^Green in Sight" software available through the Environment Canada intranet, for the period o f May 1, 2003 to August 30, 2003. This software provides access to a large number o f large- and medium-sized newspapers from across Canada. The focus o f the media monitoring exercise was the `W ildlife' category o f `Green in Sight'. The key words used to identify articles in the `W ildlife' category o f the media monitoring tool reflect the priorities o f Environment Canada, and are therefore in constant flux. The following list

To help simplify the list, instances where several words can be derived from the same root are indicated by an asterisks (e.g., the root `bio*' could denote `biodiversity', `biological', `biology', `biologist', etc.).

In addition to the words found in the above list, the specific names o f several government and non-government organizations are also included in the key word list o f the media monitoring tool. This would include all federal departments and m ost provincial departments with an environment or wildlife management role, as well as specific ENGOs.

3.3.2

Media Analysis

During the Summer 2003, there were approximately 148 articles reported by mid- to large-size newspapers across Canada that addressed the issue o f `nuisance' wildlife in urban areas.^ Close to 33% o f these were published by newspapers within the study area o f southern Ontario. Figure 2 shows the distribution o f the nuisance species which received the greatest number o f media references in the Summer o f 2003, with bears representing the greatest number o f reports,

followed by white-tailed dv.. Jrds, bats, coyotes, etc. Other species that received a passing mention in one or two articles are not integrated into Figure 2, but include: gophers, fox, squirrel, woodchuck, turtles, snakes, rabbit, ducks, wolf, ants and other bugs, rats, and feral cats.

Species

A s can be seen, close to 70% o f all reports related to species commonly found within the study area. Notable exceptions are bears (black and grizzly), cougar, and moose. Unfortunately, it is not possible to compare this distribution to a Canada-wide or even Ontario-wide listing, as no such inventory exists. The Ontario Ministry o f Natural Resources does not actively monitor urban wildlife unless species pose a significant economic or public safety concern (MacLeod, 2003.08.09). As discovered during key informant interviews, even on a City-wide level, most municipalities have either no information or have only anecdotal information related to the distribution o f nuisance species problems. However, the types o f species listed in fact sheets and other information materials intended as public education resources do suggest which species might be o f greatest public concern and interest. Examples o f species lists produced by organizations that operate in southern Ontario include: · · Canadian Federation o f Humane Societies - lists raccoons, squirrels, pigeons, skunks, mice and rats as common urban wildlife problems (CFHS, 2004). Ontario M ini shy Natural Resources - specific fact sheets on red foxes and bats, but also lists white-tailed deer, bears, raccoons and skunks as potential nuisances (OMNR, 2003). 16

Hamilton Conservation Authority - deer, raccoons, rabbits, woodpeckers, squirrels, skunks, rats and mice identified as some o f the most common species to be encountered by those living in proximity to a natural area (HCA, 2002), City o f W aterloo - raccoons, squirrel, skunks, rats, mice, groundhogs, muskrats, birds, bees, rabbits, foxes and deer identified as some o f the m ost common urban species (Waterloo, 1998b). City o f Mississauga - skunks, pigeons, waterfowl, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, squirrels and other rodents, and snakes identified as common urban species (Mississauga, 2003a). AAA Wildlife Control - provides educational fact sheets on raccoons, squirrels, skunk, and brown bats (AAA, 2003).

Clearly, there is some agreement between these lists and the species identified in Figure 2, However, the list of nuisances that has been created as a result o f the media monitoring is void o f any economic or ecological data, and thus does not necessarily reflect the true distribution o f nuisances in Canada. This is because there are some problem species - such as mice - that are so common that they are generally no longer reported on as nuisances. The species prominent in Figure 2 received more media attention as a result o f some particular issues that arose during the Summer 2003. For example, bears (black and grizzly) have made the news as habitat change and the cancellation o f the spring bear hunt in Ontario have resulted in increased conflicts w ith bears in semi-urban areas across Ontario and Canada. The large number o f deer reports published during the Summer 2003 can mainly be attributed to a debate over management options for the overabundant deer population in the Sifton Bog o f London, Ontario. An increased public awareness related to W est Nile Virus (WNV) also caused a probable spike in nuisance reports related to a number o f species. Naturalization projects (especially those that involve wetlands or watersheds) have recently been the subject of increased media scrutiny related to their potential to attract mosquitos. Several municipalities across Canada also began to consider or to conduct a cull o f the crow population, using their recognized status as an indicator species for the spread o f WNV as an excuse to reduce unrelated noise and other nuisance conflicts generated by crows. From these reports, it is clear that Canadians need more education regarding WNV and possible vectors for the spread o f the disease. Rabies is another disease which captured the attention o f the media in 2003. Instances o f raccoon rabies have increased dramatically since 1999, with the border regions o f Ottawa, Oshawa and Niagara recognized as the prime `danger zones'. As a result, Ontario launched a new $2 M campaign to halt the spread o f raccoon rabies in Ontario with a prime objective o f stopping the spread o f the disease into urban areas (Reguly, 2003.05.25). Similarly, while coyotes make up only a very small percent o f Ontario's reported rabies cases, reports in Summer 2003 related to coyotes increased after a series o f coyote attacks in Toronto parks. Reports related to bats increased at the end o f the Summer 2003 when several bats tested positive for rabies near Hamilton and London. However, as bats are also closely tied to WNV via mosquito control, some attention has also been given to the concept o f reestablishing native urban bat populations (e.g. through the adoption o f urban `bat houses') as a potential mosquito control measure.

Yet other species - for example, birds and skunks - continue to receive media attention not related to any signiilcant issue such as public health or safety, but rather due to an ongoing public perception of them as `nuisances'. Figure 3 demonstrates the nature of nuisance complaints that were reported by the media in the Summer o f 2003, and their distribution.

As can be seen, close to 60% of nuisance reports reference concerns for public health and safely. Most public safety concerns relate to the presence of large predators and other aggressive species (e.g. bears, coyotes, or even Canada geese), or to the potential for severe collisions. Important public health concerns include rabies, as well as emerging diseases (e.g. WNV) or those associated with overabundant animals and their feces. Research performed in the United States suggests that the consequences o f such wildlife incidents in urban areas can be significant. It is estimated that, on an annual basis, approximately 75,000 people are injured or taken ill and 415 people die because of wildlife related incidents in the United States. These figures include 28,000 people injured in vehicle collisions, 35,000 bitten by wildlife, and 12,000 who become ill because of other wildlife related diseases (Conover et al., 1998). Apart from obvious threats to public health and safety, additional studies based on survey evidence also demonstrate the wide distribution of other real consequences that urban humanwildlife conflicts may present. As stated by Messmer (2000); "[ojver 60% o f urban and suburban households in the US annually experience problems with wildlife... Urban households reported a mean loss o f $63 per household or a total loss of $1.9 billion because of wildlife damage. Urban residents also reported spending over 260 million hours trying to solve or prevent these problems". 18

The findings o f studies such as these are also reflected in the results o f the media monitoring exercise. Mentioned in approximately 22% o f reports, concerns for property or other economic damage as a result of contact with wildlife received the second greatest number of references during the Summer 2003. Common complaints in this area include vehicle collisions, lawn and gardening- conflicts, home "invasions" (i.e. presence/nesting o f species in human structures), as well as a myriad of other problems. Canada geese may be the classic example of this in southern Ontario; having benefitted from the feeding opportunities they find in urban parks, beaches and golf courses and the relative lack o f natural or human predators, urban populations of Canada geese have exploded. Managing problems associated with the overabundant geese - including damage to lawns and beaches as a result o f foraging and droppings, drinking water source fecal contamination, and collisions w ith vehicles and aircraft - can place a major economic strain on municipalities (EC, 2003; Oliviera, 2003.07.10). Despite this potential for serious consequences, close to 17% o f reports still identified species as a nuisance based on a perceived rather than a real conflict. Complaints in this category include noise, fear, aesthetics, and many other undefined reasons. While most urban residents derive numerous benefits from wildlife in the city, the mere presence o f certain species (for example, skunks and snakes) is considered sufficient for them to be classified as a wildlife nuisance. Although not shown in Figure 3, a small number o f reports did emerge to highlight the positive aspects of and the need to co-exist with urban wildlife. In many cases, complaints regarding species overabundance include the threat o f ecological damage amongst potential nuisances. This is also seen in the debate over the overabundant population o f deer in the Sifton Bog, the Ontario bear hunt, and attempts to monitor and reduce the number o f roadkills in urban areas.

P r a c t ic e

From the media analysis presented above, it is clear that there are several real and perceived human-wildlife conflicts that exist in the urbanized areas of southern Ontario. This is a fact that has been recognized not only by the public, but also by various levels o f government. The following section provides a more specific overview of the current practice o f urban humanwildlife conflict management in Ontario.

3.4.1

Jurisdictional Issues and Legislation

In Ontario, most wildl ife matters are referred to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR). The OMNR enforces the Fish and Wildlife Conservation A ct (1997) which sets out the legal actions property owners can take, when they can take those actions, and the species of animal to which those actions apply. As outlined by the OMNR (2003), in general: "Landowners, or an agent o f the landowners may capture, kill, or harass wildlife to stop it from damaging the landowner's property. There are some exceptions: · Moose, caribou, elk or endangered species cannot be captured, killed or harassed in protection o f property;

· ·

White-tailed deer cannot be captured, killed, or harassed unless you possess a Deer Removal Permit issued by the [OMNR]; Unnecessaiy suffering cannot be caused to any wildlife; Bears killed in defence of property must be immediately reported to the local MNR office. As well, specially protected raptors and forbearing mammals^^^ killed in defence o f property and that an individual wishes to keep must be reported to the MNR within two working days."

Agents employed by the landowner to deal with nuisance wildlife must have authorization from the OMNR. In addition, a live-captured nuisance animal must, within 24 hours, be released in close proximity to where it was caught (up to a maximum of one kilometre), be turned over to an authorized wildlife custodian, or be humanely euthanized. However, the OMNR does not condone the killing o f wildlife where other options might be available (OMNR, 2003). Other federal and provincial legislation may also apply to the management o f nuisance species in urban areas. In Ontario, where actions related to particular species are governed by both the Ontario Endangered Species Act (1990) and the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, the provision that affords the most protection prevails. Similarly, specific federal legislation gives Environment Canada jurisdiction over migratory birds, certain wetland species, and designated species at risk. For example, under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act (1994), efforts to control locally overabundant Canada goose populations will require federal permits. More than the legislation itself, o f interest to this study is how the above noted legal requirements are applied on a local basis as well as the policies, procedures and municipal guidance that go beyond these legal requirements to create the overall urban wildlife management regime. In most cases, the involvement o f the OMNR is restricted to an advisory role. The OMNR will help landowners by providing information on animal biology and behaviour, animal control services and recommended best practices, appropriate animal control agency referrals, and information required to obtain permits where required. However, it is commonly understood that "landowners are responsible for managing nuisance animals on their properties including any costs" (OMNR, 2003). For urban residents, this means that the management o f problems related to urban wildlife in southern Ontario is largely the responsibility of the individual or the municipality, most often in agreement with the local Conservation Authority. As will be seen, the techniques by which this is accomplished vary greatly both within and among municipalities. These techniques are likely to evolve as the science that supports human-wildlife management improves.

3.4.2

Techniques fo r Wildlife Damage Management

While the concept o f managing wildlife damage is not new, "[tjhe continued growth o f human populations and their expansion into new areas has increased the interface between humans and wildlife and added new dimensions to the.. . problem of human-wildlife conflict" (Fall and Jackson,

2002). Wildlife damage has traditionally been thought o f as a rural or agricultural problem, with damage control measures focused on reducing the economic losses caused by wildlife to crops and livestock. (Messmer, 2000). However, as the nature and location o f the conflict changes, so must the management techniques. Studies have shown that urban residents do not respond to wildlife problems and animal damage control in the same manner as rural residents (O'Donnell and VanDruff, 1983). For example, concerns for public safety and property damage make traditional wildlife management techniques such as hunting and trapping unacceptable in urban areas. Additionally, there is a declining public tolerance o f lethal methods o f wildlife management (Fall and Jackson, 2002). As urban decisions to control a particular wildlife species tend to depend more on public attitudes towards that species than actual damage, public perceptions will also limit the control measures employed (O'Donnell and VanDruff, 1983). Consequently, comprehensive solutions to urban and suburban human-wildlife conflicts are difficult as the control measures used must often be as specific as the actual problem. Fortunately, there is a wide range o f wildlife damage management techniques that exist and can be used in different situations with varying effectiveness. The general characteristics o f the most frequently cited techniques are outlined below. 1. Habitat Management - T echnique involves the modification o f habitat through architectural or landscape design to make it less attractive to species causing nuisances. For example, increasing, grass height will help deter nuisance geese and gulls that prefer large open areas with good visibility (Belant, 1997). Conversely, maintaining a mowed strip o f grass around a property will deter the immigration o f many rodents and snakes that prefer a large amount o f cover (CFHS, 2004). Habitat management has a good success rate, but may not be feasible in naturalized areas. Food Source Management - Technique involves the removal or containment of a food or v/ater source that is attracting species causing nuisances. For example, the secure (i.e. animal-proof; disposal o f residential garbage will significantly reduce conflicts with urban species looking for a free meal (CFHS, 2004). Again, this technique has a good success rate, but may not be feasible in naturalized areas. Averse Conditioning - Technique involves the use of ffightening devices to disperse resident nuisances and discourage species immigration. Common frightening devices that have been used with varying success include whistles, sirens, water sprays, predator decoys, dogs, falcons, lighting, flags, etc. However, the success o f rate of this technique is limited as it is impractical in the long-term and as species can become habituated to the negative stimuli (Belant, 1997). Exclusion - Technique involves the use of fencing and other devices to physically prevent or discourage the entry of species into specific areas. For example, overhead lines and netting are proven effective in excluding gulls and other birds from urban beaches (Belant, 1997). Wildlife-proofing o f buildings involves little effort and is effective in discouraging home invasions. However, for large-scale nuisances, fencing programs are expensive to maintain and have been generally unsuccessful (London, 2003c).

Repellents - Teclmique involves the use o f tactile or other sensory repellants to deter wildlife. Planting garden species that are unappealing to or inedible by deer may help abate vegetation damage (I^ndon^ 2003c). A wide variety of pesticides, insecticides and rodenticides are also available to repel wildlife. Besides being inhumane and/or environmentally hazardous, control by toxicants is limited in urban areas as it is illegal under the Criminal Code o f Canada to place poison where it can be accessed by domestic animals (CFHS, 2004). Capture, Removal and Relocation - Technique involves the live trapping, removal and relocation o f individual nuisances. Live trapping, used most often to remove wildlife from buildings when an animal cannot be convinced to leave on their own, is best done by credible wildlife control operators to ensure that the animal is not injured in the process {AAA^ 2003; CFHS, 2004), However, if not combined with other techniques, capture and removal is an ineffective solution as species tend to recolonize. Due to the poor success rate o f relocated species and potential for the spread o f disease, provincial regulations in Ontario prohibit the long-range (i.e. > 1 km) relocation o f most species o f captured wildlife without a permit (OMl'TR, 2003). Nest/Egg Disturbance - Technique involves the active management o f the density o f bird populations through the disturbance, removal or destruction o f nests and/or eggs to suppress reproduction. Under the Migratory Birds Convention Act { \ 994), the use o f this technique on migratory species such as Canada geese, ducks and gulls will require a federal permit. Anti-Fertility Programs - Technique involves the active control o f the density o f certain large-scale nuisances through the suppression o f reproduction by physical sterilization or birth control. Chemosterilization was one o f the management options considered by the Sifton Bog White-tailed deer Steering Committee (London, 2003c). As this technique is still largely experimental, its effectiveness has not yet been proven. Introduction o f Natural Predators - Technique involves the passive control o f the density o f nuisances through the réintroduction o f natural predators. The application o f this option is limited as urban habitat is often insufficient to support many species o f predator. The presence o f predators in the city also creates concerns for the safety o f the public and other non-target species (Belant, 1997; London, 2003c). Lethal Methods - Technique involves all methods o f active wildlife management that result in the death o f wildlife species. This option includes many o f the traditional wildlife management strategies, such as hunting, trapping- and the use o f lethal toxicants. Though in certain respects more humane, some o f the other management options mentioned above (e.g. natural predation and nest disturbance) could also be considered lethal.

Amongst a wide variety o f other less common and more experimental measures, the above mentioned techniques are also supplemented by the option to either do nothing or to manage the damage caused by the wildlife rather than the wildlife itself. For example, while the City of Calgary has not ruled out lethal measures to control a growing beaver population tliat threatens

the City's urban forest, Toronto's beavers are being welcomed as part o f the natural urban environment (Calgary, 1998; Toronto, 2001). Rather than attempt to control the density or location o f its beaver population, the City o f Toronto focuses its management efforts on the protection o f urban forest resources by planting tree species that do not appeal to beavers and deterring harm to those that do (Toronto, 2001). However, it should be noted that the `do nothing' approach is not the equivalent of ignoring a problem that creates real conflicts or risks.

3.4.3

The Needfor a New Approach

Using urban beaver problems as one example, it is clear that municipalities are largely divided not only on how to manage, but also on what to manage. This is often because what is perceived as a nuisance to one person is a benefit to another. As a result, issues surrounding choice o f methods often remain controversial and politically charged (Fall and Jackson, 2002). Furthermore, as naturalization and urban wildlife management is in many ways still in the experimental phase, there is no guarantee that the methods selected will have wide-scale effectiveness. While a variety of methods exist to deter nuisance wildlife, the basic method o f eliminating food, shelter and water is proven effective for all species on a site-specific basis. However, the migratory and opportunistic nature of nuisance wildlife populations means that control activities that are effective at one site will rarely solve a nuisance problem across a larger management area. Uncoordinated management efforts may cause the relocation o f the problem to surrounding areas (Bhat et al., 1996; Belant, 1997). Ironically, uncoordinated wildlife management may also encourage new nuisance species to immigrate into the controlled area to take advantage of reduced resource competition (Bhat et al., 1996). This is further aggravated by an ongoing trend toward the creation of continuity and linkages between natural areas that has been encouraged in southern Ontario, which - while ecologically beneficial - provides enhanced opportunities for wildlife migration (Kanter, 1990; Middleton, 1994). Given this, studies have shown that the optimal management scenario for wildlife nuisances would be to have the control responsibility for human-wildlife conflict management o f the entire problem area delegated to a single, centralized manager (Bhat et ah, 1996; Belant, 1997). The utility o f a centralized landscape approach, "integrating biodiversity issues into mainstream planning, is increasingly appreciated by municipalities... Unfortunately, the link from theory to practice is still very weak" (Middleton, 1994). There is also a growing public interest and participation in resource management decision-making that must be accounted for (Fall and Jackson, 2002). Without a recognized need for coordinated management, decisions regarding human-wildlife conflicts are taken at crisis points rather than at early stages when mitigative intervention and public participation are most effective, resulting in actions that are often extreme and confrontational (EMAN, 2003). Unfortunately, even if management could be coordinated, current wildlife management techniques are not sufficiently adapted to the complexities o f human-wildlife interactions in cities (Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001 ). Some authors have suggested that a cartographic (i,e. GIS) approach is needed to integrate all the different components of human-wildlife interactions. This would allow urban wildlife managers to analyze the spatial distribution o f and connections among humanwildlife interactions in the city, and to identify courses of action (Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001). 23

However, before any map layers can be drawn or decisions made, managers must have sufficient data on the various human and wildlife components o f the conflicts. As will be shown, this type o f information is currently lacking in many municipalities. Due to the complexities o f managing wildlife to control human-wildlife conflicts in urban areas, other authors suggest tliat urban wildlife managers "must change their traditional emphasis from that o f managing population to enhancing wildlife's societal values" (Messmer, 2000). There is also an increased recognition that many human-wildlife conflicts can be resolved by managing the behaviour o f individuals (e.g. encouraging residents to wildlife-proof their home and garbage) rather than the wildlife population itself (Savard, 2000; Fall and Jackson, 2002). Similarly, several studies have found that increased tolerance to urban wildlife is often directly related to the level of understanding that an individual has o f the ecological role that particular species play in the urban environment (Hadidian, 1991; Gibbs, 2001). Understanding the public's perception, interest, values and knowledge o f urban wildlife is key not only to effective public education programs but also to the selection o f viable damage control options. Based on the above discussion, there appears to be three basic things that any municipality can do to better manage human-wildlife conflicts: 1. 2. 3. Increase their knowledge o f the magnitude and public perception o f the conflicts; Increase their knowledge o f urban biodiversity, to address the ecology o f conflicts; and Use the information gained to better plan the location and landscape o f urban natural areas and to enhance residents' willingness to tolerate damage.

The extent to which selected mimicipalities in southern Ontario have recognized the need for and/or have begun to implement these activities has been the focus o f this study. The sections that follow assess the relative effectiveness o f the current human-wildlife management regime established by the selected municipalities based on successes, failures and lessons learned.

PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF URBAN HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICTS

Based on testimony provided during- interviews and municipal documentation^ this section will explore public perceptions o f wildlife in the six selected municipalities, how they are assessed by the municipality and what measures are being, taken to positively influence residents tolerance for wildlife - i.e. public education. 4.1

In 2001, WHC found that "[t]he extent to which urban areas act as wildlife habitats is a reflection o f the human desire to be close to nature, as long as nature does not threaten or inconvenience them". While urbanites have a generally positive attitude towards wildlife, the tension between urban residents and urban wildlife is increasing. During the Summer 2003, barely a day passed without the reporting o f a wildlife conflict incident in the media. This finding has also been supported by several other studies (Fall and Jackson, 2002). An enhanced appreciation o f the origin and dynamic nature o f conflicts may provide valuable insights into potential management strategies that could be designed to increase wildlife's perceived societal value. The success o f such solutions "will largely rest on the ability o f the decision makers and managers to recognize, embrace, and incorporate different stakeholder values, attitudes and beliefs in the policy making, process" (Messmer, 2000). However, this cannot be accomplished if public perceptions are not first assessed and understood. 4.2

Municipal staff from each o f the selected municipalities were asked their professional opinion on how wildlife is perceived by residents within their jurisdiction (see Appendix A). According to those interviewed, urban residents in each o f the selected municipali ties would appear to apply similar terms in developing their perception o f urban wildlife. As shown in Figure 4, most respondents described the relationship between people and wildlife as falling somewhere along- a spectrum o f benefits and nuisances. While perceptions generally tend toward the `benefit' end of the spectrum, individual views range from complete tolerance to complete intolerance. In most cases, the location o f an individual along the spectrum will largely depend on (I) the nature and extent of their personal interactions with urban species; and (2) the degree to which the individual understands the role of native species in urban ecosystems. As a result, wildlife managers in the selected municipalities have found that negative perceptions held by individuals being adversely impacted by wildlife can frequently be improved through the provision o f basic information on the ecological value o f that species in the urban environment. These findings reflect the results o f previous survey-based research conducted in the United States and Canada (O 'Donnell and VanDruff, 1983; Hadidian, 1991; Messmer, 2000). For example, Gibbs (2001) and Gommper (2002) have shown how residential concern regarding the presence o f coyotes can be partially diffused by shifting community focus to the important role coyotes play in the control o f other nuisances, such as small rodents.

Public education

In addition to ecological education, respondents identified a need to raise awareness among residents about how human behaviour can create human-wildlife conflicts or aggravate existing problems. Simple actions such as leaving food outside for pets, improper use o f a composter, or the improper storage o f garbage may attract a whole host o f nuisance species. Fortunately, these actions are also easily avoided. Larger conflicts arise when - due to differences in general perceptions or ecological understanding - residents disagree as to what constitutes a `nuisance'. For instance, despite major conflicts with Canada geese on shorelines across southern Ontario, many individuals continue to inadvertently encourage nesting by feeding the resident goose population. Similarly, while excessive browsing by deer has been identified as a major concern in both the City o f Hamilton and the City o f London, many residents w ith property adjacent to natural areas continue to supply White-tailed deer with supplemental feed during the winter. It is interesting to note that disagreement as to the nature and extent o f nuisance problems is also common among municipal staff. While the ability o f staff to identify areas o f nuisance concern depends in part on their level o f professional or personal exposure to community members that experience human-wildlife conflicts, inability to do so may suggest an important lack o f intermunicipal communication. A t a minimum, municipal staff whose decision-making has a direct influence on human-wildlife interactions should be aware o f nuisance species in their City. This is particularly true in the case o f open space planners, as the decisions that they make regarding the size, shape, location and landscape o f natural habitats can have a large effect on both the immigration o f urban species and the exposure o f people to wildlife (M iddleton, 1994; Johnson, 1995; Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001 ; Fall and Jackson, 2002). During interviews, it was found that m ost staff were generally aware o f the major human-wildlife conflicts that exist in their municipality. Regardless, most municipal wildlife managers and open space planners disliked the use o f the term `nuisance' to describe urban wildlife, preferring to consider any native wildlife as a benefit to urban ecology. It is commonly held that "[t]he creatures w ith which we share our outdoor living space are not intruders, but co-inhabitants" 26

(Pearman, 2004). However, m ost also conceded that in certain cases wildlife can create adverse situations. Unfortunately, compared to ecologists and other wildlife managers, open space planners tended to have a more peripheral knowledge o f the issue. A t one extreme,^ Park and Environmental Planners in Guelph asserted that human-wildlife conflict is not perceived as an issue in their municipality. This is in stark contrast to testimony provided by the staff o f the Grand River Conservation Authority with responsibility for that area.'* Effective urban planning for wildlife co-existence may be further confounded by the actions of developers. Respondents noted that the perceptions o f wildlife held by urban developers are often appreciably different than those o f the individual resident. There is a strong potential for wildlife to create conflict for developers when it is identified as a significant landscape feature during the pre-development environmental assessment process. Despite this, developers are motivated to build in proximity to natural areas as this proximity to nature increases the value o f residential lots. Municipalities tend to support this practice as (1) there are frequently few remaining alternatives for urban expansion and (2) increased property values translate into a stronger tax base (Hudson, 2000). However, while living in proximity to nature will increase the frequency o f positive interactions w ith wildlife, there is also the possibility that it will increase the frequency o f negative interactions. For example, a community survey o f deer browsing habits in an established residential area o f London found that two-thirds o f residents who experience conflicts with the deer had lots that backed directly onto a natural area (London, 2003c), Despite this, not all municipalities have yet recognized the importance o f mitigating the negative wildlife interactions that may result from expanded residential development. Municipalities that have taken mitigative action commonly rely on two approaches - public education to increase residential tolerance for co-existence with nature and the creation o f landscape buffers between the natural areas and development. These options will be discussed further in Section 4.4 and 6.5 respectively. 4.3
E v a lu a tin g P u b lic P e rc e p tio n s o f W ild lif e

From responses received as a result o f inquiry under Section 4.2, it is clear that wildlife and open space managers believe that they have a sound understanding o f the public perceptions o f wildlife in their municipality. However, as seen in Table 3, there have been few actual attempts to assess these perceptions. O f the six municipalities examined, only the City o f M ississauga was found to have a formalized system for monitoring residents' concerns regarding wildlife.

'^Potential reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed further in Section 6.5.1.

/ / - Wildlife-specific initiatives;

/ - General environment initiatives

According to those interviewed, information on public perceptions o f wildlife is derived from a wide variety o f sources. However, the actual evaluation o f these perceptions was based primarily on anecdotal evidence or was extrapolated from other general environmental policy initiatives. For example, respondents that were the direct recipients o f residential complaints stated that they keep an informal log o f the number and nature o f calls received related both to wildlife and the general management o f open spaces. However, this information is o f limited use as it is generally neither aggregated by the individual for monitoring purposes nor shared among City staff. The exception to this is the City o f Mississauga Animal Services Department where, since 1996, there has been a full-time staff member dedicated to the monitoring o f residential nuisance species complaints received via telephone or e-mail. This enhanced coordination allows staff to aggregate data on an annual basis and generate statistics, effectively allowing the municipality to respond to questions concerning not only which species are involved in human-wildlife conflicts, but also where and when conflicts occur, and the nature o f the problems that these species create. Access to aggregate information not only improves the ability o f the municipality to react to residents' concerns on a timely basis but, as seen in Figure 5, this data is also useful for monitoring long term trends in the effectiveness o f nuisance management programs. Mississauga currently maintains year-end statistics for the twelve most common urban nuisance species in the City, with all bird species combined into one general categoiy. All other species are included in the data as `miscellaneous'. Numerical data are also supported by detailed notes that help to explain possible causes behind fluctuations in the overall trends, such as weather patterns, instances o f wildlife disease (i.e. rabies, mange, distemper, etc.), or media interest in an issue.

Figure 5 displays the overall trend in wildlife species calls received by Animal Services in Mississauga between 1995 and 2002, as well as that for the two most commonly reported species and the `miscellaneous' grouping o f species. As can be seen, there has been an overall decline in the total number o f calls received. This decline is attributed by staff to an important shift in program delivery that was implemented in 1994 (see Section 4.4.5), Among all species being tracked, only the `miscellaneous' category continues to show an upward trend in the number o f calls received/ This trend may suggest a need for Animal Services to amend its new system o f program delivery in order to increase its effectiveness in addressing general nuisances. Conversely, it may be an indicator o f the effectiveness o f Animal Services recent initiatives to raise awareness o f nuisance species management among residents. Provided that decision-makers are aware o f and have easy access to the resulting data, a formalized system for the collection, aggregation and analysis o f nuisance complaints received by municipal staff via telephone or e-mail may represent a municipal best management practice.®

®An exception to the overall trend is also observed for the year 2002. In part, this can be attributed to a heightened concern over West Nile Virus and a year of particularly severe weather conditions that resulted in a large number o f unusual calls. Data coordination was also improved as this was the first year that one full-time education officer was the sole respondent to residents' concerns. ®In Mississauga, data exist and are shared upon request but is not readily accessible for City-wide use. Staff o f the Credit Valley Conservation Authority and mimicipal staff outside o f Animal Services were unaware of the existence o f the data.

W ith a bit of enhanced coordination, it allows the municipality to use readily available information to understand public perceptions and react to community concerns before they can evolve into crisis situations. However, even if demands for access to information can be met, this system is still subject to other shortcomings as an evaluation tool for public perceptions as the information collected does not represent a random sample o f the population. A system that only monitors complaints w ill capture the opinion o f those most adversely affected by nuisances while effectively ignoring the views o f any residents with more positive perceptions o f wildlife. As a more representative alternative, public surveys are often used by municipalities as a means o f evaluating general public perceptions towards various issues affecting the City. For example, recent surveys were conducted in conjunction with the development of: City o f London Parks and Recreation Strategic M aster Plan (2003-2007); Imagine! Waterloo 2020 Community Vision (2001); City o f Hamilton Parks, Culture and Recreation Master Plan (2002); and City o f Guelph Terrestrial Inventory o f Open Spaces (upcoming).

· · ·

Community survey processes and broad community consultations are also common as part o f the master planning process and the development o f municipal strategic directions. Drawing off these formal studies, several respondents stated that their evaluation o f public perceptions o f wildlife was extrapolated from public surveys conducted in conjunction with other municipal community consultation processes. In most cases, the surveys found that residents had a high affinity for wildlife and the protection o f natural open spaces and/or would like to see these resources increased within the City. However, none o f these studies included any questions specifically related to human-wildlife conflict. The City of London is a notable exception. During the summer o f 2000, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) and the City o f London began to receive a num ber o f calls from residents of the Sifton Bog community regarding frequent sightings o f and conflicts with W hite-tailed deer. In 2001, the Sifton Bog W hite-tailed Deer Community Steering Committee initiated a survey o f residents living in close proximity to the Bog as a means o f determining the extent o f deer damage to private landowners. O f close to 800 surveys mailed, 255 were returned.' In addition to identifying the type, extent and location o f private property damage, the survey found that: · The majority o f residents (approx. 69%) felt that the deer presented a problem for the community, even though only a small proportion (28%) were currently being directly affected. W hile about h alf o f those not currently impacted had never seen the deer in their yards at all, 41% feared that the deer would be a problem for them in the future. Deer activity appeared to be related to human behaviour and landscaping choice; inhibited by dogs and fenced yards and encouraged by the presence o f fruit trees and bird feeders. However, only about 1 in 5 households had made some attempt at deer proofing. These

measures were typically reactive rather than proactive, and were not seen to be highly effective. The health o f the Bog and the health o f the deer were cited as the greatest concerns for the community, followed by human health and safety. Damage to vegetation was only a major concern for those that had already been directly impacted.

A s can be seen, the results of this survey have provided decision-makers with valuable information as to the real nature o f the problem and how this is perceived by residents. Combined with the conclusions o f a management options review, this information allowed the Community Steering Committee to prepare recommendations for the resolution o f the problem that reflected not only scientific and economic feasibility but also community values. W hether the recommendations will be accepted by the community as a whole remains to be seen (London, 2003c). However, perhaps o f greater importance than the findings themselves is the possible precedent that this survey and the broader community consultation process set for future wildlife management discussions in the City. In its Final Report (2003), the Community Steering Committee notes that "conclusions reached... may influence how problems o f a similar nature would be handled at other natural areas within the City o f London" . According to one respondent, a similar Community Steering Committee is already being formed for the development o f informed management decisions regarding Canada geese.

4.3.1 Tracking `Nuisances' via Ecological Monitoring
Human-wildlife conflicts that occur in urban areas are frequently the result o f locally over abundant wildlife populations, such as is the case with the White-tailed deer in London and Canada geese throughout most o f southern Ontario. These species can not only create public nuisances, but may also be a concern for the ecological health o f the area in which they are found. A s a result, among the actual studies o f urban nuisance species that do take place, it would appear that the majority are performed for the purpose o f ecological monitoring rather than to evaluate public perceptions. For example, studies have been initiated to evaluate the ecological impact of overabundant gull, goose and cormorant populations in the Hamilton Harbour area and the success o f various control measures to mitigate these impacts. As a result, any complaints regarding these species are referred to a committee that has been set up in the Hamilton Region for the purpose of nuisance bird control. There are also several occasions where nuisance wildlife tracking is performed as a result of legislation. Ln these instances, tracking is generally performed by agencies outside the municipal government. For example, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources maintains statistics on both the number o f deer removal permits issued and the number o f deer-vehicle collisions sustained in a given area. Staff o f Conservation Authorities record instances o f beaver or beaver dam removal and removal requests for tracking by the OMNR. Similarly, the Canadian Wildlife Service maintains statistics on the number o f egg oiling permits issued for migratory bird species. Transport Canada maintains annual statistics on the number and severity o f aircraft collisions that involve wildlife (Blackwell, 2003.07.16). Again, while these studies do not include information that would help improve municipal understanding o f public perceptions, they may provide other valuable information that is critical to 31

effective municipal management (e.g. data on the location and extent of specific nuisance problems). Some of this information is also used by higher levels o f government to develop and distribute nuisance management education to municipalities faced with particular problems - e.g. The Beaver Handbook: A Guide to Understanding and Coping with Beaver Activity (D 'eon et al., 1995). Despite this, it was generally found that municipalities lack the information needed to take proactive action on diffusing nuisance situations. In most cases, monitoring o f either the ecological or public impact o f nuisance species occurs only after tiiey have reached a crisis level. This limits the number o f options available to the municipality to reactive measures, many o f which are often extreme, non-adaptive and lead to public confrontation (EMAN, 2003).

There are many means o f mitigating public concern over nuisance species before problems reach crisis level. Information and education are important for the development o f an appreciation of nature among Canada's expanding urban population, many of whom have never lived close to nature (WHC, 2001). As many urban wildlife problems are often either directly or indirectly created by humans, human behaviour modification and enhancing tolerance for urban wildlife are considered prime strategies for dealing with present and future conflicts (Messmer, 2000; Fall and Jackson, 2002). As stated by Hadidian (1991), "[p]erhaps the most demanding task facing us is educating the urban populace, not only in regard to the cause and resolution o f urban wildlife problems, but also in regard to the ecological basis of these". Targeted education and awareness programs, combined with improved access to relevant urban biodiversity information, will allow individuals to make more informed decisions about nuisance species control and management on their own land and in the municipality as a whole (WHC, 2001). Table 4 outlines some o f the most common public education initiatives delivered by the selected municipalities. As can be seen in the Table, most municipalities actively conduct some form of public education aimed at improving general environmental awareness. However, a much smaller proportion of these municipal or Conservation Authority programs are directly targeted at issues related to human-wildlife conflict mitigation or resolution.

As will be discussed, while each o f the selected municipalities may use a similar set o f tools for the delivery o f public environmental education, the nature and substance of the programs delivered varies substantially.

4.4.1

Media, Print and On-line Resources

As demonstrated in Section 3.3, issues of biodiversity and urban wildlife now receive a reasonable share of attention in the media. Reporting on events o f interest to Canadians, media reports are more frequent when urban wildlife has created a problem that affects a large section o f the population. This is true o f the Sifton Bog White-tailed deer problem and the more general problem of overabundant Canada geese in southern Ontario. Upon request, most municipalities will provide the media with the information they require to accurately report on these issues. As such, the media can be used as a resource to distribute municipal information regarding wildlife issues to the public at virtually no cost to the municipality. Unfortunately, by focusing on the high profile issues, media reports do not reflect the true distribution of nuisance problems within a municipality or region. This is because there are some nuisances - such as mice or raccoons - that are so common that they are generally no longer reported on as nuisances. However, due to their wide audience, it has been found that media reports not only reflect attitudes toward urban wildlife but can also be used to help to develop these perceptions (Vuorisalo et al., 2001). For example, the City of Mississauga Animal Services takes advantage of the local newspaper to publish a regular editorial on wildlife in the city, providing tips to residents on nuisance species control. Despite this opportunity for information sharing, most municipalities do not yet have ready access to use o f the media for these purposes. For municipalities such as the City o f London and the City of Burlington, media coverage is limited to updates on issues o f importance - for example, progress on naturalization projects or the management of specific nuisance species - in newsletters produced by the municipality. By contrast, the majority o f municipalities now have either print and/or on-line resources available to inform residents about wildlife in the city. These publications are perhaps more effective as they are directly targeted at addressing the nuisance problems o f greatest importance to the local municipality, but are also limited by a somewhat weaker distribution than media reports. Print materials being distributed by the municipal government and/or the Conservation Authority range from basic one-page educational fact sheets to more detailed brochures, up to approximately thirty pages in length. The most common themes for these materials include health and safety concerns (e.g. rabies and WNV), naturalization, by-law and provincial law enforcement, identification of wildlife in the city, and human-wildlife conflict management techniques. For the latter, emphasis is given to those species responsible for the highest proportion o f nuisance complaints - coyotes, waterfowl, pigeons, foxes, deer, raccoons, skunks, squirrels, rodents, flocking birds and weeds. A typical information brochure will include biological infonnation on the species o f concern to help residents identify the nuisance, will identify normal versus abnormal behaviour for the species (i.e. identify when health risks may be present or real conflict a potential), and will provide suggestions as to how to legally and humanely prevent or resolve conflicts. Other information packages will focus more generally on measures for home and community wild-proofing, such as proper waste disposal and the importance o f not feeding wildlife. 33

In the case o f print and electronic materials, there is also strong evidence of resource sharing among municipalities. The Animal Services Division o f the City o f Toronto Public Health Department is cited on several occasions as the original source o f information. The City of Hamilton collaborates with the City o f Burlington's Animal Control for resource access, except for issues related to public health (e.g. WNV) or by-law enforcement. This practice o f resource sharing should be encouraged where common problems exist in order to make the best use of scarce municipal resources. Resource sharing could also help provide residents with enhanced electronic access to information by alleviating the limitations in bandwidth size of municipal websites. However, municipalities are still encouraged to develop their own information materials to fill resource gaps.

Interpretive Programs

In southern Ontario, Conservation Authorities appear to be key in the provision o f general environmental education through interpretive programming. Created by the Ontario Conservation Authorities Act in 1946, part of the mandate of these watershed-based agencies is to develop and deliver education and information programs to the public with a goal to establish a higher standard of co-existence between the community and the local environment. To accomplish this, the designated Conservation Areas present in each o f the selected municipalities are treated as "outdoor schoolrooms" where the public can learn the ecological, social and economic value of their natural environment (CO, 2000a). On an annual basis, close to one million students participate in either on- or off-site environmental education programs delivered by Conservation Authorities across Ontario (CO, 2000b). Similar educational opportunities are available to adults who visit Conservation Areas or participate in commimity events with an environmental component. As is the case with the City o f Mississauga, some interpretive programs are also delivered by the municipal government either independent o f or in conjunction with the local Conservation Authority. While this is an impressive accomplishment, the delivery o f these interpretive programs limits their use as educational tools due to a weak distribution o f information among the general population exposure is limited to a select number of individuals (or their parents). Other than the relatively fixed school-age audience, it is difficult to target educational programs to where they are needed most.® Among adults, the information provided primarily reaches those who already have a relatively high affinity for nature, as demonstrated by their presence at the Conservation Area or community event. In addition, while learning respect for urban wildlife may be a component of the general environmental education program, the interpretive programming generally does not specifically target the issue o f nuisance wildlife or human-wildlife conflict management.

4.4.3

Signage

Another, more passive but still practical approach towards the distribution o f general environmental education in natural areas is the erection o f signs. As seen in Table 5, municipal

While formal education (i.e. school curriculum) is an important component of community awareness, it has been excluded from this analysis as it is an issue o f provincial jurisdiction. Most municipalities have now recognized the need to enhance local environmental education in schools.

Nature of Information Provided
Signage planned to advise residents not to feed waterfowl; will include ecological basis for warning - currently at sample wording stage. Signage discourages encroachment by identifying natural areas adjacent to new developments (mandatory) and increases tolerance through the identification o f naturalization projects. Signage program will educate public if unusual techniques are being applied to a natural area e.g. herbicides being used on invasive wildflowers. Interpretive signage being planned for natural areas adjacent to new developments, but delayed due to budgetary constraints - no formal sign design yet exists. Signage discourages residents from negative interactions with natural areas (e.g. encroachment) and/or dispel negative perceptions of naturalization projects as municipal negligence. Signage used to identify trails through natural areas and keep residents on track, but do not provide interpretive information - part of Waterloo Trails Master Plan. Planned installation of interpretive signs along some trails to explain natural features. Signage in natural areas restricted to by-law enforcement (e.g. no dumping, no encroachment, etc.). Interpretive signage discontinued due to vandalism concerns.

As an education technique, signs placed in natural areas or on naturalization projects gain effectiveness by targeting residents who use or live in proximity to specific sites. The information they provide may be highly valuable in raising public perceptions o f naturalization projects, particularly during the juvenile stage when they appear the most unkept. Signs are also useful reminders to residents that certain human behaviours (such as wildlife feeding) may encourage nuisances.
®This table excludes signage maintained by Conservation Authorities in designated Conservation Areas as part o f their mandate for environmental education.

However, there are also several factors that limit the feasibility and effectiveness o f tlris educational technique. Though reaching a target population, signs are limited in the amount o f information they can provide. In addition, signs are not only costly to introduce but may also be costly to maintain. The City o f London found such programs to be unsustainable following several incidences o f vandalism and has now discontinued any signage in natural areas that is not specifically required for by-law enforcement. Similarly, other municipalities have limited the number o f signs erected due to cost restraints.

4.4.4 Subdivision Agreements
As discussed in Section 4.2, there is a current trend towards the construction o f new residential developments in proximity to natural areas. Having recognized this, the majority o f municipalities examined now require that developers distribute educational material to all new residents as part o f subdivision agreements. While this material is focused on the environment as a whole, most packages will refer to specific urban wildlife issues (see Table 6). The majority o f materials encourage close interactions with urban wildlife through landscaping or other stewardship practices (e.g. prevention o f encroachment), though many also address the potential for humanwildlife conflicts on residential property.

The fact that the majority o f these educational materials emphasize the positive aspects o f humanwildlife interactions should not be considered as a negative feature o f such programs. Positive perceptions o f wildlife and an improved understanding of its ecological value have been demonstrated to increase tolerance for conflicts and the capacity to co-exist. At present, this may represent a municipal best management practice. However, as suggested by one respondent, the long-term effectiveness o f this practice is still in question. While the initial purchaser will receive valuable information as to how to co-exist and mitigate conflicts with the abutting natural area, this resident likely already has a high affinity for nature as demonstrated by their selection of lot location. By contrast, it is subsequent purchasers (with a potentially less-well developed affinity for nature) who do not receive the information package that may pose the greatest risk to the adjacent natural area. In part, this risk can be mitigated by the additional on line availability o f the majority o f these resources. However, as will be discussed in Section 6.5.3, the establishment of municipal guidelines that encourage developers to take urban wildlife into consideration during residential building design may be a more effective solution.

4.4.5

Public Education BMP: City o f Mississauga

In 1994, the City of Mississauga Animal Services Department made an innovative shift in program deliveiy that has had a significant positive impact on nuisance species management. Rather than the traditional form o f direct, on-ground management. Animal Services now relies almost exclusively on public education as the primary human-wildlife conflict resolution tool. 37

As a result, the City o f Mississauga was found to be the only selected municipality to have a comprehensive program for public education devoted to wildlife in the City. This program is composed o f a number o f elements, including but not limited to: 1. Staff Education - Staff education and the development o f comprehensive in-house information resources are considered critical components in ensuring municipal capacity to respond to resident inquiries and complaints in a timely manner. A review o f municipal experiences and research into best management practices for the effective resolution and prevention of conflicts have allowed the City to improve service delivery Telephone Counseling - Municipal experience has shown that many questions can be answered over the telephone. The Mississauga Animal Control Wildlife Trouble Shooting Guide (1995) was developed to assist dispatchers and other staff members in responding to public concerns regarding wildlife. The guide presents information on more than a dozen common urban wildlife species and provides advice on the basis o f the many situations in which the wildlife may be encountered or create conflict. As would be expected, the type and level of advice required differs significantly for general sightings than it would for, for example, home invasions. More unusual wildlife concerns are to be directed to an on-staff wildlife representative for advice. Residential Visits - Telephone counseling and the provision o f education materials are now considered by the City to be the first course o f action when contacted regarding wildlife conflicts. The decreased reliance on residential visits has significantly reduced the on ground costs to the municipality associated with nuisance management. However, in the case o f an emergency where an animal is in immediate danger or causing a dangerous situation, an Animal Control Officer will still be dispatched. Property visits allow Animal Control Officers to better estimate the severity o f the problem, and advise or educate the resident accordingly. While other municipalities may still lend or rent out traps as part of their community support. Animal Control does not provide wildlife removal services and no longer supports trapping approaches." Where necessary, residents may be referred to credible wildlife removal companies in order to deal with specific problems. Many private wildlife removal companies have been established in the City to help fill the gap left by Animal Services. Distribution o f Print Resources - A wide variety o f print resources are now available for hand-out or mail-out distribution, as required. Some o f these resources have been developed in-house (based on community need and best available information) while others are collected for distribution from respected external agencies with an interest in urban wildlife management, such as the Canadian Federation o f Humane Societies. Print resources include information on issues such as wildlife proofing, choosing a wildlife removal company and understanding legislation, as well as specific information on the identification and control o f common urban nuisance wildlife species.

Distribution o f Internet Resources - Access to information resources has recently been simplified and expedited through the use o f the internet. Resources provided on-line by Animal Services are a reflection o f the print resources that have been developed and feature similar information. This service has been positively received by residents o f Mississauga, and the number o f dispatch calls has declined as more people access the information they need on-line. In order to improve service delivery. Animal Services is now designing an internet poll o f their site to get a better sense o f their ability to meet the demand for information that can be delivered via the internet. Media Coverage - Animal Services publishes a regular editorial article in The Mississauga News (a local community newspaper), to provide residents with information on City wildlife and wildlife management techniques. This is in addition to newsletter update contributions and the response to specific media requests for information on wildlife issues of wide-scale public importance or general public interest. Response to Community Requests - At the request of schools and other community groups. Animal Services will occasionally prepare and present information on urban wildlife issues and the role o f the City. Information provided during these sessions is tailored to the needs o f the group making the request and will often include information on the other functions o f Animal Services, such as domestic pet control. Targeted Information Delivery - The statistics that are collected by Animal Services in connection with its call complaints monitoring system (see Section 4.3) allow staff to assess species and spaces o f particular concern within the City. Once identified, local situations can often be diffused through a targeted mail-out o f educational material and/or door-to-door visits by Animal Control Officers. Information delivery is usually completed at the request o f or with assistance from the office o f the City Councillor with jurisdiction over that section o f the City. Similarly, major issues perceived to be o f wide-spread concern may be addressed by targeted information sessions open to the general public. For example, when the residents' concern regarding urban coyotes escalated in 19951996, a series o f public infoimation sessions were conducted to educate the public and raise awareness about municipal initiatives to monitor and control coyote activity. Organized and delivered in conjunction with other municipalities from across the Greater Toronto Area, the large community turn-out to these sessions helped to diffuse the situation.

Have the City o f Mississauga's public education efforts been successful? As was seen in Figure 5, the first year o f the public education program was the most difficult due to the need for adjustment by both stafl^ and the community to the new service delivery approach. However, despite an increase in the urban population o f both humans and wildlife, the number of wildliferelated calls received by Animal Services have been almost steadily in decline. According to Mississauga, credit for this decline can be attributed to the ability o f their public education program to increase wildlife tolerance and positively modify human behaviour that creates potential conflicts. Unfortunately, while it is supported by anecdotal evidence no formal study of program effectiveness has yet been conducted to test this theory.

As even the m ost comprehensive public education program has yet to conduct an assessment for effectiveness, it is difficult to develop specific recommendations for best management practices in human-wildlife conflict management from this review o f municipal practices. Stakeholders from each o f the selected municipalities cited a lack o f human and financial resources as the major impediment to program review, with program development and implementation considered as more critical expenditures o f scarce resources. There is some indication that " [pjublic education in the form o f signs, pamphlets and public announcements has varying degrees o f success" (Henshaw, 1997). As stated by Henshaw (1997), program success is tied to the presence/absence o f language barriers, the amount o f enforcement, and the extent o f pre-existing public understanding o f the link between human behaviour and ecology. These factors ai'e particularly important in the multicultural environment that is southern Ontario, where not only language but also cultural perspectives may significantly alter an individuals' view o f urban wildlife (O 'Donell and VanDruff, 1983; Gobster, 2001; WHC, 2001). As a result, in order to develop effective public education programs, it is clear that municipalities must first imderstand how residents perceive urban wildlife and have a basic understanding o f the issues that they face related to human-wildlife conflicts. Currently, while wildlife and open space managers believe that they have a sound understanding o f the public perceptions o f wildlife in their municipality, there have been few actual attempts to assess these perceptions. The City o f Mississauga's complaint monitoring system may be viewed as a model for understanding and reacting to community wildlife concerns before they reach crisis level. Knowing where conflicts arise and which species are likely involved also allows the City to target public education efforts to where they are needed most, both mitigating conflicts before they become major problems and making the best use o f scarce resources. Public education programs that are developed should incorporate both ecological and human behaviour components. This is needed to not only increase tolerance towards wildlife but ensure that a level o f more harmonious co-existence can be reached. The information provided should also be easily accessible, understandable and relevant to local conditions. Such as is done with the Subdivision Agreements, proactive measures to reduce the frequency o f conflicts should be promoted whenever possible. More than identifying problems or providing general tips, information should also be available to residents that suggests a course o f action when reactive measures are required. Resources should be shared among municipalities facing similar problems so that more municipalities can develop a multi-faceted approach to public education delivery, such as that which is applied by the City o f Mississauga. If effectively delivered, public education and awareness programs will enable urban residents to make more informed decisions about their interactions with wildlife. In turn, these positive perceptions o f urban wildlife and urban wildlife habitat may have spin-off implications - both in terms o f economic and political decisions - for the conservation o f nature in other landscapes (Middleton, 1994; WHC, 2001).

M UNICIPAL CAPACITY FOR BIODIVERSITY SCIENCE & INFORMATION

In order to effectively manage human-wildlife conflicts, the conflicts must first be understood. In addition to public input and awareness, planning for human-wildlife conflicts is a process that uses scientific, socioeconomic and technical data. For effective management, ecological data and analysis m ust be available to and be understood by those who will be affected by the decisions being made (EMAN, 2003). Unfortunately, Canadian cities continue to suffer from a relati ve lack o f urban biological data and predictive ability (M iddleton, 1994, WHC, 2001). Included in this is a deficiency o f data necessary for making decisions on most human-wildlife conflicts (Messmer, 2000; Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001). Currently, "[f]ew public stakeholders understand how human-wildlife conflicts are created, let alone the m ost environmentally correct way to manage the problem" (Messmer, 2000). To develop effective urban solutions, there is now a critical need for information on the location, behaviour and abundance o f particular nuisance species and environmental settings where damage or conflicts are known to occur (Fall and Jackson, 2002). Based on testimony provided during interviews and municipal documentation, this section will explore the development and use o f biodiversity science and information in the six selected municipalities, what initiatives are currently taking place, and their effectiveness for humanwildlife conflicts.

W hat is the nature o f the information needed to make decisions? How can we develop and use biodiversity information to better guide local growth and development decisions? These are the questions that communities need to ask in order to make sustainable choices for development and in the day-to-day lives o f residents. Basic research on the social and economic values associated with wildlife can help determine what kinds o f habitats urban residents desire within their urban area, with a view to integrating those values into the planning process (W HC, 2001). This issue was addressed in Section 4. However, studies have also found that there is a need for basic scientific research associated with biodiversity in urban habitats (Middleton, 1994; WHC, 2001). "On the scientific side, developing a better quantitative understanding o f the interactions between species and their homes will help bring better information to land use decision-making" (WHC, 2001). Currently, when human-wildlife conflicts arise in an urban area, a lack o f good information results in a lack o f consensus on how to deal with the problem (MDNR, 2002). In many cases, this leads communities to spend excessive time collecting information which, coupled with the lack o f an advanced warning system, means that data are provided too late to avoid or mitigate major problems (EMAN, 2003). Options are limited when decisions are taken at crisis points, and this results in reactionary measures that are extreme, confrontational and not designed for adaptive management.

According to EMAN (2003)? environmental information required for community-based decision making should be: targeted and relevant to local problems; accessible and understandable to the audience; integrated; usable in both form and context; and timely. This means that knowledge needs to be driven by what information is needed, and not just what is easily accessible. As will be seen, this is not the case in the majority o f selected municipalities. However, simply finding better ways to provide scientific information will not result in better decisions. This is due to the fundamental difference between the generation o f information and the creation o f knowledge. To be useful, the information gathered m ust also be organized in such a way that it will actually allow the user to make knowledgeable decisions, i.e. it suggests a course of action and/or allows decision makers to weigh possible outcomes and feel that they are in control o f the problem (EMAN, 2003). While this Section will focus on municipal capacity for basic research into urban biodiversity, it should be recalled that there are a broad range o f other issues for which knowledge deficiencies exist. Some examples include: the impacts o f overabundant species on other natural resources and the environment; the extent o f urban forestry losses associated with species (e.g. beavers); the ability o f species to newly adapt to human-altered environments (e.g. coyotes); the incidence o f human disease for which wildlife may play a role in transmission; the magnitude and consequences o f deer-vehicle collisions; the prevalence and consequence o f bird-aircraft or bird-structure collisions; and the general ecology o f nuisance species and their dynamics in urban areas (e.g. roosting, feeding, nesting, colonization patterns, times o f year when present, etc.) Enhanced knowledge in any or all of these areas could move national, provincial and particularly local governments towards the development o f a system to efficiently allocate resources and effectively manage human-wildlife conflicts (Messmer, 2000).

Before we can analyse the effectiveness o f municipal biodiversity information for human-wildlife conflict, we must first examine the type o f science and monitoring that is currently taking place. During interviews, each of the relevant stakeholders was asked what type o f information on open spaces and wildlife is currently available for use by the municipality in planning and operations. The results o f this inquiry are found summarized in Table 7.

As can be seen from Table 1, each o f the six selected municipalities is currently involved in some amount o f biodiversity science and biodiversity science-related initiatives. Even so, is this science and monitoring data being turned into useful information for biodiversity and/or human-wildlife conflict management? Answers to this question will be outlined in the following sections. 5.2.1 Watershed and Sub-w atershed Studies

Under the Conservation Authorities Act (1946), Ontario's Conservation Authorities share a mandate for the protection, management and restoration o f watershed resources. This includes not only aquatic but also terrestrial resources - woodlands, wetlands and other natural habitat. However, " [sjuccessful management strategies can only be developed if accurate and representative information on the watershed characteristics and dynamics are available" (PEIL, 2003). Watershed studies contribute to this goal by gathering information on the watershed that is required for environmentally sound policy development. While each Conservation Authority may gear its methods to its own particular conditions, there are essentially three phases to any watershed study (GRCA, 1993; CVC, 2003): 1. Phase I involves the characterization o f the watershed and its existing environmental and water resource processes (e.g. hydrology, water quality, stream morphology, aquatic and terrestrial resources, land use, etc.). This phase may also include public input to set the community's vision and goals for the study and/or watershed. Phase II assesses the potential impacts o f future changes in land use. This phase can also be used to develop and assess alternatives to help protect the environment. Phase III results in the development o f a management strategy for the watershed. This is frequently the result o f the selection o f a preferred alternative future (identified during Phase II). A series o f actions w ill then be recommended to achieve the future watershed goal. The management strategy will consist o f a schedule for the completion o f these actions, including the assignment o f responsibilities, suggestion o f implementation costs, and measures that can be used to monitor progress.

M ost important to this thesis research is Phase I. This phase includes activities such as the collection o f primary and secondaiy data, modeling, and the analysis o f data. Based on an ecosystem approach, analysis for watershed studies includes an examination o f individual components as well as the interrelationship among elements. Terrestrial resource components o f these studies include elements such as a categorization o f vegetation communities, delineation o f wetland boundaries, identification o f significant wildlife habitat, and the identification o f significant or rare wildlife communities (GRCA, 1993; PEIL, 2003). This inform ation can also be mapped against or used to identify Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) or other components o f an existing and/or proposed greenspace system. As a result o f provincial guidelines, the Conservation Authorities for all six o f the selected municipalities have now completed a watershed study for their management area. These highly comprehensive documents are used extensively by both Conservation Authorities and municipal government for the purposes o f land use planning. Some municipalities, such as the City o f Waterloo, currently rely almost exclusively on these studies (and their associated monitoring programs) as a source o f planning information. However, the Credit River watershed drains an area o f approximately 1,000 km^, with 1,500 km o f tributaries (CVC, 2003). Even this expanse is dwarfed by the Grand River watershed, which includes an area greater than 7,000 km^ (GRCA, 1993). The size o f each watershed means that the watershed studies can only really offer municipal planners a generalized, landscape level assessment o f the local environment. This leaves obvious gaps in information required to answer questions about small, site specific wildlife issues. To help address these information gaps, the Conservation Authorities have subdivided each watershed into sub-watershed components based on important tributaries. For example, the Credit Valley Conservation Authority has identified the need to break down the study area o f the Credit River watershed into 20 subwatersheds (CVC, 2003). Though smaller than the watershed, these subwatersheds can still cover a significant area Important to planning in W aterloo, the Laurel Creek subwatershed includes an area o f approximately 74 kra^ (GRCA, 1993). Subwatershed studies are similar in methodology and content to watershed studies, but provide a finer resolution o f information that is more useful for local planning. Subwatershed studies also outline the monitoring requirements necessary to allow for development to occur. Conducted in conjunction with the local Conservation Authority, these studies are more often the responsibility o f both the development industry and the municipality. Table 7 lists the subwatershed studies for each o f the selected municipalities as being in progress or partially complete. This is because while some subwatersheds have been thoroughly studied, others have not. As o f 2003, the Credit Valley Conservation Authority had only completed 17 o f the 20 required studies (CVC, 2003). There are larger gaps in areas where subwatershed studies do not follow such a systematic approach but are completed on more o f an as needed basis, often subject to the will o f Council. For example, in Waterloo, there are no subwatershed studies that have been conducted in areas not scheduled for development. Lastly, several other watershed and subwatershed studies are now in need o f an update, with data being up to 20 years old.

5.2.2

Environmental Monitoring

As stated in Section 5.2.1, monitoring programs associated with watershed studies and subwatershed studies are currently a major source o f planning information for municipalities in the study area. However^ the relative utility o f monitoring information means th at these programs are also conducted in conjunction w ith a much wider variety o f activities. "The role o f monitoring is to measure the success at which resource managers can, in this case, conserve the biological integrity o f terrestrial ecosystems" (Morris, 2002). While monitoring initiatives differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there are several key characteristics that are common to all effective programs. The process begins with the identification o f program objectives, the selection o f relevant scientific indicators and collection o f baseline data based on these parameters. As an assessment o f progress towards a particular target, a good indicator should be easily measured. Examples o f indicators used in terrestrial monitoring programs o f selected municipalities are shown in Table 8. Table 8: Examples o f Terrestrial Monitoring Indicators, Selected Municipalities

As it would be impossible to continuously monitor every environmental aspect within the urban ecosystem, indicators must be used. However, careful consideration must be given to the selection o f meaningful indicators. In particular, "[ejnvironmental indicators have to be based on the delivery o f the information needed, not the data that is [sic] easily collected" (EMAN, 2003). While information provided by the Christmas Bird Count is easily accessible (see Table 8), it is likely not the most meaningful nor accurate measure o f ecological sensitivity and habitat protection. 45

As part of an ongoing process, these indicators are then measured at regular intervals, such as on a daily, monthly, seasonal or annual basis. This periodic measurement allows for the identification o f trends which would indicate positive and negative changes in the ecosystem. Similar to the selection of indicators, the measurement interval must be logically connected to the monitoring objectives. For example, data collected on urban wildlife must take into consideration seasonal variations in species breeding and migration patterns. Bird counts taken only in the summer months or during the day may not capture important bird roosting behaviour observed during the spring and fall migrations or at night (Burlington, 2002). Once collected, monitoring data are then documented and analysed to determine trends, areas of management success and areas requiring improvement or corrective action. Assessment o f environmental conditions based on these data are integral to the process o f making effective management decisions. First and foremost, monitoring allows for a municipality to effectively implement adaptive planning and management. Adaptive planning is an approach to management that is characterized by a continuous cycle o f flexible planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and adjustment according to lessons learned (PEIL, 2003). Monitoring assists in this cycle by assessing and integrating this scientific knowledge into revised planning strategies. However, terrestrial wildlife monitoring can also have numerous other benefits for planning and management within a municipality. It can be used to locate sensitive areas and to develop an understanding of wildlife patterns and natural corridor use. This knowledge is then applied to the development and implementation of future resource management policy. Monitoring can also be used as an early warning detection system, making problem detection possible before serious damage occurs. Despite the known benefits, a review o f the six selected municipalities found that terrestrial monitoring tends to be far less extensive than aquatic or riparian monitoring. Systematic wildlife surveys are viewed as being extremely time consuming and costly, as the mobility o f most terrestrial species makes it difficult to obtain a clear picture o f their distribution. This is further complicated by the general suggestion that, as most open space decisions are based on habitat distribution rather than wildlife distribution, there is no real need to know the location or population density o f each species. Reasons for which this may be a fallacious assumption will be discussed in Section 5.2.1. In addition, it was found that the majority o f terrestrial monitoring activities are undertaken by the local Conservation Authorities. As a result, in most cases, it would appear that terrestrial conditions are only o f interest for monitoring in so far as they are an important determining factor for water quality and quantity. As such, terrestrial species monitoring is often limited to habitat density, vegetation, land birds, amphibians and rare species. Indicators tend to relate to the presence/absence o f species based on inexact site observations. More meaningful quantitative data is rare. The biomonitoring that does occur is infrequent, often conducted less than twice per year. This is an insufficient interval given species movement and temporal behaviour variations. One of the greatest impediments to the monitoring o f biodiversity is cost. The easy-to-quantify costs but often difficult-to-quantify benefits of environmental programs and scientific studies mean that these initiatives are often negatively impacted during times o f budgetary constraint. 46

However, the experience o f agencies involved in monitoring has revealed its inherent value. According to Waterloo (n.d.), this inherent value includes benefits in the form of environmental and human health, quality o f life for residents, relationships and partnerships with various agencies, and project efficiencies. Data generated through monitoring allow a municipality to identify areas under stress and set priorities such that efforts can be focused on areas that will benefit most from interventions. Cost savings are also realized if problems can be identified and remedied before serious damage occurs. For example, to be effective in human-wildlife conflict management, monitoring information should be used to influence land use decisions in a way that proactively mitigates future potential wildlife conflicts. In the City of London's Sifton Bog, a deer monitoring program was established only after the deer-resident conflict had reached a crisis level. This reactive measure has severely limited the number o f feasible deer management options (UTRCA, 2003). By contrast, results of on-going White-tailed deer monitoring in the City o f Waterloo RIM Park area have acted as an early warning system, having already been used to identify deer concentration areas, as well as to modify landscape planting species and locations (Waterloo, n.d.). In point of fact, the City o f Waterloo has been both nationally and internationally renowned for its watershed monitoring programs (Waterloo, n.d.). According to one respondent from the City of Waterloo, this success can be attributed to two main factors - (1) capacity for fieldwork that is supported by a strong economy, and (2) strong citizen support. Can these two factors be effectively encouraged in other municipalities to increase the amount o f terrestrial biomonitoring?

5.2.3

Biodiversity Science BMP: Community-Based Monitoring

One solution that has been proposed to help overcome municipal resource shortages for the collection o f biodiversity science and information is the concept of community-based monitoring (CBM). This is also being increasingly recognized by municipalities. For example, the City of Guelph State o f Sustainability Report (2003) included a recommendation that the City improve its performance on habitat protection through the development o f a protocol for community-based monitoring. More than just the support of volunteers, community-based monitoring is "a process where concerned citizens, government agencies, industry, academia, community groups and local institutions collaborate to monitor, track, and respond to issues of common community concern" (EMAN, 2003). For instance, the City o f Waterloo depends on cooperative partnerships with other agencies, universities and the development industry to carry out the Laurel Creek Watershed Monitoring Program (Waterloo, 2002). Other notable examples o f successful CBM programs include the Nature Watch Programs administered by the Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN) o f Environment Canada and the national bird count efforts supported by Bird Studies Canada (Whitelaw et al., 2003).'^ Each is a volunteer monitoring

EMAN monitoring initiatives include FrogWatch, PlantWatch and WormWatch. National programs supported by Bird Studies Canada include include FeederWatch, NestWatch and the Christmas Bird Count. These programs encourage individuals or groups to engage in monitoring of aspects of environmental quality and provide the resources (e.g. observation kits, instructions and training) to ensure that citizens submit meaningful results.

program that has demonstrated how citizen-science, with a bit o f expert guidance, can collect valuable data for decision-making. The results o f Bird Studies Canada surveys are now being utilized by various municipalities as indicators o f ecosystem health (Guelph, 2003b). Even at a local scale, the increasingly recognized benefits of community-based monitoring activities have resulted in an abundance o f smaller, less coordinated programs. One example o f this is the development and delivery of a Bio-blitz. A Bio-blitz is a community-based volunteer initiative with the objective o f surveying an area to identify and record as many species as possible, from as many taxonomic groups as possible, within a 24-hour period (CBI, 2001). As an initiative that links science, education and public participation, a Bio-blitz is best described as being part science, part publicity stunt (Johnson, 2003.06.28). However, in many areas these events also represent the first ever attempt to inventory local species. The involvement of both amateur and expert biodiversity specialists with members o f the general public helps to ensure the scientific integrity o f the data collected as a result of the blitz (CBI, 2001; Johnson, 2003.06.28). If conducted on an annual basis. Bio-blitzes can become the biodiversity benchmark against which ecosystem changes are measured. In Ontario, recent Bio-blitzes have not only attracted high-level media attention but have also contributed valuable information for future municipal planning decisions (CBI, 2001). Whitelaw et al. (2003) have developed the following list of CBM benefits to include, but not be limited to: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. extension o f government or academic monitoring networks; cost savings due to in-kind contributions o f volunteers; flexibility to carry out fieldwork during non-office hours; provision o f information for early (if uncertain) detection o f ecosystem changes that may merit further expert investigation or long-term monitoring; exposure o f people to the environment and development o f stewardship ethic; contributions to government planning through enhanced public participation; and potential to inform public debate, influence local government and promote adaptive management.

Most important to municipalities, CBM can be used to fill the gaps in existing government capacity to monitor ecosystems that have been left as the result o f cutbacks to environmental programs and activities (Whitelaw et al., 2003). However, volunteer monitoring programs should be carefully designed to complement, not replace existing programs for scientific monitoring. In 2003, EMAN published the results o f a pilot project aimed at determining the best approaches for engaging communities in monitoring activities that contribute to local sustainability. This pilot project resulted in the development o f a model to be used as a reference for other communities interested in starting up a CBM program. According to EMAN (2003), a successful CBM involves four key interrelated and cyclical phases: 1. Community Mapping - Gathering information about the community to understand the local context. This phase must answer questions related to local information needs, existing monitoring initiatives, community governance and community interest in monitoring. 48

Participation Assessment - Citizen engagement and understanding the groups and people involved in the CBM. This helps find the best approaches for building capacity by developing an understanding o f participants motivations, expectations, skills, expertise and training requirements. This stage will often include a community visioning process. Capacity Building - Enhancing the community's ability to cany out monitoring requires capacity in the form of resources and skills, both technical and social. This phase requires the development o f good coordination, training and information delivery mechanisms. Information Gathering & Delivery - Collection o f monitoring data and conversion of data into useful information for decision making. To be useful, data to be collected should be defined and driven by the needs o f the community. Effective communication mechanisms are required to ensure that information can be used to influence meaningful action.

Since all communities are unique, the above model must only be considered as a guide and applied in a manner appropriate to the local context (EMAN, 2003). Each community must also review best management practices in order to address particular problems or constraints that may jeopardize the success o f their CBM process. Such problems may include a loss of interest by volunteers, lack of participant objectivity, questionable accuracy o f data collection, and inconsistent funding that causes data fragmentation (Whitelaw et al., 2003). To attain meaningful results, it is critical that adequate funding and a commitment to the CBM process be secured prior to the initiation o f monitoring activities.

S.2.4 Additional Monitoring Initiatives and the Need fo r Integration
While watershed studies and subwatershed studies provide most o f the information currently used for planning, they leave considerable information gaps. A subwatershed study that looks only at areas scheduled for development may miss important biodiversity features within other natural areas. In addition, the broad scope and limited resources available for watershed studies or associated monitoring programs does not allow for a detailed examination o f every environmental aspect within the urban ecosystem. These information gaps are often filled by numerous smallscale, ad hoc studies. When asked what sources o f information on open spaces or wildlife are used for planning and operations, respondents from each of the selected municipalities listed on average 5 additional sources.'^ Examples o f additional monitoring or other studies that are common to most municipalities include: Environmental impact statements (EISs) prepared by the City or development industry; Ecological Land Classification (of vegetative communities); Inventories on ESAs included in the Official Plan or other Master Plans; Inventories o f City woodlots to be included in M aster Plans; Regional, landscape-level natural heritage studies or species databases; Provincial data on rare species fi-om the Natural Heritage Information Centre;

List of `additional' studies does not include the BNAl (see Section 5.2.5). Those municipalities that had completed a BNAI relied more heavily on this study for planning and operations than any other study.

Street tree or other public tree inventories; Informal studies o f areas scheduled for restoration or purchase by the City; and Consultant reports prepared for specific sites (e.g. Sifton Bog).

On an individual basis, each o f the above studies is useful in the sense that it contributes to the specific management need for which the original research was designed. In some cases, these management needs include human-wildlife conflict management. One notable example is the City of Mississauga's Credit Valley Wildlife Study (2001), designed to identify sigmficant wildlife issues in the Credit Valley. This study is unique among those conducted in the six selected municipalities as, in addition to identifying priority habitat and significant species, it sought to track common mammals and the conflicts tliat they create with people. As a collective, this information can also be a useful supplement for the purposes o f planning. For example, the Greenway Plan for the City o f Guelph was developed before the development of a detailed resource inventory or analysis of the existing corridors. Instead it stated that " [tjhis information is, or will become available in the numerous watershed and sub-watershed studies, r econdary plan studies and reports that have been or are in preparation" (Guelph, 1997). However, according to at least one respondent, the main challenge is integrating these many sources o f information to ensure that the public and decision-makers have sufficient access to make informed decisions. Research for this thesis found no central repository in any municipality for the information that was generated as a result o f these many studies, nor evidence o f a system to coordinate and track their progress. With information distributed among several departments and agencies, there is a risk that the data required for management decisions could easily be overlooked. There is also a risk o f project inefficiencies, such as a duplication of effort or missed opportunities for partnerships.
5 .2 .5

Biodiversity & Natural Area Inventories

In North America, municipalities have begun to respond to the need for more highly integrated biodiversity data by developing Biodiversity and Natural Areas Inventories (BNAI). Many municipalities consider Biodiversity and Natural Areas Inventories as another form o f monitoring (Waterloo, 2002). However, BNAI differ from other monitoring programs in that they are not part of a continuous assessment process. As outlined in Table 9, these studies are typically used to create a one-time, detailed database o f facts about the location, size, shape, quantity and quality o f natural features, uses and health of natural areas within a municipality. This comprehensive information creates a baseline that assists the municipality in responsible planning; assessing the relative environmental significance o f natural areas to set priorities for management, predicting the impacts o f land use decisions, and setting targets for future conservation and/or use (Ottawa, 1999; Mississauga, 2000; Dwyer et al., 2002). The importance of Biodiversity and Natural Areas Inventories has been well recognized by experts as a critical step towards the best management o f municipal biodiversity resources. It is now recommended that, at a minimum, each municipality conduct a BNAI to identify existing natural and open spaces, regardless of ownership, and to inventoiy the resources o f which they 50

are comprised (Andrews and Cranmer-Byng, 1981 ; Platt et al., 1994; Inoguchi, 1999; Savard et al., 2000; WHC, 2001). This recommendation has also been recognized by several Canadian municipalities, including many o f those in southern Ontario. Four o f the six selected municipalities have either completed or are in the process o f completing such initiatives (see Table 7).`'' The City o f Guelph Environmental Action Plan (2003b) placed a particular importance on the need to address gaps in resource inventories, making data collection for an inventory o f selected natural features and the development o f a strategy for routine data collection among its first priority environmental actions. This recommendation is also reflected in other City o f Guelph planning documents, such as the City o f Guelph State o f Sustainability Report (2003) and the Official Plan (1995). The Official Plan (1997) for the City o f Burlington also includes a commitment to periodically prepare and update an inventory o f significant natural areas within the urban planning area. While the City o f Waterloo Environmental Strategic Plan (2002) recommended that an inventory o f the size and health o f municipal greenspaces be prepared, there is no evidence that this sort o f initiative is yet taking place. Why should a Biodiversity and Natural Areas Inventory be so important to these municipalities? According to one respondent from the City o f Guelph, a BNAI is urgently needed as municipal planners in Guelph currently do not have the knowledge that is required to effectively implement the recommendations that have been made in the watershed studies. Natural areas have not been ranked according to priorities for protection, restoration and management because the City does not know for certain what natural features they contain. A large amount o f the information contained in subwatershed studies has been researched by consultants for the development industry, but little of this has yet been verified by the municipality. As such, the municipality is lacking a crucial base o f knowledge that is needed to support or challenge data presented by developers in environmental impact statements (EIS). The City of Guelph is thus concerned that, due to factual or technical errors in EIS, urban natural features are in decline. This situation is likely to be reflected in other municipalities that have yet to conduct a BNAI. Similarly, respondents from municipalities that have completed a BNAI spoke to its multiple benefits for both the agencies responsible and the community. In the City o f Hamilton, a computer model is now being developed based on information generated during the BNAI to assess and predict the impact of land use changes within the municipality. This is one o f many otherwise impossible planning initiatives that has been made practicable by a BNAI. Overall, municipal experience has shown how a BNAI can be used to: Provide information to decision makers, developers and the public; Monitor the status o f species, with particular emphasis on rare species;
'`*The City of Guelph is not included in Table 7 as Guelph had not yet begun its inventory study. In Februaty 2004, Phase I of the study was in progress. This included background research, identification o f areas for field work, contact with landowners, and a public process to define the concept of `local significance'. Phase II inventory fieldwork - was expected to officially begin in the Summer o f 2004. Phase III - development of an integrated municipal stewardship program - will be completed at the end of the study. In February 2004, project budget was limited ($60,000 - $90,000) but is expected to be enhanced by external partnership funding.

Monitor the status o f plant communities, with particular emphasis on rare communities; Identify and heighten awareness o f Environmentally Significant Areas (ESAs) and other natural areas; Provide inform ation to rank priorities for conservation or restoration o f natural areas; Generate a municipal base o f data that can be used to verify, support or challenge data presented by developers in environmental impact statements; and Collect baseline data such that it is possible to monitor the impact o f land use change and to develop models to more accurately predict future impacts.

As discussed in Section 5.2.4, some information is already available for significant natural areas (e.g. ESAs, wetlands, woodlots, etc.) that have been previously studied for provincial and/or municipal conservation designations. The success o f BNAI is dependent in part on the extent to which they build upon these previous studies, effectively integrating existing data and generating new data. However, while these tend to focus on public land resources, there is also a need to know what exists in municipality as a whole - both public and private land.

Each o f the studies presented in Table 9 is an example o f a successful BNAI. The City of Hamilton and City o f M ississauga have both tested their methodology and, following a few minor adjustments, have now completed a second update to the original study. The BNAI completed by the City o f Hamilton has become a key planning document for both the Planning Department in the City o f Hamilton and the Hamilton Region Conservation Authority.'^ Capitalizing on the experience o f other municipalities, the BNAI for the Halton Region (including Burlington) is now being modeled after the Hamilton inventory study. These two projects even share the same project coordinator. This sharing o f successes and lessons learned among municipalities can create significant savings in terms o f both time and resources, particularly as it contributes to good study design and helps to overcome common constraints. Similar to monitoring, cost can be one o f the main impediments to the completion o f a BNAI. As seen in Table 9, a well-managed BNAI can be expected to cost upwards o f $500,000. However, municipal experiences have shown how human and financial resource availability can be easily expanded by the development o f partnerships. W hile the Hamilton Conservation Authority provided for the day-to-day management o f the inventory, the Hamilton Naturalists' Club maintained the role o f overall project manager because its "charitable non-profit status meant that funds unavailable to government agencies could be obtained" (Dwyer et al., 2002). As demonstrated by the experience o f the City o f Ottawa, there is also a strong role for community-based monitoring in the development o f a biodiversity or a natural areas inventory. The City o f Ottawa is currently in the process o f completing a Urban Natural Areas Environmental Evaluation Study (UNAEES). This BNAI study is designed to gather factual information about spaces with measurable natural values within the urban planning area. For the purposes o f the UNAEES, residents were considered a valuable source o f information on the characteristics, value and use o f natural spaces within the connnunity (Ottawa, 2003a). As such, during the planning phase for the study, members o f the public were consulted to (a) provide information on the ecology and use o f sites selected for study, and (b) suggest additional candidate sites for study based on their knowledge o f spaces in the local community (Ottawa, 2003b). Community input resulted in eight new study sites being added to the study, as well as the further expansion o f the study area o f six existing sites (Ottawa, 2004). Ecological and land use information collected during the field work phase is now being used to rank Ottawa's natural areas and prioritize courses o f action for management, protection and naturalization. Another major obstacle to the completion o f a BNAI is landowner consent. As seen in Table 9, an accurate image o f urban biodiversity depends on an assessment o f the resources o f both public and private lands. However, as the inventory is being conducted in an urban area, the majority of land within the study area is privately owned. While permission to conduct non-invasive investigations on private property can be assumed (e.g. as it was in Hamilton's 1991 NAI), methods that seek explicit permission are considered to be more desirable. Permission to access a

'^Despite being well developed, there is some suggestion that the Hamilton BNAI may not be in wide use as a tool across other departments in the City. Interviews with staff from the City o f Hamilton Parks Department revealed no knowledge or use o f the BNAI in operations.

property not only demonstrates respect for the rights o f the property owners but also raises their awareness to issues o f local biodiversity. In the experience o f municipalities, depending on the method of contact, landowner consent can be as low as 15%.'^ Slightly higher participation rates are realized when landowners are contacted in person, but this can be very time consuming (Dwyer et al., 2002). Though its integration may be a costly addition to the BNAI studies, the final study characteristic to highlight from Table 9 - the integration o f data obtained into a spatial database - is not a study constraint, but an example o f the value-added by such inventories. This recommended step is common to all effective BNAI as it provides several distinct advantages for urban planners (Platt et al., 1994; WHC, 2001). First, it allows the municipality to integrate and store all data from the BNAI with historical data from other studies in one centralized computer program. This helps to ensure that decisions taken are based on a complete set of the best possible information. Second, it allows the municipality to digitally map and visually present and analyse the study findings. To date, Biodiversity and Natural Areas Inventories do not include special considerations for nuisance species. However, Section 7.3 outlines how such spatially referenced information may be useful for human-wildlife conflict management in the future.

This Section has demonstrated the wide range o f environmental studies being undertaken by each o f the six selected municipalities. However, the question remains - if there is so much data available, why is improved scientific information on urban biodiversity still necessary? The first major challenge now faced by municipalities relates to the data that are collected. This analysis supports the results o f other studies which have found that, " [rjeporting on the quantity and quality o f urban habitats is rarely done" (WHC, 2001). While the selected municipalities have mapped the more dominant natural areas and characterized broad vegetation types, they have spent less time evaluating their value as quality habitat or identifying the species therein. While the BNAI are a step in the right direction, the scope o f these studies is frequently still isolated to ESAs. The information on species that would be required to implement spatially referenced solutions to human-wildlife conflicts (see Section 7.3) is still largely lacking. Studies that explore other areas o f knowledge deficiency (e.g. the epidemiological risks associated with nuisance species as a vector for disease) are also still in need o f development. The second major challenge is the relative utility o f the data that are collected. Municipalities do not just need to deliver environmental information, but they also need to increase community capacity to understand and use that information (EMAN, 2003). To be effective in humanwildlife conflict management, monitoring information should be used to influence land use decisions in a way that proactively mitigates future potential wildlife conflicts. To accomplish this, it is recommended that municipalities undertake a study that specifically relates to wildlife

However, it should be noted that the low consent rate is linked more to a lack o f landowner response than aversion to the BNAI study (Dwyer et al., 2002).

issues is the urban area. This could be something similar to or even more in depth than the City o f M ississauga's Credit Valley Wildlife Study (2001). However, in order for such a study to be effective, it must first ask the right questions. Therefore, this may also require more front-end research into the socioeconomic aspects o f human-wildlife conflicts. The question o f access to information has also not yet been fully addressed. The public and other non-govemment stakeholders were found to have relatively open access to the results o f the watershed studies, subwatershed studies and BNAI. The results are available for purchase in some municipalities (to assist in covering the cost o f the research) while others provide them free o f charge. Only sensitive data, such as the location o f rare species, may be withheld. However, the real challenge is finding it. In many cases, the information that wildlife managers, open space planners and the public need to make decisions simply does not exist. However, where the data do exist, it is clear that the many sources must be integrated to ensure that the public and decision-makers have sufficient access to make informed decisions. Therefore, it is recommended that municipalities and their related Conserv ation Authorities work in partnership with other agencies to complete both a BNAI and a more detailed wildlife study. In doing so, municipalities should not only review the best management practices o f other urban areas, but should also look for areas where data, expertise, resources or even staff can be shared to increase opportunities for project efficiencies. Finally, it is also recommended that municipalities increase their capacity for gathering data on urban biodiversity by implementing protocols for community-based monitoring. A review of the pilot-tested model for CBM developed by EMAN is a good first step in this direction.'^

PLAIW ING FOR NATURALIZATION AND C O M LICT M ITIGATION

Based on testimony provided during interviews and municipal documentation, this section will explore the development o f naturalization projects in the six selected municipalities, what initiatives are currently taking place, how they are planned and implemented, and if these processes take into consideration community concerns for nuisance species. This section will also outline some o f the best management practices that have been proposed to help reduce the frequency and/or severity o f human-wildlife conflicts that might result from naturalization and urban development. 6.1

The ability for a given area to support any species is dependent on the availability o f food and shelter (Belant, 1997). As a result, a wildlife population will generally increase in response to habitat protection measures that enhance the abundance o f such resources (Messmer, 2000). In urban centres, this is often accomplished by closing areas to developrr. 'nt to protect species and habitats or by reversing previous development impacts on habitat via naturalization. However, problems arise as these protection measures are undertaken "often without regard to the activity ranges o f the animals to be protected or to in-holdings, where land use patterns conflict with the surrounding area" (Fall and Jackson, 2002). Such is the case with protected open spaces surrounding residential areas or urban airports, where public perceptions o f lethal measures or concerns for public safety mean wildlife cannot be managed using traditional methods. Naturalization has been defined as both an experimental science and an urban project, where each step must be subject to monitoring, review and debate (Middleton, 1994; Alario, 2000). However, while a great deal o f research has been directed towards determining the ideal `environmental aesthetic' for urban restoration projects, there has been less focus on research for the purpose o f monitoring human-wildlife interactions (Johnson, 1995 ; Parsons, 1995; Schauman and Salisbury, 1998; Gobster, 2001). In addition to applicable science, Schauman and Salisbury (1998) demonstrate how the "restoration o f urban green areas requires two complementary efforts, (1) a plan or process to locate and rank potential restoration sites and (2) an understanding o f how restoration designs will be accepted, and tlierefore, maintained by nearby residents" . As will be discussed in the following sections, the capacity o f municipalities in southern Ontario to realize these efforts is currently in need o f significant improvement.

Naturalization is often seen as an evolution o f the urban process. M any urbanized areas have now reached a level of development where highly valued natural areas have become scarce. Residents in many municipalities have shown support for an increase in the amount and quality o f environment-oriented urban land. For example, a public survey associated with the City o f Hamilton Parks, Culture and Recreation Master Plan (2002) found that approximately 36% of residents surveyed support new and improved natural open spaces. As a result, municipalities are now acquiring open spaces and, where possible, maintaining and enhancing natural form (Schauman and Salisbury, 1998). As noted in Section 3.1, starting in the 1980s, a number o f municipalities in southern Ontario began to retrofit urbanized areas to include natural components through the process o f naturalization (Ingram et al., 2001). This is true o f each o f the six municipalities selected for study, each o f which has made significant progress in this area. For example, the City o f Mississauga's naturalization program now includes more than 200 sites and over 303 ha o f public land (Mississauga, 2002). In addition, each o f the six selected municipalities continue to relatively aggressively pursue additional environmental land acquisition and rehabilitation projects (Mississauga, 2002; Waterloo, 2002; Guelph, 2003a; HCA, 2003). As a result, a continuing challenge for these municipalities is to determine how to best integrate the degraded and/or unused open space resources o f the city into the land use system in order to maximize diversity (Platt et al., 1994). During research, only three o f the selected municipalities London, Guelph and Mississauga - could present evidence o f having developed a coordinated municipal policy or program that could be used to guide naturalization.'® However, a formal naturalization policy is not a prerequisite for the generation o f naturalization initiatives within the urban area. The City o f Waterloo is a prime example o f how a more diffuse naturalization program, with numerous small changes in policy and practice, can aggregate over time to result in significant landscape modifications. Table 10 outlines some o f the major naturalization-related initiatives that have been introduced in the City o f Waterloo since the late 1970's.

I )

'®While the City o f Waterloo's Environmental Lands Acquisition and Maintenance Strategy (1999) can be considered a naturalization policy, it is limited in scope. As a result, it has not been counted as such for the purposes o f this analysis. As o f the May 2004, a naturalization policy for the City o f Burlington had been proposed but not yet approved.

While their implementation has been diffuse, the results o f the various naturalization programs outlined in Table 10 have been significant. Since 1989, 161.53 ha o f park and open space has been designated as `no-mow' creek buffer area (Waterloo, 2003). As o f 1990, all new subdivisions have had an "appropriate" number o f trees planted - the equivalent of approximately 1400 new trees per year (Waterloo, 2003). In 1999, more than 46% o f the 688 ha o f woodlands in the City o f Waterloo were under public ownership for protection and ecological management (Waterloo, 1999). By the year 2000, over 40 km o f W aterloo's 91 km o f total creek length had been naturalized or rehabilitated to some extent (Waterloo, 2003). According to one respondent from the City o f Guelph, these municipal achievements do not even begin to compare to what has been accomplished by the non-govemment community. Two volunteer naturalization initiatives have virtually changed the landscape o f Guelph - (1) Trees for Guelph, a massive tree planting initiative on unused open lands, and (2) an Ontario Public Interest Research Group (OPERG) managed initiative to transplant mature trees from areas to be

developed to natural areas in need.'^ Though frequently smaller in scale, similar volunteer-led naturalization initiatives can also be found in each o f the five other selected municipalities (see Section 6.4). Volunteer participation is attractive to municipalities and Conservation Authorities that undertake naturalization projects as it not only helps to secure the success o f projects through the development of a sense o f public ownership, but also helps to expand limited financial and human resources. The initial costs associated with a naturalization project may be high. According to one respondent from the Parks Department in the City o f Mississauga, average annual costs of their city-wide naturalization program can be broken out as follows: (Average) Budget $50,000 $50,000 + $25.000 $125,000/year Expense - plant materials and supplies - partnerships with the Conservation Authority - community coordination and school initiatives Total (+ in-kind and corporate support)

Similarly, the current purchase price for environmental lands in the City o f Waterloo is estimated at $2,650 per acre (Waterloo, 1999). Assuming that the Capital Budget program provides for the purchase o f 30 to 40 acres o f environmental lands per year, the City o f Waterloo estimates the additional maintenance/management costs o f their acquisitions to be in the range o f $2100-$2900 annually (Waterloo, 1999). However, once established, the low level o f maintenance that is generally required to sustain a naturalized area can result in significant cost savings when compared to the alternative o f continuing conventional horticultural practices (Guelph, 1993). This assumes that the projects are successful.

Given the commitment o f resources, municipalities and other organizations involved in naturalization should look for means to ensure a positive return on investment. Though not required, formal naturalization policies and programs do benefit the municipality by providing direction in decision-making. Without this, decisions for naturalization projects are taken on a very opportunistic basis. According to respondents, municipal experiences have shown how opportunistic naturalization projects that are taken as a result o f political will or visibility are more likely to fail than those that are well planned. This theory is also supported by several authors (Schauman and Salisbury, 1998; Pedroli et al., 2002). Pedroli et al. (2002) emphasize that a relatively high level o f impact assessment is required to ensure the success of restoration projects. Such assessments help to determine not only viable areas for naturalization, but also the goals, actions, resource requirements and possible constraints

on a project. Next to resource availability, other major constraints might include other societal demands on the natural area and a lack o f community support. Despite the importance o f this step, only three o f the six selected municipalities have developed some type o f prioritization criteria for their naturalization projects - Mississauga, Waterloo, and London (see Table 11). These criteria are often associated with formal naturalization policies or programs, if limited in scope.

Description of Prioritization Methodology/Criteria
The City o f Hamilton does not yet have a formal system or formal criteria for the prioritization of naturalization projects. Projects are currently undertaken based on opportunity for landowner or volunteer cooperation. However, the City is working on setting up targets for the amount o f natural cover to be achieved within the municipality. Based on a landscapelevel analysis of existing natural areas, priorities for naturalization will then be set per habitat type. The Hamilton Conservation Authority currently uses needs identified in the Nature Counts! (2002) BNAI as the primary criteria for the selection of naturalization sites. Other criteria include land ownership, funding, effort required and support from the CA superintendent with responsibility for a particular area. These projects are highly opportunistic, looking to maximize the amount of natural restoration that can be accomplished given resources for a particular year (i.e. the biggest "bang-for-buck"). The Naturalization in the City o f Guelph Parks Policy (1993) does not include criteria for prioritization of sites. Extension of Policy to nearly all existing and new City parks is based on success o f 10 pilot projects. With review of watershed studies, decisions for naturalization are taken by the Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA) on an opportunistic basis. Projects with high visibility or political support tend to receive priority. City-managed naturalization projects are currently decided on an ad hoc basis by the Naturalization Sub-Committee of the Environmental Management Team (cross-departmental). However, the Sub-Committee is working towards development of an overall naturalization plan. Current efforts include a city-wide inventory o f existing initiatives and their participants. Physical and biological parameters as assessed in watershed studies form the initial basis for naturalization projects managed by the Conservation Authority. However, given the areas of greatest need, projects are undertaken on an opportunistic basis where the biggest "bang-for-buck" and landowner cooperation can be achieved. Beginning with a review of maintenance needs, the City of Mississauga tries to implement at least one naturalization project on each o f its watersheds every year. Projects only take priority if they are politically driven or voluntarily adopted by an interest group. Data for site selection is from the Natural Areas Survey (2000) BNAI and its updates. Naturalization projects of the Conservation Authority are based on the "ABC" approach - an evaluation of abiotic, biotic and community factors. Data for the evaluation is derived from studies conducted by the CA or the NAS (2000) BNAI. These criteria are essentially used to narrow the scope o f a project down from the watershed, to the river, river segment and finally the project site. Habitat type and the biggest "bang-for-buck" are also considered here. Additional criteria are set out in its Credit Valley Conservation Stewardship Strategy (2000) for the prioritization of `Stewardship' projects (often restoration). In evaluating criteria for a particular project, an importance of high, medium or low is assigned to project elements that will contribute to specific environmental, social or economic benefits, and projects are ranked accordingly. Project implementation feasibility is also considered as part of this assessment.

Description of Prioritization Methodology/Criteria
Under the Environmental Lands Acquisition and Maintenance Strategy (1999), the acquisition of each site is considered on the basis of: size, social importance, natural heritage features, uniqueness, ecological functions, availability (for acquisition), development pressures, and open space linkage opportunity. For each site, criteria are ranked on a scale of 1-3 and the scored to determine their rating as being either high, medium or low priority. On other naturalization projects, the Laurel Creek Watershed Siutfy (\993) forms the basis of information used to set priorities. Prioritization based primarily on a gcu copine assessment of water courses; this assessment was used to decide suitable sites for naturalization over 10-year period (starting in 2002). Other factors considered include political will, visibility, safety and available funding. Projects motivated primarily by political will tend to have lower success rate as the site location and/or design features selected may not be viable. The City o f London uses the Natural Features Restoration Program Evaluation and Implementation Manual (Flege! and Jacob, 1996) to prioritize projects for naturalization in terms o f feasibility and benefits. For evaluation, sites are first classified as either (A) natural space in need of enhancement, (B) unused open space in need of restoration, (C) sites which contain natural features but are not in need of naturalization, or (D) sites that have no natural features and no space available for naturalization. Only Category A and B sites are evaluated with the Natural Features Restoration Criteria. Each criterion is weighted equally with a maximum score of 6. The sites are then ranked and rated based on their final score - sites with the highest score in their classification become the highest priority. TJie criteria are; Social Criteria - Proximity to Schools; Volunteer Stewardship; Visibility/Aesthetics; Proximity to Privately Owned Space; Potential for Damage (to site) Ecological Criteria - Association with Natural Corridors; Biological Communities in Existing Natural Area(s); Physical Features and Problems (per project type); Size and Shape of Site; Suitability for Planting; Proximity to Water for Wildlife; Proximity to Buildings; Proximity to Other Woodlots Economic Criteria - Maintenance Concerns or Problems; Long Term Maintenance Savings; Project Costs; Short Term Maintenance Costs A complete site evaluation requires a site inspection, reference to previous studies, and a consultation with City staff. Evaluation does not include a biological inventory of the area - considered to have been completed under previous studies. While the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) works closely for naturalization with the City, projects are also undertaken independently. Prioritization decisions of the UTRCA are based on research conducted for subwatershed `report cards' using the "ABC" approach - an evaluation of abiotic, biotic and community factors (combined with mapping). Projects may be opportunistic depending on resources or land owner and volunteer interest.

As can be seen from Table 11, while only implemented by three municipalities, the need for naturalization criteria has been recognized by all six selected municipalities. The City o f Burlington currently has a committee working towards the development o f an overall naturalization plan. Similarly, the City o f Hamilton is working on setting targets for natural habitat cover that will be mapped against information from the Nature Counts! (2002) BNAI to determine priorities for naturalization. In addition, as the City o f Guelph's Naturalization in the City o f Guelph Parks Policy (1993) has now expired, commitments were made in the City's most recent Environmental Action Plan (2003b) to update the strategy, as well as other naturalization policies and programs in place throughout the City. From Table 11, it can also be seen that there are several similarities among those municipalities that have developed and applied naturalization criteria. One common theme is the consideration o f not only ecological, but also social and economic factors. This is because selecting restoration sites based on community support is often as critical to the success o f naturalization projects as is the ability to map and measure biological and physical parameters (Schauman and Salisbury, 1998; Hands and Brown, 2002). The City o f London learned the importance o f this balance in criteria through municipal experiences. Many o f the City o f London's early naturalization projects failed due to a lack of public consultation. In its worst case scenario, a natural retrofit that was undertaken in the Gainsborough Park area without a community engagement process resulted in so much resistance and negative community feedback tl'at land managers were forced to change the design. Approximately three years of discussions with residents were required in order to reach an agreement on how to `retrofit the retrofit', resulting in a considerable expenditure o f resources. As a result, the City has fundamentally changed the way in which it plans for naturalization (see Section 6.5.1). In addition, the selection and prioritization criteria for naturalization projects in the City of London are now the most stringent o f any o f the municipalities examined. According to respondents, concerns for safety and a dislike of (transition stage) aesthetics are now the two most common community complaints associated with naturalization projects. In some cases, community support for naturalization was also found to falter following the introduction of particular nuisance species; primarily deer, coyotes, fox, predatory birds or waterfowl, mice and other rodents, snakes, and `weeds'. However, research found that none of the six selected municipalities consider the potential influx of nuisances as a possible criteria when planning naturalization projects. 6.4
C o m m u n ity I n v o l v e m e n t in N a t u r a l i z a t i o n

In practice, naturalization has been met with a mixed reaction from residential communities (Arquilla, 1994; Schauman and Salisbury, 1998; Alario, 2000; Gobster, 2001). Community concerns include aesthetics, safety, lack o f certainty about project benefits, lost opportunities for alternate land uses, decreased property value on adjacent lands, health problems (e.g. allergies) and floral and faunal pest infestation. As a municipality's most important decision-making factor should be the concerns o f the community, these issues must be addressed.

As seen in Table 11, naturalization sites are often ranked according to degree o f public interest.^® Broad-based citizen involvement in planning and implementation is critical to the naturalization process as it empowers stakeholders and helps ensure that the restored landscape will be maintained over the long-term (Gobster, 2001). Having recognized this, there are many ways by which municipalities seek to involve the community in naturalization. Developed based on the testimony o f respondents. Table 12 outlines how the community is involved in naturalization projects for the six selected municipalities at each phase of project development.

M ost respondents agreed that naturalization projects should be initiated with some form of education for the local community. Arquilla (1994) outlines the broad range o f media that can be used for this purpose. Similar to other public education efforts, methods include signage, letters to community residents, letters to City council, information pamphlets or brochures, public discussion meetings/presentations, contact with local advocacy groups, and publication/release o f planned maintenance prescriptions. As outlined in Table 12, four o f the six selected municipalities regularly conduct an open house and/or public input meeting during the planning o f naturalization projects. These are considered to be opportunities for residents to leam about proposed plans for the landscape and to suggest changes based on community concerns. However, a small number o f respondents criticized this open house process as being little more than a public relations tool, stating that the public meetings do not attract a wide enough audience to be representative o f the community. In addition, it was suggested that the comments from residents that do attend the meetings rarely have an impact on changing the design of projects. Public safety and the perception of project aesthetics are the most commonly discussed issues of concern during public forums. There is little evidence from the testimony o f respondents or municipal documentation that issues related to nuisance wildlife are frequently raised, either by residents or by project planning staff. However, while enhanced biodiversity is viewed as an ecological benefit o f naturalization and is a measure o f project success, respondents from each of the six selected municipalities also recognized that the potential establishment of nuisance species should be an important project consideration. The reason that this is not raised at public meetings is unknown, but was suggested by one respondent as one o f the many concerns that can be overlooked when contact between planning staff and residents is limited. While initial public interest in a project that is adjacent to a residential area may be high, municipal experience has found that community interest and involvement in naturalization tends to decrease as it moves through the various phases o f project development. The high interest in the on-ground implementation o f naturalization projects that is demonstrated by volunteer groups is generally not shared by the community as a whole. W ithout the ongoing interest o f volunteers, most municipalities cannot afford to provide for the long-term monitoring or maintenance o f naturalization projects. As a result, the success o f naturalization projects is generally not tracked past the implementation phase (typically the first 2 - 1 0 years). As a result, municipal staff may remain unaware o f any negative ecological or social impacts generated as a result o f a particular naturalization project until the problem has reached crisis levels. Respondents were able to cite several instances where naturalization projects have later resulted in community complaints regarding wildlife nuisances. For example, while considered an ecological success, concerned residents o f the City o f Mississauga objected to the presence o f coyotes which appeared around Lake Aquitaine following its naturalization. This situation was eventually diffused through the provision o f public education.

Public education is ju st one o f several best management practices (BMP) proposed by respondents to help municipalities reduce the frequency and/or severity o f human-wildlife conflicts experienced as a result o f naturalization or residential development. All o f the following BMP are proposed as proactive solutions, though many may be implemented as a reaction to an existing problem.

6.5.1

Undertake a Strong Community Environmental Planning Approach

Respondents from two o f the six selected municipalities suggested that the best way to manage urban wildlife is to undertake a strong community environmental planning approach. This could mean (1) planning natural areas such that wildlife is no longer attracted to the urban matrix and/or (2) planning naturalization projects in order to mitigate their impact on adjacent residential areas. Both approaches demonstrate proactive problem solving on the part o f the municipality. As outlined by Middleton (1994), " [a] key to understanding biodiversity in cities is to consider them at a landscape scale, as a mosaic o f different types o f habitats". The configuration o f this mosaic is thought to be o f critical importance. For example, as urban areas expand, remnant natural habitats become increasingly fragmented and isolated, as do the floral and faimal species therein. As a consequence, if an isolated species wants to expand its range it has no option but to pass through the relatively inhospitable urban core. This brings the species into potential conflict with humans (see Design A, Figure 6). Figure 6: Comparison of Urban Configurations for Wildlife Migration

Studies have shown that the frequency o f wildlife damage complaints varies among geographic areas and have suggested that this variation is related to local habitat conditions being either favourable or unfavourable for individual species (Hadidian, 1991). As an alternative, an urban configuration that maintains large patches o f natural area and ample linkages between habitat patches provides opportunities for wildlife to migrate within the city without being forced to enter the urban core (see Design B, Figure 6). As outlined in one study, Guelph is seen to have an amount o f public, nature-oriented open space that is above the norm for a mid-sized city (Guelph, 1997). The study also applauded the linked nature o f a good deal o f this public open space network. According to respondents from the Parks and Planning Departments in the City o f Guelph, it is by maintaining this urban configuration that the City has been able to avoid most o f the common problems associated with urban nuisance wildlife.^' However, while the natural preference for more hospitable natural areas and wildlife corridors may keep timid species (e.g. coyotes and fox) from entering the urban core, the same may not necessarily be said o f other opportunistic species such as raccoons and rodents that are now well adapted to the urban environment in most areas. If a free meal is available, they will find it. In addition, it has been found that the more that biologically rich areas o f a city are connected to each other and to larger expanses o f wild habitat, the more species are likely to survive and thrive (Middleton, 1994). The more species that survive and thrive, the greater the potential for human-wildlife interaction and/or conflict (O 'Donnell and VanDruff, 1983). This is why it is important that even cities with urban configurations that are sensitive to the ecological needs of wildlife continue to plan naturalization projects such as to mitigate their potential impact on adjacent residential areas. There are many ways in which this can be accomplished. First and foremost, naturalization projects should be planned with consultation and participation o f the community. Taking this one step further, the City o f London has now directly integrated community concerns into its selection criteria for naturalization projects. The priority for a naturalization project is now automatically decreased if there are residential lots within 100 metres o f a proposed site (Flegel and Jacob, 1996). In addition, when naturalization must take place in proximity to developments, the City of London now tries to buffer projects by restricting its retrofit activity to the side o f the open space that is the furthest from residential properties. These practices are said to be in place to take into consideration possible property owner objections to natural landscaping techniques and the potential for damage to the natural area due to encroachment or vandalism.

Enhance Technical Considerations fo r Wildlife During Naturalization

In addition to strong environmental planning in the community, specific sites selected for naturalization m ust also be planned for the proactive mitigation of potential human-wildlife conflicts. As outlined by Belant (1997), the architectural design o f existing or new facilities and

the characteristics o f adjacent habitat should be considered during the planning stages where nuisance species are likely. This type o f planning requires that the municipality have some prior knowledge o f the species that are present in the natural area, the species that are likely to (re)colonize the area following naturalization, and the species which surrounding residents may find undesirable. Regardless of nuisance species presence, it is still recommended that a pre-naturalization inventory o f all natural areas be conducted (1) to determine the suitability o f the site for restoration, and (2) to set targets for focal species in the habitat and adjust landscape design accordingly (Pedroli et al., 2002). For example, the determination o f coyotes as a desired focal species for Toronto's Tommy Thompson Park has led naturalization managers to include constructed den sites in the project design (TRCA, 2000). Similarly, assuming that potential nuisance species can be identified, naturalization planners can design projects given the active controls that will be required for each specific site. For example, while constructed coyote dens may be appropriate for a relatively remote urban park, they may not be so for a natural area directly adjacent to a residential development. Controls can be designed to either deter or accommodate for species colonization and can include a wide variety o f habitat management techniques and exclusionary devices. To some extent, respondents from all o f the six selected municipalities stated that they understood the importance of this type o f mitigative landscape design. Most municipalities in southern Ontario have now modified the landscape in at least one site to deter the overabundance of nuisance geese. In addition, it is now common practice for a municipality to discourage the creation o f wet components (i.e. mosquito habitat) during natural stormwater management system design. However, only the City o f Mississauga demonstrated evidence that nuisances are regularly considered when planning for naturalization. While the City o f London has attempted to create buffers between residents and naturalization projects, this is not done for the specific purpose o f discouraging nuisance species. By contrast, the use o f mowed buffers by the Parks Department in the City o f Mississauga was explained as an active attempt to reduce the backyard migration o f species and increase resident comfort level faced with naturalization. During riparian naturalization projects, the City has also been proactive in the construction o f extra large culverts designed to accommodate beavers without having their dams become a flooding nuisance. Unfortunately, though a regular consideration during naturalization, nuisance species potentials are still not mandatory planning criteria for the City o f Mississauga. This means that the City's mitigative nuisance design protocols are implemented on an ad hoc basis, and are often limited to major nuisances; e.g. deer, beavers, waterfowl, and mosquitoes. Staff o f the City o f Mississauga Animal Services Department with a responsibility for monitoring residential nuisance complaints have never been contacted to provide input on proposed projects. In all municipalities, this ad hoc implementation o f mitigative nuisance measures during naturalization can undermine tire effectiveness o f any mitigative protocols that are in place.

been shown that, " [ajlthough control activities can be effective at the site where the [nuisance] problem occurs, uncoordinated management efforts may cause relocation o f the problems to surrounding areas" (Belant, 1997). Therefore, it is recommended that an integrated, landscapelevel management approach be implemented to ensure an overall reduction in the conflict between wildlife and people in urban environments (Bhat et al., 1996; Belant, 1997). This will be further discussed in Section 7.3.

6.5.3

Enhance Technical Considerations fo r Wildlife During Development

W ith respect to the way that urban development proceeds in a city, municipalities have recognized that there is now a need to enhance technical considerations for the environment in planning and urban design (Kanter, 1990; Waterloo, 2002). This means that methods need to be established to not only balance development with the natural environment, but also to accommodate growth in such a way that negative impacts on both the environment and the community are minimized. In the case o f human-wildlife conflicts, revised technical considerations could include the implementation o f construction guidelines that require developers to integrate natural area connections into new subdivision design (see Section 6.5.1). Through various policy documents and strategic decisions, all o f the six selected municipalities now have measures in place to connect natural areas via the development o f greenways and other wildlife migration corridors. As was seen in the example o f the naturalization initiatives of the City o f W aterloo (Table 10), it is now common that a municipality require new developments to meet a mandatory designation of park or open space; typically 5% per land to be developed (Guelph, 1997). Taking this one step further, studies such as Options fo r a Greater Toronto Area Greenlands Strategy (Kanter, 1990) and the City of Guelph State o f Sustainability Report (2003) have recommended that urban municipalities also require developers to link the open space between built up areas. Policies such as these could help to mitigate nuisances by creating more hospitable paths among natural areas. One respondent also recommended that teclinical considerations for the mitigation o f humanwildlife conflicts be applied to the development of new housing guidelines and/or changes to building codes that would force developers to take a universal approach to common nuisance problems at the time o f construction. The following list of simple, low-cost preventative measures is derived from advice provided by the City o f Mississauga (n.d.) and the Canadian Federation o f Humane Societies (2004). To be effective, these measures should be applied to all new houses, garages and other associated outbuildings. Chimneys should be capped with a 16 gauge steel cap; All exterior vents (roof, bathroom, kitchen, and dryer) should be screened from the inside with a 16 gauge steel mesh beyond the vent hole; Window wells should be screened with a 16 gauge steel mesh or screened with plexiglass; Any soffit should be secured with screws and any gaps between soffit and roof should be screened with 16 gauge mesh; Decks o f 3' and higher should be completely open around the bottom (i.e. no lattice); Decks o f 3' and lower need to be properly screened to prevent wildlife invasions; Tree should be trimmed at least 15 feet back from the house; 71

· » · ·

Heavy vines and trellis' on the home should be avoided; Access to ornamental exterior architecture can be prevented by covering with netting; Proper sealing should be used around pipes and other openings; M otion-sensor activated exterior lighting should be installed to deter nocturnal species.

The relative simplicity and low-cost o f such measures means that their implementation would require only a minimal input o f additional time and resources into the construction o f a new home. These technical considerations could also proactively mitigate problems experienced by subsequent purchasers who, unlike the initial purchaser, do not receive the educational material on living next to natural areas that is distributed under subdivision agreements. Despite their benefits, it may be difficult to amend housing guidelines and/or building codes to make the inclusion o f such design considerations mandatory. In addition, not all measures to protect the home can be implemented pre-sale. As a house settles, small gaps may appear. Over time, weather and use will cause the exterior o f a house to age; roofs rot, concrete cracks and chimneys may become damaged. Eaves troughs need to be regularly cleaned. Preventative screens that are in place can come loose with time. Responsibility will remain with the homeowner to conduct periodic inspections for all o f the above problems and remedy situations that place the home in danger o f nuisance invasions.

6.5.4 Enhance Legislation and Encourage Environmental Compliance
Enhanced technical considerations cannot account for nuisance attractants created by humans that may be unrelated to the design o f the urban development or the natural area. Several respondents stated that the largest threats to the success o f a naturalization project are residential encroachment and dumping. These activities occur primarily due to a lack o f awareness o f the appropriate uses o f natural areas on the part o f adjacent landowners (Mississauga, 2003a). Many residents falsely believe that they are improving the natural area by plarrfing additional vegetative species, mowing or otherwise maintaining the natural area beyond their property line. Natural areas can also be damaged by residents who attempt to similarly justify the dumping o f compost or other biodegradable materials. In certain cases, the:.e behaviours create an additional risk o f attracting nuisance wildlife out o f natural areas and onto residential property. In response to this, the enforcement o f environmental by-laws has been recognized as a tool that could influence resident behaviour to discourage practices that have a negative impact on the environment (Waterloo, 2002). M ost municipalities now have by-laws that prohibit encroachment onto natural areas or any form o f illegal dumping o f wastes. However, only the City o f London was found to have included anti-dumping and anti-encroachment measures into its strategy for the maintenance o f naturalization projects (Arquilla, 1994). This strategy suggests that the by-laws be applied to protect naturalization projects tlirough active site monitoring, followed by cautionary notices (i.e. prepared form letters) and possible disciplinary action to be decided on the individual basis o f each offender. Stronger enforcement o f existing environmental by-laws such as these may also be useful in discouraging negative practices that attract nuisance species.

72

This idea can be farther expanded by tiie proposed creation o f new environmental by-laws designed to discourage human behaviour that is responsible for the local presence and/or overabundance of nuisance species populations. Section 128 o f the Ontario Municipal Act enables a municipality to pass by-laws which prohibit and regulate real or potential public nuisances (Ontario, 2001). For example, the City o f Mississauga has passed a by-law to prescribe standards for nuisance weeds and tall grasses on private lands (By-Law 0267-2003). Among issues o f health and safety, this by-law was created over concerns for all private landscaping that "may create habitats for mosquitos, rodents and other insects and animals" (Mississauga, 2003b). Similarly, under the City o f Mississauga Parks By-Law (277-96), it is prohibited for any person to feed waterfowl in a park "except in a designated area" (Mississauga, 1996). Additional by-laws could be passed by municipalities which would prohibit the feeding o f wildlife in any form. If the use of bird feeders is allowed, the by-law could also stipulate schedules for their appropriate use and maintenance. Where existing, municipal by-laws that govern the proper disposal o f curbside wastes and compost should also be reviewed. However, there are limits to what can be done to prevent nuisances that are encouraged by landowners. As Section 15.1(3) o f the Ontario Building Code Act (1992) enables a municipality to pass by laws prescribing the standards for maintenance o f property within a municipality and Section 127(a) o f the Municipal A ct (2001) enables by-laws requiring the owners of land to clean and clear the land, many municipalities already have by-laws in place to regulate lot and/or property maintenance standards. However, public opposition to the infringement o f residents' property rights can still restrict the ability o f municipalities to pass a by-law on many nuisance attractants. This can include, but is not limited to: the composition o f species in flower and vegetable gardens; specific schedules for the maintenance o f lawns, fruit trees, decorative ponds and barbeques; the repair o f garage doors, decks, roofs and other problems with the house exterior (see Section 6.5.3); and other practices that intentionally or unintentionally provide wildlife with food and shelter (Mississauga, n.d; CFHS, 2004). Even if by-laws governing such actions could be passed, the wide dispersion of such attractants throughout a municipality would make their active monitoring and enforcement extremely difficult.

6.5.5

Encourage Education on Naturalization

Public information is considered to be a critical step in the naturalizaticn process (Arquilla, 1994). At present, public education may be the best available tool to increase tolerance towards naturalization and raise awareness over potential conflicts. This is currently most commonly accomplished by means o f public open houses, naturalization information notices, and signage. A s the most cost-effective long term measure, signage is now a requirement o f naturalization projects in both the City o f M ississauga and the City o f Guelph. As outlined in Section 4.4.3, the information that signs provide may be highly valuable in discouraging encroachment and raising public perceptions o f naturalization projects, particularly during the juvenile, transitional phase when they appear the most unkept. Municipalities with informative and well-positioned signs anticipate more public maintenance and less vandalism to sites (Guelph, 1993; Arquilla, 1994). Enhanced education should also be considered for municipal staff. In 1994, an informal survey o f naturalization site managers in the City o f London found that managers believed park staff to be among the worst offenders o f site degradation (Arquilla, 1994). In response, site managers 73

recommended that quality, informative training programs regarding naturalization are needed for all park staff. Respondents from other municipalities also noted that a lack o f internal communication and coordination has sometimes resulted in the inadvertent destruction o f a naturalization project by staff in other municipal departments. However, it is not just municipal staff that could benefit from enhanced training and education on naturalization. In its Environmental Strategic Plan (2002), the City o f Waterloo foimd that while "a great deal o f information exists about proactive environmental practices that can be applied when managing new growth... [cjurrently it is difficult to access and share this information with all stakeholders". In order to increase this capacity, the Strategic Plan proposes that an annual or bi-annual information-sharing `Development Forum' be held. The desired outcomes of these forums were outlined as follows (Waterloo, 2002); Increased stakeholder communication and awareness; Informed and efficient decision-making process; Better understanding o f the need for different forms o f development; Better understanding between stakeholders; and Recognized divergent views between business and the environment.

· · ·

These forums could be used to encourage the utilization o f more informed landscape design management in the development o f naturalization sites. Municipal staff might also have a lot to add to a forum discussion on the topic o f naturalization and urban development. The survey of naturalization site managers in the City of London (1994), staff expressed their frustration at not being allowed to have more input into issues such as land management, appropriate equipment and public reaction. The insights o f mimicipal staff involved in naturalization are critical to the planning process as they "are the people on the front lines, receiving the complaints and the compliments" (Arquilla, 1994). To this end, the municipality must make itself available for feedback and respond in the best interest o f the community. In the case o f nuisance species, this reactive response must be supplemented by some proactive educational measures. Developers and municipalities are already contributing to community environmental planning by marketing new subdivisions adjacent to natural areas to more environmentally-minded citizens. Through subdivision agreements, these citizens are also provided upon entry with resources that will facilitate their living next to natural areas. Municipalities must also have the capacity to react in advance to provide enhanced public education when changes in land use are likely to result in increased human-wildlife conflicts. This means knowing where naturalization is likely to result in the presence o f nuisance species and providing advance information on, for example, the ecology and behaviour o f coyotes. This could also relate to other changes in municipal policy with a potential impact on wildlife behaviour. One respondent stressed the importance o f informing residents when changes to municipal garbage policy result in new curbside practices that could attract wildlife nuisances.

During this analysis, it was found that each o f the six selected municipalities could significantly improve their capacity to plan for naturalization. The development o f a formalized naturalization policy or program is a good step in this direction, particularly if these policies include a plan or process to locate and rank potential restoration sites. Criteria for prioritization should be clear, and be based on the best available science for site selection and landscape design. These should be reviewed periodically as municipal experiences reveal more about the impacts o f naturalization. Municipalities should also develop a system to improve their understanding o f how restoration designs will be accepted, and therefore, maintained by nearby residents. As outlined by Schauman and Salisbury (1998), " [d]eveloping a strategy for locating restoration is a planning problem, understanding people's responses to and behaviour toward urban green restoration is a design issue". This understanding is fundamental to the success o f naturalization. Restoration that is not valued by citizens in a community will not be maintained. At a minimum, the public must be notified and meaningfully involved in the planning o f local naturalization projects. Communities that are not engaged in the process o f planning and implementing naturalization may not understand or accept the results. Residents concerns for safety, aesthetics and human-wildlife conflict muse be integrated into naturalization landscape design. Enhanced education on naturalization is required for the affected public, as well as for developers, naturalization managers and other municipal staff. Depending on the situation o f a particular city, it is further recommended that municipalities consider implementing some combination o f the proactive best management practices outlined in Section 6.5.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO MUNICIPALITIES

Through improvement o f habitat conditions and the creation o f important migration corridors, many urban environments are now inhabited by a much larger wildlife population than they were several decades ago. However, urban growth also means that the space available to wildlife in the city is increasingly restricted. While most urban residents generally enjoy seeing wildlife, augmented exposure and negative experiences associated with locally overabundant wildlife populations are increasing public concerns over these species. A media analysis conducted over the Summer 2003 has revealed the extent o f some of the major human-wildlife conflicts that exist across Canada. These tensions are predicted to intensify as urban habitats improve or new wildlife populations adjust to living in the urban environment (Hadidian, 1991). As a result^ human-wildlife conflict management has recently emerged as a major concern for both urban plarmers and the sustainability o f urban biodiversity. As traditional techniques for the control o f nuisance species are not well suited to the urban environment, recent research has focused on the development o f new tools that would be adapted to the complexities of urban human-wildlife cohabitaticn (Messmer, 2000; Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001; Fall and Jackson, 2002). However, issues surrounding choice o f methods often remain controversial and politically charged. Using selected municipalities in southern Ontario as an example, this research has explored the development and application o f principles for human-wildlife conflict management in urban areas. Throughout this thesis report, three basic actions have been advocated as measures that any municipality can take to better manage human-wildlife conflicts. These are; 1. 2. 3. Increase their knowledge o f the magnitude and public perception o f conflicts; Increase their knowledge of urban biodiversity to address the ecology of conflicts; and Use the information gained to better plan the location and landscape o f urban natural areas and to enhance residents' willingness to tolerate real or perceived conflicts.

The extent to which the six selected municipalities have recognized the need for and/or have begun to implement these activities has been the focus o f this study.

The objectives o f the research conducted for this thesis include the identification o f best management practices through the examination o f municipal successes, failures and lessons learned on human-wildlife conflict. Through literature reviews and interviews with municipal stakeholders, research for this thesis has revealed that the current municipal capacity for humanwildlife conflict is generally insufficient to deal with growing problems. While most municipalities now realize that nuisance wildlife problems exist, they have not yet recognized the importance o f mitigating the negative wildlife interactions that may result firom expanded naturalization or residential development. In many cases, they are still largely divided on the need to manage urban wildlife nuisances. For most respondents, the presence o f any native wildlife in urban areas is seen as a benefit to urban ecosystems. 76

Municipalities that have taken mitigative action against human-wildlife conflicts commonly rely on two approaches - public education to increase residential tolerance for wildlife and the creation of landscape buffers between natural areas and developments. For major nuisances, various habitat management techniques or exclusionary devices have also been used to deter the colonization o f unwanted species in natural areas. However, weak municipal performance monitoring means that the effectiveness o f these measures is still in question.

7.1.1 Public Perceptions o f Nuisance Conflicts
Understanding the public's perceptions, interest, values and knowledge o f urban wildlife is key not only to effective public education programs but also the selection o f viable damage control options. However, there have yet been few attempts on the part o f selected municipalities to assess public perceptions o f wildlife. O f the six municipalities examined, only the City o f Mississauga was found to have a formalized system for the regular monitoring o f residents' concerns regarding wildlife. This system represents a best management practice as it allows the municipality to use readily available information to understand public perceptions and react to community concerns before they can evolve into crisis situations. By contrast, community surveys conducted on an ad hoc basis after a major nuisance problem has been identified can only be used to avert similar crises if the lessons learned can be applied to future conflict situations. Municipal experience has found that negative perceptions o f wildlife held b}' individuals belt g adversely affected by nuisances can frequently be improved through the provision o f basic information on the ecological value of wildlife in the urban environment. In addition to ecological education, respondents identified a need to raise awareness ainong residents about how human behaviour can influence human-wildlife conflicts. Despite this, there are few public education programs conducted by the selected municipalities that are directly targeted at issues related to human-wildlife conflict mitigation or resolution. Though education in the form o f print and on line resources, public media, and signage have been used to some extent by each o f the selected municipalities, only the City o f Mississauga places a high reliance on public education as th.e primary human-wildlife conflict resolution tool. From the assessment in Section 4, it is clear that public education programs need to become more targeted and accessible if they are to be effective, long-term solutions.

7.1.2 Biodiversity Science and Information
Knowing where conflicts are likely to arise and which species are likely to be involved is key to allowing municipalities to target public education efforts to where they are needed most. Better scientific information on species distribution, abundance and tire ecology o f human-wildlife conflicts is also critical to other management decisions related to wildlife damage control. Unfortunately, it was found that most municipalities either have no information or have only anecdotal information related to the presence and distribution o f nuisance species. Without this data, options for nuisance species control are limited to reactive measures. Decisions taken at crisis points are extreme, confrontational and not designed to allow for adaptive management. Experts have also suggested that in order to preser/e its biodiversity, at a minimum, a city must inventory its open spaces and ecological resources (Andrews and Cranmer-Byng, 1981; Platt et 77

al., 1994; Inoguchi et al., 1999; WHC, 2001). However, it was found that only two of the selected municipalities had completed a BNAI, while two were still in the planning or early implementation phase. Despite having completed a wide range of biodiversity related study initiatives, the lack o f a comprehensive, integrated municipal biodiversity inventory means that the prioritization, implementation and review o f important planning initiatives may not be possible (see Section 7.3).

7.1.3

Nuisances and Naturalization

As naturalization is in many ways still an experimental science, municipalities must recognize the need for adaptive management. There should be flexibility in project design and implementation, and each project should be subject to some form o f monitoring, review and debate. In addition to applicable science, the restoration o f urban open spaces requires two complementary efforts; (I) a plan or process to locate and rank potential restoration sites and (2 ) an understanding o f how restoration will be accepted and maintained by residents (Schauman and Salisbury, 1998; Gobster, 2001). However, research revealed that only four o f the selected municipalities could demonstrate evidence o f having developed a coordinated municipal naturalization policy and/or specific prioritization criteria for their naturalization projects. Though the community is often involved in the planning, implementation and maintenance o f naturalization projects, it has been suggested that the current means o f residential input into site-specific project decisions is too limited for their concerns to have a meaningful influence on project design. As a result, negative ecological or social impacts that result from a particular natura'i-^ation project (such as a residential influx of nuisance species) may go unrecognized until the problem has reached crisis levels.

New solutions for human-wildlife conflict management are needed. However, while it is the objective o f this research to develop principles for best management practices, it is not the objective of this thesis to prescribe specific human-wildlife conflict measures. The selection of human-wildlife conflict measures should be done at the discretion o f the municipality, taking into consideration local conditions, conflicts and the needs o f residents. The selected course o f action taken depends largely on the goal of human-wildlife conflict management (KWS, n.d.). As seen in Figure 7, conflict management options can essentially be divided into four categories - avoidance, prevention, reduction and elimination.

As a strategy, avoidance involves a failure to act or attempts to avoid responsibility. Often the result of a failure to identify nuisance problems, avoidance is equivalent to ignoring a problem that creates real conflicts or risks. This places the burden o f action on individual residents; effectively reducing tolerance for the nuisance and resulting in the implementation of site-specific management techniques. This rarely achieves more than the simple displacement of the nuisance to surrounding areas (Bhat et al., 1996; Belant, 1997). Therefore, while avoidance is currently the most common approach to municipal nuisance wildlife management in southern Ontario, it is not recommended as a an appropriate management strategy. Elimination falls at the other end o f the management spectrum. This option implies the total removal o f conflict, likely through the lethal control o f nuisance wildlife species or the removal o f urban habitat. However, the removal of habitat would have a negative impact on the urban environment that extends far beyond nuisances. In addition, the use o f lethal controls can create concerns for public safety and is unlikely to be tolerated by residents (Fall and Jackson, 2002). As a result, elimination is also not recommended as an appropriate management strategy. Between extremes, prevention and reduction are more feasible and optimal goals. These two management options can be used separately, but are likely more effective if used in combination (KWS, n.d.). Conflict prevention measures are designed to reduce the risk associated with urban wildlife before it impacts residents, such as through the use o f exclusionary devices or proactive habitat modifications. Similarly, assuming that risks associated with nuisance wildlife are inevitable, conflict reduction measures should be established to help minimize the impact o f real or perceived wildlife-related damage. For example, public education and awareness initiatives can reduce the impact of conflicts by increasing residential tolerance to nuisances. Therefore, the first principle for urban human-wildlife conflict management is for municipal agencies to focus on the prevention and reduction o f risks. 79

Secondly, municipalities need to be proactive in implementing measures for prevention and reduction o f human-wildlife conflict. In a study o f urban residents' attitudes towards wildlife, O'Donnell and VanDruff (1983) found that an individual's tolerance for wildlife was lowered by the existence o f a previous problem with a nuisance species. Early identification and mitigation o f real or potential problems is therefore critical to the maintenance o f positive public attitudes towards urban wildlife. Thirdly, effective municipal decisions regarding both nuisances and naturalization management need to be based on the best available information. More than just the development and use of scientific and socio-economic information, this process involves communication. The numerous facets o f human-wildlife conflict management make it relevant to a wide range o f municipal departments, including those that deal with planning, parks and recreation, public works, environmental services, public health and economic development. Consequently, communication among these municipal departments and other relevant municipal agencies should be improved such that they are each involved in the decision-making process. As "wildlife movement is governed by habitat limits and not municipal limits..." such communication must also take place among municipalities to not only assess regional conflicts but also to help ensure a more coordinated approach to management (Kanter, 1990). Lastly, measures for human-wildlife conflict management need to respond to the needs of the community. Communities that are not engaged in the decision-making process may not understand or accept the results. Municipalities must have an appreciation o f the many ways in which urban wildlife either positively or negatively impacts residents' quality o f life.

As stated by Le Lay and Hubert-Moy (2001), "there are still no tools sufficiently adapted to the complexities o f human wildlife cohabitation in cities". If this is true, then how can the above principles be turned into practice? The answer is perhaps that municipalities do not require the development o f just one tool, but rather an integrated approach that considers all available management options. Based in part on the findings o f other researchers, the following three recommendations suggest complementary measures that can be implemented to help improve municipal capacity for humanwildlife conflict. Each o f the recommendations integrates the four best management principles outlined above. Numerous additional management options (i.e. `tools') for the prevention and reduction o f conflicts have been recommended throughout this report.

Recommendation 1: Create a Nuisance Management Working Group
Issues surrounding choice o f methods for human-wildlife conflict management remain controversial and politically charged. As there is not one single agency with a lead role in wildlife management, many municipalities remain largely divided not only on how to manage, but also on what to manage. Furthermore, as naturalization and urban wildlife management are still in an experimental phase, there is no guarantee that methods selected will have wide-scale effectiveness. In addition, the migratory and opportunistic nature o f nuisance wildlife populations 80

means that control activities that are effective at one site will rarely solve a nuisance problem across a larger management area. Due to the controversial nature o f human-wildlife conflict management and the problems commonly associated with site-specific nuisance control, researchers have recommended that an integrated, landscape-level approach to management be used to reduce the frequency and severity o f conflicts in the urban environment (Bhat et al., 1996; Belant, 1997; WHC, 2001). Under this scenario, a centralized working group comprised of relevant government and non-govemment stakeholders, the development industry, private citizens, wildlife experts and other interested stakeholders would be formed to provide overall direction for nuisance species management (Belant, 1997). As suggested by Belant (1997), the primary functions o f such a working group would be: 1. 2. 3. 4. Assessing the nature and extent of nuisance problems; Defining relevant aspects o f the ecology and interactions o f nuisance species; Developing an integrated management plan to address the problem(s); and Periodically evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness o f the management program.

While one landowner is unlikely to exercise sufficient control, coordinated management across the municipality or the watershed can result in cooperative solutions to common problems. Facilitating public input into this process will require more time and resources. However, public participation will enhance the credibility o f the working group. It will also benefit the municipality by providing stakeholders with increased opportunity to become more knowledgeable about management options and will ultimately result in more public ownership o f the outcome (Messmer, 2000).

Recommendation 2: Develop Integrated Nuisance Management (INM) Plans
In keeping with the primary functions o f the centralized working group, it is further recommended that urban municipalities develop integrated nuisance management (INM) plans to systematically and proactively address human-wildlife conflicts that arise in the city. Similar to the concept o f integrated pest management (IPM)'^, the INM would be a decision making model used to prevent and manage nuisance problems that are o f concern to residents. The goal o f the INM would not be to eliminate nuisance wildlife, but rather to keep nuisances at acceptable levels as determined by ecological and socio-economic study. Developed through the input of the centralized working group and other community consultations, the INM would apply to all municipal departments and contractors who directly or indirectly manage wildlife. This includes those who plan, design, renovate or construct landscapes and facilities.

^ As integrated pest management is most frequently used to minimize the use o f potentially harmful pest control products (e.g. pesticides), most programs for IPM define a `pest' as an organism that can be treated with such products (London, 2003a). This is not the case for many urban `nuisance' organisms.

Procedures for the development o f appropriate urban nuisance management techniques have been established through the IPM o f various Canadian municipalities (Calgary, 1998; London, 2003a). These procedures include the following four steps^^: 1. Identify, monitor and assess the nature and extent o f nuisance problem(s). In order to effectively manage human-wildlife conflicts, the conflicts must first be understood. As a result, identification is the first and most crucial step in integrated nuisance management. Problem identification may also be more effective if supplemented by a process o f problem visualization such as the computerized map o f risk for humanwildlife conflict that will be outlined in Recommendation 3. Some major nuisances (e.g. deer, waterfowl and other overabundant species) have already been identified. However, in most cases this first step vrill require municipalities to begin monitoring residential experiences with nuisance species to determine the types o f real or perceived conflicts, the locations where problems occur, and the type and approximate number of species involved. This monitoring can also be used to estimate residential, municipal or ecological risk or loss as a result o f problems. Additional information on the ecology of nuisance species (for example, time o f the year when present or m ost active) will aid in determining when and where control management activities need to be conducted. 2. Use this assessment to determine the appropriate level and tim ing o f action(s). The general goal of m ost naturalization projects is to establish an ecologically balanced landscape, and thus project objectives often include increasing species diversity and abundance in a given area. As a result, the recolonization o f natural areas by native `nuisance' species is generally not a concern for wildlife and open space managers and should not require any action. However, this `do nothing' approach to management should not to be confused with `avoidance'. Once monitoring reveals conflict with the surrounding area, the `do nothing' option may no longer be feasible. Appropriate timing and levels o f action for the management o f a particular nuisance species should be determined on the basis o f real and/or perceived risks to residents and urban ecology. Tolerance to pests is a subjective concept that will also require further municipal study. Past studies have found that residential tolerance levels for nuisances are likely to vary with the type o f species and the area o f the city where the species is found (O'Donnell and VanDruff, 1983; Hadidian, 1991). Residential tolerance will also vary on a site-by-site basis; whether the species is in the home, on the property, or in an adjacent natural area (London, 2003a).

The principles for IPM are often divided into five steps rather than four, with pest identification and pest monitoring outlined as separate procedures (London, 2003 a).

The scientific methods required to determine ecological tolerance levels are n o t the subject o f this report. However, according to the testimony o f respondents, it is important to note that there m ay be considerable difference in residential tolerance levels and the ecological carrying capacity for a particular species. For example, as an introduced species, the Mute swan can pose a significant threat to the ecology o f a natural area. Despite this, public preference for swans m eans that their population is often maintained while other native species (e.g. Canada goose) are removed (Hindman, n.d,). In addition, a lack o f basic ecological information on the value o f species means that other species that are beneficial to the ecology o f a natural area (e.g, pollinators and top predators) may also not be tolerated by residents. In such cases, tolerance levels need not be reached in order for action to be taken. Many treatments for human-wildlife conflict management that are considered environmentally benign - for example, public education and mitigative landscape design - can and should be implemented on a proactive basis. 3. Review all possible treatment techniques and select the m ost appropriate. Once the need for action has been determined, steps to deal w ith the nuisance should be taken. As outlined in Section 3.4.2, there is a wide range o f wildlife damage management techniques that exist and can b e used in different situations w ith varying effectiveness. The m ost frequently cited techniques include: habitat management; food source management; averse conditioning; exclusion; repellents; capture, removal and relocation; nest/egg disturbance; anti-fertility programs; introduction o f natural predators; and lethal methods. Again, landscape-level management techniques are preferred to site-specific management as this helps reduce the possibility that the nuisance problem will be displaced or dispersed in the municipality. Screening criteria should be established to evaluate the suitability o f each action with respect to the particular problem and desired nuisance management objectives. The ultim ate decision as to which nuisance management strategy to follow should include the consideration o f many practical factors: conflict distribution, species ecology, human and financial resources, the costs and benefits o f nuisance management techniques and public opinion. One example o f this suggested screening criteria process is outlined in Table 13.

In many cases, human-wildlife management conflicts are better resolved by managing the behaviour o f residents than the behaviour o f species. Several researchers have found that enhancing tolerance is not only a highly effective strategy, but is also more readily accepted by residents than active population controls (Messmer, 2000; Fall and Jackson, 2002). As a result, the selection o f treatment techniques should consider options for both species management and human behaviour/perception management. It is also important to note that not all treatment strategies are reactive (see Figure 8 ). According to the City o f Calgary 1PM (1998), site management, rehabilitation and long term management are the three most essential elements in a successful IPM program. In addition, higher levels o f program effectiveness are achieved by placing a greater emphasis on problem assessment, problem prevention through improved site design, and the establishment o f greater levels o f nuisance tolerance. Though untested, the same can likely be said for INM. Figure 8 demonstrates how the development o f an INM Plan can allow a municipality to easily integrate the different treatment strategies for the management o f current and probable pest problems that have been proposed throughout this report.

Periodically evaluate the effectiveness o f the selected course o f actions, and revise as necessary. As w ith any good management system, INM requires that monitoring continue following the im plem entation o f human-wildlife interface control measures. This will allow staff responsible for the INM to evaluate the effectiveness and make any necessary program adjustments. This review can also serve as a source o f information on best management practices, with the lessons learned applied to improve practices elsewhere in the city and to help reduce the chance o f similar nuisance problems in the future.

The feasibility o f this recommendation is demonstrated by the fact that each o f the six selected municipalities has no w implemented some form o f integrated pest management system for the maintenance o f public lands. However, while four municipalities have integrated the principles o f 1PM into a plant health care (PHC) program, only Guelph and London have established an actual Integrated Pest M anagement Plan. For increased efficiency, the INM could also be integrated into a larger municipal initiative for integrated pest management. For example, following the lead o f other Canadian cities, the City o f Calgary began implementation o f its Integrated Pest Management Plan in 1998.^'' Though initiated by a desire to reduce its reliance on pesticides, the City o f Calgary 1PM is innovative as it. is designed to help manage every kind o f natural "pest" . This includes not only injurious plants, insects and rodents, but also larger vertebrate wildlife such as beavers and Richardson ground squirrels.

3:Computerized Maps o f Risk fo r Human-Wildlife Conflict

U rban planners in other jurisdictions that have already attempted to implement an integrated approach to nuisance management have found the process hindered by a lack o f problem visualization (Le lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001). Therefore, to help facilitate the implementation o f municipal IN M Plans it is recommended that " [a] cartographic approach is needed to integrate all the different components o f human wildlife interactions, to analyze their connections and spatial distribution in the city, to increase urban knowledge, and to identify courses o f action" (Le Lay and Hubert-M oy, 2001). Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can be used to help urban planners and other municipal decision-makers complete a wide variety o f tasks including preliminary data processing, data storage and retrieval, spatial searches and analysis, and spatial interaction modeling (Jones, 1997). By combining analytical and mapping capacities, the use o f GIS can assist in not only the visualization o f urban problems, but also their comprehension, communication and resolution.

As a result, the popularity o f GIS among urban planners has now grown significantly (Jones, 1997; Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001). In fact, the majority o f the municipalities selected for study already use GIS for the conduct o f programs related to general environmental maintenance, such as ecological land classification, environmental impact assessment, natural heritage mapping and street tree inventories. Other municipalities, such as the City o f Guelph, have made commitments to create and maintain GIS layers for monitoring natural areas within the next four years (Guelph, 2003a). Therefore, the shift from current uses o f GIS to human-wildlife conflict management is simplified as urban planners have the software, expert knowledge and some o f the critical georeferenced, digital data already in hand. Researchers have demonstrated how the applications o f GIS can help urban planners resolve specific human-wildlife conflicts, by using individual problem species as a case study (see Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001). According to Le Lay and Hubert-Moy (2001), methods used to map risks for human-wildlife conflict management in an urban area can be divided into three main steps: 1. Identification o f wildlife problem components and factors affecting them. Wildlife problem components can be separated into five categories o f risk - (I) physical risks, such as wildlife attacks; (2 ) epidemiological risk, such as the spread o f disease and allergens; (3) ecological risk, such as competition or predation; (4) property damage risks; and (5) economic pressures. In order to develop a computerized map o f risk, it is essential to first identify which components are linked to the presence o f a particular nuisance wildlife species in the urban area. Second, it is important to identify the severity o f those risks. Each facet o f risk can be discussed and ranked on the basis o f scientific and/or urban expert and community input. As problems between wildlife and people are generally brought about by the accumulation o f smaller problems, it is essential to identify not only the problem components but also the links among various factors. 2. Collection o f multi-disciplinary data on wildlife problem components. Le Lay and Hubert-Moy (2001) have divided data needs into two categories - `wildlife potentials' and `urban vulnerability'. `Wildlife potentials' refer to the risk in relation to the presence of a species in the urban area, expressed by the species' capacity for conflict by coming into contact with the community, their property, or other wildlife species. To show how this may vary in time, space or intensity, data collected under this category will require the study o f the size, spatial distribution, and urban movement patterns o f the given species population. The temporal analysis of these factors should include not only diurnal and seasonal fluctuations, but also information on species colonization where available.^' Existing data on species habitat and resource availability may be a good starting point for where species data is unknown or incomplete, but the use o f these variables alone as a proxy for species data will severely limit the accuracy o f results.

j

^^Unfortunately, this temporal analysis will be limited by the availability o f historical species data.

`Urban vulnerability' refers to the risk related to the social, economic, and epidemiological response o f the urban centre to the presence o f a given wildlife species. A sound comprehension o f the public perception o f risk is then essential as it determines the classification o f different factors involved in urban vulnerability, and thus the success of the resulting analysis. Other input data could include the physical distribution of buildings and vegetated patches at risk o f property damage, the sociodemographic distribution of vulnerable segments of the human population, political vulnerability o f different jurisdictions, or administrative vulnerability associated with varying land use restrictions. 3. Drawing o f different map layers and o f final map o f risk by using GIS. One limitation or consideration for the data that is collected is that it must be georeferenced. Georefsrenced data can then be input into GIS software selected at the discretion o f the municipality, and maps can be created to express different aspects of wildlife potentials and urban vulnerability. After these initial map-, are created, an overall map o f risk can be drawn up by overlaying different risk componeixts (see Figure 9).

The map of risk is created and analysed based on the expectation that:

Risk o f Human-Wildlife Conflict = Wildlife Potentials x Urban Vulnerability

At the end of the process, decision-makers will evaluate the current situation or even future alternatives based on the use of best available data. If developed and used correctly, computerized maps of risk can be important tools not just for the comprehension and visualization of the problem situation by urban planners and wildlife managers, but also by the public affected by a species. A well-developed risk mapping process can also reduce the costs of actions carried out by the city, as it allows decision-makers to anticipate conflicts and take early action in heavy risk areas as well as increase efficiency by summing the effects of various actions made in several places at the same time (Le Lay and Hubert-Moy, 2001). Unfortunately, the existing lack o f comprehensive, integrated information on the public perception or ecology and dynamic nature o f urban nuisance species means that it will be diflScult for municipalities in southern Ontario to achieve the efficiencies that could be made possible by each of the ,e three recommendations. As with any decision model, a lack of good input data will likely result in a lack o f good results. However, this should not discourage municipalities from working toward a goal o f enhanced human-wildlife conflict management - one step at a time.

St u d y - I n t e r v ie w Q u e s t io n s

Please N ote: The exact order and the precise wording o f the open-ended questions w ill be molded to suit the interview - the number and type o f questions asked w ill be directly related to the role that you play in your municipality. You will not be asked to elaborate on questions for which documentation is available. A. Background Information I will begin by collecting some basic background information about the role that you and your department or division play in the City o f XX. The information collected here will allow me to build some context around the answers that you give during the rest o f the interview. 1. 2. Briefly describe the position that you hold in the City o f XX. Do you believe that there are any aspects o f your jo b as XX that relate to the management o f wildlife and/or nuisance species? I f so, please describe.

B. Public Perceptions o f Nuisance Species The focus of this thesis research is on understanding the issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts caused by `nuisance' species o f wildlife. Nuisance species are those that are involved in any real or perceived negative interactions with humans. Some examples o f wildlife that are commonly considered an urban nuisance can include, but are in no way limited to coyotes, deer, raccoons, beavers, skunks, geese, and seagulls. In addition to posing potential health and safety problems, the management o f such species can also translate into significant financial costs for both the municipality and private citizens. 1. In your opinion, how is wildlife generally viewed by residents o f the City o f XX? Is wildlife viewed as a nuisance, a benefit to society, or a combination o f botli? Please describe how urban wildlife is commonly dealt w ith in the City o f XX. If the City o f XX has a public policy (or published guidelines) on the control o f nuisance species in the municipality, please describe and/or provide documentation if available. To your knowledge, are there any initiatives to monitor wildlife complaints or evaluate public perceptions o f wildlife in the City o f XX? I f yes, please describe. Provide documentation if available. If the initiative is conducted by an organization outside the municipal government, please specify. Are you aware o f any initiatives, such as public education campaigns, that might affect public perceptions o f wildlife in the City o f XX? If yes, please describe. Provide documentation if available. If the initiative is conducted by an organization outside the municipal government, please specify. 99

c . Biodiversity Science and Information In order to effectively m a n ^ e human-wildlife conflicts, tire conflicts m ust first be understood. Planning for conservation is a process that uses scientific data. For effective management, ecological data and analysis m ust be available to and be understood by those who will be affected by the decisions being made. M uch recent attention has been given to biological diversity in Canadian cities. However, while there is much encouraging progress at the level o f policy, studies have found that relevant biological data and the ability to use this data to predict changes to the environment as a result o f land use decisions are still in short supply. 1. A natural or open space can include many types o f urban habitat - parks, conservation areas, unused or abandoned lands, stream corridors, wetlands, forests, wildfiower meadows, etc. W hat type o f information on natural and open spaces is currently available for use by the municipality in planning and operations? If this information includes an inventory o f natural and open spaces, please describe the inventory process and results and/or provide documentation if available. What type o f information on urban wildlife is currently available for use by the municipality in planning and operations? If this information includes an inventory o f wildlife in the city (that is separate from the natural and open spaces inventory), please describe the inventory process and results and/or provide documentation if available.

2.

D. Plaiming for Naturalization Projects To enhance opportunities for urban biodiversity, there has been a recent trend towards the integration o f unused open space resources into the municipal land use system. This is most often accomplished through naturalization and green space restoration projects, where open spaces are either left untouched to allow for natural regrowth or are purposefully landscaped to reestablish some of their pre-development character. This process also requires scientific data, not only to understand and improve the natural landscape design but also to predict the impacts that this landscape change might have on the natural environment and the surrounding community. To be effective, interventions to restore natural areas must ensure that the outcome is improvement, and not further impoverishment. 1. In the past ten years, have there been any naturalization projects undertaken in the City o f XX? Please describe and/or provide documentation if available - focus on project successes, failures and lessons learned. I f the projects were conducted by an organization outside the municipal government, please specify. W hat type o f information or criteria - physical, biological and/or demographic - are used when planning naturalization projects? Please describe how this information is used.

3.

Community support can have a large influence on the long-term success o f a naturalization project. Among other factors, community attitudes toward ecological restoration are related to their knowledge about the project and their perceptions o f the outcomes. W hat is the level o f community involvement in planning, implementing or maintaining naturalization projects? The restoration o f urban green spaces has been demonstrated to attract a wide variety o f `nuisance' species. Do planners consider this in naturalization project design? If any human-wildlife conflicts have arisen as a result o f naturalization projects, please describe the nature of the conflict and the reaction o f the community.

4.

Municipal Partnerships for Naturalization Please note that the following question is targeted to subjects that work for organizations outside the municipal government, such as Conservation Authorities, who play an important role in open space restoration. 1. Do you work in partnership with the City o f XX to design and/or implement your naturalization projects? I f yes, please describe the nature o f this partnership.

This Appendix is designed to supplement understanding of the six municipalities selected for study with contextual background information. The following municipal profiles are provided to add some description to the above Table. City of H am ilton In January 2001, the Towns o f Ancaster, Dundas and Flamborough, the Township o f Glanbrook, the City of Hamilton and City o f Stoney Creek were amalgamated to form the new City o f Hamilton. By population, the City o f Hamilton is currently the 9* largest urban municipality in Canada and the 4* largest in Ontario. According to the 2001 Census, Hamilton's population is 490,270 - after adjusting for the Census undercount, Hamilton's population is estimated to be over 503,000. Hamilton's population growth rate between 1996 and 2001 is estimated at 4.8% (Hamilton, 2003). While 97% of residents live in urban areas, the City's large area means that only 20.15% o f the municipal land use is considered urban (Dwyer et al, 2002). The Parks Division of the City of Hamilton Public Works Department is responsible for the maintenance o f an "extensive inventory" o f municipal parks and open spaces. A t present, the City maintains 1,078 ha of parkland at 310 locations, in addition to 549 ha o f natural area at 32 locations and 137 km o f recreational trails. However, due in part to its location on the Niagara Escarpment and in the biological transition zone between two major forest regions, approximately 20% o f the City (23,000 ha) has been identified as environmentally significant (Hamilton, 2001; Dwyer et al, 2002). The present distribution o f natural areas in Hamilton has been determined largely by geographic factors. Natural areas in Hamilton include both undeveloped lands - areas that are either protected or have been found unsuitable to development - and previously disturbed lands that are reverting to a more natural state either spontaneously (post-abandonment) or deliberately (Dwyer et al., 2002 ). City of Guelph As a separated City, Guelph does not form part o f the County system o f government. By the end o f 2003, it is estimated that the total population o f the City o f Guelph reached 113,00 people. The City o f Guelph has experienced an average annual growth rate of approximately 2% over the past ten years. Due to a decline in the average household size, the number of households in Guelph is increasing at a faster rate than the population. As a result, Guelph has recognized a need to accommodate that population through the development of more dwelling units on the 1160 ha of land that is currently designated for residential use (Guelph, 2003c). While the Official Plan for the City of Guelph allocates 11.5 ha of open space per 1000 population, the City is required to supply only 3.3 ha/1000. The City o f Guelph Parks Department is the steward o f approximately 565 ha o f parkland in over 100 parks across the City, o f which only 251 ha is maintained by extensive horticultural techniques. In addition, respondents 103

from the City o f Guelph suggested that the relative lack o f urban nuisances in the municipal core could be attributed to the City's urban configuration and linkages. The following is a general description o f this configuration: "The Guelph open space system is dominated by the presence o f the Speed and Eramosa Rivers that, together, form the shape o f a wishbone as they meander through the heart of the City. A good deal of the corridor that contains the rivers is in public ownership, and has been shaped and tied together into a variety of types o f parks... and natural river shoreline and wetlands" (Guelph, 1997). Located near the northern extreme of the Carolinian forest ecosystem, Guelph is home to Canada's first Canadian Heritage River to be designated in a highly settled area (Guelph, 2000). In 1993, the City o f Guelph developed a Green Plan as the first step in a strategic planning process designed to move Guelph towards a vision o f environmental sustainability (Guelph, 1997). In 2001, the City adopted an updated "green" Official Plan. In 2003, the approval of a Environmental Action Plan furthered the effective implementation of these policies (Guelph, 2003b). City of Burlington The City of Burlington is the largest o f four municipalities in the Regional Municipality o f Halton. It was incorporated as a City in 1974. Part o f a highly urbanized corridor, the City o f Burlington is located between Hamilton and Toronto. Similar to Hamilton, there is a clear geographical division between its urban and agricultural areas. While the majority o f residents live in urban areas, the City's large area means that only 43.32% of the municipal land use is considered urban (Burlington, 2004). Burlington contains 1,148 ha of parkland, of which 490 h a is maintained by the City. Environmentally significant areas include parts o f the Niagara Escarpment and the shoreline for Lake Ontario (Burlington, 1998). According to its Official Plan (1997), Burlington was declared a "sustainable city" in 1989. City of Mississauga The City of Mississauga is the largest municipality in the Region of Peel. It was incorporated as a City in 1974. With its population estimated at 624,000, Mississauga is currently the 6 * largest and fastest growing City in Canada (Statscan, 2002). It is also one o f the most multicultural, with close to 50% of residents bom outside o f Canada (Statscan, 2001). The City of Mississauga maintains 481 parks and 25 major trail systems. However, the City's Natural Areas Survey (2000) has identified 144 additional remnant natural areas under both private and public ownership. These comprise 7% of the City land base. Since the late 1980s, the City of Mississauga has been involved in the naturalization o f over 200 sites and more than 303 ha 104

of public land. Located at the intersection o f two major forest regions, Mississauga maintains a great diversity o f species (Mississauga, 2002). Approximately 80% of the natural areas in Mississauga are associated with watershed valley systems (Mississauga, 2002). The majority o f the City lies within the southern extreme o f the Credit Valley watershed. The Credit Valley Conservation (CVC) Authority is viewed as being highly progressive in terms o f watershed management. For example, the CVC was selected as the pilot-test watershed for the Ontario Ecological Land Classification (ELC) System, now in standard use across the province. City o f W aterloo The City of Waterloo is the largest municipality in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. The Region of Waterloo was created as a new upper tier of municipal government in 1973. The Laurel Creek Watershed drains most o f the lands within the City o f Waterloo. Approximately half o f this area is currently under urban development, with the majority o f this being concentrated in the lower half o f the watershed (GRCA, 1993). Between 1996 and 2001, the population of the City o f Waterloo grew by approximately 11% (Statscan, 2001). The current population for the City is estimated at 102,300 people (Waterloo, 2004). The City of Waterloo adopted an `Environment First' Policy in 1989. As a result, environmental considerations have since been strategically integrated into all City business units (Waterloo, 1999). For example, the City has now developed an interdepartmental Environmental Coordination Team and has engaged a variety of stakeholders in a Mayor's Environmental Task Force. Over the past 15 years, the City has designed the West Side of Waterloo so that the natural environment can be preserved. Among other things, this means that all wetlands, woodlands and creeks in West Side Waterloo are protected from development by surrounding naturalized buffer areas and living fence property lines (Waterloo, 1998a). The City of Waterloo now maintains 757 ha o f public parks and green spaces which include more than 100 km o f community trails. As o f 1999, the City's woodlands totaled 688 ha o f which 317.4 ha was under public ownership. This is the equivalent o f 46.1% o f the City's remaining woodland cover (Waterloo, 1999). O f the six selected municipalities, the City o f Waterloo was found to have the only public policy on wildlife in the City. This policy states that: "When general nuisance incidents are caused by wildlife on private property, the City of Waterloo will provide the homeowner with assistance in the form o f information about animal control procedures and a list o f companies that can respond to their needs. When animal populations have become a general nuisance as defined by the city, or are contributing to a watershed area problem by impeding water flows or destroying habitat, the City o f Waterloo will take appropriate action to remove, relocate or reduce the population of wildlife" (Waterloo, 1998b).

City o f London

The City of London was incorporated as a City in 1855. The last major annexation o f the City occurred in 1961. Currently the largest City in Middlesex County, London's population was estimated at 336,539 people in 2001. This represents a population increase o f 3.3% since 1996 (Statscan, 2001). The population is not only becoming increasingly ethnically diverse, but is also rapidly aging (London, 2003b). The City of London currently maintains over 280 parks, open spaces and environmentally significant areas, with more than 60 km o f community trails. These 2,038 ha of municipal open space result in an actual supply o f 6 ha per 1000 population. However, this open space is not equitably distributed as older, more developed parts o f the City fall considerably short of this standard (London, 2003b). Often referred to as the "Forest City", the City currently maintains 155,640 trees (approx. 120 species) o f which 32,101 are in managed parks. This total does not include those in unmanaged natural areas. At present, the purported overabundance o f White-tailed deer in London's Sifton Bog is likely its most controversial environmental planning issues. Sifton Bog is an Environmentally Significant Area and Provincially Significant Wetland located in west London, virtually surrounded by residential neighbourhoods. Using the OMNR standard for White-tailed deer carrying capacity of .05 deer per hectare, the Bog would be expected to be able to support a resident population o f 3 deer. However, more than 45 deer have been observed in the Bog (London, 2003c). Note on Conservation Authorities The jurisdiction o f Ontario's Conservation Authorities is organized on a watershed basis. As natural watersheds do not respect political boundaries, a given Conservation Authority will generally have jurisdiction in several municipalities. Similarly, the political boundary of many municipalities is not contained by just one watershed. For the purposes o f this research, a municipality is considered to be part o f a particular Conservation Authority's jurisdiction if the majority of the municipal land base falls within the Authority's planning area. During interviews, respondents for Conservation Authorities with jurisdiction over several municipalities were asked to target their response to activities conducted in the selected municipality in question.

F8. beaver is valued by society of one o f Canada's national symbols but is also an ecological pest as a result o f its industriousness; main problem is that natural predators of beavers are not viable in urban areas and thus lethal measures must be taken to manage population levels. beaver is listed in Calgary as a "problem animal" (along with Norway rats, moles, magpies and raccoons), and info for their control is posted on the City o f Calgary website. Estimated 1,500-3,000 beavers in City result in destruction of urban forest. Toronto has beavers in Don, Rouge and Humber rivers that create concerns similar to those in Calgary; however, T.O. beavers are being welcomed as natural part of urban fauna and protective measures rather than lethal measure are taken (e.g. Toronto's more valuable/vulnerable trees are protected by metal wraps).
