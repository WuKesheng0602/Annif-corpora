ABSTRACT
Bench-Scale Study o f Aqueous MTBE Degradati.6n by Combined Advanced Oxidation and Biological ^ o c e sse s
Azadeh Asadi MASc, Chemical Engineering Program Ryerson university Toronto, 2004. The oxidation o f methyl /e/V-butyl ether (MTBE) by advanced oxidation processes in conjunction with biological treatment is investigated. First, the degradation o f MTBE by U V /H 2 O2 and U V /TiO ] is studied. It is found that the optimum molar ratio o f H 2 O 2/M TBE is about 14 while the optimum concentration o f Ti02 is 1.5 g/L. In addition, it is observ'ed that a combined process o f U V /H 2 O2 and U V/Ti02 does not have any advantages over each o f these processes alone. In the second phase, biodegradability o f MTBE by aerobic microorganisms is evaluated in three different approaches including BODu assessment, removal of MTBE by non-acclimated, and acclimated

microorganisms. . It is shown that the acclimatization o f microorganisms enhances the rate o f biodégradation o f MTBE. Finally, it is observed that the rate o f bioreaction is not improved after a photochemical pre-treatment. It is also found that using the integration o f photochemical and biological treatment reduces the total residence time.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

Today one o f the most important global issues is water because o f its limited and valuable sources in the world. For many years, suspension materials were separated mechanically and dissolved pollutants were biologically treated. However, the global growth o f the population, the rapid Industrial development, and human activities over the last centuries have resulted in more environmental problems.

The most used treatment process for the removal o f organic substances from water and wastewater is the biological oxidation. This old method o f treatment is not able to satisfy the requirements o f acceptable treated water and wastewater. The complexity and the development o f industries in recent years have resulted in new pollutants in wastewater, which cannot be degraded easily by only biological treatment methods. These are effluents from different industries that are mostly toxic and not biodegradable. On the other hand, the cheapness and the availability o f biological treatment are its main advantages.

Activated sludge is a widely accepted method o f decreasing dissolved organic materials in wastewater when these substances are biodegradable. I f they are resistant to biodégradation or the high reaction rate is a matter o f importance, advanced oxidation or chemical processes are applied. Two important methods that are used for the removal o f

contaminants are phase transfer and oxidation. Different methods o f phase transfer are adsorption on granular activated carbon, extraction, and air stripping. These methods only lead pollutants from one phase to another, therefore, they are becoming unpopular. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are suitable substitute for phase transfer methods for the removal o f contaminants from wastewater, but compared w ith physical and biological treatments, these methods are expensive. Over the two past decades, the interest o f exploitation o f photooxidation processes for water and wastewater treatment has grown rapidly and chemical 'oxidation o f dissolved pollutants is significantly being considered. In order to enhance the efficiency o f the degradation o f contaminants, many attempts have been performed to combine different advanced oxidation processes with biological treatment because integration o f chemical and biological processes may result in a more cost-effective method o f treatment. The application o f both chemical and biological treatments needs optimization o f the dose o f chemicals as well as residence time in each process.

In this study, methyl /erZ-butyl ether (M TBE) was chosen as model compound since it has been used in gasoline increasingly and its application has raised many safety concerns. Low level o f MTBE makes drinking water unusable because o f its taste and odour. Available data support that MTBE is a potential human carcinogen at high doses (EPA, 2003). One o f the goals o f this study was to investigate the feasibility o f photodegradation o f M TBE by means o f U V /H 2 O2 , UV/TiOz, and their combination along w ith the evaluation o f the efficiency o f each process. The optimum amount o f H 2 O2 and T i 0 2 was determined, the rate o f M TBE decomposition was examined and rate

constants were estimated. Another objective was to assess the biodégradation o f MTBE. First the toxicity o f M TBE and its by-products o f photooxidation were investigated. Then the biodégradation o f M TBE was examined by three approaches, measurement o f ultimate BOD for different concentrations o f MTBE, degradation o f M TBE by nonacclimated activated sludge, and the degradation o f MTBE by acclimated activated sludge. In the next step, the effect o f photocatalysis on the biodegradability o f MTBE was studied. Finally, the retention time in each chemical and biological reactor in an integrated process was optimized and a cost-efficiency method o f treatment was proposed.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW

2,1. MTBE: History and its Effect On The Environment
Methyl tertiary butyl ether (M TBE) is a chemical compound, which is formed by reaction between methanol and isobutylene and Miracca, 1997; Jacobs et ah, 2001): he presence o f an acidic catalyst (Trotta

Since 1979, M TBE has replaced the lead to enhance octane number in gasoline. Additives (alcohols and ethers) enter more oxygen to gasoline, which increase the combustion efficiency (Uhler et ah, 2001). For its oxygen content, M TB E can be added to gasoline up to 15% (v) to reduce the emission o f CO in inter-combustion engines (Jacobs et ah, 2001). In I980' s, the production o f M TBE was increased in US and il was in the list o f top 50 chemicals produced there (Uhler et ah, 2001). Since 1992, MTBE was added to gasoline at higher concentrations to accomplish the oxygenate necessities, set by Congress in the 1990 Clean A ir Amendments. MTBE production in the U.S.A. was over 200,000 barrels per day in 1999 (EPA, 2003). Its production is economical and easy. Without separating from gasoline, M TBE can be blend simply and transferred through existing pipelines, therefore, most o f the refineries prefer M TBE because o f its economic reasons (Squillace et ah, 1997).

M TBE enters groundwater and soil by leaking aboveground and underground storage fuel tanks, pipelines, refuelling spills, automobile accidents damaging the fuel tank, disposal o f old gasoline, marine engines, storm water runoff, and precipitation mixed w ith MTBE in the air. Its high solubility causes M TB E to transfer to water more than other gasoline compounds (EPA, 2003). In the early and m id 1990's, a low amount o f M TBE was reported in groundwater (Uhler et al., 2001). U.S. Geological survey has announced that M TB E is the second detected chemical in shallow ambient groundwater (Squillace et al., 1997). Some events have increased concerns about the healthiness o f MTBE. In 1996, Santa Monica city, U.S.A., shut down two wellfields supplying drinking water because o f the contamination o f M TBE at a level as high as 610 and
86

ppb (EPA,

2003). In 1992, EPA considered Draft Health Advisory fo r M TB E equal to 20-200 p. g/L in drinking water, which was changed to 20-40 p g /L in 1997. In 1999, the amount o f 13 p g /L as health advisory action level was confirmed by the state o f California (Uhler et al.,
2001

).

There are many debates about MTBE. Some believe that M TB E has caused cleanburning fuels production and some suppose that MTBE results in diseases. The air quality office o f U.S. EPA supported M TBE as an automobile emission reducing agent (Jacobs et al., 2001). The current data indicate a low level o f M TB E and in lim ited number o f detections, higher levels o f contamination in surface and groundwater were observed. Almost 1% o f detections are higher than 20 pg/L. Higher concentrations more than 20 p g /L o f MTBE in water supply have been observed where reformulated gasoline (RFG)

is sold (EPA, 2003). The concentration o f 200 mg/L M TB E in groundwater has been reported. In California, M T B E concentration o f surface water, where recreational boats were working, was reported as 12 mg/L (Jacobs et al., 2001).

2.1.1. Properties o f MTBE

M olecular weight o f M TBE is 88.14 g/mol. Usually hydrocarbons with molecular weight o f less than 150 g/mol are completely volatile and have low melting and boiling points w ith high vapour pressure. M TB E melts at -109°C and boils at 53.655.2°C. M TBE tends to move downwards because it is adsorbed by soil easily, so it

reaches to groundwater relatively quickly. M TBE solubility in water at standard pressure and temperature is 4.8%, which is relatively high (Jacobs et al, 2000). Henry' s law defines the partitioning o f a contaminant between aqueous and vapour phases. Henry's law constant fo r a compound is the ratio o f partial pressure o f compound in vapour phase to compound concentration in aqueous phase in a specific temperature. To estimate the tendency for volatility from water to air, the value o f Henry' s law constant is more suitable than either vapour pressure or water solubility. It has been shown that compounds with Henry' s law constants equal or more than 5x10"^ atm-m^/mole are very volatile from water and compounds w ith lower values tend to remain in aqueous phase or i f the contaminated gas is in contact w ith water, they tend to transfer to aqueous phase (Sequillace et al., 1997). According to this classification, the Henry' s law constant for M TBE shows that it would partition significantly with water.

Although M TBE is less toxic than other components o f gasoline, its low amount in water produces odour and taste problems. Some studies on animal exposure have shown that M TBE is carcinogenic (An et al., 2002). Water contaminated w ith M TBE is not consumable by human beings because o f its unpleasant odour and taste. Although MTBE is considered as a potential health risk, there are little evidence or no evidence that MTBE causes cancer in human. Fortunately taste and odour o f MTBE in water at low levels are detectable by human (Jacobs et al., 2001).

Since M TBE dissolves easily in water and does not cling to soil, its movement in the ground is faster and farther than other components o f gasoline and, therefore, more likely

Degradation o f a compound in groundwater is its natural tendency to decrease its concentration during the time by chemical processes. These processes include either live organism activity like bacteria or non-biological processes. Because o f its chemical and physical characteristics, removal o f M TBE from groundwater is expensive, timeconsuming, and d ifficu lt (Jacobs et al., 2001). Ethers are compounds that are known resistant to biodégradation based-on the presence o f their ether bond (Fayolle et al., 2003). The presence o f t-butyl group in its molecular structure makes M TB E to be more defiant to natural biodégradation than other components o f gasoline. Two bio-recalcitrant functional groups in M TBE structure, ether lin k and branched structure, make MTBE resistant to biodégradation and have a low biomass yield (Fortin et al., 2001). Some authors classified M TBE as a recalcitrant compound, which is probably the result o f special bêhaviour o f carbon atom or/and ether structure (Jacobs et ah, 2001).

Removal o f M TBE from groundwater is very difficult because o f its relatively high solubility and its resistance to biodégradation. .Air stripping is a process in which contaminated water passes through a packed column and upward flow ing air removes the chemical compounds. Oxygen atom in the molecular structure o f M TB E provides hydrogen bonding between M TBE and water. The required energy for breaking this bond indicates why M TB E tends to remain in aqueous phase and not to transfer to vapour phase by air stripping. M TBE does not readily transfer from water to air and often needs high ratio o f air to water usually >200/1 for 95% removal (Safarzadeh-Amiri, 2001).

Vapours should not release directly in air and, therefore, need to be treated (Jacobs et ah, 2001). In treatment by granular activated carbon, contaminated water is pumped through a bed o f activated carbon. Since M TBE does not attach to carbon well, high volume o f contaminated water must pass through the granular activated carbon (GAC) system (EPA, 2003) as a result, it cannot be cost-effective.

Studies on the removal o f M TBE from groundwater indicate that: -Although M TBE can be metabolized by bacteria and produce CO 2 , the rate ol growth is slow (Jacobs et ah, 2001). -Application o f physical methods such as activated carbon or air stripping is
10

times

less cost-effective than application o f these methods in the removal o f hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene from groundwater (Jacobs et ah, 2001). -Although separation techniques are less expensive than oxidation processes, they only transfer the pollutant from one phase to another and they need an additional treatment step for degradation.

M TBE is a major part o f gasoline and is removed w ith difficulty, so an economical method o f treatment should be applied. Since bioremediation is usually applied for decomposition o f petroleum hydrocarbons, using a method that can be accompanied with biotreatment is appropriate (Barreto et ah, 1995). AO ? which applies a suitable combination o f U V , chemical oxidants and catalysts can oxidize a wide range o f organic compounds. Partial decomposition o f M TBE is a way for transition o f MTBE to

biodegradable products. Increasing use o f MTBE may lead to techniques like chemical oxidation integrated by biological degradation.

2.2. Principles of Advan ced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)
Oxidative procedure, which is applied for organic compounds in water, are generally referred to advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (Legrini et al. 1993). High rate o f pollution removal and large range o f applicability are two major advantages o f these technologies (Stefan et al., 1996). These processes, which are based on the generation o f very active and oxidizing free radicals, have received considerable attention because o f their high oxidant power (Benitez et al., 2001). In AOPs organic radicals are formed either by photolysis o f organic substrate or by reaction with hydroxyl radicals ( ' OH) (Legrini et al., 1993). The rate constant o f ' OH attack to organic compounds varies from 10^ to 10^ M '' s'". Abstraction o f hydrogen atom or addition to double bonds are the most possibility for *OH to oxidize organic substrates (Stefan et al., 1996). The products o f oxidation usually are readily degraded and have lower molecular weights. Theoretically, the combination o f ultraviolet light with an oxidant such as O3 and H 2 O2 results in complete mineralization o f organics to carbon dioxide and water. For wastewater treatment, UV/O 3 and U V /H 2 O2 are effectively used to degrade organic compounds (Bolduc and Anderson, 1997). Low-pressure mercury arcs wavelength are widely used in water treatment. Unlike medium-pressure lamps, which emit a large number o f lines in the range o f 200-400 nm, low-pressure lamps have only a single but strong line at 254 nm because the quartz used in their structures absorbs their 185-nm lines (Sonntag et al..

1993). The couplings o f UV light w ith different oxidants are discussed in the following sections.

2.2.1. UV/Hydrogen Peroxide Process
Single U V radiation may be used for removal o f pollutants from water but photochemical properties o f some substrates may be such that they cannot absorb light in the specific wavelengths. To enhance the degradation o f such compounds, hydrogen iroxide is used along UV process (Sonntag et al., T, Rate o f oxidation can be

accelerated by addition o f H 2 O2 to UV. Hydrogen peroxide can be decomposed to hydroxyl radicals in the presence o f UV light and initiate a chain reaction resulting in degradation o f organic pollutants (Clarke and Knowles, 1982). 'OH is one o f the most important oxidants because o f its high activity and non-selectivity towards organic compounds (Mitani et a!.,
2002

).

Capability o f its oxidation is defined by its potential oxidation (Clarke and Knowles, 1982):

'O H + H ^ + e ^ H 2 O

2.80 volts

(2.2)

Since H 2 O2 is a strong oxidant (standard potential 1.80 V and 0.87 V at pH 0 and 14, respectively), it can be a suitable option in the treatment o f various pollutants (Venkatadri and Peters, 1993). Photolysis o f H 2 O2 at wavelength o f < 400 nm includes the breakage

o f the molecule and formation o f two hydroxyl radicals per quantum o f radiation absorbed according to the following reaction:

- ^ 2 * OH

(2.3)

The production o f hydroxyl radicals from H 2 O2 needs sufficient energy (48.5 kcal.mole'') to break the 0 - 0 bond. The energy o f the short wavelength in UV-C lamps (with wavelengths o f 200-280 nm) is adequate for this breakage and leads to the formation o f radicals (Clarke and Knowles, 1982). H2 O2 is photoreactive at wavelength o f 185-400 nm. However, in the range o f wavelength 200-280 nm, it exhibits the highest yield o f hydroxyl radical production.

Higher pH can increase the rate o f hydrogen peroxide photolysis. Organic substrate reacts with these hydroxyl radicals to produce an organic radical ( ' RH).

' OH + H R H -^ ' RH + H^O

(2.4)

The reaction between the organic radical and dissolved oxygen produces organic peroxide radical (RHO 2 *), which entails thermal oxidation reactions. Generation o f organic cations, superoxide anions, carbonyl compounds and back reaction to * RH and O2 are the possible subsequent reactions for organic peroxide radicals. And finally, radical-radical recombination must be also taken into account.(Legrini et al., 1993).

(2 .5 )

Currently, technologies such as air stripping followed by activated carbon adsorption are less applied because they basically transfer contaminants from liquid phase to vapour or solid phase. Instead, the U V /H 2 O2 process can entirely oxidize the contaminants (Venkatadri and Peters, 1993). Advantages o f hydrogen peroxide make it a suitable choice as an oxidant in chemical or photochemical water treatment. The main advantages o f U V/H 2 O2 process are as follows; -Hydrogen peroxide is a commercially available oxidant, which has minimal capital investment. -It is thermally stable and infinitely soluble in water. -Each molecule o f H 2 O 2 produces two hydroxyl radicals; therefore, this oxidant is cost-effective source o f hydroxyl radicals.

The weak points o f the process include the absorption o f 'OH radicals by H 2 O2 and removal o f these radicals by bicarbonates. Because o f unfavourable reactions o f'O H with H 2 O2 and bicarbonates, H 2 O2 and pH should be optimized (Sonntag et al., 1993).

One suggested pathway for M TBE degradation by hydroxyl radicals is cited by Chang and Young, 2000;

2.2.2. Photocatalysis
. Photocatalysis is referred to the application o f U V-light to excite a semiconductor such as TiOz to catalyze the redox reaction with organic substrates in water (Bolduc and Anderson, 1997). TiO : is stable, insoluble, non-toxic, resistant to corr osion, and reusable (Aceituno et al., 2002). In a semiconductor, the energy difference between the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band is called band-gap. Thermal or photonic excitations can build a bridge and transfer electron from valance bad to conduction band. When TiOz is illuminated with photons ( h v ) of energy equal to or greater than its bandgap, electrons from the valance band ( VB) migrate to its conduction band ( C B ). The result o f this process is the creation o f photoholes (h"') in the valence band and free photoelectrons (e~) in the conduction band (Herrmann, 1999). Since the required energy to overcome the band-gap is 3.2 eV, only UV lights with wavelength o f 380 nm or less have the energy higher than the band-gap energy and can promote the electrons from valance band to conduction band (Dionysiou et al., 2000). The follow ing reactions take place in a semiconductor photocatalytic process (Venkatadri and Peters, 1993):

In an aqueous media, OH',

radicals ('OH) occurs when the holes are trapped by adsorbed hydroxide ions and the molecular water (Bolduc and Anderson, 1997; Venkatadri and Peters, 1993).

In the reductive part o f the reaction, oxidants such as oxygen scavenge the electrons and produce superoxide radicals (O 2 " ) . Oxygen molecule in water is an electron scavenger, as a result, its existence is essential to trap electrons and prevent recombination o f the holes with electrons.

Contaminates may also be attacked by O2 *` . Other radicals such as hydroperoxide radicals (HO 2 *) are also produced (Dionysiou et al., 2000). Another source o f hydroxyl radicals can be hydrogen peroxide, which is formed from superoxide ion. When the first

excitation reaction occurs, the holes and electrons may recombine and produce heat, which causes the photoefficiency o f the photocatalytic process reduce.

e~cB +h'^vB -- > heat

(2.14)

The advantage o f U V /T iO i process is its ability to completely mineralize wide range o f contaminants to CO 2 (Venkatadri and Peters, 1993). Moreover, it is stable in water in the entire range o f pH. TiOz is inexpensive and no additive is required. This process has the {possibility o f combination with other degradation methods such as biological treatment (Herrmann, 1999). Its disadvantages are the high operating cost as well as its low quantum yield ( < 0.05 ) (Bolduc and Anderson, 1997).

A photocatalytic mechanism for M TBE was suggested by Barreto et al. (Barreto et ah, 1995). The first step is the abstraction o f an a-hydrogen by OH and formation an organic radical leading to reaction with O2 and formation o f peroxy radical. This radical abstracts an a-hydrogen from MTBE molecule and forms an HperMTBE. Under acidic conditions the cleavage o f 0 - 0 bond in HperMTBE produces /er/-butyl formate (TBF).

while form ic acid can be photocatalytically oxidized to CO2 , in the presence o f hydrogen peroxide, TB A transforms to alkenes, which can be oxidized easily (Barreto et al., 1995).

2.2.3. Ozone/UV Process
Ozone (O3 ) may be used either directly with organic compounds or in combination with H 2 O 2 , which increases the oxidative capability by production o f hydroxyl radicals. Organic compounds which are resistant to ozonation can be degraded by photolytic ozonation. At present, the combination o f UV and O3 process seems to be the most commonly applied AOPs. Homolysis o f O 3 by U V light and production o f *0 H radicals by the reaction o f 0 ('D ) w ith water are two steps in Ozone/UV process as follows (Legrini et al., 1993);

Stefan et al. (2000) considered different pathways for above reactions that resulted in many different products, which are suggested in their study.

2.2.4. Fenton's Reagent
Fenton's reagent is a m ixture o f hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron. This process produces hydroxyl radicals as follows:

+ H 2 O 2 ->·

+ O H - + 'O H

(2.28)

Hydroxyl radicals can attack the organic compounds and degrade them. The optimum pH range for Fenton's reagent is 2-4 (Venkatadri and Peters, 1993). Colured organic compounds that have interference with U V light in U V /H 2 O 2 process can be degraded effectively by Fenton' s reagent.

The activity o f Fenton' s reagent can be enhanced by U V radiation. This is the result o f increased concentration o f hydroxyl radicals, which occurs by regeneration o f Fe^^ through photolysis o f Fe^^ complexes (Andreozzi et al., 1999):

In some cases irradiated reactions are reported 1.5-2.7 times faster than Fe^^/HzOz. Iron and H 2O2 concentrations, and pH value are important factors in Fenton and photoFenton reactions (Venkatadri and Peters, 1993).

Since the oxidation o f M TBE by Fenton' s reagent is mediated by the formation o f * OH, the same mechanism as o f the other AOPs is suggested for the formation o f TB A and TBF with this catalytic reaction (Xu et al., 2004).

2.2.5. Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) Process
When air (oxygen) absorbs radiation, the vacuum ultraviolet is a suitable choice in photooxidation. In this process, spectroscopic work at shorter wavelengths can only be performed in vacuum or in non-absorbing gases. In V U V process, H 2 O can be photolized to generate hydroxyl radicals, which can attack the organic substrate as following reaction:

H ^O

(2.30)

This process is very simple and no chemicals are added. Its application is limited in low concentrations o f contaminants. Xe excimer lamps can be applied for water photolysis (Legrini et al., 1993).

2.3. Biological Treatment of Organics in Water
Microorganisms have important role in water and wastewater treatment. The foundation of biological treatment is the relation between wastewater and

microorganisms because they can use organic compounds in wastewater as their nutrients. Environmental conditions such as presence o f oxygen, mineral nutrients, pH, and temperature should be suitable for the growth o f microorganisms to speed up the decomposition o f wastes. The main purpose o f most biological treatments is to decrease the organic loads in wastewater. Generally, biological treatments are divided in two groups: aerobic processes, in which microorganisms need oxygen fo r growth, and anaerobic processes, in which living organisms do their metabolisms in the absence o f oxygen (M etcalf and Eddy, 1991). The activated sludge is known as the most acceptable technology to remove biodegradable dissolved organic matters from wastewater. In activated sludge, wastewater is introduced into a suspended aerobic bacterial culture in a tank for several hours to use organic matters in wastewater as substrate and remove them by synthesis o f new bacterial cells. M ain units o f activated sludge processes are biological reactor equipped w ith aerator, clarifier, and recycle pumps fo r recycling o f the activated sludge (Reynolds and Richards, 1996). A mechanical or diffused aeration system supplies oxygen to provide aerobic condition as well as well-m ixed liquor in the tank. Microorganisms consume the organic pollutants and convert them to water and carbon dioxide while high amount o f microbes are synthesized. In the next step, the mixture is led to a settling tank. In the settling tank, living organisms, which usually have density higher than water, settle down and subsequently are separated from the treated

wastewater. A portion o f the activated sludge is returned to the treatment tank to remain the desired concentration o f microorganisms in the reactor (M etcalf and Eddy, 1991).

Biological reactors vary by geometry and hydraulic regime. Sequential Batch Reactors (SBR) is a single batch reactor with timed control sequence used for the removal o f undesirable components from wastewater. An SBR can be a simulation of any conventional activated sludge process (EPA, 1999). Unit processes o f SBR are the same as the conventional activated sludge systems, but unlike these systems in which the processes are carried out simultaneously in separate tanks, the functions o f SBR are carried out in a sequence o f time in the same tank, therefore, SBR is a time-oriented system. It operates based on fill-and-draw strategy. In a period o f time, influent enters the reactor containing acclimated biomass. The reactions complete in this batch reactor, the mixed liquor settles and clarified supernatant is removed from the reactor (Ir\'ine et al., 1989). In the SBR, there is no need for separate primary and secondary clarifiers. A typical SBR includes five discrete time periods: fill, react, settle, draw and idle.

In the fill period, the influent is added to the biomass, remained from previous cycle. This period is typically terminated when the desired volume o f tank is filled. Different strategies for fill period include static fill (no mixing-no aeration), mixed f ill (mixing-no aeration) and aerated fill (mixing-aeration).

D uring the react period, biological reactions initiated in fill period are completed. Low dissolved oxygen and high dissolved oxygen are conditions that can be provided by

23

mixed react and aerated react, respectively. Duration can range from 0 to more than 50% o f the total cycle.

Quiescent settlement o f solids takes place during settle period. The period should last fo r the time to ensure that sludge remains under the level o f withdrawal and does not rise.

Discharge o f treated effluent to the predetermined level takes place in draw period. The time in draw period typically'ranges from 5% to more than 30% o f the total cycle time.

The period between draw and fill periods in the next cycle is called idle, which can include sludge waste, i f necessary. Excess biomass is usually wasted to maintain the ratio o f substrate in influent to biomass constant (Irvine and Ketchum, 1989) so the need for recycling activated sludge is eliminated. To achieve specific treatment purposes, some modifications may be made in the performances and times with each step. To meet the desired effluent quality, the number o f cycles per day can be varied.

2.4. Combination of Advanced Oxidation Processes and Biological Treatment
Effluents from different industries are mostly not biodegradable and sometimes resistant to conventional methods o f treatment. Although AOPs are usually effective for mineralization o f resistant organic compounds in water and wastewater, their energy consumption is higher than that o f biological processes. Advanced oxidation processes

24

are expensive technologies with high capital and operating costs while these costs in biological processes are 5-20 and 3-10 times lower (Marco et al., 1997). Conventional biological treatment methods, such as activated sludge, are less expensive and less successful in destruction o f resistant compounds. Potential applications for two-step treatments rather than single processes are suggested. Recalcitrant compounds are wastewater contaminates that can benefit from integrated processes. Pre-treatment o f toxic or resistant organic compounds by AOPs may lead to improve their

biodegradability and result in the production o f intermediates, which can be consumed more easily by microorganisms, so further mineralization by AOPs is not economically justified. Partial oxidation o f persistent compounds can be substituted for total oxidation with much less costs in biological treatment. Combination o f chemical and biological processes is a successful system, which is less expensive method for treatment o f resistant compounds, and therefore, is a good option for complete degradation o f organic compounds. A successful biological treatment w ill remove the remaining organic matter. This combination o f chemical and biological processes seems to be most recommendable for the treatment o f resistant pollutants in water and wastewater.

2.5. Examples of Applications of Different AOPs for Degradation of Organic Compounds
Previous studies on the removal o f organic compounds from water and wastewater by AOPs have considered different aspects. The removal o f azo-reactive dyes from textile wastewater by applying UV in the presence o f H 2 O2 was studied (Georgiou et al., 2002). Experimental results showed that without H 2 O2 , no colour removal occurred, but

25

addition o f even a small amount o f H 2 O2 resulted in a complete destruction o f colour in all cases. In the presence o f H 2 O 2 , 90% removal o f intermediates (containing aromatic rings) and more than 80% removal o f TOC were observed. Obtained results demonstrated that during the degradation, dye solution became acidic (pH = 3-3.5). The increasing chemical oxygen demand (COD) at the beginning o f irradiation was the result of dye molecules destruction to simpler and less resisted compounds.

In another study, aniline, p-toluidine and 2,4-xylidine were chosen as model compounds to investigate the photooxidation o f aromatic compounds in both forms o f slurry and immobilized TiOz (Preis et al., 2002). The experimental results showed that: -Increasing in pH between 7-11 resulted in increase reaction rate. -Higher concentration o f pollutants resulted in decrease photooxidation efficiency. -The activity o f T i 0 2 was lower in immobilized form than that in slurry one.

Ince (1999) studied the kinetics o f dyeing stuff degradation by AOPs. The obtained results showed an increase in the degradation with increasing H 2 O 2 up to the approximately ratio o f 14 HzOi/dye. Above this value, inhibition o f degradation was obseiwed. This inhibition can be explained by the competition o f U V absorbance by dye and H 2 O 2 . A first order kinetic was assumed for the degradation and a model was defined based on the competitive inhibition. Proposed model predicted the same ratio as the optimum dose o f H 2 O2 .

Degradation o f several strongly coloured compounds (raethylen blue, Rhodamine B, methyl orange and salicylic acid) was studied in presence o f TiO^ in a flat bed reactor illuminated by sunlight and a medium-pressure mercury lamp (Matthews, 1991). The results showed that TiOz and U V light had essential roles in the degradation o f the coloured compounds. In the absence o f the photocatalyst, even in the presence o f H 2 O2 the photodegradation was only 40% greater than that o f the removal rate by dark reaction with TiOz- The presence o f TiOz resulted in 5 times faster removal rate while the presence o f H 2 O2 resulted in 2.5 times faster rate. It was observed that generally an increase o f flow rate resulted in an increase o f removal rate and also a decrease o f initial concentration resulted in an increase o f apparent rate constant. For each experiment, the degradation by sunlight was greater than that by artificial light, due to greater avoidable energy fo r catalyst activation.

Hofstadlert and Bauer (1994) studied the degradation o f 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by UV/TiOz immobilized on fused-silica glass fibres. The results showed that between
10

-

60°C the rate o f decomposition o f 4-CP was increased linearly. Use o f light with shorter wavelength (280-320 nm) resulted in higher oxidation rate o f 4-CP but not o f TOC, which meant higher resistant against oxidation to CO2 by products than that o f 4-CP. The results fo r both immobilized and suspended TiOz were the same. Degradation rate was increased by HzOz addition, but for TOC, the rates were equal. Decreasing pH from 5.8 to 3.5 enhanced the degradation o f 4-CP and TOC.

2.6. Previous Studies on MTBE Degradation
The potential for removal o f MTBE by AOPs has been the subject o f only limited research. To date, only a few studies have been conducted for investigation o f the effects o f AOPs on M TBE degradation.

W ith considering environmental concerns about MTBE, Stefan et ai. (2000) studied aqueous solution o f MTBE and 'U products resulting from its degradation by UV/H 2O2 (Stefan et al., 2000). They suggested the details o f the mechanism o f a pseudo first-order reaction resulting in complete mineralization o f all initial organic compounds or organics produced during the treatment process. The by-products o f the irradiation were detected and quantified. The generation o f /er/-butyl formate (TBF), 2-methoxy-2-methyl propionaldéhyde (M M P), formaldehyde, acetone, /er/-butyl alcohol (TBA), methyl acetate, hydroxy-iso-butyraldehyde, hydroxyacetone, pyruvaldehyde, hydroxy-iso-butyric acid, formic acid, pyruvic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid was confirmed.

The possibility o f the application o f UV/H 2 O 2 as a method o f treatment for waters polluted by MTBE to quantify the kinetics o f MTBE degradation and the kinetics of the formation and destruction o f the by-products was studied (Chang and Young, 2000). For the reaction with hydroxyl radicals, a second-order rate constant o f 3.9x 10^ M ''s' for M TBE and 1.2x 10^ M 's"' for TBF as a by-product o f M TBE degradation by UV/H 2 O2 was studied.

The removal o f MTBE by O 3 and O3 /H 2 O2 , in which the production o f ' OH was the driving force, was studied (M itani et al., 2002). The kinetics o f M TBE oxidation and its intermediates were studied. In a range o f 21-45"C the second-order rate constant for reaction o f MTBE with O3 and o f MTBE with ' OH, resulted in the O 3 /H 2 O2 process, was measured to be 1.4x 10`* exp (-95.4/RT) and 8.0x 10^ exp(-4.6/RT) M"' s'% respectively. It was indicated that in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), the addition o f H 2 O2 to O3 resulted in an increase o f the rate and degree o f MTBE degradation, t-butyl formate (TBF), t-butyl alcohol (TBA), methyl acetate, and acetone were determined as products o f the reactions o f O 3 and O 3/H 2 O2 with MTBE.

Kinetics and oxidation efficiency o f MTBE by O3/H 2O2 was examined (SafarzadehA m iri, 2001). That study was performed in two phases including M TBE concentrations greater and lower than 10 mg/L. Ozone mass transfer was a lim iting factor in the rate o f oxidation o f MTBE, specially in the first phase. Depending on the ozone gas flow rate, the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant varied from

study, an efficiency index for comparison o f MTBE oxidation in different water was defined.

The feasibility o f photocatalytic process for the mineralization o f MTBE was investigated and a first-order reaction constant for its degradation in the presence of UV light in T i 0 2 slurry was suggested (Barreto et al., 1995). The by-products o f the reaction were identified and the reaction scheme in which MTBE was changed to harmless compounds was proposed. The primary by-products were t-butyl formate (TBF) and t-

2.7. Previous Studies on the Combination of Advanced Oxidation and Biological Processes
The possibility o f combination- o f photochemical and biological treatment has been studied by many researchers and its beneficial effects were reported (Bankian Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). Some o f these studies are summarized here:

Experiments were performed to compare the treatment o f domestic wastewater by activated sludge and by combined chemical-biological processes (Beltran et al., 1999a). The biological pre-treatment partially removed the compounds in wastewater and reduced the competition for ozonation in the next step. The performance o f biological step could control the efficiency o f the chemical step. After a biological treatment, a post-ozonation process improved the reduction o f dissolved organic matters. The ozonation changed the structure o f chemicals and resulted in the formation o f more biodegradable products and, therefore, increased the ratio o f BOD/COD, which meant the improvement o f biodegradability in the system. This effluent could be easily treated in natural water systems. They also reversed the sequence o f oxidation and observed that pre-ozonation could improve the biodégradation expressed as BOD/COD ratio and remove recalcitrant organics by changing the molecular structure o f oxygenated products that were more readily to biodegradable (Beltran et al., 1999b). While single activated sludge resulted in

80% and 47% removal o f BOD and chemical oxygen demand (COD), combined system could have
88

% and

66

% removal o f BOD and COD, respectively. From the results o f

these two studies, it was concluded that combined processes were more effective than single biological or chemical treatment and the best sequence was found to be the ozonation followed by biological treatment.

To minimize the use o f expensive chemical oxidants, experiments were performed in a cycle o f consecutive biological and ozonation process (Karrer et al., 1997). After ozonation, an increase o f BOD in biologically pre-treated wastewater was observed. To have as much as possible work for biotreatment, it was suggested that ozonation process to be stopped at the highest level o f BOD and leave the removal o f biodegradable compounds to biotreatment. The new oxidation step would be started afterward. It was observed that the consumption o f ozone in an exclusive ozonation was more than combined treatment and it was concluded that although there would be a few oxidation products, which react with ozone and were biodegradable, majority o f ozonation products had very slow reaction with ozone.

The effectiveness o f different AOPs for decomposition o f THMs was studied (Ito et al., 1998). It was suggested that the highest degradation rate in O3 /H 2 O2 /U V was the result o f higher generation rate o f hydroxyl radicals compared to H 2 O2/U V and H 2 O2/O 3 processes. While single ozonation increased the biodegradability, it was not effective on mineralization. On the other hand, AOPs enhanced both mineralization and

biodegradability. Further AOPs resulted in a complete degradation o f biodegradable compounds.

A study was conducted for the comparison o f the application o f various AOPs before biodégradation o f a textile wastewater (Ledakowicz and Gonera, 1999). The results showed that O3 AJV or O3/U V /H 2 O2 could be the most advisable process. The pretreatment textile wastewater showed less inhibitory on microbial growth in further biological step than non-treated one. Meanwhile, the concentration o f H 2 O2 was determined, which did not have any detrimental effect on microorganisms.

The development o f an advanced treatment process for textile dye wastewater was reported (L i and Zhao, 1999). Dye wastewater was treated by an intermittently decanted extended aeration (ID EA) reactor for biological treatment, passed through a sand filter to polish residual biomass and suspended solid and then followed toward T i 0 2

photocatalytic reactor for complete decolourisation and high COD removal. Both the batch and continuous modes in the photoreactor were studied. The results after biological treatment showed 92.3% and 73.3% BOD removal in reactive dye and acid dye, respectively. But only 44.7% and 68.1% o f COD removal were reported. In the batch mode, the concentration o f T i 0 2 in the photoreactor was I-IO g/L while the concentration o f T i 0 2 increased; the time for required decolourisation was decreased. The colour was removed completely in a shorter period o f time than what was required fo r COD reduction. In the continuous mode, increasing the flow rate resulted in decreasing COD and colour removal. The reaction efficiency in batch operation was higher than that in

32

continuous mode. The treated wastewater in this reactor could satisfy the requirements o f the water suitable for reusing in textile dye processes.

The removal o f three different commercial dyes in a combined photoreactor system was investigated (L i and Zhao, 1997). The pollutants were in itia lly treated in an IDEA followed by a photocatalytic reactor. A re-circulating batch plate-type photocatalytic reactor was used and TiOz was immobilized on the natural zeolite. Experiments were conducted in 4 phases include` biological reactor alone, photocatalytic reactor alone, photobioreactor without re-circulation, and by photobioreactor w ith re-circulation. In the first phase, the treatment o f all kinds o f dyeing wastewater used in the experiment was not achieved. The second phase showed complete COD removal in wastewater samples (over 90%), but in a very long period o f time (200-250 hours). The results in photobioreactor system without re-circulation demonstrated that the amount o f TiOz on zeolite and light intensity affected the rate o f decolourisation significantly. In comparison to the second phase, the time o f the reaction was shortened to 20% in the third phase. In this case, BOD was increased w hile COD was decreased, which indicated the existence o f some simpler organic compounds

Experiments were performed to investigate the effects o f UV radiation, UV/HzOz, Fe^^/HzOz (Fenton reaction), and UV/Fe^^/HzOz (photo-Fenton reaction) on the treatment o f wastewater from olive industry (Benitez et al., 2001). Production o f hydroxyl radical, which occurred through UV/HzOz, Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions, enhanced the degradation rate in comparison to single UV reaction. An anaerobic digestion fo r this

wastewater was also studied and the constant values o f a modified Monod model were estimated. It was observed that pre-treatment o f wastewater from olive industry by chemical processes improved the rate o f digestion in the follow ing anaerobic stage.

Since M TB E is known as a recalcitrant compound, no study has been found about the application o f a combined system for its removal, but recent studies have shown that different bacterial cultures have the capability o f M TB E degradation.

The possibility o f M T B E degradation by using a BC-1 culture was examined (Salanitro et al., 1994). This mixed bacterial culture, which was derived from an industrial chemical biotreater, could degrade M TBE up to 200 mg/L. In a continuous cell recycle unit, low rate o f microorganisms growth was observed. In batch removal experiments, M T B E was degraded much faster and produced TE A . The rate o f TBA degradation was lower than that o f M TBE and the highest rate was when all M TBE was consumed. Generally, this study showed that M TBE could be biodegraded in high extent by BC-1 but growth rate and cellular yield were low. The low rate could be the result o f lim iting intermediates or M T B E activity as a metabolic inhibitor.

A metabolism fo r biodégradation o f M TBE by mycobacterium austroafricanura IFF 2012 in which the intermediates were identified was suggested (Fayolle et al., 2003). The growth o f this bacteria included a long lag phase corresponding to the conversion for M TBE to TB A and a rapid growth on produced TB A . The effect o f the competition between M TBE and T B A fo r the same enzymatic activity was examined and it was

concluded that the competition was not the reason o f M TBE slow degradation, but probably the T B A hydrolysis was inhibitor in M TBE biodégradation.

The potential o f M TBE for biodégradation was examined (Kane et al., 2001). For this purpose, microcosms containing aquifer sediment and ground water from leaking underground storage tanks were used. In the best case, after a 4-day lag period, 4.5 mg/L M TBE was biodegraded w ithin 15 days and 43-54% o f it was converted to CO 2 . P M l was the responsible bacteria strain for this process. The effects o f water soluble components o f gasoline on M TBE degradation were investigated and it was observed that the presence o f dissolved compounds did not necessarily decrease the degradation o f M TBE and TBA.

Strain IFP 2007, which was isolated from a sampled activated sludge o f a wastewater treatment plant, was used in a study (Hernandez et al., 2001). This study compared the consumption o f M TBE as a source o f carbon in presence and absence o f other carbon sources such as ethanol and it was shown that while sole M TBE was not consumed, it had a cometabolic degradation with ethanol.

The possibility o f biodégradation o f M TBE and TB A by bed-sediment microbial communities was also studied (Bradley et al., 1999). It was observed that these microorganisms were capable to convert 73% M TBE and 84% T B A to CO 2 in a mixed aerobic/anaerobic conditions. Under completely anaerobic conditions, no mineralization was observed.

35

The consumption o f M TB E as a sole carbon source by pure bacterial cultures isolated from activated sludge was investigated (Mo et al., 1997). A fter the first week o f incubation on 200 ppm M TBE,
8

% o f M TBE was converted to CO 2 and after 2 weeks

28% degradation was observed. The initial fast degradation rate was followed by a slower rate. The applied bacteria strain could also grow on TBF. The presence o f other organic compounds such as TBF and TB A decreased the bacterial growth on M TBE. When MTBE was consumed as a .c ; carbon source, the low growth rate led the researchers to

conclude that M T B E was a poor energy source. In their study, greater capability o f mixed culture than that o f pure culture for degradation o f MTBE was observed.

The feasibility o f several propane-oxidizing bacteria was tested for growth on MTBE (Steffan et al., 1997). A fter growth on propane, the strain was able to mineralize more than 60% o f M T B E with 20 mg/L initial concentration in less than 30 hours. The pathway o f degradation was proposed and T B A as a first measurable degradation product o f M T B E was determined. Production o f T B A led to the presence o f formaldehyde, which was further oxidized to formate and CO 2 .

The possibility o f M TBE biodégradation in the presence o f alkanes was studied (Gamier et al., 1999). For this purpose, the metabolization kinetics o f M TB E by a bacteria strain, isolated from soil consortium, in the presence o f pentane as a source o f carbon and energy was studied. W ith conducted experiments, the parameters o f suggested model fo r this biodégradation was identified. The maximum growth rate and specific

36

degradation rate o f pentane was about 0.19 h"' and 105 mg h'' gdry biom ass- This study indicated that M TB E could be cometabolized in the presence o f pentane, but no degradation was observed in its absence. In the presence o f pentane, in the first 30 hours, only pentane was degraded and M TBE concentration did not change. Between 30 and 50 hours the maximum M TBE degradation was occurred. A fter 60 hours, pentane was completely consumed and M TBE degradation rate became low. Overall, 20%

mineralization o f M TBE was observed during this time. Investigation on the effect o f various amounts o f pentane showed that the increase o f this carbon source could result in the increase o f M TB E degradation, so for M TBE degradation a model was suggested in which the main parameters were initial concentrations o f pentane and o f MTBE. Up to 900 m g/L M TBE had no inhibitory effect on bacteria growth.

The bioremediation potential o f M TBE was investigated by using aerobic microcosm o f Borden aquifer materials (Schirmer et al., 1999). A psuedo first-order reaction for M T B E degradation was considered and its constant rate was found to be 0.0012 day'*. It was concluded that M TBE was quite rare to be selected as a primary substrate. Although it can be biodegraded by natural microbial populations at Borden, the rate o f the degradation o f M TB E was much slower than that o f usual gasoline contaminants.

The capability o f a microbial consortium cultivated in a liquid system, which was originated from MTBE-contaminated sites and enriched in biotrickling filters was investigated (Fortin et al., 2001). It was found that biodégradation o f MTBE in concentrations, as much as 1G O mg/L or less, followed a zero-order reaction w ith rate

During 80 hours, 79% o f MTBE converted to CO 2 . The possibility o f production o f more biomass by supplementing the culture w ith diethyl ether as an alternative carbon source was studied. M TBE was only biodegraded after complete consumption o f diethyl ether and an increase o f biomass concentration equal to

primary M TBE degraders. Comparison between energy wasted during bacterial growth on MTBE and that o f TB A suggested that large energy expenditure v.-ss related to the breakage o f ether bond in M TBE, but still losses o f energy occurred after the initial step o f M TBE degradation to TB A .

CHAPTER 3 EXPERIMENTAL WORK

3.1. Photochemical Treatment
3.1.1. Photochemical Experimental Set-up
Figure 3.1 shows the photorejictor used for all photochemical experiments. A total volume o f 3 L deionized water was used in the batch photoreactor in each experiment. The reactor was immersed in a cylindrical PVC container with a volume o f 7 L. The water in the container was fed by tap water continuously to keep the temperature of the solution constant within 15-20°C. This container was also used as a shield to prevent the transmission o f light from the reactor. Two different Philips U V lamps with wavelength 365 nm (PL-S 9W/10) or 254 nm (PL-S 9W TU V) were used. In each experiment, a lamp, located on a support, was immersed into the solution at the centre o f the reactor. Hydrogen peroxide and/or TiO ; were added to the aqueous solution. A magnetic stirrer bar was used to mix and unify the solution and to avoid any mass transfer limitation.

3.1.2. Chemical Degradation Experiments
In order to explain the role o f H 2 O2 , TiÛ 2 , and UV light in the oxidation o f MTBE, a series o f experiments were conducted. A typical degradation experiment included 3 L test solution containing M TBE and deionized water in the presence and absence o f H2 O2 and/or T i 0 2 . The M TBE concentration was used at 2-30 mg/L. The influence o f T i 0 2 and H 2 O2 concentrations on the degradation o f MTBE were studied. Powdered T iÛ 2 and/or

50% H 2 O 2 solution were then added and stirred w ith a Teflon-coated magnetic bar under light and the temperature was kept constant at 15-20°C during the reaction time. The mixing system also provided sufficient oxygen for the reactions. Samples were withdrawn at time intervals o f 1 h and immediately analyzed. Samples from photocatalytic reactions were centrifuged by an ADAM S centrifuge for 30 minutes and supernatant was used for gas chromatography (GC) analyses.

The parameter that was measured to control the degradation rate o f M TBE under different conditions included MTBE residue (Appendix B). In addition, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were estimated.

Temperature and pH were also other monitored parameters. Each experiment was conducted in three separate runs and the average o f obtained results for the same intervals SD o f time reaction were shown. Commonly, the value o f -- f = , in which SD is the standard

deviation and n is the number o f samples, was used as the value o f error bars or standard error o f the mean. Between +1 and -1 standard error was the range in which there was
68

% probability that the true mean value was measured. For more strong probability, the

limits were extended to +2 and -2 times the standard error and, therefore, provided 95% confidence. Since the numbers o f samples were 3, the standard errors with 95% confidence are:

en ± 2 x ^ « 5 'D V3

Therefore, the error bars in graphs are equal to standard deviations. Because o f different analytical and sampling errors, different values o f error bars were observed.

3.2. Biological Treatment
3.2.1. Biodegradability of MTBE and Intermediates
To assess the biodegradability o f MTBE and its intermediates, a series o f BOD tests were conducted. BOD laboratory tests utilize living organisms to determine the effect o f conditions to which organisms are exposed. The performance o f these tests was under controlled environmental conditions and duration (Section 3.5.7). In these tests, oxygen consumption o f polyseed microorganisms in the presence o f MTBE and intermediates was performed. The greater dissolved oxygen consumption corresponded to more microbial growth and activity.

3.2.2. Study o f Biological Treatment
Knowledge o f the rate o f bioreactions is a requirement for the design o f biological degradation. A study was conducted in aerobic processes to provide rate constants. Batch reactors were set to perform the biodégradation o f MTBE in three different approaches: Experiment 1 was used to test the ultimate BOD for MTBE in water. Experiment 2 was used to examine the possibility o f a mixed culture for MTBE biodégradation. Experiment 3 was used fo r a survey, investigating the potential for acclimation o f a mixed culture to degrade MTBE.

3.2.2.1. Biological Experimental Set-Up for Determination of Ultimate BOD
The procedure for ultimate BOD (BODu) test was the same as BOD 5 (Section 3.5.7), except it had some specific requirements and differences in applications which is explained as follows: BOD bottles containing MTBE concentrations o f 5, 10, 30, and 50 mg/L along with polyseed solution (Section 3.5.7.1) and dilution water, as described in BOD 5 tests (Section 3.5.7), were prepared and placed in an incubator at 20°C, dissolved oxygen (DO) was monitored frequently to ensure that low dissolved oxygen or anaerobic condition did not dominate. Whenever DO concentration was less than 2 mg/L, the sample was reaerated by bubbling with air and the concentration o f DO after aeration became the initial DO for next reading. DO measurement was extended until consumption o f DO in a week became 1-2% below the total consumption (Standard Methods for the Examination o f Water and Wastewater, 1998).

3.2.2.2. Biological Experimental Set-Up for Biodégradation o f MTBE by Mixed Culture
Biodégradation o f M TBE by mixed culture was carried out in a 1500 ml flask. Microorganisms obtained from activated sludge unit o f municipal wastewater treatment plant o f North Toronto, located in the Don Valley, were added with 480 mg/L concentration o f mixed liquor volatile suspended solid (MLVSS) (Section 3.5.8) into the flask containing 30 mg/L solution o f MTBE. 0.5 ml o f each Phosphate buffer, magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride, and ferric chloride were used as nutrients in amounts to be consistent with the ratio o f BOD: N: P equal to 100: 5: 1 (Eckenfelder,

2000). To avoid the lack o f nutrients, the same amounts (0.5 ml o f each solution) were added weekly. The flask was sealed with cotton ball and incubated in a New Brunswick scientific C25KC shaker incubator at 20°C and shaking at 150 rpm. Another flask operating in the same conditions and containing the same mixed solution except sludge was considered as blank to quantify the disappearance o f M TBE by volatilization. During 30 days o f experiment, less than 5% o f initial M TBE disappeared in this blank flask, which was not remarkable. A t various times, samples o f the culture were filtered for substrate determination and further analysis.

The characteristics o f wastewater were monitored by measuring DO, pH, COD, and MTBE concentration. Because o f the very low biomass yield o f MTBE, the increase o f MLVSS during bacterial growth compared to the initial MLVSS was very negligible and could not be measured with present analytical balance in the laboratory, therefore, this parameter could not be monitored. In addition, small volume o f reactor was a limiting factor for measuring BOD; in this process because for each BOD; test, more than 200 ml o f solution was necessary, so this parameter was not monitored as well. The aeration was controlled by DO, which was in the range o f 6.5 to 7.7 mg/L

3.2.2.3. Biological Experimental Set-up for Biodégradation of MTBE by Acclimated Microorganisms
To acclimate the microorganisms, obtained from activated sludge unit o f municipal wastewater treatment plant o f North Toronto, a 7-L sequential batch reactor (SBR) was used and operated at room temperature, which was 2 5 + 1°C (Figure 3.2). The operation

o f SBR in these series o f experiments is explained in details in Section 3.2.2.3.2. A stone air-diffuser aerated the culture through a tube through which air was flowing gently to avoid M TBE stripping. To ensure no disappearance o f M TBE was occurred due to the aeration, the loss o f M TBE was determined with different flo w rates o f air and the appropriate one was set for the reactor. A mechanical paddle stirrer w ith rotating speed o f 350-400 rpm, which was measured by Tachometer (DT-105 A , Electronic Equipment Co., Inc.), distributed the sludge and materials in the reactor evenly.

3.2.2.3.I. Microorganisms Acclimation Experiments
Acclimatization is the physiological and behavioural adjustments o f microorganisms to changes in its environment (EPA, 1999). The acclimation process was applied to maximize the efficiency o f biodégradation o f bioresistant compounds. In this process

over a period o f time, increasing concentration o f the compound o f interest was introduced as feed to microorganisms and makes them to gradually utilize the compound as a carbon source (Scott and Ollis, 1995). As MTBE is not known as a readily used carbon source by microorganisms, a previous process o f acclimatization was necessary to be carried out.

To achieve the endpoint concentration o f 30 mg/L MTBE for acclimation procedure, the bioreactor was prim arily filled w ith 7 L synthetic wastewater containing 10 mg/L M TBE and 5 mg/L sodium acetate as carbon sources, which had BOD 5 o f 4 mg/L. To ensure adequate nutrients for microorganisms, the ratio o f BOD; N: P equal to 100: 5: 1 was provided in the solution by addition o f 3 ml phosphate buffer with supplementary

nutrients including 1.5 m l o f each magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride, and ferric chloride. The same amounts o f these nutrients were added whenever the wastewater was refreshed until the end o f the acclimatization period. For microbial growth in the solution, it was inoculated with activated sludge. Microbial growth was tracked by the measurement o f MLVSS (Section 3.5.8). The bioreactor operated at room temperature, which was 25+ 1°C. To ensure the adequate aeration in the bioreactor, DO was daily monitored v/hich was in the range o f 7.15 to
8

mg/L and confirmed the presence o f

aerobic condition in the SBR. To acclimatize the microorganisms to M TBE, a feeding strategy was applied by which the introduction o f increasing concentrations o f this substrate to the reactor was defined during acclimation period. In this way, 10 mg/L o f M TBE and 5 m g/L o f sodium acetate were introduced to SBR in the first day and as acclimation proceeded, the concentration o f MTBE was increased 1 mg/L and o f sodium acetate was decreased 0.25 mg/L per successive additions (Figure 3.3). Steady state was assumed to be achieved when the M TBE concentration in the bioreactor became constant and close to zero. A t the time, new mixture o f M TBE and sodium acetate was added and samples were taken for measurement o f BOD 5 . This process was continued until the concentration o f M TBE and sodium acetate in the feed reached to 30 and 0 mg/L, respectively. This process took more than 50 days. The acclimatization was finally attained when removals o f M TBE with initial concentration o f 30 mg/I^ in different conducted experiments were similar.

3.2.23.2. Biodégradation Experiments A fter the acclimation phase, the feasibility o f the remained biomass for biodégradation o f M TBE was investigated. For this purpose, the 7-L batch reactor was applied as a sequential batch reactor (SBR). Following a 10-h settlement, the remaining solution in the bioreactor was removed. To compensate the discharge o f nutrients w ith discharge o f supernatant, phosphate buffer, magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride, and ferric chloride were added to fresh M TBE solution to supply the suggested ratio o f BOD: N: P. A filland-draw cycle was considered at room temperature. A complete cycle began w ith a 6 -h aerated fill period, in which fresh M TBE solution w ith concentration o f 30 mg/L and nutrients were introduced to the bioreactor, and followed by a 65-h react period including aeration and mixing. The amount o f M TBE was determined in specific time intervals o f 10-15 hours. This period lasted until the desired concentration o f M TBE was achieved. To avoid biomass losses, 7 hours was dedicated to the settle period without any aeration or mixing. A clear supernatant was obtained after this period, which was the treated effluent. The process continued by 3.5-h draw period with no aeration and mixing, in which the treated effluent was removed from the reactor. The cycle ended by idle phase o f 3.5 hours without any m ixing and aeration. M TBE, MLVSS, DO, BOD, COD and pH were the parameters obtained to evaluate the performance o f the process. The trend o f degradation o f M TBE during this process is shown in Figure 4.31.

3.3. Combination of Photocatalytic and Biological Processes for the Degradation of MTBE in Water
The removal o f M TBE was performed by the combined processes o f photochemical and biological treatment. The decomposition o f M TBE was carried out by photocatalytic reaction as a pre-treatment followed by biodégradation. For this purpose, the effluent obtained from photoreactor was introduced into the biological reactor.

Initial concentration o f 50 mg/L M TBE and 1.5 g/L TiOz were introduced to the photoreactor. Experiments were conducted in the same way that has been described

before (Section 3.1.2) for a 1.5-h period o f time. In a sim ilar way to that for the sir gle biological process (Section 3.2.2.3.2), the supernatant o f centrifuged pre-treated solution was fed into the SBR, which was the final M TB E concentration in photoreactor and its initial concentration in biological experiments (Figure 3.4).

3.4. Materials and Analytical Techniques

3.5. Analytical Techniques
3.5.1. Determination o f MTBE Concentration
M T B A concentrations were analyzed by GC with conditions as follows: MTBE was transferred from 10 m l aqueous samples to the vapour phase by bubbling an inert gas, He, for 11 min through the aqueous samples contained in purging chamber o f a Tekmar 2016 purge and trap autosampler at ambient temperature. After completion o f purging, the trap was heated and the compound was desorbed and transferred into a D B -W A X column (30mX0.25mmX 0.5pm) in a Perkin Elmer Autosystem X L, which was equipped with flame ionization detector. Both the injector and detector temperatures were set at 300°C. The temperature o f the oven was set at 45°C and remained constant for 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas w ith the flow rate o f 1-2 m l/min. The retention time for MTBE was at 2.73 min (Figure 3.5).

3.5.2. pH
Buffer solutions w ith pH 4 and 7 were used each day to calibrate the pH meter before the beginning o f experiments because they bracketed the expected sample range. pH was monitored w ith a Thermo Orion model 23 OA plus.

3.5.3. H 2 O2
H 2 O2 in the range o f 2-500 [aM was determined by 2,9-dimethyI-l,10-phenantroline (DMP) method (Kosaka et al., 1998). Different standard solutions o f H 2 O2 were prepared by addition o f its desired amount to distilled water. By dissolving o f 1 g DMP in 100 ml ethanol, DMP reagent was made and stored in a brown bottle at 4°C. By dissolving copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate in water, a 0.01 M copper (II) sulphate solution was prepared. 13.5 g K2HPO4 and 12 g NaH 2 P0 4 were added to water to make 0.1 M phosphate buffer and then its pH \vas adjusted to 7.0 by H2SO4 1 N and NaOH 1 N. In a 10-ml volumetric flask, 1 ml each o f DMP, copper (II) sulphate, phosphate buffer and 3 ml o f desired standard solution o f hydrogen peroxide was added. Flask was filled up with distilled water and solution was mixed. Blank solution contained 1 ml DMP reagent, 1 ml copper (II) sulphate, and 1 ml phosphate buffer and was filled up with distilled water. By comparing the absorbance o f blank and standards at 454 nm in a Biochrom spectrophotometer model Ultrospec 1lOOpro a calibration curve was obtained, which was used further for determination o f H 2 O2 in samples (Figure 3.6).

3.5.4. H 2 O2 Removal
To stop the reaction by hydrogen peroxide and to remove its detrimental effect on microbial culture, H 2 O2 had to be decomposed by catalase. In this experiment, the used catalase with molecular weight o f 250,000 was bovine liver type and was purchased from SIGMA Company. H 2 O2 with 200 mg/L concentration was removed by addition o f 2.5 unit o f catalase per m l o f solution. Each mg o f catalase was equivalent to 2380 units. The solution was kept for
2

hours without mixing and the concentration o f H 2 O2 was

measured to ensure its complete removal (Ito et al., 1998).

3.5.5. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
To measure the oxygen equivalent to the organic matter content o f a sample, COD tests were used. In this method, organics were oxidized by KzCr^O? in acidic condition, which was provided by sulphuric acid in fo llo w reaction:

C,,H^O^N^ + dCr^O:^^ + (Sd + c )H *

nCO^ + {a + S d ~ 3c) / 2 H ^ 0 + cN H^ + 2dCr^^ (3.1)

Where d = 2n/3 + a/ 6 - b/3 - c/2. Usually 0.25 N solution o f potassium dichromate is used for COD determination, although for samples with COD below 50 mg/L a lower concentration o f potassium dichromate is preferred. In this experiment, 2.5 ml o f sample solution was added into COD vials contained sulphuric acid, potassium dichromate, silver sulphate (catalyst), mercuric sulphate and sulphamic acid. After screwing the cap, vials were placed in the heater block o f an Accu-TEST COD reactor (BioScience, Inc.) at 150"C for 2 h. Then, unopened vial was put into the light path o f a Biochrom spectrophotometer model Ultrospec llOOpro, which was set at 600 nm. The absorbance was measured and compared to the calibration curve and corresponding amount o f COD was reported in mg/L (Figure 3.7). Standard solution had been prepared by dissolving o f 425 mg o f potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) in 1000 m l distilled water, which had a theoretical COD o f 500 mg/L O2 . Different concentrations for standard solutions were prepared by dilution o f this solution (Standard methods for the examination o f water and wastewater, 1998).

3.5.6. Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
Dissolved oxygen was measured by a YSI dissolved oxygen meter model 58 equipped with a YSI 5739 field probe. Each day before the beginning o f experiments, DO meter was adjusted to obtain a meter reading corresponding to the calibration value for the local altitude.

3.5.7. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
BOD tests were performed according to the Standard Methods for the Examination o f Water and Wastewater (Standard Methods for the Examination o f Water and Wastewater, 1998). For this purpose, phosphate buffer solutions were prepared by dissolving 8.5 g K H 2 PO4 , 21.75 g K 2 HPO4 , 33.4 g Na2 HP 0 4 .7 H 2 0 , and 1.7 g N H 4 CI in about 500 ml distilled water and diluted to 1 L. Magnesium sulphate solution was made by dissolving 22.5 g MgS 0 4 .7 H 2 0 in distilled water and diluted to 1 L.

3.S.7.2. Filling the BOD Bottles
Since BOD 5 tests were conducted for various concentrations o f M TBE, different volumes o f MTBE solutions were used in each test. Necessary volume o f samples was added to 300-ml BOD bottles individually. 5 ml o f aerated seed material was added to each bottle and the bottle was filled w ith aerated dilution water. Initial DO measurement was performed by DO meter. As a rough check o f experimental conditions, a dilution water blank including only seed material and dilution water in BOD bottle was used with each batch o f samples. Bottles o f samples were incubated in a New Brunswick scientific C25KC incubator at 20''C without any shaking. After 5 days, the final DO o f samples and blank were measured and BOD 5 was calculated. A sample o f calculation o f BOD 5 is provided in Appendix A.

3.5.8. Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solid (MLVSS)
A well-mixed sample o f sludge was filtered through a weighed 934-A H Whatman glass microfiber filter (Made in England by W & R Balston Limeted) by using buchner funnels connecting to vacuum system. Removed from filtration apparatus, filter was transferred to an aluminium-weighing dish and placed in an oven at 103-105°C for 1 hour. Dried filter was weighed. By considering the weight o f filter paper and the volume o f sample, the total suspended solid (TSS) was determined in mg/L (Standard Methods for the Examination o f Water and Wastewater, 1998):

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

4.1. Photochemical Treatment of MTBE
4.1.1. Dark Reaction
A series o f control experiments were conducted to quantify the loss o f M TBE through volatilization or oxidation by dissolved oxygen. In these dark experiments, solutions o f M TB E were stirred in the reactor without U V lamp, H 2 O2 , or T i 0 2 for 5 hours to verify i f other processes such as volatilization or adsorption contribute to MTBE disappearance. A cooling system around the reactor maintained the temperature at 1520°C. The results o f these experiments are depicted in Figure 4.1. These experiments indicated only 5% decrease o f M TBE during 5 hours, which is negligible.

Since U V lamp produces heat in the photoreactor, the necessity o f cooling system was indicated by conducting a dark reaction experiment along w ith a heating system (instead o f cooling system) w ith the same heating trend that U V lamp produced during the reaction. The temperature examined in the range o f 20-41°C accelerated the rate o f disappearance. 95% loss o f M TB E in 5 hours was observed, which can be the result o f volatilization (Figure 4.2). It is found that the Henry's law constant is temperature dependent and generally increases with increasing temperature. This fact caused less solubility o f M TB E in water w ith increasing the temperature and, therefore, resulted in its high disappearance in the solution. This control test showed that construit temperature

was necessary for these series o f experiments.

4.1.2. Photoreaction
In order to determine whether photolysis contributes to M TBE degradation, its solutions were put in contact w ith U V light. As Stefan et al. (2000) reported M TBE does not absorb UV light greater than 200 nm, so direct photolysis o f M T B E does not occur. Figure 4.3 shows the disappearance o f M TBE due to photolysis by 254 nm U V light. Alm ost 10% decrease in the residual o f M TBE was observed w ith U V lig h t illumination during 5 hours. It may arise from oxidation by oxygen and volatilization. These results point out that photolysis o f M TB E is not an appropriate way for its removal.

4.1.3. The Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide on MTBE Degradation
The effect o f H 2 O2 on the M TBE solution in the absence and presence o f the U V light (Figure 4.4) was examined. As illustrated in Figure 4.4, dark experiments conducted on a mixture o f M TBE/H 2 O 2 did not show any significant reaction between the two compounds and less than 10%' o f M TBE was disappeared after 4 hours.

4.1.3.1. Combination of UV Light and H 2 O 2
In the next step, the photodegradation o f MTBE, w ith the aim to investigate the effect o f a supplementary oxidant was conducted. The use o f a strong oxidant such as H 2 O2 improved the single U V radiation efficiency and considerably increased the destruction o f MTBE. Considering the facts o f negligible decrease o f M TB E by U V and H 2 O2 alone and H 2 O 2 photoactivity at 185-400 nm, it can be concluded that

degradation process must occur by direct photolysis o f H 2O2 . Because o f the increased amount o f hydroxyl radicals, combination o f UV andH 2 O2 results in more rapid degradation o f M TBE according to the following reaction:

H^02

(4.1)

A t low concentrations Qf H 2 O2 , it can absorb light, but not sufficient *0 H is produced. Increasing concentration o f H 2 O2 increases the absorbance, which in turn increased the production o f * OH. Hydroxyl radicals enhanced significantly the reduction o f M TBE in the range 90-98%. The initial concentration o f M TBE was 20 mg/L and the concentration o f H 2 O2 was in the range o f 0.9-24 inM, therefore, the molar ratio o f H 2 O2 to M TBE was in the range o f 4-104. In all cases, more than 90% conversion was observed during the first hour o f irradiation followed by a verj^ slow rate o f degradation (Figure 4.4). This phenomenon can be justified by the production o f hydroperoxyl radicals (HO 2 ), which are much less reactive than hydroxyl radicals.

(4.2)

Another speculation, which can contribute to the decrease o f the rate o f thereaction is the influence o f by-products through their competition for either scavenging the hydroxyl radicals or absorbing the UV light. tert-huiy\ alcohol (TBA) and /er/-butyl formate (TBF) are two major by-products o f MTBE decayed by U V /H 2 O2 (Stefan et al., 2000).

reaction o f TBF with hydroxyl radicals, and the attack o f these radicals on TBA occurs at rate constant o f 6x 10* M ' 's'' (Stefan et al., 2000), which are similar to that o f MTBE reaction with hydroxyl radicals (2x 10®M''s'').

4.I.3.2. The Effect of H 2 O 2 Concentration on MTBE Degradation
Since 'OH reacts with H 2 O 2 , the selection o f appropriate concentration o f H 2O2 is important to minimize the loss o f process efficiency. Optimum concentration o f H 2 O2 was obtained by the comparison between the percentages o f degraded M TBE with different amounts o f H 2 O2 . It was observed that the molar ratio o f H 2 O2 to M TBE had more effect on MTBE degradation than only concentration o f H 2 O2 . Figure 4.5 shows that the optimum molar ratio o f H 2 O2 to M TBE was 14. Balanced equation o f the reaction between ' ÎTBE and H 2 O2 shows that theoretically for complete mineralization the molar ratio o f 15 is required, which confirms the accuracy o f obtained result:

(4.3)

The initial rate o f reaction reached a plateau with increasing the molar ratio o f H2 O 2 to M TBE, likely because the extra H 2 O2 competed with M TBE for the hydroxyl radicals and scavenges them by the following reaction:

H 202 = 0.9 - 24 m M corresponded to the molar ratio o f [H 2 O2] / [M TBE] = 4-104. A cooling system was used to keep the temperature constant at 15-20°C.

In addition, the increase o f H 2 O2 entailed the increase o f intermediates, which may have higher absorption coefficient than that o f H 2O2 and act as an inner filters. The presence o f such intermediates resulted in their competition with H 2 O2 for absorbing the U V light and, therefore, less light would be provided for H 2 O2 to absorb.

After determination o f optimum molar ratio o f H 2 O2 /M TBE, a series o f experiments were conducted by this optimum molar ratio to observe the removal o f MTBE in details in one-hour pc., >d o f time. For this purpose, the initial concentration o f 30 mg/L MTBE with 155 mg/L H 2 O 2 was considered to provide the molar ratio o f H 2 O2 /M TBE = 14. The samples were taken eveiy 10 minutes for analysis. The obtained results showed more than 90% removal o f MTBE in the first 20 minutes o f reaction (Figure 4.6). One mechanism for hydrogen-abstraction is suggesting a radical attack to methoxy group o f MTBE (Stefan et al., 2000):

There are different pathways for reaction (4.7) that result in many different products, which are suggested in Stefan et al.' s study (2000). To find the kinetic rate constants for the initial photochemical degradation o f MTBE in the presence o f H 2 O2 , more studies about the mechanisms o f the reaction was necessary. In the lack o f such information, the overall degradation rate constant was estimated by application o f a mathematical model: 70

Linear regression on natural logarithm o f C/Co versus time showed consistency o f experimental data w ith the model within 30 minutes o f reaction but after this time, the data did not follow the first-orde| model completely. This discrepancy can be explained by the hypothesis o f the competition between H 2 O2 and intermediates for both ' OH and U V light. As mentioned before, the rate constant for reaction o f TBF and TB A with hydroxyl radicals are close to that o f MTBE. On the other hand, intennediates such as acetone and oxalic acid, w ith absorption coefficients much higher than that o f H 2 O2 , can absorb U V light considerably and decrease the rate o f reaction. In fact, the light absorbed by organics can be considered as wasted light. The apparent rate constant for degradation o f MTBE by U V /H 2 O2 was attained during the first 30 minutes (Appendix C) (Figure 4.7), which was equal to 1.3{|]7xlO'' min '. Stefan et ai. (2000) performed their experiments at molar ratio o f H 2 O2/ M TBE equal to 18.26/ 0.92 and suggested a firstorder reaction for decay o f MTBE in 20 minutes by UV/H 2 O2 with rate constant o f 3.47x10'' min'". Disappearance o f hydrogen peroxide within 5 hours followed a zeroorder reaction with rate constant o f 2.13x10' ' mg L"' min"' (Figure 4.8). In the same study, it was suggested a zero-order rate constant o f 3.09x10"' mg L' ' m in'' for consumption o f H 2 O 2 in a period o f 80 minutes. It can be observed that during the first hour o f reaction the amount o f H 2 O2 was almost constant. The general form o f the reaction between M TBE and H 2 O2 Can be defined by following equation:

(4.10)

Since the amount o f H 2 O2 was higher than that o f MTBE, the degradation rate can turn to a first-order reaction with respect to MTBE. This explanation is consistent with the suggested models for both M TBE and H 2 O 2 .

Changes in M TBE along w ith the changes in COD are illustrated in Figure 4.9 A decrease o f COD was observed during the time o f reaction, which was the result o f photooxidation o f both M TBE and intermediates by U V /H 2 O2 process. Figure 4.11 also showed the decrease o f pH, which can be the result o f the formation o f acidic compounds in the presence o f U V /H 2 O 2 . Stefan et al. (2000) also confirmed the presence o f short chain carboxylic acid such as pyruvic, oxalic and formic acid. The amount o f BOD had a steady decrease. A t the beginning o f experiments, was 2 mg/L, changed to 1.5 mg/L w ithin 60 minutes, which corresponded to BOD/COD ratio o f 0.03 and 0.36, respectively (Figure 4.10). Assuming the suggested mechanism by Stefan et al. (2000), it can be interpreted that removal o f M TBE was accompanied by the formation o f its nonbiodegradable intermediates And degradation o f primary intermediates resulted in the formation o f more biodegradable compounds such as formic, pyruvic, and oxalic acid,

which could improve the biodegradability o f solution in term o f BOD/COD (Marco et ah, 1997). Since the degradation o f M TBE was the main goal o f this experiment, which was achieved in
20

minutes, this improvement could not affect its removal from water

although the obtained result can be applied for complete mineralization.

4.I.3.3. Comparison of Different UV-Lights in the Degradation of MTBE by H 2 O 2
To compare the efficiencies o f different U V lights in the degradation o f M TBE by H 2 O2 , two series o f experiments were conducted in which U V lamps w ith 254 nm and 365 nm wavelength were inserted in the reactor, separately. As illustrated in Figure 4.12, the degradation o f M TBE by U V 25 4 /H 2 O 2 was faster than that o f the U V 365 / H 2 O2 . This Figure showed that after 5 hours reaction the U V 2 5 4 /H 2 O2 system could degrade almost 97% o f initial M T B E w hile U V 365 / H 2 O 2 system degraded 54% o f M TBE at the same period o f time. The necessary energy to break the 0 - 0 bond o f H 2 O 2 and to produce * OH is high and equal to 48.5 kcal.mole' ' (Clarke and Knowles, 1982). UV-254 has the radiation energy o f 112.7 kcal.mole' ', while this factor for UV-365 is equal to 78.5 kcal.mole"' (Appendix D). Both o f these U V lights have the capability o f breaking the bond in H 2 O2 , as is illustrated in Figure 4.12, but higher level o f energy in UV-C lamps w ith 200-280 nm makes it efficient for higher degradation rate o f M TBE.

The experiments in the presence o f UV lamp with wavelength o f 254 nm alone (The results are discussed in Section 4.1.3 and illustrated in Figure 4.3) suggested that MTBE had negligible photoactivity and the molecules did not absorb light effectively at 254 nm. On the other hand, the small decrèas'- o f MTBE during its dark reaction with TiO? showed the lack o f tendency for TiOz to react with MTBE and degrade it (Figure 4,13), so the effect o f the presence o f both UV and T iO i for degradation o f MTBE was investigated in next step.

4.1.4.2. Combination o f U V L ig h t and T iO i UV radiation in the presence o f TiO j highly contributed to the removal o f MTBE (Figure 4.14). The effect o f TiO ; concentration was studied in the range o f 0.1 to 5 g/L. Figure 4.15 shows the optimum amount o f TiOa, which was found to be 1.5 g/L. This value was different from what was suggested by Barreto et al. (1995). In their study, it was found that the optimum concentration o f TiOz for a 1 mM solution o f MTBE was 0.125 g/L. In high concentrations o f TiOz, suspended catalyst particles scattered the light and resulted in lower rates because o f lower light transmission in the presence o f increased solid catalyst. Below this optimum level the surface area o f the catalyst was a lim iting factor (Barreto et al., 1995).

During photocatalytic reaction, COD was decreased, but it was slower than that o f MTBE (Figure 4.16). While 84% o f M TBE was degraded within 5 hours, 67% o f COD was removed at the same time. This implied that MTBE was not completely mineralized and new organic matters were produced. This conclusion is consistent w ith the results o f Barreto et al.' s (1995) study, which demonstrated the presence o f TBF, TBA, and acetone in the solution after 300 min. BOD was almost constant, 2 + 0.1 mg/L, and did not show any improvement in biodegradability o f the solution. ru

The pH o f the solution was decreased slowly from 6.2 to 5 during the degradation o f MTBE by UV-254 in different concentrations o f TiOz (Figure 4.17). Barreto et al. (1995) reported the formation o f acidic products such as acetic or formic acids during the reaction, which were consistent with this observation.

in present study were considered for the study o f the overall photocatalytic reaction rate. As shown in Figure 4.18, the linear regressions o f - In (C/Co) versus'time plots were determined in which regression coefficients were greater than 0.9 in all cases. This implied that the removal o f M TBE by U V /T iO ; followed a first-order model with apparent rate constant o f 1.32x
10

'^ min' ' . Barreto et al. (1995) calculated an initial rate

constant o f 7.2 x 10'^ min' ' for the first 20 minutes o f reaction and beyond this time, the rate constant was measured to be 7.8x 10'^ min' ' . As it w ill be discussed later, initial concentration o f M TB E had an inverse effect on the rate constant. Barreto et al. (1995) made a 1 mM solution for their experiments. This difference in initial concentration can ju s tify the difference between obtained values in the two studies. In addition, the value o f 1.32x 10'^ min' ' in this study corresponded to a complete 5-h reaction time.

Generally, the kinetic

o f heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions follow the

Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism (Herrmann, 1999):

dt

\ + KC

(4.14)

Where k is the reaction rate constant and K is the equilibrium constant o f adsorption. In low concentrations o f C, KC < 1 and the reaction becomes the first-order. This explanation is consistent with the obtained experimental data and suggested model.

examine the effect o f in itia l concentrations on the degradation rate o f MTBE. Since M T B E degradation follow s a first-order reaction, plots o f - In (C/Co) versus time resulted straight lines with different slops depending on the initial concentration o f MTBE. As shown in Figures 4.19-4.22, the apparent rate constants decreased w ith increasing MTBE concentration. As these Figures illustrate, in the presence o f 1.5 g/L TiOz, the apparent rate constants for solutions w ith initia l concentration o f 3.8 and 6.8 mg/L M TBE were 0.023 and 0.0174 min"', respectively. Also, in the presence o f Ü.5 mg/L TiO i, the apparent rate constant io r ..elutions w ith initial concentration o f 2.7 and 7.6 mg/L MTBE were 0.0155 and 0.0081 m in '', respectively. These can be explained by assuming that the by-products were competing w ith M TB E for the site o f the surface o f TiO ;. The main intermediate products o f the photocatalytic reaction o f M TB E were identified to be TBF, T B A , and acetone (Barreto et al., 1995).

4.1.4.5. Com parison o f D iffe re n t U V -Lights in D egradation o f M T B E by TiOz Photocatalysis The comparison between degradation rate in application o f U V 254 and UV 365 revealed that the light w ith 254 nm wavelength had more effectiveness on degradation o f M TB E than 365 nm. Figure 4.23 shows more than 90% decrease for the degradation o f M T B E by U Vz^/TiO z system while the removal o f M TB E by UVaôs/TiOz was less than 70%. TiOz has band-gap energy o f 3.02 eV, which means the electrons in valance band can be promoted to conduction band by U V w ith 1 < 400 n m . Although considerable removal o f M TBE was observed w ith both UV-254 and UV-365, the higher level o f energy in former could contribute to the degradation and improved its rate, therefore,

Also, degradation rate o f solution with molar ratio o f H 2 O2 / M TBE = 18 decreased from 93% to 26% by addition o f 1.5 g/L T i 0 2 during 1 hour.

Another possibility is the competition between H 2 O2 and MTBE for 'O H , which could result in decrease o f degradation rate after addition o f H 2 O 2 to U V /T i 0 2 .

4.2. Biological Treatment of MTBE
4.2.1. Inhibitory Effects of MTBE and its Intermediates
Application o f AOPs may entail the production o f more toxic intermediates than the parent compounds. Therefore, to evaluate the effects o f AGP products on their biodégradation, inhibitory tests are necessary. To verify the inhibitory effects o f MTBE, TBA, and TBF on microbial activity, a source o f carbon, easily used by polyseed microorganisms, was added to BOD bottles and the oxygen consumption by

J

microorganisms was compared in the absence and presence o f different concentrations o f pollutants (Bolduc and Anderson, 1997). For this purpose, sodium acetate was chosen as a readily utilized carbon source. BOD bottles wilhout/'with 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 5 mg/L o f MTBE were prepared containing seed materials, dilution water, and 5 mg/L sodium acetate. The same procedure was followed for TB A and TBF with 10, 50, and 100 mg/L solutions. In the presence o f constant amount o f sodium acetate and with increasing o f pollutants, the results o f BOD 5 interpreted in three ways: decrease of the oxygen demand corresponded to an inhibitory or toxic effect o f pollutant on the microorganisms, slightly lower consumption o f oxygen than that o f the pure sodium acetate suggested that pollutant neither had toxic effect nor were easily consumed by

microorganisms, and finally, increase o f oxygen consumption corresponded to oxidation o f pollutant by microorganisms. The details o f the method and calculations are explained in Section 3.2.7 and Appendix A.

Table 4.1 and Figure 4.26 present the result o f these experiments. As this Table and Figure show, increasing the amounts o f M TBE, TBA, and TBF in the solution o f 5 mg/L sodium acetate did not have a great impact on the microorganisms for their oxygen consumption.

The highest BOD 5 was corresponded to the solution containing 5 mg/L sodium acetate and 30 mg/L M TBE. Interpretation o f the obtained results leads to this conclusion that these compounds do not have toxic effects on living organisms and their consumption by microorganisms can be observed under certain conditions.

4.2.2. Ultimate BOD Determination
Table 4.2 and Figure 4.27 and illustrate that the BODu, determined by the dailydifference method (Section 3.2.2.1), for solutions containing 5, 10, 30, and 50 mg/L o f M TBE were 3.55, 3.76, 4 and, 4.89 mg/L, which resulted in the first-order rate constants o f 0.099, 0.096, 0.118, and 0.101 day'' at 20°C, respectively. Although the value o f BO D 5 and therefore the value o f BODu were higher for solution o f 50 mg/L MTBE, the highest rate o f oxygen consumption corresponded to the solution with 30 mg/L MTBE, which meant more tendencies o f microorganisms for usage o f this concentration. Calculations for determination o f rate constants are presented in Appendix E.

4.2.3. Biodégradation o f MTBE by Mixed Culture
The possibility o f degradation o f M TB E by mixed culture was studied and its biodégradation was tracked by measurement o f MTBE. Details o f procedure are explained in Section 3.2.2.2. Liquid culture was collected and filtered, and cell-free aqueous sample was injected into GC to determine M TB E concentration in liquid phase.

During a 30-day time-course, almost 70% o f initial amount o f M T B E was decreased. To study the rate o f biodégradation, a Monod model was m odified and applied. Follow ing equation defines the rate o f bacterial growth (M etcalf and Eddy, 1991):

(4.18)

Where: = Rate o f bacterial growth, mass/ volume . time // = Specific growth rate, tim e'' X = Concentration o f microorganism, mass/ volume

The specific growth rate has a relationship w ith the substrate concentration, which is experimentally proposed by Monod:

In a microbial system the rate o f bacterial growth is proportional to the rate o f substrate consumption by follow ing relationship:

substituted by a new constant as k which leads to the following first-order equation for substrate consumption by microorganisms:

- = -kS dt

(4.22)

Figure 4.28 depicts that biodégradation followed a first-order reaction rate w ith low rate constant o f 4.36x 10'^ day''. It means that more than 150 days are required to achieve the M TBE concentration in the range set by EPA at Drinking Water Advisory (EPA, 2003).

During the biodégradation period in shake flasks, a decrease o f pH from 7 to 4.5 was observed, which suggested the formation o f some acidic compounds. Figure 4.29 shows the COD changes in the biodégradation period. COD declined at a slower rate than did MTBE. W hile 70% o f M TBE was degraded w ithin 30 days, 40% o f COD was removed at the same time. This result implied the accumulation o f intermediates that were not readily biodegradable. Although the amount o f M TB E was decreased, the biodégradation could not proceed w ith the new products and resulted in their accumulation. Many researchers studied the mechanism o f bioremediation o f M TBE and identified TB A and TBF as the primary products (Steffan et ah, 1997; Salanitro et ah, 1994; Hemandez-perez et ah, 2001; and Fayolle et ah, 2003), w hich are not readily biodegradable and rarely take part in biological reactions.

4.2.4. Biodégradation of MTBE by Acclimated Activated Sludge
As explained in Section 3.2.2.3.1, an acclimatization process was followed by gradually increasing the concentration o f MTBE from 10 mg/L to 30 mg/L. Addition o f M TBE during acclimation period resulted in almost constant amount o f BOD 5 o f 4 ± 0.15 mg/L, which meant that in spite o f the decreasing amount o f sodium acetate, the biodegradable part o f nutrients was not changed, in other words, microorganisms could adjust themselves w ith new changes in their environment and could switch their carbon consumptions from sodium acetate to MTBE. Although microorganisms showed a slow growth rate, which could not be tracked by the present anal>tical balance in the laboratory, the increase o f 100 mg/L cell dry weight at the end o f acclimation period still confirmed their adjustment with new conditions. The initial and final values o f pH were 7.5 and 6.3, respectively, which gives the conclusion o f increasing amount o f acidic products.

As it was mentioned in Section 3.2.2.3.1, the endpoint o f acclimation process was the presence o f 30 mg/L MTBE in the bioreactor. After accomplishment o f acclimation phase, the main biological treatment started (Section 3.2.2.3.2). The initial BOD 5 for 30 mg/L solution o f M TBE was 4.95, which was higher than that o f the non-acclimated culture. This implied that with the same initial concentrations o f M TBE in both biloreactors, microorganisms in SBR are exposed to more available nutrients and had more tendencies for MTBE consumption. Figure 4.30 illustrates the trend o f

biodégradation o f M TBE in SBR. Acclimation led to the increase o f biological activity and eventually greater degradation. A zero-order model can have the best fit with

obtained results. Compared with degradation rate constant in non-acclimated case, it had considerable improvement and became equal to 3.235x 10'* mg L'* h'*. This comparison showed that while a solution o f 30 mg/L o f M TBE can be treated by nonacclimated organisms in 150 days to reach to the level set by EPA for MTBE in drinking water, the same removal o f M TBE can be occurred in 90 h with acclimated microorganisms. Fortin et al. (2001) suggested a zero-order constant rate o f 2.8 mgL'*h'* for the degradation o f up to 10,0 mg/L MTBE by a microbial consortium- cultivated in liquid system designated as F-consortium.

In this study, the amount o f cell growth was so small for each run that could not be measured with the present analytic balance in the laboratory, but after three consecutive runs, 7 mg/L microbial growth was observed. A ll these facts implied that the acclimation phase was successfully implemented. pH decrease from 6.5 to
6

during the degradation o f

MTBE by acclimated microorganisms indicated the production o f acidic compounds. The result o f BOD and COD tests for acclimated microorganisms during removal o f MTBE are illustrated in Figures 4.31 and 4.32. 85% degradation o f MTBE during 71 h was accompanied with 45% and 75% removal o f COD and BOD, respectively. One hypothesis that could be suggested from the analysis o f these results was that acclimated microorganisms, which could degrade M l BE effectively, were not capable o f degrading by-products and therefore these compounds accumulated in the system and slowed down the rate o f COD removal. The rate o f decrease o f MTBE was the same as o f BOD, which implied that the only biodegradable source for living microorganisms in this system was MTBE. A t the same time, removal o f COD was not significant and 55% COD remained

after removal o f MTBE. Like non-acclimated situation, here again biotreatment led to formation o f the non-biodegradable products, which was the reason for by-products accumulation. The BOD/COD ratio, which is a good indication o f biodegradability, decreased from 0.07 to 0.03. The change o f this ratio can be explained by this fact that BOD decreased because M TBE was consumed but at the same time the rate o f COD reduction became slower because non-biodegradable by-products were fomied.

Assembling all these results confirms that the intermediates were not biodegradable and could not be consumed by these acclimated microorganisms.

4.2.5. Combination of Photochemical and Biological Processes for the Treatment of MTBE
In combination process, first a solution with 50 mg/L M TBE and 1.5 g/L TiO^ was introduced to photochemical reactor and after 1.5 h the effluent containing 30 mg/L o f M TBE centrifuged and the supernatant transferred to SBR to be treated by acclimated microorganisms (Section 3.3). A similar study was conducted in SBR and the zero-order rate constant was equal to 2.825 x 10'' mg L"' I f ' (Figure 4.33). The removal o f COD was similar to what occurred in non-treated solution (Figure 4.34), which was slower than degradation rate o f MTBE.
68

% degradation o f MTBE occurred w ith decrease o f COD,

but still 65% COD was not treated and remained in the solution. This implied that the acclimation and the adjustment o f microorganisms to M TBE did not necessarily entail their adjustment to by-products, therefore, the biodegradability o f photoreaction products must be taken into account. As a result, they were accumulated since the time they entered to bioreactor. In addition, formation o f new intermediates in biological reactor, as

When the biodégradation rate o f non-treated solution was compared to that o f the pre treated one (Figure 4.33), the value o f 0.041 min"' slower rate constant in non-treated case gave this conclusion that pre-treatment by U V /T iO i did not enhance the performance o f the biodégradation o f MTBE. The lower rate o f M T B E consumption can be interpreted that the presence o f intermediates coming from chemical treatment interfered the biotreatment o f M TBE and made its degradation slower. Since in combination process microorganisms confront with intermediates as w ell as MTBE, in acclimation phase the presence o f intermediates must be considered.

4.2.6. Cost Optimization for Combined Photochemical and Biological Processes for the Treatment of MTBE
In the last part o f this study, by the knowledge o f degradation rate in each photochemical and biological phase, the combined processes were optimized for relative cost in order to find an economic and efficient method o f treatment. This part o f current study did aim to provide a cost optimization and not a cost estimation, because a comprehensive estimation o f costs needed more studies and was out o f the defined goals o f this study. The purpose o f the optimization was a simply comparison between different possible treatments o f M TBE, therefore, the relative cost, and not the real cost, was

estimated for each process and this term was compared. The values o f relative costs for various methods o f treatment were used as a tool to compare them from the economic point o f view. Since this term is only used for comparison, it is not expressed in any units. The high values correspond to expensive methods and low values indicate less expensive method o f treatment. For example, a photochemical process w ith relative cost o f 1000 is 5 times more expensive than a biological process w ith relative cost o f 200.

An important step in the combination process is the determination o f a goal in order to define the efficiency o f the process. The efficiency values are good tools to optimize the conditions in a combined system (Scott and Oilis, 1995). In a combined process, efficiency o f each chemical and biological process determines the global efficiency (Scott and Ollis, 1996). Measurement o f efficiency should be conducted w ithin the definition o f constraints. Without constraints, process with higher efficiency would have an indefinite reaction time until the global goal is achieved (Scott and Ollis, 1995).

The most crucial part o f the optimization process is the appropriate formulation o f the problem. Optimization in the operation o f the process includes the formulation o f a suitable objective function and a mathematical description o f the processes, which form a set o f constraints. The objective o f optimization in this study was the cost minimization in a coupled photochemical-biological system by achieving the required amount o f M TBE through the definition o f the residence time in each photochemical or biological reactor.

Since there are inherent differences between chemical and biological treatments, the follow ing considerations and simplifications were considered; - The estimation included the cost o f reactors w ithin the reaction time, therefore, the cost o f additional operations such as neutralization, centrifuge, filtration, reutilization o f TiOz, acclimatization, and transfer o f solution between reactors were not included. Also, chemical costs and capital investment were ignored. This assumption made the cost optimization be prim arily based on the reaction time. - The effect o f initial concentration o f MTBE on both chemical and biological reaction rates was ignored and for constants reaction rate in photoreaction, the value o f 1.32x10'^ min"' and in bioreaction for non-treated and pre-treated solutions values o f 3.235 X 10` * and 2.825x 10"' mg L"' h"' were considered, respectively. - For degradation o f TBF, as the primary and major product o f M TB E degradation by UV/TiOz, a psuedo first-order reaction w ith the rate constant o f considered (Barreto et al., 1995). - For estimating the process cost, logarithmic relationship, known as the six-tenthsfactor rule (Peters and Timmerhaus, 1991), was used as a volumetric cost scale. In this rule, when the cost o f a unit at given volume is known, the cost o f sim ilar unit with X times volume o f the first one is about (X)°'* times the cost o f initial unit. This is the reason that is called volumetric cost scale. Using this factor is an oversimplification o f cost model because the cost capacity factor differs from 0.2 to greater than 1 (Peters and Timmerhaus, 1991), but in the lack o f other information, 0.6 factor can be an appropriate estimation.

Since individual reactor volume is proportional to individual residence time (Esplugas and Ollis, 1997), the six-tenths-factor rule was applied and a model for estimation o f the relative cost in the combined processes was developed (Esplugas and Ollis, 1997): / = Cost function : t^ / + at^^ (4.32)

Where a is the volumetric cost ratio between AOP and biological reactor, which must be equal or greater than 1. With increasing the parameter a above unity, the chemical reactor cost exceeds that o f the bioreactor (Esplugas and Ollis, 1997). Esplugas and Ollis (1997) studied l < a < l O for ozone and peroxide combined with activated

sludge treatment, but in the absence o f the information about the relative cost in UV/TiO? and biological processes, for this study a assumed to be 5, although the effect o f a w ill be discussed later. The new cost function, as an objective function, was defined as:

/ = Objective function :

+ 5t°'^

(4.33)

The optimum amount o f the residence time in each reactor depended on the required overall efficiency. Based on the first assumption o f this optimization, the optimum

123

residence time can result in the optimum amount o f the operation cost. The efficiency o f the individual and overall processes was defined as the ratio o f the amount of the converted MTBE to its initial amount (Scott and Ollis, 1996).

n r = (C o-c^)/C o n g = (C r-C g )/C o f ir --(C q --C^)/Co = T|r

(4.34) (4.35) (4.36)

Where; fic = Efficiency in photoreactor T|B = Efficiency in bioreactor tjT = Overall efficiency

The favourite efficiency for integrated system makes the objective function to have a response within the constraints, and optimal operating times in each reactor were identified under given constraints. Since the cost o f each process was assumed to be proportional to the cost o f reactor within the residence time, the optimization was primarily based on the reaction time, and, therefore the cost optimization could be accomplished through the measurement o f the optimal residence time in each reactor. The final goal o f treatment was to achieve the MTBE concentration set by EPA at Drinking Water Advisory (EPA, 2003), which means that the residue o f this compound after biological treatment (C b) should be less than 0.04 mg/L. This value defined the overall efficiency and imposed a constraint to the objective function. In addition, there

was no production o f MTBE in the system, so Cb must be equal or less than Cc- For the same reason Cc must be equal or less than
C q.

Also the only source o f TBF was the

degradation o f M TBE in photoreactor, therefore C t must be less than or equal to Co- The standard formulation form o f this optimization problem would be:

The optimization problem was solved by Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG2) non-linear optimization method (Appendix F). Cc, C j and Cb were adjusted until the constraints in the problem were satisfied and the objective function was minimized. The results showed that the minimum relative cost would be 158 i f solution remained in photoreactor for 176 minutes, which resulted in 2.93 and 8.54 mg/L concentrations o f

The changes o f minimum objective function with different values o f ratio o f volumetric cost, a , were investigated. The results are summarized in Table 4.3.

As it was mentioned before, the increase o f the parameter a above unity results in the chemical reactor cost exceeds that o f the bioreactor (Esplugas and Ollis, 1997), Therefore in the cost optimization, the increase o f a decreased the tendency o f chemical reaction until the biological treatment completely dominated the process at a - ] 0 . Although the chemical portion decreased by increase o f a , at the same time the overall cost was increased, which meant that a had important roll in the cost estimation. I f

Table 4.3 shows that the decrease o f a and consequently the increase o f chemical residence time increased the organic removal. Considering a - 5 , the same optimization procedure was followed with the value o f rate constant in non-acclimated

microorganisms process. In that case, the effect o f the presence o f chemical by-products on the rate o f biological reaction was ignored. Because o f the low rate o f biological reaction, optimization resulted in an almost 500-minute single photoreaction with relative cost o f 208; therefore, the combination process was meaningless.

Optimization in this sequence did not result in a combined system but led to a single photochemical or a single biological process with relative cost o f 208 and 176, respectively. The single step photoreaction required almost 500 minutes time while bioreaction alone by acclimated microorganisms would be completed w ithin 5548 minutes.

Table 4.4 shows a comparison between different combinations o f photochemical and biological treatment. The optimization showed that the most cost-efficient process was a chemical/biological treatment w ith relative cost o f 159. A single biological treatment by

130

acclimated microorganisms can be the next option, which lasts for 5548 minutes and has the relative cost o f 176. Single chemical reaction takes 502 minutes, and its relative cost would be 208. The longest and the most expensive process would be the treatment o f M TBE by non-acclimated microorganisms which can be completed in 220000 minutes and has 1605 relative cost. Optimization o f biological/chemical process resulted in either single chemical or single biological treatment; therefore, the cost-efficiency o f these processes had the follow ing order (Figure 4.36):

Chemical/biological, single biological (acclimated), single chemical, and single biological (non-acclimated).

The difference between the cost o f non-acclimated treatment and o f the one in which acclimated microorganisms are used should be compared with the costs o f the acclimatization to ju s tify the selection o f any o f these processes. As mentioned before, the relative cost, not the real cost, was defined for this optimization to compare the cost o f different process o f treatment. For example this tool shows that the cost o f treatment o f M TBE by non-acclimated microorganisms is about 9 times more than that o f treatment by acclimated microorganisms (1605-f-176 = 9.1), or single photochemical treatment costs about 1.3 times more than combined treatment (208 4-159= 1.3).

Predictably, the shortest and the longest treatment were single chemical and single biological (non-acclimated) processes, respectively (Figure 4.37). Obtained results from optimization showed that the chemical/biological process had the lowest level o f organic

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1. Conclusions
The following conclusions were drawn from this thesis:

·

An important result emerging from this study was that U V /H 2 O 2 and UV/TiOz could be used to remove M TBE from water. Degradation o f MTBE w ith H 2 O2 in the presence o f UV was a first-order reaction w ith respect to MTBE and the apparent rate constant was found to be 1.307x10'' min"' during the first 30 minutes o f reaction. The disappearance o f H 2 O 2 followed a zero-order reaction with rate constant o f 2.13x10'' mg L ''m in ''. For treatment o f M TB E the highest effective amount o f T i 0 2 in U V /T i 0 2 process was 1.5 g/L and the reaction was modeled by a first-order equation with apparent rate constant o f 1.32x
10

'^ min"'.

·

Combination o f U V /H 2 O2 and U V /T i 0 2 did not have any advantages over each o f them alone. Competition between M TBE and H 2 O 2 for the surface o f T i 0 2 could be the reason o f this decrease in rate o f reaction.

·

Since M TBE is a poor substrate as sole carbon source, it should be biodegraded under controlled aerobic conditions. Acclim ation of

microorganisms to M TBE could improve its rate o f biodégradation and promote the apparent rate constant from 4.36x10'^ day"' to

3.235x10 ' mg L"' h

Pre-treatment o f M TBE by photocatalytic process did not improve its bioderadability. The obtained results support this hypothesis that

intermediates in primary phase have important role in the efficiency and proceeding o f the combined process because their property can enhance or deter the next step.

When the costs in photoreactor are much more than that in bioreactor (such as a = 5), a combination o f photochemical/biological treatment can be suggested as an economic option. Although chemical pre-treatment cannot enhance the biodegradability, the high difference in costs can ju stify this combination.

Optimization o f different combinations o f chemical and biological processes showed that only w ith acclimated microorganisms, the biological treatment (either single or in conjunction w ith chemical treatment) could be an economic option; otherwise, a single chemical treatment would be the most cost-effective process.

5.2. Recommendations
· Studies should be performed to identify and quantify the intermediates and to define the mechanisms in both chemical and biological processes. The complete mineralization should be tracked by measurement o f total organic carbon (TOC) to ensure the removal o f initial and produced organic compounds.

·

The intermediates, which are formed in photoreactor, are introduced into the bioreactor in a combined system, therefore the presence o f these

intermediates should be considered in the process o f acclimatization.

·

To have more precise optimization, detailed studies are required to estimate the cost in each process and consequently propose a comprehensive model. By considering all existing costs in both processes, this model can prevent some simplifications that were unavoidable in this study in the absence o f adequate information.

·

Since natural waters contain many other chemical species, studies should be conducted to investigate the interaction between various substrates and the effect o f their presence on the efficiency o f the treatment.

A: Determination of B O D 5
In BOD test after 5 days incubation at 20°C, the final DO o f samples and blank were measured and BOD; was calculated as follows:

B O D ,,m g /L = ( A - D , ) - { B l - B , ) f

i)

Where: D| = DO o f diluted sample immediately after preparation, mg/L D 2 = DO o f diluted sample after 5 day incubation at 20°C, mg/L P = Decimal volumetric fraction o f sample used B| = DO o f seed control before incubation, mg/L B 2 = DO o f seed control after incubation, mg/L / = Ratio o f seed in diluted sample to seed in seed control

To measure the BOD; for a solution o f 10 mg/L o f MTBE, BOD bottle was filled with 295 ml o f aerated M TBE solution, 5 ml o f aerated seed material, and nutrients. A ll details for BOD test are in Section 3.5.7. The initial and final DO were 7.60 and 6.17 mg/L, respectively. A t the same time, the initial and final DO in blank bottle were 7.82 and 7.80 mg/L, respectively, therefore:

F: Optimization Results ·
GRG2 uses an implementation o f the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm, which solves nonlinear optimization problems. It seeks a feasible solution first ( if one is not provided) and then retains feasibility as the objective is improved. It uses the quasiNewton algorithm as its default choice for determining a search direction. There are two essential steps that must be taken in order to present an optimization problem to GRG2. First, a function must be written to compute values o f the constraint functions and the objective function for given values o f the variables. Next, the data that describe the optimization problem must be created, organized, and passed to GRG2. The data consist o f the variables, lower and upper bounds on the variables and the functions (constraint functions plus the objective function). A tool in Microsoft Excel, called solver, was used to solve the optimization problem in this study by GRG2.

Tables f . l, f. 2 , f.3.1, and f.3.2 show the obtained results o f solution o f optimization problem for cost estimation by GRG2;
