ABSTRACT

NUMERICAL STUDY OF THE TARGETED ENERGY TRANSFER BETWEEN THE EULER-BERNOULLI BEAM AND A NONLINEAR ENERGY SINK © Mohi Uddin Rahamat Ullah, 2013 Master of Applied Science In the program of Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University

Targeted energy transfer (TET) refers to the spatial transfer of energy between a primary structure of interest and isolated oscillators called the energy sink (ES). In this work, the primary structure of interest is a slender beam modeled by the Euler-Bernoulli theory, and the ES is a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator with either linear or cubic nonlinear stiffness property. The objective of this study is to characterize the TET and the effectiveness of ES under impact and periodic excitations. By using the scientific computation package, MATLAB, numerical simulations are carried out based on excitations of various strength and locations. Both time and frequency domain characterizations are used. For the impact excitation, the ES with the cubic nonlinear stiffness property is more superior to the linear oscillator in that larger percentage of the impact energy can be dissipated there. The main energy transfer was found to be due to a 3to-1 frequency coupling between the first bending mode and the ES. For the periodic excitation, however, both linear and nonlinear ES exhibit generally poorer performance than the case with the impact excitation. Future works should focus on the frequency-energy relationship of the periodic solution of the underlying Hamiltonian, as well as using finite element model to verify the simulation results.

Chapter 1 Introduction and Literature Review
Vibration analysis of structure is of critical importance in applications: from the structural integrity of the skyscraper, stability of the offshore oil platform, to the comfort of a running vehicle, and the motion of the satellite. The central theme of such analysis has been to discover innovative ways to channel and to dissipate unwanted vibration energy in a timely and effective fashion. Classical tuned mass damper based on the notion of vibration absorption of linear oscillator provides the prime example of how the vibration of a main system of interest can be completely annihilated by attaching a secondary oscillatory system [1]. Indeed, such concepts have been successfully put into use in well known slender structures all over the world, such as the Dublin Spire in Ireland, the Bloomberg building in New York City, and the Taipei 101 building in Taiwan. While the idea of vibration absorption can be successfully implemented, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the vibration energy transfer and achieving better robustness against environmental variation remain as major challenges facing the field. In recent decades, the idea of using nonlinear oscillators as the secondary system attached to a primary system has been considered, and shown to be capable of meeting these challenges.

1.1.

Background This thesis describes the investigation on the Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) from a

multimodal beam vibration to the Energy Sink (ES). The beam can experience various external disturbances such as impact loading, periodic or random excitation. The purpose of the ES is to absorb or dissipate the unwanted vibration of the beam due to the disturbance. An ES is normally modelled with a nonlinear or linear stiffness term and a linear viscous damping term. It can therefore be categorized as nonlinear energy sink (NES) or linear energy sink (LES). The main energy transfer mechanism is contributed by "mode locking" of specific frequency of vibration of the beam and the ES. For the beam, or more generally, other structural members, this frequency is mostly the natural frequency. For the ES, it is related to the frequency of the limit cycle. Hence, the energy is channeled through a kind of resonance mechanism or resonant modal

1   

interaction to ES [2, 3]. The attachment of the ES can be grounded or ungrounded and it can be single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) or multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system depending on the design and use. In this work, an ungrounded and light-weight ES is chosen. In addition, the so-called "essentially" nonlinear ES is considered. For the NES this is when the nonlinear restoring force does not contain a linear stiffness term and only cubic nonlinearity is included (Chapter 2). As a result, NES does not have any resonance frequency in the sense of linear oscillator.

1.2.

Literature Review

This section contains the survey of pertinent literature of TET. In the context of vibration theory, TET can in general be regarded as the method of energy control. Vakakis [4] suggested that the NES can be considered as a generalization of the concept of the classical linear vibration absorber. Nayfeh and Mook [5] showed that in a vibration system with coupled nonlinear oscillators, energy interactions can occur via the mechanism of internal resonance where the vibration of the coupled oscillators "locked" into a specific frequency ratio. In connection to TET, Vakakis [4] coined the term resonance capture to describe TET. The analysis of internal resonance is a technically challenging task, and requires basic concepts, methodologies and computational techniques from the dynamical systems and applied mathematics, such as bifurcation theory, asymptotic approximations, and numerical signal processing [6]. In the works by Gendelman et al. [8] and Vakakis et al. [7] a grounded and relatively heavy nonlinear attachment is investigated. To obtain a better understanding of the energy transfer, the authors analyzed the dynamics of the underlying Hamiltonian system. Lee et al. [9] examined the energy exchange between the oscillators in the damped vibration of a 2-DOF system and identified at least three different energy transfer mechanisms. They are either fundamental and subharmonic resonance captures or nonlinear beat phenomena. Malatkar and Nayfeh [10] experimentally analyzed the nonlinear energy transfer between widely spaced modes in harmonically forced system. The authors showed that passive energy transfer is caused by the resonance interaction at the Hopf bifurcation frequency of the NES and the natural frequency of the first mode of the linear oscillator. Lee et al. [2] studied the multimodal vibration of the primary structure and demonstrated resonance interaction between NES and the vibration modes of the primary structure. By
2   

facilitating these energy transfers, through the excitation of periodic and quasi-periodic motions, significant input energy dissipation via the oscillation of NES was shown. Glendelman et al. [11] investigated the dynamics of a linear oscillator coupled to an essentially nonlinear attachment of substantially lower mass. It is demonstrated that efficient energy transfer can be obtained for a small attachment mass with properly chosen damping and coupling terms of the system. Two mechanisms of energy transfer in the system were revealed; one is the resonance capture and the second is related to the non-resonant excitation of the attachment at the high frequency. Dynamics of a linear oscillator with strongly nonlinear attachment having small mass and multiple states of equilibrium has been investigated by Gendelman and Lamarque [12]. Three types of dynamical regimes during the energy transfer were revealed in their works. First, energy pumping where the energy is efficiently transferred to the nonlinear attachment, second, smooth damping where the system loses its energy smoothly without essential pumping to the attachment, and third, transient chaos between the primary mass and the attachment. Gendelman et al. [13] considered MDOF NES and demonstrated the TET can be significantly enhanced. They showed that, if the primary structure is excited by the shock energy above a certain critical threshold, the NES can effectively absorb the vibration energy from the primary structure in an irreversible manner. In addition, they showed that the efficiency of vibration protection and shock mitigation using NES exceeds those of the linear tuned mass damper. Besides, due to their essential stiffness nonlinearities, the NESs can operate over broad frequency ranges. But these authors found that high TET efficiency of the SDOF NES is only achieved in the relatively narrow range of the external forcing amplitudes. In the works by Gendelman et al. [8] the use of a combination of coupled, linear and nonlinear ES to achieve energy transfer was considered. It was shown that 1:1 stable subharmonic motion of the underlying Hamiltonian system was mainly responsible for the energy transfer between the ES and the primary system. Kerschen et al. [14] studied energy transfer from a damped linear oscillator to an ungrounded light-weight nonlinear oscillator. It is shown that energy transfer is caused by either fundamental or subharmonic resonance capture and in some cases it is initiated by nonlinear beat phenomena. Jiang et al. [15] demonstrated application of NESs to shock isolation. Essentially nonlinear stiffness elements were used for robust energy transfer at a sufficiently fast timescale,
3   

because fast energy transfer at the early stage is crucial for shock isolation purposes. By adding two symmetrically placed NESs these authors showed that it is possible to achieve dual mode shock isolation to reduce unwanted disturbances generated at different ends of the primary system.

1.3.

Research Objectives

The external disturbance of impact or periodic excitation is considered in this investigation. The objective of this study is to conduct numerical simulation to analyze TET and the beam. Of particular interest is the energy transfer pattern in terms of how it varies with the parameters of the input excitation, such as impact strength, periodic forcing amplitude, frequency as well as the location of the disturbance. Numerical analysis is also focused on the estimation of frequency modes involved in the energy transfer and how such coupling varies with the input parameters.

Thesis Overview

This research is arranged in five chapters. Chapter two presents the mathematical model of the beam and ES. The equations of motion for both beam and ES are derived using Newton's second law of motion. In Chapter three, numerical analysis of the TET due to impact intensity is presented based on the free vibration analysis and periodic excitation is discussed in Chapter four. Finally Chapter five contains a summary of the contributions of this research and suggestion for future work.

Chapter 2 Mathematical Model of Beam and Energy Sink
In this chapter the mathematical modeling of a beam structure with an energy sink component is described. This base model is used to investigate the targeted energy transfer. In section 2.1 the beam and energy sink models are presented. In section 2.2, dimensionless equations of motion are derived. In section 2.3, modal characterizations of the beam vibration are described. In section 2.4, the kinetic and potential energies of the beam are derived and in section 2.5, other energy terms that are used to characterize TET in both the beam and ES are defined.

Modeling of the Beam and Energy Sink

2.1.1. Equation of Motion of the Beam The beam model considered in this research has a clamped-clamped boundary condition with a cross-sectional area A, density  and length L. A standard Cartesian coordinates system is used to describe the beam transverse displacement w( x, t ) ; see Figure 2.1. Let the transverse external load per unit length be f ( x, t ) , a damping force per unit length f c  
w , flexural rigidity of t

the beam EI, where E is the Young's elastic modulus for the beam and I is the cross-sectional area moment of inertia about the z-axis. In this study, Euler-Bernoulli beam is assumed. Hence, the beam is a slender beam (large width-to-depth ratio) and only small amplitude oscillation is considered.

The energy sink is assumed to consist of a spring and viscous damper element. Both linear and nonlinear springs (cubic nonlinearity) will be considered. In addition, the following simplifications are made.  Uniform mass per unit length.  Linear, homogeneous, isotropic and elastic material.  Constant E, I and A.

Here, M ( x , t ), V ( x, t ) and M ( x  dx, t ), V ( x  dx, t ) represent the bending moment, and the shear force at the left and right ends of the beam element, respectively. The shear force and bending moment relationships are given as

(2.2)

Note that the term f ( x, t ) from the above denotes the external force applied to the beam. The reaction force from the energy sink at the point of attachment will be the primary source of this load (see section 2.1.2). The case of the beam subjected to an external impulsive or a harmonic
6   

force excitation will also be considered. In that case, f (x, t) will be given by the sum of two terms: one from the reaction force of the energy sink and the other from the external forcing.

2.1.2. Equations of Motion for the Energy Sink The energy sink (ES) attached to the beam is modeled as a lumped mass-spring-damper system of mass m , damping coefficient c and stiffness constant k . A linear and nonlinear ES denoted as LES and NES, respectively, are considered. A LES is given by the standard linear mass-springdamper system. A NES is characterized by a strongly nonlinear spring element of cubic nonlinearity without a linear stiffness term. Let y(t ) , wd (t ) and F (t ) be the vertical absolute displacement of the damper mass, beam and damping force at the location x  d , respectively; (see Figures 2.1). Applying Newton's 2nd law of motion (see Figure 2.3) yields

Kinetic and Potential Energy of the Beam

To assess the energy transfer between the beam and the ES, it is necessary to excite the beam and estimate the energy dissipation in the ES. Both impact and periodic excitations are considered in this work. By the basic impulse momentum principle, the impact can be characterized by giving an initial velocity for the beam element. The purpose of this section is to derive the initial conditions due to the impact and the energy terms that are necessary to characterize the energy transfer between the beam and the ES.

The potential energy (PE) of a beam element is derived from the strain energy. For the EulerBernoulli beam, only the strain energy from the flexural bending is considered.

Energy Variables for ES and TET Analysis

In this section, the energy variables that are used to characterize the TET between the beam and ES are defined. Both the energy remaining in the beam and the ES as well as the energy dissipated by the ES are of main importance in the characterization. When the excitation is by the impulsive force, the total instantaneous energy of the beam, ETbeam , is calculated by adding kinetic energy and potential energy of all the vibration modes ( Emn ). The total instantaneous energy of the ES, ETES , is calculated from the Hamiltonian of the undamped ES.

The instantaneous energy in the ES and bending modes can be examined by computing the nondimensional energy ratio Ed and Ebn , respectively. Here Ed denotes the portion of instantaneous total energy stored in the ES, and Ebn denotes the ratio of the amount of energy in each mode to the total amount of energy in the beam and sink, where

Chapter 3 Targeted Energy Transfer Under Impact Excitation
In this chapter numerical analysis of the TET of the clamp-clamp Euler Bernoulli beam subjected to impact will be given. The system equations (2.8), (2.9) and (2.12) will be simulated for different impulse strength applied at various locations along the beam. Both time and frequency domain characterizations will be used to analyze the TET between the beam and the ES. They include the long-time energy dissipation in the ES, total energy in the beam and the ES, and the power spectral density (PSD) of the beam and ES. The main objective of the numerical experiment is to examine the effectiveness of the ES in achieving the TET. The results from the LES will be given to provide the contrast with the NES. All simulations are conducted using the scientific package MATLAB [18] and the numeric codes are listed in Appendix B. For the numerical simulations, the beam of dimensionless length L1 = 1, the mass per unit length 1  1 , damping coefficient  2  0.02 , and flexural rigidity EI =1 is considered. For both LES and NES, b1  0.2, b2  20 and b3  20 are used for the damping, linear and nonlinear stiffness coefficients, respectively. The dimensionless impulsive force is varied over the range

FI =10.5 to 40 in 0.5 increment. A sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz is used in all numerical
simulations and 200,000 data points are collected to calculate various energy terms defined in section 2.5. The primary mode of energy transfer is estimated from the PSD of the response. This is calculated using the periodogram and with a Hanning windowing to eliminate aliasing. To demonstrate energy transfer and its basic characteristics, results from NES based on an impact delivered at the mid-span of the beam D1 = 0.5 will first be discussed in section 3.1. Its linear counterpart given by the LES is presented in section 3.2. These sections show mainly time-domain characterization. In section 3.3, the frequency-domain method is used to provide further details of the underlying dynamics of the energy transfer process for different impact locations.

3.1.

Targeted Energy Transfer by the NES at D1 = 0.5

Figure 3.1 reveals the relationship between the energy dissipation by the LES and NES as a function of FI. It is seen that 35% to 75% energy dissipation is achievable by the NES. NES
14   

appears more advantageous than the LES for larger FI whereas LES is more beneficial of the system for low FI. To examine the dynamics that carry the energy transfer, the time history and PSD of the response from four cases are studied in detail. These cases are identified in Figure 3.1 as A, B, C and D. They correspond to FI = 10.5, 14.5, 18 and 23.5, respectively.

Figure 3.1: Energy dissipation by the NES and LES as a function of impact intensity.

Figures 3.2 and 3.3 show the response at FI  10.5 (point A in Figure 3.1). Figure 3.2b shows that the oscillation is concentrated initially in the first mode (Figure 3.2). But, after the transient period elapsed, most of the energy flowed into the 3rd mode (Figure 3.3c). Overall, it took   60 of dimensionless time for the NES to dissipate the energy (Figure 3.3d). In this case, only 36.5% input energy is dissipated by the NES (Figure 3.3e). When FI increases from 10.5 to 14.5 (point B in Figure 3.1), different dynamical behaviour is realized (Figures 3.4 and 3.5). At the beginning, NES is oscillating with small amplitude. The main difference is noticed in the NES response. In particular, NES exhibits faster oscillation as FI increases. Qualitatively, the energy flows among the modes and NES are similar to the FI =10.5 case. The residual energy is seen to remain mainly in the 3rd mode with a rather drastic transition compared to FI =10.5 case. Most energy transfer is seen to be completed after

  65 and it dissipates around 42% of input energy (Figures 3.5d and 3.5e).

17   

Moving towards the higher FI  18 (point C in Figure 3.1), qualitatively, similar dynamics is observed (Figure 3.6 and 3.7). NES continues the trend of moving towards the higher frequency oscillation. The energy transfer follows the same pattern as the previous case. Initially all the input impulse energy is in the beam then it flows back and forth between the beam and NES. Figure 3.7d shows that for   60 , 5% of the total energy still remains in the NES, but, after a while (  >80), this number starts to drop down to near 0%. In fact, this energy flows back to the beam where the third mode is capturing most of the energy (Figure 3.7c). For this case, around 42% of the input energy is dissipated by the NES (Figure 3.7e). Moving to the even higher energy FI  23.5 (see Figures 3.8, 3.9 and point D in Figure 3.1), the pattern of oscillations of the modes and NES, and the energy transfer contains the trend indicated in previous cases. Namely, NES oscillates at higher frequency and most residual energy remains primarily in the third mode. To gain better understanding of the underlying dynamics of the energy transfer, dominant Fourier mode in the PSD of the beam modes and NES are identified and compared. The PSD results from the cases discussed above have been shown in Figures 3.3f, 3.5f, 3.7f, and 3.9f. Here for each FI value, the frequency ratio (FR) between the dominant Fourier modes of the mode and NES recalculated and displayed in a FR Vs. FI diagram.
3.2. Targeted Energy Transfer by Linear Energy Sink

In this section, results from the LES are given. They are to provide the contrast with the performance of NES with the same parameter setting (section 3.1).

3.2.1. Simulation Results

To demonstrate, results used in section 3.1 from the same FI values are shown. Similar to NES, the dominant mode of energy transfer continues to be the first bending mode as it has the largest vibration amplitude. Compared to the NES, there is a more specific frequency ratio between the LES and the first bending mode. For example, there is clear 5:1 frequency ratio seen here compared to that in Figure 3.2b. In addition, all bending modes oscillate in their own resonance frequency whereas those of the NES case show more complicated pattern.

20   

In particular, the second mode exhibits beating characteristics in the NES case (Figure 3.2b), but not in LES case (Figure 3.10b). This implies more significant energy transfer in and out of the second mode in the NES case, albeit it is a very small proportion compared to that in the first mode. These characteristics are also reflected in the results from various energy measures. For example, residual energy portion in second mode is higher in NES than in LES. The PSDs confirm the more complicated dynamics in the NES than the LES case. However, for FI =10.5, more energy is dissipated by the LES (47% versus 36% in the NES). In addition, ELES (Figure 3.11e) rises faster than E NES (Figure 3.3e), suggesting a more efficient energy transfer for LES in the low FI range. Similar observations are made for other FI =14.5 (Figures 3.12, 3.13), 18 (Figures 3.14, 3.15) and 23.5 (Figures 3.16, 3.17). Namely, as expected the dynamics of the LES is much simpler compared to the NES. With regard to energy transfer pattern, the ELES ( ) in most cases rises faster than E NES ( ) for FI  23 , NES is able to dissipate energy much faster. This can be shown more clearly by the  (pNES ),  (pLES ) versus FI plot, where

 (pNES , LES ) is determined from E NES , LES ( (pNES , LES ) )  p (Figure 3.18).

3.3.

Dominant Frequency Components in TET

To gain better understanding of the underlying dynamics of the energy transfer, dominant Fourier modes of the beam and NES are identified from the PSD and compared. The PSD results from the cases discussed above have been shown in Figures 3.3f, 3.5f, 3.7f, and 3.9f. For each FI value the frequency ratio (FR) between the dominant Fourier modes of the beam and NES, LES are calculated. The results are displayed in a FR Vs. FI diagram.
3.3.1. Dominant Frequency Components in TET for Impact Location D1 = 0.5

To gain further understanding of the energy transfer between the beam and the ES, a frequency domain characterization is adopted. In particular, the frequency of the dominant Fourier modes of the beam and ES are first located and, then, compared to identify potential coupling. Such coupling can contain valuable information as it implies the dominant motion that carries the energy transfer between the beam and ES.

energy dissipation; (b) 15% energy dissipation; (c) 30% energy dissipation; (d) 45% energy dissipation. Figures 3.19 and 3.20 show the dominant frequencies as a function of FI for the case of
NES NES and LES. Of particular importance is the dominant frequency of the NES fD in TET and

its relationship with the dominant frequencies of the bending modes, fDBeam . For example, in
NES Figure 3.3f, two dominant frequencies fD ~ 0.89 (point A1) and f DNES 2 ~ 3.57 (point B1) are 1

identified. The Fourier amplitudes at these two frequencies are very close. It is seen
Beam ~ 3.57. that f DNES 2 matches well with the dominant frequency of the first bending modes, f D1

This result may follow intuitively in that most of the impact energy is captured by the first bending mode, which exhibits the largest amplitude of vibration (see, e.g., Figures 3.2a, 3.4a, 3.6a, and 3.8a). It is plausible that the main energy transfer should involve the first bending mode. This frequency coupling is found to persist in general for all the FI value. But for FI > 23.5
NES and f DNES (Figure 3.9f), a bifurcation pattern emerges where a third f DNES 3 appears between f D1 2 .

The results of Figure 3.19 can be summarized in Figure 3.21(c) where the dominant
Beam frequency ratio of the first bending mode and NES fD / fDNES 1 1, D 2 are shown. Frequency ratio

between NES and other bending modes is not considered since their Fourier amplitudes are generally orders of magnitude smaller, albeit they are physically coupled in the model.

3.3.2. Dominant Frequency Components in TET for Different Impact Locations

Detailed energy dissipation pattern of ENES, ELES, according to the impact locations are shown in Figure 3.22. The percent dissipation captured by these variables varies depending on how close the impact is delivered relative to the ES location (D = 0.4): higher percentage of dissipation is obtained when the impact is delivered closer to the ES location. A unique FI level appears to exist where ENES, LES begins to rise. Such a transition appears particularly sharp when the impact is applied at exactly the location of the ES (D = 0.4). In addition, ELES is independent of FI. This particular property can be shown using the linear system theory [17]. Briefly, both the energy dissipation by ES in the numerator and the input energy from the impact in the denominator of ELES, equation (2.32), can be expressed as linear functions of FI. The dependence of FI in LES is therefore cancelled out; see Appendix C for details. Similar to the case at D1 = 0.5 (sections 3.1, 3.2), the frequency-domain analysis at different impact locations continues to show the first bending mode being the dominant degreeof-freedom involving in the energy transfer with the ES. In contrast, the dominant Fourier modes of the other bending modes exhibit much smaller amplitudes of vibration. These results are summarized in Figures 3.21, and 3.23 through 3.26 for NES and Figures 3.27 through 3.30 for LES at D1 = 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.7, respectively. It is also observed that the underlying dynamics is more complex when the impact is applied away from the boundaries. In particular, more Fourier modes are excited when the impact is delivered around the mid-span area of the beam. The estimated FR in different impact locations has been summarized in Figure 3.21 for the NES and Figure 3.31 for the LES. Here, two FRs are provided based on the first two dominant Fourier
Beam , LES Beam , LES and FR2 = fD . For the NES, FR1 and FR2 modes of the ES: FR1 = fD / fDNES / fDNES 1 1 1 2

exhibit an initial drop for small FI before they appear to approach the "asymptotic" values FR1 ~ 3, FR2 ~ 1 for large FI; see also Figure 3.21. For the LES, the FR is constant: FR1 = 5, FR2 = 1 for all FI values. Note that energy transfer is more effective for larger FI values since ENES, ELES are larger. The corresponding FR1, FR2 values in this parameter range may therefore be significant. The estimated frequency ratios reported above may be observable from the oscillation of the first bending mode and the ES, granted it can be less obvious when it comes to the nonlinear response of NES. For example, shown in Figures 3.32 through 3.36 are samples of g1 ( ) and Y ( ) for NES and Figures 3.37 through 3.41 for the LES with FI = 10.5, 14.5, 18, 23.5 and D1 =
28   

0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7, respectively. A decreasing FR can be observed in Figures 3.32 through 3.36 over the same 5-sec period, there are roughly 3 cycles of Y ( ) for FI = 10.5 and this number increases to approximately 8 cycles for FI = 18. When examined closely, it is also seen at a high frequency component that appears to oscillate in 1:1 synchronization with g1 ( ) . For LES, there is a very clear 5:1 frequency ratio between g1 ( ) and Y ( ) : over the same 5-sec period, there is roughly 17.5 cycles of g1 ( ) and 3.5 cycles of Y ( ) . Similar to the NES case, the high frequency component in Y ( ) that exhibits 1:1 synchronization with g1 ( ) is also discernable. These counts verify the FR1 = 5 and FR2 = 1 estimates from Figures 3.27 through 3.30.

Chapter 4 Targeted Energy Transfer Under Periodic Excitation
In this chapter numerical analysis of the TET under periodic excitation will be given. In this work, a cosine function of dimensionless amplitude Fp and forcing frequency  is used to simulate the periodic force applied to the beam at X  D1 . The dimensionless beam and ES equations introduced in equation (2.6), (2.8) and (2.9) will be simulated over a selected range of D1 and  . The simulated modal and ES responses will then be used to calculate the average energy dissipation by the ES, total energy in the beam and ES for each cycle.

With the harmonic forcing function, the dimensionless beam equation (2.6) becomes
W XXXX   1W   2W  F ES ( ) ( X  D )  F p cos   ( X  D1 ). `

The simulation is conducted based on the fixed Fp  15 for   0.5 ~ 21 Hz, with 0.5 Hz increment, and D1 = 0.3 ~ 0.7, with 0.1 increment. To ensure the steady state is reached, 400,000 data points are simulated and the last 200,000 data points are used to calculate the relevant energy terms. For the periodic forcing, the energy transfer is characterized on the cycle-to-cycle bases. Here, the energy terms introduced in section (2.5) are modified accordingly,

dimensionless time segments in the steady state period. The energy dissipation in ES is modified similarly,

In addition, the energy ratio is defined to characterize the energy dissipation of the ES per total energy of the beam, R1 
E NES , LES . ET beam

The results of these energy quantities are given in Figures 4.1~4.5. As expected, the data indicate that most of the energy remains in the resonance mode of the beam when the forcing frequency lies in the neighborhood of the natural frequencies. Multi-modal vibration appears more prevalent when the forcing frequency lies in between the natural frequencies of the beam (Figures 4.1a~4.5a). But such a frequency range also defines a neighborhood where the ES can be less effective. In particular, R1, which measures the ratio of the dissipated energy by ES and the total beam energy can drop significantly (Figures 4.1c~4.5c). (Note that the results shown in these figures are in logarithmic scale.) For example, R1 drops significantly in the frequency neighborhoods around f   7.5 Hz and f   21 Hz at D1 = 0.3. As D1 increases, the drop around
f  begins to diminish, while the drop around f  persists with f   21 Hz at D1 = 0.3 and f   15.5 Hz at D1 = 0.7.

The overall effectiveness of the ES appears to be minimal. For example, only R1  e5 is reached in all cases. However, the performance of the ES appears quite "uniform" in that R1 in selected frequency range does not show large variation. The frequencies ranges are mostly found in the neighbourhood of the resonance frequency. The location of the applied periodic force D1 can affect the location as well as the length of such frequency ranges. In particular, such frequency range is widened as the periodic force moves towards the center portion of the beam.

Chapter 5 Discussions, Conclusion and Future Works
5.1. Discussions and Conclusion

Numerical results of the targeted energy transfer between the Euler-Bernoulli beam and ES are presented. Both NES and LES are considered for the beam under impact and periodic excitations. The investigation was focused on the effectiveness of the TET by varying the location of the excitation, the impact strength and the forcing amplitude and frequency of the periodic excitation. Other interesting and equally important parameters, including the ES location D, ES parameters, b1 (dimensionless damping coefficient), b2 (dimensionless linear stiffness coefficient), b3 (dimensionless nonlinear stiffness coefficient), and the beam parameters, CC (dimensionless damping coefficient), CK (dimensionless stiffness coefficient), were held fixed and their effects were not examined. To determine the interesting parameter range is part of the challenge of the investigation. In this work, weak damping is considered. This is aimed at allowing the resonance modal interaction to be the primary contributor to the underlying energy transfer. While intuition would suggest more energy dissipation with a higher damping, it is plausible that the "signature" of the resonance mode vibration may become less obvious. Nevertheless, this, as well as other parameters, would be the part of the considerations intended for the future work. The main observation of the numerical results is the predominant role of the first bending mode in the TET with the ES. This is consistently observed in the impact and periodic forcing excitations, and is independent of the location of the applied force. Given the particular geometrical fixed-fixed boundary condition used in the present study, and the fact that only one excitation force is applied, it is a reasonable outcome since the first bending mode is more likely excited than the higher order modes. For the impact excitation, the effectiveness of the LES in TET as measured by the ELES is independent of the impulsive force magnitude FI. This result can be verified based on the linear system theory (Appendix C). But for NES, the results from ENES indicated that a threshold FI value exists, beyond which more efficient energy transfer can be achieved. The effectiveness of the TET appears to depend on the relative locations between the applied force and the ES

45   

location: the farther away the applied force from the ES, the less effective is the NES. For example, the largest value of ENES (>80%) is reached when the applied force is exactly located at the attachment site of the NES. The same FI threshold discussed above also affects the time
( NES ) ( NES ) can drop significantly for larger FI period for the energy dissipation,  % p . In particular,  % p ( LES ) is again independent of FI since ELES is independent of FI. Given any value. For the LES,  % p ( NES , LES ) varies with the location of the applied force: a much % p, the threshold value for the  % p

shorter time to achieve % p dissipation when the applied force is closer to the ES. Further
( NES , LES ) understanding of  % can be of practical interest for the design of ES since it reflects how p

efficient the ES can be for the TET. In an attempt to understand the underlying modal interaction, the dominant Fourier modes in the vibrations of the beam and the ES are extracted directly from the PSD calculations. Since the dynamics of the LES is independent of FI, the dominant Fourier modes change only for the NES case. Two specific frequency ratios, FR1 and FR2, are used to summarize the modal interaction between the first bending mode and the NES. An initial drop of these ratios can be observed for small FI. Interestingly, an "asymptotic" FR1 ~ 3, FR2 ~ 1 are observed for large FI. This implies the modal interaction between the beam and the NES remained unchanged when the impulsive force is large. For the periodic excitation given by the harmonic function, three major observations were made. First, the ratio, R1, which measures the energy dissipation relative to the amount of total energy in the beam, exhibits relatively small variation across a wide forcing frequency range. Secondly, there exist particular frequency windows where R1 can drop significantly. It is found that both the width of these frequency windows as well as the location on the frequency axis vary with the forcing location. Once again, the variation appears to depend on the relative locations between the ES and the applied force: the closer the applied force is to the attachment site of the ES, the less pronounced the change is seen in the R1 ratio. The last observation is that the poor performance of the ES when it comes to energy dissipation on the cycle-to-cycle basis. For example, for D = 0.4 and D1 = 0.4, R1 only reaches approximately ~ e0.5.

Recommendations for Future Work

While the preliminary investigation has uncovered several interesting features in the TET between the Euler-Bernoulli beam and the ES, there is still a large parameter space to explore. In particular, the following future research works may be considered.  Numerical simulations should be expanded with a broader consideration of other system parameters. In addition to those mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the location of the ES attachment site, different material properties are also of importance when it comes to the design and vibration control of eliminating unwanted vibration. In addition, numerical analysis using more bending modes may be necessary when nonlinear effect of the beam vibration is considered.  Analytical study of the underlying Hamiltonian system will add new insights to the underlying dynamics of TET between beam type structure and ES. The analysis can lead to the identification of specific periodic orbits of the NES, the so-called the nonlinear normal modes (NNM), and their coupling with the vibration of the beam. The understanding of the dynamics of the NNM allows a more detail examination of the so-called resonance capture in the TET process.  It is of interest to further explore the dynamics of the NES in the chaotic regime. From the attachment site, NES is directly driven by the dynamics of the beam. For the Euler-Bernoulli beam, chaos is less likely since the beam is only capable of "simple" harmonic oscillation. Future work should include nonlinear elements in the primary structure so as to explore the effect of chaotic dynamics in the TET process. Given the sensitivity of the chaotic dynamics and the stability of the dynamic regime, it is plausible that more efficient and effective TET can be achieved.

C.1 Energy dissipation by the LES due to impulsive force

It is possible to show the independence of the ELES with the impulsive force FI. First, let Yl, l = 1, ..., N be the solution of the differential equation

velocity components vary as linear functions of FI. Following (2.32), ELES is therefore independent of FI, since the impact energy in the denominator also varies as a linear function of FI.
