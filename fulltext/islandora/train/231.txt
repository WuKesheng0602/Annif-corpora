INDUCED HEATING IN STEEL-BEAM REINFORCED CEILINGS OVER THREE-PHASE TRANSFORMER DELTA CLOSURES

P.F.Ryff, Senior Member, IEEE Ryerson Polytechnical Institute Department of Electrical Technology Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Abstract - Due to eddy currents, high temperatures often occur in structural parts adjacent to conductors carrying large currents. This paper deals with this problem and specifically with the minimum safe height and orientation of steel beams in a reinforced concrete ceiling above a three-phase transformer delta closure, The power losses in the steel members due to induced eddy currents are calculated, from whichthetemperature increases are determined, properly accounting for convection and radiation effects. The methods presented are substantiated by experimental data and applied toa practical

design1. Hence, to evaluate critical designparameters and to maintain any induced heating well within this lower temperature limit and possibly tolevels not to exceed those existing before upgrading (which werequiteacceptable), this investigation was initiated. Particular emphasize was placed on determining the new ceiling height and steel beam orientation with respect to the current conductors, in view of induced heating and minimizing local surface temperatures. After presentation of thegeneral theory and verification of calculated results by experimental data, the theory is applied to the practical installation considered.
FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM
The configuration examined is illustrated in figure 1, showing the secondary bus bars connecting the flexible cables to the threephase transformer secondary terminals. The reinforced ceiling and the to - be - determined distance d, with respect to the center phase, is also shown. The bus bars (two per phase) protrude through the furnace transformer wall in a triangulated manner, as shown in figure 2. For analytical treatment two extreme and distinct situations are considered. Inthe first one, the steel structural beams run perpendicular to the secondary bus bars, while in the

INTRODUCTION The remarkable increases in power levels during the last few years of electric arc furnaces, used in steel-producing plants, also has produced many new problems. Not the least of them has been the heating of building steel adjacent to conductors carrying currents of up to 100 kA, in the event of Ultra High Power (UHP) furnace operation. Current ratings of existing furnaces being upgraded are increased by as much as 100 percent, sometimes without giving due regard to adjacent structural steel. One such instance, to be reported in this paper, was the question of proper spacing of a yetto-be-constructed reinforced concrete ceiling structure above a three- phase transformer delta closure as found inelectric arc furnace installations. In the upgrading of the furnace steel output capacity, which among many other

furnace transformer, the current levels were increased from 50 kA to 80 kA. It became apparent that with these increased currents, greater consideration of induced heating effects in nearby structural steel was essential. In addition to the economic value in minimizing these heating effects, there is also the question of stresses resulting from localized heating and the effects on the strength of
the concrete and the bond between concrete and steel. Although the American Concrete Institute states that the strength and life of portland concrete is not inversely affected by temperatures as high as 120-260 °C, the bond between steel and concrete cycling at these elevated temperatures may well impose constraints on the

Calculation Temperature Temperature__Calculation Having determined the power loss density throughout the material region in both cases, the corresponding temperature effect remains to be found. For this the induced power loss density at the surface where the temperature is to be calculated is obtained by the methods presented.

It can be seen in both instances that they compare very well, thereby substantiating the theories presented. At the smaller distances it canbe seen that the results of the two methods converge, as expected, since even in the event of a single to beam its dimensions become large compared the distances involved. It is also interesting for the to note that the calculated results single beam are somewhat smaller and for the plate somewhat larger than the experimental results, respectively. For the ceiling consisting of a plate it is as expected. However, for the single beam these small deviations are expected to be caused by slight variations in material constants used in the calculations.

Therefore, to maintain the induced losses (and subsequent temperature increases) at the increased current levels to those existing before upgrading, it was recommended to run beams in parallel to the secondary bus-bars at a minimum ceiling height of 7-6" . The new ceiling presently-being installed is constructed according to these recommendations.

Actual Installation
The existing installation as depicted in figures 1 and 2, has the secondary bus-bars in a triangulated geometry measuring 4'-1" , the current per phase is 60 kA. The two busses per phase are spaced at 9.75" with a ceiling height of 6'-6" above the center-phase. The construcand tional beams are in a parallel geometry widely spaced compared to the dimensions in question. Using the method for the parallel geometry the surface temperatures were calculated for a range of distances, shown in figure 8, by curve i. The maximum measured temperature (actual temperature will fluctuate depending on the particular "load' condition in the furnace) was approximately 35 OC , being close to the predicted value at the distance involved.
