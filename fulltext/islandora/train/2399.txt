Abstract
A FINITE ELEMENT FORMULATION OF ACTIVE CONSTRAINED-LAYER FUNCTIONALLY GRADED BEAM © Ry Long, 2010 Master of Applied Science in the Program of Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University Active constrained-layer damping (ACLD) treatment is the combination of passive and active features in the control of structural vibrations. A three-layer structure that consists of a functionally graded (FG) host beam, with a bonded viscoelastic layer and a constraining piezoelectric fiber-reinforce composite (PFRC) laminate is modeled and analyzed. The assumptions for modeling the system are the application of Timoshenko beam theory for the host beam and PFRC laminate, and a higher-order beam theory for the viscoelastic layer. The formulation is assumed to have field variables that are expressed as polynomials through the thickness of the structure and linear interpolation across the span. The extended Hamilton's principle is utilized to determine the system equations of motion, which are then solved using the Newmark time-integration scheme. Many support conditions such as fullyand partially-clamped cantilevered, partially clamped-clamped and simply-supported are analyzed. The effects of ply angle orientation, as well as FG properties, are also carefully examined.

1.1 Background

Recent advances in design and manufacturing of composite structures have significantly enhanced their use in various applications including aerospace, automotive and civil industries. Machines and structures subjected to dynamic loading experience vibration, which, if unattended, could cause serious problems, lead to energy loss, material fatigue, noise and other failures. In order to achieve the best design with desirable performance, it is necessary to control the vibration, especially for lightweight structures. The successful reduction of vibration and noise will cause the structures to operate under lower stress levels, offering better performance and longer life. A considerable amount of research has been done over the years with regard to the modeling and control of lightweight composite structures. The methods to overcome structural instability and to eliminate noise due to vibration include the isolation of the system from the source of vibration, the redesign of the system, the attachment of masses, and the applications of damping treatments to the structure [1]. This thesis is about the addition of damping, which is typically the most appropriate method of suppressing vibration of randomly excited structures that are governed by resonant modes [1]. Generally, for thin-walled structures such as beams, cylinders, and plates, layers of materials are added to dissipate more energy. There are distinctively two structural types of damping treatments, free-layer (unconstrained) and constrained layer damping (CLD) treatments. Free-layer damping treatments only refer to passive damping treatments, while CLD treatments consists of both passive and active damping treatments, also known as passive constrained layer damping (PCLD) and active constrained layer damping (ACLD), respectively [1]. Unconstrained damping methods consist of the bonding of a passive viscoelastic layer to the outer surface of the host structure (Figure 1.1a). The viscoelastic layer is considered 1

passive due to its inability to respond to the system. It is subjected to both direct and shear strain caused by its damping layer, resulting in energy dissipation. Damping treatments based on employing direct strain should attach the damping layer furthest from the neutral axis since this location experiences the longest direct strains. If a second layer, a so-called constraining layer, is bonded to the damping layer (viscoelastic material), the multi-layered beam is known as a passive constrained layer damped (PCLD) treatment as depicted in Figure 1.1b. The attachment of the constraining layer induces increased considerable shear stresses to the damping layer. Typically, the constraining layer in PCLD is made of an elastic material. PCLD treatments have been widely used to solve vibration problems in automotive, computer hardware, military, and aerospace industry [1]. These vibration solutions have led to many applications such as inlet guide vanes of jet engines, helicopter cabins, exhaust stacks, satellite structures, equipment panels, antenna structures, truss systems, and space stations, etc. [7].

Conversely, if an active element in the form of a piezoelectric material is attached to the passive viscoelastic material, it is known as an active constrained layer damped (ACLD) treatment. ACLD treatment is illustrated in Figure 1.1c. Here a sensor senses the vibrations of the structure and drives the piezoelectric actuator through a control system, enhancing the shear in the viscoelastic material. ACLD treatments are superior to PCLD treatments since they facilitate the control of low-frequency modes [1]. Additionally, ACLD treatments have the ability to adapt to changing environment in the structure. As a result of this adaptability, these structures are also considered as `smart' or `intelligent' structures.

1.1.1

Classical Three-Layer Theory

The classical theory is a commonly used theory for the analysis of a composite beams that focuses on the behavior of each individual layer. The assumptions which support the classical three-layer theory [2, 3, 4] are: 1. the host beam and the constraining layer deform as Euler-Bernoulli beams, that is, plane cross sections remain plane and perpendicular to the deflection curve of the deformed beam, 2. the viscoelastic core behaves as a Timoshenko beam, 3. the axial displacement field in each layer is linear through the thickness and the transverse displacement is constant throughout the thickness, 4. the core supports only shear load, 5. perfect bonding exists at the interfaces and no slip occurs between the layers, 6. in-plane inertia effects are ignored, 7. small-displacement theory is applicable. To improve the model, shear and longitudinal energy contributions of the core will be considered as well as shear deformation in the top and bottom layers. To capture the shear contributions, the formulation in this thesis is based on a higher order beam theory for the core and Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theory for the top and bottom layers.

1.2

Research Objectives

In the past, research has been done on the vibration analysis of an ACLD beam where the structure consisted of an elastic host beam as the base, a viscoelastic damping layer 3

as the core and piezoelectric layer on top [6, 8]. A functionally graded (FG) host beam and a piezoelectric fiber reinforced composite (PFRC) top layer were adopted by Miroshnichenko [3]. The present work extends the model of an active constrained layer damping treatment with more representations of the FG host beam and PFRC top layer developed by Miroshnichenko. In Ref. [3], the author modeled the beam using the quasi-2D finite element formulation, whereas the present work uses a more simplified finite element formulation with the same quasi-2D concept. Additionally, it was assumed in Ref. [3] that the longitudinal displacement of both the host beam and core layer can be represented as cubic functions in the thickness coordinate, while their transverse displacements were quadratic functions. The longitudinal displacement of the top layer was modeled as a linear function in the thickness coordinate and the transverse displacement was constant. In this thesis, however, both the host beam and top layer are modeled using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The new modeling of the viscoelastic core follows the formulation of a higher-oder beam theory wherein the transverse and axial displacements are interpolated linearly and cubicly in the thickness coordinate, respectively. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the ACLD beam using the proposed simplified quasi-2D formulation and compare it to the classical theory. The ACLD beam consists of a FG host beam, a viscoelastic core, and a PFRC top layer. Also, the effects of different representations of the FG beam with respect to Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density are investigated. The numerical simulations are performed in MATLAB.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1 Active Constrained-Layer Damping ACLD

Active constrained-layer damping treatments (ACLD) have been examined to enhance the damping aptitude of the classical passive constrained-layer damping treatments (PCLD). Stanway et al. [1] discussed the progression from PCLD to ACLD, where a piezoelectric layer acts as the constraining layer. ACLD treatments greatly increase performance by enabling vibration control at low frequencies. With this advancement from PCLD to ACLD, vibration can now be controlled at both the high modes and low modes due to the passive and active elements, respectively. The elements of ACLD work in tandem in such a way that the active elements allow structures to adapt to changing environment and the passive elements provide a fail-safe mechanism. The active element consists of an actuator, usually in the form of a piezoelectric layer, which increases the beam's deformation. This, therefore, enhances the damping capability of the viscoelastic layer [1, 8, 9, 10]. Many researchers have been investigating the applications of ACLD treatments and their advantages in vibration control. Balamurugan and Narayanan [8] examined the development of a beam finite element model that has been partially covered with the ACLD treatment. Gao et al. [9] analyzed a simply-supported beam with enhanced self-sensing constrainedlayer (ECLD) treatments. The effect of edge element stiffness in ECLD on the sensing ability, loss factor and modal frequencies of the system were examined. The ECLD consisted of edge elements that were connected to both the host structure and piezoelectric layer for the purpose of transmissibility between the sensor and actuator. In [1], Stanway et al. highlighted practical applications of ACLD. They presented various actuator and sensor configurations that have been investigated by other researchers and also discussed the development of some modeling and control techniques. Trindade et al. [10] described numerous hybrid damping treatments, geometric configurations, modeling approaches and control algorithms of beams 5

used in the literature. They also performed a thorough comparative analysis regarding the different hybrid active-passive damping configurations of other literature.

2.2

Piezoelectric Element as Actuator and Sensor

The piezoelectric element has both direct and inverse effects that enable its use as an actuator or a sensor. The direct effect is defined as the generation of an electric charge in proportion to an applied force, and the inverse effect induces an expansion or contraction under an applied electric field. Hence, a simplified ACLD configuration is developed with the benefit of the dual nature of the piezoelectric element as a self-sensing actuator [1, 9, 10]. A distinctive configuration that was examined by both Stanway et al. [1] and Trindade et al. [10], comprised of an elastic beam, a viscoelastic core, and a piezoelectric actuator as the constraining layer with a sensor that was bonded to the treatment. This thesis employs an ACLD arrangement that is similar to this configuration (presented in both Refs. [1] and [10]), where an accelerometer is used to measure the tip velocity of the beam and then fed into the controller of the system. The controller then sends a signal to excite the piezoelectric actuator. A schematic of the configuration is shown in Figure 2.1.

Materials

The present three-layer system consists of a host beam that is made of functionally graded material (FGM), with a bonded constraining viscoelastic layer and a piezoelectric fiberreinforced composite (PFRC) that covers the viscoelastic layer. Each material and its properties are described in the following subsections.

2.3.1

Functionally Graded Material (FGM) Beam

Functionally graded materials (FGMs) consist of two or more material components whose relative volume fractions and microstructures are engineered to have gradually varying properties. FGMs are not like laminates which have sudden transition in material properties across the interface between distinct materials. This abrupt change in material properties can result in delamination due to large interlaminar stresses, and the initiation and propagation of cracks because of large plastic deformation at the interfaces [12]. FGMs are able overcome these adverse effects since they are engineered to have a smooth spatial variation of material properties. During the past decade a large amount of research has been done to analyze the behavior of FGMs. For example, Amarani et al. [13] presented a free vibration analysis on a cantilevered sandwich beam with a functionally graded (FG) core. The Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density varied in the thickness following the power-law or rule of mixture technique. The element-free Galerkin method and standard Galerkin formulation for two dimensional elasticity problems were considered. Rahmani et al. [14] also studied the free vibration of sandwiched beams with a flexible functionally graded syntactic core. A new model based on high-order sandwich panel theory was implemented. The formulations consisted of the classical beam theory for the face sheets and an elasticity theory for the FG core. It was concluded that increasing the inhomogeneity of the core led to higher natural frequencies of the beam modes. Apetre et al. [15] performed an impact response of a sandwich beam with functionally graded core. The variation of the Young's modulus of the core was represented by a polynomial in the thickness coordinate, but the Poisson's ratio was kept constant. A combination of Fourier analysis and Galerkin method was used to solve the system governing equations. The core thicknesses of the FG core were chosen such that the flexural stiffness of the sandwich beam were equal to that of the beam with a homogeneous core. The results indicate that functionally graded cores can be used effectively to mitigate or avoid impact damage in sandwich structures. Ray and Sachade [12] derived the exact solution for the static analysis of FG plates integrated with a PFRC layer. The Young's modulus of the FG plate was assumed to vary exponentially across the thickness of the plate, while the Poisson's ratio was constant over the domain of the plate. The through-the-thickness behavior of the plates revealed bendingextension coupling in the FG plates even if the PFRC layer is not subjected to an applied voltage. In this thesis, the Poisson's ratio , density  , and Young's modulus E vary throughout the thickness of the beam. Two different functions of FGMs are investigated: power-law 7

functions (P-FGM), and exponential functions (E-FGM). In Ref. [17], the E-FGM function and P-FGM function are respectively interpreted as: G(z ) = G2 e(z+h) where the functional material gradient is given as  = 1 ln(G1 /G2 ), and 2h (2.2) (2.1)

G(z ) = f (z )G1 + [1 - f (z )]G2 The volume fraction obeying the power-law is: f (z ) = z+h 2h
p

(2.3)

where p is the material parameter and 2h is the thickness of the plate or beam. G1 and G2 are the specified material property at the bottom (z = -h) and top surfaces (z = h) of the FGM plate or beam, respectively.

2.3.2

Viscoelastic Material

Viscoelastic materials are often incorporated into light/flexible structures to reduce structural vibrations and noise. There are numerous techniques associated with incorporating viscoelastic materials into structures. A viscoelastic solid has a weak frequency dependence on its dynamic properties over an extensive frequency range [18]. The Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) model is a method used for time-domain analysis of viscoelastic analysis of viscoelastic structures [8]. In Ref. [19], the Prony series method, a classical time-based technique for fitting creep or relaxation data in the form of exponential functions, is compared to a fractional derivative model. The fractional derivative model is another time-domain method which is based on fractional calculus. It is not commonly used in commercial finite element software such as ANSYS, which employs the Prony series method. The reason for this is most likely due to the increased mathematical difficulty even though it is a better viscoelastic modeling technique. This thesis uses a four-parameter fractional derivative model to analyze the ACLD beam. Over the last two decades, the concept of fractional derivative has become an extremely effective device to describe the weak frequency dependence of most viscoelastic materials [18]. Galucio et al. [18] showed that the complex modulus of a one-dimensional model can be written as: d (t) d  (t)  = E ( t ) +  E (2.4)  (t) +   0  dt dt 8

where  and are the stress and the strain, E0 and E are the relaxed and instantaneous elastic moduli, and  is the relaxation time. A Fourier transformation of Eq. 2.4 yields the elastic complex modulus: E  ( ) = E0 + E (i )   ( ) =  ( ) 1 + (i ) (2.5)

where   and  are the Fourier transforms of  (t) and (t), respectively; E0 = E  (  0) represents the static modulus of elasticity; E = E  (  ) is the dynamic modulus;  is the relaxation time; and  is the fractional derivative order. To fulfill the second law of thermodynamics, the conditions 0 <  < 1,  > 0 and E > E0 must hold.

2.3.3

Piezoelectric Fiber-Reinforced Composite (PFRC)

Piezoelectric materials have been extensively used as sensors and/or actuators and when merged into a high-performance lightweight smart structure, they actively control vibration. Piezoelectric sensors and/or actuators are either mounted on or embedded in the structure, enabling them to have self-controlling and self-monitoring capabilities. Even though piezoelectric materials play a major role in achieving active damping in structures, they possess low control authority because their monolithic piezoelectric stress/strain constants are quite small in magnitude [20]. Since the active damping of these structures are dependent on the piezoelectric stress/strain constants, modifications to these properties are desirous in order to improve their damping characteristics. Piezoelectric composites are effective in improving flexural vibration control if their fibers are longitudinally oriented to execute a bending mode of actuators. The fibers are subjected to a constant electric field in the direction transverse to the fiber direction, wherein the electric field is assumed to be the same for both the fibers and the matrix [20, 12]. The schematic diagram of a lamina made of PFRC is shown in Figure 2.2.

9

Figure 2.2: Schematic diagram of a lamina made of PFRC [20].

Investigations that include the implementation of PFRCs in the high-performance lightweight structures were performed by Mallik and Ray [20], and Ray and Sachade [12]. The former showed that the effective piezoelectric coefficient becomes significantly larger than the corresponding coefficient of the piezoelectric material of the fiber. The authors were able to determine the effectiveness based on a specific fiber volume fraction by using a micromechanical analysis. In Ref. [12], Ray and Sachade derived the exact solutions for the static analysis of FG plates integrated with a layer of PFRC material. They showed that the activated PFRC layer was more effective in controlling the deformations of the FG plates when the layer was attached to the surface of the FG plate the minimum stiffness rather than that with the maximum stiffness. The inverse and direct constitutive equations of the PFRC material with respect to plane co-ordinates (xyz ) are given as [21]:

Chapter 3 Theoretical Formulation
3.1 System Description

The system being analyzed is a rectangular three-layered composite beam. The host beam is made of FGM with through-the-thickness varying material properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density). The FGM beam is bonded to a viscoelastic material whose other side is bonded to a PFRC laminate layer. Figure 3.1 is a schematic of the ACLD beam arrangement where a sensor measures the tip velocity, which is then fed through the controller to obtain a voltage that is applied to the PFRC laminate. The bottom layer, represented by the host beam which is an FGM beam, is identified by the subscript b. The core layer, made of viscoelastic material, is distinguished by the subscript c. The top layer, representing the PFRC laminate, is identified by the subscript t with n number of plies. Each PFRC ply has unidirectional fibers aligned at an angle  with respect to the reference axis. The geometric parameters of the ACLD beam are the length of the beam L, width of the beam b, thickness of the bottom layer (host beam) 2hb , thickness of the core layer (viscoelastic layer) 2hc , and thickness of the top layer (PFRC laminate) 2ht . Each layer has its own axes where zb , zc , and zt are zero at the midsurface of each layer. The material properties of the ith layer are density i , Young's Modulus Ei , and Poisson's ratio i . Perfect bonding is assumed at each interface where the adhesive material is thin with infinite stiffness.

3.2.1

FGM Beam (Bottom Layer)
Kinematic Assumptions

The FGM beam has an axial displacement that is linearly interpolated across the beam thickness and a through-the-thickness independent transverse displacement represented by ¯b is written as: u ¯b and w ¯b , respectively. The displacement vector of the FGM beam d ¯b = d u ¯b (x, zb , t) w ¯b (x, zb , t) = ub (x, t) - zb b (x, t) wb (x, t) (3.1)

b (x,t) This kinematic assumption captures Euler-Bernoulli beam theory if, b (x, t) = wx . The reference point is taken at the geometric midpoint of the FGM beam. Defining a new ¯ vector uT b = {ub wb b } gives the following expansion of db :

¯b = d

    [Db ] =   0   0

3.2.2

Constitutive Equations

With respect to an orthotropic FGM where the principal material properties coincide with both x and z axes, the 2-dimensional stress-strain constitutive relations are:         c ( z ) c ( z ) 0 x 11 13    x   =  c11 (z ) c33 (z ) z 0  z       xz b 0 0 c55 (z ) xz     
b

(3.5)

where x and z are the normal stresses in the x and z directions, respectively, xz is the shear stress in the xz -plane and cij are elastic constants of the material. With the assumption c11 ¯11 = that stress in the z direction is zero (i.e. z = 0), then z = - x and introducing c c33 c13 2 (c11 - ), the reduced constitutive relation is written as: c33  ¯b = x xz =

 [Qb (z )] ¯b

(3.6)

For varying Young's modulus, the elasticity matrix may be written as: [Qb (z )] = Eb (z ) [b ] = Eb (z ) (1 + b )(1 - 2b ) 1 - b 0 0 (1 - 2b )/2 (3.7)

where Eb (z ) is the elastic function that varies throughout the thickness and [b ] is the coefficient matrix. The isotropic elasticity matrix is related to the Young's modulus Eb and Poisson's ratio b and is under plane strain assumption. b can either be constant or vary along z (i.e. b = b (z )). Depending on the application, the FGM beam may have its Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and/or density varying continuously in the thickness direction, along the z -axis (i.e. E = E (z ),  =  (z ),  = (z )). The formulation for two types of volume fraction methods: 1) power-law FGM (P-FGM) and 2) exponential FGM (E-FGM) may be written as: 1) In P-FGM the volume fraction is assumed to obey the power-law function: f (z ) = z+h 2h
p

(3.8)

where p is the material parameter and 2h is the thickness of the layer. The rule of mixture is applied with the volume fraction f (z ) to determine the effective material property.
1 G(z ) = f (z )G0 b + [1 - f (z )]Gb

(3.9)

2) In E-FGM the volume fraction obeys the exponential function:
(z +h) G(z ) = G0 be

where G(z) represents any varying property (i.e. G(z ) = E = E (z ), G(z ) =  =  (z ), or 1 G(z ) =  = (z )). G0 b and Gb represent the corresponding material properties at the bottom and top surfaces of the FGM beam, respectively, and  is a parameter that describes the inhomogeneity of the FGM beam throughout the thickness. Thus, from Eqs. 3.9 and 3.10, the FGM elasticity, Poisson ratio and density equations for both P-FGM and E-FGM become: 1) P-FGM p p z+h z+h 0 1 E b (z ) = Eb + 1- Eb (3.12) 2h 2h 14

Variational Formulation using Hamilton's principle

The equation of motion is derived by utilizing the extended Hamilton's principle: (T - U + W )dt = 0

(3.18)

where T (= Tb + Tc + Tt ) and U (= Ub + Uc + Ut ) are the variations of the kinetic energy and strain energy, respectively. W is the virtual work done by external forces on the system. 3.2.3.1 Kinetic Energy

where b is either constant or varying (i.e. b = b (z )) with respect to P-FGM method (Eq.

3.14) or E-FGM method (Eq. 3.17). For a constant density, the inertia matrix [Ib ] becomes:  1 0 -zb    0 1 0  dz 2 -zb 0 zb  [Ib ] =

If the density is varying through the thickness, it must be integrated with the inertia matrix with respect to z (i.e. z b [Zb ]T [Zb ] dz ). 3.2.3.2 Strain Energy

(3.29)

where x and z are the normal stresses in the x and z directions, respectively, xz is the shear stress in the xz -plane and cij are elastic constants of the material. For an isotropic material and under plane strain assumption, the elasticity matrix can be written as: [Qc ] = Ec [c ] 19 (3.30)

where  1 - c c 0 1   [c ] = 1 - c 0  c  (1 + c )(1 - 2c ) 0 0 (1 - 2c )/2 3.3.2.2 Viscoelastic Properties  (3.31)

The mechanical behavior of the viscoelastic material at any given time depends on the current state of stress and strain as well as on the full history of the material. Following Galucio et al. [18], the constitutive relation can be mathematically described by a two-dimensional constitutive equation as:  ¯c (t) +   d  ¯c (t) d ¯c (t)  = E [  ] ¯ ( t ) +  E [  ] 0 c c  c dt dt (3.32)

where [c ] is the same as Eq. 3.31, which assumes a plane strain condition, E0 and E are the relaxed and non-relaxed elastic moduli,  is the relaxation time, and  is the fractional d derivative order (0 <  < 1). The fractional operator  is approximated by the Gr¨ unwald dt definition by finite difference as: d f (t)  t- dt
Nt

Aj +1 f (t - j t)
j =0

(3.33)

t is the time step increment, Nt is the total number of terms where Nt < N , where t = N and Aj +1 are the Gr¨ unwald coefficients given by the recurrence formula: Aj +1 j--1 p--1 = Aj = j p p=1
j

(3.34)

The anelastic strain ¯c at a specific time t can be written as: ¯c (t) = ¯c (t) - [c ]-1  ¯c E (3.35)

This allows the constitutive equation, Eq. 3.32 to be rewritten as: ¯c (t) +
  d ¯c (t)  dt

=

E - E0 ¯c (t) E

(3.36)

This change in variable simplifies the equation by reducing the number of fraction derivative terms from two to one. Employing the Gr¨ unwald approximation from Eq. 3.33 and noting 20

that A1 = 1, Galucio at al. [18] showed that Eq. 3.35 gives the following form: E - E0 ¯c (t) = (1 -  ) ¯c (t) -  E where  =

(3.37)

 is a dimensionless constant.   + t A contrived anelastic displacement vector {uc (t)} is expressed such that the anelastic strain can be written as: ¯c (t) = Zc [Dc ] uc (t) (3.38)

Substituting ¯c (t) from Eq. 3.28 and ¯c (t) from Eq. 3.38 at a specific time t into Eq. 3.37, the anelastic displacement becomes: E - E0 uc (t) -  uc (t) = (1 -  ) E Isolating  ¯c (t) from Eq. 3.35 yields:  ¯c (t) = E [c ] ¯c (t) - ¯c (t) (3.40)

PFRC Laminate (Top Layer)

The piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC) is identified with the subscript t for the top layer. The PFRC layer acts as an actuator for the ACLD beam.

3.4.1
3.4.1.1

Kinematic Assumptions
Mechanical Field Assumptions

Similar to the FGM beam bottom layer, the axial displacement is linearly interpolated in the thickness coordinate and the transverse displacement is constant. The displacement vector ¯t (includes both the axial u d ¯t and transverse w ¯t displacement) is written as: ¯t = d u ¯t (x, zt , t) w ¯t (x, zt , t) = ut (x, t) - zt t (x, t) wt (x, t) (3.51)

The reference point is taken at the geometric midpoint of the ply assembly or PFRC layer. ¯ Establishing a new vector uT t = {ut wt t } gives the following expansion of dt :

3.4.1.2

Electrical Field Assumptions

Two assumptions are made with respect to the electrostatic field in the PFRC laminate. The first assumption is that the electrical potential variable t is linear throughout the thickness of the top layer and is written as: t (x, zt , t) = 0 (x, t) + zt t (x, zt , t) zt (3.56)

t are the electric potential and its gradient at the mid-plane of the PFRC zt laminate, respectively. where 0 and 24

The second assumption is that the axial component of the electrical field (i.e. Ex = 0) is negligible since the contribution to the electromechanical energy is insignificant compared to the transverse displacement. In addition, the voltage is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the z direction (thickness) because the PFRC laminate is thin. The transverse constant electrical field Ez can then be expressed as: Ez = - V t =- zt ht (3.57)

where V is the applied voltage and ht is the PFRC laminate thickness.

3.4.2

Constitutive Equations

The piezoelectric fibers in the PFRC are continuous and unidirectional and subjected to a constant electric field transverse to the fibers. The matrix and fibers have identical electric field. Further, the matrix is not piezolectrically active [20]. 3.4.2.1 Mechanical Properties

The piezoelectric fibers are isotropic and lie in the transverse 1-2 plane. The constitutive relation for the k th ply of the PFRC in the principal 1-2-3 directions is given as:       c11 c12 c13 0 0 0   1          c12 c22 c23 0 2  0 0            c 0 0  13 c23 c33 0 3 =  0  23  0 0 c44 0 0          0   13  0 0 0 c55 0           0 0 0 0 0 c66 12 k     1       2        3    23       13        12 k                            -

(3.58) where i, j = 1, 2, 3, i and ij are the normal and shear stress, and i and ij are the normal and shear strain components. Also, cij 's are the effective elastic coefficients determined from the micromechanical analysis at constant electric field [20]. The constants eij represent the piezoelectric coefficients and Ei is the electric field. The 1-2-3 coordinate system is transformed to a global xyz system via a counterclockwise rotation by an angle  about the z axis using the mechanical component of the transformation

(3.59)

Likewise, for the electro-mechanical component in Eq. 3.58, the transformation matrix is:  cos -sin 0   [T ]e =  sin cos 0  0 0 1 

(3.60)

Therefore, the stress-strain relation for the mechanical portion with respect to the global coordinate system is:   m       x  x             y    y           z z 1 -1 = [T ]- k [Ct ]k [R][T ]k [R]    yz  yz              xz   xz              xy xy k

Similarly, the stress and electric field relation of Eq. 3.58 is transformed through the following expression:  e      x                y           Ex    Ex   z T -1 T e = [T ]k [ ]k [T ]k  [e]k (3.62) Ey Ey        yz         Ez k Ez k        xz          xy k where the piezoelectric coefficient matrix [e]T k is the transpose of [e]k and is expressed as:  0 0 0 0 e15 0   [e]T 0 0 e15 0 0  k =  0 e31 e31 e33 0 0 0 k The final constitutive relation is derived following the work by Sun and Huang [21]. The stress and strain about the x direction are assumed to be zero (i.e. z = z = 0) since the thickness of the PFRC layer is negligible. Applying these changes, the updated constitutive equation is expressed as:    ¯ 11 Q ¯ 12 0 ¯ 16   Q 0 Q x         ¯   ¯ 22 0 ¯ 26   Q12 Q 0 Q  y    ¯ 44 Q ¯ 45 0 = yz 0 Q  0       ¯ 45 Q ¯ 55 0 xz  0 Q    0       ¯ 16 Q ¯ 26 0 ¯ 66 xy k Q 0 Q     x         y    yz   xz       xy k

Applying the classical laminate theory (CLT) [23, 24], the resultant laminate stiffness matrix ABD can be determined. The force and moment resultants in the x coordinate are first determined with respect to the reference plane, at the middle of the laminate. The geometry of a laminate with n layers is shown in Figure 3.2.

Figure 3.2: Geometry of an n-layered laminate. [23]

The resultant forces and moments acting on the laminate are determined by integrating the stresses and moments of the stresses at each ply through the thickness of the laminate 30

[23, 24]. The normal force resultant Nx and shear force resultant Nxz as well as the bending moment resultant Mx and the twisting moment resultant Mxz are shown below: Nx Nxz

Strain Energy

The total variational strain energy for the PFRC laminate is described as: Ut = UtM + WtE (3.79)

The construction of the actuator is found by applying an electric field to the PFRC laminate, where the electric field is found via a simple proportional-derivative (PD) controller.

Chapter 4 Finite Element Modeling
As mentioned in Chapter 1, the bottom FGM beam and top PFRC laminate are modeled using either Euler-Bernoulli beam theory or Timoshenko beam theory. The kinematics of these theories involve a linear axial displacement and a constant transverse displacement. The kinematics of the viscoelastic layer is expressed using quadratic and cubic interpolations in the transverse and axial displacements, respectively. This section presents the finite element formulation of the ACLD beam with the bottom FGM beam and top PFRC laminate represented as Timoshenko beams. The schematic of a representative finite element of the ACLD beam is shown in Figure 4.1. The through-the-thickness variations of the displacements are defined using five locations along the entire thickness of the system: one for the bottom FGM beam, three for the viscoelastic core, and one for the top PFRC layer. These five locations are used to capture the field variables for each layer. Three nodes are defined along the span of the beam to allow for a quadratic interpolation of the transverse displacement field variable due to Timoshenko's beam theory. Nodes 1 and 3 have the same five locations through-the-thickness displacements, while node 2 has only the transverse displacement of each layer. The bottom FGM beam and top PFRC laminate are represented as Timoshenko beams. The axial displacements is interpolated with a linear function and the transverse displacements with a quadratic function. For the viscoelastic core, the axial displacement is represented by a cubic function, and the transverse displacement is interpolated with a quadratic function. The mixed interpolations prevent the occurrence of shear-locking. The global displacement vector of an element can be written as: uT e = {ub wb b uc2 uc3 wc ut wt t } (4.1)

where ui and wi are the axial and transverse displacement magnitudes, respectively, evaluated 35

at i = b, c, and t for bottom, core, and top layers, respectively. Also uc2 and uc3 are the two intermediate nodes in the core thickness. From the finite element schematic, it is established that both the first and third nodes each contains 9 degrees of freedom (DOF), and the middle node has 3 DOF, resulting in a total elemental DOF of 21. The element displacement vector qe can be expressed as:
T qe = {ub1 wb1 b1 uc2,1 uc3,1 wc1 ut1 wt1 t1 ...

...wb2 wc2 wt2 ... ... ub3 wb3 b3 uc2,3 uc3,3 wc3 ut3 wt3 t3 } (4.2)

where the subscripts bj , cj , and tj represents the bottom, core, and top layer, respectively with j = 1...3 signifying the node numbers. w and Note that if the top and bottom layers were Euler-Bernoulli beams, then  = x there would only be two element nodes along the span of the beam because the axial displacement is interpolated by linear functions and the Hermite cubic polynomial is used for the transverse displacement.

The axial displacement u and slope  field variables are interpolated along the span of the structure by a linear function, and transverse displacement field variable w by a quadratic function. These are: Linear Shape Functions +1 1- and N2 = for - 1    1 N1 = 2 2

(4.5)

The boolean variable  is 1 for Timoshenko beam theory and 0 for Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Also, there is no shear in Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (i.e. xz = 0), hence b (x, t) = wb (x, t). x The displacement vector from Eq. 3.2 uT b = {ub wb b } can be expanded as: ub = [Nb ]qe where   N1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   [Nb ] =  0 N3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N4 0 0 0 N5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 N1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N2 0 0 0 0 0 0 Subsequently, by substituting Eq. 4.9 into Eq. 3.21, the variation of the kinetic energy of the FGM beam is written as:

The Jacobian was determined to be |J ( )| = 2 case. The same procedure is followed in the formulation of the stiffness matrix by substituting ub from Eq. 4.6 into Eq. 3.24, expressing the variational strain energy as:

In shape function matrix notation, the displacement vector from Eq. 3.26, uT c = {ub wb b uc2 uc3 wc ut wt t } can be expressed as: uc = [Nc ]qe where   N1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0    0 N3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N4 0 0 0 N5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 N1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N2 0 0 0 0 0 0       0 0 0 N1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N2 0 0 0 0 0     [Nc ] =  0 0 0 0 N 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N 0 0 0 0 1  2       0 0 0 0 0 N3 0 0 0 0 N4 0 0 0 0 0 0 N5 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 N1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N2 0 0       0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N3 0 0 0 N4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N5 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 N2 (4.9)

Equation of Motion

The extended Hamilton's principle from Eq.3.18 is utilized to form the element governing equation of motion at a given time t as: ^ e (t) ([Mb ]e + [Mc ]e + [Mp ]e ) q ¨e (t) + [Kb ]e + [Kc ]e + [Kc ]e + [Kp ]e qe (t) = Fe (t) + Fce (t) + F t (4.21) e Note that the modified loading in the viscoelastic core Fc is negative on the right-handside of the above governing equation. The global system governing equations of motion are obtained by employing standard finite element method assembling techniques [39]. The global system governing equations of motion can be simplified as: ^ (t) [M]¨ q (t) + [K + K]q (t) = F(t) + F(t) + F (4.22)

Time Integration

The Newmark time-integration method [18, 31, 39] is employed to solve the global system governing equations of motion, Eq. 4.22. In order to incorporate the viscoelastic property of the core through fractional derivative, the classical Newmark algorithm is modified to have a new parameter for the storage of the anelastic displacement history. To ensure that the system is unconditionally stable, the Newmark parameters,  = 1/4 and  = 1/2, were employed. Appendix A contains the Matlab code that was used to simulate the three-layered model.

Chapter 5 Numerical Simulation
5.1 Formulation Comparison with Literature

In order to verify the current formulation, three simulations are performed and their results are compared to those in the literature. First, the work by Amarani et al. [13] on the free vibration analysis of a sandwich beam with a functionally graded (FG) core is revisited using the present formulation. The next simulation validates the viscoelastic property modeling of the ACLD beam. It requires modifying the current formulation and comparing it to the study by Galucio et al. [18] where the dynamic analysis of a sandwich beam with a viscoelastic core was investigated. Lastly, the dynamic analysis of a cantilever beam with a piezoelectric top layer from Bekuit et al. [6] is considered. Note that Quasi-2D EulerBernoulli (Q2DE) denotes the ACLD beam formulation where both the top and bottom layers are modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beams and the core is modeled via a higher-order beam theory. Similarly, quasi-2D Timoshenko (Q2DT) denotes the ACLD beam formulation where the core is modeled by a higher-order theory and the top and bottom layers as Timoshenko beams, as described in chapter 3.

5.1.1

Sandwich Beam with FG core

The current formulation is modified to study the free vibration analysis of a sandwich beam with FG core such as that by Amirani et al. [13]. The sandwich beam schematic is shown in Figure 5.1, wherein the beam consists of a FG core, composed of aluminum (metal) and zirconia (ceramic), and face sheets that are made of steel alloy. Two boundary conditions are analyzed, namely, fully- and partially- clamped cantilever. The fully-clamped boundary condition is the case when all three layers are fixed at one end. The partially-clamped case is when only the face sheets are fixed. Their properties are tabulated in Table 5.1. The 43

geometrical properties of the beam are length L = 1000 mm, face sheet thickness hf = 3 mm, and core thickness hc = 14 mm.

Following Amirani et al. [13] rule of mixtures technique, also known as power-law functionally graded material (P-FGM) in Ref. [17], the first 10 natural frequencies are found using the present quasi-2D formulation. The natural frequencies of the sandwich beam with a P-FGM core for fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered boundary conditions are reproduced in Table 5.2. A total of 100 elements along the length of the beam are used to produce the results for the quasi-2D formulations.

Amirani et al. [13] used the element free Galerkin (EFG) method in their formulation and reported frequencies that are slightly higher than those of the classical method from modes 5 to 10. A slight difference is observed between the fully- and partially- clamped cases for both Q2DE and Q2DT, wherein the partially-clamped case continuously has smaller frequencies as expected. Generally, the Q2DT reports smaller frequencies than the Q2DE. Again this is intuitive, since the Timoshenko beam theory is more flexible than the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. A comparison between Ref. [13] and the quasi-2D frequencies shows that the latter are smaller for the last few modes. Further, to compare the effects of the different distribution functions, the core is altered to be exponentially functionally graded material (E-FGM) following the formulation of Ref. [17]. The material properties remained the same for zirconia and aluminum, as previously shown in Table 5.1. In order to properly compare the two distributions, the P-FGM and E-FGM method should yeild equivalent average material properties, where h G(z )dz . The average values were Eavg  105 GP a, avg  0.3, avg  4015 Gavg = 21 h -h kg/m3 . For P-FGM to obtain these values, the constant p in the formulation was set to 0.78. The first 10 natural frequencies of the sandwich beam with a P-FGM (p = 0.78) and E-FGM core for fully-clamped and partially-clamped cantilevered boundary conditions are tabulated in Table 5.3. The natural frequencies for both P-FGM and E-FGM distributions have insignificant differences for both the fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered cases.

For the fully-clamped cantilevered condition in Table 5.3, there is very little difference between the natural frequencies of the homogeneous, P-FGM and E-FGM core distributions. The natural frequencies for the partially-clamped cantilevered case as tabulated in Table 5.4 and they are generally identical to those of the homogeneous, P-FGM and E-FGM core. For the last mode, however, there are greater differences in the homogeneous and FGM 46

frequencies compared to the fully-clamped case. The difference in values show that the quasi-2D formulation is better able to capture the effect of the unconstrained core.

5.1.2

Visco-Aluminum Sandwich Beam

The example by Galucio et al. [18] is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present quasi-2D formulation for a sandwich beam with a viscoelastic core. The viscoelastic core is sandwiched between two aluminum layers. The beam is clamped at one end and a triangular impulse transverse load is applied at the free end, as depicted in Figure 5.2. The geometric parameters of the beam are: length L = 200 mm, width b = 10 mm, thickness of top and bottom face sheets hf = 1 mm and thickness of core hc = 0.2 mm. The parameters of the fractional derivative model are:  = 0.7915 and  = 1.4052 × 10-2 ms. The mechanical properties of the elastic aluminum faces and the viscoelastic core are tablulated in Table 5.5. The time step and number of terms in the Gr¨ unwald series (taken from the example) are t = 0.25 ms and N = 1000, respectively.

The transverse displacement of the beam's tip under fully-clamped cantilevered boundary condition is shown in Figure 5.3. The present quasi-2D formulation (Q2DE and Q2DT) with

47

constant transverse displacement w in the host (bottom) beam yields the highest peak-topeak amplitude. A trend is observed where the formulation with higher degrees of freedom (DOF) yields smaller phase shifts than that for smaller DOF. The present quasi-2D formulation and the quasi-2D with varying w have smaller phase shifts than the classical response. For example, the classical method has 8 DOF, while the present quasi-2D formulation with constant w has 20 DOF and 21 DOF for Q2DE and Q2DT, respectively. In Ref. [3], the quasi-2D with varying w had 52 DOF. Note that the classical formulation is based on the classical three-layer theory from Section 1.1.1.

5.1.2.1

Visco-FGM Sandwich Beam

Here, the viscoelastic core sandwich beam is changed from an aluminum homogeneous material to a zirconia-aluminum functionally graded (FG) material. The geometry and boundary condition of the system remain the same as the visco-aluminum sandwich beam case in Section 5.1.2. Also, the same properties for zirconia and aluminum used in Section 5.1.1 are also used in this section, as shown in Table 5.1. The top and bottom surfaces of each FG layer consist of either 100% alumuminum and/or 100% zirconia with the following approximate average properties: Eavg  105 GP a, avg  0.3, avg  4015 kg/m3 . The first configuration consists of 100% zirconia (ceramic) material at the outer surfaces and 100% aluminum (metal) material at the inner surfaces of the top and bottom layers ((zirconia/aluminum)S ). Conversely, the second configuration consists of 100% aluminum (metal) material at the outer surfaces and 100% zirconia (ceramic) material at the inner surfaces of the top and bottom layers ((aluminum/zirconia)S ). The schematics of these configurations are shown in Figures 5.4 and 5.5.

Figure 5.4: Visco-E-FGM sandwich beam with (zirconia/aluminum)S orientation.

Figure 5.5: Visco-P-FGM (p = 0.78) sandwich beam with (aluminum/zirconia)S orientation.

49

The response of both the E-FGM and P-FGM representations for the (zirconia/aluminum)S and (aluminum/zirconia)S orientations are shown in Figures 5.6 and 5.7, and Figures 5.8 and 5.9, respectively. With respect to the (zirconia/aluminum)S configuration, the P-FGM representation results in smaller transverse displacements than the E-FGM representation. This is however different for the (aluminum/zirconia)S orientation where the P-FGM representation produces higher transverse displacements than the E-FGM representation. Figure 5.10 depicts a plot of all the Q2DT responses from the previous plots as well as the homogeneous representation of the top and bottom layers. The responses with the highest transverse displacement are those for the E-FGM representation for the (aluminum/zirconia)S orientation and those for the P-FGM representation for the (zirconia/aluminum)S orientation. Both responses result in similar transverse displacement with a slight phase shift. The smallest displacement occurs for the P-FGM with (aluminum/zirconia)S configuration and E-FGM with (zirconia/aluminum)s orientation. Based on these results, the use of the P-FGM distribution in a FG layer demands that the material with the highest modulus of elasticity contact the core layer in order to obtain the least amount of vibration. Conversely, using the E-FGM distribution requires that the material with the lowest elastic modulus contact the core to have the smallest amount of vibration.

Cantilevered Beam with Viscoelastic Core and Piezoelectric Constraining Layer

To further verify the accuracy of the present quasi-2D formulation, the work by Bekuit et al. [6] is reproduced and compared. The model consists of an isotropic host beam, a viscoelastic core, and a piezoelectric constraining layer. Figure 5.11 depicts the beam schematic and the triangular impulse load that is applied at the free end.

Figure 5.11: Cantilevered beam with viscoelastic core and piezoelectric constraining layer.

The geometric characteristics of the beam are: length L = 300 mm, width b = 15

53

mm, thickness of host layer hb = 3 mm, thickness of piezoelectric layer ht = 1 mm, and thickness of core hc = 0.2 mm and hc = 1.0 mm. The number of terms in the Gr¨ unwald approximation of the fractional derivative are N = 1000 and the time step is taken as t = 0.001 s. The mechanical and electrical properties of the active constraining layer (PZT5H), and the mechanical properties of the host beam (steel) and the viscoelastic core (ISD112) are tabulated in Table 5.6.

The passive damping tip displacement and the active-passive damping tip displacement and voltage are obtained for the present Q2DE and Q2DT formulations. Figure 5.12 plots the response of the Q2DE, Q2DT, Ref. [6], and classical method for a core thickness of hc = 0.2 mm. The first subplot, (a), depicts the tip deflection of the passively damped beam. The dynamic responses for Q2DE and Ref. [6] are identical while the Q2DT results in a slight phase shift from the two responses. All of the responses have the same amplitudes, but the conventional has an obvious phase shift from the three quasi-2D formulations. The introduction of active damping with a gain Kv = 100 V/(m/s) is depicted in the last two subplots, (b) and (c). As a result of this active actuation, the attenuation time of the beam has been reduced. The response amplitude of the classical method did not reduce by as much as the quasi-2D formulations. Further, Figure 5.13 depicts the response with each method with a thicker core, hc = 1 mm. The response amplitude of the classical formulation is continuously higher than those with the quasi-2D formulations. A possible explanation for this is that the quasi-2D formulations dissipate more energy since they better model the shear deformation of the core.

Parametric Study

A parametric study of the current quasi-2D formulation is performed to determine the effect of laminate stacking sequence (in the PFRC laminate) and the FG material properties of the host beam. The varying parameters include the ply angle  of the PFRC and the Young's modulus in the FG host beam. Variations in the Poisson's ratio and densities for both the metal and ceramic materials for the FG beam do not show any significant change to the response of the system. A schematic of the 3-layer system which comprises a FG host beam, viscoelastic core, and PFRC laminate constraining layer, as well as the triangular impulse load is depicted in Figure 5.14. Throughout the parametric study, the beam is consistently meshed into 6 finite elements along the span.

Figure 5.14: Beam with viscoelastic core and PFRC laminate constraining layer.

The geometric characteristics of the composite beam are: length L = 250 mm, width b = 15 mm, thickness of host layer hb = 3 mm, thickness of PFRC layer ht = 0.75 mm (0.1875 mm ply x 4 plies), thickness of viscoelastic core hc = 0.25 mm. The mechanical and piezoelectric properties of the constraining layer, core, and host beam are given in Table 5.7. The effective coefficients of the PFRC used in this study were predicted utilizing the micromechanical analysis performed by Mallik and Ray [12] with a 40% volume fraction.

Four types of boundary conditions are examined in each subsection: fully-clamped cantilever, partially-clamped cantilever, partially clamped-clamped, and simply-supported. The study is partitioned into two sections; the first is to study the effect of ply orientation in the PFRC laminate and the second is to examine the effect of the change in the elastic modulus of the metal and ceramic values for the FG host beam. A basic velocity feedback is implemented to control the vibration, as described in Chapter 2. Throughout this study, two methods of the quasi-2D are examined; Q2DE and Q2DT. As mentioned previously, quasi-2D Euler-Bernoulli (Q2DE) denotes the formulation where both the top and bottom layers are modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beams and the core is modeled using a higher-order theory. The quasi-2D Timoshenko (Q2DT), on the other hand, is the formulation where the top and bottom layers are modeled as Timoshenko beams.

5.2.1

Effect of Ply Orientation

To examine the effect of ply orientation on the dynamic response of the beam, the host beam remains homogeneous and isotropic with a constant elastic modulus and the number of plies in the constraining layer are fixed. A four-ply PFRC laminate with a stacking sequence of [1 /2 ]S is employed. The angles 1 and 2 are the fiber angles relative to the +x axis of each layer. 5.2.1.1 Fully-clamped Cantilevered Beam Case

The fully-clamped cantilevered beam is fully supported at the left end and free at the right as shown in Figure 5.15.

Figure 5.15: Fully-clamped cantilevered beam with ACLD treatment.

The gain that is chosen to best represent the effects of the beam vibration is Kv = 350

58

V/(m/s). This gain is suitable since the resulting actuation voltage is not in the breakdown voltage range, typically about 200 volts for most piezoelectric ceramics. An observation time of 0.5 seconds is selected for the beam response under impulse loading. The triangular impulse load is applied at the tip of the beam and is depicted in Figure 5.14. The time step is t = 0.001 s with the number of terms in the Gr¨ unwald approximation resulting in N = 1000.     The response of four different ply stacking sequences (0 4 , [0 /90 ]S , [45 / - 45 ]S , and [30 /60 ]S ) are determined for uncontrolled tip deflection and controlled tip deflection and actuation voltage. Figure 5.16 shows plots for uncontrolled transverse displacement of the tip node for passive damping. Figures 5.17 and 5.18 depict the response of the controlled tip deflection as well as its corresponding actuation voltage for each respective ply arrangement. With respect to passive damping, Figure 5.16, the [45 / - 45 ]S and [30 /60 ]S PFRC stacking arrangements experience the largest peak-to-peak amplitude of vibration. Since the 0 4 arrangement is the stiffest, it experiences the smallest peak-to-peak amplitude of vibration. This is expected since the stiffer constraining layer causes more shear in the core. With the application of active damping, the beam shows significant reduction in peakto-peak amplitude. Comparing the uncontrolled and controlled responses, Figures 5.16 and 5.17, the best controlled PFRC arrangement is the [0 /90 ]S PFRC. The control advantage is due to the contribution of 90 plies that increase the flexibility of the beam, enabling the constraining layer to be more suitable for active control. This ply angle induced flexibility can also be seen for the [45 / - 45 ]S and [30 /60 ]S PFRC arrangements as their responses are significantly damp when actively controlled. Although the 0 4 arrangement has the smallest peak-to-peak amplitude of passive vibration, it did not damp as much as the other three arrangements due to its stiff nature. The actuator voltage responses in Figure 5.18 resembles the controlled deflection responses in Figure 5.17 because of their linear relationship to the response velocity. Note that the magnitudes of the voltage are well below the breakdown voltage of 200 V.

5.2.1.2

Partially-clamped Cantilevered Beam Case

A partially-clamped cantilevered beam is partially-clamped at the left end and free at the right end as depicted in Figure 5.19. The clamped component is the host beam whereas the viscoelastic and PFRC layers are unconstrained.

Figure 5.19: Partially-clamped cantilevered beam with ACLD treatment.

Similar to the fully-clamped cantilevered beam case, the gain (Kv = 350 V/(m/s)) and geometric parameters remain the same. The simulation time is also unchanged at 0.5 seconds. With respect to ply arrangements and stiffness, the same observations are made and are depicted in Figures 5.20, 5.21, and 5.22. The major difference between the fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered cases arises in the peak-to-peak amplitudes of vibration. It is apparent that the partially-clamped case results in higher vibration amplitudes than the fully-clamped case due to the increased flexibility. A comparison between the fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered responses is further demonstrated and discussed in the next subsection.

5.2.1.3

Comparison of Fully- and Partially- Clamped Cantilevered with Classical Method

Figures 5.23, 5.24, and 5.25 depict a comparison of the fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered as well as the classical responses for uncontrolled and controlled damping. It is observed from the uncontrolled damping tip displacement responses in Figure 5.23 that the classical and Q2DT fully-clamped cantilevered cases have very similar responses, with a small phase shift from one another. The 0 4 ply arrangement has partially-clamped cantilevered responses that are higher in amplitude and has a lagging phase shift from the classical and fully-clamped cases. The differences are possibly due to the stiffness of the 0 4 PFRC. The [0 /90 ]S PFRC, perhaps due to its reduced stiffness, has a smaller amplitude difference ( the partially-clamped amplitude to the classical and fully-clamped cantilevered amplitudes)     than the the 0 4 PFRC. On the other hand, the [45 / - 45 ]S and [30 /60 ]S PFRC's resulted in very similar responses for all three (classical, partially- and fully- clamped cantilever) methods, due to its moderate flexibility. Now, with the introduction of a 350 V/(m/s) gain controller, the response is controlled and dampens according to its stiffness (see Figure 5.24). For all four ply arrangements, the Q2DT fully-clamped cantilevered response results in the least amount of vibration compared to the partially-clamped cantilevered and classical method. The [0 /90 ]S PFRC gives the best control. Also, the 0 4 PFRC is the only arrangement with its partially-clamped cantilevered amplitude of vibration greater than that of the classical method. Due to the high stiffness of the 0 4 PFRC, the partially-clamped cantilevered (unconstrained PFRC) does not have as much control as those that are more flexible. With respect to the voltage actuation, Figure 5.25, its response resembles that of the controlled deflection response, as indicated in Figure 5.24, due to their linear relationship.

5.2.1.4

Partially Clamped-clamped Beam Case

In order to take advantage of the actuation of the PRFC laminate, the host beam is the only component that is clamped at each end. The triangular impulse load, as seen in the second part of Figure 5.14, is applied in the transverse direction to the middle upper node of the top PFRC layer (shared between elements 3 and 4), as depicted in Figure 5.26.

Figure 5.26: Partially clamped-clamped beam with ACLD treatment.

The same gain as in both the cantilevered beam cases, Kv = 350 V/(m/s), is utilized in this instance. All parameter specifications remain the same except for the host beam thickness and the time period, which is reduced to hb = 2.0 mm from 3.0 mm and 0.25 seconds from 0.5 seconds, respectively. Note that the parameter modifications were made solely for the enhancement of the presentation. As a result of the boundary conditions, the response for the partially clamped-clamped should have higher frequency of vibration as well as smaller transverse displacement compared to the cantilevered beam cases. The deflection of interest is that of the middle node of the ACLD beam in the transverse direction. The passive and active-passive damping responses are depicted in Figures 5.27 and 5.28, respectively. Figure 5.29 is the actuator voltage plots that complement the displacement responses. As in the cantilevered beam cases, the same PFRC arrangements are analyzed. The partially clamped-clamped beam case exhibits the same response pattern as the cantilevered beam examples. The passive 0 4 PFRC response in Figure 5.27 results in the best damping, which follows the same reasoning as the fully-clamped cantilevered beam case. Further, the [0 /90 ]S PFRC is found to be the most controlled among the active-passive damping response. This is due to the enhancement of actuation control in a more flexible PFRC laminate, as depicted in Figure 5.28. The [45 / - 45 ]S PFRC plot shows the worst damping response, since the flexibility of the PFRC laminate is not increased in the bending direction. The actuation voltage responses, seen in Figure 5.29, are directly proportional to

71

the derivative of the controlled damping responses in Figure 5.28.

5.2.1.5

Simply-supported Beam Case

The configuration of the simply-supported boundary condition consists of the support of two corner nodes, each at the ends of the beam, as depicted in Figure 5.30. These support are constrained in both the axial and transverse displacements.

Figure 5.30: Simply-supported beam with ACLD treatment.

Similar to the partially clamped-clamped beam case, the gain, host beam thickness, and observation time period are Kv = 350 V/(m/s), hb = 2.0 mm, and t = 0.25 seconds, respectively. Also, the same triangular impulse load is applied to the middle node in the transverse direction. Figures 5.31, 5.32, and 5.33 illustrate the uncontrolled-passive damping, active-passive damping, and actuator voltage of the simply-supported beam, respectively. The deflection of the simply-supported beam is observed to be much higher than the partially clampedclamped beam (almost 1.5 times). This observation is plausible and it is attributed to the increased flexibility of the beam. The same four PFRC arrangements are examined as in the previous cases. Similar to the other cases, the passive 0 4 PFRC arrangement in Figure 5.31 shows the fastest damping while the [45 / - 45 ]S and [30 /60 ]S PFRC's have very slow attenuation rates due to their lower stiffnesses. Also, from Figure 5.32, the controlled-active-passive response that has the best damping response is, once again, the [0 /90 ]S PFRC.

Effect of FGM Properties

In order to study the effect of the functionally graded (FG) property in the host beam, all of the plies in the PFRC laminate are set to  = 0 . The material properties of the FGM beam are assumed to change continuously throughout the thickness of the beam, according to the volume fraction of the constituent materials based on the function. In this study, the Young's modulus, E , is analyzed under the power-law function and exponential function. The average stiffness of the host beam either increases or decreases by varying the Young's h E (z )dz , where modulus. The average modulus of elasticity is represented as Eavg = 21 h -h E (z ) is either the power-law function, Equation 3.9, or exponential function, Equation 3.10. The constituents are metal and ceramic material, wherein the Young's modulus of each are denoted by EM and EC , respectively. The top of the host beam has 100% metal composition and the bottom has 100% ceramic composition. Note that only the elastic modulus is analyzed since previous analysis in section 5.2 indicated that the effects of changes in the density and Poisson's ratio are neglible. Throughout this investigation, all material properties and parameters of the top PFRC, viscoelastic core, and host beam remain the same as that used in Table 5.7, with the exception of the host beam's Young's modulus. The beam problems remain the same, with the parameter specifications as depicted Figure 5.14. Also, the gain remains the same as the previous subsection, Kv = 350 V/(m/s). Three scenarios are investigated to study the effect of the FG property in the host beam: (i) the effect of change in average elastic moduli, (ii) the effect of varying constituents moduli for fixed average elastic moduli, and (iii) the effect of exchange in the metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli. The first analysis is performed by fixing the ceramic elastic modulus, EC , and altering the metal elastic modulus, EM , in order to have average elastic moduli, Eavg , of 200 GPa, 230 GPa, and 260 GPa. The variation of Young's modulus with respect to the change in the average elastic modulus is tabulated in Table 5.8.

Next, Eavg is fixed to 200 GPa while both the ceramic and metal elastic moduli change accordingly. In order to obtain an elastic modulus average of 200 GPa, the ceramic and metal elastic moduli were discretely chosen to fit the Eavg relation. The change in elastic modulus E , from metal to ceramic, continually increases as seen in Table 5.9. The metal and ceramic Young's moduli from the table experiences variations similar to those in Figure 5.34. The P-FGM and E-FGM distributions intersect at the middle of the beam thickness because the Eavg 's are the same.

Finally, the previous data with fixed average elastic moduli are used to exchange the metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli. This exchange demonstrates the effect of selecting the constituents of the FG beam and their placements, either on the top or bottom of the host beam. Table 5.10 shows the values used when exchanging the metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli. The elastic moduli for EM < EC exhibits variations that are similar to those in Figure 5.35. 80

Figure 5.36 includes the combination of Figures 5.34 and 5.35. By alternating the elastic moduli of the metal and ceramic constituents for the P-FGM and E-FGM functions, they exhibit nearly exact slopes. Since the formulas for both FGM distributions are different, they will not match exactly, but are very close. The reason for this is because the average values were forced to be the same.

5.2.2.1

Fully- and Partially- Clamped Cantilevered Beam Cases

The fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered beam problems remain the same as the parameter specifications mentioned in section 5.2.1 and in Figures 5.15 and 5.19. For each scenario, the dynamic response for both fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered boundary conditions are depicted in: (i) Figures 5.37, 5.38 and 5.39; (ii) Figures 5.40, 5.41 and 5.42; and (iii) Figure 5.43. (i) Effect of change in average elastic moduli: Figures 5.37 and 5.38 correspond to the transverse displacement response in the uncontrolledpassive and controlled-active-passive damping states, respectively. Figure 5.39 is the actuation voltage response with a gain of Kv = 350 V/(m/s) applied to the composite beam. Within these figures, parts (a), (b), and (c) are the responses for Eavg of 200 GPa, 230 GPa, and 260 GPa, respectively. Comparing the fully- and partially- clamped cantilevered responses, it is evident that the partially-clamped response has greater transverse displacement than the fully-clamped response due to its flexibility, since only the host beam is constrained. Consistently, the Q2DT E-FGM has the lowest peak-to-peak amplitude, followed by the homogeneous, and then by the Q2DT P-FGM response. With increasing Eavg , the Q2DT E-FGM decreases in transverse displacement, resulting in better damping capabilities than the Q2DT P-FGM and homogeneous responses. Furthermore, the frequency of the response increases with increasing Eavg . For both passive and active-passive damping, Figures 5.37 and 5.38, as Eavg increases, the Q2DT P-FGM gradually increases in peak-to-peak amplitude and becomes more out of phase with the Q2DT E-FGM and homogeneous responses. For the fully-clamped cantilevered case, as Eavg increases, the Q2DT E-FGM gradually becomes more in-phase with the homogeneous response. For the fully-clamped case, however, as Eavg increases, the partially-clamped Q2DT E-FGM gradually becomes more out of phase with the homogeneous response. The actuator voltage responses in Figure 5.39 are proportional to the rate of deflection responses in Figure 5.38.

(ii) Effect of varying constituents moduli for fixed average elastic moduli: Figures 5.40 and 5.41 represent the uncontrolled-passive and controlled-active-passive tip displacement responses with Eavg of 200 GPa, respectively. Both tip displacements follow the same trend and observations. Figure 5.42 is the actuation voltage response of the controlled-active-passive damping, which is proportional to the displacement response. For each part (a), (b), and (c), the E 's are 109 GPa, 252 GPa, and 366 GPa, respectively (as shown in Table 5.9). The increase in E could be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the chosen FG function. For example, as E increases, the Q2DT P-FGM response increases in peak-to-peak amplitude of vibration, while the Q2DT E-FGM response decreases in amplitude of vibration.

(iii) Effect of exchange in the metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli: Figure 5.43 is the uncontrolled-passive damping response for the exchange of metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli. Part (a) for both the fully- and partiallyclamped cantilevered responses show that at a low E of 109 GPa, the responses match almost exactly for both Q2DT E-FGM and P-FGM. However, in part (b), only the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) match when E is increased to 252 GPa. The Q2DT P-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT E-FGM (EM < EC ) result in the same amplitude of vibration, but an apparent phase shift from each other. Furthermore, the phase shift shown in part (b) becomes larger in part (c). Also, in part (c) the responses that used to match do not match anymore, especially for the partially-clamped case, where there is a slight phase shift. As E increases, the Q2DT P-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT E-FGM (EM < EC ) responses continue to increase in amplitude in comparison to the homogeneous response. On the other hand, as E increases, the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses decrease in amplitude in comparison to the homogeneous response. In order to obtain the least amount of vibration, either the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) or Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses should be used. For example, should the exponential function be used to represent a FG beam, the top elastic modulus must be greater than the bottom. For a power-law function FG beam, the top elastic modulus should be less than the bottom.

5.2.2.2

Partially Clamped-clamped Beam Case

A clamped-clamped ACLD beam that is constrained only at the host beam is shown in Figure 5.26 in Section 5.2.1. The same parameters are used in this section. Also, the same response sequence is repeated as in the previous case, for the three scenarios, which includes the response due to passive damping, active-passive damping, and control voltage. (i) Effect of change in average elastic moduli: Figures 5.44, 5.45 and 5.46 depict the passive damped, active-passive damped, and control voltage responses, respectively. As the average elastic modulus Eavg increases, the same pattern is observed as the cantilevered cases, wherein, the Q2DT P-FGM response increases, while the Q2DT E-FGM response decreases in its peak-to-peak amplitudes of vibration relative to the homogeneous response. The frequency of vibration also increases as the Eavg increases. A careful observation of the Q2DT E-FGM responses shows improved damping with higher Eavg . These patterns are the same for all three responses (passive, active-passive, and control voltage).

(ii) Effect of varying constituents moduli for fixed average elastic modulus: The passive and active-passive tip displacement responses are depicted in Figures 5.47 and 5.48 with Eavg , respectively.

Figure 5.49 is the actuation voltage response of the active-passive damping, which is proportional to the displacement response. For part (a) of all the responses, the Q2DT E-FGM and homogeneous response almost match exactly, while the Q2DT P-FGM response has a slight phase shift from the two. As the E increases in part (b), the responses are out of phase from each other. Also, the Q2DT E-FGM response decreased in transverse displacement, while the Q2DT P-FGM response increased in transverse displacement compared to part (a). Furthermore, in part (c), the same observation from part (b) is seen, but with more decrease and increase in transverse displacement, for the E-FGM and P-FGM responses, respectively. From Figure 5.48, the response that has the best damping capabilities is the Q2DT E-FGM in part (c), this has the biggest E .

With respect to part (b), two responses with the smallest transverse displacement (Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC )) match each other. The two responses with the largest transverse displacement (Q2DT P-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT E-FGM (EM < EC )) result in the same peak-to-peak amplitude, but have different phase shift. A larger phase shift for both the smaller and larger displacement responses are seen from part (b) to part (c). As E increases, the Q2DT P-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT E-FGM (EM < EC ) responses continue to increase in amplitude, while the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses decrease in amplitude in comparison to the homogeneous response. The responses that have the best damping capabilities are the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses.

5.2.2.3

Simply-supported Beam Case

The same simply-supported beam depicted in Figure 5.30 and its parameters from Section 5.2.1 are utilized in this section. (i) Effect of change in the average elastic modulus: Figures 5.51 and 5.52 depict the responses of the beam when it is passively and actively damped, respectively. Figure 5.53 shows the actuator voltage response when the system gain is Kv = 350 V/(m/s) as indicated in the previous sections. The plot for part (a) has responses that are almost exact with extremely small phase shifts. Just like the other beam cases, as Eavg increases, the Q2DT E-FGM response becomes more damped, decreasing in transverse displacement, whereas, the Q2DT P-FGM response increases in transverse displacement. However, the progression in transverse displacement is not as prominent as in the other beam cases. Also, as Eavg increases, the responses slowly become more out of phase with each other. An observation between the Eavg 's from parts (a) to (c) shows that the final amplitudes are generally the same. The responses with a higher Eavg start with a smaller amplitude than that of a lower Eavg , but both dampen to the same amplitude. The actuation voltage is proportional to the active-passive deflection. Also, as observed for previous cases, the frequency of vibration increases as Eavg increases. In comparison to the partially clamped-clamped beam case, the simply-supported beam experiences higher amplitudes of vibration, but reduced frequency.

(ii) Effect of varying constituents moduli for fixed average elastic modulus: Figures 5.54 and 5.55 depict the passive and active-passive tip displacement responses when Eavg = 200 GPa.

As E increases, the Q2DT E-FGM response progressively dampens, where the best damping is observed at part (c) Figure 5.55 , E = 366 GPa. Due to the nature of the power-law function, as E increases, the Q2DT P-FGM response gradually increases in amplitude. Unlike the other beam cases, the simply-supported case has passive and activepassive tip displacement responses that do not follow the same pattern. For parts (b) and (c), the passive-damped beams generally have responses that are in phase to one another, but for the active-passive damped scenarios, the Q2DT P-FGM responses do not damp as well as the Q2DT E-FGM responses. Also, the active-passive damping responses become out-of-phase from one another. The actuation voltage produces the same pattern as the active-passive response because they are directly proportional to each other.

(iii) Effect of exchange in the metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli: Figure 5.57 depicts the response for the passive damping of the exchange of metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli. Similar observations are made from the partially clamped-clamped problem. A comparison between the two (partially clamped-clamped and simply-supported) shows that the simply-supported response has lower frequency and larger peak-to-peak amplitude of vibration than the partially clamped-clamped case. In part (a) of Figure 5.57, the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses as well as the Q2DT P-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT E-FGM (EM < EC ) responses match perfectly. The Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses are exactly in phase with the homogeneous response, but have slightly smaller transverse displacement. With increasing E , the responses that matched in part (a) no longer match in parts (b) and (c); they experience larger phase shifts. Also, for parts (b) and (c), there are no responses that are in phase with the homogeneous response. The Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and Q2DT P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses at the highest E in part (c) result in the best damping capabilities.

Chapter 6 Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations
A quasi-2D finite element formulation is presented in the previous chapters for the vibration analysis of a functionally graded (FG) host beam with an active-passive constraining layer damping (ACLD) treatment. The ACLD treatment is composed of a viscoelastic layer that passively damps the structure and a piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC) laminate that actively constrains the layer. The PFRC laminate acts as the actuator of the system through a velocity feedback control system. The PFRC laminate consists of four plies that are oriented at an angle  in the reference plane of the system. The ABD constitutive matrix, which relates force and moment resultants with strains and curvatures, is determined through the use of the classical lamination theory (CLT). The host beam is taken to have a Young's modulus that is varying along the thickness of the beam, while the Poisson's ratio and density are constant throughout the beam. The viscoelastic material time-dependent behavior is described by utilizing a four-parameter fractional derivative model. The formulation of the three-layer beam system is developed as a quasi-2D Euler Bernoulli (Q2DE) and quasi-2D Timoshenko (Q2DT). The Q2DE is a model whereby the top PFRC laminate and bottom host beam follow the Euler-Bernoulli beam hypotheses and the viscoelastic core follows a higher-order beam theory. Similarly, the Q2DT is a model where the top PFRC laminate and bottom host beam are formulated as Timoshenko beams and the viscoelastic core remains based on a higher-order beam theory. The deformation kinematics of the top constraining layer and bottom host beam are such that the axial displacements are linear in the thickness coordinate and transverse displacements are constant. In the viscoelastic core, the axial displacement varies cubically, while the transverse displacement varies quadratically. Although this model has a smaller amount of degrees of freedom (DOF) 113

than the previous work done by Ref. [3], it is highly accurate. The present quasi-2D formulation is significantly simplified while maintaining the same level of accuracy. Three examples from the literature are utilized to determine the efficiency of this current formulation: a sandwich beam with functionally graded (FG) core, a visco-aluminum sandwich beam and a cantilevered beam with viscoelastic core and piezoelectric constraining layer. Throughout the parametric study, the active-passive constraining layer continuously showed superior damping capabilities over the passive damping. Four boundary conditions were analyzed: fully-clamped cantilevered, partially-clamped cantilevered, partially clamped-clamped and simply-supported beams. Two studies were performed to examine the effect of ply orientation and the effect of FGM properties. During the effect of ply orientation analysis, it was observed that the passively damped fully-clamped cantilevered beam with a stacking sequence of 0 4 resulted in the best damping rate because its stiffness causes the greatest shear deformation of the viscoelastic core. In the active-passive scenario, however, this stiffness works against the active control effort of the actuator; hence, the [0 /90 ]S is better complemented and provides the best attenuation rate. For the partially-clamped cantilevered beam case, active-passive damping has a very slow attenuation rate compared to the fully-clamped cantilevered beam. In the partially clampedclamped case, the vibration pattern was similar to the clamped cantilevered cases, but with smaller amplitude and higher frequency. The simply-supported beam responses have larger amplitude and lower frequency compared to the partially clamped-clamped responses. In the study of the effect of FGM properties on the host beam, three scenarios were examined: (i) the effect of change in average elastic moduli, (ii) the effect of varying constituents moduli for fixed average elastic moduli, and (iii) the effect of exchange in the metal to ceramic and ceramic to metal elastic moduli. It was observed that all four boundary conditions yielded the same response patterns, but with different ranges in actuation. In the first scenario, with increasing Eavg , the Q2DT E-FGM response slightly decreased in transverse displacement and the Q2DT P-FGM displacement scarcely changed. Also, as Eavg increased, the frequency of each response increased. Out of the four beam cases, the simply-supported beam yielded the most uniform displacement for all formulation responses (Q2DT E-FGM, P-FGM, and homogeneous). With respect to part (ii) of the FGM analysis such that the average Young's moduli Eavg were fixed to 200 GPa, as E increased, the transverse displacement of the Q2DT EFGM response gradually decreased while the Q2DT P-FGM response increased. The Q2DT E-FGM response with the largest E yielded the best damping rate. For part (iii), as E increased, the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) and P-FGM (EM < EC ) responses gradually decreased as the Q2DT P-FGM (EM > EC ) and E-FGM (EM < EC ) 114

responses increased. At the largest E , the response that yielded the smallest peak-to-peak amplitude of vibration was the Q2DT E-FGM (EM > EC ) response followed very closely by the P-FGM (EM < EC ) response. These observations suggest that, for a host beam with 100% metal composition at the top and 100% ceramic composition at the bottom of the beam, using the E-FGM distribution demands that the material with the highest elastic modulus (EM when EM > EC ) be placed at the top of the host beam to obtain the least amount of vibration. Also, the use of the P-FGM distribution in a FG host beam requires that the material with the lowest elastic modulus (EM when EM < EC ) should be situated at the top of the beam in order to obtain the best damping. Even though the current study is quite thorough, there is always room for improvement, such as the utilization of other materials to enhance the structure. Further extension of this work could possibly aid in the solution to noise and vibration problems. Future investigations may include: 1. The present formulation can progress to include the concept of plates and/or shells. A quasi-3D finite element model such as that seen in Ref. [9] can be utilized. 2. The use of different viscoelastic models can be examined. This thesis uses the fourparameter fractional derivative model which could not be directly replicated using commercial finite element software such as ANSYS which employs the Prony series method to represent viscoelastic material. 3. The viscoelastic constraining layer could incorporate an FG property where its elastic modulus varies throughout the thickness. The effectiveness of the active constraining layer might be improved since it would be bonded to the surface of the passive viscoelastic layer where there will be less stiffness and, thus, increase the actuation of the beam. 4. The presence of imperfect bonding can be explored. 5. The current formulation can be verified experimentally by performing vibration simulation tests.
