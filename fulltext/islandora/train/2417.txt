ABSTRACT A COMPARISON OF ACUTE TOXICITY OF BIODIESEL, BIODIESEL BLENDS AND DIESEL ON AQUATIC ORGANISMS
By Nalissa Farrah Khan Environmental Applied Science and Management, 2005 Master o f Applied Science, Ryerson University

The increasing demand o f alternative energy sources has created interest in biodiesel and biodiesel blends; biodiesel is promoted as a diesel substitute. Like diesel spills, biodiesel spills can have deleterious effects on aquatic environments. The effect o f neat biodiesel, biodiesel blends and diesel on O. mykiss and D. magna was evaluated using acute toxicity testing. Static non-renewal bioassays o f freshwater organisms containing BlOO, B50, B20, B5 and conventional diesel fuel were used to compare the acute effects of biodiesel to diesel. Mortality was the significant endpoint measured in this study; percent mortality and lethal concentration (LC50) at different exposure times were determined from the acute toxicity tests performed. Trials were considered valid if the controls exhibited more than 90% survival. Based on percent mortality and LC50 values, a toxicity ranking of fuels was developed. The results of the definitive tests indicated that diesel is more toxic than neat biodiesel and biodiesel blends. This approach can provide insights into the lethality o f biodiesel spills in the aquatic environment.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Overview Biodiesel is viewed as a viable alternative fuel to petroleum-based diesel. Dwindling oil reserves, expanding capitalization, increasing fuel prices, socio-economic and environmental problems have heightened the interest in renewable, affordable energy sources. Biodiesel is referred to as an energy carrier; it is also classified as a type of modified or enhanced fuel. Biodiesel is characterized as methyl or ethyl esters derived from plant oil, animal fat or yellow grease; these esters must conform to certain standards and specifications for use in diesel engines (Van Gerpen et al., 2004). Biodiesel refers to the pure fuel before blending with diesel fuel occurs; it is also referred to as neat biodiesel.

Biodiesel is also categorized as a liquid biofuel; it is a clean burning alternative fuel, produced from renewable resources, such as biomass, for example, herbaceous and woody plants, agricultural crops, forestry by-products, municipal solid and industrial wastes. Raw materials for biodiesel are mostly vegetable oils and waste animal fats; recycled cooking oils and grease are also used in biodiesel production.

Biodiesel can be blended with diesel fuel or used straight in place of fossil diesel in conventional diesel engines. Neat biodiesel contains no diesel fuel however it can be blended with diesel to produce biodiesel blends. Biodiesel can be used as additive volumes to diesel fuel or as premium fuel on its own; biodiesel blends of B5 are additive volumes and blends higher than B5 are considered premium diesel. As green fuels, particularly bioethanol and biodiesel, are becoming more commercialized, their fate in the environment is an area of concern since fuel spills

constitute

a m ajor source o f aquatic ecosystem contamination (Zhang et al.,

1995).

Contam ination o f aquatic ecosystems by biodiesel m ay have serious consequences to organisms in these environments.

1.2 Sources o f Biodiesel Biodiesel is m ost com m only produced from edible oils; edible oils are oils fit for human consum ption, such as vegetable oils. Biodiesel can be produced from many different types o f plant oil; rapeseed oil is m ost common in Europe, soybean oil in North America and palm oil in Southeast A sia (Boyd et al, 2004). Biodiesel can be produced from a wide variety o f feedstocks; som e biodiesel feedstocks include soybeans, rapeseeds, maize, sunflower, coconut, canola oil, fish oils, w aste animal fats, tallow and lard. Another feasible and realistic alternative source o f biodiesel is w aste cooking oils and fats from the restaurant and food processing industries (Rideout, 2004). These waste materials are becoming increasingly difficult to dispose o f and create carbon dioxide emissions if they are dumped in landfills. Yellow grease can be chemically cleaned and processed; acceptable quality biodiesel can then be produced. Using waste oils and fats as a feedstock for biodiesel production may reduce further environmental pollution.

1.3 Thesis Organization Section 2 is the literature review, which examines some pertinent issues involving biodiesel in the aquatic environment. This is followed by Section 3, the materials and method, which provides details on the methodology used for conducting all experiments. Section 4 presents the results obtained from the experiments performed on D. magna and O. mykiss. Section 5 consists

o f an analysis and discussion o f the results obtained in the study and Section 6 is the conclusions and recommendations for further research in the area o f biodiesel toxicity.

2.1 Introduction

2. LITERATURE REVIEW ;

The world relies heavily on fossil fuels, such as oil and natural gas, as its main source o f energy. Reserves o f non-renewable resources are considered depleted when supplies are too expensive to extract, process or m ine (Puppan, 2000). It is estimated that crude oil reserves m ay be 80% depleted w ithin the next 35 to 90 years, depending on its demand. At the current rate o f consumption, global crude oil reserves will last at least 45 more years. W ith increasing industrialization, global oil consumption is projected to increase by about 25% by 2010 (Puppén, 2000). Projections o f future economic and energy needs will increase the focus on more renew able sources o f energy, such as biomass and waste products (Tashtoush et al., 2004).

Biom ass is a likely alternative source o f energy, particularly liquid biofuels. Two important liquid biofuels are bioethanol and biodiesel. Biodiesel has considerable potential as a new and feasible source o f renewable energy, particularly as a transportation fuel in both m ore developed and less developed countries.

2.2 D efinition o f Biodiesel Biodiesel are alkyl esters o f vegetable oils, waste animal fats and other organic materials, however, biodiesel is not oils or fats. According to the ASTM standards: The term "biodiesel" means the mono-alkyl esters o f long chain fa tty acids derived fro m p la n t or anim al matter which m eet (A) the registration requirements fo r fu els and fu e l additives established by the Environmental Protection Agency under section 211 o f the Clean A ir A ct (42 U.S.C. 7545), and (B) the requirements o f the American Society o f Testing and M aterials D 6 7 5 l`
`Energy Policy Act of 2003, Conference Version, Section 1314

Biodiesel can be either neat ethyl or methyl esters prepared from vegetable oils, animal fats and yellow grease. Biodiesel is an ester that can be made from several different types of oils; however, it is primarily recovered from vegetable and animal fats. The process o f making biodiesel is called Trans-Esterification, organic oils and fats are combined with alcohol to form fatty esters, such as ethyl and methyl esters. These esters can be mixed with conventional diesel fuel; these fuel mixtures are referred to as biodiesel blends. Biodiesel can be used as a neat fuel, which is commercially referred to as 100% biodiesel (BlOO).

Numerous studies (Boyd et., 2004), (Sheehan et ah, 1998) have suggested that biodiesel is a clean burning substitute for diesel fuel; biodiesel is processed from natural, renewable materials and in terms of engine performance, biodiesel has similar properties as conventional diesel. Biodiesel operates well in compression-ignition engines and low level blends, i.e. blends of up to 2 0 % biodiesel, can be used in almost all diesel equipment, engines and vehicles. Due to the applicability o f biodiesel as a substitute for diesel fiiel, there has been recent interest in the production o f biodiesel as an alternative energy source for commercial and industrial processes.

2.3 Biodiesel Production Biodiesel is commonly produced from new and even used vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel is recovered from vegetable fats from such crops as soybean, rapeseed, canola, maize, sunflower, palm and coconut oil; they can also be recovered from animal fats, such as tallow and lard, as well as fish oils. In addition, waste cooking oils and fats have become a very popular feedstock in biodiesel production.

Biodiesel is m ade b y reacting any natural oils or fats with alcohol, in m ost cases, methanol is used to produce fatty acid alkyl esters. These raw materials are transformed into biodiesel using a variety o f Trans-Esterification technologies. There are three primary methods for producing biodiesel from fats and oils:
1) Base catalyzed Trans-Esterification o f the oil with alcohol (usually methanol). 2) D irect acid catalyzed Trans-Esterification o f the oil with methanol. 3) Conversion o f the oil to its fatty acids by acid catalysis and then to biodiesel.

Oils and fats are m ainly composed o f triglycerides, which are chemical compounds o f fatty acids, glycerin and free fatty acids (FFAs). The FFAs are bonded with methanol to produce biodiesel under acidic conditions. The triglycerides are also transformed into biodiesel and glycerin under base conditions, as indicated in Appendix A (Puppan, 2002). Base catalyzed reaction is the m ost common form o f producing biodiesel because this type o f reaction requires low tem peratures and pressures, it also yields a high conversion with very few side reactions, m inim al reaction tim e and there is direct conversion with no intermediate compounds (Van G erpen et ah, 2004).

A lthough there are different ways to produce alkyl esters, some important factors in the fuel production process include (i) a complete Trans-Esterification process, (ii) mixing intensity, (iii) reaction variables (reaction temperature, catalyst used, ratio o f alcohol to oil, purity o f reactants), (iv) glycerin, alcohol and any catalyst used must be removed from the end products and (v) no FFAs should be present in the alkyl esters produced (Bamwal and Sharma, 2005).

Biodiesel refers to the pure fuel; biodiesel blends (BXX) refers to a fuel that is composed o f X X % biodiesel and 1- XX% diesel fuel (Tyson, 2001), for example, BlOO is pure biodiesel and

B20 is a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel fuel. The diesel fuel can be no. 1, no. 2, or IPS (Dmytryshyn, et al., 2004). At present, Europe is the largest producer and consumer o f biodiesel and biodiesel blends, however, there are many potential markets in North America.

2.4 Present Uses o f Biodiesel Fuel markets that can benefit from biodiesel include bus and truck fleets, heavy construction equipment, diesel cars and boats, railways and electric generators. In 1991, biodiesel was commercially introduced in Germany, since then European biodiesel production has increased tremendously; biodiesel is the fastest developing alternative fuel source in Europe (Boyd et al., 2004). In 2000, Germany, France, Austria and Italy produced approximately one billion litres of biodiesel. Different legislations, tax incentives and oil production subsidies and grants have resulted in biodiesel being priced competitively with diesel fuel in these European countries. Also, in some European countries, marketing cooperatives have produced biodiesel on a smallscale for their own consumption and many European car manufacturers, including Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen have approved biodiesel use for their engines (Boyd et al., 2004).

2.5 Biodiesel in Canada In Canada, biodiesel is still in the early stages of commercial and research development; in 1994, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada investigated the feasibility of biodiesel and analyzed a number o f Canadian industries that may be potential biodiesel consumers (Prakash, 1998). The markets which were researched included (i) mining and petroleum exploration activities, (ii) government fleets and urban transit systems, (iii) national parks and ski resorts, (iv) forestry and (v) marine areas (Prakash, 1998). Before successful biodiesel consumption can succeed, some

concerns m ust be addressed. These concerns include: (i) high price o f biodiesel compared to conventional diesel, (ii) lack o f engine and vehicle manufacturers' approval o f biodiesel usage, (iii) the perform ance and quality o f biodiesel produced and (iv) the availability o f reliable biodiesel feedstock (Prakash, 1998). Some Canadian initiatives include the Alternative Fuels Act; this act introduces legislation asserting the use o f alternative fuel vehicles by all federal governm ent departments, agencies and Crown Corporations. Unfortunately, at present, there is no m ajor commercial use o f biodiesel in Canada; however, some urban bus fleets are using biodiesel blends on an experimental basis. The practicality and environmental benefits o f biodiesel have garnered attention from the Canadian government; the federal government has set a target production rate o f 500 million litres per annum by 2010, under Canada's Climate Change A ction Plan (Boyd et al., 2004).

2.6 Biodiesel Dem and Diesel is essential in the transportation sector o f many industrial and commercial regions; diesel is used quite extensively in transporting goods and services; this demand is increasing both in m ore developed and less developed countries. With fluctuating oil prices, demand uncertainty and growing environmental concerns, an alternative fuel which is technically feasible, econom ically competitive, environmentally acceptable (Dmytryshyn et al., 2004) and readily available is needed to alleviate concerns about current and future use o f non-renewable resources.

Biodiesel is not a new fuel technologically; Rudolf Diesel invented the diesel engine over 100 years ago, he suggested that the compression-ignition engine could have been operated with

peanut oil. However, as industrialization increased; petroleum became the prevailing energy source and diesel replaced vegetable oil as the fuel source for compression-ignition engines. However, interest in vegetable oils as a potential fuel source has waxed and waned over the years, with interest escalating during emergency conditions, such as World Wars 1 and II and the Persian Gulf War, as well as during the energy crisis of the 1970s, when petroleum supplies were interrupted (Raneses et al., 1999). In the past decade, environmental and energy security issues have led to renewed concern in alternative fuels, such as biofuels, particularly bioethanol and biodiesel.

Biodiesel can easily be substituted for petroleum diesel fuel in most diesel engines with no or only minor modifications and a slight decrease in power and fuel efficiency (Raneses et al., 1999). Biodiesel can be used as a diesel additive or a premium diesel to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions. The most common blend is 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel, popularly referred to as B20. B20 is referred to as premium blend and it also significantly reduces particulate matter emissions from diesel engines (Sheehan et al., 1998). Biodiesel demand along with expectations o f increasing commercial demand has prompted great interest in biodiesel production.

In North America, more specifically, the biodiesel industry in the United States has identified three specific markets, which include: (i) public transportation (especially bus fleets), (ii) mining and (iii) marine and environmentally sensitive areas. These niche markets are considered possible candidates for potential biodiesel commercialization.

Biodiesel production has increased rapidly over the past decade. In Europe, biodiesel blends are readily available at filling stations, however, the commercial transportation sector is the largest consum er o f biodiesel fuel. In 2003, Germany, France, Austria and Italy produced over two billion litres o f biodiesel and European car manufacturers, such as Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen, have approved biodiesel use for their European designed vehicles. In Europe, there is a healthy dem and for biodiesel, predominantly due to the support of the European Union (EU) and its farm production and environmental health programs and also energy security concerns (Raneses et al., 1999). The EU has poliees that allow farmers and farming cooperatives to grow crop feedstock for industrial and commercial uses, such as feedstock cultivation on `set aside' land. In France, there is a 5% biodiesel blend in all commercial diesel fuel (Boyd et al., 2004); A ustria and Germ any have many tax benefits that promote the use o f neat biodiesel in ecologically sensitive regions, such as mountainous areas and lakes (Raneses et al., 1999). In the U nited States, the urban transit market has been regulated as a result o f the Clean Air Act A m endm ents o f 1990; many urban fleets throughout the United States run on B20 (Prakash, 1998). One advantage o f biodiesel in public transportation is practicality; the fuel demand could be m et w ith a relatively few number o f filling stations as bus fleets are fuelled at centrally located areas. However, privately owned vehicles must rely on filling stations; biodiesel pumps m ay not be conveniently located.

M ining In the U nited States, m ost underground coal, metal and non-metal mines use diesel engines; diesel pow ered equipment is used to load, drill and transport material and personnel (Raneses et al, 1996). D iesel-powered machines are potentially less expensive to operate than other transport

10

Systems. Biodiesel could be a very feasible form o f fuel for the diesel powered equipment used in the mining industry. With greater use of diesel equipment, the potential advantages o f using biodiesel as a fuel source, also has related possible health and environmental benefits. In underground and surface mining, biodiesel could be used as a fuel and a dust suppressant (Raneses et al., 1996). Biodiesel releases less particulate matter into the air (Sheehan et al., 1998) for potential inhalation by miners. In addition, biodiesel has a higher flash point, which provides a safer working environment in the mining industry than diesel (Prakash, 1998). However, before biodiesel or biodiesel blends could be used in mining, their impacts on human, environmental and ecosystem health, relative to petroleum diesel, would need to be thoroughly examined.

Marine Environments Land transportation is not the only potential market for biodiesel use; biodiesel may have a considerable impact on marine transportation (Gustafson, 2003); many sea-going vessels rely on diesel as their primary source o f fuel. Biodiesel could be used to reduce soot, odour, particulate matter and exhaust emissions (Raneses et al., 1996). Also, biodiesel and biodiesel blends maybe better able to mitigate the dangers of diesel fuel leaks and spills on lakes, rivers and estuaries. Biodiesel and biodiesel blends can also find a sustainable market as a fuel for large recreational boats and vessels.

2.7 Biodiesel Properties Biodiesel is a reasonable alternative to diesel fuel; it is a fuel produced fi-om renewable resources and has lower exhaust emissions than conventional petroleum diesel. One gallon of biodiesel displaces 0.95 gallons o f diesel over its life cycle (Sheehan et al., 1998). It is also very energy

11

efficient, for every unit o f fossil energy used to produce biodiesel, 3.37 units o f biodiesel energy is created, it has a high energy yield when compared to fossil fuels; biodiesel also significantly reduces the amount o f carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere by diesel-engine vehicles.

Biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel; fuel bums more efficiently and this greatly improves the emissions profile o f a diesel engine. The more biodiesel used in a blend, the higher the emission reductions, in addition, biodiesel also releases less carbon dioxide than conventional diesel. Additionally, the crop feedstock used to produce biodiesel absorb large amounts o f carbon dioxide as they grow (Sheehan et al, 1998). One o f the unique benefits o f biodiesel is that it drastically reduces air toxins, such as sulphur oxides and carbon dioxide, which are associated w ith petroleum diesel exhaust and are suspected o f causing cancer and other hum an health problems.

Nitrogen oxide em issions are an exception to the rule, since biodiesel tends to increase nitrogen oxide emissions. Recent research has shown a number o f ways to mitigate this problem. Through the Trans-Esterification process, the conversion o f triglycerides into methyl or ethyl esters reduces the m olecular weight o f biodiesel to one-third, which reduces the viscosity by about one-eighth and slightly increases the volatility (Bamwal and Sharma, 2005). However, studies (Tyson, 2001) have suggested that some cold-flow starting problems persist in temperate conditions because biodiesel has low volumetric heating values, a high cetane number and a high flash point (Bam w al and Sharma, 2005). Nevertheless, biodiesel is rated as a strong candidate as an alternative to diesel.

12

Biodiesel is also safer to use than petroleum diesel; biodiesel has a higher flash point, neat biodiesel has a minimum flashpoint o f 127°C, compared to 53°C for regular no. 2 diesel (Dmytryshyn, et al, 2004). It also handles like diesel and is safe to transport and store, it does not require special storage, either in its pure form or in blends. Biodiesel and biodiesel blends can be stored in the same containment areas as diesel, with the exception of concrete-lined tanks. Like petroleum diesel, biodiesel operates in diesel engines; essentially no engine modifications are required and biodiesel offers comparable lubricity, horsepower and torque to petroleum diesel (Dmytryshyn et al., 2004).

2.8 Biodiesel Spills Biodiesel is becoming more prominent in North America; with the expected increase in use; the fate o f this green fuel is an area of concern since fuel spills constitute a major source o f contamination and pollution. According to the Environmental Protection Act; a spill is defined as "a discharge into a natural environment, from or out of a structure, vehicle or other container, and that is abnormal in quantity or quality in light of all the circumstances of the discharge" (Li, 2005). There are many causes of spills, including (i) vehicular and watercraft collisions, (ii) underground tank leaks (iii) discharges directly into watercourse, (iv) human error and negligence and (v) natural processes (flooding, land subsidence, earthquakes, slides). Among these concerns, water quality is one of the most important issues for living systems. Biodiesel consists o f mainly fatty acids; however, it is not desirable if ethyl or methyl esters accumulate in the waterways (Tyson et al., 1998). Consequently, biodegradability and toxicity of biodiesel fuels is o f interest, particularly if they accidentally enter into the aquatic environment in the course o f their transportation, use, storage or disposal.

13

Biodiesel is an alternative fuel derived from renewable organic material such as vegetable oils or ammal fats. V egetable oil and ammal fats spills do have deleterious effects on waterways; similarly, spills o f biodiesel could have some negative impacts on aquatic environments. Large discharges o f non-petroleum oils, as well as biodiesel, in an aquatic environment m ay cause significant oxygen depletion in waters due to rapid biodégradation rates. Like other petroleumbased products, discharges o f these substances could pollute water and endanger organisms living in freshw ater ecosystems.

A tw enty-year (1982-2002) trend analysis o f oil spills in EPA jurisdiction o f spills o f 50 gallons and m ore has indicated that 80% o f volume spills originated from pipelines (43%) and other facilities (37%), the other 20% o f spills came from other sources, for example, tank leakage and transportation accidents. Although, crude oils spills accounted for the greatest volume o f oil spilled (43%), light fuels, such as no. 2 diesel, accounted for the greatest number o f recorded oil spills (36%) in areas under EPA jurisdictions (Etkin, 2004). Diesel has a high frequency o f recorded accidents and spills, however, a trend analysis has not been conducted on spills o f biodiesel or biodiesel blends. If biodiesel becomes a commercially viable substitute for diesel, there m ay also be an increase o f biodiesel spills into the environment.

There is not m uch data on recorded biodiesel spills; however, biodiesel spills can still be com pared to petroleum oil spills. Biodiesel spills may generally be very small in volume due to the differences in the processing operations o f crude oil and biodiesel. Petroleum tankers can exceed 250000 torme capacity however; vegetable oils are usually carried in smaller tankers with a capacity o f approximately 3500 tonnes. Consequently, a vegetable oil or waste animal fat spill

14

may not be comparable in magnitude to a petroleum spill; the probability is very small. Transportation processes o f vegetable oils, waste animal fats and even yellow grease are also conducted at substantially different volumes and magmtudes than crude oils (Sagrans, 1998). Nevertheless, the frequency o f an feedstock or biodiesel accident occurring is still high because o f (i) the increasing number o f biodiesel processing plants, (ii) the location of plants near freshwater environments and (iii) biodiesel and feedstock transportation routes are mainly situated inland. Consequently, the impact of a biodiesel spill in waterways may have similar consequences to a petroleum- based oil spill in marine environments.

With the expected increase in biodiesel demand as an alternative ftiel source in North America, biodiesel production and biodiesel blending is also expected to increase. Increased use in the transportation sector may also lead to a rise in the number of accidental spills. Oil spills endanger public health, jeopardize drinking water supply, spoil natural resources, disturb ecosystems and disrupt the economy o f a country. Nations have become more dependent upon oil-based products to help maintain a certain standard of living. Petroleum based products and non-petroleum oils, such as vegetable oils and animal fats, are increasingly being consumed. With this increased consumption, there is more biodiesel being transported from process plants to filling stations. Consequently, there is a greater chance of these fuels being spilled into the aquatic environment. Spilled biodiesel can contain toxic components that can produce chemical and physiological effects that are similar to petroleum oils; biodiesel spills may pose many threats to public health and safety. Like any other transportation fuel, biodiesel and biodiesel blends are usually stored and transported in large volumes; during storage or transport or even production, oils and other

15

oil-based products are sometim es spilled onto land or into waterways. W hen this occurs, human health and environmental quality are put at risk.

2.9 Petroleum -Based Oil Spills in the Aquatic Rnvimnmpnt There is lim ited research on biodiesel or biodiesel blend spills; however, there are studies on diesel spills and vegetable oil spills. Although spills occur on land, particularly along transportation routes, crude and petroleum-based oil spills are very prevalent in m arine and freshwater ecosystem s (Cripps and Shears., 1996). The short and long term risk posed from accidental spillage during transportation and storage to the environment can be particularly high, especially in aquatic ecosystems (Cripps and Shears., 1996). The product loss from leaking tanks is a significant environmental problem and may be a point source o f groundwater and coastal zone contamination. These fuels m ay have deleterious effects on ecosystems, resulting in physical im pairm ent o f organisms and eventual mortality. According to the Alaska

Adm inistrative Code 2002, the toxicity o f petroleum, petroleum products and petroleum by products are classified as: (i) highly toxic (nos. 1 and 2 and artic diesel fuel, je t fuels A and B, m otor gasoline, kerosene and stationary turbine fuels); (ii) moderately toxic (waste oil and lubricating oil); (iii) less toxic (bunker oil and hydraulic oil) and relatively non-toxic (asphalt and tars) (M oham m ed, 2005). All o f these oil types are transported by either trucks or tankers; both terrestrial and aquatic environments are at risk.

M ost research on the fate and effects o f oil entering the aquatic environment has focused on m arine ecosystem s, as m ost o f the large oil spills that have received much attention have occurred in m arine environments. Similar concern for freshwater aquatic ecosystems has been lacking. N evertheless, oil spills do occur in freshwater areas as a consequence o f the m any oil-

16

related activities in this type o f environment. It is important that fuel spills in freshwater habitats be addressed; one o f the major sources of diesel oil spills is due to storage and transportation accidents.

Crude oil in freshwater environments is of particular concern because of its large retention time in aquatic environments. Oil retention times in marshes, swamps and other low energy environments are longer than oil spilled on high-energy coastlines (Bhattacharyya et al., 2003). Spilled crude oil may be present in sediments at low energy sites long after the occurrence o f the spills; in addition, oil could be released into the water column many years after the initial spill. Water-column species and sediment-inhabiting species may both be affeeted by crude oil spilled in aquatic environments. Fuel may have both acute and chronie effects on freshwater ecosystems; chronic effects on water-column species include neurosensory disruption, behavioural and developmental abnormalities and reduced fertility (Bhattacharyya et al., 2003). Oil-based products spilled in waterways may limit oxygen exchange; acute effects include coating o f the gills and skin, creating respiratory problems and death for many organisms.

Many studies have addressed the toxicity of crude oils and fuel oils on a variety of marine organisms. In comparison to the number of marine studies conducted on the effects of petroleum fuels, relatively few investigations have been done on freshwater habitats and organisms. Under marine conditions, wave aetion and surface turbulence are usually high, the volume and depth of water affected is usually large and the land-water interface comparatively small. Bhattacharyya et al (2003) have suggested that there is little surface turbulence, smaller volume and depth of water and the land-water interface is larger in freshwater environments when compared to

17

m anne areas. Consequently, processes such as water mixing and dilution are usually limited in freshwater systems and infiltration o f spills into surrounding areas may be increased. Conditions such as reduced turbulence and mixing increase the retention time o f spilled hydrocarbons in the environment; the longer spilled oil is present, the greater the environmental damage. Another factor that has an effect on toxicity is the type o f organisms exposed to toxins; marine and freshw ater organism s are physiologically different; marine and freshwater organisms m ay be resistant to different types o f pollutants. This can lead to a possible shift in species diversity; particularly towards a pollutant-tolerant species dominating the affected area. Unfortunately, very httle research has been done on the effectiveness and toxicity implications for freshwater biodiesel oil spills on freshwater organisms.

W hen petroleum -based hydrocarbons are spilled into an aquatic environment, toxins can affect organism s that live in or around the water surface as well as those that live underwater. Oil spills can also harm parts o f the food chain, including human food resources. Aquatic environments are seriously threatened by a variety o f human activities. Many studies have shown that the extent o f dam age to stream flora and fauna following accidental oil spills is diverse and complex. The effect o f a pollutant in aquatic environments depend on: (i) the chemical characteristics o f the petrochem ical involved (ii) the volume and severity o f the spill (iii) the nature o f the receiving w ater and its biota and the (iv) physical and natural conditions o f the ecosystem affected, such as tem perature and weather (Lytle and Peckarsky, 2001).

Oil consists o f heavy insoluble compounds and lighter soluble compounds, crude oil containing heavy insoluble compounds is generally more persistent than lighter water soluble oils that

18

evaporate faster, however, lighter compounds are also h i ^ y toxic. The insoluble fraction can combine with the particulate organic matter or inorganic matter on the stream bed resulting in persistently toxic effects or an increased consumption of oxygen by bacteria during decomposition (Mudge, 1995). However, some studies suggest that exposure to water soluble fractions o f oil causes more mortality than exposure to the products of oil degradation in sediment residues (Lytle and Peckarsky, 2001). As a result, it is very important to study the acute effects o f oil and oil-based byproducts on aquatic ecosystems. Stream discharge also plays an important role in determining the extent o f damage caused by oil spills; smaller streams are more susceptible than larger streams. Oil spills in streams and rivers with low discharge can create very deleterious effects to aquatic habitats; particularly areas in close vicinity to the source o f the spill. Also, high volume spills cause more damage than smaller ones. However, turbulent flow at the time of a spill can enhance dispersion of chemicals, thereby affecting the spatial extent and immediate impact of the toxins on organisms. In contrast, scouring flows have been shown to accelerate recovery from oil spills not only by removing oil from the sediment but also by enhancing the recolonization of stream biota from upstream (Lytle and Peckarsky, 2001). Unfortunately, many small streams and other low energy areas have minimal scouring and erosional processes present.

Natural processes and physical conditions are present in all aquatic environments; these can reduce the severity o f an oil spill and accelerate the recovery of an affected area. Some natural processes include weathering, evaporation, oxidation, photo-oxidation, biodégradation and émulsification. The intensity and extent of some of these natural processes may differ in freshwater ecosystems when compared with marine environments. Freshwater environmental

19

im pacts can b e m ore severe because water movement is decreased in these habitats. In standing w ater bodies, oil tends to pool and can remain in the environment for long periods o f time. In flow ing stream s and rivers, oil tends to collect on sediments, as well as, plants and grasses grow ing on the banks and on the stream and river beds. These hydrocarbons can also interact w ith the sedim ent at the bottom o f the freshwater bodies, affecting organisms that live in or feed o ff sediments.

Plant, anim al and hum an exposure to toxic substances is generally reduced with time and is usually lim ited to the initial spill area since oil spill toxins may evaporate or biodegrade quickly. Both petroleum and non-petroleum oil can affect the environment surrounding an oil spill; all petroleum hydrocarbons possess similar chemical and physical properties thiàt produce com parable effects on the environment. Some studies have shown that non-petroleum oil spills, such as plant and vegetable oils, can produce comparable effects as petroleum oil spills. '

2.10 V egetable Oil Spills in the Aquatic Environment Vegetable oils are classified as non-petroleum oils; vegetable oils are commonly used as feedstock in biodiesel production (Van Gerpen, 2004). Research concerning the effects o f vegetable oils in the m arine and freshwater environment is limited when compared with the num ber o f studies conducted on crude oil spills. Vegetable oils are transported and stored in sim ilar w ays to petroleum oils and the likelihood o f spills o f vegetable oils is no different from that o f petroleum oils (Pereira et al., 2002). The lack o f research on the effects o f vegetable oils spills is possibly due to the assumption that vegetable oils are easily metabolized by organisms

20

and therefore are considered less harmful than crude oil spills or even that some renewable oils are more easily biodegraded than the more persistent petroleum-based oils (Pereira et al., 2002).

Large quantities of vegetable oils are transported from production sites to consumption areas, creating the possibility of spills to aquatic environments. Contamination can be caused by small spills during loading and unloading; acute pollution can be caused by shipping accidents. Large spills o f vegetable oils have been reported all over the world. Pereira et al. (2003) have done extensive research on vegetable oil spills, some examples of spills include 2.5 million gallons o f soybean oil spilled into the Minnesota River and Upper Mississippi River in 1963, a spill o f 10 000 tormes o f palm and coconut oil and edible raw material occurred in 1975 on Farming Island in the Pacific Ocean. Other examples include a palm oil spill in The Netherlands and a 400 gallon spill o f rapeseed oil during the winter of 1989 in Vancouver Harbour, Canada. Although these spills caused many adverse effects to birds, fish and other aquatic organisms, vegetable oils have not been as extensively studied as those of crude oils.

Although not much research has been conducted in terms of biodiesel spills, there have been many studies involving petroleum-based oil and some on vegetable oil spills. Mudge (1995) has researched vegetable oil spills in marine environments, which has led to three main areas o f concern about any such spillage. Sublethal effects on the environment may be caused by (i) Smothering (ii) Direct Toxicity and (iii) Polymerization of the oils with the sediments. Most vegetable oils float on water because of their lower density. When vegetable oils spill into waterways they reduce the oxygen exchange across the air-water interface, reducing oxygen supply by the process o f smothering. Besides oxygen depletion, oils may adhere to organisms.

21

resulting in injury and even death. Direct toxicity m ay cause sublethal effects in organisms; these sublethal effects include reduced growth, suffocation, genetic variations and changes in reproductive cycles m ay also occur (Mudge, 1995). Polymerised oil decreases bacterial degradation; over tim e some polymerised oils form an impermeable cap over sediments, anoxic conditions m ay develop below the surface; this change in available oxygen may lead to a change in species diversity (Mudge, 1995). It can be postulated that similar effects m ay occur to freshw ater organisms. Biodiesel is also produced from animal fats and waste cooking oils. However, research is lim ited on the influence o f these feedstocks in aquatic environments.

2.11 Biodiesel and Biodegradabilitv M illion o f tonnes o f oil are spilled each year into the environment during transport, storage and processing. For example, the Exxon Valdez incident in 1989 released 11.2 million gallons o f crude oil into the Alaskan region (Biswas et al., 2005). As interest in biodiesel increases, their fate in aquatic environments is an area o f relevance since fuel spills constitute a major source o f contam ination o f m any ecosystems (Zhang et al., 1995). It is important to examine biodegradability concepts in terms o f biodiesel fuels and their biodégradation rates. Research on biodiesel biodegradability is limited, however, one study was found, which dealt with comparing two types o f biodiesel with diesel.

It was determ ined that biodiesel has desirable degradation attributes, studies at the University o f Idaho have been conducted to determine the biodégradation o f biodiesel in an aqueous solution. Biodiesel, in particular, rapeseed methyl and rapeseed ethyl esters, was compared to diesel fuel and dextrose (Zhang et al., 1995). The biodegradability project examined chemical oxygen

22

demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), biodégradation in aqueous solutions and biodégradation in soils. It is generally better if COD and BOD data have very low values because it indicates how mueh of this material is in water, sewage or in an effluent (Biswas et al, 2005). However, when biodégradation is of interest and it is desirable to have the toxin break down very quickly, high BOD and COD would be desired.

According to the studies performed, rapeseed methyl and ethyl esters have high COD and BOD values; biodégradation was determined in an aqueous solution using a 28 day shake flask test. Both esters degraded more rapidly than the dextrose control, the esters degraded at almost identieal rates to about 95% at the end of 28 days. The diesel fuel in this test was approximately 40% biodegraded after 28 days. Although neat biodiesel has a high biodegradability rate in comparison to conventional diesel fuel, there may be acute short term risk associated with large volumes o f biodiesel and biodiesel blend spillage (Zhang et al., 1995). The two types of biodiesel used in the study were produced from a vegetable oil feedstock. Research on biodegradability of biodiesel produced from waste animal fats and spent cooking oil is very limited.

2.12 Economie Analvsis For the past decade, many eountries have been confronted with fossil fuel idepletion and environmental degradation; these two predieaments have sparked interest in alternative fuels. Alternative fuels, energy conservation, energy efficiency and environmental proteetion have become pertinent issues regarding natural resource management (Bamwal and Sharma, 2005). There is an interest in biodiesel production because of the (i) increasing demand for liquid (biofuel) energy, (ii) continuing surpluses of agricultural commodities and (iii) rural

23

com m unities seeking diversification opportunities from mainstream farming (Radich, 2004). Studies have suggested that world oil consumption will increase primarily due to the growth in consum ption o f transportation fuels. Increased production o f biodiesel could partially alleviate this increasing crude oil deficit.

2.12.1 Econom ic Factors Inform ation on the economic feasibility o f biodiesel is limited. It is difficult to determine feasibility because o f the complexity o f all the factors involved in biodiesel production and marketing. Several feasibility studies have evaluated the market potential and economic costs o f producing biodiesel, m ost using vegetable oil as the primary feedstock. Others excluded cost elem ents such as land and property taxes, administration, transportation and market

developm ent. Nevertheless, some fundamental analysis is possible based solely on economic factors.
I

To determ ine the feasibility o f biodiesel as an alternative source o f energy, economic input and econom ic output factors should be considered. Biodiesel costs are segmented according to fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are estimated for extracting the vegetable oil from seed and for processing the oilseed into biodiesel (Engui'danos, 2002). Variable costs depend on the (i) type o f raw m aterials used, (ii) type o f oil extraction process and (iii) size o f overall biodiesel operation.

The m ajor econom ic input factor in biodiesel production is the feedstock costs (Enguldanos, 2002). Feasibility o f biodiesel production is predominantly determined by which type o f organic feedstock is used in the Trans-Esterification process. Technologies and processes involved in biodiesel m anufacture m ay vary. Nevertheless, the greatest share o f the production expense is the

24

feedstock cost; feedstock cost is the major barrier to the feasibility of biodiesel in urban and rural markets (Bender, 1999). Raw material costs account for a major portion o f the total manufacturing cost, which is approximately 80 percent of the total operating cost (Enguldanos, 2002). Reduction o f the raw material cost would optimize the total manufacturing cost. The type of feedstock used also foreshadows biodiesel prices. Some studies have shown that biodiesel made from non-edible oils such as waste animal fats are less expensive than edible oils such as canola, sunflower and rapeseed oils (Bender, 1999). Virgin oil costs approximately 2-3 times more than waste oils, such as restaurant cooking oils and by-products from livestock processing plants; the use o f virgin oil leads to a significant increase in total manufacturing cost (Zhang et al., 2003).

The important economic output factors for biodiesel production are the end products, break-even price and regulations and initiatives. Besides biodiesel, glycerin is the other major end product; glycerin is widely used as an ingredient or processing aid in the cosmetic, drug and food industries. The profits from reusing glycerin can be used to offset cost incurred by the feedstock as well as other raw materials used in biodiesel production (Prakash, 1998). Break-even prices may vary from one biodiesel processing facility to another depending on the scale of the operation. Plants are classified into three groups (i) community, (ii) industrial and (iii) large industrial; the size of the operation has an influence on cost (Bender, 1999), differences in fixed and variable costs create elastic break-even prices. Other important economic factors include regulations and initiatives, these procedures will vary from one country to another (Prakash, 1998).

25

2.12.2 Econom ie Feasibility o f Biodiesel

:

Biodiesel produced from vegetable oils is currently not economically feasible; the economics o f biodiesel are unstable due to the large feedstock cost. Also, factors such as capital costs, electricity and w ater costs and glycerin credit can significantly affect biodiesel production costs (Bender, 1999). Econom ic feasibility studies show that the biodiesel obtained from non-edible oils is cheaper than that from edible oils (Bamwal and Sharma, 2005). Biodiesel manufactured from non-edible oils, such as waste animal fats, is closer to being cost competitive with petroleum diesel than biodiesel produced from vegetable oils, such as soybean oil. However, the currently available supply o f such yellow greases will probably limit its use for successful long term biodiesel production (Radich, 2004). Prices o f edible oils, such as vegetable oils, need to decrease considerably in order for large quantities o f biodiesel to become competitive with petroleum diesel prices. f The econom ic feasibility o f biodiesel also depends on the price o f cmde oil and the cost o f transporting diesel over long distances to remote areas. The cost o f diesel will increase in the future due to the increase in its demand and limited supply (Bamwal and Sharma, 2005). Low production costs o f crude oil derivatives are another significant limitation for biodiesel success. Increasing crude oil prices may open the biodiesel market; biodiesel demand may increase biodiesel production. Production costs m ay be lowered to levels where biodiesel prices at the gas pum ps are com parable to those o f fossil diesel. Fluctuating crude oil prices may become a potential opportunity for enhancing biodiesel demand in selective niche markets (Enguldanos,

2002).

26

Important factors for feasible biodiesel production are in place for the industry to succeed: such as environmental concerns with diesel fuel, diminishing petroleum reserves and awareness of the increased environmental consequences of emissions from diesel and gas-fuelled engines. A viable biodiesel industry in North America has potential benefits including: (i) increased feedstock value for oilseeds, animal fats and yellow grease, (ii) increased employment rates, (particularly in rural areas) and (iii) increased tax base from plant processing operations as well as income tax benefits and investments from feedstock processing ventures.

2.13 Present Biodiesel Status Biodiesel has been established in Europe as the leading alternative fuel source, in North America, enthusiasm for biodiesel has been slow but growing. At present, biodiesel price is the main hindrance to its success in North America. The cost of biodiesel without tax in North America is about 2 to 3 times more than the selling price of diesel (Prakash, 1998). This gap can be reduced by offering subsidies to biodiesel or by imposing additional taxes on conventional diesel fuel. Additionally, the cost of biodiesel could be reduced by employing lower cost feedstocks, such as animal fats and waste grease or through innovative technologies, such as biodiesel treated with supercritical methanol. The engine and vehicle manufacturers in North America have not yet approved the use of biodiesel blends greater than B5 in their products (Holbein et al., 2004). However, the biodiesel industry in the United States is pursuing a number of initiatives to promote and expand the use of biodiesel, such as the Biodiesel Tax Incentive and the Energy Bill. The tax incentive, established originally as part of the American JOBS Creation Act o f 2004, has been extended until 2008. The excise tax credit provides an incentive to fuel

27

distributors to blend biodiesel into diesel fuel, such as that made from soybean oil and recycled cooking oil (ENN, 2005).

The U.S. Energy Bill provides incentives and credits for alternative fuel installations; the bill also supports demonstration and testing projects for biodiesel use. The Energy Bill also promotes the U.S. departm ents o f the Interior, Commerce and Agriculture to use energy efficient vehicle technologies, including biodiesel. The Energy Bill states that biodiesel is eligible for the Clean Bus EPA program; for example, those implemented for school buses (ENN, 2005). These activities should have some positive impact on biodiesel use in Canada. There is great prospects for biodiesel use in Canada, particularly in the mining industry, marine and transportation sectors (Prakash, 1998).

3. MATERIALS AND M ETHOD

f

3.1 Thesis Objectives Various types o f habitats have differing sensitivities to spills, either from petroleum-based oils or oils produced from vegetable oils, animal fats or yellow grease. There has been an increased interest in the use of biodiesel as a potential fuel and a feasible alternative to diesel fuel. However, like diesel fuel, any fuel could accidentally be spilled into rivers, lakes and oceans. Aquatic environments are made up of complex interactions between plant and animal species and their physical environment. Harm to the physical environment will often lead to harm to one or more species in a food chain, which may lead to damage for other species further up the chain, particularly humans.

This thesis addresses the effect of different biodiesel blends on aquatic organisms; diesel fuel is refined, stored and transported throughout estuarine, coastal ecosystems as well as freshwater environments which include watersheds and wetlands. These ecosystems provide essential habitat for aquatic species; which are vulnerable to accidental fuel and oil spills. Even though natural oozes of crude oil occur in the ocean floor and stable marine biotic communities are associated with them, the sudden introduction of high concentrations o f oil or oil-based products can potentially kill or cause sublethal effects in some aquatic organisms.

Biodiesel has been proposed as a possible alternative source o f fuel; an alternative to conventional diesel fuel. Diesel spills account for many spills, particularly along transportation routes, if biodiesel is being considered as a diesel substitute; biodiesel may also prone to such spills. Consequently, it is important to study the impacts o f such energy alternatives on the

29

environment, toxicological studies are necessary to evaluate the potential impact o f biodiesel and biodiesel blends on aquatic orgamsms and the freshwater environment. Unfortunately, there is a discerning lack o f information concerning the acute toxicity o f biodiesel and biodiesel blends on freshw ater organisms.

The aim o f this study was to determine the effects o f biodiesel and biodiesel blends on the freshwater aquatic environment. Toxic effects o f neat biodiesel and biodiesel blends were compared to conventional diesel fuel. Aquatic toxicity testing used in this study involved static non-renewal bioassays. In static non-renewal tests, the toxin is introduced into the test water at the beginning o f the test and then the water is not changed during the duration duration o f the test may vary with the organism o f the test.The

being tested. The organisms used in this

experim ent w ere the water flea, Daphnia magna (D. magna) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (O. my kiss), com m only referred to as rainbow trout. Acute toxicity was generally measured using a multi-concentration test, consisting o f a control and a minimum o f six and five toxin

concentrations for D. magna juveniles and O. mykiss ftys respectively.

The thesis undertaken examines the influence o f different concentrations o f neat biodiesel and biodiesel blends (B20, B50 and B5) on two freshwater organisms; D. magna juveniles and O. mykiss (rainbow trout) fry. Acute toxicity testing was done with different concentrations o f biodiesel, biodiesel blends and diesel fuel. The purpose o f this study was to determine (i) the mortality rate o f biodiesel and biodiesel blends (B50, B20, and B5), (ii) the LC50 values o f neat biodiesel and biodiesel blends after different exposure times and (iii) the relationship and

30

significance o f biodiesel results obtained to conventional diesel fuel. The two endpoints o f the testing were (i) mortality rate and (ii) lethal concentration (LC50) values at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs.

To determine the relative toxicity of certain chemicals on an aquatic organism, an acute toxicity test was conducted to estimate the lethal concentration of the toxin. The tests were designed to provide concentration-response information, expressed as the toxin concentration that is lethal to 50% o f the test organisms (LC50) within the prescribed period o f time (24-96 hrs). The measured endpoints of the static non-renewal test were mortality rate and LC50. A 24hr-LC50 toxicity test was conducted on D. magna juveniles and a 96hr-LC50 was conducted on O. mykiss fiys, according to the EPA guidelines outlined in the Methods fo r Measuring the Acute Toxicity o f Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms. Most oil toxicity studies have focused on early life stages of test species because these stages are generally more sensitive to toxic effects than adults.

3.2 Acute Toxicity Test Acute toxicity is the apparent adverse effect induced in an organism within a short time of exposure to a substance or chemical. In the tests performed, acute toxicity was expressed as the median lethal concentration (LC50); the concentration in a water medium which kills 50% o f the test organisms within a continuous period of exposure. For this study, acute toxicity was measured using a multi-concentration definitive test; consisting of a control and a m inim um o f five sample concentrations. The tests were designed to provide concentration-response information, expressed as concentration that is lethal to 50% of the test organisms, also referred to as the LC50 within the preseribed period o f time, usually between 24 and 96 hrs. Static non

31

renewal tests w ere used in this study, this type o f test involved the test organisms being exposed to the same test solution for the entire duration o f the test. Static non-renewal tests were utilized because this type o f test is simple and inexpensive, little space and equipment is needed and small volumes o f fuel concentrations are required (EPA, 2002). This type o f testing was also chosen because only toxic effects in a freshwater (small stream) situation over a short time period was considered in the study.

3.3 Bioassav The test organisms were exposed to static non-renewal testing which involved a m ulti concentration test used to determine the effects o f acute toxin exposure. Bioassays were perform ed to determine the LC50 o f both D. magna and O. mykiss under the influence o f different biodiesel blends and diesel fuel. This bioassay used static non-renewal tests; this type o f test involved the test organisms being exposed to the same test solution for the duration o f the test. The test solutions involved are conventional diesel, neat biodiesel and biodiesel blends o f B20, B50 and B5 in a water medium.

3.4 Bioassav Organisms The two bioassay organisms used were the water flea D. magna and O. mykiss, commonly referred to as rainbow trout; young organisms are often more sensitive to toxicants than are adults. For this reason, the use o f early life stages, such as daphnid juveniles and fish swim-up fi*y, was required for all tests. In a given test, all orgamsms had similar physiological characteristics and were approximately the same age and were taken from the same source. Since

32

age may affect the results o f the tests, it enhanced the value and comparability o f the data when the same species in the same life stages were used throughout the experiment (EPA, 2002).

3.4.1 Daphnia magna Daphnia magna {D. magna) is a small crustacean, often referred to as a water flea, which is barely visible with the naked eye. It lives in water and has large antennae in comparison with the rest o f its body. D. magna is used as a bio-indicator and it is often used to measure the toxicity of a chemical compound in water. This species is often used in LC50 measurements. D. magna has a worldwide distribution in the northern hemisphere; D. magna found throughout many parts of Canada and the United States (EPA, 2002).

3.4.2 Oncorhynchus mykiss Fish may be exposed to pollutants in different ways; they may come into (i) direct or (ii) indirect contact. Toxins may contaminate their gills and other external appendages, in addition, the water column may contain toxic and volatile components of fuel that may be absorbed by their eggs and juvenile stages; fish may also be affected by eating contaminated food, which may include algae, plankton or even other fish. Fish that are exposed to petroleum-based hydrocarbons may suffer from heart and respiratory problems, fin erosion, reduced growth and reproductive and behavioural responses (EPA, 2002). Some studies have shown that chronic exposure to some chemicals present in oil may cause genetic abnormalities or cancer in some sensitive fish species. For this project, O. mykiss young were used; acute exposure was measured by mortality. O. mykiss are a variable species that differ considerably over their range. The native range o f the

33

rainbow trout group in North America is west o f the Rocky Mountains and along the eastern Pacific Ocean but O. mykiss has been introduced into many parts o f North America. Rainbow trout has also been widely introduced and established in other cold water habitats all over the world (EPA, 2002).

The fish should be in good health and fi-ee fi'om any apparent physical deformity or disease. The species used were selected on reason, such as availability, maintenance, testing convenience and sensitivity to chemicals (EPA, 2002). The testing used O. mykiss as the preferred fish species because o f its worldwide availability, moderate fat content and adaptability to tresh or sea water (Environment Canada, 2000).

The procedures o f the experimental work were divided into two sections; (i) toxicity effects o f fuel concentrations on D. magna juveniles and (ii) toxicity effects o f fuel concentrations on O. mykiss fry s. Lethality and other toxic effects o f a chemical are dependent on both concentration and exposure tim e (Lee et al., 1995). The toxicity o f biodiesel and biodiesel blends was investigated using acute toxicity tests; a comparison was made to diesel fuel toxicity. For both daphnids and fish, this was done by observing lethality resulting from exposure to a series o f chemical concentrations, at 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours.

34

3.5 Experimental Organisms Daphnids

h

r / , = >'

Two different types o f daphnids were used, D. magna and D. pulex. Daphnids were obtained from Carolina Biological Supply Ltd and Ward's Natural Science. Daphmds were maintained and cultured at 20±1°C. The photoperiod consisted of 16 hours o f light and 8 hours of darkness.

O. mykiss (Rainbow Trout) Rainbow trout (O. mykiss) (weighing between 0.5-1.Og) were obtained from two local suppliers (Linwood Acres Trout Farm Ltd, Campbellcroft, ON, and Blue Springs Trout Farms Ltd, Hanover, ON). Although, there was two different fish stock, there was no mixing o f the stocks throughout the experiments. All fish were maintained at 12±2°C. Fish acclimation, in terms of temperature, was tested for exposures between 8 and 23 °C. Fish were acclimated at 12±2°C for fourteen days prior to use. Water temperature was regulated to within 2 °C of the desired test temperature by a refrigerator. Photoperiod was 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. The fish stocks were fed daily with commercially prepared trout pellets obtained from Linwood Acres Trout Farm Ltd.

3.6 Test Chemicals The fuels used in the bioassays were conventional diesel, BlOO and biodiesel blends, the biodiesel blends included B50, B20 and B5. Biodiesel blends were made from the same BlOO feedstock.

3.7 Equipm ent & Material Sample containers, culture units, analytical balance, test chambers, volumetric flasks & graduated cylinders (10-1000ml), volumetric pipettes (1-100ml), graduated serological pipettes (1-10ml), graduate micropipettes (1-5pi), pipette bulb & fillers, droppers, wash bottles, thermometers (for m easuring water temperature and environmental temperature), DO meter, pH meter, pH buffers (4,7, 10), Sources o f food for cultures and stock organisms, dip nets, test organisms; D. magna juveniles and O. mykiss fiys, holding tanks, deionised distilled water (DDI), Refirigerator.

3.8 Phvsiochemical Parameters The pH, tem perature and dissolved oxygen content o f the various concentrations and the control water were the physicochemical parameters measured in this study.

3.9 Source o f Toxins BlOO w as obtained firom Rothsay; a rendering company, BlOO was made from recycled cooking oils and fats. B20 (Topia) was a B20 blend commercially blended by Topia Energy Ltd. and obtained at a local filling station. Diesel was obtained from the same local gas station.

3.10 Biodiesel Blending The chemical nature o f biodiesel allows it to be blended with distillate and diesel fuel, this includes light fuels such as jet fuel, kerosene, no.l diesel, or military fuels (JP8, JP5), as well as normal diesel fuel like no. 2 diesel for diesel engines. Biodiesel is blended thoroughly with diesel

36

fuel; if maintained at temperatures above its cloud point, biodiesel blends stay mixed (Tyson, 2001). Biodiesel mixes well with diesel fuel in any proportion and stays blended even in cold temperatures. Biodiesel tends to store as well as diesel fuel. Consequently, mixed fuels were stored at room temperature in fuel storage containers. Biodiesel blends of B20, B50 and B5 were made with BlOO feedstock. Blends were made by a procedure called splash blending; specific amounts o f BlOO were `splashed' (poured on top) on specific amounts of diesel fuel and then agitated. B20 Blending A fuel storage container was filled with 8 litres of diesel, and then 2 litres o f BlOO was poured into the fuel container. B50 Blending A fuel storage container was filled with 5 litres of diesel, and then 5 litres o f BlOO B was poured into the fuel container. B5 Blending A fuel storage container was filled with 9.5 litres o f diesel, and then 0.5 litres o f BlOO was poured into the fuel container.

3.11 Common Method Testing Procedures and analytical tools used in the acute toxicity tests performed with both D. magna and O. mykiss followed guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Methods fo r Measuring the Acute Toxicity o f Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms. Testing used in this study, solely involved BlOO, B50, B20, B5 and diesel; the effects o f components of diesel was not tested but the effects of diesel was compared to biodiesel and biodiesel blends. Although oil spills are dynamic in nature and may change chemically and physically over a period o f time; this study examined the acute toxic effects of biodiesel and diesel concentrations over a short period o f time.

37

3.12 D aphnia m agna Acute Toxicity Test

.

Each 24 hour D. magna test involved placing groups o f D. magna juveniles into a range o f test substance concentrations and environmental control to which the daphnids were acclimated. Toxicity tests with D. magna were conducted in 200 ml samplers. For each concentration including controls, 4 replicate test chambers were used. All tests were conducted at 20 ± TC. Tests w ere conducted under static conditions with no renewal of the test solution. For all tests, tem perature and photoperiod were similar to those o f culture and holding conditions and kept constant between all tests. Observations for immobility and mortality were recorded after 24 hours. A daphnid was considered to be dead if there was no movement. The fuel was stirred into the water before the D. magna were introduced into the test chamber. There was a slight sheen o f fuel on the top o f some test chambers.

3.12.1 Daphnids Test Procedure A range-finding test was followed by a definitive test; this type o f test was performed in order to obtain inform ation about the range o f concentrations to be used in the main test. A static non renewal test was done; trials o f control without any test substances were conducted as well as trials o f different concentrations o f diesel, BlOO and B20. Daphnids were exposed to the substance for a 24 hour duration. Temperature ranged within 20±1°C among test trials, the daphnids were not fed during the 24hr test period. The daphnids were inspected after the first 2 to 4 hours and at the 24-hour interval. Daphnids were considered dead if touching did not produce any reaction and no breathing movements were visible. Dead daphnids were removed when observed and mortalities were recorded.

38

3.12.2 D. magna Test Concentrations A 24hr bioassay using the water flea, D. magna was conducted for this study. The fuels used were diesel, biodiesel (BlOO) and biodiesel blends of B20, B50 and B5. Range-finding tests on different concentrations were first performed; from the results obtained; definitive concentrations were then tested. Four trials were performed for each concentration; the concentrations tested for trials 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 1.57, 3.13, 6.25, 12.5 and 50ppm with DDI water as the control. All concentrations o f the fuels tested were measured in parts per million (ppm).

3.12.3 Supplier ofD . magna The D. magna were obtained from Carolina Biological Supply and W ard's Science Ltd. All organisms tested were fed and maintained during culturing and acclimation. The test organisms appeared vigorous and in good condition prior to testing. The D. magna were placed below the test surface at test initiation due to the slight sheen of some test samples observed in the rangefinding tests.

3.12.4 Equipment and Test Chambers Separate holding and toxicity testing were conducted to prevent any loss o f cultures due to cross contamination (EPA, 2002). Water used for holding and test samples were DDI water left to stand for 5 days. During culturing and testing, daphnids were shielded from external disturbances such as pedestrian traffic. All material was thoroughly rinsed before use in the test trials.

39

3.12.5 Test Conditions The tem perature o f the test solutions was measured by placing a thermometer into the samples. Temperature was recorded at test initiation and test termination. Test solution temperatures were maintained within the limits specified for trials.

3.12.6 Num ber o f Test Organisms Five daphnids were exposed to each concentration; in the toxicity test performed six concentrations and one environmental control (seven concentrations x 20 organisms per concentration) were included in a test trial; four trials were performed. Daphnids were captured firom a common pool and distributed sequentially to the test chambers. Excessive h ^ d lin g and carryover o f culture water was avoided by placing the tip o f the transfer pipettes below the surface o f the water in the test chambers and allowing the organisms to swim out o f the pipettes without discharging the contents.

3.12.7 Replicate Test Chambers Four test chambers were provided for each substance concentration as well as the control to increase data quality. The data fi'om these replicate chambers were combined to determine the (i) m ortality rate and (ii) lethal concentration (LC50).

3.12.8 Quality o f Test Organisms The health o f daphnids was assessed by the performance (survival, growth and reproduction) o f D. magna in culture tanks and control tests; notes on such performances were maintained.

3.12.9 Food Quality

/

The quality o f the food used in culturing and testing invertebrates is an important factor in the study, daphnid food pellets were obtained from Carolina Biological Supply Ltd.

3.12.10 Culturing Procedure Immediately upon receiving the daphnid culture, the daphnia culture was examined to determine if the culture arrived in satisfactory condition; health was determined by actively swimming daphnids. If the D. magna culture arrived in satisfactory condition, the lid was opened to permit air exchange. The daphnia culture was placed in an undisturbed location that was shielded from direct sunlight. A 1-gallon plastic aquarium was filled with DDI water, the aquarium water was allowed to stabilize for 24hrs; temperature was maintained at 20± 1°C. The lids from the jars o f D. magna were removed and the jars were slowly submerged in the aquarium.

Daphnid culturing guidelines were taken from Methods fo r Measuring the Acute Toxicity o f Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms (EPA, 2002). Once the jar was completely filled and underwater, the culture of daphnia was gently turned into the aquarium. This prevented air bubbles from becoming trapped under the carapaces of the daphnids (EPA, 2002). Dried daphnia food pellets were sprinkled into the aquarium; the daphnids were fed every other day. Aerated DDI water was used as the culture medium, DO content in the culture were maintained above 6 mg/1; aeration of the culture medium was not necessary. A minimum of 16hr of illumination was provided each day. Two culture chambers were maintained to ensure back-up cultures were present so that in the event of a population `crash' in one o f the culture chamber (EPA, 2002), the entire D. magna population will not be

41

lost. All culture containers were washed thoroughly, after the culture was established, each chamber was cleaned weekly o f accumulated food, debris and dead daphnids. The medium in each stock culture vessel was replaced two times each week with fresh medium (EPA, 2002).

3.12.11 M ortality o f Culture Tank Following a 24hr acclimation period, mortalities of the stock daphnid population were recorded. M ortalities are recorded at a 24-hour interval and the concentrations killing 50% o f the daphnids (LC50) at 24hrs was calculated. For acceptable results, the mortality in the culture tanks and controls did not exceed 10% by the end of the test period.

3.13 Acute Toxicity o f Fish Test procedures were similar to those for the LC50 D. magna toxicity test; The LC50 toxicity test involved placing groups o f fish (10 per concentration) in a range of concentrations o f different fuels. The tests were conducted at controlled temperatures o f 12 ± 2 "C. Solutions were gently aerated throughout the 96 hour exposure period. Tests were conducted under static conditions with no renewal o f the test solution. For all tests, temperature and photoperiod were sim ilar to those o f holding conditions and kept constant throughout all tests. Observations for im m obility and m ortality were recorded after 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. A fish was considered dead if there was no evidence o f opercular activity and it showed no response to gentle prodding.

A range-finding test was followed by a definitive test, in order to obtain information about the range o f concentrations to be used in the main test. A static non-renewal bioassay was performed; trials with control (DDI water), i.e., without the test substance, diesel, BlOO and B20 were performed. Fish were exposed to the toxins and the control for a period of 96 hours. There was a temperature range o f 12± 2"C for any particular test trial; the O. mykiss were not fed during the 96hr test period. The fish were inspected after the first 2 to 3 hours and at consecutive 24-hour intervals thereafter. Dead fish were removed when observed and mortalities were recorded. Visible abnormalities, such as changes in swimming behaviour and pigmentation change were noted. Measurements of pH and temperature were carried out daily.

3.13.2 O. mykiss Test Concentrations Range-finding tests on different concentrations were first performed; fi'om the results obtained; definitive concentrations were then tested. Two trials were done for each concentration; the concentrations tested for trials 1 and 2 were 100, 300, 600, 900 and 1200 ppm with DDI water as the control. All concentrations of the test substance were given in parts per million (ppm). The rainbow trout bioassays were conducted in 5 litre containers, with 4L test solution. The samples were performed in duplicate with 10 organisms per trial. The photoperiod was 16 hours o f light and 8 hours o f darkness. The temperature range was 12± 2°C. The fuel was stirred into the water before the rainbow trout were introduced into the chamber, chambers were then aerated. Mortality was recorded after 24,48, 72 and 96 hrs.

43

3.13.2 Supplier o f o , mykiss The a mykiss used in the first round o f tests were obtained from Linwood Acres Trout Farms Ltd. Campbellcroft, Ontario and were 6 weeks old and 151±2 mm in fork length. The rainbow trout were acclimated to test conditions (control water and temperature) for 14 days prior to test initiation. All trout fiy were vigorous and in good condition prior to testing. A second batch o f 30 day old rainbow trout hatchlings, at the alevin stage, was obtained from Blue Springs Trout Farm Ltd, Hanover, ON. All fish appeared healthy and in good physical condition.

3.13.4 Equipment and Test Chambers Separate holding and toxicity testing chambers were provided to prevent possible loss o f fish due to cross-contamination as well as to reduce the risk o f compromised test results. All material was thoroughly cleaned before use in the trials. Water temperatures for the holding tanks and test chambers were m aintained by a refrigerator. During holding and testing, rainbow trout fiys were shielded from external disturbances such as rapidly changing light conditions and pedestrian traffic (EPA, 2002).

3.13.5 Test Conditions The temperature o f test solutions was measured by placing a thermometer directly into the test solutions. Temperature was recorded continuously in at least one holding tank during the duration o f each test; temperature o f the water supply was also measured daily. Test solution temperatures were maintained within the limits specified for each test. Experimental temperature

44

was also measured by placing a thermometer outside the environmental chambers, environmental temperatures were also measured daily.

3.13.6 Number o f Test Organisms A minimum o f 20 fish were exposed to each concentration. Toxicity test involved five concentrations and a control; fish were used from common pool and distributed to the test chambers. A minimum o f two trials were performed for all concentrations; trials done in triplicate were noted.

3.13.7 Replicate Test Chambers Two test chambers were provided for each biodiesel concentration and the control. Although the data from duplicate chambers are usually combined to determine the LC50 and confidence interval values; replicate trials were performed for each fuel concentration. This was done because it; (i) permitted easier viewing and counting trout frys, (ii) avoided possible excess loading o f fish, which might occur if all of the test organisms are placed in a single test chamber and (iii) ensured against the invalidation or compromise of the test which m i ^ t result from accidental loss o f a test vessel, when all of the test organisms for a given treatment are in a single chamber (EPA, 2002).

,

The health o f the fiys was assessed by the performance o f rainbow trout (O. myMss) in holding tanks and control tests. Rainbow trout performance was measured by survival and growth data M ortality data was also recorded for fish in the holding tanks.

3.13.9 F ood Quality Food used in holding and testing fish was an important factor in toxicity testing; rainbow trout fish food was obtained from Linwood Acres Trout Farm Ltd.

3.13.10 H olding and H andling Test Organisms All fish were previously exposed to water o f the quality and the temperature used in the trials for at least fourteen days before they were used. Test organisms were not subjected to changes o f more than 3°C in water and environmental temperatures in any 12hr period, particularly when organisms were being transferred Ifom holding chambers to test chambers. Fish were handled as little as possible; when handling was necessary, it was done as gently, carefully and quickly as possible to m inim ize stress to the trout (EPA, 2002); dipnets were used to handle the swim-up fiys. Holding tanks for fish were supplied with DDI water; with the aid of a recirculation system, the control water flowed through an activated carbon filter to remove dissolved metabolites; crowding was also avoided. The dissolved oxygen (DO) content was maintained at a minimum o f 6.0 mg/1; the standard required for cold-water freshwater species (EPA, 2002). Fish were fed once a day with commercially prepared fish food (EPA, 2002). Excess food and fecal material was rem oved fi'om the bottom o f the tanks at least once every two days by siphoning. Holding

46

tank water was changed every two days. Each day rainbow trout fiys were observed for signs o f disease, stress, physical damage and mortality (EPA, 2002). Dead and abnormal specimens were removed as soon as observed. A daily record of feeding, behavioural observation and mortality was maintained.

3.13.11 Control Water & Holding Water DDI water was used both as the control and holding water. A given batch of holding water was not used for more than five days following preparation because o f the possible build-up of bacterial, fimgal or algal slime growth and the problems associated with it. The control water was aerated at least 24hrs prior to use in the toxicity tests and holding water was continuously aerated and filtered. DDI water was kept at temperature of 12± 2°C.

3.13.12 Mortality o f Holding Tank Following a 48-hour acclimation period, mortalities were recorded and the following criteria applied: (i) If after seven days, mortality is greater than 10 % of the total population, the entire batch was rejected. (ii) If after seven days, mortality is between 5 and 10% of the total population, the holding period is to be continued for seven additional days. Then, if no further mortalities occurred; the batch is acceptable; otherwise it must be rejected. (iii) If after seven days, mortality is less than 5 % of the total population, the batch was accepted (EPA,2002). , ,

47

The fish were exposed to water with the added test substances at a range o f concentrations for a period o f 96 hours. Mortalities were recorded at 24-hour intervals and the concentrations killing 50% o f the fish (LC50) at each observation time are calculated where possible. The mortality in the controls did not exceed 10% o f the entire population by the end o f the test (EPA, 2002).

3.14 M onitoring o f Bioassavs The static non-renewal tests were monitored at test initiation and termination for pH and hardness and every 24 hours thereafter for mortality. Temperature was monitored continuously throughout the test periods. A static non-renewal test was used; there was no raiew al o f test solution.

3.15 D ata Analysis The objective o f acute toxicity testing is to identify discharges o f toxins and chemicals in acutely toxic amounts. Results are derived from tests designed to determine the adverse effects o f toxins in aquatic waterways on the survival o f the test organisms. The toxicity test consists o f a control and five or more concentrations o f fuel; the endpoint o f these tests was mortality. The results o f the endpoint o f the multi-concentration test gives an estimate o f the fuel concentration which is lethal to 50% o f the test organisms in the time period prescribed; the value is expressed as the LC50 (EPA, 2002). M ortality rate can also be estimated by the mortality data obtained for each fuel tested. Control survival must be 90% or greater for an acceptable test, the test is acceptable if survival in the control equals or exceeds 90% (EPA, 2002).

4$

3.16 Acceptability o f Acute Toxicity Test Results

For the test results to be acceptable for both the daphnid {D. magna) and rainbow trout {Q. mykiss) experiments, the control survival must equal or exceed 90%. Tests are acceptable if temperature, DO content and other specified conditions fall within certain specifications. Any deviation from test specifications outlined in the procedure guidelines was noted when reporting data from test trials.

3.17 Statistical Analysis (7) Survival raw data in replicate exposure chambers was analyzed using a one-way analysis o f variance (ANOVA) statistical tool. This analysis determined whether replicates were significantly different from each other and the control. If a significant difference between replicates exists, the cause for the difference was determined (EPA, 2002), however if there was no significant difference, the trials were continued. If no significant difference was observed, replicates were pooled for further analyses. Mortality results obtained for each set o f organisms were then tabulated and analysed. (2) Concentration-mortality-time responses for all test substances were analysed for any

significant trends in mortality rate as a function of time and concentration. (3) The LC50 values for both D. magna and O. mykiss were determined by the Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method developed by Hamilton et al., 1977. (4) Mortality rates for diesel, BlOO, B50, B20 and B5 were compared to each other in order to develop a rank order o f toxicity among the five substances tested.

3.18 Concentration-Mortalitv-Time Relationship A concentration-mortality-time analysis was conducted to determine if there was any relationship between concentration and mortality and mortality and time among the five different fuels used in the toxicity tests.

3.19 LC50 Determination The num ber o f dead organisms per group was recorded against the time o f their death. The data obtained was used to calculate the median lethal concentration (LC50) of the fuel on D. magna juveniles and O. mykiss (rainbow trout) fiys (Dede and Kaglo, 2001). Mortality rates for diesel, BlOO, B50, B20 and B5 were compared to each other in order to develop a rank order o f toxicity among the five substances tested.

4. RESULTS DAPHNIA MAGNA

4.1 D. magna Observations Initially, it was the intention that Daphnia pulex be used in the range-finding and definitive tests, however, after the initial culturing phase, it was determined that these daphnids were too small to be observed for any signs o f mobility or mortality. It was very difficult to detect mobility or any other signs o f death from physical observations. Daphnia magna were then used in the acute toxicity experiments; they responded better than the D. pulex. However, it was just as difficult to get viable results; 100% mortality o f D. magna was observed at 60, 80 and lOOppm for diesel ftiel as well as for BlOO and B20, as indicated in Appendix B. Mortality was noted by the lack of daphnid movement, i.e., immobilization; similar observations were recorded for daphnids affected by diesel as well as those affected by neat biodiesel as well as the biodiesel blends.

Diesel There was a slight sheen o f fuel on the surface of the water and many daphnids were trapped as soon as they were placed in the test chamber (on average 6hrs), because o f this a pipette was used to insert daphnids beneath the water surface.

B100,B50,B20 and B5 Neat biodiesel and biodiesel blends also had similar observations to those conducted with diesel. A sheen was present on the water surface o f some samples and the daphnids experienced similar effects to those exposed to diesel. Mortality was noted by the lack o f swimming and the lack o f

51

physical movem ent by the daphmds. Some o f the mortality seen in the tests may have been caused by the physical nature o f the test substances.

4.2 D. magna Results Results o f Range-Finding Tests A range-finding test was done to determine a range o f concentrations to be administered for the definitive tests. A range o f 35ppm to lOOppm was performed in the initial testing stage. There was less than 100% mortality for organisms at 35ppm and more than 100% mortality at lOOppm, as noted in Appendix B.

Control Survival The controls m et the overall survival acceptability standards; more than 90% o f the control population were alive after the 24hr test period.

Significant Difference There was a difference in the survival means o f the experimental control groups when compared to the survival means firom the daphnids treated with diesel, BlOO, B50, B20 and B5. There was no significant difference between trials.

M ortality M ortality results are listed in Appendix B. Table 1 illustrates the average percent mortality o f four trials o f each concentration o f the five test substances (Diesel, BlOO, B50, B20 and B5). There is a general increase in mortality as concentration increases. The highest mortality was

52

recorded at the highest concentration tested, i.e. 50ppm, for all test substance. Sumlarly, the lowest mortality was recorded at the lowest concentration of 1.57ppm.

O.MYKISS

<; =

4.4 O. mvkiss Observations There are different stages in the life of the O. mykiss species; it was suggested in the Methods fo r Measuring the Acute Toxicity o f Effluents and Receiving Waters to F reshwater and Marine Organisms (EPA, 2002) that fish between 28 and 30 days be used in toxicity experiments. However, it was determined at this stage the trout are still feeding off their embryonic (yolk) sac; they are unable to eat and do not swim but remain at the bottom of the holding tank. These fish are at alevin life stage; they are very sensitive to light, water, movement and temperature. Consequently, it was difficult to determine if fish mortality was due to ambient experimental conditions or to actual acute effects of the fuels tested. In toxicity experiments, it was too difficult to use the 15-30 day old trout results since there is uncertainty in the cause of mortality. Instead, 6-week old trout ffys were used, at this stage the trout fry are able to feed off commercial fish food and are able to swim from the bottom of the holding tank to the surface. In the toxicity tests conducted with the different fuels, death or mortality was noted by lack of movement and breathing.

Diesel Before eventual death, fish swam erratically up and down the test chamber, there appeared to be irregular breathing; there was also irregularity in the movement of their gills. The trout fiy also developed slimy mucus on their body with an almost a `half-eaten' appearance; their fins and tails were tom and tattered. Another sign of death was the bulging eyes and discolouration o f the fish fi'om a brown to greyish black. Many rainbow trout were swimming on their sides, dead fish

61

were found at the bottom o f environmental chambers. Some fish experienced curling after being exposed to diesel concentration o f 600ppm and above.

B 1 0 0 ,B 5 0 ,B 2 0 a n d B 5 The trout fry showed very similar signs to the affects o f diesel and biodiesel blends. There was the irregularity in gill movement and haphazard swimming from the bottom o f the environmental test chamber to the surface. There was a consistent bulging o f the eyes which was followed by detachment fi'om the eye socket, at death, eyes appeared white. There was also fin erosion on fiys affected with the neat biodiesel and the biodiesel blends. However, fin erosion was more pronounced in fish exposed to B50 and B5, when compared to B 100 and B20. Some curling was also present for BlOO, B50, B20 and B5 for concentrations of 600ppm and above, dead fish were also found at the bottom o f environmental test chambers. I General Observations Surviving fish were in poor condition; barely breathing with slow and erratic swimming. There was an increase in fi-y movements; some fiy exhibited spiral swimming. Forced efforts to swallow air from the surface were also observed; the mouth and the gills o f dead fish were gaping, particularly after 72 and 96hrs. Many fiy had increased amounts of mucus secretion around the gills and on the body surface, as well as darkening of the fish body. For a short period o f time, m any fish were in a coma-like state prior to death; where there were no body motions except weak movements o f the gills. At death, the mouth was usually gaping and the gills were widely extended.

Range-finding tests were conducted on 4 and 6-week old O. mykiss fiys, range-finding tests are documented in Table 6 were conducted on 6-week old O. mykiss. A range-finding test was performed to determine a range of concentrations to use for the definitive tests. Three fuels were used; diesel, BlOO and B20. A test range of 2ppm to 90 ppm was first performed on these substances. There was less than 50% mortality recorded from 2.5ppm to 50ppm for diesel, BlOO and B20. A second range finding test was done, the concentrations tested were 100, 1000 and 2000ppm, as listed in Table 6. NOEC for diesel, BlOO and B20 were observed between 2.550ppm and between 2.5-50ppm for diesel. LOEC for BlOO and B20 was recorded at lOOppm and 90ppm was recorded for diesel.

Significant difference There was a difference in the survival means o f the experimental control groups when compared to the survival means from the daphnids treated with diesel, BlOO, B50, B20 and B5. However, there was no significant difference between trials.

Mortality Data M ortality results are listed in Appendix C. A concentration-mortality-time comparison was made for each test substance. Two trials were conducted for each concentration and the average o f these trials was used in the comparisons.

Figure 7 shows the average mortality (in percent) for O. mykiss exposed to different concentrations o f diesel across time. The data exhibit the typical concentration-response, with mortality increasing with increasing concentration o f toxin over the exposure period. The I average m ortality o f concentrations increased from 50.33% after 24 hr to 64.50% after 48 hr, to 80% at 72 hr and 85.33% at the end o f the 96-hour exposure.

Figure 12 shows the regression plots for the five test substances based on mean percent mortality values over 96hrs in function o f concentration. Trend analysis indicates that there is a small difference am ong the slopes o f the five fuels; there is a relatively proportional change in percent m ortality for every measured change in concentration for the different toxins.

Diesel has the largest mortality rate for all concentrations measured; BlOO has the lowest recorded mortality for all measured concentrations. B50 has a slightly higher mortality rate for 600 and 900ppm, when compared to B20.

Mortality Rates The mean mortality rates were calculated for the two replicates conducted for each concentration o f the different fuels over a period of 96hrs; these results are summarised in the Table 8. Diesel has the highest mortality rate of 70.17%, while neat biodiesel has the lowest mortality rate o f 42.5% over 96hrs.

Figure 13 illustrates the cumulative mortality rate of all five substances tested; neat biodiesel, BlOO, B20, B50 and B5. From the results obtained, diesel (70.17%) appears to be the most toxic, while BlOO seems to be less toxic as BlOO has the lowest recorded mortality rate (42.50%). B20 (44.75%) has a slightly lower mortality rate than B50 (51.75%); B5 has a mortality rate of 60.25%.

There is a consistent decrease in the LC50 for all the fuel types over the 96hr period. Table 15 shows the average LC50 over the four exposure periods. The average LC50 value for diesel and BSO are not true indications for a toxicity ranking as LCSO at 24hrs for BSO was not available since not deaths were greater than 50% of the population. Also, deaths at 96hrs for diesel exceeded 50%; the program used was not able to calculate a value for lethal concentration.

5. DISCUSSION
5.1 Experimental Parameters Temperature Temperature was a major controlling variable in the experiments conducted; O. mykiss (rainbow trout) were very sensitive to both water and environmental temperature changes. The optimal water tem perature range was between 8 and 12°C and the optimal environmental temperature range was betw een 8 and 15°C. Fish exposed to temperatures above or below this range died within a very short time period; as noted in the range-finding results. Like water temperature, environmental temperature was also an important controlling variable; the O. mykiss were very sensitive to the ambient environmental temperature; the water and ambient room temperature was maintained at the same temperature to prevent warming up of control and holding water and test chambers to temperatures above 15°C.
[

Water Besides temperature, another controlling variable was water type, in the control experiments, rainbow trout {O. mykiss) were placed in different types of water which included (i) distilled water, (ii) distilled deionised water (DDI) and (iii) tap water; one set o f samples was aerated while the other set was not aerated. The tap water was allowed to stand for approximately five days before use in parameter testing. Water samples were aerated for 24 hours before test initiation. The optimal water used for the definitive tests was aerated distilled deionised (DDI) water.

90

Bioassay Organisms

^

The initial organisms to be studied were Daphnia pulex {D. pulex) and 15-30 day O. mykiss, however, Daphnia pulex was too difficult to culture, catch and use as suitable test organisms because of their small size and it was also difficult to determine mortality with 15-30 day old trout fiys; as they were still attached and feeding off their embryonic sacs. Consequently, D. magna was used instead of D. pulex and 6-week old O. mykiss was used instead of trout at a younger life stage.

5.2 D. maena Esters, like methyl and ethyl esters are not soluble in water; these esters formed a sheen or film on the water surface, some D. magna were trapped in this film. Henceforth, D. magna were released below the water surface; significantly less D. magna were trapped in the sheen. The sheen was also present in some biodiesel blend trials and similar procedures were used to remediate the problem. The mortality rate was calculated over the 24hr exposure period; diesel has the highest mortality rate (78.34%), while BlOO has the lowest mortality rate o f 55.98%. Besides diesel, B50, B20 and B5 all contained some amount of diesel fuel in their mixtures prepared. However, of all the prepared mixtures B5 contains the largest amount o f diesel (by volume and percent), while B50 has the least amount by volume and percent; 50% biodiesel and 50% diesel. The 24hr-LC50 data was calculated using the Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method (Hamilton et al., 1977); diesel has the lowest LC50 of 1.78ppm, while BlOO has the highest LC50 value o f 4.65ppm. When the 24hr-LC50 values were compared, the acute aquatic toxicity o f BlOO was 2.6 times less toxic than diesel.

91

5.3 O. mykiss

.

For ail fiiels tested, m ortality increases with increasing concentration and increasing time. Diesel has the highest m ortality over time among all the five toxins tested. While BlOO has the lowest percent m ortality over time; in general the more diesel in the toxin, the higher the percent mortality; B5 has a higher percent mortality than either B50 or B20 over time.

LC50 data was calculated using the Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method; there is a general decrease in lethal concentration values for diesel, BlOO, B50, B20 and B5 over time. For all test substances, the lowest LC50 values were recorded at 96hrs, while the highest LC50 values were recorded at the 24hr period. The 24hr-LC50 value (578.13ppm) for diesel is the lowest LC50 value among all fuels tested, LC50 values for diesel were calculated for 24hr, 48hr and 72hr, however, no 96hr-LC50 was recorded; as more than 50% of the population were dead even at the lowest concentration. It can be inferred that this non calculable value indicates that diesel is the most toxic o f all five toxins. LC50 values for BlOO also decreased with increasing time, from 1073.54ppm to 455.28ppm. LC50 values for B20 also decreased with increasing time; B20 has the highest recorded LC50 value for all test substance (1074.3 Ippm at 24hrs).

It is also noted that B20 has the highest 96hr-LC50 o f 497.60ppm, of all of the toxins. Similar trends o f decreasing LC50 value with increasing time are observed for B50; however no 24hrLC50 value w as calculated as less than 50% of the test population showed no signs o f lethality at the end o f the 24hr period. There is also a decreasing LC50 trend for B5, the 96hr-LC50 value (129.57ppm) is also the lowest recorded lethal concentration value. BlOO has the highest average LC50 value (710.17 ± 136.38ppm) while diesel has the lowest average LC50 value (354.01±

92

128.36ppm); however, overall average LC50 values are not a true indication o f toxicity rankmg. The 24hr and 96hr-LC50 values for B50 and diesel respectively were not calculable. Since no deaths were greater than 50% of the population for B50 at the 24hr time period. All deaths were greater than 50% of the population for O. mykiss treated with diesel after 96hrs. Consequently, a fair comparison could not be made solely on calculated lethal concentration values.

5.4 B20 and B20 (Topia) Comparison

The effects o f B20 (Topia) were compared to those of B20; B20 (Topia) was commercially blended, while B20 was blended in the lab and the biodiesel feedstock used was composed of non-edible oils. There was a difference in the mortality rates and calculated LC50 values; B20 has a slightly higher mortality rate than B20 (Topia). B20 has a slightly lower LC50 values for all test periods than B20 (Topia), in comparison B20 is more toxic than B20 (Topia), However, there was not a substantial difference between B20 and B20 (Topia). In addition, difference in values may be a result of the difference in feedstock; the BlOO feedstocks may have some influence on the results obtained.

5.5 Toxicitv Ranking

5.5.1 Daphnia magna Diesel is more toxic than biodiesel and biodiesel blends, neat biodiesel (BlOO) is less toxic than biodiesel blends o f BlOO and conventional diesel. A toxicity ranking was done based on the

93

mortality rate, the larger the percent mortality the more toxic the fuel. Diesel was the most toxic (78.34%), followed closely by B5, B50, B20, while BlOO was the least toxic (55.98%).

A toxicity ranking was also done with the lethal concentration (LC50) values recorded, the lower the LC50 value the more toxic the substance. Diesel was the most toxic, followed closely by B5, B50 and B20; while BlOO was the least toxic. Diesel is the most toxic at 1.78ppm, while BlOO is the least toxic at 4.65ppm. Biodiesel blends with the larger amounts o f diesel, by volume and percent, showed lower LC50 values when compared to those with less diesel blended into the test mixtures. Among the blends, B5 had the lowest calculated LC50 value when compared with B50 and B20 respectively. As with the mortality rate, fuels with diesel were more lethal than those with no diesel additive, i.e., neat biodiesel (BlOO). The LC50 obtained for the D. magna static non-renewal tests were very close, the difference for the lowest value obtained (Diesel: 1.78ppm) and the highest value (BlOO; 4.65ppm) was 2.87ppm. The small difference maybe due to the small concentration values tested.

Toxicity ranking based on LC50 also determined diesel is the most toxic, followed closely by B5, B50, B20 and BlOO (the least toxic). In general, the more diesel in the mixture the more toxic the fuel, however B50 is ranked slightly higher than B20, in terms o f toxicity. This difference can be explained by the mortality rate between B50 and B20, for all test concentrations B50 has 10±3% more deaths than B20. This difference affects both percent mortality and lethal concentration. Nevertheless, it has been proven that diesel is more toxic than neat biodiesel, as well as biodiesel blends, in terms o f mortality rate and lethal concentration that kills 50% o f the population.

94

:

vu- .y;-;:

Similar results were obtained for experiments using O. mykiss'. diesel is more toxic than biodiesel and biodiesel blends. A toxicity ranking was done based on percent mortality; the larger the percent mortality the more toxic the fuel. Diesel (70.17%) was the most toxic, followed closely by B5, B50, B20, while BlOO (42.50%) was the least toxic for O. mykiss. The more diesel in the fuel mixture the more toxic the fuel; although B50 (51.75%) ranked slightly higher than B20 (44.75%). Diesel is more toxic than neat biodiesel or any other biodiesel blend, in terms of percent mortality.

A toxicity ranking was also done with the lethal concentration (LC50) values recorded, the smaller the LC50 value the more toxic the fuel. A high LC50 implies a lower toxicity because more o f the chemical is required to result in death. It was difficult to obtain a definite toxicity ranking using LC50 obtained from O. mykiss results. For 24hr-LC50, diesel was the most toxic; however, no value was obtained for B50 because more than 50% of the population survived. The 48hr-LC50 and 72hr-LC50 values produced the same toxicity ranking; Diesel>

B5>B50>B20>B100. B50 appears to be more toxic than B20, although it contains 30% less diesel. There is approximately 10± 5% more deaths of 0. mykiss treated with B50; particularly at concentrations of 600 and 900ppm. This difference affects the LC50 values and accounts for the higher than expected toxicity ranking. It was difficult to estimate an absolute toxieity ranking based on 96hr-LC50 values; the diesel 96hr-LC50 value was not calculable because all the concentrations exhibited more than 50% mortality; even at the lowest concentration of lOOppm. In addition, B50 had a non-calculable 24hr-LC50 value, where less than 50% o f the test population died. Nevertheless, an analysis of 96hr-LC50 values was done; diesel is the most

95

toxic (based on a non-calculable result), followed by B5, B50, BlOO and B20. B20 has a higher ranking (by a difference o f 42.32ppm) than BlOO, because slightly more fish treated with lOOppm, 600ppm and 1200ppm o f BlOO died when eompared to similar B20 concentration trials. However, it was proven that diesel is still more toxic than neat biodiesel or biodiesel blends.

5.5.3 B20 Toxicity Ranking A com parison o f D. magna results has determined that B20 (Topia) is less toxic than B20 and BlOO. According to percent mortality results, B20 (Topia) (54.81%) is slightly less lethal than BlOO (55.98%) as well as B20 (57.78%). LC50 results has determined than B20 (Topia) has a slightly higher 24hr-LC50 value (6.74ppm) than BlOO (4.65ppm) and B20 (4.54ppm), An

analysis o f O. mykiss results has also revealed that B20 (Topia) is less toxic than B20 and BlOO. According to percent mortality results, B20 (Topia) (37.75%) is slightly less lethal than BlOO (42.50%) as w ell as B20 (44.75%). B20 (Topia) is slightly less lethal than BlOO and B20, based on LC50 values. These differences can be explained by the number of deaths recorded for each fuel type. These results m ay also be attributed to different BlOO feedstocks; B20 (Topia) was produced from soy and canola oil, while BlOO and B20 were produced from waste cooking oils and fats.

6. CONCLUSIONS

Static non-renewal tests were conducted to determine the acute toxicity of biodiesel, biodiesel blends and diesel on freshwater ecosystems; the two main endpoints were mortality rate and lethal concentration which killed 50% of the test population. The two organisms used were D. magna and 0. mykiss; these organisms were used because of their sensitivity and availability. Neat biodiesel is referred to as BlOO, while biodiesel blends tested were B50, B20 and B5; these endpoints were compared to results obtained from conventional diesel fuel.

The toxicity tests showed that biodiesel is considerably less toxic than diesel fuel. However, like diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel blends still should be avoided in aquatic environments. Although biodiesel is less toxic than conventional diesel fuel, it can have a serious impact on aquatic organisms in the event of a large spill. Biodiesel and biodiesel blends should be handled like any other fuel to avoid contamination of watersheds. Biodiesel may have a less severe impact on freshwater organisms and the aquatic environment than petroleum diesel; however if accidentally spilled or inadvertently discharged during transportation storage or use, their impact may have similar toxic effects as those o f diesel spills.

Based on the results o f this study in its entirety, it can be concluded that biodiesel and biodiesel blends produced from non edible oils are less toxic than conventional diesel fuel. Biodiesel maybe a viable and environmentally-friendly alternative to diesel, in terms o f acute toxicity levels to freshwater organisms. However, it should be noted that this study is limited in scope; in that the statements concluded are based solely on acute toxicity o f diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel blends tested in this study. More specifically, biodiesel and biodiesel blends produced from a

97

non-edible oil feedstock. Other aspects o f biodiesel toxicity were not addressed by this study. These include acute toxicity o f biodiesel and biodiesel blends produced from edible oils, such as soybean and canola oils. W ith the exception of B20 (Topia), only specific non-edible biodiesel blends were tested, these were limited to B50, B20 and B5 and these blends were only mixed with conventional diesel fuel. This study only examined the effects of biodiesel and biodiesel blends over a short-term period; a study on chronic effects was not performed. Another limitation is concentration, since only a few concentrations were tested. It may be very difficult to predict or compare the extent o f biodiesel spills in `real world' situations, with limited blends and concentrations. In addition, natural processes may influence the extent and nature o f any particular biodiesel spill.

Future study should examine acute toxicity o f biodiesel produced from edible oils, such as vegetable oils. Long-term effects should also be considered, a comparison of chronic effects of biodiesel and biodiesel blends produced from edible and non-edible oils would also be a worthwhile study to perform.

It is difficult to definitely conclude that all neat biodiesel and all biodiesel blends are less toxic than all the different types o f diesel fuel. It is also difficult to compare the results obtained on this study to previous studies, since there is a lack of existing literature pertaining to acute toxicity o f biodiesel produced from non-edible oil sources on aquatic organisms.

It is also im portant to realise that the potential environmental impact of biodiesel spills will depend on other factors, such as (i) the location o f the spill, (ii) the volume o f the spill (iii) the

98

extent o f the spill, (iv) chemical components of biodiesel and (v) other prevailing environmental factors. It should also be noted that acute effects may be species-specific, in the bioassay performed, only D. magna and O. mykiss was used. Although these two species are significant bio-indicators for acute toxicity of organisms dwelling in the water column, no sediment dwelling organisms were used in the study; these organisms may be affected differently.

There are a number of improvements that could be made to this study in order to obtain greater acceptability of the results. Increasing the number of trials in both bioassays is recommended to improve the statistical validity of the results. Different concentrations could also be tested, as well as different biodiesel blends and chronic exposure may also increase confidence in the results, such as effects on D. magna offspring and future generations. Different bioassay organisms can also be used to increase the validity of the results. Acute toxic effects o f specific diesel and biodiesel components, as well as by-products of these toxins created by processes such as oxidation or biodégradation would offer valuable information on biodiesel toxicity.

Nevertheless, this study provides a comparison of acute toxicity o f neat biodiesel to different biodiesel blends; it also provides a comparison of acute toxicity of biodiesel to diesel. As the interest in biodiesel increases, this study can serve as a baseline for further biodiesel environmental impact studies.

Description of Statistical Tools
Dunnett Procedure The computer program obtained from the U.S. EPA. The program was designed for the analysis o f data from acute and short-term chronic toxicity tests with fish and other aquatic life, performed with effluents, receiving waters and reference toxieantS. The software: A. Performs an analysis o f variance (ANOVA), which is used to obtain the error value for Dunnett's Procedure.

B.

Performs a multiple eomparison of treatment means with the control mean (Dunnett's

Procedure). Dunnett's Procedure indicates whieh toxicant concentration means (if any) are statistically different from the control mean at the 5% level of significance.

C. Calculates the minimum difference between the control and treatment means that eould be detected as statistically significant, and test the validity of the homogeneity o f variance assumption using Bartlett's Test.

Trimmed Spearman Karber M ethod The program was designed for the analysis o f mortality data from acute and chronic toxicity tests with fish and other aquatic life, performed with effluents, receiving waters, and reference toxicants. D ata are input to the screen in an interactive mode. The program performs: A. Checks the observed response proportions to determine if they are monotonically non

decreasing (i.e., the response proportion for each higher concentration of test substance is greater than or equal to the response at the previous, lower, concentration.

B. Calculates the smoothed response proportions, if necessary.

C. Automatically determines the minimum percent "trim" necessary for calculating the LC/EC50.

D. Calculates the LC/EC50 and confidence limits.

E. Provides output to the screen and printer. Source: Hamilton, M.A., Russo, R. C., and R.V. Thurston. 1977.
