Abstract
EFFECT OF A SLAT ARM DOOR ON THE W ING EFFICIENCY OF A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT
Sharm an P erera , M A Sc.

Departm ent o f M echanical Engineering Ryerson University Toronto, Ontario, Canada Y e a r 2004

The objective o f this thesis is to determine the influence o f a slat arm door on the aerodynamic performance of a wing o f a commercial aircraft during it's take off and landing configurations using CED simulation. The slats are extended forward by extendable arms coming out fi'om the leading edge of the wing through the openings. A door covers the top part o f the opening o f the leading edge of the wing after the slat arm is deployed. CFD analysis o f wing and slat configuration o f the aircraft showed that the removal of this slat door at higher angle o f attacks increased the drag by 0.88%, reduced the lift by 1.29%, increased the inert particle residence time inside the slat door compartment by 200.00% and increased the local flow separation area on the top surface o f the wing by 42.81% with reference to the closed model.

1.1 Background
The Aurora was introduced to the commercial aircraft market in October 2001. This twinjet was designed specifically to serve the emerging regional market. This short-haul, high frequency market demands ftdl-size jetliner comfort, low noise and emissions, low operating costs and high schedule reliability. At 100 seats, the Aurora fits this new market perfectly. The Aurora meets tlie worldwide need for efficient short-hop service, short-field operations, fast turnaround at airport gates and the ability to sustain 8 to 12 one-hour flights every day. The Aurora Inc. strengthens the product line with a smaller, lighter model optimized for the emerging regional market, ft is estimated that the market will require 3,000 aircraft worldwide over the next 20 years [1]. Aurora Inc. is constantly on the lookout for ways to cut down the manufacturing and maintenance cost o f these aircraft and to increase their efficiency. The merger between Mazenda Inc. with Aurora Inc. in 2003 increased efficiency by filling gaps at both companies while at the same time eliminating duplication and redundancies [2]. As a result o f the merger, construction and manufacturing costs o f all aircraft were revised for improvements in efficiency. One o f the components brought into question was the slat door o f the Aurora wing. Slat doors in Aurora are used to cover partially the openings that are cut into the leading edge of

the wing once slats are deployed during take-off and landing. Other commercial aircraft produced by Aurora do not include slat doors on their wings. It is important to find the effectiveness of these slat doors on the Aurora since a significant portion of its operational life is spent in the take off and landing configurations. The Aurora spends an average o f 17 minutes during take-off from sea level to basic ceiling and 29 minutes during landing from basic ceiling to sea level [3]. According to Master Pilot R. Chaffin's flight logbook, the Aurora spends an average o f 50% o f it's flight time during take off and landing for a flight which takes 1.5 hrs to fly from the Caribbean Islands to Central America [4].

1.2 Use of high lift devices on the Aurora aircraft
Take-off and landing distances o f all aircraft are strongly influenced by their stall speeds. Lower stall speeds require lower accelerations or decelerations and correspondingly shorter field lengths. Increasing the wing area for the duration o f take-off and landing can reduce stall speed. This wing area is increased by deploying slats and the flaps using mechanical actuators located at the fixed leading and fixed trailing edges o f the wing respectively. Figure 1.2.1 shows cross sections o f an Aurora wing at cruise, take-off and landing configurations. The high lift devices such as the slat and the flap of Aurora are used to increase the lift: during take off and the drag during landing and to enhance the boundary layer stability. The slat is located at the fixed leading edge o f the wing and the flap is located at the fixed trailing edge ofthe main wing.

[5].

The slat has only two positions, fully extended during both take off and landing and fully retracted during cruise. However, the location and the orientation o f the flap will vary depending on the landing and take-off configurations. The maximum flap deflection at landing is 40°, while at take-off it is 20° .

The leading edge o f the slat is heated froni the anti-icing bleed air running through a tube located inside the slat. The connection between this tube inside the slat and the fixed wing is provided through the telescopic duct located in-between slat arm number 1 and 2. Aurora uses 5

cable-operated sets o f tracks to deploy and retract the slats. Figure 1.2.3 shows one o f the track sets and the connection o f the cables to the slat arm. The spring-loaded slat door is located just above the slat arm and is shown in dark red. As the slat arm is pulled out using cables, the spring loaded slat door is opened and locked at the door-closed position until the slat arm is pulled back in again. The lobe shape end o f the slat arm near the slat pushes the spring loaded slat door as the slat is retracted into cruise configuration. The intent o f this door is to close the slat arm cavity when the slats are deployed.

1.3 High lift devices aerodynmics
High lift devices increase performance by effectively increasing airfoil camber increasing wing's wetted surface area. The lift acts perpendicular to the direction o f the free stream velocity while drag acts in the direction o f the flow. The figure 1.3.1 shows the reference value of the chord, angle o f attack and directions o f the Drag and the Lift forces with respect to the free stream velocity that will be used in this report for fiirther analysis.

Normally both the flap and slat are extended during take-off and landing phases, but the deployment o f the flap is not included in the CFD model o f the wing to isolate effects of slat/slat arm door.

1.3.1 Flap aerodynamics
One o f the most time consuming parts o f CFD modeling is the mesh generation. One must know the aerodynamic phenomenon around the wing and high lift devices in order to generate an appropriate mesh. A finer mesh is required especially in the areas closer to the wing, in regions

suspected to have viscous phenomenon such as boundary layer development and separation, wakes, and any interactions o f such phenomena. The CFD results found in this thesis will not include the effects of flaps but understanding the aerodynamics behind flaps will provide the reader with an overall appreciation of high lift devices if they were introduced in the CFD model. Flap in the Aurora aircraft is located in the wake o f the slat arm door and there will not be any significant effect on the slat arm door if flaps were introduced. Flaps are located at the fixed trailing edge o f the wing. They are deployed during take o ff to increase the lift and drag during landing. This is done by effectively increasing the airfoil camber. The shape o f the airfoil camber also changes simply by changing flap angle. The Aurora uses an average flap angle of 20° during take-off and 40° during landing. Figure 1.3.2 shows how flaps can change the lift coefiBcient (Cl) as angle o f attack of the aircraft increases from 0° to 25".

Figure 1.3.2 shows that flaps increase ihe lift at a given angle o f attack. The C l v s . angle o f attack plot for the DC-9-30 aircraft will have similar trends as the Aurora aircraft since both the Aurora and DC-9-30 aircrafts have similar flap configurations.

1.3.2 Slat aerodynamics
The effect o f slats on the total lift o f the aircraft is comparatively small compared to the contribution of lift due to flaps. However, slats play a major role in wing aerodynamics by extending the range o f attack angles over which the flow over an airfoil remains attached. Slats reduce the pressure peak near the nose by changing the nose camber o f an airfoil. The flow close to the lower surface o f the airfoil creeps through the opening between the slat and the fixed leading edge and re-energizes the boundary layer on the main airfoil. The new boundary layer formed at the fixed leading edge o f the airfoil effectively delaying the flow separation on the upper surface of the airfoil, eliminating the detrimental effect o f the initial adverse pressure gradient that would otherwise initiate flow separation, especially at higher angle o f attacks.

1.4 Boundary layer phenomena
A flowing fluid can be classified as either laminar or turbulent. Laminar flow moves in non mixing laminas while turbulent flow is the exact opposite; laminas break up and move in an irregular and random pattern. Characteristics o f these two types o f flows depend on the history o f the flow and the strengtli of the fluid viscosity. Usually, flow over a shape starts out laminar and becomes turbulent a short distance downstream. This transformation region from laminar to turbulent flow is called the transition region and is found on the external surface o f most commercial aircraft.

Figure 1.4.1 shows the boundary layer over a flat plate. This figure also shows the laminar layer as it becomes turbulent and how the boundary layer grows towards the rear o f the plate. At some point the flow actually separates from the body surface. Downstream o f this separation point, reverse flow will be found along the surface with the static pressure nearly constant and equal to that at the point o f separation. The boundary layer development described can vary depending on the size, shape and the surface finish o f the wall surface, the magnitude o f the free-stream velocity, and the properties of the fluid. Variation in these parameters can change the position at which transition or separation occurs. Unlike the flat plate, the Aurora wing has thickness and camber but will nevertheless experience a boundary layer development similar to a flat plate.

1,4.1 Laminar sub layer
The viscous effects on the fluid adjacent to the wall surfaces are dominant and turbulence is almost completely absent in this region. The temperature and velocity in this region can be found using a linear relationship. This behavior o f the fluid close to the wall surfaces is very important when modeling boundary layers using CFD packages since most o f the turbulence models require a sufficient number o f nodes in the laminar sub layer to allow accurate modeling o f the log-law behavior throughout the layer. Figure 1.4.2 shows the velocity profile o f a turbulent boundary layer close to a flat plate. The region with a linear velocity profile is defined as the laminar sub layer. The heat transfer in the laminar sub layer is governed by conduction only. The shear stress on the wall can be found by simply dividing the velocity at the end o f the laminar sub layer by it's thickness and then

multiplying the result by the fluid's viscosity. A laminar sub-layer will be present in the flow over an Aurora wing.

1.4.2 Boundary layer interaction and creation of vortices
Interaction between boundary layers and bluff bodies are very important since most external aircraft components can be considered as bluff bodies with flow around them affected by the neighboring parts or by their supports. Aircraft wake vortex formation during approach plays a major role in deciding the separation distances between aircraft. Reducing the separation distance between aircraft during approach will increase the number o f sorties avoiding costly delays in busy airports [6] [7]. These vortexes are mainly created by the wing tip horseshoe vortices but recent studies using CFD shows the presence o f vortices due to the flow traveling upward through the small gap between the slats, especially at higher angles o f attack [8]. Studies conducted by Lee and Klewicki examined the flow around a circular cylinder embedded in a single boundary layer, shear-wake and combination of boundary layer and shearwake [6], The results found using smoke injection visualization and the velocity calculations using a hot wire probe, showed that there are vortices present in all three cases.

The results confirm that vortices are present not only when the boundary layer is separated due to the adverse pressure gradient above a wall surface but also when the boundary layer and bluff body interact, and when interaction between shear layer and bluff body and the interaction of inflection boundary layer and bluff body create vortices with the specific orientation as shown in figure 1.4.3.

All these flow scenarios shown in figure 1.4.3 are present in flow around slat arm at high lift configuration. The separation o f a boundary layer is present on the upper surface of the main airfoil at higher angles of attack. The boundary layer that forms over the slat sees the fixed leading edge of the wing as a buff body. The shear wake emanating from the fixed trailing edge o f the wing and the flaps are similar to the shear layer and cylinder interaction. The wake o f the upper

edge of the slat has an inflectional profile, which interacts with the fixed leading edge o f the wing similar to interaction o f the inflectional profile/ cylinder in figure 1.4.3. The Aurora model needs to have a fine mesh around the areas where boundary layers interact with bluff bodies to capture all o f these 3 situations.

1.4.3 Angle of attack and boundary layer separation
Figure 1.4.4 shows the separation of a boundary layer on an aircraft wing as angle o f attack increases. The separation point moves slowly forward as angle o f attack increases firom 0° to 15° and remains relatively close to the trailing edge o f the airfoil. At 15° this airfoil creates maximum lift, beyond this angle of attack the boundary layer separation point jumps forward, reducing the lift and increasing the pressure drag. The angle that corresponds to maximum lift is called the stall angle the critical angle. The turbulent wake increases in size slowly as the angle of attack increases firom 0 to 15° and beyond the critical angle it increases rapidly covering the entire upper surface o f the airfoil.

The main wing of the Aurora also has the same performance characteristics of the 2D airfoil but the 3D nature o f the real wing will afi>ct the effective angel o f attack due to it's inherited twist and tapered ratio. The mesh o f the Aurora wing needs to have a finer mesh throughout the whole upper surface of the wing and significant off wall spacing in the boundary layer to capture the boundary layer separation [9].

1.5 Reynolds number effect
A commonly held view in aerodynamics is that an increase of Reynolds number will increase the aerodynamics properties of an airplane such as Cl, Cd and etc. [10]. Wind tunnel testing of the DC-10 aircraft done in low Reynolds number to simulate the cruising conditions by Lynch of Douglas showed that this view does not hold all the time [11]. In-flight condition Reynolds number tends to be higher than a wind tunnel test resulting a thicker boundary layer. Figure 1.5.1 shows the progressive work done by McMasters and Mack on several Aurora 700 series aircraft from 1950 to present. It shows how Ctmax in wind tunnel and in-flight testing changes at different Reynolds numbers.

num ber increases and reduces as the Reynolds num ber further increases beyond a certain value.

This surprising behavior in Ctmax was initially explained by Woodward, et al. [13]. According to their results at low Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer is initially laminar, and then transitions in a classical two-dimensional sense. At higher Reynolds numbers the flow on the attachment line

is initially turbulent, and this results in a thicker boundary layer that tends to separate more rapidly, leading to lower values of maximum lift [14].

1.6 Aircraft corrosion due to contaminants around the airports
The annual (1996) corrosion cost to the U.S. aircraft industry is estimated at US $ 2.225 billion, which includes the cost of design and manufacturing at US $ 0.225 billion, corrosion maintenance at US $ 1.7 billion and downtime due to corrosion at US $ 0.3 billion [15].These figures show how important is to take measurements during manufacturing process to reduce the corrosion in aircraft parts that can occur during an average life span of an aircraft. The acidity of the environment around airports can significantly affect the corrosion behavior of most aluminum alloys use in aircraft. A survey conducted by Baboina R. [16] showed that the corrosion in new vehicles parked in airport parking lots experienced localized corrosion, such as crevice corrosion, after a short time on the lot. This corrosion compared to the type of corrosion given by vehicles driven in the city. He concluded that the exhaust emissions from the aircraft jet engines attributed to localized corrosion, which is similar to that observed down-wind and close to volcanic activity. An unfortunate accident that occurred in the past with Aurora 700 series aircraft shows how important it is to take necessary measurements to reduce corrosion in their jet line series. In October 1992, an EL AL 747 freighter crashed in Amsterdam, killing all four people on board and over 50 people on ground. This accident occurred because o f a broken fuse pin that was designed to break when an engine seized in flight, and resulted in the engine separating during landing. A possible reason for breakage o f the fuse pin is corrosion pits and fatigue. These corrosion pits usually form via a lack of passivity, surface discontinuities, or insufficient inhibitor coverage [16]

[17].

Corrosion was also found in the bonded area o f the skin plates of CP-140 Aurora aircraft. According to Capt Giguère, S. [18] cause of this corrosion was believed to be water in the grease from a global positioning system (GPS) antenna. He believed that water penetrated through cracks in the seal surrounding the GPS antenna resulted in crevice corrosion damaging-two portions of the CP-140 structure. These unfortunate incidents in the past show how important it is to find how well the slat doors can prevent the penetration of contaminants that can initiate the corrosion of parts inside the wing through the opening located at the fixed leading edge of the wing. It is also important to see how long these contaminant agents will reside inside the slat door cavity of the Aurora aircraft since the presence o f the slat door will affect the residence time. Less residence time will give less chance of residual material left behind.

1.7 General approach to the problem

1.7.1 P r e v io u s stu d ie s

A wind tunnel testing of the Aurora wing and slat arm configuration was done by Craig [19] at Ryerson University to find whether the removal o f the slat arm doors on the fixed leading edge of Aurora wing caused significant change to the aerodynamic characteristics o f the wing. Figure 1.7.1 shows a picture o f Craig's' scaled down model. The model was built using balsa wood without the inherited tapered-ratio, sweep angle and the dihedral angle o f the Aurora wing.

Figure 1.7.1: Balsa wood model o f Aurora wing and slat configuration built by Andrew Craig. [19]

The results found by Craig showed no appreciable change in lift or drag. He concluded that this was due to the problems involved in scaling tlie model with the wind tunnel. He recommended that a larger more sophisticated wind tunnel with more adaptable mountings to balance the slat and wing set-up would have given better results, allowing investigation of sweep angle, tapered-ratio and the dihedral angle on the scaled model [19]. The wind tunnel model in figure 1.7.1 also showed that the size o f the slat arm door was small in comparison to the overall wing, and this would be difficult to get quantitative results using wind tunnel testing. Not many aircraft have slats arm doors in their wings. The slat-arm doors in Aurora are unique and few studies have been done. Previous CFD studies done by Perera, S. with Aurora wing and slat configuration showed that there was a significant elTect on wing lift and drag due to the slat arm doors. These results were found using a simplified inviscid CFD model [20].

1.8 Thesis objectives

The efficiency o f the slat door can be determined through the following objectives: 1. Investigate the effect o f the slat door on the wing lift and drag for different angles o f attack. 2. Investigate the effect o f the slat door on the wing's stall angle as measured by boundary layer separation. 3.

2.1 Why CFD
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool, which combines fluid mechanics theory, applied mathematics and state o f the art computer power [21]. This tool can be used in the design o f aircraft and to find the aerodynamic effects o f existing components in order to reduce the time and the cost for manufacturing, operation and maintenance.
This CFD technology emerged in the late 1960 and started expanding into the aerodynamics community as the speed and the memory o f computer power increased. The aerospace community has successfiilly used CFD in the design and development o f aircraft for a several years now. According to M avriplis [22], CFD is now a principle aerodynamic technology along with wind tunnel testing and flight-testing.

CFD can also be used to find the residence time and the trajectories o f particles in and around aircraft and crevices like the slat aim door compartment in Aurora aircraft Winters W.S. and Cheniweth [23] used CFD to model the dispersion o f biological agents into a 3D living space. The results showed that particle trajectories and flight time are influenced by several factors and it would be difficult to anticipate using "common sense" or lower fidelity models.

2.2 Use of CFD in aerospace industry to model high lift systems
Calculating the viscous flow over a high-lift system o f a commercial aircraft is difficult because o f flow phenomena such as boundary layer separation, shock-boundary layer-interaction and multiple elements merging o f confluent wakes [24]. Despite the difficulties in modeling high lift systems using CFD, significant work has been done to simulate 3D higli lift flow fields using full Navier-Stokes solutions. Studies done by the Aurora Company, Long Beach and NASA Ames research center successfully used the OVERFLOW code, which uses Reynolds Average Navier Stokes method ( RANS) to find the efficiency o f externally blown flaps and the effect o f nacelle strakes around the engines and to see how nacelle strakes affect the wake vortices [25]. The CFD code OVERFLOW predicted excellent results up to the maximum lift coefficient. This code also captures successftdly the vortices generated by nacelle strakes and predicted how strakes improved the health o f the boundary layer on the wing upper surface by the counter rotating and down washing vortices created by the inboard slat-edge.

2.3 Advantages o f using CFD methods over wind tunnel testing
Wind tunnel testing used to be the only method o f testing aerodynamics m odels in the past. According to M arvipilis F. m ost wind tunnel testing is done at the wrong Reynolds numbers [8] due to the restrictions o f wind tunnels such as wind tunnel operating speed, size o f the test section and difficulties in reducing wind tunnel w all and support structures effects. U se o f a wrong Reynolds number in wind tunnel testing w ill yield inaccurate prediction o f flow phenomenon such

The most accurate results are achieved only by in flight-testing. These types o f testing are very expensive and a few companies in the world can afford to perform them. Because o f increasing computer power and speed, CFD methods are becoming very popular and economical ways to test aerodynamic models. The cost o f wind tunnel testing is expensive compared to the CFD testing, but-cheaper than obtaining the massive amounts of data needed for detail design [26]. According to Karpynczyk, J. [27]. one has to spend an average o f Can $ 84-140K to build a wind tunnel with 4 feet by 4 feet test section, compared to the price o f a commercial CFD software package, which would cost around Can $ 30-50 K for a duration o f one year [28]. There is no cost involved to maintain an in-house CFD code for a company other than the initial cost involved in purchasing the code, unlike the wind tunnel which is relatively expensive to set-up, operate and to maintain. The operating velocity range and the data acquisition time during wind turmel tests are limited. Some supersonic wind tunnels can operate for only for few seconds, and all the necessary results must be captured during this limited time. In CFD methods, the user can select any type o f initial condition to match the physical situations that are available within the software, or the user can write his/her own subroutine to introduce necessary initial conditions. The CFD user can capture the results at his/her convenience since the results can be generated at any time once solutions are converged. The latest wind tunnel calibration techniques and boundary layer control systems yield better results today than one could achieve in the past. Boundary layer control methods in wind tunnel testing such as boundary layer suction can reduce the thickness o f the boundary layers during wing tunnel testing, simulating the in-flight flow even at lower Reynolds numbers [29]. But the interferences due to wind tunnel walls and support mountiags are still unavoidable.

2.3.1 CFD modeling of a wind tunnel
CFD was successfully used in the past to model both in-flight and wind tunnel experiment settings. NASA Ames created CFD models of a wing placed inside a wind tunnel to include the wind tunnel walls and boundary layer control suction holes to simulate a wing placed inside a wind tunnel and a wing at in-flight condition. The results found in these two CFD simulations were compared with experimental results. Comparative studies of all four cases showed that results achieved for CFD simulation o f free air always over predicted the C l compared to the wind tunnel CFD model. The Cimax o f the CFD simulations for both the wind tunnel and the free air models always under predicted the corresponding experimental values by about 3% [26]. These results confirmed that CFD methods can give reasonably good results and this, is a valid method to predict the flow phenomenon around external aerodynamic components. Similar studies were done by the author using FLUENT to simulate a wing with the same Aurora aircraft airfoil placed inside a wind tunnel using wing support mounting and a wing placed in free air as shown in figure 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 respectively. Wall boundary conditions were used on the upper and the lower surfaces of the Wind Tunnel model while the left and the right side with respect to the inlet were modeled using a symmetry boundary condition to isolate the effect of the upper and the lower wall surfaces of the wind tunnel on the scaled-down model. The wind tunnel shaped model has a cross section o f 1x1 m^ and a length o f 10m. The model used in the wind tunnel is scaled down by a factor o f 5, and has a wing chord o f 0.5 m. This model is placed at the middle o f the wind tunnel as shown in figure 2.3.1.

Figures 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 show pressure contours o f the models placed inside a wind tunnel and free air respectively. These computational models were built using GAMBIT and solved using FLUENT. The main purpose o f this comparison is to find the effect o f the wind tunnel and the support on the wing performance and to compare the values of Cl and Cp of these two models. Figure 2.3.2 clearly shows the effect o f the wall and the wing supports on the Wind Tunnel model on pressure contours compared to the Free Air model. In the free air model, contours are not disturbed since the far field boundary is placed 20 chords away from the wing compared to the wind tunnel model, where it is a place only 5 chords away from the wing. The free air has Cl o f 1.53 and Cd o f 0.03 compared to the Cl o f 1.43 and Cd of 0.06 of the wind tunnel model. These two values shows that the there are significant effects on the wind tunnel walls and the supporting mountings of the wind tunnel model on both C l and Cd. The wind tunnel model under predicts C l by 6.50% and over predicts C d by 84.30% when compared to the free air model since wind tunnel models in CFD are not practical, due to the need for correction confirming free stream configurations in CFD are clearly the preferred method.

2.4 Validation of CFD codes
There are a lot o f CFD codes available for use. Validations o f these codes are very important with milestone problems in CFD before applying them to for real life problems. Most o f the CFD code writers validate their CFD codes with standard problems such as external flow around cylinders and flat plates. But validation o f a CFD code with known problems o f aircraft design provides valuable information about its features and limitations in solving problems for the aerospace industry.

A competition held by the CFD Society o f Canada in 1996, using a two-dimensional multi element high lift airfoil had allowed many aerospace companies and institutions in CFD to compare and validate their in-house codes against the other CFD codes in the aeroqjace industry. An experimental test Case A-2 in the AGARD Advisor Report No 303 with Multiple Element Airfoil was used as the test model. The results found using in-house codes o f Aurora, NASA Ames and NASA Langley and U of T were compared against the experimental data provided by the AGARD, which were presented at the Fourth Annual Conference o f the CFD Society of Canada. Comparative studies o f these codes revealed that incompressible Navier-Stokes codes produced better results at lower angles o f attack compared to the com pressible Navier-Stokes codes. It was also found that compressible Navier-Stokes codes produced better results compared to the incompressible Navier-Stokes codes at higher angles o f attack but compressible codes were almost an order o f magnitude slower than the incompressible codes [30] [32].

2.5 Testing the capabilities and limitations of FLUENT

A 2D model of the Multiple-Element Airfoil was generated using the vertices given by the Case A-2 of the AGARD Advisory report No 303 [30]. A rectilinear surface mesh was created using the GAMBIT TM grid generation software placing more nodes close to the wall surfaces of the airfoil and fewer nodes in the far field boundary. A structured mesh was generated making sure there were enough nodes close to the wall surfaces to model the boundary layer. Tire figure 2.5.2 compares the coefficient of pressure versus percent chord distance from the leading edge of the slat of the Multi-Element airfoil foimd using FLUENT with published experimental results imder the same boundary conditions, Mach number of 0.197 (free stream), Reynolds Number 14.9 million (based on the chord) and the angle of attack o f 4.01°.

These two graphs have exactly the same trends as the actual Cp vs. percent chord presented in the conference. The Cp at the suction peak for both Experimental and CFD analysis using FLUENT were found at x/c =0.18 location with same values of Cp--4.00. The results found using FLUENT also showed the presence of local flow separation and mixing of wakes and boundary layers from the airfoil elements. These flow phenomenon, are considered to be difficult to model practitioners of CFD in aerodynamics. These results show that FLUENTTM provided excellent results for the test case and would be an ideal candidate for the Aurora wing and slat arm configuration problem.

The shape and features o f the Slat-Arm; Slat-Door and the section o f Aurora wing are all represented in the numerical model. Figure 3.1 shows a section o f Aurora wing made available to the researcher. The figure shows both retracted and extended positions of the slat. The slat-Arm of this model is built using a "I" shape beam, which has a radius of curvature of 4 ft (0.902 Chord). The slat is deployed and retracted using pulleys and cable system located at the front section of the main wing. This is enclosed in a small compartment (Slat Box), which extends 15 inches (0.113 C) into the main wing from the fixed end wing tip.

The section of the Aurora wing was given to the author as a detailed CAD drawing in the form o f an IGES file. The drawing consisted of both the retracted and extended positions o f the slat even though the computational model will simulate only the extended position. The retracted drawing o f the slat arm was removed from the main model once it was imported to the mesh generation software making sure that all the necessary details were captured in order to generate the best computational model possible. There are very good mesh generation software packages available today such as GRIDGEN, ICEMCFD and GAMBIT. GAMBIT is the preprocessor for FLUENT and it allows the user to construct and mesh models through a graphical interface (GUI). The process use to create the computational domain in GAMBIT is similar to many other Mesh generation software in the market. The steps followed to create the computational domain of the model can be summarized as follows. 1. Importing o f geometry and mesh information (IGES file) 2. Creation o f geometry 3. Creation and refinement o f the mesh 4. Assignment o f zone types and exportmg the model as a mesh file.

3.1 Import of geometry and mesh information
GAMBIT imports models done in ACIS, Farasolid, IGES, STEP and CAD files [32]. The model given to the author from Aurora was in IGES format and the length units were in inches. This model was imported into GAMBIT with 1 to 1 scale using the spatial option in GAMBIT without virtual cleanup. This spatial option specifies the generic translator to produce only real volumes compared to the native option, which can produce either real or virtual geometries.

GAMBIT uses the ACIS modeling techniques when creating or manipulating volumes. This modeling technique requires a high degree o f tolerance and accuracy in data, which describe dre volumes and their connectivity. The volumes, which satisfy the ASCI tolerances, are defined as real volumes and the others as virtual volumes. It is convenient to merge real volumes and mesh them compared to the virtual volumes especially when one has to modify the provided geometry. The virtual clean up technique in GAMBIT allows the author to clean up some of the geometry by connecting disconnected vertices and edges and merging very short edges with longer adjacent edges in order to facilitate the meshing. The model o f Aurora wing and slat section given to the researcher by Aurora Ltd. has entities that were poorly connected and unnecessary vertices, edges and faces that were not required in generating a 3D model. These unnecessary geometric entities can be automatically deleted during importing process to reduce the time and the fiustration o f deleting them after they were imported into the mesh generation software. The GLOBAL tolerance value in GAMBIT is 10'^ with the possible range o f the model from 10'^ to 10" *units [32]. The wing chord o f the model provided by Aurora is approximately 10ft with the smallest length for this project, the spacing between the Slat-Arm and the frame o f the opening at the leading edge o f the wing is at approximately 0.01 inches. The biggest and the smallest dimensions are well within the range o f GAMBIT geometric tolerances otherwise user will need to change the default tolerance values before importing the model into GAMBIT.

3.2 Creation of geometry
Aurora has a rectangular wing, which spans 93 feet and 4 inches. Figure A1 in the appendix shows the general dimensions o f Aurora aircraft. Only a section o f Aurora wing was given to the author due to proprietary reasons. This section o f the initial model is shown in figure 3.2.1 in solid

The given section o f the Aurora wing and slat configuration by Aurora Ltd. was later extruded by five times o f the original width (22 inches X 5) towards the tip and the root of the main wing since the original model was only 22 inches width which is small when compared to the mean wing chord o f the given section. The extrusion o f the wing also allowed the researcher to introduce symmetry boundary conditions on the tip and the root ends o f the extruded sections and to place the far field boundary conditions far from the wing, where the since free stream conditions are imposed. Figure 3.2.2 shows the extruded model o f Aurora wing and slat configuration.

The extruded model has all the geometrical features affecting the wing aerodynamics performance. This section is tapered, twisted and has the same dihedral and swept back angles as the wing of Aurora aircraft with respect to the fuselage. Figure 3.2.3 shows a close up of the regenerated model. It does not have the nuts, bolts and cutouts on the Slat-Arm. Effect of these items in the aerodynamics performance of the wing will be negligible since they are in the shadow of the Slat and are too small relative to the size o f the slat arm door. Figures.2.3 shows the extended Slat arm and the door (Slat-Door) that partially covers the opening at the leading edge o f the main wing. The Slat is attached to the Slat-Arm using the flange located at the end o f the slat arm. The slat was intentionally erased from this figure to visualize the details around the Slat -- Arm and Slat-Door region since it is in the shadow o f the Slat.

3.3 Modeling o f the flow domain

The flow domain of the mesh consists of the space surrounding the wing, which is discritized into a mesh o f non-overlapping control volumes. Selection of the correct shape for the outer boundary o f the numerical domain will reduce both the time and the memory consumption in creating the numerical model. The numerical model should also allow the user to change the direction of the flow simply by changing the unit vectors o f the incident flow direction at the far field boundary rather than recreating the whole model. The model should also be able to capture the important flow phenomenon such as flow separation, the wake behind the wing and the other flow properties like pressure, turbulence intensity and pressure distribution in the flow domain. These properties can extent to considerable

distances from the wall surfaces o f the wing. Pressure Far Field Boundary (PFFB) conditions are commonly used to simulate the free stream velocity for external flow domain problems such as the one in this project. These boundary types should be placed at least 20-chords away form the wall surfaces o f the wing to impose free stream conditions without interference on the wing [32]. Figure 3.3.1 shows how the wing is placed in the flow domain with respect to the far field boundary.

The size o f the slat arm door compared to the wing main chord is comparatively small, thus one must introduce a very fine mesh around the slat arm door to visualize the flow around it. Unfortunately t is impractical to cover the whole flow domain with this very fine mesh. A 36

uniformly fine mesh all the way to the far field domain located at 20 chord lengths will he cumbersome since the mesh will have billions o f nodes as a result. It is a challenge to generate a grid that can be accommodated by the available computational resources and yet model all of the desired flow features. Selection of an appropriate grid type needs some experience in grid generation. Questions owing to the selection of an appropriate mesh for the Aurora wing and slat configuration can be categorized as follows.

> >

Whether to reduce the size o f computational domain and how much? Whether to select structured mesh, unstructured mesh or hybrid mesh which combines both structured and unstructured process?

> Whether the computational model will need a fine surface mesh everywhere?

Figure 3.3.1 shows that the size o f the computational dom ain can be reduced by introducing symmetry conditions to the wing tip and root o f the extended section of the wing rather than using Pressure far field boundary all around the wing. Symmetry conditions imply that all variables have zero gradients across the boundary. This figure shows both isometric and top views o f the two models that one can adopt to generate the mesh o f the Aurora wing and slat configuration. In a pressure far field boundary type model, the wing is placed at the center o f the domain with 20 mean chord distances from all the sides o f the wing to the far field boundary. Compared to the symmetry/far field model; only the two faces that are parallel to the wing have the pressure far field boundary type. The two faces through the wingtip and wing root o f the symmetry/far field model use symmetry boundary conditions, reducing uimecessary depth to the flow domain and reducing the size o f the computational domain.

The section of the wing given to the researcher is located at around middle o f a half a span of the wing. Placing this section in the center of the Far-Field model will not simulate the same physical conditions since the far field model will introduce horseshow vortices, wliich will create a down wash. Since the symmetry boundary conditions case gives a smaller grid with no loss in applicability, it is tliis configuration that is used to model Aurora wing and slat configuration.

3.4 Creation and refinement of the mesh
Structured and unstructured are two methods of generating meshes of physical domains, each having it's own advantages and disadvantages. Figure 3.4.1 shows both structured and unstructured meshes with same off wall spacing (H).

UNSTRUCTURED

STRUCTURED

Figure 3.4.1: Comparison o f unstructured and structured meshes. Both meshes have sam e o ff wait spacing.

Structured meshes are easier to handle computationally since their connectivity information o f the individual nodes are stored block-to-block compared to the unstructured meshes. This blockto-block storage o f connectivity information takes less memory to store and information can be easily access by the main solver program with less RAM. Structured meshes are difficult to create 38

with discontinuous volumes and complex geometries. Sometimes large volumes must be split into separate continuous smaller volumes in order to create a structured mesh. Splitting volumes and matching nodes of opposite faces of the individual rectilinear domains to create structured meshes can be a time consuming process. In a structured mesh scheme, the number o f mesh elements on the wall and the far field are the same since the structured mesh is generated simply by extruding the nodes on the continuous volume surfaces using a linear function connecting the wall surfaces and the far field boundary. Figure 3.4.2 shows how nodes 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 are superimposed in to the far field boundary as nodes 1', 2', 3', 4' and 5'. It is therefore necessary to have a very fine mesh on the wall surfaces of the continuous volume in order to have a reasonable number of nodes in the Far field boundary.

Two-dimensional study done with multi-element airfoil AGARD AR303 showed that flow separation is evident on the front top section of the slat and the upper surface of the main wing. These results obtained from the 2D multi-element-airfoil were used when meshing the edges and surfaces o f Aurora model, placing a higher number o f nodes in the areas o f expected boundary layer separation. 40

The wall function method is easy to establish with continuous volumes but one might face difficulties with edges that are not perpendicular to the wall surfaces. Figure 3.4.4 shows the boundary layers close to a wing trailing edge. Boundary layers o f both upper and lower surfaces are generated using the boundary layer function available in GAMBIT. T he boundary layer generated irr upper surface o f the wing could not continue along the interior boundary surface unless the surface enclosing wing upper surface and interior boundary surface were split to match the nodes across the boundary layer of the interface. The suitable location to split the surface is shown in dotted lines as long as the angles between this dotted edge and the wing upper surface wing trailing edge are less than 90®.

The rectilinear surface mesh on the interior surfaces starts with y^ of 4 from the wing upper surface and the slat forward surface and increases nodal distance between nodes gradually towards the pressure far field boundary. Tire interior mesh starts from the lower surface o f the wing with higher Y+ compared to the wing upper surface since the flow separation at liigher angle o f attacks occurs mostly on the wing upper surface and also to reduce the number o f nodes o f the overall mesh.

3.5 Assignment o f zone types
Two types of conditions must be specified on each volume. They are Boundary type and Continuum type. Boundary type defines the properties o f the internal and external boundaries and continuum type specifies whether the internal domain is either fluid or solid. Available boundary and continuum types may vary from solver to solver. The user is required to select the appropriate solver type before selecting the boundary type. FLUENT version 6 was selected as the solver for Aurora wing and Slat model. The grid generation software, GAMBIT usually selects internal and external boundaries as WALL boundaries and the interfaces between similar FLUID continuum zone types as INTERNAL boundary types. Previous studies discussed in the thesis showed that

49

the best model to use in the Aurora wing and slat model is the pressure far field model with symmetry boundary conditions. The user must carefully assigned appropriate values at the boundaries to represent the correct physical conditions. The values used in Aurora model for appropriate boundaries and assumptions made are given as follows:
1. W all boundary conditions _

#

I
I

&
|

All the wall surfaces on Aurora wing and slat configuration are defined as adiabatic wall boundaries, which are kept at 300° K. Aluminum is selected as the material for wall boundaries with a default roughness constant of 0.5.
2. Internal boundary conditions

J f

All internal faces o f the model, created when splitting volumes to ease the modeling process in GAMBIT, are usually defined as internal faces by default. These internal boundaries do not have a finite thickness and these faces are used as cell faces o f the internal domain.
3. Sym m etry boundary conditions

The Symmetry boundary type introduces zero flux o f all quantities across this boundary. The normal velocity component across the symmetry plane is zero. Since the shear stress is zero at a symmetry boundary, it can also be interpreted as a "slip" wall for viscous flow calculations. The planes going th ro n g the two end faces o f the wing are used as symmetry boundary conditions to reduce the extent o f the computational domain.
4 Pressure far field boundary conditions

The Aurora aircraft goes through a range o f angle o f attacks during take-off and landing. Generating computational models for every angle o f attack would be very time consuming. One can avoid remodeling the computational model by simply changing the direction o f the fi'ee-stream velocity. This can be done by introducing Pressure far-field boundary conditions available to model a free-stream condition at infinity, with specified free-stream M ach number and static conditions. Pressure F a r-fie ld boundary use non-reflective boundary conditions, which allow

conditions in the far field. The user has to remember that this pressure far field boundary condition is valid only when the density o f the external flow is calculated using the ideal gas law. The total temperature o f 300 K and a recommended turbulent viscosity ratio o f 10 [33] is used after introducing appropriate unit vector components into X, Y and Z directions based on the angle attack o f the fi'ee stream.

4.1 Numerical techniques used in CFD
There are three main numerical solution techniques use in CFD. They are, 1. Finite volume method 2. Finite difference 3. Finite element method The Finite volume method is very common among commercially available CFD software such as FLUENT, PHOENICS, FLOW3D and STAR-CD [34]. All these three numerical techniques use similar steps when finding solutions. Each method uses a unique discretization technique to approximate the Navier-Stokes equations such that relations of flow variables are represented by linear algebraic equations. According to Malalasekara W [34], the main differences between the three separate techniques are associated with the way the flow variables are approximated within the discretization process. The computer power needed to reduce aU the scales o f the turbulent motion for a full 3D model o f Aurora Wing and Slat is beyond all the capabihties at present. FLUENT 6 uses the ReynoldsAveraged approach (RANS) with an eddy viscosity turbulence model to transform the Full NavierStokes Equations ( FNSE) into a solvable and simplified equations.

etc. The effect of turbulence is imposed on the mean flow by assuming that turbulence in

the Reynolds stress appears as additional viscosity within the RANS equations. The Spalart-Allmaras model, K-g model, K-co model, Reynolds Stress model (RSM) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model are few turbulence models that are used in FLUENT to model viscous effects [33]. Adding additional equations to model turbulence will substantially increases run time especially if the turbulence model uses more than one equation. So it is important for the user to find the appropriate viscous model to solve the problem with optimizing RAM and CPU

4.2.1 Comparison of viscous models
The Sparlat-Allmaras model uses one conservation equation to define the behavior o f a `turbulence' variable. K-epsilon model use 2 equations and Reynolds Stress model uses 5 equations [33] Validations and selection of these turbulence models in FLUENT is extremely important since the results o f all the viscous flow phenomenon depend on the viscous models. A sensitivity study of these 4 turbulence models was done solving the 2D model o f the NACA 0012 airfoil using FLUENT 5.4 solver. The 2D model was generated using a structured mesh with 5842 nodes using GMABIT and making sure the off wall spacing is within the required range to model the boundary layer for respective turbulence models.

Figure 4.2.1 shows the pressure distribution around the NACA 0012 airfoil found using FLUENT simulation. FLUENT was run on Sun Ultra 60 machine using UNIX operating system. The CPU speed o f this machine is 450 MHz and the computer has 1 GB o f RAM. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number defines the local time step size in proportion to a grid and solution dependent stability limit. The default CFL value of 5 was used with a coupled solver with an implicit numerical solver. The Sparlet-Allmaras model (SA), k-epsilon (k-e) and Reynolds Stress (LES) model were run using a coupled, implicit and steady numerical scheme with 0.01 time step size and with 20 maximum iterations per time step to find which configuration consumes less time with minimum RAM to get coefficient results within 5% of the experimental results.

4 to control the solution process by solving the governing equations separately. The only disadvantage in this method is that the user cannot use an explicit method to formulate the equations. In a coupled solution algorithm, the user can select either the implicit or explicit method to formulate the equations. This method simultaneously solves all the governing equations and the user does not have the freedom to isolate the equations to accelerate the solution-process. One should have an idea o f the computer power available to solve the problem before deciding which formulation method to select. Normally the implicit formulation method of equations requires more memory compared to the explicit formulation method. The Aurora wing and slat arm model has 1.1 million nodes. The implicit model o f Aurora wing and Slat configuration needs almost 3 Gb of RAM compared to the explicit model, which uses only 1Gb o f RAM to formulate the matrices required to solve the problem. It was impossible for the user to load the implicit case It! u.e Sun Ultra 60 Dual processor machines which has only 1 Gb o f RAIvI since the machine
sla> ^d using its reserved memory in the swap space with an lO ratio close to zero. The explicit

model took only 10 minutes to load and consumed the entire RAM available in the machine and used only 0.5 GB o f swap space.

4.4 Selection o f appropriate time step
There is no straightforward method to select the correct time step for a given problem. There are some strategies one can follow to select the time step size. They can be itemized as below. 1. Maximum CFL number for the explicit method is 1 based on linear stability analysis, maybe up to 2.5 with residual smoothing. 2. According to linear stability theory, there is no limit in CFL number for implicit method but the practice cases run by the author using FLUENT showed that CFL number 10 gave best results. 56

3. User must start the solution process with a small time step with CFL number o f 0.1 for I I explicit and 1 for implicit and should slowly increases the time step as solution instabilities subside. Studies done by the user with a Multi Element airfoil with implicit and explicit time integration method showed that the implicit formulation method is conditionally stable with_respect to time step size. Selection o f an optional time step size for a given problem is problem specific. The time step-size is determine by the global unsteadiness of the solutions as they evolve, requiring an optimum time step size in order to converge the solutions in timely manner, which can be found using a trial and error basis.

The discretization scheme for both flow and turbulent viscosity were found using first order upwind scheme with no multigrid solver since multigrid solver took longer to perform relative results in comparison to results achieved without multigrid scheme.

5.1 Basic equations in fluid dynamics
The finite volume method consists o f three main steps. The first step is fonnal integration o f the governing equation over every control volumes. Second step is discretization o f the governing equations to convert the integral equation into a system o f algebraic equations. The final step is to solve the algebraic equations by an iterative method [34]. The fbimal governing equations in fluid dynamics are the Full Navier-Stokes Equations (FNSE) in integral form, which is capable o f expressing any flow scenario. The computer power required to find the direct flow solutions for FNSE with fully turbulent flow is highly phenomenal for a problem in the nature o f Aurora wing and slat configuration. Instead, FLUENT uses averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations which uses time averaged quantities. The integral form o f the RANS equations is the basis for the discretization employed by FLLIENT,

The discrete second phase is in a Lagrangian frame o f reference [23] [37]. .fhis second phase can consist o f ^ h erical inert particles, droplets or bubbles. The trajectories o f discrete particles are computed coupling both discrete and continuous phases. This was achieved keeping track o f the heat, mass and momentum gained or lost by the particles and incorporating them in the continuous flow.

6.1 Fuselage effect on the wing
The assumptions made to model the base model are valid only when there are no significant effects due to the fuselage on wing performance. Modeling the fuselage with the same dimensions as the Aurora aircraft with a similar wing will give a valid comparison o f the base model and the base model with the fuselage. A full 3D model o f an aircraft without high lift devices and empennage was modeled using FLUENT to find the effect o f the fuselage on the section of the base model. The full 3D model has the general dimension such as length, width and height of the Aurora aircraft [1]. A one half of the aircraft was built introducing a symmetry boundary conditions across the plane running tlirough the fuselage dividing the whole aircraft into two equal parts as shown in figure 6.1.1.

significant change in the direction. All the otlier vectors especially in the region where the base model is located, 71.96-313.96 inches from the fuselage show no change in the direction. These results confirm that there is no effect on the direction o f the flow o f the free stream in the base model due to presence o f the fuselage. Figure 6.1.3 shows tlie pressure contours o f selected planes and a sketch o f Aurora wing and the location o f the base model with respect to the ftiselage. These two planes are parallel to the symmetry plane and are located at 71.96 and 313.96 inches away from the wing root. The pressure contours of a plane running perpendicular to the symmetry and through the center of the fuselage are shown below the aircraft. This plane is shifted below the fuselage for visualization purposes and clarity. Pressure contours of this plane perpendicular to the symmetry shows that contours emanate from the fiiselage do not span into the location of the base model. This confirms that there are no significant effects on the static pressure due to the fuselage on the base model. Figures 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 also show the pressure field, with and without fuselage respectively. These pressure fields consist of filled contours o f pressure on the wing and pressure contours o f the planes parallel to the symmetry planes located at the ends of the base model. These pressure fields show no significant differences except the filled contours close to the fuselage on the wing o f the model with the fiiselage. The velocity vector plots and the pressure contours m the 3D aircraft models confirmed that assumed free stream boundary conditions adopted in the base model are reasonable and valid and there are no effects due to fuselage on the base model. This proof is valid only for the base model located at 76.96 inches away from the wing root.

Overall Cp of the locations at 0, 25, 32.5, 62.5, 75 and 100% have similar trends in both slat door closed and slat door opened configurations. The 50% location, where the slat arm is located shows a significant difference in Cp distributions between the two models. The maximum negative Cp of the door opened model at 50% location is 4.5 at the upper surface o f the wing just above the slat arm compared to 2.5 at the same location in the Door Closed model. Further investigation of the solutions at this location shows a low-pressure area on the upper surface of the wing just above the slat arm as shown in figure 6.3.9. This figure shows the pressure contours of an imaginary plane above the wing upper surface running perpendicular to 50 % location plane.

Figure 6.4.1 shows the shear stress distribution along the upper surface of the wing of slat door closed and slat door opened models at angle of attack of 17.5*^.These contours shows the shear stress in the range of 0 to 5 Pascal only and the regions without contours (white) have shear stress higher than 5 Pascal. The results show that both models have a zero shear stress region towards the wing tip resulting in flow separation. Comparison of shear stress contours of the two models also shows a present of another zero shear stress region only in the opened model in the wake of the slat door. These results clearly showed that the open door configuration contributed to a local reduction in stall angle confirming the results found in C^vs. angle o f attack curves and increased the local flow separation area on the top surface o f the wing by 42.81% with reference to tire closed model.

These two vortexes are present in both models but the contours o f turbulent viscosity ratio above the wing without the slat arm door shows an increase in activity in these two vortexes. Figures 6.5.2 and 6.5.3 also show the turbulent viscosity ratio o f several planes at 20, 30, 40 and 50 % o f the wing chord aft the wing fixed leading edge, for door closed and door opened models respectively.

The model without the slat arm shows that extra vorticity created due the absence of the slat door increases the intensity of the combined vortex as flow over the wing travels towards the trailing edge of the wing. This extra disturbance clearly contributed to the decreased stall angle downstream o f the slat in the open door state.

6.6 Dispersion of contaminants in the slat arm compartment
The gap between slat and the slat arm door in Aurora is very narrow and is on the order of 10'' mm. A possibility exits for contamination to build up in the slat box compartment region, initiating crevice corrosion which would cause problems in the deployment o f slat arm during take off and landing. The diameters of these contaminants that can get into the slat box through the crevice may vary from micron size to an average size of a rain droplet. It is important to find out how long these particles stay inside the Slat Box compartment and whether the present o f the slat door is affecting the residence time of these particles. The residence time o f these particles will affect the chance of corrosion. This problem can be modeled using the injection of particles into the airstreams at the entrance o f the slat box compartment as shown in figure 6.6.1.

Figure 6.6.4 shows that the majority o f the particles that go into the door closed models at 15® o f angle o f attack get shot back out through the channel in the slat arm.

This report has presented a numerical investigation o f the effects o f the slat arm door on a Aurora aircraft. The slat arm door is deployed when the aircraft is in low speed flight during take off and landing and partially covers the compartment that houses the slat arm. Results o f numerical models studies o f the Aurora wing and the Slat Arm with and without the Slat Arm Door showed significant differences among quantitative results, such as lift, drag, particles residence time, and an effect on fundamental concepts, such as separation and formation of vortices. These results can be summarized as follows.

7.1 Summary
1. Lift and D rag: Computed results through CFD calculations showed that there is a 1.29% increase in Ctmax iu the door-closed model compared to the door-opened model. Results also showed that the presence o f the slat door reduced the drag by 0.88 % at Cimax. These results show that present o f one slat door having an average surface area 95.35 cm^ can create a significant change in drag and the lift in comparison to the lift and the drag that a 24.71 m^ section o f the wing can produce.

2. C ontam ination residence Time: Sulfur particles, which are released from the rectangular surface just under the slat arm into the compartment that houses the slat arm, showed that the presence o f the slat door reduced the residence time o f these particles by 200.00 % at 17.5° o f angle of attack compared to the model without the slat door. 3. Flow separation: The presence of the slat door in the closed model showed a dramatic effect on the flow stability over the upper surface o f the wing aft the slat arm. The presence o f the door reduced the separation region compared to the door opened model. At 17.5° angle o f attack, the presence o f slat door reduced the local flow separation area over the wing upper surface by 42.81 % with respect to the slat door closed model. 4. V ortex shedding: Only the door opened model showed the presence o f an extra vortex emanating from the slat arm door housing lifting the flow over the upper surface o f the wing. The current work provides new insight into the interior aerodynamics o f wing structures. It offers a qualitative study o f lift and drag effects and contaminations residence time, which was difficult to determine through traditional experimental methods. The use o f a hybrid grid system for the Aurora wing makes it possible to develop a grid system in a few months compared to a fully structured mesh that would take longer.

7.2 Future challenges
1. Further studies need to be done to quantify the effects o f increased residence time of contaminant in the compartment that houses the slat arm and to see whether there is excessive crevice corrosion in other passenger aircraft which are equipped with slat doors.

2. Both slat door closed and opened models showed the presence of two vortices over the upper surface o f the wing aft the slat arm. Further studies should be done to see whether they are created due to the shaip edges o f the slat arm and to see if rounding off these edges or changing the shape of the slat arm can reduce the strength or completely remove these two vortices that contribute to premature flow separation over the upper surface o f the wing.
