HYGROTHERMAL PERFORMANCE OF HIGHLY INSULATED WOOD FRAME WALLS WITH AIR  LEAKAGE: FIELD MEASUREMENTS AND SIMULATIONS 
    By  Michael John Fox  Master of Applied Science in Building Science, 2014  Ryerson University, Toronto     

ABSTRACT
This  thesis  examines  the  hygrothermal  performance  of  six  types  of  high  thermal  resistance  (High  RSI)  wall  assemblies  during  environmental  exposure  and  an  air  leakage  (exfiltration)  simulation  test.  These  walls  were  installed  in  the  Building  Engineering  Group's  test  facility  (BEG  Hut)  located  at  the  University  of  Waterloo.  The  HighRSI  woodframe  walls  were  assessed  by  analyzing  condensation,  mould,  and  decay  risks  using  the  moisture  content,  temperature,  relative  humidity  and  heat  flux  data  collected  during  the  field  test.  These  fieldmeasured  data  were  also  used  to  calibrate  onedimensional  WUFI®  simulation  models  for  each  of  the  HighRSI  assembly  for  use  in  future  durability  assessments  using  a  range  of  North  American  climates.  Methods  were  investigated  to  improve  the  predictive  capacity  of  these  simulation  models  as  well  as  to  increase  their  utility  as  a  research  tool.  The  design,  construction  and instrumentation details of the HighRSI study were also documented.

1 INTRODUCTION
Climate  change  and  increasing  commodity  prices  have  led  to  governments  mandating  greater  energy  efficiency  in  building  codes  throughout  Canada  and  the  US.  Increased  energy  efficiency  requires  higher  levels  of  insulation  in  envelope  assemblies  beyond  what  is  now  achieved  with  traditional  38  x  88  mm  and  38  x  140  mm  wood  framing  and  cavity  insulation.  Increased  insulation  thicknesses  will  lead  to  dramatic  changes  in  building  design,  which  may  unintentionally  affect  the  longterm  durability  of  wood based structural elements. Whether the efficiency gains are achieved through deeper framing cavities or  externally  insulated  traditionally  framed  wall  assemblies,  understanding  the  risks  of  interstitial  condensation  arising  from  moisture  loads  and  air  leakage  is  necessary  in  order  to  determine  design  limitations.   To  investigate  these  potential  risks  and  design  limitations,  six  high  thermal  resistance  (RSI)  wall  assemblies  were  constructed  at  a  field  test  facility  at  the  University  of  Waterloo's  Building  Engineering  Group's   test  facility  (BEG  Hut).  This  High  RSI  wall  study  is  part  of  the  NSERC  strategic  research  Network  for  Engineered  Woodbased  Buildings  Systems  (NEWBuildS).  NEWBuildS  is  a  multidisciplinary  network  of  researchers  focused  on  various  aspects  of  engineered  wood  products,  their  integration  and  advancement  in  modern  construction.  An  important  technical  goal  of  this  network  is  the  development  of  technical  tools  and  design  criteria  for  use  by  engineers,  researchers,  and  product  manufacturers.  The  high  RSI  wall  study  was  part  of  NEWBuildS  Theme  4:  Building  systems  ­  durability,  sustainability  and  enhanced  products.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  the  development  of  advanced  knowledge  and  best  practices  in  the  construction  and  design  of  energy  efficient,  cost  effective  and  sustainable  residential  buildings with ensured longterm durability.  

1.1 Overview of the High RSI wall study
Recent  research  (Armstrong,  Maref,  Rousseau,  Lei  and  Nicholls,  2010)  has  identified  the  potential  for  moisture related  damage  arising from  air leakage in conventional light wood framed walls  installed with  low  water  vapour  permeability  exteriorinsulation.  The  need  for  performance  details  related  to  the  impact  of  air  leakage  and  the  drying  capacity  of  not  only  exterior  insulated  walls,  but  deep  cavity  walls  has  also  been  identified  (Straube,  2010).  The  High  RSI  wall  project  was  designed  to  document  the  moisture performance and durability of exterior insulated and deep cavity walls concurrently in a typical  Canadian cold climate with active air leakage and water leakage testing. 

1   

  The  High  RSI  wall  assemblies  used  in  this  study  were  allowed  to  acclimate  during  a  baseline  period  or  passive  phase  where  climatic  moisture  responses  of  the  woodbased  materials  could  be  assessed  prior  to active moisture loading. The active moisture loads were applied by simulating exfiltration through the  injection  of  interior  air  into  the  central  stud  bay  of  each  test  assembly  and  by  injecting  liquid  water  behind the air barrier on the exterior surface of the sheathing. The impacts of increased insulation levels  on  the  moisture  content  (MC)  of  woodbased  components  were  monitored  using  electric  moisture  content  sensors  placed  in  the  sheathing  and  framing  plates.  Through  the  inclusion  of  a  Part  9  Ontario  Building  Code  compliant  datum  wall  in  the  study,  the  risks  associated  with  increased  insulation  levels  could be quantified relative to current code compliant practices.   In  addition  to  the  MCdata,  temperature,  relative  humidity  (RH),  heat  flux  data,  as  well  as  climate  data  were  collected  for  analysis.  These  datasets  were  used  to  calibrate  the  hygrothermal  simulation  models  (WUFI®)  with  the  climate  data  in  order  to  optimize  the  predictive  capacity  of  the  models  and  increase  their  utility  as  a  research  tool.  Using  the  hygrothermal  simulation  models  calibrated  to  fullscale  field  test  data;  this  study  assessed  condensation  risks,  drying  potential  and  inservice  durability  with  the  intent  of  developing  climatesensitive  design  guidelines.  These  guidelines  will  help  ensure  the  compliance of high RSI value wall assemblies with increasingly stringent building codes. 

1.2 Material selection and design
The  High  RSI  walls  selected  for  this  study  target  the  design  and  construction  of  OBC  Part  4  platform  woodframe  and  woodhybrid  buildings  (including  midrise)  as  well  as  OBC  Part  9  for  residential  houses  and  small  buildings.  The  wall  types  selected  for  this  study  are  readily  adaptable  to  meet  the  anticipated  50% increase to current building code requirements of RSI 3.9 to RSI 6.   The  different  ways  to  achieve  higher  thermal  resistance  levels  include  increased  wall  widths  to  accommodate  thicker  cavity  insulation  as  well  as  the  combination  of  different  types  of  insulation  materials  like  rigid  or  semirigid  exterior  insulation.  The  hygrothermal  behaviour  of  each  wall  assembly  varies  according  to  climatic  conditions,  which  results  in  different  performance  and  durability  profiles.  From these performance data, the potential weaknesses of the selected High RSI wall assemblies can be  identified.   Densepack  cellulose  insulation  was  chosen  for  two  of  the  deep  cavity  wall  types  because  of  its  hygroscopic  nature  and  moisture  buffering  capacity  as  well  as  its  cost  profile.  The  framing  designs  used  2   

  in  these  deep  cavity  walls  included  a  double  stud  wall  and  an  IJoist  stud  wall.  Thermal  bridging  in  the  double  stud  wall  was  reduced  by  the  insulated  space  between  the  two  stud  frames,  while  the  thin,  11.1  mm OSB web of the I Joist wall was the limiting factor for thermal bridging in this wall type.   Another deep cavity wall was also included in this study that used 38x184 mm framing installed with 160  mm  of  closedcell  spray  polyurethane  foam  (ccSPF).  The  purpose  of  this  wall  was  to  contrast  the  high  thermal resistance of the ccSPF foam with the thermal bridging effects of the 184 mm framing.   The exterior insulated walls were constructed using the same 38x140 mm framing as the datum wall and  fitted  with  fibreglass  cavity  insulation  because  of  its  greater  susceptibility  to  moisture  damage  than  mineral  wool.  The  three  exterior  insulation  types  were  selected  from  common  materials  that  could  readily  increase  the  thermal  resistance  of  the  datum  wall  by  50%  (~RSI  2.1).  The  thickness  of  each  insulation  type  was  designed  to  add  approximately  equivalent  amounts  of  thermal  resistance  to  each  wall. Two of the three exterior insulation types selected were rigid products (extruded polystyrene [XPS]  and polyisocyanurate) with low water vapour permeance values at their installed thicknesses. These two  insulation types were contrast with the high water vapour permeability of the third, semirigid insulation  composed of mineral wool.  

1.3 Experiment methodology
The six high RSI wall assemblies used in this study were installed at the BEG Hut test facility in Waterloo,  Ontario during the July and August 2012. Of the six high RSI wall designs in this study, three investigated  the  relative  performance  of  exterior  insulation  (polyisocyanurate,  extruded  polystyrene  and  mineral  wool)  on  traditional  38  x  140  mm  framed  walls  with  fibreglass  cavity  insulation.  The  installed  thermal  resistance  of  these  test  walls  averaged  RSI  6.0.  Two  other  wall  types  investigated  the  performance  of  the  deep  framing  cavities  filled  with  densepack  cellulose  insulation.  These  deep  cavity  walls  were  constructed  using 286 mm cavity  double stud or 241 mm  cavity IJoist stud framing  that accommodated  installed thermal resistances of RSI 6.8 and RSI 5.8 respectively.   Two  test  panels  of  each  of  these  five  wall  types  were  built  and  installed  on  north  and  south  facing  orientations  in  order  to  compare  the  effects  of  direct  solar  radiation  on  moisture  transport  and  storage.  The data from these two orientations help to create a more complete estimation of each wall's expected  inservice durability. A standard 38 x 140 mm framed wall with fibreglass cavity insulation (RSI 3.87) type  was also included as a performance datum for both the north and south facing wall assemblies.   3   

  Finally,  a  third  deep  cavity  wall  was  constructed  with  38  x  184  mm  framing  and  insulated  with  152  mm  of  closedcell  polyurethane  spray  foam  insulation  (ccSPF)  for  an  installed  thermal  resistance  of  RSI  6.4.  Due to space limitations at the BEG Hut, this wall was only oriented with a southern exposure.   The  drying  capacity  of  each  wall  was  assessed  under  typical  indoor  conditions  and  climatic  exposure.  In  addition, each wall was evaluated with an air injection test to simulate air leakage and an exterior water  leakage  test  to  simulate  rain  infiltration.  The  moisture  content  of  the  oriented  strand  board  (OSB)  sheathing  was  used  as  the  primary  performance  criterion  for  the  determination  of  durability  and  drying  potential.  

1.4 Experimental approach
The  six  high  RSI  wall  and  the  datum  test  wall  used  in  this  study  were  represented  by  1.2  x  2.4  m  test  panels  installed  in  the  north  and  south  facing  walls  of  the  BEG  Hut  test  facility.  The  BEG  Hut  facility  was  designed  to  maintain  a  controlled  indoor  climate  while  exposing  the  test  panels  to  exterior  climate  conditions. The test panels were designed to hygrothermally isolate one fullscale framing cavity of each  wall  type,  which  were  then  monitored  using  temperature,  relative  humidity  (RH)  and  moisture  content  sensors to show their response to the environmental conditions.   The test panels were instrumented with moisture sensors to monitor the moisture content of the wood based framing and sheathing of the central framing cavity, while RH sensors were installed in the centre  of  the  framing  cavity  and  the  exterior  drainage  space  to  determine  vapour  pressure  differentials  across  the  wall  components.  Temperature  sensors  were  placed  with  each  moisture  content  and  RH  sensors  as  well as on the interior and exterior surfaces.   Data  collected  from  these  sensors  were  evaluated  based  on  wall  type  and  orientation  through  three  distinct study intervals:  1. A fall/winter baseline period from October to midFebruary,  2. A wintertime air leakage test from midFebruary to early April, and  3. A springtime drying period extending from early April to early June  The variability of vapour pressure in response to climatic conditions was monitored and its effect on the  moisture  content  of  the  OSB  sheathing  was  evaluated  over  the  three  study  intervals.  Selected  weather  events  were  examined  to  determine  the  ability  of  each  wall  assembly  to  manage  specific  instances  of  4   

  environmental  moisture  load.  Extensive  modeling  was  then  performed  to  determine  model  sensitivities  to  boundary  conditions,  input  parameters,  and  material  properties.  The  datum  wall  was  used  to  refine  and calibrate the initial WUFI® model prior to expanding it to the high RSI wall designs.  

1.5 Thesis objectives
The  objective  of  this  thesis  was  the  documentation  of  the  experimental  setup,  data  acquisition  and  analysis of the High RSI walls through three segments of the study period. The High RSI and datum walls  were  analysed  for  mould  and  decay  risks  during  the  baseline  period,  the  air  injection  period,  as  well  as  the subsequent drying period.   To  meet  the  High  RSI  wall  study's  objective  of  developing  climatesensitive  guidelines  for  each  test  wall,  accurate  hygrothermal  simulation  models  were  required  to  assess  the  performance  of  each  wall  when  subjected  to  the  range  of  North  American  climates.  Literature  indicated  the  absence  of  a  well documented  approach  to  establishing  accurate  hygrothermal  models  of  light  wood  frame  walls.  The  secondary  objective  of  this  thesis  was  to  encapsulate  the  physical  principles  required  to  simulate  wall  performance  with  a  high  level  of  precision  and  to  develop  an  approach  for  the  creation  and  calibration  of hygrothermal simulation models.   The  creation  of  wellcalibrated  hygrothermal  models  will  also  permit  experimentation  with  wall  designs  to  explore  potential  solutions  to  durability  issues.  These  models  will  also  assist  in  planning  future  work  related to more advanced High RSI walls.  

1.6 Thesis outline
This  thesis  presents  a  review  of  the  properties  of  woodbased  materials,  the  role  of  vapour  retarders  in  moisture  management,  the  methodology  of  electric  moisture  sensors,  and  the  risk  factors  relating  to  woodbased  materials  in  Chapter  2.  Chapter  3  contains  the  experimental  design  and  test  procedures  along  with  the  instrumentation  details.  The  hygrothermal  analyses  of  the  HighRSI  wall  assemblies  presented  in  Chapter  4  include  vertical  temperature  and  moisture  content  variations,  condensation,  mould  and  decay  risks,  as  well  as  interwall  performance  comparisons  and  thermal  analysis  using  the  heatflux  sensor  data.  The  calibration  methodology  and  results  of  the  hygrothermal  simulations  are  presented in Chapter 5.

  The  data  collected  during  the  study  period  were  used  to  assess  the  thermal  and  moisture  performance  of High RSI walls. The vertical temperature profiles were examined to determine the typical temperature  variability  and  its  implications  for  data  quality  and  moisture  content  interpretation.  The  vertical  variability  of  moisture  content  was  also  assessed  to  determine  wallrelated  performance  issues  like  the  initial  moisture  content  of  cellulose  insulation.  The  moisture  content  data  were  further  analysed  with  the  temperature  and  relative  humidity  data  to  determine  mould  and  decay  risks  for  each  of  the  test  walls  during  three  phases  of  the  wall  study.  The  thermal  performance  of  a  four  wall  types  were  also  investigated  using  the  heatflux  sensor  data.  The  role  of  vapour  drive  with  respect  to  drying  potential  was also examined.  Hygrothermal  models  of  the  High  RSI  test  walls  were  created  to  examine  the  interactions  between  climatic  conditions,  material  properties,  electrical  sensor  measurement,  and  simulated  air  leakage.  The  models  were  calibrated  to  the  measured  data  recorded  between  October  4,  2012  and  June  3,  2013.  During  the  calibration  process,  the  seasonal  variations  of  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  were  investigated and their effect on the temperature and relative humidity regimes explored. The simulation  models  used  in  this  study  were  configured  to  allow  various  investigations  of  the  factors  influencing  the  flow of heat and moisture through the High RSI walls. The aim of this model study was to create reliable  simulation  models  that  could  be  applied  to  regional  performance  studies  as  well  as  material  and  component oriented investigations.

2 BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Energy efficiency and code standards
Energy  use  in  Canada  is  tracked  by  natural  resources  Canada  (NRCan)  through  the  office  of  energy  efficiency  (OEE).  The  residential  sector  accounts  for  17%  of  the  secondary  energy  use  in  Canada,  of  which,  63%  of  the  energy  consumed  was  used  for  space  heating.  Energy  consumption  in  the  residential  sector  has  grown  since  1990  due  to  increased  sector  activity,  which  was  driven  by  population  growth  and the combined trends of larger house sizes with fewer occupants (OEE, 2012). As the amount of floor  space  per  occupant  increases,  the  impact  of  more  energy  efficient  wall  systems  can  have  a  greater  influence  on  the  energy  efficiency  gains  for  both  new  construction  and  upgrades  to  existing  structures.  Figure  21  shows  the  distribution  of  residential  Canadian  housing  units  as  of  2008.  The  largest  portion  of  Canadian  housing  occupies  single  detached  homes,  which  means  that  envelope 

improvements  to  this  segment  will  be  most  effective in reducing overall energy demand.  Energy  efficiency  requirements  for  buildings  within  national,  provincial,  and  municipal 
Figure 21 Distribution of Canadian residential housing typesasof2008

building  codes  across  Canada  and  the  US  have  been  rapidly  changing  in  recent  years  to 

address  building  envelope  efficiency.  In  2012,  Supplementary  standard  SB12  was  enacted  for  the  Ontario  Building  Code  (OBC)  to  increase  the  energy  efficiency  of  new  buildings  (OMMAH,  2011).  SB12  accomplishes  this  through  prescriptive  compliance  packages  that  designate  acceptable  levels  of  thermal  resistance  in  the  various  components  of  the  building  envelope  based  on  heating  equipment,  fuel  type  and  location.  The  thermal  insulation  requirements  for  above  grade  walls  listed  in  the  compliance  packages  range  from  RSI  3.87  to  5.11  (R22  to  R29)  with  no  consideration  for  thermal  bridging  through  framing  members  (OMMAH,  2011).  The  OBC  SB12  is  intended  to  be  an  alternative  for  EnerGuide  rating  80  for  building  enclosures  and  streamlines  the  process  for  designers/  builders  through  the  adoption  of  compliance  packages.  The  thermal  insulation  component  of  the  high  RSI  walls  in  this  study  ranged  from  7   

  RSI  5.75  to  6.80  (R33  to  R39)  and  are  compared  to  a  38  x  140  mm  framed  wall  with  RSI  3.87  cavity  insulation as a datum.  The  EnerGuide  rating  system  is  a  standard  measure  for  energy  efficiency  in  housing  that  provides  a  rating  between  0  and  100  based  on  a  standard  set  of  operating  assumptions.  A  rating  of  0  signifies  a  structure  with  serious  air  leakage,  poor  to  no  insulation  and  its  consequent  high  levels  of  energy  consumption;  essentially  an  uninhabitable  building.  The  EnerGuide  rating  for  new  houses  built  to  code  standards  is  typically  between  65  and  72.  A  rating  of  100  is  achieved  with  levels  of  insulation  and  air  sealing  such  that  the  building  does  not  require  the  purchase  of  external  energy  in  normal  operation  (OEENRC,  2010).  The  objectives  of  `Net  Zero  ready'  and  carbon  neutral  construction  would  require  EnerGuide  ratings  between  91  and  100,  which  render  the  current  building  practices  and  code  standards  insufficient  to  meet  these  energy  efficiency  demands  through  light  wood  framing  and  cavity  insulation  alone.  The  changes  in  building  design  and  materials  that  will  arise  from  increased  energy  efficiency  targets,  may  have  unintended  consequences  with  respect  the  building  envelope's  ability  to  manage  moisture and increase the risk of decay in structural wood components.  

2.2 Wall assemblies - functions and control layers
The primary function of building envelopes is to isolate the controlled environment of the interior space  from  the  everchanging  exterior  climatic  conditions.  In  performing  this  task,  the  envelope  is  required  to  be durable enough to withstand the elements and  manage moisture while maintaining the aesthetics  of  the  building.  N.B.  Hutcheon  identified  the  need  for  systematic  design  and  careful  consideration  of  how  different building materials interact and perform their functions  within the building envelope. Hutcheon  realized  that  building  science  could  resolve  building  failures  in  an  effective,  timely  and  cost  effective  manner (Hutcheon, 1953).   The principal functions of a wall are to control the flow of heat, air and water vapour. The wall must also  control  the  penetration  of  rain,  light,  solar  radiation,  noise  and  fire  from  the  exterior.  In  doing  so,  the  wall  must  also  provide  strength,  rigidity,  durability,  and  economy.  Depending  on  the  climate  or  geographic  location,  each  of  these  functions  will  vary  in  importance  (Hutcheon,  1963).  In  areas  that  are  frequently  windy,  or  prone  to  hurricane  and  tornado  damage,  strength  and  impact  resistance  are  very  important  considerations.  Historical  communities  may  place  aesthetics  above  other  considerations  and  most importantly, if the wall system is prohibitively expensive, then it will not be built.

  The perfect wall approach builds on these wall functions  and  states  that  there  are  four  principal  layers  in  a  perfect  wall  (listed  in  order  of  importance)  that  control  rain,  air,  water  vapour  and  heat  (Lstiburek,  2007).  In  its  simplest  form,  the  perfect  wall  is  composed  of  the  cladding,  control  layers  and  the  building's  structural  frame  as  shown  in  Figure  22.  The  cladding  protects  the  structure  and  its  more  sensitive  components  from  the  effects  of  solar  radiation,  wind  and  minor  impacts,  insects,  and  can  offer  fire  resistance  depending  upon  its  composition.  The  cladding  is  not  intended  to  be  an 
Figure 22 Control layers of the perfect wall design(Lstiburek,2007)

impenetrable barrier to rain, but rather, it is designed to  shed the majority of precipitation and sunlight.  

The  drainage  space  is  placed  between  the  cladding  and  the  WRB  drainage  layer  to  regulate  air  and  vapour  pressures  through  the  ventilation  ports  as  well  as  along  the  cladding  joints  in  many  types  of  siding.  Air  and  vapour  pressures  in  the  drainage  space  are  influenced  by  solar  heating,  ambient  temperature and humidity as well as wind.   The drainage layer as defined by Straube (2005) consists of a sealed water resistive barrier (WRB) that is  placed  between  the  drainage  space  and  the  structure.  Since  this  barrier  is  protected  from  the  elements  by  the  cladding,  its  integrity  and  effectiveness  is  maintained  for  as  long  as  possible.  When  the  water  resistive  barrier  is  properly  sealed,  an  air  barrier  is  also  created  and  the  first  two  criteria  of  the  perfect  wall  are  met.  The  presence  of  the  air  barrier  on  the  outside  of  the  structure  eliminates  air  leakage  and  wind  washing  of  air  permeable  insulation  materials,  which  optimizes  the  thermal  performance  of  the  assembly.  This  approach  is  also  known  as  a  drainedscreened  wall  system,  which  was  developed  from  rainwater  control  theory  based  on  the  fact  that  rain  in  contact  with  a  wall  can  be  shed,  stored  by  the  cladding  or  transmitted  further  into  the  wall.  Ideally,  water  is  controlled  as  each  successive  layer  of  the  assembly reduces the transmission of water to zero.   The  water  vapour  and  thermal  control  layers  need  to  be  considered  together  as  the  moisture  storage  capacity  of  air  is  directly  related  to  temperature.  As  the  temperature  within  an  assembly  changes  with  variations  in  the  exterior  and  interior  temperatures  (temperature  profile),  the  moisture  capacity  of  the  air  within  the  wall  also  changes,  this  can  lead  to  condensation  within  the  wall  should  the  inner  wall  9   

  temperatures  fall  below  the  dew  point  of  the  air.  In  cold  climates,  the  warm,  moist  interior  air  creates  a  partial  pressure  differential  that  causes  the  outward  flow  of  water  vapour  from  the  interior.  For  this  reason,  the  water  vapour  control  layer  is  typically  applied  to  the  warm  in  winter  side  of  the  assembly  to  restrict  the  outward  flow  of  water  vapour  into  the  wall  where  it  will  condense  on  the  colder  sheathing  surfaces. Only one vapour control layer should be installed, as more vapour barriers would inhibit drying  in the event of accidental water leakage.  The  vapour  control  layer  in  Canada  is  generally  composed  of  a  6mil  polyethylene  sheet  applied  and  sealed  between  the  framing  and  interior  drywall.  The  vapour  control  layer  need  not  be  polyethylene  as  some  low  vapour  permeance  foams  like  closed  cell  spray  polyurethane  foam  (ccSPF),  extruded  polystyrene  (XPS)  or  foil  faced  polyisocyanurate  can  provide  vapour  control  provided  they  are  installed  correctly.  The  insulation  should  be  continuous  and  sealed  across  the  entire  wall  with  proper  detailing  at  wall  openings.  In  addition,  the  insulation  thickness  should  be  sufficient  to  ensure  that  the  temperature  of  its  interior  surface  remains  above  dew  point.  The  Ontario  Building  Code  (OBC)  prescribes  minimum  thermal  resistance  ratios  of  outboard  to  inboard  insulation  in  Part  9.25.1.2  of  the  residential  and  small  housing  section  of  the  OBC  (OMMAH,  2006).  These  ratios  are  based  on  the  number  of  heating  degree days  at  the  geographical  location  of  the  building.  Thermal  insulation  installed  on  the  exterior  of  the  structure  also  protects  it  from  variations  in  temperature  that  can  cause  shifting,  swelling  or  shrinkage  and cracking.  

2.3 Water vapour transport
The  transport  of  water  vapour  in  air  and  porous  media  occurs  through  the  two  dominant  processes  of  diffusion and convective airflow (advection). These processes, as explain by Straube (2005) are driven by  pressure  or  density  gradients  caused  by  temperature  imbalances,  wind  or  mechanical  systems.  Convective  airflow  can  occur  within  a  wall  through  air  permeable  insulation  where  the  vertical  temperature  profile  is  stratified.  This  form  of  air  movement  is  driven  by  the  density  gradients  caused  by  a  temperature  imbalance  and  it  can  cause  convective  loops  within  the  wall  cavity.  When  the  stud  cavity  is  connected  to  the  interior  and  /  or  exterior  spaces,  then  air  leakage  takes  place,  which  has  the  potential to move large amounts of moisture into and out of the wall space.

2.3.1 Diffusion
Water  vapour  molecules  disperse  in  air  through  the  process  of  diffusion,  which  is  similar  to  the  convection transport process on a molecular scale. The rate at which diffusion occurs is governed by the  concentration  gradient  through  space,  which  in  the  case  of  water  vapour  in  air,  is  defined  as  the  partial  pressure  of  water  vapour  relative  to  atmospheric  pressure.  The  mass  flow  rate  of  a  solute  (water  vapour)  through  a  stationary  medium  (air)  can  be  described  using  the  general  mass  flow  equation  for  diffusion of a solute into a medium as defined by the change of mass per unit time using a form of Fick's  Law, derived as follows in Straube, (2005):

   = mass flow per unit time (ng/s)   D   = proportionality constant including the medium's permeability and area (  A)  C   = the concentration of the solute (water vapour), Pa    = the divergence `del' operator (  = i    + j   + k    ),  

D  represents  the  diffusion  coefficient  or  diffusivity.  Diffusivity  is  the  proportionality  constant  between  the  flux  and  the  gradient.  The  negative  sign  indicates  that  the  mass  of  the  solute  flows  from  high  to  low  concentrations.  The  divergence  or  `del'  operator  represents  the  change  in  concentration  (scalar)  throughout  the  3dimensional  basis  vector  field  (i,  j,  k)  of  the  medium.  For  onedimensional  flow,  Fick's  Law can be rewritten as (Hutcheon, 1983):               The  average  vapour  permeability  of  a  material  is  determined  through  standardized  laboratory  tests  like  ASTM  E96  Standard  Test  Methods  for  the  Water  Vapour  Transmission  of  Materials  (ASTM,  2005).  These  tests are conducted on representative  samples of the material with a defined thickness (<32 mm) under  specific  boundary conditions. The test sample is sealed against the open side of a test dish that contains  anhydrous  calcium  chloride  for  the  Desiccant  Method  or  Dry  Cup  test,  or  distilled  water  for  the  Water  Method  or  Wet  Cup  test.  The  sample,  sealed  to  the  test  dish,  is  placed  in  a  test  chamber  with  a  11

  controlled  environment  of  50%  RH  and  an  applicable  temperature  for  the  material's  usage  (ASTM,  2005). The test cup is periodically weighed to determine the rate of vapour flow through the specimen.   The  results  of  the  ASTM  E96  test  are  used  to  calculate  the  water  vapour  permeability  of  the  material  over  its  test  thickness,  generally  25.4  mm,  which  yields  a  unitized  permeability  known  as  permeance.  Permeance (M) has the units of ng/ (Pasm2) and is determined by:     3

Where,  l  =  the  length  (m)  of  the  flow  path  through  the  material.  Building  codes  specify  transmission  rates  for  vapour  retarders  using  permeance  values.  The  2006  Ontario  Building  Code  (OBC)  requires  vapour retarding materials to have a water vapour permeance less than 60 ng/(Pasm2), as measured by  ASTM  E96  (desiccant  method).  Water  vapour  permeance  and  permeability  are  also  defined  in  US  perms  and the Water Vapour Diffusion Resistance (WVDR) Factor. The US perm is based on the imperial system  of measurement; one US perm is the equivalent of 57.2 ng / (Pasm2).  
2.3.1.1

Diffusion control - vapour retarders

The  control  of  water  vapour  diffusion  is  accomplished  using  water  vapour  retarders.  Vapour  retarders  are classified as follows (Lstiburek, 2006):     Class 1 ­ less than 0.1 perm { < 5.72 ng / (Pasm2) }  Class 2 ­ less than 1.0 perm and greater than 0.1 perm { between 57.2 and 5.72 ng / (Pasm2) }  Class 3 ­ greater than 1.0 perm { > 57.2 ng / (Pasm2) }  

A vapour barrier is considered to be a class 1 vapour retarder such as 6mil polyethylene sheeting, which  has  a  water  vapour  permeance  of  3.4  ng  /  (Pasm2)  (ASHRAE,  2009).  The  6mil  polyethylene  provides  a  level  of  vapour  control  an  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  the  minimum  prescribed  in  the  OBC  (60  ng  /  (Pasm2)).  

2.3.2 Water vapour diffusion resistance factor
For  hygrothermal  modeling  using  the  German  modeling  software  WUFI®,  the  WVDR  factor  is  used  to  define  the  water  vapour  permeance  of  building  materials  in  lieu  of  permeance  or  permeability  values  more  commonly  used  in  North  America.  The  diffusion  of  water  vapour  through  porous  materials  can  be  considered the same process as diffusion through air with the exception that diffusive flow is obstructed  within the material by access to open porosity, adsorption at the pore walls and the degree of tortuosity  along  the  interconnected  pore  paths  (WUFI®,  2009).  For  this  reason,  the  value  defines  the  water  12   

  vapour  permeability  of  building  materials  relative  to  the  water  vapour  diffusion  coefficient  in  stagnant  air. The value [] is defined as follows (Kumaran, 1998):        4

   = the water vapour permeability of stagnant air (kg / Pasm )       = the water vapour permeability of the building material (kg / Pasm)   

The  values  of    and    use  to  determine  the  value  should  be  for  the  same  temperature  and  atmospheric  pressure.  The  water  vapour  permeability  of  stagnant  air  is  difficult  to  measure  in  the  laboratory, in part due to the relative pressures of water vapour and the atmosphere. A consistent value  for  has not been determined since the results of theoretical calculations are regularly higher than the  results  determined  through  experimental  measurements  (Kumaran,  1998).  The  standard  equation  adopted for use in WUFI® is as follows (Schirmer, 1938 from WUFI®, 2009):

T  = absolute ambient temperature (K)    Patm  =the atmospheric pressure (Pa) 

Equation  [5]  was  used  to  determine  the  values  of    over  the 20°  to  +38°C  (253  to  309  K)  temperature  range. The average value for  was 190 ng / (Pasm) within a range from 175 to 205 ng / (Pasm).  Like  the  value  of  ,  the  value  for  a  porous  building  material  also  depends  on  air  pressure  and  temperature  since  the  water  vapour  diffusion  through  porous  materials  occurs  through  the  air  in  open  pores.  For  this  reason,  WUFI®  uses  the  units  of  water  vapour  flux  density  and  retains  the   term  by  dividing  by  the  value.  Rearranging  Equation  [2],  the  water  vapour  flux  density  for  a  porous  medium  is  (WUFI®, 2009):

For  materials  like  vapour  barriers  and  surface  coatings,  WUFI®  calculates  the  thickness  of  air  (sd)  that  provides  an  equivalent  resistance  to  diffusion  as  a  porous  material  with  a  thickness  (s)  using  the  relationship:

  The  sd ­value  does  not  require  that  the  thickness  of  the  material  to  be  defined,  so  this  property  can  be  used in all aspects of the program other than just the component assembly.  The value  and    that  is  used  to  represent  a  material's  average  water  vapour  permeability  should  not  be  confused  as  the  value  is  a  dimensionless  coefficient  whose  value  is  relative  to  the  water  vapour  permeability  of  air.  Water  vapour  permeability  is  also  referred  to  as  the  water  vapour  diffusion  coefficient  in  WUFI®  simulation  program.  This  term  should  not  be  confused  with  the  proportionality  constant `D' (diffusivity) from Equation 1. 

2.4 Moisture content and storage
Moisture  content  influences  the  physical  properties  and  behaviour  of  wood  through  dimensional,  thermal and elasticity changes. Wood is an anisotropic material that is created by the addition of circular  growth  rings  throughout  the  life  of  the  tree  as  it  grows  in  height  and  diameter.  The  physical  properties  of woodbased materials depend on the principal growth directions ­ longitudinal, radial and tangential.  Each of these principal directions interacts differently with either liquid water or water vapour based on  geometry  and  exposure  of  the  underlying  cell  structure.  As  an  example,  shrinkage  coefficients  for  several  selected  wood  types  indicate  that  the  maximum  dimensional  change  caused  by  moisture  content  occurs  in  the  tangential  direction.  The  radial  direction  is  also  affected  but  is  generally  less  than  60% of the tangential change while dimensional changes in the longitudinal direction are insignificant by  comparison  (Glass  and  Zelinka,  2010).  This  mechanism  is  responsible  for  many  interior  problems  like  sticking doors and drawers as well as splits, checks and cracks in flooring, trim and furniture.    Moisture content (MC) is calculated as ratio between the mass of water in the specimen and the mass of  dry wood as follows (Glass and Zelinka, 2010): 



  100%

Moisture  may  be  present  in  the  cell  voids  (lumina)  as  mobile  liquid  water  (free  water)  or  water  vapour.  The  moisture  contained  in  the  cell  walls  is  called  bound  water  as  it  is  captured  by  the  matrix  of  the  cellular material. The fibre saturation point (FSP) occurs when the moisture content of the cell walls is at  a  maximum  and  the  RH  of  the  air  in  the  lumen  is  at  100%.  Any  further  additional  water  will  be  added  to  the  wood  as  free  water.  Above  the  FSP,  the  physical  and  mechanical  properties  are  no  longer  directly  a 

14   

  function of moisture content  (Glass and  Zelinka, 2010). Fibre saturation happens at about 30% moisture  content, but it varies among tree species and is not necessarily uniform.  

2.4.1 Water vapour sorption and capillary water
The ability of porous hygroscopic materials to exchange molecules of water vapour with the  ambient air  is an important aspect of building envelope durability. This exchange is known as moisture storage and it  occurs  through  the  process  of  adsorption.  Adsorption  is  governed  by  the  relative  humidity  of  the  air  contained  in  the  envelope  assembly  and  the  pores  of  hygroscopic  materials.  The  polarity  of  the  water  molecule  enables  it  to  bond  with  the  pore  surfaces  of  hygroscopic  materials.  The storage of moisture in this manner acts as  a  buffer  that  moderates  the  flow  of  water  vapour  through  a  wall  assembly  by  raising  the  moisture  content  of  hygroscopic  wall  components.  The  important  concerns  for  durability  are  the  storage  capacity  of  the  material,  the  exchange  rates,  and  the  length  of  time  that  the  moisture  can  be  stored  without  the  onset  of  deterioration.  The  storage  of  moisture  in  this  manner  is 
Figure 23 Moisture storage in hygroscopic materials (Straube,2006)

significantly  affected  by  the  amount  of  open  pore space and surface area.  

Figure 23 illustrates the process of moisture storage in a hygroscopic  material.  In the figure,  adsorption  begins  from  the  dehydrated  state  at  0%  RH  through  the  adsorptive  regions  `A'  &  `B'  until  liquid  water  condenses  within  the  pore  spaces  of  the  material  in  region  `C'.  The  material's  water  content  (W)  is  determined by the relative humidity (of air) throughout the regions `A', `B', and 'C `. Region `D' begins at  the  critical  water  content  (Wcrit)  where  the  process  of  water  accumulation  is  controlled  by  capillary  forces.   The  adsorption  of  water  begins  with  a  singlelayer  of  molecules  that  adhere  to  the  surface  of  the  medium.  As  water  molecules  accumulate,  multiple  layers  are  formed.  Each  successive  layer  is  more 

15   

  weakly bound to the medium than the initial, single layer. As a result, the builtup multimolecular layers  interact  with  one  another  to  create  capillary  condensation  or  unbound  liquid  water  as  the  relative  humidity  rises.  Pore  space  condensation  begins  in  the  smallest  pores  and  proceeds  until  all  but  the  largest  pores  are  filled.  This  point  is  known  as  the  critical  moisture  content  (Wcrit)  as  it  is  the  point  at  which  capillary  forces  begin  to  dominate  moisture  storage  and  the  rate  at  which  water  is  accumulated  by the medium. The critical moisture content in material dependent but is generally considered to occur  in  equilibrium  with  9398%  RH  air  as  reported  by  Straube  (2005).  From  Wcrit  to  the  capillary  saturation  point,  Wcap,  capillary  action  forces  water  into  the  porous  medium.  Above  this  point,  external  forces  are  required to drive water into the material.  

2.4.2 Equilibrium moisture content (EMC)
In  the  sorption  region,  the  equilibrium  water  content  of  the  porous  medium  is  attained  through  a  balance  of  the  absolute  humidity  and  temperature.  Increased  water  vapour  concentrations  deposit  more  water  molecules  on  the  surface  of  the  medium  while  increased  temperatures  desorb  the  water  molecules.  As  a  result,  the  water  content  below  the  fibre  saturation  point  (FSP)  is  determined  by  the  relative humidity of the air temperature.   This  process  is  gradual  and  as  a  result,  daily  temperature  and  RH  fluctuations  only  tend  to  affect  the  wood's  surficial  moisture  content  as  the  wood  equilibrates  with  its  surroundings.  Longerterm  temperature  and  RH  trends  have  a  greater  effect  on  the  overall  moisture  content  of  wood  because  full  equilibration  can  require  several  weeks  depending  on  the  material's  thickness  and  the  degree  of  moisture imbalance. The EMC is reached when the wood no longer exchanges moisture with the air. The  time  required  to  reach  the  EMC  is  influenced  by  the  tree  species,  wax  and  extractive  content  (resin)  of  the  wood.  The  EMC  varies  slightly  between  species  and  is  determined  using  metric  units  through  the  following relationship (Glass and Zelinka, 2010):

Where h is  the relative humidity of  the  air, W and K,  K1 and K2 are temperature dependent  functions (T  in °C) as follows:           W   K  K1  K2  = 349 + 1.29  T + 0.0135  T2  = 0.805 + 0.000736  T ­ 0.00000273  T2  = 6.27 ­ 0.00938  T ­ 0.000303  T2  = 1.91 + 0.0407  T ­ 0.000293  T2  16   

  Equation  9  was  used  to  calculate  the  EMC  for  the  wood  plates  in  the  high  RSI  wall  study  to  determine  if  the  moisture  sensors  were  functioning  correctly  and  measuring  moisture  content  values  within  the  expected range.   A  typical  sorption  /  desorption  isostherm  is  shown  in  Figure  24  (Glass  and  Zelinka,  2010),  this  plot  shows  the  change  in  moisture  content  with  relative  humidity  for  a  constant  temperature.  Wood  is  considered  to  be  `green'  prior  to  drying  or  seasoning  and  the  initial  desorption  line  (Figure  24)  represents  the  drying  curve  from  the  `green'  state  at  equilibrium  with  100%  RH  (roughly  the  FSP)  to  equilibrium  at  0%  RH.  The  resorption  or  adsorption  curve  represents  the  wood's  response  to  increasing  moisture  content  from  a  dried  state  at  0%  RH.  The  difference  between   these  drying  and  wetting  curves  is known as hysteresis.   The  EMC  of  the  lumber  is  highest  when  `green'  and  the  material  equlibrates  at  lower  EMC  for  the  next  adsorption  cycle  (Glass  and  Zelinka,  2010).

from  pressure  plate  measurements  above  95%.   

During  the  manufacture  of  products  like  OSB,  the  wood  fibres  are  compressed  and  adhered  with  thermoplastic  resins  that  reduce  the  amount  of  pore  space  and  the  available  surface  area  for  water  vapour.  This  reduction  in  surface  area  also  reduces  the  amount  of  water  adsorbed  from  the  air  and  results  in  average  moisture  content  measurements  that  are  about  34%  lower  (Forintek  observations  from Straube et al, 2002) in OSB  than  unaltered wood of the same species under similar conditions. The  addition of wax and adhesives impedes the rate of sorption while adding dry mass that does not adsorb.

2.4.3 Absorption
The  process  of  adsorption  continues  until  the  addition  of  multimolecular  layers  begins  to  condense  liquid  capillary  water  in  the  pores.  Some  of  this  pore  water  is  held  or  bound  by  surface  tension  with  the  cell  walls  while  the  remainder  is  driven  into  the  pore  space  by  the  capillary  suction  pressure  created  by  the  surface  tension  of  the  waterair  contact  (Glass  and  Zelinka,  2010).  Capillary  pressure  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  effective  radius  of  the  pore  throat,  which  means  that  smaller  pores  create  greater  capillary  pressures.  The  absorption  process  is  capable  of  raising  the  moisture  content  above  the  fibre  saturation point. Absorption also occurs through contact with liquid water that results from rain leakage  or  condensation.  This  rapidly  increases  the  moisture  content  of  wood  framing  materials  and  it  is  limited  by  access  to  liquid  water  and  the  rate  at  which  air  escapes  the  lumina.  The  absorption  of  liquid  water  is  also  highly  anisotropic  in  wood  with  the  highest  rates  occurring  along  the  longitudinal  axis  ­  in  the  direction  of  sap  flow.  The  absorption  of  water  continues  until  the  capillary  pressure  has  diminished  and  the  capillary  saturation  point  is  reached,  Wcap,  in  Figure  23.  The  principal  grain  directions  of  wood  are  shown in Figure 25 on the following page.  Water  absorption  is  measured  by  tests  that  restrict  the  exposure  of  water  to  a  single  side  of  the  test  sample.  The  sample  is  partially  immersed  in  water  and  weighed  at  set  time  intervals.  The  mass  of  water  absorbed  per  unit  area  of  the  sample's  exposed  surface  are  plot  versus  the  square  root  of  time.  The  slope  of  this  curve  (linear  portion)  is  the  water  absorption  coefficient,  Aw.  The  Awvalues  for  softwood  range  from  1016  g  /m2s1/2  in  the  longitudinal  direction  and  17  g  /m2s1/2  in  the  transverse  direction  (Glass  and  Zelinka,  2010).  The  Awvalues  for  the  panel  surface  of  OSB  range  from  1.1  to  3.3  g  /m2s1/2  (Kumaran, Lackey, Normandin, Tariku, van Reenen, 2003).   The rate at which liquid water flows through a porous material is measured by the parameter, Dw (m2/s)  ­  liquid  water  diffusivity.  Liquid  water  diffusivity  is  defined  as  the  moisture  content  (kg/m3)  through  a  unit  thickness,  m.  The  liquid  transport  coefficients  for  suction  and  redistribution  (Dws,  Dww)  that  were  used in the WUFI® modeling were approximated using the following equation (WUFI®, 2009):

The  test  method  used  to  determine  the  liquid  water  diffusivity  of  OSB  products  (Kumaran  et  al,  2003)  may  involve  the  edge  wood  of  the  OSB  sample.  Since  the  edge  wood  is  biased  with  longitudinal  grains,  the resulting diffusivity values are not necessarily applicable to the panel face in a sheathing application.  For  this  reason,  liquid  water  transport  coefficients  approximated  with  water  absorption  coefficients  determined  from  the  materials'  planar  surfaces  may  be  more  appropriate  for  modeling  sheathing  type  applications.  

2.5 Thermal properties of wood-based materials 2.5.1 The influence of structure
The  structure  of  wood  varies  with  species  and  type,  whether  it  is  a  hardwood  or  softwood.  The  terms  hard  and  soft  are  misnomers  in  a  sense  because  there  are  hard  softwoods  like  Douglas  fir,  and  soft  hardwoods  like  balsa  or  poplar.  Generally,  hardwoods  are  deciduous,  broadleafed  plants  whose  seeds  are  produced  in  the  ovary of  a  flower  and  enclosed  such  as  with  a  fruit  or  nut.  These  types  of  plants  are  called  angiosperms.  Hardwoods  contain  pores  and  their  cell  structure  is  composed  of  vessel  elements  with open ends that stack to form a continuous tube.   Softwoods  differ  from  hardwoods  in  that  their  seeds  are  not  enclosed;  these  are  referred  to  as  gymnosperms. Softwoods are often cone bearing, have needles or scaly leaves and do not have a porous  cell  structure  like  hardwoods  (Glass  and  Zelinka,  2010).  Three  predominant  types  of  softwoods  are  used 

Figure25Longitudinal,tangentialandradialgraindirectionsinwood(Wengert,1993)

  for  framing  in  house  construction  ­  spruce,  pine  and  fir.  Oriented  strand  board  is  made  from  the  fast  growing hardwood species ­ aspen and poplar, although pine is used by some manufacturers.  The  thermal  and  moisture  characteristics  of  woodbased  products  are  influenced  by  the  anisotropy  of  wood's  grain  structure.  The  thermal  conductivity  (kvalue)  of  wood  is  directionally  dependent  with  respect  to  grain.  The  orientation  of  wood  grain  is  defined  as  longitudinal  (L),  tangential  (T)  or  radial  (R)  and  illustrated  in  Figure  25.  The  tangential  kvalue  is  generally  somewhat  less  than  the  radial  kvalue  depending on the amount of ray cells in hardwood and the ratio of earlywood to latewood in softwoods.  Earlywood refers to the fast wood growth of the spring while latewood refers to the slower wood grown  after seeds and leaves have been produced.   The  following  two  images  in  Figure  26  illustrate  the  difference  in  grain  structure  between  hardwoods  (left  image)  and  softwoods  (right  image).  The  ray  cells  of  the  hardwood  are  shown  in  section  on  the  tangential face of the image. The primary functions of ray cells change with the seasonal demands of the  tree  and  are  related  to  the  transport  and  storage  of  fluids.  In  both  hard  and  softwoods,  the  cellular  make up resembles bundles tubes that transport sap to and from the roots through capillary forces. The  open cell voids are known as lumina (singular ­ lumen).   The  righthand  image  of  soft  wood  cell  structure  most  clearly  illustrates  the  difference  between  early  wood  and  latewood.  Early  wood  is  more  porous  to  enhance  fluid  transport  in  spring  for  bud  formation  and defines the rate of longitudinal absorption of fluids.

  The  frequency  of  ray  cells  in  growth  rings  determines  the  magnitude  of  the  difference  between  tangential  and  radial  thermal  conductivities  in  hardwoods  (Kollmann,  1951  (from  Sonderegger,  2009))  and  the  relative  volumes  and  density  differences  of  early  wood  versus  latewood  govern  thermal  anisotropy in softwood lumber (Chudinov, 1968 (from Steinhagen, 1977)).   The  microscopic  variations  in  wood  grain  indicate  that  wood's  anisotropic  thermal  properties  arise  from  porosity  distribution  and  cell  wall  densities.  Thermal  conductivity  is  highest  in  the  longitudinal  direction  where the  cell cavities are open and the cell walls are continuous.  Suleiman et al (1999) attribute this to  the  fact  that  the  cellulose  in  the  cell  walls  is  arranged  in  microfibrils  that  are  aligned  with  the  longitudinal  axis  and  conduction  occurs  preferentially  along  the  microfibril  rather  than  across  it.  The  continuity  of  longitudinal  cell  and  pore  structures  promotes  thermal  conduction  and  potentially  convection  within  airfilled  pore  space.  When  viewed  in  transverse  and  radial  sections,  the  cell  pores  appear  as  discrete  air  pockets  that  function  as  insulators  to  inhibit  heat  transfer  in  the  transverse  and  radial directions.  

2.5.2 Influence of moisture content on thermal properties
The  microstructure  shown  in  Figure  26  illustrates  the  relationship  between  moisture  content  and  thermal  conduction.  As  moisture  content  increases,  the  fibres  of  the  cell  wall  swell  to  the  saturation  point.  The  microfibrils  that  comprise  cell  walls  can  contain  bound  water  up  to  ~28%  (by  weight)  on  average.  Above  28%  free  water  begins  to  appear  within  the  pore  space  where  it  is  transported  longitudinally  by  capillary  forces  as  it  fills  the  pores.  The  moisture  content  of  wood  is  related  to  the  thermal conductivity by the following equation developed by Wilkes (1979) from (ASHRAE, 2009):  

0.1791
   = Moisture content (%)

The cell wall thickening reduces the open pore size and its insulating effect. Greater crosssectional area  of the wall increases thermal conduction while the bound water increases the cell wall density.  

2.5.3 Influence of density on thermal properties
The  dry  density  of  wood  depends  on  the  cell  structure  and  its  porosity.  Wood  porosity  affects  heat  transfer  through  the  presence  of  air  or  moisture  within  the  cells  (Suleiman  et  al,  1999).  Research  21   

  conducted  by  Kollmann  (1951)  established  relationships  between  heat  flow  in  the  parallel  and  perpendicular  grain  directions  as  a  function  of  wood  density  at  27C  and  12%  MC.  For  thermal  conductivity in the longitudinal direction or parallel  k  to the grain, the kvalue is calculated as follows  (Sonderegger, 2009): 

k 0.026 0.46103

12 

For  thermal  conductivity  in  the  radial  direction  or  perpendicular  to  the  grain,  the  kvalue  is  calculated  using this relationship: 

k 0.026 0.195103

13 

On  average,  the  longitudinal  thermal  conductivity  is  greater  than  radial  thermal  conductivity  by  a  factor  of 1.8 over a reported range of 1.5 to 2.8 (Glass and Zelinka, 2010) for a variety of trees species.  

2.5.4 Influence of temperature on thermal properties
For  temperatures  between  20C  and  100C,  tests  indicate  that  thermal  conductivity  increases  approximately  14%  to  24%  for  the  longitudinal  and  transverse  axes  in  light  to  medium  hardwood.  However,  different  wood  samples  under  similar  temperature  conditions  exhibited  distinct  variations  in  their  thermal  conductivity  profile.  This  finding  further  suggests  that  the  wood  grain  type  and  its  orientation influence thermal conduction (Suleiman et al, 1999).  

2.6 Electrical properties of wood-based materials
The  conduction  of  electricity  occurs  only  in  materials  that  have  freely  moving  electron  charge  carriers.  Electrical  charge  can  be  carried  either  by  electrons  in  electronic  conduction  or  by  ions  in  ionic  conduction.  In  all  other  materials,  electric  fields  induce  polarization,  which  displaces  or  reorients  charged  particles  within  the  electric  field  (Keller  and  Frischknecht,  1966).  The  bond  strength  of  the  molecules within a medium and the field strength determine the extent of polarization.  In  metallic  conductors,  electrons  are  free  to  move  throughout  the  metal's  atomic  structure.  The  electrons  in  the  metallic  atom's  outer  shell  dissociate  and  move  easily  within  the  lattice  structure  of  the  material.  The  electrical  field  produced  by  an  applied  voltage  potential  drives  the  dissociated  electrons  from  the  high  electron  potential  terminal  (negative)  to  the  low  electron  potential  terminal  (positive).  This  type  of  current  flow  is  known  as  electronic  conduction.  Ionic  conduction  occurs  through  the  movement  of  ions  (charge  carriers)  through  the  molecular  structure  of  a  solid  or  through  ions  in  22   

  aqueous  solution.  In  ionic  conduction,  the  mobility  of  the  charge  carrier  is  directly  related  to  temperature  unlike  electronic  conduction  where  temperature  is  inversely  related  to  charge  carrier  mobility.   The  electrical  conductivity  of  woodbased  materials  depends  primarily  on  their  moisture  content.  Other  influencing factors include temperature, grain direction and the dielectric constant.  

2.6.1 Temperature
When moisture content levels are above 10%, the wood's electrical conductance doubles for every 10°C  increase  in  temperature.  This  relationship  indicates  that  ionic  conduction  is  involved  in  the  flow  of  electrons (James, rev. 1988)) as the mobility of the charge carriers increases with temperature.  

2.6.2 Moisture content
While  temperature  has  a  direct  influence  on  electrical  conductance,  temperature  has  an  inverse  effect  on  moisture  content  as  the  EMC  of  wood  strongly  depends  on  its  temperature.  Drying  wood  from  the  fibre saturation point down to near zero increases the electrical resistance of wood by a factor of 1010 or  higher. The resistivity of oven dry wood is in the order 1015 to 1016  m while wood at fibre saturation is  in  the  range  of  103  to  104   m  (Glass  and  Zelinka,  2010).  Logarithmic  plots  of  moisture  content  versus  electrical  resistance  have  a  linear  relationship  throughout  this  range.  Further,  above  the  FSP  up  to  the  capillary  saturation  point,  there  is  a  poor  relationship  between  MC  and  electrical  resistance.  In  this  region  (`D'  from  Figure  23),  drying  reduces  the  electrical  resistance  by  only  a  factor  of  50  to  100  over  a  narrow range of relative humidity (James, rev. 1988)).   The  reduced  influence  of  moisture  content  and  poorer  correlation  with  electrical  resistance  above  FSP  likely arises from the increased continuity of water within the pore structure. As the pore spaces fill with  fluid, the electrical conductance of the wood and moisture approach the limits of conduction in aqueous  solution. Above FSP, the dominant influence on electron flow is determined by the ionic potential of the  dissolved  mineral  content.  The  ionic  potential  may  also  be  related  to  the  water  solubility  of  the  extractive content within the wood.  

2.6.3 Dielectric constant
The  ability  of  a  material  to  polarize  and  establish  an  internal  electric  field  is  measured  by  its  dielectric  strength.  The  dielectric  strength  or  absolute  permittivity  is  determined  from  the  amount  of  charge  (Q)  per  volt  (Farad)  stored  by  the  material  over  the  charge  separation  distance.  The  dielectric  constant  is  a  23   

  relative  measure  of  the  material's  dielectric  strength  to  the  dielectric  strength  of  a  vacuum.  The  dielectric  constant  is  an  important  consideration  for  materials  like  wood  and  cellulose  insulation  that  have extremely receptive surface areas for the adsorption of polarized water molecules.   As  the  moisture  content  of  hygroscopic  materials  like  wood  and  cellulose  increase,  adsorption  advances  from  the  well  bonded,  single  molecular  layer  to  the  more  weakly  bonded,  multiple  molecular  layers.  It  follows that an applied voltage field will have an increased effect on the polarization of the more weakly  bonded  adsorbed  water  molecules  added  at  higher  relative  humidity.  Wood's  dielectric  strength  increases with increasing moisture content (James, rev. 1988)). 

2.6.4 Grain direction
Wood  fibres  with  adsorbed  water  molecules  conduct  current  through  ionic  conduction  and  polarization  while  the  open  pore  spaces  act  as  insulators  to  resist  the  flow  of  electricity.  Grain  direction  influences  conductivity the most along the grain in the longitudinal direction. Electrical conduction in the tangential  and radial directions is roughly half that of the longitudinal direction.  

2.7 Electrical resistance and moisture content
The  moisture  content  of  wood  and  woodbased  products  can  be  determined  using  electrical  resistance  measurements  and  mathematical  relationships  to  correct  for  wood  species  and  temperature.  Empirical  research by the forest products industry developed equations relating electrical conductivity to moisture  content. Douglas fir became the industry standard for moisture sensing equipment and most meters are  calibrated  to  Douglas  fir  at  21°C  (70°F).  Further  research  developed  the  mathematical  relationships 

Figure27Photoillustratingthepositioningofmoisturesensorpinsinframingplates

24   

  between the industry standard and various other wood species and wood products (Straube et al, 2002).  The  resistance  of  wood  cannot  be  measured  by  common  handheld  multimeters  since  the  resistance  of  wood  is  very high  in  typical  applications.  Specially  designed,  high  resistance,  handheld  moisture  meters  have  evolved  over  the  years  for  use  in  the  lumber  industry.  These  devices  are  calibrated  and  work  well  for  industry  applications.  For  insitu  measurements,  the  principals  of  the  handheld  moisture  sensor  have  been  adapted  for  use  with  a  datalogger.  The  datalogger  can  record  data  from  wired  sensor  pins  specially  placed  and  embedded  in  building  assemblies.  This  technique  is  nondestructive  and  relatively  noninvasive.  The  photo  in  Figure  27  illustrates  the  positioning  of  the  MC  sensor  pins  with  a  25.4  mm  separation, their signal wires and the associated thermistor (on left) for temperature measurements.  

2.7.1 Measurement circuit and corrections
The  measurement  circuit  is  configured  to  allow  the  datalogger  to  measure  changes  in  voltage  across  a  resistor  with  a  known  resistance  (10,000  ).  The  electrical  resistance  of  the  wood  between  the  MC  sensors  can  be  determined  from  this  measured  voltage  (Vsensor)  through  a  series  of  mathematical  relationships. 
Figure 28 Schematic drawing of the moisture sensor measurementcircuit

 The  measurement  circuit  is  a  series  circuit  consisting  of  a  power  supply,  the  MC  sensor 

and  a  known  sensor  resistor  as  shown  in  Figure  28.  The  datalogger  applies  12  V  potential  of  direct  current  across  the  circuit  and  measures  the  voltage  drop  across  the  sensor  resistor,  Vsensor.  The  voltage  measured across the 10k  sensor resistor wired in series with the pins. This measured voltage can then  be used in the voltage divider formula to calculate the electrical resistance of the wood at the MC sensor  pin location.    The voltage divider formula derived using Ohm's Law in Floyd (2010):

The total the sum of resistances in a series circuit can be determined from:

Rwood   = the resistance of the wood at the MC sensor pins () 

Equations 14 and 15 are combined to determine the resistance of the wood at the sensor pin location:

16 

The calculated value for Rwood can then be used to determine the uncorrected moisture content in terms  of Douglas fir with the following relationship (Straube et al, 2002): 

2.99­ 2.113   


 

17 

MCu   = uncorrected moisture content in terms of Douglas fir (%mass) 

Once  the  moisture  content  in  terms  of  Douglasfir  is  calculated,  the  MCu  value  can  be  corrected  for  temperature  and  species.  As  discussed  previously,  the  conductivity  wood  doubles  for  every  10°C  temperature change. Studies by Forintek Canada investigated the relationships of Canadian tree species,  temperature  and  correlation  to  Douglasfir.  These  studies  produced  correction  tables  and  developed  a  numerical  relationship  for  the  conversion  to  facilitate  the  correction  of  large  amounts  of  data.  The  relationship is as follows (Garrahan, 1988 and detailed in Straube et al, 2002):

MCc = corrected moisture content for species and temperature (%mass)  T  a, b  = wood temperature (°C)  = regression coefficients from species correction  

The  values  for  coefficients  `a'  and  `b'  are  species  dependent.  The  values  used  in  the  high  RSI  study  were  selected  from  a  table  of  coefficients  (Straube  et  al,  2002).  The  coefficients  for  Eastern  white  pine  /  Norway  spruce  were  used  to  correct  moisture  content  calculation  of  framing  lumber  (a  =  0.702  and  b=0.818).  The  coefficients  used  to  correct  the  OSB  MCdata  were  derived  by  laboratory  testing  performed by Forintek Canada, these values were a = 1.1114 and b = 0.366 (Straube et al, 2002).  26   

 

2.8 Air leakage
Air  tightness  in  buildings  is  essential  to  control  undesired  airflows  through  building  envelopes.  The  uncontrolled  movement  of  air  through  wall  assemblies  is  a  contributor  to  moisture  related  building  problems.  Air  leakage  introduces  damaging  moisture  that  promotes  the  growth  of  fungi  and  contributes  to  poor  indoor  air  quality.  Sufficiently  high  and  sustained  moisture  levels  in  wall  assemblies  lead  to  the  decay  of  structural wood framing components as well.  The  proper  design  and  installation  of  air  barriers  can  eliminate  the  damaging effects of air leakage.    Air  leakage  occurs  through  cracks  and  holes,  around  penetrations,  and  within  the  large  pore  spaces  of  some  insulating  materials,  as  shown  in  Figure  29.  Interior  and  exterior  air  can  mix  in  the  attic  space  (A)  and  leak  into  the wall cavities through gaps between the top plate and  the  drywall  as  well  as  any  electrical  wiring  holes  drilled  through  the  plates  (B).  In  buildings  without  an  intact  water  resistive  barrier  (WRB)  or  exterior  air  barrier,  air  leakage  can  enter  through  gaps  in  the  sheathing  shown  at  (C).  Interior  electrical  boxes  (D)  allow  air  to  circulate  into  the  wall  cavity.  Gaps  at  the  bottom  plate  with  the  drywall and subfloor (E) allow airflow across the wall into  the  wall  cavity.  Vents  and  other  penetrations  (F  &  G)  can  allow  interior  air  to  enter  the  wall  cavity  or  escape  directly  to  the  exterior.  If  penetrations  are  not  properly  sealed,  they  can  act  as  entry  points  for  rain  leakage  and  insects  as  well.  Other  connections  at  floor  headers  and  sill  plates  (H)  can  also  permit  airflow  across  wall  assemblies.

2.8.1 Air leakage mechanisms
The  air  pressure  differentials  that  drive  air  leakage  are  primarily  caused  by  wind,  stack  effect,  and  mechanical  air  handling  systems  (Hutcheon,  1983).  Unlike  ventilation,  air  leakage  is  uncontrolled,  which  means  that  it  is  not  filtered  or  conditioned  and  may  introduce  harmful  contaminants  or  allergens  to  the  indoor air. Uncontrolled airflows also transport problematic amounts of heat and moisture into sensitive  areas of the building enclosure.   Air  leakage  occurs  when  the  interstitial  air  of  framing  cavities  mixes  and  circulates  with  the  interior  or  exterior  air  through  upper  and  lower  openings  on  the  same  side  of  the  wall  assembly  (Hutcheon,  1983).  In  winter,  the  introduction  of  warm,  moist  interior  air  into  a  wall  cavity  creates  moisture  damage  as  the  air  mass  loses  heat  to  the  exterior  and  moisture  is  deposited  as  condensation  on  the  sheathing.  Air  leakage  from  outdoor  air  has  a  drying  effect  in  winter  as  the  cooler  winter  air  warms  within  the  assembly  and  removes  moisture.  In  summer,  outdoor  air  has  a  wetting  effect  warm,  humid  air  condenses  on  the  internal  vapour  barriers  of  airconditioned  spaces.  Air  leakage  reduces  energy  efficiency as it lowers the effective thermal resistance of air permeable insulation.   Warm  air  infiltrating  during  the  summer  and  exfiltrating  in  winter  has  the  potential  to  deposit  its  entrained  moisture  as  condensation  within  the  wall.  Conversely,  under  the  proper  conditions,  air  leakage can help to dry out a moisture laden wall assembly. The significant energy costs associated with  air  leakage  and  its  adverse  effects  on  thermal  comfort,  air  quality  and  wall  durability  have  driven  the  modern approach of limiting flow of air across an assembly to near zero (Straube, 2005).  Moderate  fluctuations  in  relative  humidity  and  the  moisture  content  in  envelope  assemblies  regularly  occur  as  the  envelope  equilibrates  with  changes  to  the  interior  and  exterior  climates.  As  moisture  loads  pass  through,  hygroscopic  materials  respond  by  adsorbing  or  desorbing  water  molecules  towards  their  EMC.  Air  leakage  can  carry  high  moisture  loads  that  disturb  the  moisture  balance  within  the  assembly.  Damage from excessive moisture occurs when the interstitial RH remains elevated for extended periods.  This damage can be compounded if the internal wall temperatures drop below the dew point.

2.8.2 Calculating airflows and leakage
The  flow  of  air  across  a  building  envelope  occurs  through  discrete  cracks  and  openings  as  shown  in  Figure  29.  The  airflow  can  be  characterized  as  orifice  flow,  large  crack  flow  or  small  crack  flow  (tortuous).  The  complexity  of  defining  the  size  and  distribution  of  each  crack  and  orifice  has  led  to  the  assumption  of  diffuse  flow  through  enclosure  components  (Straube,  2005).  Wholebuilding  air  leakage  tests  measure  the  combined  flow  rate  of  all  the  of  the  leak  types  in  the  building  under  a  specific  pressure differential. The general power law equation is used to fit these data (Baker et al, 1987):            Q  = volumetric flow rate  P  C  = pressure (Pa)  = flow coefficient   19 

n  = flow exponent (0.5 < n < 1.0) 

To determine the flow rate at different pressures for the same test, the conversion is as follows:     
 

 

20  

 

The  value  of  the  flow  exponent  helps  to  indicate  the  dominant  type  of  airflow  through  the  enclosure.  Lower  flow  exponent  values  (~0.5)  indicate  turbulent  flow  while  exponent  values  of  1  indicate  that  the  flow is laminar and the flow rate is linearly related to the change in pressure.  

2.8.3 Air leakage flow rates and standards
As  building  codes  raise  the  requirements  of  thermal  resistance  in  building  envelopes,  limited  progress  has  been  made  in  creating  mandatory  airtightness  testing  in  housing  and  currently  airtightness  requirements  do  not  exist  for  multiunit  residential  buildings  (MURBs)  (RDH,  2013).  Building  codes  like  the  2010  National  Building  Code  (NRC  IRC,  2010)  and  the  2011  National  Energy  Code  of  Canada  for  Buildings  (NRC IRC, 2011)  or the 2006 OBC (OMMAH, 2006) and  its 2012 Supplementary Standard SB12  (OMMAH,  2011)  all  specify  the  required  properties  for  air  barrier  materials  as  well  as  continuity  details.  According  to  these  codes  the  air  barrier  must  have  an  air  permeability  of  less  than  0.02  L/sm2  as  tested  according  to  CAN/ULCS742,  "Air  Barrier  Assemblies  ­  Specification,"  (SCC,  2011)  under  a  pressure  differential of 75 Pa. These building codes also supply details regarding the condition and integrity of the  air barrier as well as requirements to ensure the proper sealing of edges and connections with adjoining  29   

  materials;  they  do  not,  however,  specify  any  required  test  to  ensure  compliance  and  determine  the  actual  air  leakage  of  the  building  (RDH,  2013).  Such  a  requirement  would  be  analogous  to  the  pressure  testing plumbing or natural gas lines prior to use.   The  United  States  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  mandate  air  leakage  tests  for  their  newly  commissioned  buildings  to  ensure  compliance  with  construction  standards.  USACE  consistently  achieve  air  leakage  rates  of  1.27  L/sm2  of  enclosure  area  at  75  Pa  because  of  testing  procedures  and  performance  standards  (RDH,  2013).  In  contrast,  selected  typical  mean  NLR75  air  leakage  data  for  selected Canadian building types (CMHC, 2001) is summarized as follows:       MultiUnit Residential Building (MURB) ­ 3.19 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  Office Buildings ­ 2.48 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  Schools ­ 1.48 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  Commercial ­ 1.35 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  Institutional ­ 0.86 L/sm2@ 75 Pa 

All aspects of residential housing from single detached to multiunit residential buildings (MURBs) would  benefit from mandatory wholebuilding air tightness standards. Air leakage limits and testing would give  industry  targets  and  the  impetus  for  compliance.  The  resulting  improved  energy  efficiency  and  lower  upfront  costs  from  smaller  heating,  ventilation  and  air  conditioning  (HVAC)  systems  would  serve  to  offset  increased  expenditures  associated  with  the  evaluation  of  building  air  tightness.  Improved  air  quality and thermal comfort could be considered a bonus. 

2.8.4 Air leakage units of measurement
Wholebuilding  airtightness  is  expressed  differently  throughout  the  building  industry.  The  units  of  measurement  include  the  airflow  or  leakage  rate  and  a  specified  pressure  differential  that  is  often  related  to  the  volume  or  surface  area  of  the  building.  As  summarized  in  Finch,  Straube  and  Genge,  (2009) airleakage test results are reported as:     Fan flow rate (L/s, cfm) required to establish a specific pressure drop (50, 75 Pa)  Equivalent leakage area (ELA) that results from a specific flow rate and pressure differential    Air exchange rate (ACH, m3/hr//m3) at a specified pressure differential   

Reporting  test  data  as  an  ELA  combines  all  of  the  openings  that  contributed  to  the  leakage  and  summarizes  them  as  an  equivalent  rectangular  opening  that  can  be  readily  compared  between 

30   

  buildings.  Test  data  reported  as  an  air  exchange  rate  are  normalized  to  the  building  volume  (ACH),  floor  area  or  total  envelope  area.  The  National  Research  Council  of  Canada  (NRC)  uses  the  Normalized  Leakage  Rate  (NLR)  to  quantify  air  leakage  in  buildings.  The  standard  NLR75  is  defined  as  the  total  air  leakage divided by the total envelope area using an indoor to outdoor pressure differential of 75 Pa.  Airtightness  standards  and  methods  to  achieve  low  air  leakage  rates  are  constantly  evolving.  As  previously  discussed,  building  codes  outline  materials  and  requirements  for  air  barriers  but  they  do  not  establish  a  desired  degree  of  overall  building  airtightness.  Some  organizations  have  developed  air tightness  targets  for  buildings  and  the  following  are  some  examples  of  equivalent  normalized  leakage  rates (ASHRAE, 2009):         ASHRAE ­ Tight enclosure = 0.5 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  ASHRAE ­ Average enclosure = 1.5 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  ASHRAE ­ Leaky enclosure = 3.1 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  Int'l Energy Conservation Code (IEEC) = 2.0 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  NBC 2005 for building assemblies (curtain wall) = 0.15 L/sm2@ 75 Pa  Air  Tightness  Testing  and  Measurement  Association  (ATTMA  2007)  =  0.83  L/sm2@  50  Pa  for  best practice construction of dwelling enclosures.    Common  reference  pressure  differentials  for  airtightness  testing  are  4,  10,  25,  50  and  75  Pa.  The  pressure  differences  closest  to  those  actually  experienced  across  building  envelopes  are  in  the  range  of  4  to  10  Pa.  While  the  leakage  data  at  low  pressures  may  be  more  representative  of  actual  conditions,  achieving  repeatable  leakage  test  data  at  these  low  pressures  is  not  feasible  at  this  time.  Differences  in  test  method  or  technique  as  well  as  small  calibration  errors  result  in  larger  errors  when  the  data  are  extrapolated to 4 Pa (ASHRAE, 2009).  

2.9 Mould and decay
The  assessment  criteria  for  moisture  related  damage  are  determined  by  the  amount  of  time  moisture  sensitive  building  materials  are  exposed  to  elevated  RH  levels  or  liquid  moisture.  The  consequences  of  excessive  moisture  accumulation  and  retention  are  well  known  ­  corrosion  of  fasteners,  bacterial  growth, mould and staining, decay fungi and the favourable conditions for insects, but the boundaries of  the  limiting  conditions  as  less  well  understood.  Nofal  and  Morris  (2003)  discussed  the  need  for  a  damage  function  to  integrate  with  hygrothermal  models  in  order  to  facilitate  the  prediction  of  strength  31   

  degradation  associated  with  decay.  The  authors  proposed  that  damage  be  considered  in  terms  of  a  loss  of  strength  to  the  assembly  as  well  as  the  potentially  hazardous  effects  of  biological  damage  on  the  health of the occupants.   Fungi  are  some  of  the  earliest  organisms  on  earth  and  their  spores  can  be  found  virtually  everywhere.  Over  a  million  species  of  fungi  exist  on  the  planet  and  they  grow  under  a  variety  of  conditions.  Some  species  are  hazardous  to  human  health  and  destructive  to  building  assemblies.  Fungi  require  oxygen,  moisture  and  favourable  temperatures  to  multiply.  When  all  of  these  conditions  are  met,  they  are  capable  of  decomposing  organic  material  such  as  paper,  adhesives,  wood,  and  cellulose.  The  rate  of  fungal  growth  depends  on  surface  area  and  access  to  nutrients.  High  surface  area  materials  like  particleboard,  fibreboard,  ceiling  tiles  and  paper  facings  have  the  highest  growth  rates.  Woodbased  products  like  lumber,  plywood  and  OSB  have  slower  growth  rates  but  can  be  significant  under  the  right  conditions.   Since  fungal  spores  are  ubiquitous,  it  is  most  likely  that  they  are  built  into  enclosure  assemblies.  Kiln  dying  lumber  is  an  improvement  over  airdrying  in  that  it  eliminates  any  spores  that  may  be  present  at  the  time  of  drying.  Air  dried  lumber  was  often  infected  with  fungal  spores,  and  if  not  spaced  properly,  could  initiate  the  decay  process  prior  to  drying.  Storage,  transportation  and  installation  of  lumber  products  also  yield  opportunities  for  contamination  by  fungal  spores.  Even  once  the  building  enclosure  is completed, rainwater and air leakage can introduce more spores as well as the moisture to help them  grow.   The  proliferation  of  decay  related  organisms  is  complex  process.  The  establishment  of  woodrotting  basidiomycetes  is  a  function  of  the  aforementioned  growth  requirements  as  well  as  competition  from  bacteria, moulds, and staining fungi that are effective at colonizing wet wood as well. The decay process  can,  however,  be  simplified  to  the  three  stages  of  establishment,  growth  and  decay,  and  survival.  Since  these  stages  can  be  limited  by  controlling  humidity  and  temperature,  establishing  boundary  conditions  for these parameters will help hygrothermal models more effectively predict enclosure durability.  

2.9.1 Thresholds
Defining  thresholds  for  mould  growth  and  decay  processes  require  limiting  conditions  for  the  relative  humidity and temperature of the internal wall environment. The ideal temperature conditions for mould  growth  are  species  dependent  but  the  average  range  is  from  20°  to  35°  C.  Fungal  growth  slows  outside  of  this  range  and  generally  stops  below  5°C  and  above  50°C.  The  fungal  spores  can  survive  outside  of  32   

  this  range  so  growth  can  resume  when  favourable  conditions  return.  Most  fungal  species  that  attack  building  materials  require  a  surface  RH  of  7580%  for  slow  growth  and  9095%  for  fast  growth.  Above  95%, fungal growth slows as oxygen is depleted within the pore space (Straube, 2005).   For  decay  related  damage,  there  is  consensus  that  maintaining  wood  below  20%  MC  provides  a  good  margin  of  safety  against  fungus  damage  (ASHRAE,  2009;  ).  Using  Equation  9  for  EMC,  prolonged  periods  at  90%  RH  translate  into  2021%  EMC  for  most  species  of  wood  between  5°C  and  30°C.  At  95%  RH,  the  EMC  of  wood  averages  24%  between  5°C  and  30°C.  The  EMC  for  OSB  is  approximately  34%  lower  than  that  of  wood  (Straube  et  al,  2002)  under  similar  conditions.  The  physical  factors  that  reduce  the  moisture  content  of  OSB  could  also  limit  mould  growth.  These  factors  include  the  wax  and  adhesives  used  to  bind  the  strands  together,  as  well  as  the  smooth,  compacted  interior  face  of  the  sheathing  that  minimizes  the  amount  of  surface  area  available  for  growth  to  occur.  The  higher  density  of  OSB  also  lowers  the  porosity  of  the  material,  which  removes  some  of  the  air  from  within  the  wood's  structure  as  well as potential storage for the adsorbed and absorbed moisture that enables mould growth.   The  rate  of  decay  depends  on  the  fungus  and  tree  species  as  well  as  whether  or  not  it  is  heartwood  or  sapwood. The generally accepted onset point where active decay begins is above 2628% MC (at or near  the  fibre  saturation  point)  although  it  has  been  shown  that  marginal  infection  can  also  occur  as  low  as  25%  MC  (Morris  and  Winandy,  2002).  Further,  Morris  and  Winandy  (2002)  also  reported  that  Forintek  confirmed  that  OSB  decay  could  be  initiated  at  27%  MC  when  exposed  to  99.9%  RH  and  20°C  for  8.5  months  and  inoculation  every  2  weeks.  Once  decay  is  initiated  above  the  2628%  threshold,  decay  will  continue down to 20% MC before ceasing.

3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
To  investigate  the  risks  associated  with  reduced  drying  capacity,  thirteen  test  panels  were  built  and  inserted  into  the  exterior  walls  of  the  University  of  Waterloo's  Building  Engineering  Group  test  facility  (BEG  Hut)  in  Waterloo,  Ontario,  Canada.  Construction  and  installation  details  are  provided  in  Appendix  A. 

3.1 Building Engineering Group test facility
The  thirteen  test  panels  include  five  high  RSI  value  wall  assemblies  built  with  north  (N)  and  south  (S)  facing  orientations;  one  high  RSI  value  wall  assembly  built  on  a  south  facing  orientation  only  and  one  datum  wall  assembly  built  with  both  north  and  south  facing  orientations.  The  datum  wall  assembly  was  a currently codeaccepted wall design that met the OBC 2012 minimum for thermal resistance.  The  BEG  Hut  test  facility  had  space  for  seven  south  facing  test  panels  and  only  six  north  facing  test  panels.  For  this  reason,  wall  Type  4  was selected for southern exposure only. Figure  31 shows the north and south elevations of the  BEG  Hut  and  the  placement  of  the  13  test  panels.  The  test  panels  were  numbered  from  the  east  on  both  the  north  and  south  elevations.   The  BEG  Hut  test  facility  is  a  10.5  m  square  building  with  each  of  its  exterior  walls  aligned  with  one  of  the  four  principal  directions.  The  building  has  a  3.0  m  floor  to  ceiling  height  with  a  1:3  pitch  hip  roof.  The  post  and  beam  construction maximizes the wall space available  for test panels.  A  pipe  mast  is  anchored  to  the  roof  that

supports  the  weather  station  10  m  above 

34   

  grade.  The  BEG  Hut  is  conditioned  with  an  airtoair  heat  pump,  humidification  system  and  four  ceiling  fans  to  maintain  a  uniform  temperature  of  21°  and  40%  relative  humidity  throughout  the  building.  The  200  mm  roof  overhang  was  designed  to  prevent  shading  and  incorporates  a  dripedge  in  lieu  of  eavestrough to optimize exposure.   The  building  is  located  on  flat  land  adjacent  to  a  university  parking  lot.  The  base  of  the  test  panels  are  between  160  and  220  mm  above  grade  with  the  exterior  siding  lapping  over  the  builtup  wall  curb  at  the edge of the BEG Hut floor slab. 

3.1.1 BEG Hut weather data instrumentation
The  weather  station  installed  at  the  BEG  Hut  facility  collected  the  ambient  exterior  temperature,  wind  speed  and  direction,  as  well  as  relative  humidity  data  from  a  height  of  10  m  above  grade.  Incident  solar  radiation was measured with a pyranometer that was located lower on the instrumentation mast at roof  height (shown in Figure 31) with the tippingbucket rain gauge.  Weather  data  from  the  nearby  Environment  Canada    University  of  Waterloo  Class  A  weather  station  was  available  for  substitution  in  the  instance  that  weather  data  was  not  collected  at  the  BEG  Hut  weather station. 

3.1.2 Wall type identification
The  seven  wall  assemblies  were  identified  by  their  type  and  orientation.  Their  locations  in  the  BEG  Hut  exterior are shown in Figure 31. The deep cavity walls and the datum wall were designated as follows:      Type 1 (S1, N1) ­ Double Stud with densepacked cellulose  Type 2 (S2, N2) ­ IJoist Stud with densepacked cellulose  Type 3 (S3, N3) ­ 38x140 mm Datum with fibreglass cavity insulation  Type 4 (S4) ­ 38x184 mm (Spray Foam) 

The  remaining  three  wall  types  were  constructed  using  the  base  Type  3  Datum  framing  and  configured  with three different types of exterior insulation. These three wall assemblies were identified as:     Type 5 (S5, N5) ­ 38x140 mm with 50 mm (RSI 2.18) Polyisocyanurate  Type 6 (S6, N6) ­ 38x140 mm 64 mm (RSI 2.21) Extruded Polystyrene  Type 7 (S7, N7) ­ 38x140 mm 76 mm (RSI 2.11) Mineral Wool 

35   

  The installed thickness of each exterior insulation type was chosen to result in approximately equivalent  RSI  values  of  RSI  2.2,  2.2  and  2.1,  respectively.  Detailed  construction  drawings  of  the  test  panels  are  provided in Appendix B. 

3.2 Test panel installation and isolation.
The  rough  openings  of  the  BEG  Hut  were  finished  with  38  mm  XPS  insulation,  12.5  mm  plywood  and  wrapped  with  selfadhering  water  proof  membrane  on  the  exterior  edge.  The  plywood  was  fastened  to  the  building  posts,  beams  or  floor  curb  through  the  insulation.  The  plan  view  diagram  in  Figure  32  illustrates how the test panels were inserted into BEG Hut walls, hygrothermally isolated and sealed.  

Figure32HygrothermalisolationofthetestpanelsintheexteriorwallsoftheBEGHut(typical).

The  test  panels  were  hygrothermally  isolated  using  305  mm  IJoists  placed  vertically  between  the  test  panels. Each IJoist web was filled with 12.5 mm  thick XPS insulation to make  the side of the  IJoist flush  with the edge of the flange. Waterproof membrane was then wrapped around the exterior edge of the I Joist. The openings were sized to allow for a 19 to 25 mm space around each test panel to accommodate  the  sensor  wires  and  tubing  as  well  as  provide  adequate  space  for  the  foam  to  penetrate  the  gap  and  make an airtight seal. 

3.3 Test panel design
The  test  panels  were  designed  with  the  overall  dimensions  of  1.22  x  2.44  m  and  were  framed  on  600  mm  centres  with  double  top  plates.  The  framing  is  predominantly  38  mm  thick  spruce  lumber  with  varying  widths  depending  on  the  wall  design.  Table  31  summarizes  the  framing,  insulation  type  with  36   

  cavity  RSI  value  and  vapour  control  details.  The  basic  design  of  the  test  panel  includes  three  cavities  ­  the  central  571.5  mm  wide  cavity  and  the  two  277  mm  side  cavities.  The  side  cavities  were  designed  as  hygrothermal buffers for the central cavity. To this end, the two outermost studs were framed using 9.5  mm  spruce  plywood  in  order  to  maintain  proportional  thermal  performance.  The  RSI  values  shown  for  each  wall  represent  the  "Installed  Insulation  RSI",  which  is  the  sum  of  the  insulation  product  RSI  values  as  defined  by  Christian  and  Kosny,  (1995).  The  installed  insulation  value  is  generally  cited  by  building  codes  and  used  by  industry  participants.  The  RSI  values  presented  in  Table  31  do  not  reflect  the  effects  of  thermal  bridging.  The  thermal  analysis  of  the  centreofcavity  and  clear  wall  RSIvalues  is  presented  with the heat flux data in Section 4.8.

The Type 2 wall used 241 mm IJoists in lieu of solid spruce lumber to isolate the three stud cavities. The  IJoists  were  built  onsite  using  an  11  mm  oriented  strand  board  (OSB)  web  and  38x64  mm  SPF  flanges.  The  IJoist  webs  were  connected  to  the  flanges  via  11x12.5  mm  dadoes,  fastened  with  construction  adhesive  and  clamped  overnight  to  ensure  good  adhesion.  The  Type  1  double  stud  wall,  by  nature  of  its  design, was the only wall where the central cavity was connected to the side cavities through the 57 mm  insulated space (thermal break) between the interior and exterior frames.   The  general  framing  elevation  diagram  for  all  of  the  wall  assemblies  is  located  in  Figure  33.  This  figure  shows  the  layout  of  the  central  stud  cavity  and  indicates  the  dimensions  as  well  as  the  locations  of  sensors,  the  exterior  wetting  sheet  and  the  air  injection  /  exhaust  ports.  For  detailed  diagrams,  please  refer to Appendix B.     37

The  exploded  cross  section  shown  in  Figure  34  on  the  preceding  page  illustrates  the  installed  sensor  locations  relative  to  each  wall  layer.  Wall  components  are  identified  alphabetically  and  listed  in  Table  32. The instrumentation and monitoring details are located in Section 3.6. 

3.4 Test panel control components
In  addition  to  the  building  controls  and  side  cavity  buffer  zones,  each  wall  assembly  was  designed  to  hygrothermally  isolate  the  central  stud  cavity  using  common  control  layers.  The  control  layers  common  to each assembly were:      Exterior drainedscreened wall system   11 mm OSB sheathing   Interior 12.5 mm drywall with   Two coats of latex paint  

These  common  components  limited  the  factors  affecting  hygrothermal  performance  and  facilitated  comparisons between the high RSI walls and the Type 3 datum.  

3.4.1 Drained-screened exterior assembly
The  drainedscreened  exterior  was  assembled  with  8  mm  fibre  cement  siding,  19  mm  strapping  /  air  layer (drainage space) and drainage plane.   40   

  The drainage plane or water resistive barrier (WRB)  was provided by the spun  bonded polyolefin (SBPO)  installed  on  the  exterior  side  of  the  OSB  sheathing.  A  slightly  oversized  1.2  x  2.4  m  sheet  of  SBPO  was  sealed  to  the  waterproof  membrane  on  the  finished  wall  openings  with  construction  tape.  Penetrations  in this layer for sensor wires were sealed with acoustical sealant and tape. The air space around the test  panel was filled with polyurethane foam (window grade) to complete the air, water and thermal sealing.  The  exterior  insulation  used  in  Wall  Types  5  and  6  provided  an  additional  drainage  plane  in  these  walls.  The exterior mineral wool insulation of Wall Type 7 increased the drainage space from 19 mm to 57 mm.  

3.4.2 Exterior insulation
Walls  should  have  at  least  one  direction  of  drying  provided  to  deal  with  accidental  and  construction  moisture.  In  the  walls  with  extruded  polystyrene  (permeance  of  18  ng/Pasm2  at  64  mm  thickness)  and  foilfaced polyisocyanurate (permeance less than 1 ng/Pasm2 due to the aluminium facer material), the  interior 6mil polyethylene was removed to allow a drying path to the inside.  The mineral wool exterior insulation used in wall Type 7 had a high water vapour permeance in excess of  the  OBC  minimum  requirement  for  water  vapour  control.  The  6mil  polyethylene  vapour  retarder  was  located between the stud cavity and the interior drywall in wall type 7.  

3.4.3 Air barrier
Several of the materials used in the various test panels will perform the function of an air barrier as well  as the SBPO layer, but this air barrier and its location are common to each wall type. For the purposes of  the  air  injection  test,  further  air  sealing  was  provided  for  the  central  stud  cavity.  Acoustical  sealant  was  applied  around  the  air  injection  port  to  provide  an  air  seal  between  the  6mil  polyethylene  and  drywall.  Where  6mil  polyethylene  was  not  used  for  vapour  control,  acoustical  sealant  was  applied  around  the  perimeter  of  the  drywall  to  ensure  that  the  injected  test  air  exited  the  cavity  from  the  25  mm  diameter  exhaust port drilled into the centre of the top plates. 

3.4.4 OSB sheathing
The  11.1  mm  OSB  sheathing  was  installed  in  two  pieces  with  the  horizontal  joint  600  mm  above  the  bottom  plate.  Since  the  OSB  sheathing  is  moisture  sensitive,  its  moisture  content  was  the  primary  performance  indicator.  Changes  in  OSB  MC  were  monitored  to  determine  the  effects  of  climatic  exposure and the air injection test in order to determine the drying potential and durability of each wall  assembly.  To  monitor  moisture  content,  the  sheathing  was  instrumented  with  temperature  and  41   

  moisture  sensors  as  shown  in  Figure  33  and  Figure  34  as  well  as  the  more  detailed  construction  drawings in Appendix B.  

3.5 Cavity insulation 
There are three types of cavity insulation used in this study:      Fibreglass batt  Closed cell Polyurethane Spray Foam (ccSPF)  Densepack cellulose 

The  fibreglass  batt  insulation  was  installed  in  the  stud  cavities  the  38x140mm  framed  walls.  It  is  a  very  common  insulating  material  in  North  American  residential  construction  because  it  does  not  require  any  specialized installation knowledge. In contrast, the ccSPF insulation used in wall Type 4 must be installed  professionally as it requires special equipment and experience.   The  ccSPF  installation  required  three  applications  each  separated  by  a  cooling  period  to  obtain  the  required  152  mm  thickness.  The  foam  cured  through  an  exothermic  reaction  that  caused  the  temperature  in  the  stud  cavity  to  rise  above  65°  C  on  an  average  hourly  basis,  while  the  peak  temperature  on  a  15minute  basis  reached  a  high  of  75°C.  Figure  35  shows  the  change  in  OSB  and  S4  central  cavity  temperatures  before,  during  and  after  the  installation  of  the  ccSPF  insulation.  Prior  to  the  installation,  the  cavity  and  OSB  were  exposed  to  the  interior  climate,  which  resulted  in  the  stable 

Figure35OSBandcavitytemperaturesinS4associatedwithccSPFinstallation

  temperatures  prior  to  November  15.  After  the  foam  installation,  daily  temperature  fluctuations  can  be  observed.   The final type of cavity insulation used in this study  was densepack cellulose insulation. Blown cellulose  insulation is most often used in attic type spaces where settling is not a major concern. However, in wall  applications,  the  cellulose  must  be  installed  with  sufficient  density  to  resist  settling,  as  any  compaction  post installation will result in a loss of thermal protection in the upper portion of the stud cavity.  

3.5.1 Cellulose installation procedure
The  densepack  cellulose  insulation  was  installed  using  industry  best  practices  under  the  instruction  of  Chris  Schumacher  at  Building  Science  Labs.  The  installation  of  the  cellulose  used  a  standard  hopper  and  blower  apparatus  and  the  only  specialized  equipment  required  was  a  38  mm  tapered  hose  adapter  to  reduce  the  100  mm  diameter  main  hose.  The  cellulose  was  installed  in  the  following  order  ­  S2,  S1,  N1,  and N2.   The insulation was installed with final average densities of 64 kg/m3 in the Type 1 double stud walls and  68  kg/m3  in  the  Type  2  IJoist  walls.  The  cellulose  was  easier  to  pack  into  the  separated  stud  cavities  of  the  IJoist  wall  as  the  lateral  connection  between  the  side  and  central  stud  cavities  of  the  double  stud  wall  allowed  air  to  circulate  through  all  of  the  stud  cavities,  which  made  compaction  more  difficult.  The  installed cellulose densities are located in Table 33.

Prior  to  installation,  the  rough  framed  test  panels  were  prepared  with  250  mm  wide  strips  of  6mil  polyethylene  sealed  to  the  outer  edges  of  each  assembly.  These  strips  were  used  to  attach  and  sealing  the  final  sheet  of  6mil  poly  vapour  barrier.  A  1.22  x  2.44  m  piece  of  air  permeable  fabric  was  then  installed  across  the  entire  face  of  the  test  panel  to  hold  the  cellulose  in  position  and  allow  the  air  to 

43   

  escape. Next, the face of the test panel was  strapped  horizontally  with  19  x  64  mm  spruce  on  400  mm  vertical  centres  to  support  the  fabric  and  ensure  a  planar  surface for the drywall.  The  cellulose  insulation  was  weighed  and  blown  into  the  walls  through  75  mm  `X'  slots  cut  into  the  air  permeable  fabric.  The  installation  proceeded  in  800  mm  vertical  increments  so  the  installed  insulation  mass  could  be  tracked  with  an  incremental  wall  volume. This stepwise process ensured that  the  desired  insulation  density  was  achieved.  Following  installation,  the  access  holes  were  sealed  with  construction  tape;  the  250  mm  polyethylene  strips  were  folded  around  the  strapping  and  sealed  to  the  final  sheet  of  6mil  polyethylene.  The  exterior  perimeter  of  the  polyethylene  was  packed  with  acoustical  sealant  to  prevent  the  edges  and  corners  of  the  strapping

from piercing the vapour retarder.   Figure  36  shows  the  S2  test  wall  after  the 

installation  of  the  cellulose.  The  fabric  is  visibly  stretched  from  the  packed  cellulose  but  held  in  place  well by the strapping. The access holes in the fabric were sealed with technical tape upon completion.  

3.6 Instrumentation and monitoring
The  centralized  data  acquisition  unit  (DAU)  installed  at  the  BEG  Hut  was  configured  with  five  Campbell  Scientific  AM1632B  multiplexers  (MUX),  a  main  CR  1000  data  logger  and  a  12  volt  backup  battery.  In  total,  220  sensors  were  used  to  monitor  the  13  test  panels  in  this  study  ­  121  Tsensors,  65  moisture 

44   

  sensors,  26  relative  humidity  sensors  and  8  heat  flux  transducers.  Each  test  panel  had  9  temperature,  2  relative humidity and 45 moisture content sensors installed (as detailed in Appendix B).   All  sensors  were  connected  to  the  DAU  with  CAT  3  communications  cables  from  terminal  strips  located  beside  each  test  panel.  The  datalogger  was  programmed  to  acquire  hourly  averaged  data  with  sample  intervals  at  15  minutes.  Detailed  MUX  wiring  diagrams  are  located  in  Appendix  C.  The  sensor  code  and  wiring  diagrams  are  located  in  Appendix  D.  The  datalogger  program  is  presented  in  Appendix  E.  The  datalogger  program  was  created  using  subroutines  authored  by  Chris  Schumacher  of  Building  Science  Corporation.  The  subroutines  are  noted  with  `CJS'  in  the  remark  statements  associated  with  each  subroutine.  

3.6.1 Exterior climate sensors
The  BEG  Hut  weather  station  uses  a  VaisalaTM  HUMICAP®  HMP  35C  to  measure  relative  humidity  and  temperature.  The  HMP  35C  probe  is  shielded  from  both  scattered  and  direct  solar  radiation  as  well  as  precipitation.  The  HMP  35C  relative  humidity  sensor  has  a  measuring  range  from  0.8  to  100%  RH  (0.002  to  1  VDC)  and  an  accuracy  at  +20°C  of  ±  2%  RH  (0  to  90%  RH)  and   ±  3%  RH  (90  to  100%  RH).  The  long term  stability  is  typically  <1%  RH  /  year  and  the  temperature  dependence  sensor  is  ±  0.04%  RH/°C.  For  temperature, the HMP 35C uses a platinum Pt 100 RTD (IEC751 1/3 Class B) with a resistance of 100  at  0°C  and  a  measurement  range  from  40°  to  +60°C  (0  to  1  V  DC).  The  overall  accuracy  of  this  sensor  through the range of 24°C to 48°C is ±0.4°C.   Incident  solar  radiation  is  monitored  using  a  Kipp  &  Zonen  Model  CM11  pyranometer.  The  accuracy  of  the  pyranometer  is  ±  10  W/m2  with  a  sensitivity  to  temperature  dependence  of  <1%  from  10°C  to  +40°C.  Pyranometers  measure  total  radiation,  direct  and  diffuse,  independent  of  wavelength  and  angle  of incidence. The BEG Hut pyranometer is mounted in an unobstructed, horizontal position.   Wind  speed  and  direction  is  monitored  using  the  RM  Young  Wind  Sentry  0300210A.  The  anemometer  has  an  operating  range  of  0  to  50  m/s  with  an  accuracy  of  ±  0.5  m/s.  The  output  frequency  is  0.75  m/s  per Hz. The balanced wind direction vane uses a 10k  transducer that operates with 1% linearity and an  accuracy of ± 5°. Precipitation is measured with a 0.1 mm/count tipping bucket rain gauge. 

3.6.2 Relative humidity sensors
The  relative  humidity  (RH)  sensors  used  in  this  study  were  Honeywell  model  HIH3610004  series.  Each  RH sensor was bundled with a Tsensor and wrapped with spunbonded polyolefin for protection against  45   

  liquid  water.  These  sensor  bundles  were  mounted  middepth  in  both  the  central  stud  cavity  and  the  exterior  drainage  space,  as  shown  in  Figure  34.  They  were  secured  with  nylon  line  and  building  tape  to  maintain their positioning while the insulation was installed.   The  HIH3610  sensors  have  an  accuracy  of  ±2%  RH  from  0  to  100%RH  under  noncondensing  conditions  while exposure to 90%RH with condensing conditions causes a reversible shift of ±3% RH. Placement of  the  RH  sensors  in  the  centre  of  the  insulation  cavity  limited  the  sensors  exposure  to  >90%RH.  The  interchangeability  accuracy  of  these  sensors  is  ±5%RH,  060%RH  and  ±8%  @  90%RH  with  other  performance details as follows:       RH Linearity ­ ±0.5% RH typical  RH Hysteresis ­ ±1.2% span maximum  RH Repeatability ­ ±0.5%RH  RH Stability ­ ±1% RH typical at 50% RH in 5 years  Vsupply = 5 V DC 

The  sensor  RH  data  was  processed  to  correct  for  temperature  using  the  temperature  compensation  equation (T in °C):  TrueRH=(SensorRH)/(1.05460.00216T) [21] 

The effect of this temperature correction is ±0.007%RH/°C at 0%RH and 0.22%RH/°C at 100%RH.  

3.6.3 Temperature sensors
The  temperature  sensors  used  in  this  study  were  precision  Fenwal  Unicurve®  10k   (25°C)  thermistors  wired  in  series  with  a  1000    fixed  resistor.  Temperature  was  calculated  from  the  voltage  difference  measured across the fixed resistor using the following relationship (R in ):  T=0.101R3+4.346R2­77.18R+446.05 [22] 

Each  Tsensor  had  a  tolerance  of  ±0.2°C  and  operated  with  a  supply  voltage  of  2.5  V.  These  Tsensors  were  installed  with  each  relative  humidity,  moisture  content,  and  heat  flux  sensor  as  well  as  on  the  interior  and  exterior  surfaces  of  the  assemblies.  The  thermistor  measurement  circuit  is  detailed  in  Appendix F.

3.6.4 Wood moisture
The  moisture  content  (MC)  sensor  pins  were  installed  to  a  depth  of  5  mm  in  the  OSB  sheathing  and  framing.  The  MC  sensors  installed  in  the  plates  were  9.5  mm  from  the  exterior  edge  of  the  framing.  The  sensors were located at elevations of 285, 1200 and 2040 mm along the vertical centreline of the central  cavity as measured from the top of the bottom plate as shown in Figure 33 and Figure 34  The  electrical  resistance  of  the  wood  between  the  MC  sensor  pins  was  determined  from  the  voltage  measured  across  a  10k    resistor  in  series  using  Ohm's  law  and  the  voltage  divider.  This  electrical  resistance  was  then  used  to  calculate  the  moisture  content  based  on  the  mathematical  relationships  between species and temperature, as detailed in Section 2.7.1. 

3.6.5 Interior climate sensors
The  interior  climate  was  monitored  for  temperature  and  relative  humidity  using  an  RH/T  bundle  similar  to  those  used  within  the  test  panel  assemblies.  The  sensors  were  centrally  located  at  a  height  of  1.8  m  above the floor and recorded with the CR1000 DAU.  

3.6.6 Heat flux
Two heat flux (HF) transducers were installed on four south facing walls each to measure the variation in  heat  flux  through  the  insulation  cavity  and  the  stud.  These  sensors  were  installed  on  the  cavity  side  of  the  drywall  to  limit  the  effects  of  air  movement  on  the  sensor  output.  A  shallow  notch  the  thickness  of  the  transducer  (3  mm)  was  cut  into  the  stud  to  allow  the  heat  flux  sensor  to  lie  flush  with  the  stud  face  and  not  interfere  with  the  placement  of  the  drywall.  Temperature  sensors  were  installed  directly  over  the  heat  flux  transducers  on  the  interior  surface  of  the  drywall  at  both  the  cavity  centre  and  stud  locations. Heat flux transducers were installed on S2, S3, S4 and S5. The locations of heat flux sensor are  illustrated Figure 33 and Figure 34. 

3.7 Moisture sensor trouble-shooting
Troubleshooting  of  the  data  acquisition  system  began  with  the  initial  data  collection  during  the  first  week of October 2012. The MC sensors were tested for accuracy by placing a 9.6 M  resistor across the  sensor leads and compared with the value of the datalogger output. This process also verified the wiring  and  programming  by  ensuring  that  the  datalogger  recorded  the  measurements  at  the  correct  sensor  location.  

47   

  On  October  22,  two  malfunctioning  Tsensors  associated  with  the  lower  OSB  MC  sensors  in  S1  and  S7  were  replaced.  This  work  was  completed  at  the  same  time  as  the  installation  of  the  MC  sensor  isolators  in walls S1, S2, N1, and N2.  

3.7.1 Isolation of moisture content sensors in cellulose walls
The  initial  data  indicated  that  the  framing  and  OSB  MC  measurements  in  wall  Types  37  were  within  expectations  and  compared  well  between  test  panels  as  well  as  with  the  calculated  EMC.  The  MC  measurements  in  wall  Types  1  &  2,  however,  were  generally  higher  due  to  decreased  resistance  between the MC sensor pins.   The shafts of the MC pins were painted with nonconductive paint; however, the soldered wire contacts  with  the  MC  pin  were  in  fact  bare.  Further  investigation  revealed  that  a  sample  of  cellulose  insulation  compacted  to  64  kg/m3  and  placed  between  the  MC  sensors  resulted  in  lower  resistivity  measurements  and  higher  calculated  MC.  These  noninsulated  electrical  connections  caused  a  bypass  circuit  through  the cellulose. The cellulose had a higher than expected electrical conductivity that appears to be related  to  the  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose.  Silicone  isolators  were  installed  on  the  affected  MC  sensors  to  eliminate this source of error. Once installed, the calculated MC for these sensors was reduced by 35%.  The isolator installation is detailed in Appendix G.   The  data  from  some  of  the  OSB  and  framing  MC  sensors  in  walls  S1,  S2,  N1,  and  N2  indicated  a  rise  in  moisture content about one week after the isolators were installed. After two weeks, some MC readings  were  higher  than  before  the  isolators  were  installed  but  this  correlates  with  cooler  weather  and  condensation  within  walls  S1,  S2,  N1,  and  N2.  The  connection  between  these  MC  measurements,  condensation and the initial RH are discussed further in Section 4.4. 

3.8 Moisture loading protocol
The  HighRSI  wall  study  included  two  types  of  induced  moisture  loading  in  addition  to  the  climatic  loads  resulting  from  natural  exposure.  The  first  induced  moisture  load  was  applied  during  the  wintertime  using  a  constantvolume  flow  rate  of  interior  air  that  was  injected  into  each  of  the  test  assemblies  (excluding  S4).  The  second  type  of  induced  moisture  load  was  applied  during  late  spring  and  mid summer  to  simulate  rainwater  leakage.  The  rainwater  leakage  assessment  was  beyond  the  scope  of  this  thesis.

3.8.1 Simulated air leakage test
The air leakage test was administered through the lower access port in the  test walls as shown in Figure  33 and Figure 34. The air was piped from a centralized location through 25 mm polyethylene tubing to  a  flow  meter  placed  at  each  wall.  The  air  pump  is  shown  in  Figure  38a  and  a  typical  wall  connection  is  shown  in  Figure  38b.  The  exhaust  port  in  the  upper  plate  was  accessed  with  a  25mm  drill  bit  through  the interior drywall and 6mil polyethylene to allow the injected air to leave the wall cavity and return to  the BEG Hut interior.  

Figure38aCentralairpumpusedforinjectiontest

Figure38b Airinjectionportattestwall

The  central  air  pump  maintained  the  flow  and  pressure  on  the  piping  system  while  the  injection  rate  was  adjusted  individually  at  each  wall  through  the  flow  meter.  The  air  injection  test  was  started  on  February  19,  2013  at  16:30  hours  with  the  constant  flow  rate  set  to  0.315  l/s  (40  SCFH).  Weekly  inspections  noted  that  once  the  flow  rate  was  set  at  the  wall,  the  injection  rate  held  steady  and  no  fluctuations  in  flow  rate  were  observed.  The  moisture  content  of  the  OSB  and  plates  were  monitored  throughout the test and once the walls were subjected to a sufficient degree of wetting, the airflow was  removed  and  the  top  exhaust  ports  were  covered  with  building  tape  to  eliminate  air  movement.  The  walls were then monitored throughout the drying period.  The  air  injection  system  maintained  the  0.315  L/s  flow  rate  through  each  of  the  test  walls  wall  at  a  low  pressure  of  approximately  5  Pa,  which  is  characteristic  of  natural  pressure  differentials  that  typically  occur  across  wall  assemblies  in  the  absence  of  an  elevated  stack  effect  or  high  wind  velocity.  The  0.315 

49   

  L/s  flow  rate  was  normalized  to  the  central  wall  cavity  area  (1.31  m2)  and  the  total  wall  panel  area  (2.9  m2)  in  order  to  determine  its  NLR5  for  comparison  with  the  air  tightness  target NLRs from Section 2.8.4. These  NLR5  data  were  0.24  L/sm2  for  the  central  cavity  and  0.11  L/sm2  for  the  total  test  panel  area.  The  central

cavity NLR5 applies to most of the High RSI wall types with the exception of wall Type 1.   The  stud  cavities  of  wall  type  1  are  connected  by  the  57  mm  space  between  the  interior  and  exterior  framing assemblies, which enables air to flow between the stud cavities. However, the placement of the  upper  exhaust  port  in  the  upper  plates  above  the  central  cavity  represents  the  path  of  least  resistance  for airflow, which may have bias flow through the central cavity. The actual flow rate for the Type 1 wall  is uncertain but it will fall between the 0.11 and 0.24 L/sm2 NLR5 values.  In  order  to  compare  the  air  injection  rate  with  the  air  tightness  targets,  the  NLR75  data  were  converted  to  NLR5  data  using  equation  20.  These  NLR5  data  are  presented  in  Table  34.  The  central  cavity  NLR5  injection  rate  of  0.24  L/sm2  compares  well  with  the  target  value  for  the  USACE  as  well  as  the  ASHRAE  target for average enclosures.   The  NLR  leakage  rates  specified  in  Table  34  represent  building  leakage  rates,  which  include  windows  and other openings as well as assembly penetrations. The simulated air leakage test considers that all air  leakage  associated  with  penetrations  enters  the  wall  cavity,  which  may  be  considered  a  worstcase  investigation of a 0.24 L/sm2 NLR5 air leakage rate. 

3.8.2 Air tightness test data
Prior  to  the  air  leakage  test,  each  wall  assembly  was  tested  for  air  tightness  using  suction  test  with  flow  rates  from  0  to  200  CFH  (0  to  1.6  L/s).  The  maximum  pressure  drop  ranged  from  80  to  91  Pa  in  walls  S1  & N2 up to 436 Pa in wall N7. The air tightness data are presented in Figure 39. This chart compares the  wall  types  and  orientation  using  the  air  leakage  rate  at  75  Pa  and  normalized  with  the  surface  area  of  the  test  panels  (L/sm2).  The  data  in  Figure  39  show  that  the  two  deep  cavity  walls,  Types  1  &  2,  have  similar  leakage  rates  with  the  exception  of  the  north  facing  double  stud  (N1),  which  has  an  air  leakage  50   

 

Figure39Airtightnesscomparisonbasedonwalltypeandorientation(L/sm2 at75Pa)

rate  about  30%  lower.  Similar  differences  were  also  noticed  in  the  datum  wall  (Type  3)  pair  as  well  as  the  XPS  wall  (Type  6)  pair.  The  suction  test  data  are  presented  as  pressure  response  versus  flow  rate  charts  in  Figure  310.  The  pressure  data  for  N7  indicate  that  a  blockage  of  the  air  leakage  path  occurred  during the test or some equipment related failure occurred that rendered these data uncertain.  The difference in air leakage rates between the north and south facing walls highlights the variation that  occurs  in  construction  even  when  great  care  is  taken  during  construction.  Other  sources  of  uncertainty  associated  with  the  air  tightness  data  relate  to  the  measurement  procedure  during  the  test  as  well  as  any  leakage  that  may  have  occurred  at  the  air  injection  port's  seal  with  the  6mil  poly  or  drywall.  In  addition,  although  the  central  cavities  of  wall  Types  27  were  hygrothermally  isolated  by  the  two  side  cavities,  air  leakage  between  the  central  and  side  cavities  could  occur  between  the  plates  and  the  studs  as well as through the 3 mm expansion space at the sheathing joint.

4 HYGROTHERMAL ANALYSIS
The  central  stud  cavity  within  each  wall  assembly  was  instrumented  with  three  OSB  MCsensors  (lower,  middle,  upper)  and  two  framing  MC  sensors  in  the  upper  and  lower  plates.  An  RH/T  bundle  was  also  located  in  the  centre  of  the  stud  cavity.  The  data  collected  from  these  sensors were  evaluated  based  on  wall type and orientation through three distinct study intervals:  1. A fall/winter baseline period from November 20 to February 19  2. A wintertime air leakage test from February 19 to April 8  3. A springtime drying period extending from April 8 to June 3  The  variability  of  vapour  pressure  in  response  to  climatic  conditions  was  determined  and  its  effect  on  the OSB and framing moisture content was evaluated over each of these three study intervals. Each wall  assembly was also compared between wall types, orientation as well as with the relevant datum wall.   The wall assembly components and their wall identification numbers are restated here for convenience.  The deep cavity walls and the datum wall are designated as follows with colour codes used in graphing:      Type 1 (S1, N1) ­ Double Stud with densepacked cellulose  Type 2 (S2, N2) ­ IJoist Stud with densepacked cellulose  Type 3 (S3, N3) ­ 38x140 mm Datum with fibreglass cavity insulation  Type 4 (S4) ­ 38x184 mm (Spray Foam) 

The  remaining  three  wall  types  were  constructed  using  the  Type  3  Datum  framing  as  a  base  with  fibreglass  cavity  insulation  and  configured  with  three  different  types  of  exterior  insulation.  These  three  wall assemblies are identified as:     Type 5 (S5, N5) ­ 38x140 mm 50 mm (RSI 2.18) Polyisocyanurate  Type 6 (S6, N6) ­ 38x140 mm 64 mm (RSI 2.21) Extruded Polystyrene  Type 7 (S7, N7) ­ 38x140 mm 76 mm (RSI 2.11) Mineral Wool 

4.1 Weather
Several  important  weather  statistics  are  summarized  below  in  Table  41.  The  water  vapour  pressure  differentials  were  calculated  using  the  difference  between  the  exterior  and  interior  partial  vapour pressures  (RH/T  data).  These  pressure  differentials  express  the  outward  flow  of  water  vapour  as  53   

  positive.  The  vapour  drive  was  predominantly  outward  during  the  three  analysis  periods;  however,  the  drying  period  experienced  a  greater  percentage  of  inward  vapour  drives  because  of  the  warmer  wet  weather  in  the  spring.  The  relative  amount  of  time  that  an  outward  vapour  drive  occurred  during  the  baseline, air injection and drying phases were 91%, 98%, and 67% respectively.   The  average  wind  speed  was  3  m/s  with  an  average  westerly  wind  direction  during  each  of  these  analysis periods. The complete weather dataset is presented in Appendix H.

4.2 Vertical temperature profiles
Data  from  the  five  central  cavity  OSB  and  framing  Tsensors  were  compared  to  determine  the  vertical  temperature  profile  of  each  test  wall.  Overall,  the  temperature  differences  between  the  lower  and  upper  OSB  sensors  averaged  0.31.4  °C.  The  maximum  daytime  temperature  differences  ranged  from  2.3°C  on  cloudy  days  to  12.1°C  on  sunny  days  for  the  south  orientation.  The  maximum  daytime  temperature  differences  of  the  northfacing  walls  were  between  2.1  to  3.9°C.  The  overnight  temperature differences for both orientations were less than 0.5°C.   During the baseline period, the largest vertical temperature differences were observed in wall Types 14.  The  maximum  temperature  differences  in  these  walls  ranged  from  7°C  to  12°C  in  the  south  facing  walls  to  between  3°C  and  4°C  for  the  north  facing  walls.  Lower  vertical  temperature  differences  were  observed  in  wall  Types  57.  Generally,  the  differences  between  the  upper  and  lower  sensors  of  the  OSB  were  25°C  for  the  south  walls  and  23°C  for  the  north.  The  top  and  bottom  framing  plates  exhibited  similar behaviour between the wall  types. The exteriorinsulated walls had lower temperature gradients  between  the  upper  and  lower  plates  than  the  walls  with  uninsulated  sheathing  while  the  northfacing 

54   

 

Figure41TypicalverticalOSBtemperature profileforsouthfacingwallTypes14(S1Datashown)

walls  had  lower  vertical  temperature  gradients  than  the  south  walls  and  less  variation  between  wall  types.   The  temperature  gradients  of  the  framing  plates  ranged  between  815°C  in  walls  S14  and  4  to  6°C  in  walls S57. There vertical temperature gradients between the upper and lower plates of the north facing  walls ranged between 2 to 4 °C in walls N17.   The  graphs  in  Figure  41  and  Figure  42  show  the  vertical  OSB  temperature  profile  in  S1  and  N1  during  two  clear  sunny  days  separated  by  a  cold, 15°C  night  (February  911,  2013).  These  data  in  these  figures  are representative of the walls without exterior insulation.

Figure43TypicalverticalOSBtemperatureprofileforsouthfacingwallTypes57(S7Datashown)

Further  analysis  of  walls  S14  showed  that  the  middle  and  upper  temperatures  tracked  closely  together  and,  with  the  exception  S3,  the  upper  temperature  was  generally  slightly  higher.  During  periods  of  solar  heating,  the  lower  OSB  Tsensor  data  were  consistently  cooler  than  the  upper  and  middle  data  on  the  south  orientation.  In  contrast,  the  lower  OSB  Tsensor  data  of  walls  N13  were  consistently  higher  than  the  upper  and  middle  Tsensor  data.  Reasons  for  these  temperature  differences  include  convection  in  the drainage space, mass effect of the ground, solar angle and albedo as well as wind effects.   Figure  43  and  Figure  44  show  the  typical  vertical  OSB  temperature  profiles  for  exterior  insulated  walls  during  the  same  February  time  interval.  These  temperature  data  indicate  that  the  exterior  insulation  resulted in a lower temperature gradient when compared to the datum wall since the exterior insulation 

Figure44TypicalverticalOSBtemperatureprofileforthenorthfacingwallTypes57(N7Datashown)

56   

  significantly  reduced  the  daily  temperature  fluctuations  of  the  OSB  sheathing.  For  further  comparisons  between each wall type, the temperature profiles during this analysis period are presented in Appendix I  along  with  the  associated  wind,  temperature  and  solar  radiation  data.  These  vertical  temperature  profiles  also  illustrate  the  stabilizing  effect  of  the  exterior  insulation  on  the  temperature  oscillations  of  the  sheathing.  This  reduction  in  the  severity  of  these  daily  temperature  oscillations  could  enhance  durability by  minimizing the number of freezing  cycles experienced by the OSB  and hence, less stress on  the  glued  strands  as  the  adsorbed  water  vapour  changes  phase.  This  effect  would  be  more  pronounced  at higher moisture contents with some critical moisture content above which damage is likely to occur.  

4.2.1 Vertical temperature profiles - air injection test
The vertical temperature  profiles of the OSB and plates were influenced by the heat associated with  the  injected  air.  This  effect  was  most  noticeable  on  the  lower  portion  of  the  OSB  and  was  quantified  using  the  average  value  of  the  temperature  differences  between  the  upper  (U)  and  lower  (L)  Tsensors  for  both the OSB and framing plates.   These  data  were  compared  between  a  pretest  period  and  the  injection  test  interval.  To  reduce  the  effects  of  seasonal  influences,  the  pretest  period  immediately  preceded  the  air  injection  test  and  was  limited to 49 days (same duration as the injection test). The resulting data are expressed as temperature  change in °C and summarized below in Table 42 for the OSB and Table 43 for the framing plates.

Since  test  panel  S4  (ccSPF)  was  not  included  in  the  air  injection  test,  its  average  vertical  T  value  represents  the  seasonal  error  associated  with  the  temperature  change  estimations.  The  negative  T  values  for  the  plates  of  S2  and  N2  indicate  that  the  upper  plates  were  warmer  than  the  lower  plates.  These negative data coincide with the heavy (38x241mm) plates used in the Type 2 wall assembly.   To  illustrate  the  effect  of  the  injected  air,  Figure  45  is  presented  with  the  vertical Tdata  of  the  north facing  assemblies.  The  upper  data  plot  illustrates  the  vertical T  of  the  deep  cavity  walls  relative  to  the  57

datum  while  the  lower  plot  shows  this  temperature  effect  on  the  exteriorinsulated  walls.  Figure  45  shows  that  the  temperature  effect  of  the  air  injection  test  was  the  highest  on  the  walls  with  shallow  stud  cavities  since  there  was  less  insulation  between  the  air  injection  point  and  the  sheathing.  The  stud  cavity  depths  for  wall  Types  1  &  2  were  286  mm  and  241  mm  respectively  as  opposed  to  the  140  mm  stud  cavities  of  wall  Types  3,  and  57.  These  vertical  temperature  gradients  were  also  affected  by  the  path of the injected air within the cavity and the air tightness of the wall assembly.   Data plots of the vertical Tdata for OSB and plates of each wall are presented in Appendix J

4.3 Vertical moisture content profiles
The vertical moisture content profiles of each test assembly were assessed to determine the variation  between the OSB MCsensors and the framing plate MCsensors. This analysis was performed using the  baseline, air injection, and drying periods. Figure 46 presents the full term OSB MCdata for test walls  N2, N3 and N7 while Figure 47 presents the full term framing plate data for test wall N2, N3 and N7.  These data represent the vertical MCdata profiles of a celluloseinsulated, datum, and exterior  insulated wall. The complete sets of OSB and framing plate MCdata are located in Appendix K.   The vertical moisture content distribution was quantified by calculating the average moisture content  for each MCsensor during the baseline, air injection and drying periods. The standard deviations were  calculated for both the OSB (L, M, and U) and framing plate (B, T) datasets. These standard deviation  data functioned as divergence indicators for the MCsensor data. In addition, the average MC ranges for  the OSB and plate sensors were determined along with the maximum MC for the OSB and plates during  each analysis period. These data are presented in Table 44 for the baseline period, Table 45 for the air  injection period and Table 46 for the drying period.

4.3.1 Vertical moisture content profiles ­ baseline period
The framing and OSB MCdata varied less significantly on a daily basis than the temperature data. Three  of the four celluloseinsulated test panels however, developed a 712% MC difference between the  upper and lower sensors over the duration of the baseline analysis period (from Nov 20 to Feb 19). Table  44 contains the intrasensor variation statistics for the baseline period. The red highlight indicates the  most poorly performing walls, while the yellow highlight indicates a value moderately higher than the  datum value. The green highlight indicates the lowest value for the category and best performance.  The standard deviation data indicate that the OSB MCsensors generally varied within less than 0.5% MC  during  the  baseline  period.  The  largest  standard  deviations  occurred  in  the  walls  S1  and  N2  with  2.5%  and  2.9%  respectively.  The  plates  also  varied  less  than  1%  for  every  wall  except  S1.  Most  walls  experienced minor to negligible MC variations in between the assembly components during the baseline  period.

In terms of variability, the celluloseinsulated walls generally performed more poorly than the other wall  types.  The  widest  variability  in  the  OSB  MC  data  occurred  in  the  north  facing  IJoist  wall  (N2)  and  the  south  facing  double  stud  wall  (S1).  The  moisture  content  difference  between  the  lower  and  upper  sensors  was  78%  in  both  S1  and  N2  during  the  final  week  of  the  baseline  period.  In  addition,  the  MC  differences  between  the  upper  and  lower  framing  plates  of  walls  N1,  N2,  and  S2  were  between  24%  while the test wall S1 had a ~12% MC difference develop during the baseline period.   The  OSB  MC  sensors  of  wall  Types  5  and  6  showed  slightly  more  MCvariation  than  the  datum  wall.  These  variation  correlate  to  changes  in  the  interior  RH  of  the  BEG  Hut  since  the  6mil  polyethylene  vapour barrier was not installed in the Type 5 and 6 walls. Moisture content variability was not observed  in the either of the north or southfacing Type 7 walls.   The typical OSB moisture content variability for selected test walls is shown in the following figures from  Figure  48   through  Figure  411.  Figure  48  shows  the  nearidentical  OSB  MC  profiles  for  the  three  OSB

Figure49VerticalOSBMCprofileofwallsS57 typicalforbothnorthandsouthorientations

MC  sensors  within  the  S3  Datum  test  panel.  This  moisture  profile  was  also  typical  for  the  north  and  south orientations of wall Type 7 and the south orientation of wall Type 4.  Figure  49  shows  the  typical  moisture  content  variability  within  wall  Types  57  for  both  the  north  and  south  facing  orientations.  The  three  OSB  MCdata  plots  of  wall  Type  7  (Bottom)  were  essentially  identical while the OSB MCdata of S5 (Top) and S6 (Middle) demonstrated slight variations between the  three  OSB  MC  sensors.  These  slight  variations  of  the  vertical  MCprofiles  may  have  resulted  from  the  absence of the 6mil polyethylene vapour barrier.

Figure410BaselineOSBMCprofilesofIJoisttestwallN2(Top)andS2(Bottom)

Figure 410 presents the wide separation of the N2 OSB data in contrast to the tight correlation of the S2  OSB  MCdata.  This  figure  illustrates  the  difference  between  a  2.9%  standard  deviation  in  N2  and  the  0.2% standard deviation in S2 as shown in Table 44.   Similar  patterns  were  also  observed  in  the  Double  Stud  wall;  however,  the  greatest  separation  of  the  OSB MC data occurred in the south facing wall, S1 as opposed to the northfacing wall. The OSB MC data  for the Double Stud walls N1, S1 are shown in Figure 411.   Figure 410 and Figure 411 demonstrate that the variability in the  OSB MC between  the  walls of Type 1  &  2  is  not  necessarily  a  direct  result  of  orientation  or  wall  type  given  the  similar  stratification  observed  in  S1  and  N2.  The  standard  deviation  data  presented  in  Table  44  also  indicate  that  this  degree  of  moisture  content  stratification  was  not  present  in  each  of  the  walls  that  used  exterior  insulation  or  fibreglass  insulation  in  the  stud  cavity.  The  ccSPF  also  had  a  uniform  OSB  MC  distribution.  In  addition,  the  temperature  data  from  the  OSB  and  plate  MC/Tsensors  located  in  wall  Types  1  &2  indicated  that  these MC variations were not a result of vertical temperature differences.

Factors that may have influenced these variations are not limited to the following:       Variations in the sorption isotherm of OSB   Variations in OSB density  Variations in cellulose density and its sorption isotherm  Variations in the initial moisture content of the cellulose  Electrical / conductivity effects of the fire retardant used on the cellulose 

More RH/T sensors installed vertically within the cellulose cavity would assist in understanding the cause  of  these  variations  in  the  OSB  MCprofile.  The  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose  insulation  should  also  be  confirmed  in  future  tests  in  order  to  rule  out  this  factor  out  as  a  possibility.  The  relationship  between OSB density and its sorption isotherm would also help to reduce uncertainty.  
4.3.1.1

Cellulose installation note

The  cellulose  insulation  used  in  these  walls  was  recycled  from  a  previous  project  and  stored  in  large,  vapour  permeable  bags.  During  longterm  storage  and  prior  to  use,  the  lower  portions  of  the  bags  were  in  contact  with  the  cooler  temperatures  near  the  cement  floor,  which  may  have  stratified  in  the  moisture content of the cellulose within the bags.   64   

  The cellulose insulation was installed in the walls in the following order ­ S2, S1, N1, and N2. The lowest  moisture content cellulose was in the top of the bag, which was installed in S2. The lower portion of that  bag,  with  a  higher  moisture  content  level  was  then  blown  into  S1  and  wall  N1  received  the  top  of  the  next  bag  while  N2  was  filled  with  the  remainder  of  the  higherMC  cellulose  that  was  closest  to  the  floor  at the bottom of the bag. This does  not indicate the cause of  the  OSB MC variations in wall Types 1 & 2;  it merely indicates a potential source of uncertainty and possible contributing factor.   Note: When  these vertical  MC profiles  were first observed, the sensor wires and connections were tested  and  reverified  as  well  as  the  DAU  programming  to  ensure  that  the  datalogger  had  recorded  the  correct  data from the intended sensor location ­ all connections were found to be correct. 

4.3.2 Vertical moisture content profiles ­ air leakage test
The  intrasensor  variation  statistics  for  the  air  injection  period  are  presented  in  Table  45.  The  red  highlight  indicates  the  most  poorly  performing  walls,  while  the  yellow  highlight  indicates  a  value  moderately  slightly  atrisk  or  higher  than  the  datum  value.  The  green  highlight  indicates  the  lowest  value for the category and best performance.  The  vertical  OSB  MC  profiles  of  the  celluloseinsulated  walls  N12  and  S2,  as  well  as  the  north  datum  wall  N3  were  inverted  during  the  air  leakage  test.  The  lower  OSB  MC  data  in  these  walls  were  consistently  higher  than  the  data  collected  from  the  middle  and  upper  OSB  MC  sensors  because  of  the  proximity  of  these  MCsensors  to  the  air  injection  point.  In  addition,  the  average  values  of  the  OSB  MC data  collected  in  the  south  facing  walls  were  lower  than  the  data  collected  from  the  north  facing  walls,  which  indicates  that  solar  heating  was  and  important  performance  facture  during  this  test.

OSB  MC  profiles  were  also  less  well  defined  in  the  S1  and  N2  walls  as  the  injected  air  increased  the  moisture  load  within  the  cellulose  insulation  of  the  lower  portion  of  the  wall  cavity  (shown  in  Figure  412).   The  MCdata  (shown  in  Table  45)  indicate  that  the  largest  increase  in  framing  plate  MC  occurred  in  the  northfacing  celluloseinsulated  walls.  During  the  air  injection  period,  the  MC  of  the  lower  N2  plate  rose  to  over  35%  MC  and  the  MC  of  the  lower  N1  plate  increased  to  over  50%.  The  higher  MC  in  the  Double  stud  walls  resulted  from  the  thermal  break  between  the  two  framing  layers  that  isolated  the  exterior  38x140mm plate members. These plate data are presented in Appendix K.  The  exteriorinsulated  walls  performed  well  during  the  air  injection  test.  In  contrast  to  the  cellulose insulated  and  datum  walls,  the  lower  OSB  MCdata  were  only  slightly  affected  by  the  injected  air  since  the exterior insulation of wall Types 57 maintained much higher OSB temperatures in the lower section  of  the  cavity.  In  general,  the  middle  and  upper  OSB  sensors  responded  to  the  injected  air  with  similar  increases in moisture content.   The  OSB  MC  of  wall  Types  57  indicated  that  the  sheathing  of  these  walls  were  safe  during  the  air  injection  test.  The  plate  data  reveal,  however,  that  the  upper  and  lower  plates  of  N5  did  not  perform  as  well  since  the  peak  MC  readings  of  upper  plate  was  22.5%  and  the  lower  plate  was  17.8%.  The  upper  plate  MC  in  N6  peaked  at  18.2%  during  this  test  period.  By  comparison,  the  upper  and  lower  plates  in  walls S7 and N7 remained below 15%. These plate data are presented in Figure 413.

4.3.3 Vertical moisture content profile ­ drying period
The intrasensor variation statistics for the air injection period are presented in Table 46. The maximum  moisture  content  data  were  replaced  by  the  minimum  or  lowest  moisture  content  recorded  at  the  end  of  the  drying  period.  The  red  highlight  indicates  the  most  poorly  performing  walls,  while  the  yellow  highlight indicates a value moderately slightly atrisk or higher than the datum value. The green highlight  indicates the lowest value for the category and best performance.   The  data  in  Table  46  show  that  the  vertical  OSB  MC  profiles  of  walls  S1  and  N2  converged  to  less  than  1%  standard  deviation,  which  eliminated  the  wide  vertical  MC  profile  that  existed  during  the  baseline  period (see Figure 412). In contrast, the vertical OSB MC profiles of test walls N1 and N3 increased after  the  air  leakage  test  because  of  the  interstitial  condensation.  The  moisture  content  of  the  lower  framing  plates  in  walls  N13  also  remained  elevated  at  the  end  of  the  drying  period  relative  to  the  upper  plate  because of the extensive condensation that occurred during the air injection period.   The  MCdata  for  test  walls  N12  are  presented  in  Figure  414  to  illustrate  the  extent  of  the  wetting  that  occurred in during the air injection test.   67

The  OSB  and  framing  plate  MC  profiles  in  each  of  the  south  facing  walls  varied  by  less  than  1%  MC  standard  deviation.  Both  orientations  of  the  exterior  insulated  walls  performed  well  during  the  drying  period and the Type 7 wall had the best overall performance.

4.4 Condensation risk assessment

To  determine  the  water  vapour  partial  pressure  (Pw)  for  the  air  in  the  stud  cavity,  Pws  was  calculated  using  Equation  21  and  the  temperature  data  from  the  RH/T  sensor  bundle  located  in  the  centre  of  the  stud cavity as well as the relationship (ASHRAE, 2009):

The  condensation  potential  of  each  wall  was  expressed  as  the  hours  where  the  RH  at  the  sheathing  was  greater  than  100%.  The  relationships  in  Equations  21  and  22  were  also  used  to  determine  the  vapour  pressure  drive  between  the  interior  and  exterior  air  as  well  as  between  the  stud  cavity  and  drainage  space.

The  number  of  condensation  hours  represents  the  time  that  the  temperature  of  the  interior  side  of  the  sheathing  was  below  dew  point  or  above  100%  RH  based  on  the  hourly  recorded  sensor  data.  The  condensation  hours  were  determined  for  the  middle  OSB  MCsensor  inline  with  the  RH/T  bundle  located  middepth  at  the  vertical  centre  of  the  stud  cavity  (J'J  in  Figure  34).  The  condensation  hours  were  also  calculated  for  the  remaining  MCsensor  locations  using  the  assumption  that  the  RHsensor  data  from  the  central  stud  cavity  location  was  representative  of  the  upper  and  lower  reaches  of  the  cavity.  The  vertical  MCprofiles  examined  in  Section  4.3  suggested  that  this  assumption  was  valid  for  wall Types 37 but was subject to uncertainty in wall Types 12. This uncertainty arises from hygroscopic  nature  of  the  cellulose  and  the  potential  for  variable  cellulose  moisture  contents  within  the  stud  cavity.  In addition, this uncertainty will tend to bias the condensation results lower for the upper OSB and plate  locations  and  higher  for  the  lower  OSB  and  plate  locations  given  the  tendency  of  moisture  content  to  increase with height within the Type 1 and 2 walls.    The  baseline  period  for  this  assessment  began  on  November  20,  2012  after  the  installation  of  the  spray  foam  insulation  in  S4.  The  column  charts  presented  in  Figure  415  show  the  calculated  condensation  69   

  hours  for  each  MC/T  sensor  location.  These  data  were  separated  into  the  baseline,  air  injection  and  drying  periods. The number of condensation hours  that occurred in the Type 1  and 2  celluloseinsulated  walls were consistently higher than the condensation that occurred in the remaining wall types.   Further,  the  Type  1  Double  Stud  wall  plates  were  subjected  to  the  most  condensation  hours  since  these  framing members were thermally broken by the 57 mm space between the 89 mm and 140 mm frames.  The  upper  framing  plates  and  OSB  MCdata  of  the  northfacing  wall  Types  25  had  more  condensation  hours  during  the  air  injection  test  than  the  lower  wall  components.  The  celluloseinsulated  walls  were  also the only walls to experience condensation hours during the drying period.

4.5 Mould and decay analysis
High  humidity  levels  and  condensation  within  wall  assemblies  promotes  the  growth  of  mould  on  wood based  components.  As  the  moisture  content  of  woodbased  materials  increases  above  the  fibre  saturation  point,  the  potential  for  wood  decay  increases.  The  risk  analysis  parameters  for  the  growth  of  mould and onset of decay that were determined from the literature review in Section 2.9.1 are the total  number of hours the assembly exceeds the following criteria:  1. The onset of mould growth at 16 % MC and the minimum temperature for mould growth (5°C)  2. The fast growth of mould at 20% MC and 10° C,   3. The onset of decay as MC rises above 28% until the MC falls below 20% MC  i. Onset of decay using 99 % RH and 10°C (for comparison) 

The analysis period for mould growth and decay began on November 20, 2013 after the spray foam was  installed  and  ended  on  June  3,  2013.  The  results  for  the  first  risk  parameter  were  determined  using  the  baseline,  air  injection,  and  drying  periods  to  better  illustrate  the  origin  of  mould  growth  risk.  The  atrisk  hours were calculated at each main cavity MC/T sensor for the OSB and framing. 

4.5.1 Onset of mould ­ slow growth assessment
The  results  of  the  first  risk  parameter  for  the  onset  of  mould  growth  are  presented  in  Figure  416.  The  data are separated into the baseline, air injection and drying periods within the figure. Figure 416 (Top)  shows  that  the  top  plate  of  the  south  facing  Double  Stud  wall  S1  was  atrisk  of  mould  growth  for  approximately  460  hours.  The  remaining  south  facing  walls  had  little  to  no  risk  of  mould  growth  during  the  baseline  period.  This  figure  also  indicates  that  within  walls  N1  and  N2,  the  top  and  bottom  plates  also  had  a  risk  of  mould  growth  in  the  range  of  125  to  365  hours.  In  addition,  the  upper  OSB  sensor  location  in  N2  had  264  risk  hours,  which  coincides  with  the  elevated  MCdata  observed  in  Figure  410  (Top).  The  moisture  content  levels  within  the  remaining  Northfacing  walls  N3  through  N7  were  maintained below the 16% MC threshold and no mould growth risk was observed.   The  mould  risk  for  the  air  injection  period  is  shown  in  Figure  416  (Middle).  The  mould  growth  risk  was  most  apparent  in  the  test  walls  S13  with  the  plates  being  most  atrisk.  The  lower  plate  of  the  datum  wall  S3,  was  the  most  atrisk  with  626  hours.  The  upper  plate  of  the  exterior  insulated  wall  S5  (polyisocyanurate)  had  175  risk  hours,  while  the  other  two  exterior  insulated  walls  S6  and  S7  did  not  have any atrisk hours.

Figure416Onsetofmouldgrowthduringthebaseline(Top),airinjection(Middle)anddrying(Bottom)periods (MC>16%,T>5°C)

The  effects  of  the  injected  air  were  most  noticeable  in  the  northfacing  walls.  The  injected  air  affected  the  OSB  and  plates  of  both  wall  Types  1  &  2  as  well  as  the  datum  wall.  The  lower  framing  plate  and  lower  OSB  within  the  datum  wall  N3  had  the  highest  risk  hours  of  these  component  in  all  of  the  north  facing  walls  with  514  and  401  risk  hours,  respectively.  The  risk  hours  for  the  Type  1  &  2  walls  were  evenly  distributed  throughout  these  walls,  which  averaged  approximately  200  hours  at  each  MCsensor  location. The most dramatic effect of the air leakage was observed in the upper framing plate of wall N5  with  783  atrisk  hours.  Wall  N6  had  331  risk  hours  in  its  upper  framing  plate  while  sensor  locations  within test wall N7 remained below the mould growth criteria.  

72   

  Figure  416  (Bottom)  shows  the  mould  growth  risks  associated  with  the  drying  period.  This  figure  indicates that the upper and lower plates of the S1 test wall were the only south facing wall components  atrisk  during  this  period.  The  lower  plates  of  the  northfacing  walls  N13  were  significantly  atrisk  of  decay  with  between  1117  and  1204  risk  hours  in  these  components.  This  increase  in  decay  risk  is  associated  with  residual  moisture  from  the  air  leakage  test  and  higher  springtime  temperatures.  The  upper  plate  of  N5  was  the  only  component  of  the  north  facing  exterior  insulated  walls  to  have  atrisk  hours during this period.  

4.5.2 Fast mould growth assessment
The  second  parameter  for  mould  growth  assessed  the  risk  of  fast  growing  mould  within  the  wall  assemblies.  This  analysis  compiled  the  number  of  hours  that  each  MC/T  sensor  location  was  exposed  to  20%  MC  or  higher  with  temperatures  above  10°C.  The  assessment  results  presented  in  Figure  417  represent  the  combined  atrisk  hours  accumulated  during  the  baseline,  air  injection  test,  and  drying  periods.   The  data  presented  in  Figure  417  show  that  only  south  facing  wall  components  atrisk  of  faster  mould 

Figure417Fastgrowthmouldrisktotalhoursoverstudyperiod(MC>20%,T>10°C)

growth  were  the  upper  and  lower  plates  of  S1  with  an  average  of  290  hours.  The  lower  plate  in  S3  only  registered 90 atrisk hours.   The  northfacing  test  wall  components  to  accumulate  the  most  atrisk  with  the  fast  mould  growth  criteria  were  the  bottom  plates  of  N1  and  N2.  These  components  had  significantly  more  risk  hours  than  any other component in the test with an average of 820 risk hours each. By comparison, the lower plate  of the datum wall N3 had 178 hours. The lower OSB of walls N1 and N2 both had less than 100 risk hours  during the course of the study period.

4.5.3 Decay assessment
The third parameter for fungal growth assessed the level of risk associated with the onset of decay. This  analysis  compiled  the  number  of  hours  that  each  MC/T  sensor  location  was  exposed  to  RH  greater  than  99%  and  temperatures  above  10°C.  The  results  of  this  assessment  are  presented  in  Figure  418.  These  results indicate the  combined atrisk hours above 99% RH accumulated during the baseline, air injection  test, and drying periods for each of the test walls. 

Figure418DecayriskassessmentinOSB(RH>99%,T>10°C)

The south facing walls were the least atrisk of decay as walls S4 to S7 did not have any hours at 99% RH  and  walls  S1,  S2,  and  S3  had  negligible  exposure  to  99%  RH.  Since  decay  remains  active  until  the  moisture  content  returns  below  20%  ­  after  exceeding  the  28%  MC  threshold  (2009  ASHRAE)  ­  the  MC data  were  investigated  further  for  a  better  estimation  of  the  atrisk  time  for  each  wall.  This  assessment  used  the  cumulative  hours  between  the  onset  of  decay  at  28%  MC  and  the  suspension  of  active  decay  below  20%  MC.  The  results  of  this  further  assessment  are  located  in  Figure  419  and  they  indicate  that  the lower OSB was at risk of decay in walls N1, N2, and N3, while the lower plates in S1, N1, and N2 had  significant decay risk.  

Figure419DecayriskfromMCdata(28%dryingto20%)

74   

  The worst performing wall plates were the lower framing of N1 and N2. These walls each had over 2200  hours at risk of decay and the moisture content of the N1 lower plate was still well above 20% MC at the  end  of  the  drying  period.  The  N1  lower  plate  was  still  hovering  around  20%  MC  on  July  24th,  2013.  In  comparison,  the  lower  plate  of  south  facing  Double  Stud  wall  (S1)  had  1327  atrisk  hours.  The  moisture  content of the S1 lower plate had dried below 20% MC by April 30th, 2013.  The  moisture  content  versus  time  charts  for  the  lower  plates  of  wall  Types  13  are  presented  in  Figure  420  (North)  and  Figure  421  (South).  These  figures  illustrate  the  relative  decay  risk  before,  during  and  after  the  air  injection  test.  The  highest  MC  reached  by  any  sensor  in  the  study  occurred  in  the  N1  lower  plate  where  it  rose  to  ~50%.  The  N1  wall  had  over  2000  hours  above  the  28%  MC  threshold.  The 

Figure420LowerplatemoisturecontentinwallsN1,N2andN3(datum)fromJan1toJune15,2013

Figure421LowerplatemoisturecontentinwallsS1,S2andS3(datum)fromJan1toJune15,2013

accuracy of the electric moisture sensors degrades above the FSP, which results in greater uncertainty in  the absolute value of measurements above 30% MC point   Figure  421  shows  that  the  moisture  content  of  the  S1  and  S2  lower  plates  were  similar  to  the  lower  plate  moisture  content  in  the  datum  wall  (S3)  prior  to  the  air  injection  test.  In  comparison,  the  lower 

75   

  plate  moisture  contents  of  N1  and  N2  were  elevated  by  about  68%  relative  to  the  datum.  The  lower  plate  MCdata  of  N1  and  N2  presented  in  Figure  420  show  that  these  walls  were  susceptible  to  mould  damage prior to the air injection test. The lower plate in wall N2 finally dried below 20% MC in midJune  (2013)  and  returned  to  its  pretest  moisture  content.  The  excessive  wetting  of  the  lower  plates  was  a  direct  result  of  the  condensation  that  drained  from  the  OSB  during  the  air  injection  test.  The  risk  of  decay in the OSB was confined to the lower MC/T sensor location in walls N1, N2, and N3.   A  comparison  of  lower  OSB  MC  for  walls  N13  is  presented  in  Figure  422.  The  lower  OSB  MC  in  N3  reached  the  28%  MC  threshold  first  during  the  air  injection  test  but  was  able  to  quickly  dry  below  20%  MC.  Since  the  cellulose  insulation  buffered  the  moisture  load  of  the  air  injection  test,  it  delayed  the  moisture  content  increase  of  the  OSB  sheathing  (N1  and  N2).  However,  the  cellulose  also  inhibited  drying  since  its  adsorbed  water  supplied  moisture  to  the  OSB  after  the  air  injection  test  was  concluded,  which  prolonged  the  drying  time  required  to  lower  the  N1  and  N2  lower  OSB  MC  below  20%.  The  three  wetting cycles visible in the N3 profile are associated with cold weather and warming trends.

4.6 Water vapour drive
The  difference  in  the  partial  pressures  of  water  vapour  across  an  assembly  determines  the  wetting  and  drying  potential  of  a  wall.  The  water  vapour  gradient  across  the  wall  determines  the  direction  and  rate  of  flow  while the  temperature  regime  determines  whether  wetting  or  drying  will  occur.  The  factors  that  influence  the  direction  and  magnitude  of  vapour  drives  are  the  structure's  orientation  to  wind  driven  rain  and  direct  heating  by  the  sun,  the  water  absorption,  water  vapour  permeability  and  storage  capacity  of  its  components  as  well  as  the  amount  of  ventilation  available  to  remove  moisture  from  drainage spaces. 

76   

  The  RH/T  sensor  data  and  Equations  21  &  22  were  used  to  calculate  the  partial  water  vapour  pressures  (VP) of the main stud cavity and drainage space. These data determined the vapour pressure differential  across  the  OSB  and  in  the  case  of  wall  Types  57,  the  exterior  insulation  as  well.  These  partial  pressure  differentials  were  normalized  using  the  distance  between  the  RH/T  sensor  bundles,  which  resulted  in  a  pressure  gradient  that  could  be  used  to  gauge  performance  between  the  different  wall  types.  The  VP  gradient  was  calculated  by  subtracting  the  exterior  VP  from  the  interior  VP,  thus  a  positive  VP  represents outward moisture flow (drying).   The  following  two  sets  of  charts  presented  in  Figure  423  and  Figure  424  compare  the  differences  between  the  north  and  south  vapour  drives  and  its  effect  on  the  OSB  MC  of  wall  Types  1,  3,  and  7  on  October  25  &  26,  2012.  The  selected  wall  types  illustrate  the  performance  differences  between  a  deep  cavity  cellulose  wall,  the  datum  wall,  and  an  exterior  insulated  wall.  Wall  Type  7  was  chosen  for  comparison  as  its  vapour  control  system  uses  6mil  polyethylene  vapour  barrier.  Figure  423  shows  the  effect  of  a  sunny  day  on  the  vapour  drive  in  walls  S1  and  N1.  The  initial  inward  vapour  drive  (ve)  was  most  pronounced  on  the  south  facing  wall,  however,  this  initial  inward  vapour  drive  reversed  in  the  afternoon.

  The  VP  and  OSB  MC  profiles  for  the  datum  walls  are  presented  the  top  two  charts  of  Figure  424.  The  datum  walls  had  steeper  VP  gradients  than  their  Type  1  counterparts  did.  The  daily  solar  radiation  had  an increased effect on the OSB in the datum wall since the OSB MC was not buffered by the hygroscopic  cellulose  within  the  stud  cavity.  This  effect  was  observed  as  a  slight  drop  in  the  north  OSB  MC  and  a  much  larger  decrease  in  the  south  OSB  MC.  The  range  of  the  VP  gradient  was  also  much  higher  in  the  datum walls than in the double stud walls. The inward VP dissipated quickly in the southfacing datum as  the exterior drainage cavity was well ventilated with the exterior air. In addition, the siding did not have  significant moisture storage that would have otherwise maintained a higher VP in the exterior cavity.   The  lower  two  plots  in  Figure  424  shows  the  VP  and  OSB  MC  profiles  for  the  north  and  south  facing  Type  7  exterior  insulated  walls.  The  north  facing  OSB  MC  only  had  a  slight  decrease  because  of  daytime  heating  while  the  changes  in  the  southfacing  OSB  MC  were  also  quite  muted  in  comparison  with  the  datum  wall.  The  overall  range  of  the  south  facing  VP  drive  was  much  less  than  either  the  datum  or  the  double stud walls.  

4.7 Inter-wall moisture content analysis
The  interwall  moisture  content  analysis  was  performed  using  the  middle  OSB  MCdatasets  from  each  test  wall.  The  following  series  of  MCdata  comparisons  show  the  performance  of  the  various  high  RSI  value  walls  with  respect  to  the  datum  wall  based  on  the  construction  type  (deep  cavity  or  exterior  insulated) and orientation. The baseline analysis period for these plots was from Nov 20, 2012 to Feb 19,  2013. This time interval spans from when the S4 insulation was installed to the day that the air injection  test started. The exterior temperature for each analysis period was added to the charts with an inverted  scale to demonstrate the inverse relationship between temperature and moisture content.  

4.7.1 Baseline period
Figure  425  compares  the  OSB  MCdata  of  the  deep  cavity  walls  with  the  datum  wall  on  both  orientations.  The  top  chart  illustrates  the  performance  of  the  north  facing  Double  Stud  (N1)  and  IJoist  (N2)  stud  walls  with  the  northfacing  datum  (N3).  The  lower  plot  shows  the  performance  of  the  south facing deep cavity walls with the south datum.   The  south  facing  walls  had  better  moisture  performance  with  the  exception  of  the  S1.  While  S2,  S3  and  S4 had low OSB MCvalues in the 78% range and responded in unison to climatic loading, the OSB MC of  the  south  Double  Stud  wall  ranged  between  12  and  13%  MC  over  the  latter  half  of  the  analysis  period.  79   

 

Figure425BaselinecomparisonofdeepcavityOSBMCdata­ {N13(Top)andS14(Bottom)}

This  variability  in  OSB  moisture  content  as  a  function  of  cellulose  moisture  storage  was  discussed  previously in Section 4.3).   The  north  facing  deep  cavity  walls,  N1  and  N2  performed  similarly,  as  the  average  OSB  MCvalues  increased  to  between  13  and  17  %  towards  the  end  of  the  baseline  period.  The  northfacing  walls  N1  and N2 were already at risk of mold growth prior to the air injection test with MC values approaching or  exceeding the lower 16% MC threshold for mould growth (as discussed in Section 4.5).  Figure  426  compares  the  OSB  MCdata  from  the  north  and  south  exteriorinsulated  walls  with  their  respective  datum  walls.  These  performed  well  on  both  orientations  but  the  MCdata  were  less  distributed  in  the  south  walls  than  in  the  north  facing  walls.  Wall  Type  7  performed  the  best  on  both  orientations as N7 and S7 maintained the lowest OSB MC throughout the baseline period.   The OSB  MCdata of the polyisocyanurate and XPS insulated walls showed a minor increase towards the  end of the baseline period as the humidifier in the BEG Hut was serviced in midJanuary. The interior RH  had  slowly  decreased  to  the  mid20%  RH  range  over  the  course  of  two  months.  Upon  servicing,  the  interior RH was reestablished to ~40% RH prior to the air injection test. Since wall Types 5 and 6 did not  80   

 

Figure426BaselinecomparisonofexteriorinsulatedOSBMCdata­ {N57(Top)andS57(Bottom)}

use  the  6mil  polyethylene  vapour  barrier,  these  walls  responded  quickly  to  changes  in  the  interior  relative  humidity.  The  highest  MCdata  response  was  observed  in  the  north  walls  N5  and  N6  with  data  peaks at ~ 11% MC. 

4.7.2 Air injection test period
Figure  427  compares  the  OSB  MCdata  from  the  deep  cavity  walls  and  their  respective  datum  walls  during  the  constantrate  airinjection  test.  The  OSB  MCresponse  to  the  air  injection  test  was  larger  in  the  north  walls  that  the  south  walls.  The  north  datum  wall  (N3)  clearly  shows  three  distinct  cooling  trends  that  elevated  the  N3  OSB  MCdata  that  were  less  apparent  in  the  OSB  MCdata  of  the  south  datum wall (S3).   The  OSB  MCdata  of  the  northfacing  celluloseinsulated  walls  (N12)  continually  increased  throughout  the  air  injection  test,  while  the  datum  wall  N3  had  three  welldefined  drying  intervals  during  the  same  period  that  were  directly  related  to  exterior  temperature.  This  performance  difference  resulted  from  the  increased  moisture  storage  capacity  of  the  cellulose  insulation  and  its  buffering  effect  on  the  OSB.  The  moisture  storage  of  the  N3  stud  cavity  was  composed  of  fibreglass  insulation,  air  and  the  moisture  81   

 

Figure427AirinjectioncomparisonofdeepcavityOSBMCdata­ {N13(Top)andS14(Bottom)}

storage  of  the  framing.  In  contrast,  the  moisture  storage  within  deep  stud  cavities  of  walls  N1  and  N2  was  composed  of  the  cellulose  insulation  and  its  adsorbed  moisture,  air,  and  the  moisture  buffering  of  the framing. In addition, the cavity volumes were significantly greater in walls N1 and N2 because of wall  thickness.   The  OSB  MC  of  N1  and  N2  averaged  20%  MC  at  the  end  of  the  test  while  the  OSB  MC  of  the  datum  wall  was  less  than  15%  MC.  The  OSB  MCvalues  of  S1  and  S2  were  lower  overall  than  the  north  walls  and  as  expected,  the  lowest  and  most  consistent  OSB  MC  values  were  located  in  S4,  which  was  excluded  from  the  air  injection  test.  The  highest  measurements  of  the  OSB  MC  in  walls  S3  and  S1  were  between  12%  and  13%  MC.  The  south  datum  wall  was  also  faster  to  dry  than  S1  and  finished  the  test  interval  with  9%  OSB  MC  compared  to  13%  MC  in  wall  S1.  The  lower  initial  cellulose  moisture  content  in  the  I  Joist  test  wall  S2  led  to  better  moisture  performance  for  this  wall.  The  S2  OSB  MC  peaked  at  ~11%  and  finished  the test period with roughly 9% OSB MC.   The OSB MC data for the exterior insulated walls are presented in Figure 428. These data indicated that  all  three  exterior  insulated  walls  (Types  57)  outperformed  the  datum  wall  (on  both  orientations).  The  82   

 

Figure428AirinjectioncomparisonofexteriorinsulatedOSBMCdata­ {N57(Top)andS57(Bottom)}

northfacing  XPS  wall  (N6)  had  the  highest  OSB  MC  with  peaks  in  the  15%  MC  range.  The  peak  OSB  MC  in  walls  N5  and  N7  was  generally  less  than  13%.  Walls  N5  and  N6  ended  the  test  interval  with  OSB  MCs  of 10% while wall N7 had the lowest OSB MC at less than 8 %.  Each of the southfacing test walls S5, S6 and S7 also outperformed their associated datum wall during  the air injection test. Additionally, the data indicated that the exterior insulated wall S7 was essentially  unaffected by the airinjection test at the middle OSB sensor location. The S7 OSB MCdata fluctuated  within a narrow 0.5% MC range as shown in the bottom chart of Figure 428. The OSB MCdata of S5 and  S6 fluctuated between 8 and 12% throughout the test. 

4.7.3 Drying period
The  drying  curves  shown  in  Figure  429  illustrate  the  performance  of  the  deep  cavity  walls  on  both  the  north  and  south  orientations.  These  drying  trends  were  closely  related  to  the  rising  exterior  temperature  during  the  drying  period.  The  performance  of  the  northfacing  Double  stud  wall  N1  was  comparable  to  the  datum  wall  N3  as  both  walls  dried  below  9%  by  the  end  of  the  drying  period.  The  northfacing  I  Joist  wall  N2  only  dried  as  low  as  11%  because  of  the  large  amount  of  moisture  stored  in

the  celluloseinsulation  within  its  stud  cavity.  The  lower  sections  of  the  N1  and  N2  test  walls  performed  much  more  poorly  than  the  middle  and  upper  sections  during  the  air  injection  test  and  this  intrawall  variability was discussed previously in Section 4.3.  The southfacing deep  cavity walls started drying from a lower OSB MC than the north  deep  cavity walls  so  the  south  walls  were  able  to  dry  below  9%  relatively  quickly.  The  lower  chart  in  Figure  429  shows  that  the  S4  OSB  MC  remained  below  8%  for  the  duration  of  the  drying  period.  Since  the  S2,  S3  and  S4  walls  performed  similarly  during  the  baseline  period  (Figure  425)  and  S4  was  excluded  from  the  air  injection test, the S4 OSB MCdata serves as a performance target for these two walls. The OSB MCdata  show  that  both  S2  and  S3  dried  as  low  as  S4  after  45  weeks  of  drying  with  the  S2  OSB  MCdata  slightly  elevated with respect to S4 (as it was during the baseline period).   The  OSB  MCdata  for  the  exterior  insulated  walls  are  presented  inFigure  430.  These  data  indicate  that  the  north  walls  N57  outperformed  the  north  datum  wall  while  the  only  south  wall  to  outperform  the  datum  S3  was  the  test  wall  insulated  with  exterior  mineral  wool  ­  S7.  The  Type  7  walls  consistently  had  84

the  lowest  moisture  contents  of  the  walls  throughout  the  study  period  and  had  the  least  variation  between orientations. Test walls S5 and S6 dried at approximately the same rate as the south datum.  

4.8 Thermal analysis and heat flux sensor data
The  centreofcavity  (CoC)  and  centreofstud  (CoS)  thermal  resistances  of  each  wall  assembly  were  calculated  using  the  material  properties  shown  in  Table  48.  These  RSIvalues  were  compared  with  the  heat  flux  data  as  well  as  to  determine  the  Clearwall  RSI  value  for  each  wall.  As  defined  in  Christian  and  Kosny  (1995),  the  CoC  RSIvalue  defines  a  line  through  the  centre  of  an  assembly's  stud  cavity  of  an  assembly  and  Clearwall  RSI  contains  the  minimum  amount  of  framing  and  does  not  account  for  windows,  wall  and  floor  intersections,  corners  or  other  thermal  bridging  details  that  reduce  the  overall  RSIvalue  of  the  assembly.  For  the  comparison  purposes  confined  to  this  thesis,  the  Clearwall  RSIvalue  was  sufficient  for  a  rough  comparison  between  wall  types.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  more  detailed  (and  realistic)  analyses  exist  (Straube  and  Smegal,  2009)  to  determine  the  True  RSIvalue  of  building assemblies that account for specific framing issues associated with each wall assembly.  85

The  additional  wall  components  (OSB,  air  films,  air  layers,  siding  and  drywall)  increased  the  RSI  value  of  each  assembly  by  0.5  to  0.7  RSI.  The  RSI  for  the  cavity  and  the  stud  sections  include  the  interior  and  exterior surface coefficients as well as the air layer in the drainage space. The interior strapping air layer  was also included for wall Types 1 and 2 as a weighted areal average of the air layer and the strapping.  The  Clearwall  RSIvalues  for  each  test  assembly  were  determined  to  illustrate  the  effect  of  framing  factor  (FF).  Residential  housing  have  varied  FFs  due  to  construction  practices  and  can  have  average  FFs  of  25%  in  nonseismic  areas  with  the  FFs  multistorey  buildings  trending  higher  because  of  additional  framing  support  (Carpenter  and  Schumacher,  2003).  An  additional  study  by  Qasass  et  al.  (Inpress)  of  86   

  detached, semidetached and townhouses under construction in the Greater Toronto Area indicated the  average  FFs  could  be  as  high  as  31  to  39%.  Comparatively,  the  FF  recommended  by  ASHRAE  (2013)  is  25% and 19% by the National Energy Code of Canada (NECB, 2011). Clearwall RSI values were calculated  for the High RSI test assemblies using FFs of 19%, 25% and 30%. These data are presented in Table 49.

All of these calculated RSIvalues would be reduced by analysis that is more detailed. Some walls may be  disproportionately  affected  as  building  features  like  window  openings  and  floor  connections  are  considered.  The  externally  insulated  walls  have  the  added  benefit  of  providing  a  more  uniform  insulation  layer  across  floor  and  wall  connections,  which  will  help  these  walls  to  maintain  higher  True  RSIvalues in comparison with the deep cavity walls.  

4.8.1 Heat flux data analysis
The  cavity  and  stud  HF  sensors  were  installed  in  the  inboard  side  of  the  drywall  in  walls  S2,  S3,  S4  and  S5.  These  cavity  HF  sensor  was  installed  midheight  and  along  the  vertical  centreline  to  minimize  the  thermal influence of the framing  members. The stud  HF sensors were placed in  a shallow 3mm notch  to  allow  them  to  lie  flush  with  the  face  of  the  stud.  The  stud  HF  sensors  were  selected  by  size  for  the  framing  member  to  minimize  the  thermal  influences  of  the  cavity.  Since  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  stud section was higher than the cavity section, a separate temperature sensor was also installed on the  interior  surface  of  S2,  S3,  S4  and  S5  inline  with  the  stud  HF  sensor  to  provide  more  accurate  temperature data for the Uvalue calculations.   The HF sensor data were used to calculate the cavity and stud U Factors for test panels S2, S3, S4 and S5  using the following equation for steady state conditions (Hutcheon and Handegord, 1983):

The  HF  sensors  were  installed  on  the  south  facing  walls  and  were  considerably  affected  by  solar  radiation.  The  HFdata  collected  during  cloudy  periods  with  lower  solar  radiation  and  similar  daytime  /  nighttime  temperatures  were  used  to  determine  the  Uvalue  of  each  wall  as  the  heat  flux  was  most  steady  during  these  conditions.  Visual  inspection  of  the  HFdata  was  used  to  determine  the  intervals  that provided these steady conditions for Uvalue calculations.  Four  time  intervals  were  selected  when  the  temperatures  across  the  test  assemblies  were  the  most  stable.  Three  of  these  time  intervals  occurred  during  the  baseline  period  in  October,  December,  and  January. One interval occurred during the drying period in midApril.   The  data  collected  during  the  air  injection  test  was  not  reliable  for  the  Uvalue  calculations  as  the  heat  flux  was  influenced  by  the  heat  of  the  injected  air.  The  periods  selected  for  the  heat  flux  analysis  and  their average ambient temperatures are as follows:  ·  ·  ·  ·  Oct 26 to Nov 8, 2012 (Ambient Temperature: 3.9°C)  Dec 20 to 27, 2012 (Ambient Temperature: 1.8°C)  Jan 21 to 25, 2013 (Ambient Temperature: 14.2°C)  Apr 9 to 14, 2013 (Ambient Temperature: 0.8°C) 

The  heat  flux  data  collected  during  the  Apr  8  to  16,  2013  are  presented  in  Figure  431.  These  data  illustrate  the  differences  between  the  heat  flux  through  the  cavity  (Top)  and  the  stud  (Bottom).  The  daily  solar  radiation  was  included  to  demonstrate  the  influence  of  the  sun  on  the  heat  flux  through  these  walls.  The  heat  flux  data  between  April  10th  and  14th  were  used  to  calculate  the  Uvalues  presented inTable 410 since  these data were relatively steady over this period because of  the low solar  88   

  radiation.  Although  the  cavity  data  were  stable,  the  stud  data  were  much  less  steady  because  of  the  higher  thermal  conductivity  through  the  stud  section.  As  expected,  the  heat  flux  data  from  the  datum  wall S3 was the most variable.  

Figure431Apr816,2013HFdataforwallsS2,S3,S4andS5­ cavitydata(Top)andstuddata(Bottom)

Table  410  compares  the  Uvalues  determined  from  the  material  properties  with  the  HF  sensor  data  collected  from  test  walls  S2,  S3,  S4  and  S5  during  the  four  analysis  periods.  The  material  property  U value for the S2 (*) stud was determined using a THERM simulation to account for the geometry of the I Joist and size of the HF sensor. The HF sensor data collected during the April 9th to 14th period were used  for  the  calculated  stud  Uvalues  because  data  from  the  additional  stud  T  sensors  were  available  for  this  period.   The  percentage  difference  between  the  two  Uvalue  estimations  indicates  that  the  poorest  agreement  occurred  with  test  panel  S4.  The  extremely  low  Uvalue  in  the  earliest  data  suggested  that  there  was  a  problem  with  the  location  of  the  sensor  ­  this  led  to  the  reinstallation  of  the  sensor  on  the  back  of  the  drywall  to  ensure  good  contact.  The  subsequent  data  however,  still  indicate  that  the  heat  flux  was  substantially lower than expected. This deviation from the predicted value may be a result of convection  89   

  within  the  air  space  between  the  foam  and  the  drywall  since  the  spray  foam  did  not  completely  fill  the  stud cavity.

The Uvalues calculated using the sensor data in S2 may also have been influenced by convection within  the  air  layer  created  by  the  interior  strapping  that  was  used  to  hold  the  air  permeable  membrane  in  place  (Figure  36).  Any  convection  within  the  interior  S2  air  layer  however,  would  have  been  limited  by  the  horizontal  strapping  placed  at  0.4  m  vertical  intervals  as  opposed  the  vertical  air  space  in  S4  that  spanned  the  height  of  the  cavity.  This  restricted  convection  within  the  interior  air  layer  may  have

contributed to the lower error for the S2 Uvalue calculations.   The  calculated  stud  and  cavity  Uvalues  for  S2,  S4  and  S5  are  presented  in  Figure  432,  Figure  433,  and  Figure  434.  The  S3  HF  data  is  included  in  each  figure  for  comparison.  These  Uvalues  were  determined  from  data  averages  calculated  from  a  time  subset  within  each  analysis  interval  as  shown  by  the  vertical  lines  in  Figure  431  (Apr  10th  to  14th).  This  smaller  subset  interval  was  used  to  filter  the  extreme  highs  and  lows  of  the  calculated  Uvalues.  The  data  averages  for  each  wall  (stud  and  cavity)  were  calculated  using  the  same  time  subset  and  these  subset  averages  are  included  with  the  Uvalue  curves  as  straight dashed  lines  to  indicate  the  degree  of  fit  with  the  calculated  Uvalues  as  well  as  visually  represent  the  error associated with this type of analysis. The continuous Uvalue data are represented by the solidline  curves.   The  Uvalue  data  shown  in  Figure  432  compare  the  thermal  performance  of  the  S2  IJoist  wall  and  the  S3 datum wall from April 10th to 14th, 2013 during near steady state conditions. The S2 cavity data shows  that while the calculated S2 cavity Uvalue was lower than the calculated Uvalue for S3, the S2 cavity U

Figure434ComparisonofcalculatedUvaluesforwallsS5andS3­ cavity(Top)andstud(Bottom)

value was slightly more variable on April 12th and 13th.. This increased variability possibly arose from the  higher moisture content of the cellulose insulation in S2 relative to the cavity insulation of S3. The higher  outward  heat  flux  between  April  14th  and  15th  coincided  with  condensation  at  the  middle  OSB  MC sensor location in S2.The data do not indicate any condensation in the datum wall S3 during this analysis  period.  The  heat  flux  through  the  S2  cavity  implies  a  thermal  conductivity  of  the  dense  pack  cellulose  of  approximately  0.039  W/  m  K  as  opposed  to  the  value  of  0.042  W/m  K  used  in  the  material  property  calculations.  Further,  this  suggests  that  the  IJoist  wall  cavity  had  a  thermal  resistance  of  6.8  RSI  rather  than the 6.4 RSI calculated using for the higher thermal conductivity. A thermal conductivity of 0.039 W/  m  K  for  the  cellulose  insulation  falls  at  the  bottom  end  of  the  range  cited  in  ASHRAE  (2009)  of  0.039  to  0.045  W/  m  K  for  cellulose  packed  between  35  and  50  kg/m3.  The  thermal  conductivity  of  cellulose  also  varies with temperature, which may have affected these results.   The  calculated  Uvalues  shown  in  Figure  433  compare  the  thermal  performance  of  the  S4  ccSPF  wall  with the S3 datum from April 9th to 14th, 2013. The S4 cavity heat flux was very stable during this period,  which  allowed  for  a  relatively  precise  estimation  of  the  Uvalue.  However,  this  extremely  low  Uvalue  92   

  indicated  that  the  data  were  most  likely  compromised  by  the  air  layer  between  the  foam  insulation  and  the  drywall.  This  calculated  Uvalue  implied  a  thermal  conductivity  of  approximately  0.015  W/  mK  as  opposed to the 0.024 W/m K used in the material property calculations. This value is too low to be valid.  The  calculated  Uvalue  data  shown  in  Figure  434    compare  the  thermal  performance  of  the  S5  polyisocyanurate  wall  with  the  S3  datum  during  the  April  9th  to  14th,  2013  time  interval.  The  S5  cavity  and  stud  heat  flux  were  both  relatively  stable  during  this  period,  which  allowed  for  a  reasonable  estimation  of  the  S5  Uvalues.  As  shown  in  Table  410,  the  S5  cavity  Uvalue  had  an  error  only  7%  while  the stud Uvalue had a 16% error.   The  errors  associated  with  the  stud  Uvalues  were  larger  because  of  the  higher  heat  flux  through  the  framing  portions  of  the  test  panels  and  the  influence  of  the  adjoining  cavity  insulation.  Placing  the  sensors  on  the  north  facing  exposures  would  minimize  the  higher  heat  fluxes  arising  from  solar  gains  and would produce more stable heat flux data.   .

5 HYGROTHERMAL MODELING
Hygrothermal  simulations  of  the  High  RSI  test  walls  were  created  to  examine  the  interactions  between  climatic  conditions,  material  properties,  electrical  sensor  measurement,  and  the  impact  of  simulated  air  leakage.  The  computer  program  WUFI®  Pro  5.2  was  used  to  create  simulation  models  for  the  exterior  insulated  and  deepcavity  cellulose  insulation  High  RSI  walls  as  well  as  the  datum  walls.  The  simulation  models  were  calibrated  using  the  measured  data  recorded  between  October  4,  2012  and  June  3,  2013.  During  the  calibration  process,  seasonal  variations  of  the  surface  heattransfer  coefficients  were  investigated  and  their  effects  on  the  temperature  and  relative  humidity  regimes  within  the  assembly  were  examined.  The  simulation  models  used  in  this  study  were  configured  with  multiple  layers  within  the OSB sheathing, cavity insulation and the exterior drainage space to facilitate the investigation.   The aim of this study was to explore the key parameters that influenced the moisture transport through  the  High  RSI  wall  assemblies  and  create  reliable  simulation  models  that  could  be  used  to  study  the  performance  of  these  walls  using  a  variety  of  climatic  conditions.  The  calibration  process  was  primarily  concerned  with  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  that  control  the  interactions  between  the  simulation  model and the boundary conditions. These surface transfer coefficients are:      Short wave absorptivity ­   Ground shortwave reflectivity or albedo ( GSWR)     Cloud index (CI)  Surface film heat resistances (convective and radiative heat exchange)  o Wind effects 

The  heat  and  moisture  transport  through  the  wall  assemblies  was  also  determined  by  the  material  properties of the various wall components. The thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability had  significant  influences  on  the  rates  that  heat  and  moisture  flowed  through  the  assembly;  however,  the  sorption  isotherms  (moisture  storage  functions)  of  the  hygroscopic  woodbased  materials  had  a  more  profound effect on the amount of water vapour retained within the assembly.   The  boundary  conditions  (interior  and  exterior  climates)  were  also  important  factors  determining  the  calibration  of  the  simulation  models  since  these  data  represented  the  heat  and  moisture  loads  present  throughout  the  study  period.  A  precise  representation  of  the  environmental  loading  was  necessary  in  order  to  minimize  compounding  errors  in  the  surface  transfer  coefficients.  As  an  example,  the  heating  94   

  effects  related  to  the  short  wave  absorptivity  coefficient  were  determined  by  the  amount  of  direct  radiation as well as the reflected radiation arising from the albedo of the ground surface.   The  configuration  of  the  hygrothermal  model  was  designed  to  facilitate  these  investigations  as  well  as  provide solutions to the inaccuracies caused by rigid coefficients that were used to define variables such  as  cloud  index  and  albedo  as  well  as  cavity  ventilation.  The  twolayer  exterior  cavity  was  developed  to  minimize  the  effects  of  excessive  ventilation  on  model  fidelity.  Once  the  temperature  and  relative  humidity of the wall cavities and sheathing were calibrated with measured data, the material properties  of the OSB sheathing were examined.   The  deep  cavity  celluloseinsulated  walls  were  investigated  in  detail  since  these  walls  had  the  largest  number of moisture related issues. The exaggerated vertical MC profiles of N1, S1, and N2 in contrast to  the  uniform  moisture  distribution  of  S2  required  explanation.  Although  these  walls  were  similar  in  concept  and  materials,  the  Type  2  wall  had  a  central  cavity  wallarea  similar  to  the  datum  and  exterior  insulated  walls,  while  the  wallarea  of  the  central  cavity  in  the  Type  1  (double  ­stud)  walls  was  connected  to  its  side  cavities  through  the  57  mm  space  between  the  inner  and  outer  framing.  The  influence of the wall geometry was considered as well as the material properties.  The  investigation  process  began  with  the  calibration  the  datum  walls.  The  datum  walls  were  calibrated  first  based  on  siding  and  OSB  temperature  as  well  as  relative  humidity  at  the  midheight  sensor  locations,  because  of  the  similarities  between  the  datum  walls  and  the  High  RSI  walls.  The  midheight  sensor  locations  were  the  most  hygrothermally  isolated  from  the  temperature  and  hygroscopic  effects  of  the  upper  and  lower  plates.  In  addition,  the  temperatures  of  the  midheight  sensors  were  not  noticeably affected by the air leakage test.  

5.1 Approach
The  north  and  south  facing  datum  wall  models  were  first  calibrated  with  the  measured  temperature  data  of  the  exterior  cladding  and  OSB  sheathing.  Once  the  correlations  between  these  measured  and  simulated temperatures were optimized, the relative humidity of the exterior cavity was calibrated using  the  Air  Change  Rate  (ACR).  Changes  to  the  exterior  cavity  ACR  had  a  greater  influence  on  the  relative  humidity  of  the  cavity  than  the  temperature  of  the  cavity.  The  relative  humidity  of  the  exterior  cavity  subsequently  influenced  the  moisture  content  of  the  OSB  sheathing  because  the  sheathing's 

95   

  hygroscopic  (RH  dependent)  properties.  The  moisture  storage  function  (MSF)  and  water  vapour  diffusion resistance (WVDR) of the OSB were both dependent on the RH of the adjoining air space(s).   The  interior  cavity  RH  was  more  difficult  to  calibrate  as  the  RH  within  the  cavity  was  influenced  by  the  hygroscopic  materials  that  enclosed  the  cavity.  The  studs  and  plates  bounding  the  cavity  influenced  the  measured  RH  data  by  acting  as  either  sources  or  sinks  depending  on  the  boundary  conditions.  The  WUFI®  models  could  not  fully  represent  these  interactions,  which  resulted  in  lower  correlations  between  the  model  and  measured  data.  The  main  objective  for  the  interior  cavity  RH  of  the  model  data  was to achieve an average daily RH that was similar to the measured data rather than try to replicate the  daily fluctuations.  Once  the  calibrations  of  temperature  and  humidity  were  optimized,  further  correction  of  the  model  data  was  achieved  through  modifying  the  material  parameters  of  the  OSB  sheathing.  The  OSB  material  properties  of  moisture  storage  function  (MSF)  and  water  vapour  diffusion  resistance  (WVDR)  factor  were obtained from the National Research Council of Canada report NRCC46090 (Kumaran et al, 2003).  These  sorption  and  desorption  EMC  data  were  reported  as  averages  along  with  their  standard  deviations.  The  water  vapour  resistance  factors  for  OSB  were  also  reported  as  minimum  and  maximum  data  values.  These  ranges  of  OSB  material  properties  were  used  to  define  several  OSB  material  definitions  within  the  WUFI®  material  database  to  examine  the  effect  of  these  properties  on  OSB  moisture  content.  Separate  material  definitions  were  created  to  encompass  the  data  range  using  low,  average,  and  high  values  from  the  MSF  and  the  WVDR  factor  datasets  reported  by  NRCC46090  (Kumaran et al, 2003).  Through successive model simulations, the most appropriate material values were selected. The average  density  of  650  kg/m3  was  used  for  each  of  the  material  property  definitions  as  the  effect  of  density  on  temperature,  MC  and  RH  did  not  appear  to  be  significant  at  an  hourly  timestep  resolution.  The  MSF,  however, had a substantial impact on the calculated OSB MC within the models because it governed the  amount  of  water  vapour  adsorbed  by  the  OSB  at  specific  RH  levels.  This  fact  further  emphasized  the  importance of calibrating the RH levels within the interior and exterior cavities.  

5.1.1 Cellulose moisture content
The High RSI test walls were categorized as either deep cavity or conventional construction with exterior  insulation.  The  two  celluloseinsulated  deepcavity  wall  types  were  investigated  in  this  simulation  study  to  determine  the  cause  of  the  wideranges  of  OSB  and  plate  moisture  content  responses  recorded  96   

  during  the  study  period.  The  performance  of  the  southfacing  IJoist  wall,  S2,  far  exceeded  that  of  the  other  three  celluloseinsulated  walls.  The  S2  wall  was  the  only  celluloseinsulated  wall  that  had  a  uniform  vertical  OSB  MC  profile.  The  remaining  celluloseinsulated  walls  had  widely  varying  vertical  MC  profiles. To assess these four walls, calibrated WUFI® models were created to investigate  the role of the  initial moisture content of the cellulose on the performance of these deep cavity walls.   Prior  analyses  of  the  measured  data  indicated  that  the  nonuniform  vertical  OSB  MC  profiles  in  wall  types  1  and  2  were  linked  to  the  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose.  Using  the  surface  transfer  coefficients and model design developed through calibration with the datum walls, the moisture content  profiles  in  wall  types  1  and  2  were  examined  using  WUFI®  to  determine  the  initial  cellulose  moisture  content.   Further  model  studies  should  include  an  assessment  of  initial  moisture  content  based  on  orientation,  geographic location and building application.  

5.1.2 Material properties
The WUFI® model calibrations began with research into the material properties of each wall component.  The  most  significant  wall  components  in  each  wall  were  the  insulation  materials  and  the  OSB.  The  hygroscopic properties (moisture storage function and water vapour diffusion resistance factor (WVDR))  of  each  material  were  of  particular  importance  because  these  parameters  controlled  the  amount  of  moisture  that  was  stored  in  each  assembly  as  well  as  the  moisture  transport  rate.  The  material  properties of the wall assembly components were obtained from the following sources:

  The  material  properties  obtained  from  the  NRCC  50287  report  for  the  cladding  were  not  specifically  related  to  the  siding  product  used  in  the  wall  assemblies.  Rather,  the  material  properties  reported  in  NRCC50287  were  derived  from  fibre  cement  sheathing  board  and  although  these  two  components  were  made  from  the  same  material,  qualitative  observations  indicated  that  because  of  the  finishing  treatments  on  the  siding,  it  was  less  absorptive  and  tended  to  shed  water  better  than  the  sheathing  product.  The  bakedon  finish  of  the  siding  probably  lowered  the  sorption  potential  of  the  exterior  face  by  affecting  the  capillary  suction  characteristics,  which  in  turn  would  lower  the  moisture  storage  function. This uncertainty was investigated and discussed in Section 5.3.5.   In  addition,  the  lapped  nature  of  the  siding  diminished  the  reliability  of  the  water  vapour  permeance  since  airflow  between  the  siding  boards  was  unrestricted.  For  this  reason,  the  water  vapour  calibration  of  the  exterior  cavity  occurred  primarily  through  the  air  change  rate  used  for  ventilation.  The  hygroscopic  properties  and  water  vapour  permeability  of  this  type  of  siding  product  should  be  determined in order to remove these uncertainties from future analyses.  

5.2 WUFI® model configuration
The  hygrothermal  models  were  configured  to  enable  the  investigation  of  the  various  wall  components  and  their  interactions  with  environmental  and  induced  moisture  loads.  The  model  configuration  for  the  Type 3 Datum wall is presented in Figure 51 to illustrate how the wall assembly was modeled in WUFI®.  The  left  edge  of  the  figure  represents  the  exterior  of  the  model  with  the  fibrecement  siding,  air  space  and water resistive barrier (WRB) comprising the drainedscreened exterior.   The 18.5 mm air layer was divided into two 9.25 mm layers with the outermost layer ventilated with the  exterior  air  of  the  climate  file  at  a  constant  rate  of  210  ACH.  This  layer  was  separated  to  minimize  the  overcooling  /  overheating  that  occurred  with  the  single  airlayer  and  a  constant  ventilation  rate.  Since  the exteriorcavity ventilation rate was defined in the model using a constantvalue instead of a variable  ­  determined  by  solar  radiation,  wind,  and/or  air  pressure  ­  the  double  airlayer  minimized  the  temperature  effects  that  occurred  when  the  ventilation  rate  was  either  too  high  or  too  low.  The  detrimental effects of the single airlayer were most noticeable on clear days and nights.   By  splitting  the  exterior  drainage  space  airlayer  into  two  components  and  applying  all  of  the  cavity  ventilation to the outmost layer, the cavity air was allowed to exchange with the outside air and balance  moisture across the cladding. The innermost layer of the exterior cavity provided a relative humidity and  98   

 

Figure51TypicalWUFI®modelconfiguration

temperature  buffer  for  the  OSB  during  periods  when  the  defined  ACR  rate  was  too  high.  The  calibration  of  the  exterior  cavity  relative  humidity  was  important  because  the  water  vapour  permeance  (WVDR  factor)  and  moisture  storage  function  (MSF)  of  the  sheathing  changed  with  the  relative  humidity  of  the  cavity air.   The  base  hygrothermal  WUFI®  model  was  designed  to  investigate  the  variations  in  MC  within  the  OSB  throughout the High RSI study period. The OSB sheathing layer was initially divided into three sections of  3.0,  5.1,  and  3.0  mm  to  observe  the  moisture  content  profile  through  the  OSB.  This  layered  OSB  approach  also  allowed  the  sensing  depth  of  the  OSB  MC  pins  to  be  investigated.  To  further  the  investigation  of  the  MC  sensors,  the  inner  3.0  mm  layer  was  subdivided  into  two  sections  of  1.9  mm  and  1.1  mm.  The  innermost  1.1  mm  layer  was  added  as  an  aid  to  determine  the  changes  (if  any)  in  the  sensing  depth  of  the  MC  sensors  under  varying  moisture  loads.  The  moisture  sensorpins  were  installed  to a total depth of 5 mm as described in Section 3.6.4.

5.2.1 Simulation of air leakage
During  the  air  leakage  test,  the  airflow  distribution  within  the  stud  cavity  was  determined  by  the  cross sectional  area  and  the  airpermeability  of  the  insulation  in  the  cavity.  The  moisture  load  of  the  air  column  depended  on  the  initial  moisture  load  of  the  interior  air,  the  temperature  /  moisture  profile  across  the  wall  as  well  as  along  the  vertical  path  within  the  stud  cavity.  In  order  to  facilitate  the  simulation  of  this  hygrothermal  system,  the  insulation  cavity  was  divided  into  four  layers  that  allowed  the  1  mm  Air  Change  Layer  (ACL)  to  be  placed  at  different  locations  within  the  stud  cavity.  This  accommodation was provided to observe the effect that the placement of the 1 mm ACL had on the OSB  moisture  content.  The  ACL  placement  had  the  most  significant  effects  in  the  deepcavity  cellulose  insulated  walls  because  the  moisture  storage  of  the  cellulose  delayed  the  transport  of  moisture  across  the  assembly.  The  segmented  stud  cavity  shown  in  Figure  51  also  permitted  the  use  of  multiple  ACL  layers  to  simulate  dispersed  paths  through  the  stud  cavity  with  variable  ACRs.  The  air  leakage  simulations are presented in Section 5.7.  

5.3 Model calibration
The  data  collected  from  the  midheight  sensors  (Figure  34)  were  used  to  calibrate  the  hygrothermal  models  to  the  boundary  conditions  and  determine  the  appropriate  material  parameters  for  the  OSB  sheathing.  The  datum  walls  were  chosen  for  the  calibration  study  because  these  walls  contained  the  same  exterior  control  layers  as  each  of  the  High  RSI  test  walls.  The  datum  walls  also  had  the  same  basic  framing  and  sheathing  configuration  as  the  exterior  insulated  wall  types.  Once  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  and  common  material  properties  were  determined,  then  the  cellulose  and  exterior  insulation  components  were  examined  individually  for  each  of  the  High  RSI  walls  (Types  1,  2,  57).  The  measured data used to calibrate the WUFI® models were:      Exterior temperature,  Exterior cavity RH,  OSB temperature, and    Stud cavity RH  

These  datasets  were  compared  with  corresponding  WUFI®  output  to  determine  the  bestfit  settings  for  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  and  model  configuration.  The  surface  transfer  coefficients  defined  for  the  WUFI®  simulation  models  determined  the  heat  transfer  rate  between  model  and  the  climate  data  (boundary conditions).   100   

  The principal external coefficients used to calibrate the models were:      Winddependent heat resistance  Shortwave radiation absorptivity, (sw)  Explicit radiation balance  o Cloud index 

Ground shortwave reflectivity 

These  heat  transfer  coefficients  are  discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  following  sections.  The  adhering  fraction  of  rain  was  also  investigated  to  determine  its  effect  on  OSB  MC  via  the  exterior  cavity  RH  levels  (Section 5.3.5).  

5.3.1 Wind dependent heat resistance
Heat  transfer  at  exterior  surfaces  is  determined  by  the  convective  and  radiative  heat  transfer  coefficients  that  represent  the  rates  at  which  heat  is  exchanged  through  convection  and  longwave  (thermal)  radiation.  The  combined  effects  of  these  coefficients  are  often  referred  to  as  surface  film  coefficients  (Straube  et  al,  2005).  Factors  like  the  direction  and  magnitude  of  wind  can  alter  the  heat  transfer  rate  between  the  assembly  and  its  surroundings.  WUFI®  compensates  for  these  windrelated  effects by including a wind dependent heat transfer coefficient  that adjusts the  value of the surface film  based  on  the  orientation  of  the  exterior  surface  relative  to  the  wind  direction  ­  leeward  or  windward.  The values used by WUFI® to determine the exterior surface heat resistance are (WUFI®, 2012):    Convective heat transfer coefficient = 4.50 W/m2K (wind velocity = 0 m/s)  Radiation heat transfer coefficient = 6.5 W/m2K  

For wind dependence, WUFI® weights the wind speed based on its direction relative to the building face  using:     0.33 * Wind velocity (leeward conditions)   1.6 * Wind velocity (windward conditions)  

The  variability  of  these  surface  coefficients  is  shown  in  Figure  52  below  for  both  the  north  and  south  facing  walls  during  the  period  of  November  13th  to  24th,  2012.  This  figure  shows  the  variation  in  the  value  of  the  convective  component  of  the  surface  heattransfer  coefficient  as  the  north  and  south  orientations alternate between leeward to windward conditions. The higher thermal conductance of the

south  facing  walls  figure  indicates  that  the  south  facing  wall  experienced  windward  conditions  for  the  majority of the time, which resulted in a higher thermal conductance.   Comparative  model  simulations  indicated  that  the  peak  (daytime  high)  cladding  temperatures  were  consistently  lower  with  the  wind  dependence  option  disabled.  Peak  temperature  differences  of  up  to  10°C were observed between the model and measured data on sunny days throughout the study period.  Figure 53 presents a data comparison between the  measure S3 siding temperature data and simulation  data that was calculated with and without the winddependent heat resistance option enabled.   Figure  53  indicates  that  using  the  winddependent  heat  transfer  improved  the  correlation  between  the  simulated  and  measured  data  the  most  during  clear,  sunny  days.  The  winddependent  heat  resistance  option did not have an observable effect on the nighttime siding temperature and only a slight effect on  siding temperature during cloudy days (see Nov 19 data in Figure 53).   With  the  wind  dependence  option  disabled,  the  calculated  cladding  temperatures  were  much  lower  because  WUFI®  used  the  full  wind  velocity  during  these  timesteps.  When  the  winddependent  option  was  enabled,  the  simulated  cladding  temperatures  were  determined  using  leeward  wind  velocities  that  resulted in a better correlation between the measured and simulated siding temperatures. The effect of  wind  direction  had  very  little  effect  on  the  correlation  between  the  measured  and  simulated  siding  temperatures of the northfacing walls.

5.3.2 Short-wave radiation absorptivity
The solar absorption coefficient (sw) had the largest influence on cladding temperature and its value is a  function of the cladding's colour. The  manufacturer's colour designation for the fibrecement siding was  Antique  White,  which  resembled  a  very  light  tan  (buff)  colour  more  than  white.  Typical  absorptivity  coefficients  for  white  to  light  cream  surfaces  range  from  0.3  to  0.5  while  yellow  to  buff  building  materials  range  from  0.5  to  0.7  (Hutcheon  and  Handegord,  1995).  The  sw value  of  0.60  was  determined  using  the  southfacing  datum  wall  and  incremental  changes  to  the  swvalue  until  the  peak  daytime  cladding  temperatures  of  the  simulations  were  consistently  within  12°C  of 
Figure54Testwallcladdingcolour

the  measured data.  The  swvalue of 0.60 was  used  for  each  of  the  High  RSI  test  walls  on 

both  the  north  and  southfacing  simulations.  The  cladding  colour  is  shown  in  Figure  54  relative  to  the  dark  red  siding  of  the  BEG  Hut  and  the  bright  aluminum  flashing  covering  the  top  of  the  test  panels.  For  comparison, the absorptivity of highly polished aluminum, chrome, nickel and tine range from 0.1 to 0.4  and from 0.65 to 0.8 for dark red brick and dark paints (Hutcheon and Handegord, 1995).   The  cladding's  solar  absorptivity  value  was  determined  using  several  trial  simulations  and  varying  sw  values.  The  sw  values  were  varied  between  0.4  and  0.7  to  determine  the  sw  value  that  most  closely 

103   

 

Figure55ComparativeTanalysistodeterminetheshortwaveabsorptivitycoefficientofthecladdingusingthe datumwalls(T=Tmeasured­Tsimulated)

simulated  the  cladding  temperature  during  the  day.  The  differences  between  the  measured  and  simulated  daytime  cladding  temperatures  (for  each  timestep)  were  averaged  to  determine  a  single,  representative T performancevalue for the analysis periods from October 4th to January 1st, January 1st  to  April  1st,  and  April  1st  to  August  2nd.  These  performance  values  are  presented  in  Figure  55  for  the  south and northfacing walls.   The  shortwave  absorptivity  value  was  determined  from  the  south  facing  wall  analysis  since  it  was  most  affected  by  direct  solar  radiation.  This  analysis  indicates  that  the  sw  value  =  0.60  approximated  the  measured  data  the  best  throughout  the  study  period.  Weightedaverage  Tvalues  for  each  sw  increment  were  also  calculated  by  time  weighting  the  average  Tvalues  from  each  of  the  analysis  intervals. These values are also included in Figure 55.  

104   

  The  cladding  temperatures  of  wall  Types  2,  3,  and  6  (IJoist,  Datum,  and  XPS)  are  compared  with  their  corresponding  measured  cladding  temperatures  in  Figure  56  and  Figure  57.  The  time  intervals  November 7th to 16th and June 17th to 24th were selected as they represent data collected during periods  of  low  and  high  peaksolar  angles  respectively.  The  simulated  temperatures  were  calculated  using  sw=0.60.  As  these  figures  show,  the  simulations  performed  using  s=  0.60  closely  approximated  the  daytime  and  peak  cladding  temperatures  for  each  of  these  three  wall  types.  The  simulated  and  measured  temperatures  were  generally  well  correlated  for  each  day  with  some  minor  error  resulting  from  the 

Figure56Claddingtemperaturecorrelationforsw =0.60forwallTypes2,3,and6(Nov716/2013)

105   

  hourly  averaging  of  the  data.  Other  sources  of  error  arose  from  the  calculation  of  diffuse  and  direct  radiation,  variations  in  wind  speed  and  direction,  as  well  as  the  seasonal  variability  in  ground  albedo  (reflectivity)  and  cloud  cover  (cloud  index).  The  cladding  sw  value  was  considered  constant  throughout  the  data  acquisition  period,  which  ignored  the  negligible  changes  due  to  dust  and  fading  from  UV  radiation.   Unlike  the  sw  value,  cloud  cover  varied  daily  and  the  ground  albedo  changed  seasonally.  Both  of  these  parameters  were  defined  using  constant  values  that  were  approximated  to  minimize  errors  and  "best fit"  the  climatic  conditions  at  the  BEG  Hut  during  the  study  period.  Subsequently,  nighttime

106   

  temperatures  and  the  daily  temperature  profiles  were  slightly  varied  between  the  two  datasets.  The  cloud index and ground shortwave reflectivity coefficients are discussed in the following sections, while  the influence of wind speed and direction were discussed in the preceding section.   The  northfacing  temperature  comparisons  for  the  Datum  wall  N3  using  sw  =0.60  are  shown  in  Figure  58.  The  measured  and  simulated  temperature  datasets  were  well  correlated  throughout  the  study  period  with  the  most  deviation  occurring  during  the  winter  (as  shown  in  Figure  55).  These  deviations  were  most  likely  related  to  the  change  in  the  ground's  albedo  resulting  from  snow  cover.  Snow  cover  at 

Figure58CladdingtemperaturecomparisonofthenorthDatumwallN3usingsw =0.60

the  BEG  Hut  location  was  only  consistent  between  midJanuary  and  midMarch.  The  northfacing  cladding temperatures were also as well correlated as the southfacing wall data.   The  calculated  and  measured  OSB  temperatures  were  also  well  correlated  for  both  of  the  north  and  southfacing  walls.  Further  analysis  of  the  exterior  insulated  wall  models  indicated  that  these  calculated  sheathing  temperature  data  also  closely  approximated  the  measured  OSB  sheathing  temperatures  in  wall Types 57.

5.3.3 Explicit radiation balance
The  explicit  radiation  balance  option  was  used  to  simulate  the  daily  longwave  radiation  exchange  between  the  test  wall  and  its  surroundings  so  that  nighttime  radiant  losses  could  be  accurately  determined.  Radiant  energy  loss  to  the  night  sky  occurs  because  the  gasses  in  the  atmosphere  only  reradiate  long  wave  radiation  in  certain  wavelengths  coincident  with  their  energy  states  rather  than  across  the  spectrum  like  opaque  materials  (Hutcheon  and  Handegord,  1995).  In  the  absence  of  cloud  cover,  radiant  energy  is  lost  from  building  surfaces  which  results  in  cladding  temperatures  that  fall  below  the  ambient  air  temperature.  This  overcooling  occurs  only  at  night  when  it  is  not  counter balanced by incoming solar radiation.   The  amount  of  radiant  energy  loss  that  occurs  on  any  given  day  is  determined  by  the  location's  cloud  cover.  A  cloud  index  (CI)  represents  this  cloud  cover  and  if  recorded,  a  continuous  cloud  index  can  be  included  in  the  boundary  conditions  via  the  exterior  climate  file.  In  the  absence  of  a  continuous  cloud  cover  index,  a  typical  CIvalue  must  be  estimated  to  represent  the  average  amount  of  nighttime  cooling  expected  at  the  study  location.  This  constant  CIvalue  was  optimized  using  the  nighttime  data  when  the  effects  of  cloud  cover  could  be  isolated  from  incoming  solar  radiation  ­  direct,  diffuse,  and  reflected.  The  optimization  was  achieved  by  calculating  the  difference  between  the  nighttime  cladding  temperatures  (measured  ­  simulated)  using  a  series  of  cloud  index  values  from  0.4  to  0.9.  These  cloud  index  values  were  repeated  for  three  sw  values  from  0.55,  0.58  and  0.60.  The  averages  of  these  data  were calculated and plotted to reveal the linear relationship, shown in Figure 59.   Comparative modeling analysis determined that the optimized cloud index coefficients were 0.58 for the  southfacing  walls  and  0.65  for  the  northfacing  walls.  The  differences  between  these  two  CIvalues  resulted  from  variations  in  areal  exposure  to  the  nightsky  as  well  as  orientation  to  the  wind.

108   

  Additionally,  variations  in  the  ground  longwave  (thermal)  emissivity  and  reflectivity  may  have  contributed  to  the  difference  between  the  CIvalues.  The  default  values  of  0.9  and  0.1  were  used  for  these  thermal  coefficients,  respectively.  The  difference  between  the  daily  temperature  profiles  of  the  simulated  and  measured  data  occasionally  varied  by  34°C  for  several  hours  during  very  clear  nights  when  the  actual  cloud  cover  was  substantially  below  that  predicted  by  the  0.58  or  0.65  CIvalues.  Generally,  however,  the  differences  between  the  measured  and  simulated  overnight  cladding  temperatures were less than 2°C.  

5.3.4 Ground short-wave reflectivity
The  ground  shortwave  reflectivity  (GSWR)  coefficient  was  used  to  define  the  amount  of  solar  radiation  reflected from the ground to the exterior surface of the wall. The ground reflectivity is otherwise known  as  albedo  and  its  value  changed  seasonally  at  the  BEG  Hut  depending  on  the  grass  colour  (brown  or  green) and snow cover.   WUFI®  has  several  predefined  coefficient  values  and  the  value  of  0.26  (green  grass)  proved  to  provide  satisfactory  year  round  cladding  temperatures  for  the  southfacing  simulations.  However,  the  cladding  temperatures  of  the  northfacing  simulations  were  often  overheated  during  periods  of  highangle  and  high  intensity  radiation.  The  combination  of  more  intense  radiation  and  an  overestimation  of  the  backscatter associated with high angle sunlight caused disproportionately high cladding temperatures in  the north facing simulations during the April to August period.   Comparative  models  were  created  to  determine  the  seasonal  variation  and  optimal  value  for  the  ground's  shortwave  reflectivity.  North  and  south  orientations  of  these  models  were  simulated  using  reflectivity values ranging from 0.0 to 0.40. The results were analysed using the differences between the  daytime  cladding  temperatures  [Measured  ­  Simulated].  Averages  for  these  datasets  were  determined  on  a  seasonal  basis  and  the  plotted  to  illustrate  the  effect  of  the  varying  albedos.  The  magnitude  of  these  values  was  affected  by  the  shortwave  absorptivity,  cloud  index,  and  winddependent  heat  resistance.  For  this  reason,  the  primary  focus  of  this  section  was  to  determine  suitable  ranges  for  the  GSWR  values  and  to  observe  the  seasonal  influence  of  albedo.  Negative  values  indicated  that  the  simulated temperatures were higher than the measured data.  The  averages  calculated  from  the  northfacing  temperature  differences  are  shown  in  Figure  510.  These  data  illustrate  the  exaggerated  effect  of  higher  albedo  values  on  the  cladding  temperatures  during  April  to  August.  While  higher  reflectivity  values  better  approximated  the  measured  data  during  fall  and  109

winter,  its  effect  during  the  April  to  August  period  was  disproportionately  higher.  Although  these  average  temperature  changes  were  minor,  the  cumulative  effect  on  moisture  content  was  significant  and led to overestimations of drying potential in the  simulations of the High RSI wall during the April to  August period.  The data presented in Figure 510 indicate that for the northfacing simulations, a GSWR between 0 and  0.1  was  best  since  GSWR  values  above  0.1  disproportionately  affect  the  spring  and  summer  cladding  temperatures.  The  value  of  the  GSWR  coefficient  varied  with  application  but  in  general,  the  0.26  value  was  used  for  the  air  injection  test  and  baseline  model  calibration.  For  data  analysis  after  April,  0  or  0.1  was used where appropriate.   The average cladding Tdata calculated from the southfacing simulations are presented in Figure 511.  These  data  indicate  that  reflectivity  values  between  0.20  and  0.26  provided  the  best  seasonal

  approximations  of  the  measured  data.  The  simulated  cladding  temperatures  were  least  affected  by  changes  to  the  reflectivity  coefficient  during  the  fall  period  and  most  affected  during  the  spring  and  summer.  The  wintertime  albedo  was  very  well  approximated  with  0.30.  The  GSWR  value  used  in  the  south facing simulations was 0.26.  

5.3.5 Adhering fraction of rain
The  adhering  fraction  of  rain  (AFR)  option,  previously  known  as  the  rain  reduction  factor  or  rainwater  absorption  factor,  was  used  to  define  the  amount  of  water  that  adhered  to  the  exterior  surface  of  the  cladding.  This  adhered  rainwater  was  available  for  capillary  suction  during  and  after  rainfall  events.  In  light  of  the  uncertainties  with  respect  to  the  material  properties  of  the  fibre  cement  siding,  the  AFR  setting  was  investigated  by  observing  the  results  of  two  simulations  that  were  performed  with  the  AFR  enabled and then disabled. All other surface transfer coefficients were held constant between these two  simulations  and  the  default  AFR  setting  of  0.70  was  used  when  the  setting  was  enabled.  The  cavity  ventilation was set for 200 ACH.  The effects of the AFR function were investigated because the absorption of water into the cladding can  increase  the  vapour  pressure  within  the  exterior  cavity.  Changes  to  the  vapour  pressure  profile  affect  the wall's drying potential directly through the magnitude of the vapour drive and indirectly through the  WVDR  and  MSF  of  the  OSB  sheathing.  Since  the  OSB  sheathing  is  hygroscopic,  its  moisture  content  and  water  vapour  permeability  depend  on  the  relative  humidity  in  the  adjoining  air  cavities.  Figure  512  shows  the  impact  of  the  AFR  option  on  the  RH  of  the  exterior  cavity  in  the  southfacing  datum  wall  S3.  The  WUFI®  simulated  RH  data  for  the  exterior  cavity  are  compared  with  the  measured  data.  The  rainfall  events are shown at the top of the figure with its inverted scale on the righthand side of the chart. Prior  to  the  first  precipitation  event,  the  two  sets  of  WUFI®  RH  data  were  identical  and  approximated  the 

Figure512EffectoftheAFRoptiononexteriorcavityRHinthesouthdatumwallS3(Nov30toDec16/2012)

111   

  measured  RH  data  relatively  well.  However,  immediately  following  the  rainfall  on  Dec  2,  2012,  the  WUFI®  RH  data  calculated  with  the  AFR  enabled  was  elevated  by  several  percent,  while  the  nonAFR  data  continued  to  track  the  measured  RH  more  closely.  This  pattern  repeated  itself  during  and  after  most rainfall events. The AFR option was disabled for all subsequent modeling.   The  accuracy  of  the  AFR  setting  depended  on  the  cladding's  material  properties.  Material  properties  specific  to  the  fibrecement  siding  product  used  in  the  High  RSI  wall  study  were  not  available  and  were  substituted  with  the  material  specifications  for  fibrecement  sheathing  board.  This  product  had  the  same  density  and  thickness;  however,  the  surface  treatments  of  these  products  varied  based  on  their  intended  applications.  The  properties  for  the  fibrecement  sheathing  board  were  updated  with  MSF  data  from  the  NRCC50287  report  (Mukhopadhyaya,  et  al.,  2007)  to  create  a  custom  material  property  for  the  siding.  The  properties  for  capillary  suction  were  the  same  the  sheathing  board,  which  may  also  be  a  source  of  error  for  this  material.  While  the  fibrecement  sheathing  and  siding  are  the  same  basic  material,  their  surface  treatments  are  different.  It  is  suspected  that  the  siding's  exposed  face  has  lower  capillary  suction  than  the  sheathing  because  of  the  paint  and  embossed  design  applied  to  this  side  for  durability  and  aesthetics.  The  siding's  glossier  finish  probably  limits  the  adherence  and  absorption  of  rain, which precluded the need for the AFR option to account for rain adherence. 

5.3.6 Exterior cavity ventilation
The  exterior  drainedscreened  wall  system  and  its  18.5  mm  air  space  were  common  to  each  of  the  test  panels  in  the  High  RSI  wall  study.  This  exterior  wall  system  was  assembled  using  8  mm  fibre  cement  siding  fastened  to  18.5  mm  (600  mm  OC)  strapping  that  provided  the  air  layer  (drainage  space).  The  lap  joints  between  the  individual  siding  boards  supplied  the  air  layer  with  ventilation.  This  ventilation  was  simulated  in  WUFI®  using  an  Air  Change  Source  and  a  constant  rate  air  exchange  with  the  exterior  boundary  conditions.  Since  the  actual  airchange  rate  varied  throughout  the  study  period,  comparative  models  were  used  to  optimize  the  airchange  rate  of  the  cavity  in  order  to  minimize  error.  The  air change rate  (ACR) was varied between  0 and 400 ACH (0 to 7.4 m3/ hour per  m2) for both  the north and  southfacing  wall  models.  The  WUFI®  models  were  constructed  using  the  datum  wall  configuration,  which  also  included  separate  single  and  double  air  layer  models  to  observe  their  relative  performances.  The  2Layer  air  cavity  exchanged  air  in  the  outermost  layer  only,  which  provided  an  inner  layer  temperature  buffer  for  the  sheathing  during  periods  when  the  constant  air  change  rate  was  too  high.  From  a  modeling  perspective,  excessive  and  insufficient  air  change  of  the  exterior  cavity  is  inevitable  when the ACR is defined by a constant value. This investigation attempted to minimize these errors.   112

The  model  results  were  divided  into  daytime  and  nighttime  intervals  for  analysis.  These  datasets  were  analysed by determining the differences between the measured and simulated RH data (RH = RHmeasured  ­RHsimulated)  for  each  model  timestep.  Median  values  of  these  data  were  calculated  for  each  ACR  during  the  three  analysis  periods  from  October  to  January,  January  to  March,  and  April  to  August.  A  time weighted  average  of  these  three  median RHvalues  produced  a  single RHvalue  for  each  ACR  (from  0  to  400).  These  single RHvalues  were  used  to  observe  the  effect  of  varying  the  exterior  cavity  ACR  by  plotting  a RH  versus  ACH  plots  as  shown  in  Figure  513.  The  daytime RH  data  are  shown  in  the  upper  plot of Figure 513, while the nighttime data are presented in the lower plot. It is important to note that  the  air  change  rate  is  denoted  in  air  changes  per  hour  (ACH)  of  the  single  layer  cavity  volume  ­  the  ACH  for  the  double  layer  was  increased  to  maintain  comparative  volumes  since  only  the  air  in  the  outermost  layer  was  ventilated  with  the  outdoor  air.  All  other  surface  transfer  coefficients  were  held  constant  and  only  the  ACR  of  the  exterior  cavity  was  changed.  The  simulation  RH  data  was  collected  from  an  RH monitor  that  was  positioned  close  (~2mm)  to  the  centre  of  the  exterior  cavity  within  the  innermost  exterior air layer. Detailed RH data are presented in Appendix L. 

113   

  In  general,  the  data  presented  in  Figure  513  show  that  the  different  air  change  rates  influence  the  exterior  cavity  RH  differently  based  on  orientation  and  time  of  day.  The  measured  daytime  RH  data  for  Datum  wall  N3  (blue)  were  best  approximated  by  50  ACH  for  the  1Layer  and  100  ACH  for  the  2Layer  airlayer.  At  night,  the  measured  north  wall  data  were  best  represented  by  no  ventilation  (0  ACH)  for  both  the  1Layer  and  2Layer  models.  Since  the  model  results  for  0  ACH  rapidly  diverged  from  the  daytime  data  (for  both  air  layers),  this  ACR  was  not  suitable.  The  RH  data  from  the  400  ACH  simulation  of the 1Layer model also closely approximated the nighttime measured RH data from N3; however, this  flow rate also diverged from the daytime measured RH data. These data indicated that an exterior cavity  ACR between 100 and 210 ACH best approximated the measured data for the northfacing walls and the  sensitivity to changes in exterior cavity ACR generally decreases below 50 ACH.   The  measured  daytime  RH  data  for  Datum  wall  S3  were  well  approximated  by  simulations  that  used  both  the  single  and  double  air  layer  models  between  100  and  400  ACH.  The  2Layer  simulation  data  calculated  with  a  200  ACH  air  change  rate  gave  the  closest  approximation  by  a  narrow  margin.  The  nighttime  data  were  best  approximated  with  the  2Layer  model  and  an  ACR  of  50  ACH.  Overall,  an  ACR  of either 100 ACH or 210 ACH approximated these measured RH data fairly well.   The  data  curves  in  Figure  513  show  that  the  2  layer  air  cavity  model  had  a  moderating  effect  on  RH  when  higher  ACRs  were  used  in  the  simulations.  For  air  change  rates  between  210  and  400  ACH,  the  differences  between  the  measured  and  simulated  RH  data  were  uniform  in  the  2Layer  dataset,  while  the results diverged in the 1Layer dataset. The twolayer air space was implemented to compensate for  the overmixing of air that occurred at extremes during the day (peak heating) or at night (peak cooling).  The effect of the two layer air cavity is shown in Figure 514 using a comparison of measured N3 RH data  with  model  RH  data  that  was  simulated  using  an  ACR  =  210  ACH  in  both  the  single  and  double  air  layer 

Figure514Relativehumiditycomparisonshowingtheeffectofthe2Layerexterioraircavity

114   

  models.  These  data  show  that  during  some  days,  the  single  air  layer  over  predicted  the  measured  RH  while the twolayer model minimized this overshoot.   The  modeling  results  of  this  exterior  cavity  investigation  indicated  that  an  option  for  a  variable  or  two stage  air  change  rate  would  be  beneficial  in  modeling  the  exterior  cavities  of  drainscreened  wall  assemblies.  A  twostage  air  change  rate  could  specify  separate  nighttime  and  daytime  ACRs  that  would  likely improve the accuracy of modeling results. By reducing the air change rate at night to reflect actual  conditions,  the  cavity  RH  could  be  kept  at  a  more  realistic  level  as  shown  in  Figure  515.  This  figure  compares  simulated  RH  data  using  two  different  ACRs.  The  S3  data  were  recorded  from  November  14 22,  2013  during  a  period  of  clear  sunny  weather  that  caused  welldefined  RH  lows  in  the  exterior  cavity  during  the  day.  The  measured  RH  data  indicated  the  air  change  rate  was  very  low  during  these  nights  since the cavity RH remained suppressed relative to the ambient RH.   Close  examination  of  Figure  515  shows  that  the  simulated  RH  data  calculated  using  an  ACR  =  210  ACH  more  closely  approximated  the  ambient  RH  rather  than  the  measured  RHdata  during  the  nighttime  hours  as  the  cavity  RH  increased  towards  80%  (on  par  with  ambient).  The  measured  RHdata  were  generally  in  the  range  of  40  to  50%  RH  during  the  overnight  periods  from  Nov  15 21.  In  addition,  since  the  nighttime  RH  was  about  3040%  higher,  the  simulated  daily  lows  during  this  period  were  also  elevated  by  about  20%.  The  simulated  RHdata  calculated  using  an  ACR  =  100  ACH  provided  a  better  approximation  of  the  nighttime  measured  data  but  these  data  poorly  estimated  the  RH  low  during  the  daytime. These data support the need for a variable or twostage ACR in the exterior cavity.   The  rate  of  air  exchange  between  the  exterior  cavity  and  the  outside  air  can  be  coarsely  divided  into  daytime  and  nighttime  categories.  The  data  analysed  in  this  section  indicated  that  the  ACR  and  ambient

  temperature  were  well  correlated  and  further  analysis  could  determine  the  relationship  between  exterior cavity ACRs and solar driven convection or wind speed and wind direction. At the very least, the  ability  to  set  a  nighttime  and  a  daytime  ACR  could  improve  the  model  results  for  southfacing  exterior  air cavities.  
5.3.6.1

Air change rate and cladding temperature

The  exterior  cavity  ACR  was  determined  to  have  very  little  effect  on  the  cladding  temperature.  The  cladding  temperature  data  extracted  from  the  comparative  ACR  models  were  analysed  and  are  presented  in  Figure  516.  These  data  show  that  negligible  temperature  effects  were  associated  with  the  varying  ACRs.  The  exterior  cavity  ACRs  of  0,  25,  100  and  210  ACH  (0,  0.46,  1.85,  3.89  m3/hr)  were  assessed  using  a  standard  deviation  test  across  each  measured  data  point  and  corresponding  model  timestep.   The  data  shown  in  Figure  516  illustrate  that  the  primary  source  of  temperature  deviation  occurred  during  the  peak  solar  radiation  hours  on  the  southfacing  walls.  These  temperature  profiles  show  that  there  was  generally  less  than  a  2°C  difference  in  the  simulated  cladding  temperatures  during  the  peak  solar (direct) radiation hours. The standard deviations between the daytime cladding temperatures were  0.07°C  in  the  south  data  and  0.02°C  in  the  north  data  for  simulations  that  used  a  2layer  exterior  air  cavity.  The  standard  deviation  between  the  different  ACRs  of  the  south  facing  walls  with  a  single  layer  air space was 0.29°C.

5.4 Solar data processing
The  measured  solar  radiation  data  were  collected  using  a  horizontally  positioned  pyranometer  located  at  the  BEG  Hut  test  facility  (Figure  31).  These  data  required  processing  to  separate  the  total  radiation  into  its  diffuse  and  direct  components  for  integration  with  the  exterior  climate  file  used  in  the  hygrothermal  modeling.  Quantification  of  the  direct  solar  radiation  component  was  necessary  for  the  accurate  simulation  of  the  heating  that  occurred  during  each  of  the  simulation's  timesteps.  These  detailed  solar  data  also  enabled  WUFI®  to  simulate  a  variety  of  orientations  and  inclinations  for  each  assembly under investigation.   The  separation  of  the  diffuse  and  direct  radiation  components  was  accomplished  using  a  methodology  presented  in  the  reference  "Solar  Engineering  of  Thermal  Processes"  (Duffie  and  Beckman,  2006).  In  addition  to  this  resource,  a  thorough  description  of  the  methodology  was  also  located  that  included  howto  instructions  on  the  creation  of  an  Excel  spreadsheet  to  perform  this  calculation  (Finch,  2007).  Both resources proved instrumental in accomplishing this task.  Once  the  solar  data  was  processed,  a  summation  analysis  was  performed  to  ensure  that  the  calculated  solar components were similar in magnitude to the measured data. This error analysis was completed by  calculating  the  difference  between  the  total  measured  radiation  and  the  sum  of  its  calculated  components  (diffuse  and  direct).  Summation  errors  occurred  in  22%  of  the  solar  file's  time  steps  and  occurred  with  an  average  error  of  4.9%  or  4.50  W/m2.  Errors  greater  than  the  average  occurred  in  8.2%  of  the  total  time  steps  and  the  maximum  error  observed  was  15.8  W/m2  or  11%  of  the  total  measured  radiation.  The  errors  were  most  often  associated  with  cloudy  or  hazy  days  when  the  magnitude  of  the  direct  component  was  very  low  (or  close  to  zero)  and  the  diffuse  component  calculated  slightly  higher  than  the  total  measured  solar  radiation.  Since  the  excess  solar  radiation  was  diffuse  radiation,  the  influence  of  these  errors  on  cladding  temperature  was  minimal.  The  nature  of  these  errors  indicated  that  the  diffuse  and  direct  radiation  components  were  suitable  for  use  in  the  hygrothermal  modeling.  A  sample  of  the  calculated  and  measured  solar  data  is  presented  in  Figure517  to  illustrate  the  results  of  the solar data conversion process. These data were measured between May 5th and 13th in 2013.   The solar data from May 5th to 7th represent relatively clear days while the remaining five days show the  effect  of  cloud  cover  on  the  diffuse  and  direct  components.  The  data  collected  using  the  horizontal  pyranometer  recorded  nonquantifiable  counterradiation  during  the  night.  These  negative  data  were 

117   

 

Figure517Comparisonoftotalsolarradiation(I)withthecalculateddirectanddiffusecomponents

filtered  out  of  the  measured  horizontal  data  file  prior  to  processing.  The  effects  of  nighttime  cooling  were represented in the model using the explicit radiation balance and the cloud index coefficient.   The  final  solar  radiation  data  file  was  also  used  to  create  a  logical  operator  (1  or  0)  for  each  timestep.  These operators were used in the calibration of the surface transfer coefficient by classifying the relative  humidity and temperature data as day or night based on solar radiation. 

5.5 OSB material properties
Once the basic WUFI® model was calibrated with the BEG Hut test data, the next task was to ensure that  relevant  material  properties  for  the  OSB  were  obtained.  The  WUFI®  database  was  updated  several  OSB  definitions  using  the  OSB  material  properties  located  in  the  NRCC46090  report  (Kumaran  et  al,  2003).  These  material  definitions  were  determined  through  investigations  of  six  different  OSB  products.  The  OSB density was found to range from 575 to 725 kg/m3. The average value of this range (650 kg/m3) was  used as the bulk density for each new database entry and the thickness was defined as 11.1 mm.   The  NRCC  report  tabled  the  average  sorption  and  desorption  ECM  data  along  with  the  standard  deviations  associated  with  each  data  point.  The  sorption  data  for  50%,  69.3%,  and  91.5%  RH  were  combined  with  the  88.9%,  and  93%  desorption  data.  The  standard  deviation  data  were  used  to  define  low,  average,  and  high  moisture  storage  functions  (MSF)  for  three  OSB  material  property  definitions.  These  moisture  storage  functions  are  shown  in  Figure  518.  The  additional  curves  for  OSB  1,  and  OSB  2  denote  the  sorption  curves  that  were  calibrated  to  the  measured  OSB  MC  data  in  some  of  the  High  RSI  118

test  walls.  All  of  the  sorption  curves  used  in  the  HighRSI  hygrothermal  simulations  are  presented  in  Appendix M.  The  upper  and  lower  ranges  of  the  WVDR  factor  were  also  used  to  define  two  OSB  materials  in  the  WUFI®  database.  The  averageMSF  was  used  in  both  of  the  high  and  lowWVDR  OSB  definitions.  Comparative  models  were  created  for  each  of  these  new  definitions  and  their  simulation  results  for  the  baseline  period  from  October  to  January  are  shown  in  Figure  519.  The  light  grey  line  defines  the  measured OSB MC data from the midheight MCsensor in datum wall S3. These data are compared with  the inner 3 mm OSB MC data (studcavity side) from the WUFI® simulations.   The  WUFI®  simulation  data  calculated  using  the  highMSF  and  lowMSF  OSB  definitions  showed  a  wide  variation in simulated moisture content. The OSB MCdata calculated using the highMSF OSB were 2.4%  MC  higher  on  average  than  the  OSB  MCdata  calculated  using  the  lowMSF.  This  separation  in  OSB  MC  continued  throughout  the  study  period  with  minimum  and  maximum  differences  of  1.3  and  3.2%  MC. 

Figure 519 OSB MC values calculated using the upper and lower ranges of MSF and WVDR in comparison with measuredS3data

119   

  The  OSB  MCdata  that  were  calculated  using  the  high  and  lowWVDR  factors  showed  that  variations  in  this parameter had a negligible effect on the OSB MC throughout the study period from October 2012 to  June  2013.  These  data  are  shown  in  Figure  519  (red  lines)  and  both  sets  of  model  data  are  essentially  superimposed  on  the  model  data  calculated  using  the  averageMSF  value.  The  difference  in  OSB  MC  between  the  high  and  lowWVDR  datasets  was  0.02%  on  average  with  a  maximum  difference  of  only  0.3% MC.   Additionally,  the  liquid  transport  functions  for  the  OSB  were  generated  by  WUFI®  from  the  following  data:     Reference Water Content 80 kg/m3  Free Water Saturation 377 kg/m3 (58% MC @ 100% RH)  Water Absorption Coefficient 0.0011 kg/m2s½ 

The  values  listed  the  NRCC46090  report  for  the  water  absorption  coefficient  ranged  from  0.0011  to  0.0033 kg/m2s½. The low end of this range was used in the OSB material property definitions.  

5.5.1 OSB moisture storage calibration
The  measured  and  simulated  MCdata  shown  in  Figure  519  illustrates  how  the  measured  data  varies  within the range of expected OSB MC. Initially, the measured data appeared to be well approximated by  the  highMSF  OSB  simulation.  In  contrast,  during  the  latter  part  of  the  baseline  period,  the  measured  data were  better represented  by the lowMSF OSB.  This variation between  the measured and simulated  data  was  minimized  by  changing  the  moisture  storage  function  to  reflect  the  OSB  1  sorption  curve  shown in Figure 518.

This  modification  of  the  sorption  curve  was  based  on  seasonal  changes  in  the  measured  relative  humidity of the wall cavities. The  measured S3  MCdata were compared with  simulation data calculated  using  the  OSB  1  sorption  curve.  These  data  are  presented  in  context  with  the  LowMSF  and  High  MSF  (blue)  results  in  Figure  520.  As  these  data  show,  the  measured  MCdata  were  better  approximated  by  the OSB 1 sorption curve.   The simulated OSB MC data represented in the preceding two figures were derived from the inner 3 mm  layer  of  OSB.  A  detailed  comparison  of  measured  and  simulated  MCdata  is  presented  in  Figure  521.  These  data  show  that  the  response  of  the  interior  1.1  mm  OSB  layer  (see  Figure  51  for  model  configuration) closely approximated the rapid daily fluctuations in the OSB MC while the 3 mm appeared  to represent  a longer  period average of the measured  MCdata.  The 1.1 mm  OSB model data were  used  to calibrate the air change rates and initial moisture RH levels for the cellulose insulation.  

5.6 High RSI calibrations
This  section  contains  the  calibration  results  of  the  High  RSI  wall  assemblies.  Once  the  datum  models  were  calibrated,  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  and  the  exterior  cavity  ACRs  were  used  to  created  hygrothermal  models  for  the  remaining  High  RSI  wall  types.  The  datum  models  were  expanded  to  include  the  extra  insulation  components  of  the  High  RSI  wall  designs.  Since  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  were  assumed  consistent  between  each  test  panel,  only  the  additional  insulating  materials  required  calibration  for  each  of  the  remaining  wall  types.  In  the  case  of  wall  Types  5  and  6,  the  interior  6mil vapour barrier was removed from the model.

5.6.1 Deep cavity cellulose wall Types 1 and 2
The  deep  cavity  cellulose  walls  were  shown  in  Chapter  4  to  have  a  performance  issue  related  to  excess  moisture  in  the  OSB  sheathing.  The  investigation  documented  in  this  section  used  the  calibrated  WUFI®  models  to  illustrate  that  the  source  of  the  elevated  OSB  MC  readings  resulted  from  the  entrained  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose  at  the  time  of  installation.  The  effectiveness  of  the  moisture  pin  isolators was also examined.   The material properties for cellulose fibre were obtained from the NRCC50287 report (Mukhopadhyaya  et  al.,  2007).  The  sorption  and  desorption  data  were  merged  to  create  a  single  sorption  curve  and  adjusted  to  reflect  the  difference  between  the  installed  density  ~68  kg/m3  and  the  NRCC  reported  density of 26 kg/m3. The sorption  isotherm  determined  the 

moisture storage function for the  cellulose  and  its  hygrothermal  performance  by  defining  the  amount  of  moisture  retained  by  the  cellulose  as  the  relative  humidity  of  the  air  fluctuated.  These  data  were  used  to  define  the

is  shown  in  Figure  522.  These  data  were  assumed  representative  of  the  cellulose  insulation  installed  in  wall Types 1 and 2 since detailed analyses were not performed on samples of the installed cellulose.

Baseline simulation results

The  two  types  of  deep  cavity  walls  that  contained  cellulose  insulation  were  the  Double  stud  and  the  I Joist  stud  wall.  The  insulation  cavities  of  these  walls  were  286  mm  and  241  mm  respectively.  Both  wall  types  experienced  serious  moisture  problems  arising  from  interstitial  condensation  during  the  test  period.  Moisture  content  analysis  indicated  that  the  vertical  profile  of  the  OSB  MC  was  not  uniform  in  three  of  the  four  test  panels.  The  southfacing  IJoist  wall  (S2)  was  the  only  deep  cavity  cellulose  wall  that  had  little  to  no  variation  in  the  vertical  OSB  MC  profile.  The  lower,  middle  and  upper  OSB  MCdata  122

collected from S2 were as uniform as the data  collected  from  the  datum  walls  and  the  exterior  insulated  walls.  Since  at  least  one  of  the  Type  1  and  2  walls  was  not  subject  to  serious  condensation  problems,  this

suggested  that  the  probable  cause  of  the  OSB  MC variability was the initial distribution of moisture within the cellulose.   A series of WUFI® simulations were performed to determine the effect that the initial cellulose moisture  content  had  on  the  OSB  performance.  Results  of  these  simulations  were  compared  with  the  measure  OSB  MCdata  to  determine  the  probable  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose.  The  initial  RH  values  for  the  cellulose  are  summarized  in  Table  52.  The  OSB  moisture  content  results  are  presented  in  Figure  524  to  Figure  527  using  the  simulated  11.1  mm,  3  mm,  and  1.1  mm  OSB  MCdata  in  comparison  with  the measured OSB MCdata. The 11.1  mm simulated OSB data were omitted from Figure 524 for clarity  since the 3 mm and 1.1 mm data effectively overlay the measured data.   There  were  two  distinct  OSB  moisture  storage  functions  used  in  the  WUFI®  simulations  for  wall  Types  1  and  2,  which  were  designated  OSB  2  and  OSB  3.  The  OSB  2  sorption  isotherm  was  used  in  the  S1,  N1,  and  S2  simulations,  while  the  OSB  3  sorption  isotherm  was  used  in  the  N2  simulations.  These  OSB  sorption  isotherms  were  selected  as  they  improved  each  model's  approximation  of  the  measured  OSB  MCdata  for  the  lower,  middle  and  upper  MCsensors.  The  OSB  2  and  OSB  3  sorption  isotherms  are  shown  in  Figure  523  relative  to  the  upper  and  lower  sorption  boundaries  defined  by  the  NRCC46090  data (Kumaran et al, 2003).

  The  WUFI®  simulations  used  the  established  surface  transfer  coefficients  and  the  twolayer  exterior  cavity  with  an  ACR  of  210  ACH  on  the  exterior  air  layer  (equivalent  to  105  ACH  using  a  single  air  layer).  The  initial  cellulose  moisture  content  was  then  varied  to  determine  the  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose insulation by visually comparing the simulated and measured OSB MCdatasets.   The  S2  IJoist  WUFI®  model  simulations  indicated  that  the  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose  insulation  was  2.85  kg/m3  (4.2%  MC),  which  corresponded  to  the  EMC  at  38%  RH  (23°C).  The  moisture  content  distribution  within  the  stud  cavity  was  determined  to  be  uniform  since  the  measured  datasets  of  the  lower,  middle,  and  upper  OSB  MCsensors  could  be  modeled  using  the  same  initial  moisture  conditions.  The  WUFI®  simulation  data  for  wall  S2  is  presented  in  Figure  524.  The  circled  area  in  this  figure denotes the change in OSB MC that resulted from the installation of the MCsensor isolators.  

Figure 524 Comparison of measured and simulated S2 OSB MCdata for the baseline period from Oct to Feb (InitialRH38%acrossthecellulose)

The  remaining  celluloseinsulated  walls  required  a  range  of  initial  moisture  contents  to  simulate  their  measured OSB MCdatasets because of the wide range in OSB MC within these walls.   The  northfacing  IJoist  wall,  N2,  had  the  widest  distribution  of  OSB  MC  in  the  vertical  profile.  Figure  525  shows  the  lower,  middle  and  upper  OSB  MCdata  curves  of  the  N2  wall  during  the  baseline  period  in  comparison  with  the  WUFI®  model  data.  The  simulated  OSB  MCdata  approximated  the  measured  data well for the lower and middle MCsensor locations. However, the upper MCsensor data were more  difficult  to  approximate  because  of  the  higher  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose.  The  initial  concentrations  used  at  the  L,  M,  and  U  sensor  locations  for  the  N2  WUFI®  simulations  were  53%,  72%,  and 78% respectively.

The  circled  data  in  Figure  524  and  Figure  525  show  the  effect  of  the  moisture  sensor  isolators  that  were  installed  to  eliminate  the  bypass  current  that  passed  through  the  cellulose  insulation.  These  insulators  were  most  effective  with  in  walls  where  the  initial  RH  across  the  stud  cavity  was  below  ~55%  RH and the OSB MC was below 10%.   The  relationship  between  the  electrical  sensor  responses  and  the  moisture  contents  of  the  OSB  and  cellulose  should  be  analysed  in  detail  to  determine  the  effects  of  electrical  polarization  within  the  cellulose insulation and its overall effect on the electric field and measured resistance values   125   

 

Figure526VerticalOSBMCprofileoftheN1 testwallcomparingWUFI® modelresultswiththemeasureddatain theL,M,andUhorizontalmodelplanes(InitialRH­55%,60%,55%)

The  OSB  L  MCdata  shown  in  Figure  525  also  indicated  that  the  electrical  isolators  applied  to  the  MC sensors  were  most  effective  at  lower  moisture  contents  since  the  simulated  data  closely  approximated  the  measured  data  prior  to  the  isolator  installation  in  the  middle  and  upper  OSB  MCdatasets.  The  middle  and  upper  MCdata  indicated  that  when  the  OSB  MC  was  above  1012%  MC,  the  electrical  resistance of the cellulose insulation was similar to the resistance of the OSB. The middle and upper data  from  this  figure  also  show  that  the  cellulose  was  rearranged  during  the  installation  of  the  isolators.  This  cellulose  rearrangement  suppressed  the  measured  OSB  MC  until  the  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose  reequilibrated  within  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  MCsensors.  This  effect  was  not  seen  in  the  126   

  comparisons of the lower MCsensor data because the cellulose MC was uniform across the depth of the  wall cavity.   The simulated MCdata for the 11.1 mm, interior 3 mm, and the  innermost 1.1 mm thicknesses how the  electrical  moisture  sensor's  depth  of  investigation  changed  based  on  the  moisture  flux.  Under  the  more  stable  natural  exposure  conditions,  the  11.1  mm  WUFI®  OSB  MCdata  was  more  representative  of  the  measured  data;  however,  during  shortduration  changes  in  the  vapour  drive,  the  1.1  mm  OSB  thickness  represented  the  MCresponse  more  accurately.  For  this  reason,  the  moisture  content  of  the  innermost  1.1 mm layer of the simulated OSB data was used as to compare with the measured datasets during the  air leakage analysis.   The  northfacing  Type  1  wall  performed  marginally  better  than  its  southfacing  counterpart  did;  however,  both  of  these  walls  significantly  underperformed  the  moisture  performance  of  S2.  The  initial  relative humidity values applied to the cellulose insulation were 55%, 60% and 55% through the N1 L, M,  and  U  modelling  planes,  respectively.  These  data  are  presented  with  the  N1  measured  data  in  Figure  526  and  they  indicate  that  the  isolators  worked  well  when  the  initial  relative  humidity  across  the  cellulose  insulation  was  about  55%  RH.  The  simulated  data  also  indicated  MCsensor  isolators  had  the  largest  effect  on  the  measured  data  at  the  lower  OSB  MCsensor  location  while  the  isolators  only  had  a  slight effect on the measured middle and upper OSB MCsensor data.  The increased effect of the isolators on the OSB L MCdata shown in in Figure 526 may be a result of the  cellulose density where better compaction at the lower MCpins that improved the contact between the  insulation and the MCsensors.   The comparisons of the S1 OSB MCdata are presented in Figure 527. The measured S1 L MCdata were  well correlated with the WUFI® data throughout the entire baseline analysis period while the measured  data from the middle and upper MCsensors were not as well approximated by the simulated data. The  higher OSB MCdata (relative to the hygrothermal model) recorded at the middle and upper MCsensor  locations were probably caused by threedimensional effects ­like convective air movement ­  that  could not be properly represented in a onedimensional model.   The initial relative humidity values used for the cellulose insulation were 55%, 54% and 60% through the  N1 L, M, and U modelling, respectively. The comparison of these measured and simulated MCdata also  illustrated the diminishing effectiveness of the moisture sensor isolators at higher moisture contents or  elevated RHlevels.   127

Initial cellulose moisture content simulations for N2 I Joist wall

The  differences  between  the  OSB  MC  of  the  north  and  south  facing  IJoist  walls  were  investigated  using  the  calibrated  hygrothermal  models.  Since  the  south  facing  IJoist  wall,  S2  performed  much  better  than  its  northfacing  counterpart  did;  multiple  simulations  were  performed  using  the  calibrated  N2  wall  model. These simulations used several different initial cellulose moisture contents to determine how the  north  facing  IJoist  wall  would  have  performed  by  varying  the  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose  insulation.  The  initial  cellulose  moisture  content  was  defined  in  the  model  by  the  setting  the  initial  RH  across  the  cellulose  insulation.  These  initial  RHvalues  were  30%,  40%,  50%,  72%,  and  80%.  The  MC 128   

  values  of  the  cellulose  that  correspond  to  the  initial  RHvalues used in the simulations are summarized in  Table 53. This table also contains the calculated OSB  MCvalues at the end of the baseline period for each  simulation  (Feb  19,  2013).  The  cellulose  moisture  content  values  were  determined  from  the  moisture  storage  function  created  from  the  NRCC50287  report data (Mukhopadhyaya et al., 2007).

The  initial  RHvalue  of  72%  corresponded  to  the  bestfit  simulation  value  for  the  middle  OSB  MCsensor  data  of  wall  N2  as  shown  in  Figure  525  (middle).  As  a  performance  reference,  the  initial  RH  across  the  cellulose  insulation  in  the  bestfit  model  for  the  south  facing  Ijoist  wall,  S2,  was  determined  to  be  38%,  which corresponded to a cellulose moisture content of approximately 4.2% by weight.   The  results  of  the  N2  simulations  are  presented  in  Figure  528  using  the  OSB  MCdata  for  the  innermost  (stud  cavity  side)  3  mm  layer  of  OSB.  These  data  indicate  that  the  OSB  MC  was  affected  by  the  initial  moisture content of the cellulose insulation and that the simulation data calculated using initial cellulose  RHvalues  of  30%  less  yielded  the  lowest  OSB  MCvalues.  These  data  also  indicated  that  the  OSB  MC  responded sooner to higher initial cellulose MCs.   The  measured  stud  cavity  RHdata  from  each  of  the  celluloseinsulated  walls  are  presented  in  Appendix  N.  These  data  show  that  the  S2  stud  cavity  RH  was  consistently  lower  than  the  RH  measured  in  the  N2  stud  cavity  during  the  baseline  period,  which  resulted  in  the  significant  difference  in  OSB  MC  between  these  N2  and  S2  walls.  The  RH  data  from  the  Type  1  walls  were  closely  correlated  between  the  north  and south walls.

5.6.2 Exterior insulated wall Types 5, 6, and 7
The three wall types that were insulated with rigid exterior insulation were also simulated using  hygrothermal models created with the WUFI® software. These models used the same established  surface transfer coefficients and exterior cavity ventilation rates as the previous simulations for the  cellulose insulated walls. The OSB sorption curves were also adjusted to match the seasonal  performance of the sheathing.  The measured OSB MCdata indicated that wall Types 5, 6, and 7 did not exhibit the same moisture

  related problems as indicated by the data collected from the deep cavity celluloseinsulated walls. Wall  Types 57 had more uniform vertical moisture content profiles within the OSB sheathing as well as  between upper and lower plates. For this reason, the measured and simulated MCdata comparisons for  these three wall types are presented in Figure 529  (South) and Figure 530 (North) using only the  middle OSB sensor datasets.   The  simulated  MCdata  closely  approximated  the  OSB  moisture  content  of  these  three  walls  during  the  baseline  period  with  the  1.1  mm  OSB  layer  data  yielding  the  closest  approximation  of  the  measured

  data.  The  model  data  for  the  Type  5  wall  (polyisocyanurate  insulation)  tended  to  overestimate  the  amount  of  interior  moisture  relative  to  the  other  two  wall  types.  The  simulated  cladding  and  OSB  temperatures  were  well  correlated  with  the  measured  data  so  the  cause  of  this  discrepancy  was  more  likely  related  to  the  vapour  permeability  of  the  polyisocyanurate  insulation  or  the  interior  drywall.  Air  leakage may also have been a factor since the Type 5 wall had a higher leakage rate than either the Type  6 or Type 7 walls (see Section 3.8.2 Air tightness test data). 

5.7 Air leakage simulations
The  method  used  to  simulate  the  air  leakage  (Künzel,  2012)  involved  the  placement  of  a  thin  1  mm  air  layer  within  the  stud  cavity  (Figure  51)  to  simulate  the  air  leakage.  The  air  within  this  1  mm  layer  was  exchanged with the interior climate air using an Air Change Source. The maximum air exchange rate was  determined  by  the  converting  the  air  injection  rate  to  an  air  leakage  rate  based  on  the  cavity  wall  area  as  shown  in  Table  54.  Since  the

airchange  layer  was  one  litre  (0.001  m3),  the  calculated  ACR  for  the  cavity  was  864  ACH  for  wall  Types  2,  3,  and  57.  The  ACR  for  wall  Type  1  was  432  ACH  because

of  the  interconnection  between  each  stud  cavity  within  the  test  panel.  Modeling  indicated  that  the  actual ACR required to approximate the OSB MC data was higher than the theoretical 432 ACH.   The  thin  airlayer  method  of  air  leakage  modelling  was  used  with  the  middle  and  upper  OSB  MCsensor  data,  since  it  did  not  simulate  the  enthalpy  of  the  air  leak.  Rather,  this  method  simulates  lowflow  air  leakage  with  long,  tortuous  paths,  and  convective  moisture  sources  (Künzel,  2012).  Analysis  of  the  vertical  temperature  profiles  indicated  that  the  middle  and  upper  OSB  temperatures  were  not  appreciably  affected  by  the  injected  air.  Therefore,  this  method  was  more  suitable  for  use  with  the  middle  and  upper  OSB  sensor  data  rather  than  the  lower  OSB  sensors.  In  order  to  model  the  lower  OSB  MCsensor  data,  an  additional  heat  source  with  a  transient  file  would  be  required  for  the  proper  simulation of the heat associated with the injected air.   Figure  531  shows  the  temperature  differences  between  the  lower  and  middle  S3  OSB  sensors  in  comparison  with  their  corresponding  WUFI®  output  from  February  17th  to  23rd,  2013.  The  air  injection  132

test  started  on  February  19th  at  16:30  hours  and,  as  the  figure  shows,  the  temperature  response  recorded  by  the  lower  OSB  T  sensor  was  immediate.  In  comparison,  the  S3  WUFI®  simulation  more  closely  approximated  the  measured  OSB  temperature  data  at  the  middle  sensor  location.  The  WUFI®  model  used  an  864  ACH  air  change  rate  in  the  1  mm  air  change  layer  (the  upper  OSB  temperature  data  were omitted from Figure 531 for clarity.) 

5.7.1 Air leakage modeling methodology
The  air  leakage  modeling  exercise  examined  the  variability  of  the  injected  air  flowpath  by  calibrating  the  ACR  of  the  1  mm  air  change  layer  with  the  measured  data  from  the  high  RSI  and  datum  walls.  The  idealized  flowpath  for  the  air  injection  experiment  is  shown  in  Figure  532  along  with  the  minimum  expected  vertical  airvelocities.  The  flowpath  and  air  velocity  within  the  stud  cavity,  however,  were  influenced  by  the  cavity  geometry  as  well  as  insulation  type  and  density.  The  flowpaths  within  the  southfacing walls may also have been enhanced by convective air currents arising from solar heating.  The  WUFI®  simulations  were  calibrated  by  varying  the  leakage  rate  via  the  ACR  of  the  1mm  air  change  layer  and  its  placement  along  the  horizontal  plane  of  the  OSB  MCsensors  shown  at  M  and  U  in  Figure  532.  The  airflow  rate  for  each  simulation  was  calibrated  with  the  corresponding  OSB  MCdata  to  establish an effective or equivalent flow rate based on the moisture load of the interior air and the RH of  the stud cavity.   The  location  of  the  1  mm  airlayer  along  the  horizontal  model  plane  influenced  the  OSB  MC  primarily  through  the  through  arrival  time  of  the  OSB  moisture  response  and  to  a  lesser  degree  the  magnitude  of  the  MC  response.  Placement  of  the  1  mm  airlayer  at  the  inner  surface  of  the  OSB  generally  had  the  closest approximation of the OSB MC curve for the fibreglassinsulated stud cavities of the datum walls.

  For  the  celluloseinsulated  walls,  the  arrival  time  of  the  moisture  flux  was  greatly  affected  by  the  moisture storage of the  cellulose and the placement  of the 1 mm  air layer relative to the OSB. The walls  with exterior insulation were generally modeled with the 1 mm air layer in the centre of the stud cavity. 

5.7.2 Air leakage model calibration
The  air  leakage  modeling  used  a  segmented  stud  cavity  (quartered)  so  that  the  1mm  air  layer  could  be  repositioned  cavity.  within  the  533

analysis,  the  1  mm  air  layer  was  initially  placed  at  the  100%  position  and  moved  towards  the  OSB  with  changes  to  the  air  change  rate  depending  on  the  model  results.  This  process  determined  the  air  change  rate  and  position  of  the  1  mm  air  layer  that  best  approximated  the  moisture  content  response  of  the  OSB to the air leakage test.

A  sample  of  some  comparative  results  for  the  southfacing  walls  S1,  S2,  and  S3  are  presented  Figure  534.  These  data  show  the  close  correlation  between  the  measured  and  simulated  data  during  the  air  leakage  test.  The  two  datasets  diverge,  however,  at  the  end  of  the  test  (April  8th)  through  the  drying  135   

  period.  The  model  data  predicted  lower  OSB  MC  values  during  this  time  because  the  onedimensional  model  did  not  account  for  the  entire  volume  of  moisture  stored  within  the  wall  as  well  as  additional  moisture  loads  arising  from  convective  moisture  movement.  At  the  end  of  the  drying  period  (June  3),  both the measured and modeled datasets had converged to within 1%.   The  hygrothermal  models  of  the  remaining  High  RSI  test  walls  were  also  calibrated  in  this  manner.  The  purpose  of  this  calibration  to  the  measured  data  was  to  improve  the  predictive  capacity  of  the  models.  The  middle  OSB  MCsensor  data  were  used  to  determine  the  effective  flow  rate  and  position  of  the  1

  mm  air  layer.  The  results  of  this  model  exercise  are  summarized  in  Table  55  with  the  position  and  air  change  rate  for  the  1  mm  air  layer  that  most  closely  approximated  the  OSB  M  MCdata  during  the  air  injection  test.  These  tabled  data  show  that  the  northfacing  walls  generally  required  higher  air  change  rates  in  the  1  mm  layer  as  well  as  placement  closer  to  the  OSB.  This  difference  is  likely  a  result  of  solar  heating  in  the  south  facing  test  walls  that  reduces  the  impact  of  air  leakage  on  the  OSB  moisture  content.   The  lower  OSB  MCdata  could  not  be  modeled  as  precisely  because  of  the  temperature  and  air  current  effects  caused  by  the  air  injected  air  and  the  drainage  of  condensation  from  the  upper  sections  of  the  wall.  The  temperature  effects  of  the  air  leak  were  the  lowest  in  the  deepest  cavity  wall  ­  Type  1,  with  negligible  temperature  effects  in  the  northfacing  wall  and  only  nighttime  temperature  differences  in  the  southfacing  wall,  S1.  The  measured  and  simulated  MCdata  are  presented  in  Figure  535  to  illustrate  the  effects  of  condensation,  temperature  and  air  circulation  at  the  lower  horizontal  model  plane  `L'.  The  OSB  sheathing  of  S1  experienced  greater  drying  because  of  its  southern  exposure  and  subsequently  less  condensation,  which  the  WUFI®  model  was  able  to  simulated  relatively  well.  The  simulations  did  not  replicate  the  sheathing  moisture  content  in  the  northfacing  wall  since  the

condensation  accumulated  in  the  lower  portion  of  the  wall  without  the  drying  influence  of  the  sun  and  convective airflow.   The  measured  S1  OSB  L  MCdata  (shown  in  Figure  535)  were  modeled  with  the  1  mm  air  layer  located  at  the  OSB  (0%  cavity  position)  and  an  864  ACH  air  change  rate.  The  measured  data  for  N1  OSB  L  were  modeled  using  three  1  mm  air  layers  that  distributed  the  moisture  load  throughout  the  air  injection  period;  otherwise,  the  shape  of  the  OSB  MC  resembled  the  response  observed  in  the  S1  MCdata.  The  three  air  layers  were  placed  at  0%,  25%  and  50%  with  corresponding  air  change  rates  of  216,  216,  and  432  ACH.  By  distributing  the  total  air  change  rate  within  the  stud  cavity,  the  effect  of  the  cellulose  insulation's  moisture  storage  capacity  was  more  effectively  simulated.  The  effect  of  condensation,  however,  would  require  an  additional  moisture  source  and  a  transient  file  defining  the  amount  of  liquid  water present.   During  the  modeling  process,  it  was  also  observed  that  the  placement  of  the  1  mm  air  layer  at  (or  too  close  to)  the  OSB  sheathing  resulted  in  a  drying  effect  that  reduced  the  OSB  MC  by  drying  the  cellulose.  This  effect  occurred  because  the  moisture  load  of  the  interior  air  was  less  than  that  of  the  cellulose  insulation. This drying effect only occurred where the cellulose moisture content was initially elevated.  138   

 

5.8 Model discussion
The  surface  transfer  coefficients  were  the  primary  target  of  optimization  as  these  constants  controlled  how  the  model  interacted  with  the  boundary  conditions,  which  ultimately  determined  the  temperature  regime  of  the  hygrothermal  model.  The  temperature  regime  was  also  determined  by  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  wall  components  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  cavity  ventilation  of  the  drained screened  cladding  system.  The  ventilation  of  the  exterior  cavity  primarily  influenced  the  flow  of  water  vapour  through  the  assembly  in  conjunction  with  the  water  vapour  permeance  values  of  the  assembly  components  (Mvalues).  The  optimization  of  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  was  also  an  iterative  process  as  some  of  the  coefficients  were  interdependent.  Some  of  these  coefficients  were  defined  with  constants  although  they  varied  seasonally  like  albedo  and  to  a  certain  degree  cloud  index.  When  combined  with  certain  threedimensional  effects  like  the  moisture  storage  in  framing,  some  inter seasonal  analyses  can  become  difficult  to  perform  accurately.  These  issues  were  most  apparent  in  the  divergences  between  the  measured  data  and  the  simulated  data  during  the  drying  period  after  the  air  injection test.   The sequence in which model calibrations were performed minimized some  of the compounding effects  of  physical  property  errors  by  first  optimizing  the  factors  that  governed  the  temperature  regime  within  the  model.  As  some  of  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  represented  variables  but  were  defined  with  constant  values,  these  constants  inherently  led  to  seasonal  inaccuracies.  These  errors  were  minimized  by  calibrating  the  surface  transfer  coefficients  separately  through  isolation.  Accurate  climate  data  were  essential to establish representative boundary conditions for the model.   Once the temperature and humidity profiles of the interior and exterior wall cavities were established in  the  model,  the  hygroscopic  properties  of  the  sheathing  and  insulation  materials  were  then  investigated  and  optimized.  The  temperature  and  humidity  of  the  wall  cavities  adjacent  to  the  sheathing  governed  the  moisture  content  and  vapour  permeability  of  this  component  because  of  the  sheathing's  hygroscopic  properties.  The  interconnected  nature  of  the  surface  transfer  coefficients,  boundary  conditions,  and  material  properties  necessitated  this  sequencing  in  order  to  obtain  optimizedvalues  for  the coefficients and minimize compounding errors.

6 CONCLUSIONS
The  following  conclusions  are  based  on  observations  between  October  2012  and  June  2013  and  do  not  include  summertime  moisture  responses  or  the  water  injection  test.  These  results  are  applicable  to  southern  Ontario in an urban setting with simulated air leakage  during the 49day test from  February to  April 2013 and do not constitute the final results of the High RSI wall study. 

6.1 High RSI wall performance
 The  datum  walls,  wall  Type  4,  and  the  exterior  insulated  test  wall  Types  57  had  uniform  moisture  distribution  throughout  their  woodbased  components  during  the  baseline  period.  The  standard  deviation  of  the  MCdata  in  these  walls  was  less  than  0.5%  in  the  OSB  sheathing  and  less  than  1%  between  the  upper  and  lower  plates.  Moisture  distribution  within  the  deep  cavity  celluloseinsulated  walls was more complex and the data indicated  that the  moisture stratification occurred with an overall  tendency  of  higher  MCdata  in  the  upper  portions  of  the  cavity  and  framing.  This  effect  was  most  exaggerated in the north facing walls.   The  air  injection  test  illustrated  that  the  warmer  OSB  sheathing  of  the  exterior  insulated  walls  reduced  the  risk  of  moisture  related  problems  especially  near  the  location  of  the  air  leak.  The  sheathing  in  wall  Types  57  performed  very  well  during  the  air  injection  test  as  the  OSB  MCdata  were  consistently  below  16%. The upper section of the stud cavity and the upper framing members had very slight risks of mould  growth  in  the  walls  with  low  vapour  permeability  exterior  insulation  (Types  5  and  6).  The  upper  plate  in  wall  Type  5  was  the  highest  of  the  exterior  insulated  group  with  the  moisture  content  of  the  N5  upper  plate exceeding 20% for two weeks in March 2013.   The  exterior  insulated  walls  performed  better  than  the  deep  cavity  walls  during  the  wintertime  air  leakage  test  primarily  because  the  sheathing  and  framing  materials  were  kept  well  above  the  condensation  point.  Wall  Type  7  outperformed  the  other  two  exterior  insulated  wall  types  because  of  the  high  vapour  permeability  of  its  exterior  insulation,  which  allowed  the  sheathing  and  framing  to  dry  to  the  exterior.  The  MCs  within  the  Type  7  walls  did  not  exceed  12%  MC  at  any  time  during  the  analysis  period.   The deep cavity celluloseinsulated walls and the datum walls had the largest overall increase in OSB and  plate MC during the study period. The condensation in these walls began in early fall and continued into  late  spring.  The  very  high  MC  in  the  lower  plates  of  the  deep  cavity  walls  remained  long  after  the  other  140   

  wall  types  had  dried  below  the  lower  decay  and  mould  risk  thresholds.  The  condensation  arising  from  the  cold  sheathing  may  have  been  trapped  on  the  plates  by  the  OSB  and  WRB.  In  the  south  orientation,  solar  heating  assisted  drying  by  evaporating  the  condensed  water,  which  allowed  the  water  vapour  to  escape  through  the  sheathing  and  WRB.  The  north  facing  walls  did  not  benefit  from  direct  solar  radiation  so  the  drying  process  was  much  slower.  The  slower  drying  potential  of  the  north  facing  walls  also  indicated  that  the  thermally  isolated  exterior  plates  in  the  double  stud  walls  could  be  especially  problematic  when  coupled  with  cold,  uninsulated  sheathing  that  promoted  condensation  and  increased  the potential for rundown and the pooling of liquid water on the plate.   The south facing IJoist (S2) wall showed some promise for the deep cavity cellulose approach as its OSB  sheathing  moisture  performance  was  better  than  that  of  the  south  datum  wall.  Model  analysis  suggested  that  the  lower  OSB  MCvalues  within  S2  arose  from  a  low  initial  cellulose  MC  in  the  ~4%  MC  range.  However,  even  though  the  OSB  sheathing  in  S2  wall  performed  well,  the  framing  plates  still  experienced  elevated  MClevels  in  the  20%  range.  While  reducing  the  initial  moisture  content  of  the  cellulose  lowers  the  builtin  moisture  load  of  the  wall  and  can  reduce  moisture  related  problems  by  increasing  its  moisture  buffering  capacity,  the  fundamental  issue  with  this  wall  type  remains  the  presence of a cold, uninsulated sheathing that provided a condensation plane in cold weather.   Obtaining  reliable  moisture  content  data  from  walls  insulated  with  cellulose  was  challenging  since  the  electrical  properties  of  the  cellulose  insulation  also  changed  with  moisture  content.  The  electrical  field  produced during the moisture content measurements was affected by both the conduction of electricity  through  the  cellulose  as  well  as  the  polarization  of  the  cellulose  (specifically  the  adsorbed  water).  The  largest  source  of  uncertainty  associated  with  the  cellulose  insulation  was  determined  to  be  the  direct  conduction  of  electricity  through  the  exposed  wire  connections  on  the  moisture  sensor  pins.  This  uncertainty  was  minimized  by  the  installation  of  the  siliconfilled  caps  overtop  of  the  moisture  sensor  pins.  These  caps  or  similar  electrical  insulation  should  be  installed  over  the  MCsensors  prior  to  the  placement of the cellulose in future research.   In  future  studies  with  unconventional  framing  materials  like  IJoist  wall  studs,  moisture  content  sensors  should  be  installed  near  the  base  of  the  IJoist  web  to  monitor  the  impact  of  interstitial  condensation  and determine risks to the structural integrity of these types of framing members.

6.2 Hygrothermal modeling
The  OSB  sorption  data  were  used  to  improve  the  calibration  between  the  simulated  and  measured  MC data by adjusting the values within the OSB MSF. These changes were based on the prevalent RHvalues  within  the  stud  and  exterior  cavities  during  periods  when  significant  divergences  occurred  between  the  measured  and  simulated  datasets.  These  RHvalues  proved  to  be  effective  in  removing  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  OSB  MSF.  Upon  completion  of  the  High  RSI  wall  study,  sorption  isotherms  could  be  determined  for  the  OSB  at  the  MCsensor  locations  in  order  to  compare  the  measured  with  predicted  OSB MSFs.   The  upper  and  lower  bounds  of  the  OSB  sorption  curves  suggested  that  an  average  23%  MC  performance  range  could  be  expected  in  the  simulation  results  within  a  model  calibrated  for  temperature and humidity. The range of values in the OSB MSF had the greatest effect on the difference  between the measured and simulated MCvalues while the range of uncertainty in the OSB WVDR factor  had a negligible effect on the model performance.   Adjustments  to the  moisture storage function  (once isolated through the calibration of the  temperature  and  humidity  regimes)  resulted  in  significant  improvements  between  the  measure  and  simulated  results.  These  improvements  varied  by  wall  type  and  orientation;  however,  they  were  typically  in  the  2 4%  MC  range.  At  50%  RH  (and  below),  the  uncertainty  in  the  OSB  MSF  could  result  in  a  3.3%  MC  difference,  while  above  93%  RH  the  uncertainty  climbed  to  6%.  Between  50%  and  93%  RH,  the  uncertainties  in  the  OSB  MSF  were  in  the  range  of  12%  based  on  the  range  of  values  in  the  sorption/desorption data.   The four sections of the OSB layer provided useful insight into the MCprofile across the thickness of the  OSB  both  seasonally  and  during  active  moisture  loading.  The  measured  MCdata  were  most  closely  approximated  by  the  MCdata  simulated  using  the  innermost  1.1  mm  OSB  layer.  The  multilayered  OSB  could  also  be  used  to  investigate  the  effect  of  RH  differentials  across  the  sheathing  on  its  water  vapour  permeability.  Multiple  OSB  model  layers  may  also  assist  in  the  development  of  a  damage  function  for  OSB  sheathing  by  providing  an  estimation  of  the  degree  of  wetting  present  through  moisture  content  distribution.   The  twolayer  exterior  cavity  improved  the  correlation  between  the  measured  RH  and  simulated  RH  of  the  exterior  cavity  by  buffering  the  effects  of  excessive  ventilation  that  occurred  as  a  result  of  the  constant  air  change  rate.  While  the  twolayer  exterior  cavity  provided  some  insight  into  the  air  142   

  movement  within  the  cavity,  the  daily  fluctuations  in  the  exterior  air  layer  could  have  been  simulated  using  a  transient  file.  The  transient  file  may  also  be  easier  to  relate  the  magnitude  of  the  ACR  to  solar  radiation or wind, however these ACRs would be specific to a given weather file.   The  air  leakage  modeling  indicated  that  the  1  mm  air  change  layer  was  effective  for  simulating  the  OSB  MC  that  was  not  affected  by  temperature.  The  simulations  showed  that  a  separate  transient  file  would  be necessary to account for the heat associated with the air leak in order to simulate the lower OSB MC sensor data.    The location  of the 1 mm  air change layer within  the stud  cavity  was found to be most representative in  the  middle  or  at  50%  of  the  cavity  depth  for  the  south  facing  walls.  The  north  walls  were  best  represented  by  either  the  50%  or  25%  cavity  depth  position  as  measured  from  the  OSB.  Since  the  location  of  the  1  mm  layer  within  the  cavity  affected  the  1  mm  ACR  that  best  fit  the  data,  there  exists  uncertainty with respect to the absolute values of the simulated flow rates or 1 mm air layer position.   The  simulations  required  lower  ACRs  in  the  1  mm  air  change  layer  in  order  to  simulate  the  measured  MCdata of the south facing exterior insulated walls relative to their north facing counterparts. The ACRs  used  in  the  north  facing  simulations  were  the  same  for  each  High  RSI  wall  type.  Both  Type  1  walls  used  the  calculated  ACR  value  of  864  ACH  while  the  other  wall  types  varied  from  north  to  south  ­  this  may  have been a function of cavity depth.   The  location  of  the  1  mm  air  change  layer  within  the  stud  cavity  affected  the  OSB  MCresponse  time  most  significantly  in  the  Type  1  &  2  deep  cavity  walls  because  of  the  moisture  storage  within  the  insulation that buffered the introduced moisture and retarded the OSB MCresponse.

7 FUTURE WORK
A  model  study  should  extend  the  performance  evaluations  of  the  High  RSI  walls  to  include  geographical  locations  with  a  wide  range  of  climates  in  order  to  determine  the  limits  of  performance.  An  expanded  model  study  could  also  be  pursued  to  investigate  wall  modifications  like  different  materials  or  framing  configurations. The models created in this project could also be used to determine the effects / limits of  higher RSI levels on moisture performance.   The  investigation  of  deepcavity  celluloseinsulated  walls  would  benefit  from  more  detailed  material  property  data  that  examined  the  sorption  and  desorption  curves  at  typical  high,  low,  and  average  service  temperatures.  Enhanced  knowledge  regarding  the  electrical  properties  of  cellulose  and  its  susceptibility to polarization at varying relative humidities or moisture contents would also be beneficial  for  data  acquisition.  Future  work  should  also  include  a  greater  number  of  RH/T  sensors  within  deep  cavity  celluloseinsulated  walls  in  order  to  determine  how  entrained  moisture  migrates  on  a  seasonal  basis.   The  mould  and  decay  analysis  should  be  extended  to  include  a  timecomponent  that  reflects  the  length  of  time  required  to  initiate  mould  growth  on  OSB  and  sprucepinefir  lumber.  This  was  not  included  in  this study but it would be beneficial asset in the determination of wood framed wall durability.

CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION DETAILS

In  July  and  August  of  2012,  the  1.2mx2.4m  test  wall  panels  were  constructed  and  installed  at  the  University  Of  Waterloo  Building  Engineering  Group  (BEG  Hut)  test  facility.  The  top  and  bottom  of  the  test hut wall openings were divided into bays to accept the test panels. These bays were hygrothermally  isolated  with  38mm  extruded  polystyrene  (XPS)  insulation  and  finished  with  spruce  plywood  (12.5  mm)  that  provided  a  nailing  surface.  Vertical  separators  were  then  installed  to  isolate  each  assembly.  The  separators  consisted  of  241mm  I  Joists  with  12.5mm  XPS  insulation  adhered  to  either  side  of  the  web  and  flush  with  the  flange  edges.  The  wall  openings  of  the  test  facility  were  subsequently  flashed  with  Blueskin  membrane  to  ensure  against  the  ingress  of  rainwater.  The  rough  installation  is  illustrated  shown below in Figure 71 Installation of rough framed test panels prior to instrumentation  and sealing.  SW corner of BEG Hut shown.  The  wall  assemblies  were  placed  into  the  rough  openings  with  a  12.5  mm  (approximate)  space  around

  the  panel  edge  to  allow  access  for  external  sensors  and  supply  tubing.  These  spaces  were  sealed  with  spray foam and silicone to eliminate the possibility of air leakage around the edges of the test panels.   The  structural  framing  of  each  wall  type  was  completed  according  to  the  technical  drawings  located  in  Detailed Construction Drawings. The rough framing of each assembly consisted of two main central stud  members,  top  and  bottom  plates,  two  9.5  mm  plywood  edge  studs  as  well  as  the  OSB  sheathing.  The  OSB  sheathing  was  installed  in  two  pieces  (610  x  1220  mm,  1829  x  1220  mm)  to  ensure  that  one  sheathing  joint  was  identically  located  in  each  test  assembly.  The  joint  was  placed  610  mm  up  from  the  bottom of the wall.   Once  the roughed in wall  assemblies were fastened  into position, the monitoring sensors, wetting sheet  and  supply  tubing  were  installed.  The  final  placement  of  the  exterior  temperature  and  air  cavity  space  RH/T sensors was completed with the installation of the siding.   The  exterior  wetting  sheet  was  stapled  into  position  with  the  6  mm  poly  tubes  as  shown  in  Figure  72.  The  feeder  tubes  were  routed  inside  between  the  assembly  and  the  dividers.  The  wetting  sheet  wrapped  around  the  perforated  end  of  the  tubing  across  the  width  of  the  sheet  to  ensure  the  even  distribution  of  injected  water  and  stapled  to  the  OSB.  The  tubing  was  perforated  using  with  a  3mm  drill  bit  create  four  holes  (top,  bottom  and  sides)  at  50  mm  intervals  across  the  width  of  the  wetting  sheet.  The  wetting  sheet  was  placed  on  the  vertical  centre  line  of  the  panel  about  90mm  above  the  bottom

146   

  edge  of  the  OSB.  The  top  edge  of  the  wetting  sheet  (and  the  tubing)  was  placed  90mm  below  the  OSB  joint.  Once  the  wetting  sheets  and  tubing  were  installed,  the  Tyvek  air  barrier  /  water  resistive  barrier  (WRB)  was  placed  on  the  OSB  and  sealed  to  the  Blueskin  using  the  red  construction  tape  shown  in  Figure  73.  The  space  around  the  panel  was  sealed  from  the  inside  using  spray  foam  (window  and  door  foam  sealant).The  exterior  was  then  finished  with  insulation  (as  required)  and  spruce  strapping  to  provide  a  nailing surface for the siding and an air space for the rain screen.  

Figure73Airandwaterbarrierofthedrainagecavity

The  siding  was  installed  in  the  latter  half  of  August  2012.  The  siding  was  installed  continuously  over  the  entire  length  of  the  adjoining  test  panels.  The  siding  joint  locations  were  carefully  selected  to  ensure  that  each  test  panel  had  the  same  number  of  joints.  At  this  time,  the  installation  of  the  exterior  temperature  and  RH/T  sensors  was  completed.  Figure  74show  the  north  and  south  facing  walls  (respectively) of the BEG Hut prior to siding installation.   After  the  siding  was  installed,  a  continuous  flashing  was  placed  at  the  top  of  the  test  walls  to  shed  rainwater.  Once  the  exterior  of  the  building  was  completed,  the  instrumentation  was  finished  on  the  interior.  The  interior  fibreglass  insulation  was  installed  as  well  as  the  6mil  poly  where  required.  Each  sheet of gypsum wallboard was cut and fit with an air injection port then sealed.

THERMISTOR RESISTANCE CALCULATION

Measuring  the  resistance  of  a  thermistor  using  only  voltage  requires  that  the  thermistor  be  wired  in  series  with  a  1000  measurement  resistor  so  the  voltage  divider  can  be  used  to  determine  the  resistance  of  the  RTD.  The  resistance  of  the  thermistor  is  calculated  using  Ohm's  law,  the  series  resistance  formula,  and  Kirchoff's  voltage  law.  The  relationship  between  voltage,  current  and  resistance  is shown by Ohm's law (Floyd, 2010):    I=V/R,where;

I=Current(Amps),V=Voltage(Volts)andR=Resistance() The  thermistor  measurement  circuit  is  shown  in  Figure  75.  The  current  and  voltage  applied  to  the  circuit  are  shown  by  Isup,  and  Vsup,  while  the  resistance  of  the  thermistor  and  its  voltage  potential  are  shown by Rtherm and Vtherm. Finally, the resistance of the  sensor  resistor  and  its  voltage  potential  are  represented by RsensorandVsensor.   Since  the  measurement  circuit  is  a  series  circuit  with  only  one  path  for  the  current  to  flow;  the  current  remains  constant  at  all  points  in  the  circuit.  It  also  follows that the total circuit resistance,   Rtotal=Rtherm+Rsensor.  Further,  using  Kirchoff's  voltage  law,  which  indicates  that  the  sum  of  the  voltage  drops  through  a  series  circuit,  equals  the  total  voltage  applied  across  the  circuit (Floyd, 2010).  

Figure75Thermistormeasurementcircuit

The current, voltage and resistance relationships can now be restated as follows:  Isupply=Vsupply/Rtotal Itherm=Vtherm/Rtherm Isensor=Vsensor/Rsensor

Since, Isupply = Itherm = Isensor,  it  follows  that,  Vtherm / Rtherm = Vsensor / Rsensor.  The  relationship  can  be  rewritten  as  (Vtherm/Vsensor)Rsensor=Rtherm and  then  by  substituting  (Vsupply­Vsensor)forVtherm  ,  the  final equation to calculate the thermistor resistivity is:     Rtherm=Rsensor(VtotalVsensor)/Vsensor 

Using this equation the value for Rthermcan then be used in Equation 22 (Section 3.6.3) to determine the  temperature of the thermistor in degrees Celsius.

MOISTURE PIN ISOLATORS

Installation of Silicone Insulators in the IJoist and Double Stud Wall Assemblies   Moisture  content  (MC)  pins  were  installed  in  the  OSB  sheathing  (3  sets)  and  spruce  plates  (2  sets)  on  all  of  the  test  walls.  The  moisture  contents  measurements  indicated  that  the  sheathing  and  plates  of  the  2x6  framed  walls  were  closely  correlated  between  each  of  the  different  walls  ­  by  location  in  the  wall  and  wall  orientation.  The  calculated  MC  was  also  within  the  expected  range  indicated  by  both  the  hand  held  meter  as  well  as  the  calculated  equilibrium  moisture  content  (EMC).  For  example,  the  EMC  for  wood  at  20°C  and  50%  RH  is  9.3%.  With  slightly  lower  temperature  within  the  wall  cavities,  moisture  contents 12% higher can be expected.    The  moisture  contents  calculated  for  the  sheathing  and  plates  of  the  deep  cavity  walls,  however,  were  higher  than  expected.  The  two  deep  cavity  walls,  I  Joist  and  Double  Stud,  were  filled  with  densepack  cellulose  insulation.  The  cellulose  insulation  had  a  higher  electrical  conductivity  compared  to  the  fiberglass  insulation.  Since  the  cellulose  is  hygroscopic,  the  adsorption  of  water  molecules  in  the  pores  of the cellulose affects its electrical conductivity and dielectric strength. The insulation and the bare wire  connectors  on  the  MC  sensors  created  a  bypass  circuit  that  resulted  in  lower  measured  resistances  and  increased the calculated MC values.  The  remedy,  shown  in  Figure  76,  was  to  install  20  mm  long  pieces  of  silicone  filled  12.5  mm  diameter  polyethylene  tubing  over  the top of the sensor pins to insulate the bare  wire  connections  on  the  pins  from  the  cellulose  insulation.  The  polyethylene  tubing  allowed  the  silicone  to  be  placed  over  top  of  the  bare  connections  with  minimal  disruption 
Figure 76 Silicone insulator caps used to isolate moisture pinsfromcelluloseinsulation

to  the  insulation.  The  risk  of  contaminating  the  silicone  with  cellulose  was  reduced  as  well.  Subsequent  measurements  revealed 

that  the  silicone  caps  reduced  the  electrical  `leakage'  around  the  moisture  pins  and  resulted  in  more  representative moisture content measurements.     174   

 

Results
The  moisture  content  data  from  the  affected  walls  is  presented  below  along  with  the  MC  data  from  the  datum  wall  (Type  3)  for  comparison  in  Figure  77  to  Figure  711.  The  silicone  insulators  were  installed  around midday on October 22, 2012. 

TopPlates

Figure77TopPlateMC(%)SouthWalls (Left),NorthWalls(Right)

 South facing top plates  (Figure  77)  ­  S1MDET  has  the  highest  average  moisture  content    12.1%  compared  with  10%  moisture  content  of  the  remaining  south  facing  top  plates.  The  top  plate  moisture  content in S2 closely matches the datum, S3.   The calculated EMC for the S1 top plate is 11.2% when the plate temperature and cavity RH is used (60%  and  12°C).  Since  the  exterior  plate  of  the  double  stud  wall  does  not  bridge  to  the  interior,  it  can  be  expected  to  be  at  a  lower  average  temperature  during  this  time  of  year  and  is  more  likely  to  be  influenced by exterior conditions.   North facing top plates  (Figure  77)  ­  N2MDET  has  the  highest  average  moisture  content    13.2%  (reduced from 15.8%). The calculated EMC using the average cavity RH and plate temperature is 11.4 %.  The isolators had less of an impact on N1MDET similar to S2MDET.

  OSB­Upper,middleandlowerMCsensors The silicone insulators were most effective in reducing the current loss in the OSB moisture pins   Upper OSB  ­  The  measurements  for  the  upper  OSB  MC  in  the  south  facing  walls  (Figure  78    Left)  occur within a 1% range (6.1% to 7.1%) after the installation of the insulators. The average MC values for  S1MEIU  were  reduced  from  10.1%  to  7.1%.  The  MC  of  the  upper  OSB  in  the  north  facing  walls  (Figure  78   Right)  occurs  within  a  2%  range  (6.3%  to  8.3%).  The  highest  MC  values  were  recorded  at  the  N2 MEIU sensor ­ these measurements were reduced from 14.6% to 8.3%.

The replacement of Tsensor S1TEIL is also visible in Figure 710 (Left) on October 22.   Lower Plates   South facing lower plates  (Figure  711)  ­  The  moisture  content  of  the  south  facing  lower  plates  averages  10.1%  overall  and  plot  within  an  approximate  2%  MC  range  of  each  other  ­  there  is  no  significant difference in the calculated MC as a result of the cellulose isolators.   North facing lower plates  (Figure  711)  ­  The  highest  moisture  content  measurements  occur  in  N1  and  N2.  The  average  MC  of  N1MDEL  is  12.5%  (reduced  from  14.1%)  and  N2MDEL  is  11.1%  (reduced  from  13.2%).  The  moisture  content  of  the  remaining  north  facing  lower  plates  is  10.4%  on  average.  The  lower  plates  in  the  north  walls  are  still  slightly  elevated  with  respect  to  the  other  test  panels.  The  lower  plate MC in N1 returned to its previous MC (~14%) within a week.

The  OSB  MSFs  are  compared  in  the  graph  presented  in  Figure  731  to  illustrate  the  differences  between  each  of  the  MSFs.  The  predominant  OSB  MSF  type  used  in  the  hygrothermal  simulation  was  OSB  2.  The  most  common  deviation  from  the  OSB  2  MSF  occurred  in  the  50%  RH  range  with  OSB  3  and  OSB  4  varying  at  the  70%  RH  data  point.  For  higher  RHvalues,  the  OSB  2  and  OSB  3  MSF  definitions  used  the
