Introduction

Metal rolling is a common plastic working technique in which deformation takes place between two rolls with parallel axes revolving in opposite directions as shown in Fig. 1. In practice, the stock is passed through a series of rolls for successive reductions which requires more investment in equipment [1]. A more economical practice is to use a single two high stand; a process often called 'cogging' 121.

In this paper, the cogging process is considered as a multipass process. Multipass processes represent a class of dynamical systems that operate in repetitive cycles. Each cycle of operation is called a pass and the interaction between the outputs generated during successive cycles of operation is called pass interaction. Examples of such processes, besides the metal rolling, are metal cutting processes, binary distillation colimns, liquid/liquid heat exchangers, automatic ploughing, vehicle convoys, and the standard multipass process 'verticallysteered longwall cool-cutting machine' [3,4,5]. The approach taken in this paper is so general to be applicable to any of the above mentioned processes as well. The stability of multipass processes has been aamined by Edwards [2] where the multipass process is converted into an infinite-length single-pass process described by a functional differential equation and then the standard inverse-Nyquist stability criteria is applied. This approach has been examined by Owens [6,7] who showed that it neglects disturbances at the beginning of each pass. Therefore, it is natural to introduce pass delay and to discuss the stability of multipass processes using multidimensional system stability theory. In two more recent publications Boland and Owens [8] and Edwards and Owens [5] showed that for discretized multipass procese two-dimensional (2-D) bounded-input bounded-output (BEBO) stability is equivalent to what is known as the stability along the pass [2]. An analogous result for differential multipass processes has been presented in Foda and Agathoklis [9]. In [10] the coefficient assignment for 2-D discrete systems has been applied to design a tracking controller for the metal rolling process. Differential multipass processes have been recently studied using delay differential sytem modeLs [11]. Analytic tests for asymptotic stability and stability independent of delay (i.o.d.) for delay differential systems are available [12,13,14]. Also, sufficient conditions for the stability of delay differential systems using the Lyapunov approach have been developed by Agathoklis and Foda [15,9]. These stability results are used to determine the constraints on the gains of the finite dimensional controllers such as proportional plus derivative (PD) controllers in order that the controlled metal rolling process would be stable against delay variations.

The paper is organised as follows. The next section contains background material and results pertinent to delay differential and multipass systems. In Section 3, the metal rolling is modelled as a delay differential system with two noncommensurate delays, namely the pass delay and the gauge sensor measurement delay. In Section 4, the stability of the metal rolling process is considered. Proportional plus derivative (PD) controllers are desiged for the controlled metal rolling proces using the asymptotic stability i.o.d. criteria for delay differential systems. It is shown that this criteria, which is stronger than the asymptotic stability criteria for delay differential sytems, is more appropriate, taking into consideration the nature of the delays involved. Discussion and some concluding remarks follow in Section 6.

Delay Differential System

In this setion, delay differential system models and their stability are discussed. Our interest in this type of multidimensional systems is derived from the fact that the metal rolling proces discussed in the next setion is a differential multipass process [11,i,71 and such processes can be modeled via delay differential equation. An autonomous delay differential system with m noncommensurate delays is represented by a functional differntial equation of the form

Eq. (1) is called comensurat if m = 1. The characteristic polynomial associated with this delay differential system would be a multivariate of the form

whichcn be written in in the form of (3). This 2-D state space model realizes both neutral (c,,j, $ 0, for E ji, ni]) some j E [1, nil) and retarded (C.,sj = 0, V i differential delay systms. Also, a delay differential system with m noncommensurate delays may be modelled by the following generalized linear sstem model 117,181 (6) D(zi. ..z,) i:(t) = A(zi, ... . z.) z(t) + , .

The stabiity of delay differential sytems has been studied via the investigation of the zero sets of the charactristic polynomial 112,13,14j and using 1-D fequency dependent Lyapunov equations. Also, m-D constant parameter Lyapunov equations of a special form, that combines both known forms of the Lyapunov equation, have been recently derived 115,20] for the stability analysis of delay differential systems. First let h = max hs, i = 1,...,m and let B denote the Banach space of continuous functions from [-h,01 into R equipped with the sup norm [104) = sup1.*_1 It(c)V for any 0 E B (8) Also let ug E B denote the function segment defined by yt ( yf)=y(t + ar), a [ I - h, 0] Consider the autonomous delay differential stem given by Eq.

where p denotes the differentiation operator d/dt, y0(t) is the actual roll-gap thickness, yi(t) is the thickness of the incoming metal strip, yd(t) is the desired value of motor deflection from the unstressed position, M is the lumped mass of the roll-gap adjusting mechanism, A1 is the stiffness of the adjusting mechanism spring, A2 is the hardness of the metal strip, A = A1A2/(A1+A2) is the composite stiffness of the metal strip and the roll mechanism, wo = [(ka + A)/M]10, e = k./(2w0M) are the angular natural frequency and the damping ratio of the local servo, and k., k6 are the proportional and derivative gains of the servo controller. The work strip can be passed back and forth through a reversing stand (cf. Fig. 3) which requires extra power [1]. Therefore, it is assumed that the strip is passed repeatedly through a non-reversing single stand where the roll-gap is reduced for each pass, a process often called 'cogging' [2]. Nonetheless, this process is slow

2407

and ha a variable pass delay since the stock is usually passed over the top of rolls. The thickness of the icoming strip can be related to the actual roll-gap thickness by the foHowing interpas equation (19) wh(t) = y4(t - hi) where the delay ht1 denotes the pas delay and it may be related to L, the length of the metal strip which varies from pass to pass. Eq. (19) will be referred to as the pass interaction equation. The gauge thickness is usually controlled via a proportional feedback control of the form where k. is the loop gain and y,(t) is the adjustable reference setting for the desired strip thickness. The delay h2 is the output sensor masurement delay which is given by h2 = X/v(t) where, as shown in Fig. 3, X is the distance between the roll-gap and the output sensor and v(t) is the velocity of the metal strip which may also vary from pas to pas. Hence, the controlled metal rolling process is described by the delay differntial equations (19-20) and

as follows. Let z1,2 be the shift operators defined by zj y,(t) y,(t - hi), i- = 1,2. Also, define xz(t) A yo(t), xzz(t) A j.(t) and zx(t) A [x1(t) , x2(t)]. Then Eq. (24) can be modelled by

A(zi,z2) x(t) + B(zi,z,) yr(t) (26) where A, B, and D are over the ring R[zi,zsJ- and A(z, z2) = [ 01(Z.Z) v(] where

If the pass delay is an integer multiple of the outment delay or the measurement deput sensor can be neglected, the above models would be comlay mensurate. Another case that results in a commensurate model is the so-called previous pass control [5] for which h2 = hft. For example, if f2 is neglected the metal rolling process dynamics would be described by the state space model

where w2-(kt + A)/M and 2Ew = /M . This is a delay differential system of the neutral type with two noncommensurate delays hA and h2. The characteristic mult'ivarate associated with this system can be written in the form

Stability Analysis and Stabilization

In this section the stability of the metal rolling process

2408

is analysed as a delay differential system. The objective is to calculate bounds for the PD controller gains k0, kI, and ke to guarantee the stability of the controlled process described by the delay differential equation (24). h1 and h2 are not constant in general and therefore, asymptotic stabUity in delay intervals and asymptotic stability i.o.d. should be considered (cf. Definition 3). However, it is very difficult in general to check any of these stability conditions for the noncommensurate case and, therefore, one can consider pointwise asymptotic tability us-ig Eq. (16). Condition (16) can be further simplified due to the fact that the regularity of F(zl, z2) in Eq. (27) on the closed unit bidisc 02 iplies that the eigenvalues Ai of F(zl,z2) are regular functions of (Zi,Z2). Thus if Re A, > 0 for some (z,z) E 02 , it must be true that Re Ai > 0 V (zi,z2) in an open neighbourhood of (4t,4;). Therefore, instability of the multipass process in the pointwise asymptotic stability sense can be detected by checking the eigenvalues of F(z1, z2) on T2. This can be carried out using a suitably fine partition of T2 which is a finite computation. Furthermore, the testing of the eigenvalues of F(z1, Z2) can be done by applying existing stability tests for polynomials with complex coefficients [25] to the characteristic polynomial of F(z1,z2). The stability analysis can be further simplified by considering the case where the sensor delay is neglected. This leads to a commensurate model for which asymptotic stability can be checked using the analytic stability test provided by Theorem 2. Assuming zero reference input, the delay differential equation (24) becomes

Hence, the inequalities (31) and (32) give the design constraints on the PD controllers gains to guarantee the asymptotic stability i.o.d. for the controlled commensurate metal rolling process.

Discussion and Conclusions

The metal rolling process has been modelled using delay differential equations with commensurate and noncommensurate delays. These delays correspond to pass delay and measurement delays. It has been demonstrated that the theory of multidimensional systems, delay differential or multipass systems, is a natural setting for the study of the metal rolling process. It has been shown that the conditions of asymptotic stability i.o.d. can be employed to calculate bounds for the controlled process controller gains to guarantee stability against delay variations.
