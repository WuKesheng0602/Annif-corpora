Abstract
The impact of symbiosis on the heating and cooling requirement of an office building and urban  rooftop greenhouse  Master of Building Science, 2013  Andrea Vickers  Building Science, Ryerson University  Urban agriculture is an important step towards food security in cities where rooftop space is abundant,  and underused. This research addresses the potential impact of adding a rooftop greenhouse to a six  storey, detached office building on the total heating and cooling energy consumption of both structures  operated yearround, using IESVE simulation software.  Several variables including the level of insulation between the office building and greenhouse, additional  thermal mass, the greenhouse envelope and greenhouse internal loads were tested to observe trends  that suggest an impact on the system's conditioning energy due to the presence of the greenhouse.  Overall, it was found to be most likely that the greatest energy savings for an integrated office building  and rooftop greenhouse would be achieved with the highest resistance greenhouse envelope possible,  which may be limited by the light needs of plants grown in the greenhouse, and incorporation of  thermal mass in the greenhouse.

1. Introduction
Urban populations in Canada are consistently on the rise, and as cities expand, agricultural land on the  outskirts is displaced (Statistics Canada, 2012). With the loss of agricultural land, there may not always  be enough room to produce food for the growing global population. Urban agriculture is, therefore, an  important step towards food security in cities. While it may only provide a small portion of the food  supply required to support the urban population (MacRae et al., 2010), it is becoming a forum for  highlighting responsible agricultural practices, and creates awareness of the food system in urban  residents (Lufa Farms, 2013).   A large, and mostly untapped, resource for urban agriculture is the space available on rooftops.  Specifically commercial rooftop greenhouses, like Lufa Farms in Montreal and Gotham Greens in New  York City, serve to intensify the use of city land and diversify urban employment opportunities. Rooftop  greenhouses in the city provide opportunities for food education, and, depending on agricultural  intensity, appealing leisure space for users of the host building. Their proximity to consumers also insists  on a level of accountability on the part of the growers and delivers unparalleled freshness.  This document presents the results of a research study concerning rooftop greenhouses. The  investigation highlights further value in installing a rooftop greenhouse, over a six storey detached office  building, by examining the thermal symbiosis of the two structures.   To this point, little research has been conducted on the subject of urban rooftop greenhouses, and no  computer simulation models could be found attempting to show thermal symbiosis between the two  structures. However, the Seawater greenhouse in London, England has been studied extensively using a  calculation method developed in the European Passive Solar Handbook to show that the heating load of  the host building is reduced in the winter due to the presence of a rooftop solarium.   A review of academic literature is conducted concerning existing rooftop greenhouses, and other  subjects that relate closely to the phenomenon under study including green roofs, double skin facades  and attached sunspaces and, more broadly, the opportunity for rooftop urban agriculture in the Toronto  context. From this literature review, objectives for the research and four detailed research questions are  developed. A detailed methodology is proposed in order to systematically examine a simulated rooftop  greenhouse and host office building. Finally, the results of the thermal simulation are outlined, and  analyzed in order to draw final conclusions about the research.

2. Literaturereview
Very little academic literature exists on the synergistic thermal relationship of a rooftop greenhouse  with its host building. Research has been done focusing specifically on the direct, intentional transfer of  heat, but fewer on the indirect thermal benefits such as those that were investigated in this research  (Pervila, Remes, & Kangasharju, 2012; Scott, 2011). Prominent commercial rooftop greenhouse  establishments have only begun operations in the last few years, including Lufa Farms in Montreal and  Gotham Greens in New York City (Gotham Greens, 2013; Lufa Farms, 2013) therefore research and  publication of initial academic literature may still be forthcoming.  

2.1 Opportunityforurbanagriculture
According to Rodriguez (2009), in a dissertation estimating the productive potential of London,  England's rooftops, a "very conservative" yield estimate for greenhouse hydroponic production is 300  tons/ha/yr, meaning that the greenhouse modelled herein (986m2) could theoretically yield 29 tons of  produce annually. As another example, Lufa Farms is a 2880m2 (31000ft2) commercial production  operation, and produces up to 100 tons of produce annually, feeding 2500 people in Montreal (L.  Rathmell, personal communication, July 22, 2013). This lends further credibility to the number  postulated by Rodriguez, and suggests that the greenhouse under study could provide hydroponic  vegetables to more than 800 people at peak production.   Research on urban agriculture in Singapore finds that 35.5% of the country's fresh vegetable  requirement could be provided with building integrated gardens on public housing apartments ­ as  compared to just 5% production within the borders of the country at present (Astee & Kishnani, 2010).  This would reduce the country's food related carbon footprint enormously, and provide opportunities  for both landscape design and community involvement in food production. The study stresses the  importance of food security, as the global urban population grows and modern farming practices cause  damage to what land is left for food production.   More locally, a study done at York University examined the feasibility of providing 10% of Toronto's  fresh vegetable requirement by aggregating the resources of existing city census farms, empty city plots,  and rooftop spaces (MacRae et al., 2010). In total, the city would require 2317 hectares to meet 10% of  Toronto's fresh vegetable needs, although researchers foresee difficulty producing some specific crops  in the quantity required to meet current demand. In total, 25% of the rooftop area identified in a  previous study of potential green roof spaces was allocated for food production, totaling approximately  10% of the city's rooftop area.   2   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    Additionally, incorporating food production into a city on rooftops also saves the energy of long distance  transportation, or `food miles', which are estimated at 4500km in the Toronto area for average,  imported food (MacRae et al., 2010). 

2.2 Roofasaresource
A similar area of research involves the building energy reduction potential of green roofs. Niachou et al.  (2001) show that a building with a green roof (regardless of the level of roof insulation) benefits from  smaller variation in interior temperature due to heat flux through the roof, thereby smoothing over  cooling peaks in the summer. In buildings with low levels of insulation, green roofs were estimated to  provide an energy savings of 37%, while buildings with moderate to high levels of insulation benefited  less (4%, and less than 2%, respectively), because of the already reduced heat loss through the  envelope. The major benefit of a green roof to the building is therefore the reduced peak heating and  cooling loads; the heat load reduction potential has to do with the insulation capacity of the  components of the green roof, while the reduction of cooling load is attributed to foliage shading, as  well as evapotranspiration by the plants, which provides the roof with an evaporative cooling effect  (Jaffal, Ouldboukhitine, & Belarbi, 2012). As compared with a green roof, the system proposed for this  research with a rooftop greenhouse does not benefit directly from a layer of extra insulation, but could  benefit from latent heat dissipation ­ through the latent load of plants to ventilation ­ reducing the  cooling load.  The greenhouse is also comparable to a reflective or `cool' roof, as the predominant roof material  exposed to solar radiation is glass. The heat gain through a traditional dark roof necessitates additional  cooling load, while a study by Jo et al. (2010) shows that a reduction by approximately 1.5% and 3% of  the building's total monthly electricity consumption is achievable in a building with 50% and 100% cool  roof coverage, respectively.   Parallels with the proposed research are also drawn to literature concerning the energy performance of  buildings incorporating doubleskin facades, which can be compared with the greenhouse on the roof. In  their study of double skin facades, Zhou & Chen (2010) identify the technology as being an effective  collector of solar radiation to reduce the heating and cooling energy required by the building. Especially  pertinent is a study conducted on double skin facades using plants as the shading device. Stec et al.  (2005) found that the temperature of all layers of the double facade, including the internal wall, was  reduced when plants were used as the shading device as compared with blinds (20% reduction) or no  shading. Plants not only block solar radiation from reaching the interior surface through shading, but  3   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    convert solar energy to both latent and sensible forms to dissipate the heat, as the plants in the  greenhouse will do.  

2.3 Buildingintegratedgreenhousesandsunspaces
Anecdotally, Lufa Farms' rooftop greenhouse in Montreal was shown to use only 6070% of the energy  of a traditional rural detached ground level greenhouse (L. Rathmell, personal communication, May 6,  2013). This provides a good indication that there is an energy benefit to an urban rooftop greenhouse,  although it does not clarify the mechanism that causes the greenhouse to perform so much better.  Research similar to the current investigation has been conducted at the University of Sheffield,  specifically with respect to a rooftop greenhouse in Hackney, London called the Seawater Greenhouse,  retrofitted onto a two storey office/workshop. The greenhouse is not fully glazed and therefore more  akin to a solarium. Scott (2011) investigated the rooftop greenhouse/solarium space using a manual  calculation method called New Method 5000, outlined in the European Passive Solar Handbook  (Goulding, Owen, & Steemers, 1992). Alongside a well insulated office building, using preheated  ventilation air from the greenhouse, the heating requirement was reduced by almost 50%. As a result,  the office building is only heated in December and January to maintain occupant thermal comfort  (assuming an office setpoint temperature of 21°C). It is not discussed what temperature is able to be  maintained in the greenhouse at night, as it focuses mainly on the level of savings possible in the office.  A brief study of greenhouse envelope materials showed double polycarbonate glazing reduced the  heating requirement of the building most significantly. It had about the same effect as a steel frame,  timber stud (nonglazed) storey, and performed better than either single glazing or polythene. The study  was done with limited observational data from the heating season only, and does not investigate the  effect of plants in the greenhouse. Also, the heat is actively vented from the greenhouse to the rest of  the building instead of the exclusively indirect transfer investigated herein.   In a Mediterranean climate, the evaporative pad cooling system of a computer simulated rooftop  greenhouse was able to entirely replace the HVAC system of its coolingdominated host office building,  in addition to taking care of the needs of the greenhouse (Caplow & Nelkin, 2007). It was found that the  greenhouse is able to replace the office HVAC system by ventilating air from the greenhouse into the  office building for lowgrade cooling. This use of the rooftop space for a greenhouse not only adds  productive capacity to the building overall, but eliminates the need for a fossil fuel or electric powered  cooling system in the office building, replaced instead by the evaporative cooling system involving only a 

4   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    small energy for fans. This system is contingent on a sustainable supply of water (rainwater or reverse  osmosis of ocean water is suggested).   Using the same system (greenhouse + two storey building) from the research by Caplow & Nelkin (2007)  except in the London climate, Delor (2011) also investigated controlled environment building integrated  agriculture, focusing specifically on hydroponic rooftop greenhouses. Delor also used the New Method  5000 (from the European Passive Solar Handbook) and found that a well insulated office building, with  the addition of a well insulated rooftop greenhouse, could benefit from a 13% decrease in annual  heating energy as compared with the identical separated building and greenhouse. In a poorly insulated  building, the addition of a rooftop greenhouse saved 41% energy annually. This assumes an active  transfer of waste heat from the greenhouse to the office building, and vice versa. Delor also indicates  that while green roofs perform better than rooftop greenhouses to prevent heat loss, rooftop  greenhouses can be used for both solar heat gains and evaporative cooling.   Attached sunspaces are closely related to rooftop greenhouses, and were investigated to ascertain  whether their trends correspond with the current research. One such investigation considered an  attached sunspace on a small, singlezone structure using TRNSYS modelling software, in 4 climates in  Europe (Milan, Dublin, Athens and Florence) and on two representative days of the year, January 12 and  July 4 (Mihalakakou & Ferrante, 2000). The structures with an attached sunspace were shown to have  higher temperatures than those without by up to 5°C in the coolest climate (Dublin), which is beneficial  in January, but causes overheating problems in July.  Further tests conducted on the same space in the  Milan climate only, showed that maximum air temperatures in the sunspace were approximately 1°C  and 5°C lower in January and July respectively when the concrete floor was exchanged for a planted  grass floor. This amounts to a reduction in the effectiveness of heat supply in the winter, but a cooling  effect of up to 6°C for the attached structure in the summer. Lastly, a double glazed sunspace  demonstrated higher temperatures in the winter and lower temperatures in the summer; this second  result does not seem to align with the results of other studies consulted below.  Swann (1996) also investigated adding a glazed space to a simulated residential house in London,  connected with a glazed wall. In the winter, heat loss through the glazed space demanded increased  energy for space heating, which was counteracted only by increasing the resistance of the glazing.  However, in the summer the unventilated glazed space increased the hours of overheating in the  adjacent rooms, and this period of overheating increased with higher insulation values of the glass.  Adding thermal mass to the floor of the glazed space, in replacement of a carpet floor, was not found to  5   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    reduce peak temperatures or improve the number of comfortable hours. Through various different  configurations of the glazed space's construction, envelope and orientation, little energy saving was  found with a glazed space simply in "buffer mode", that is, with no active transfer of heat to or from the  residential space. The buffer effect, as described by Swann, derives from the fact that the glazed space is  always a few degrees above ambient temperature even under overcast skies, thereby providing a buffer  to the residential space against heat loss. This effect becomes more prominent when the residential  space is less well insulated, suggesting another avenue for investigation beyond the research study  following, perhaps indicating the type of building most suited for a retrofit involving an attached glazed  space.   Finally, another study investigated a glazed space integrated into a computer simulated end unit row  house of typical construction, in the climate of Zurich, Switzerland (Hastings, 1981). The scenario run  with a double glazed envelope on the sunspace yielded the highest temperatures in the sunspace,  agreeing with the result found by Swann (1996), but contrary to the results of Mihalakakou & Ferrante  (2000). Overall, the house with an attached sunspace required more heat in the coldest part of winter  than a house without a sunspace, but the difference was recovered in the shoulder seasons (fall/spring).  It was also shown that a house with a well insulated wall in the area common to the house and sunspace  had a smaller annual heating load than with an uninsulated dividing wall. Each of these variables was  investigated with the rooftop greenhouse herein, the expectation being that many of the same trends  would be observed.  Therefore, most importantly:     Latent heat dissipation by green roof plants and reflection by high albedo surfaces are shown  to lessen the cooling load of attached spaces (Jaffal et al., 2012; Jo et al., 2010).  The use of greenhouse envelopes with high resistance can help to reduce overall energy  consumption (Scott, 2011).  A well insulated rooftop greenhouse and office envelope result in a smaller reduction of  energy consumption than poorly insulated envelopes (though with active venting, the  greenhouse is found to reduce energy consumption) (Delor, 2011).   An attached sunspace causes the host structure to be warmer year round, though may cause  overheating in the summer; a planted area in the sunspace can lead to a cooling effect  reducing instances of overheating (Mihalakakou & Ferrante, 2000). 

6   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE     The "buffer effect" is found to provide little overall energy savings to the attached structure  when there is no active transfer of heat from the sunspace (Swann, 1996); however active  venting of heat from greenhouse could significantly reduce energy consumption (Delor, 2011;  Scott, 2011).   Structures with an attached sunspace need more heating in winter, but make up for the  difference (i.e. requires less heating when sunspace is present) in the shoulder seasons  (Hastings, 1981).

3. ObjectivesandResearchQuestions
This research explores the impact of an urban rooftop greenhouse on the annual heating and cooling  energy requirement of the greenhouse and the host office building below. The broader purpose of the  research is to establish whether there is value, beyond local produce, in providing urban agriculture on a  rooftop.  This concept follows from previous research examining the impact of attached sunspaces on their host  building, as well as other rooftop greenhouses connected to structures of various occupancy. Findings  suggest that the parameters of the glazed space can be modified to decrease heating and/or cooling  requirements in the host building although some studies suggest that without active heat transfer (by a  ventilation system, or otherwise) this effect is not large (Hastings, 1981; Swann, 1996). The research is  also informed by studies of the effect of green roofs on the energy performance of buildings.  Research  has found that green roofs provide reductions in the heating and cooling load of buildings through  evapotranspiration of plants, and shading from foliage (Jaffal et al., 2012; Niachou et al., 2001). This  research will examine the impact of these parameters as they apply to integrated rooftop greenhouses.  Specifically, several factors were tested using IESVE energy simulation software to determine their level  of impact on a simulated greenhouse, and midrise office building. The four major questions addressed  in this research are outlined below.   i. How does the level of insulation in the area of roof common to both structures impact the total  heating and cooling requirement of the greenhouse, and the office building below?  ii. How does the addition of thermal mass in the greenhouse affect the total heating and cooling  requirement?  iii. What effect do the properties of the greenhouse envelope have on the heating and cooling  requirement?   iv. What effect do evapotranspiration and supplementary greenhouse lighting have on the heating  and cooling requirement?  The research sought specifically to determine whether there is an impact on the energy required for  heating and cooling in both structures due to crops and supplementary lighting, insulation in the area of  roof common to both structures, a changing greenhouse envelope and thermal mass in the greenhouse.  By changing these variables in a simulation model, trends were shown indicating whether  interconnectedness of the pair benefits the total heating/cooling load of the systems combined, or not.  8   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    The ultimate goal is a reduction in the total energy necessary for heating and cooling to maintain  occupant thermal comfort in the office building, and appropriate growing conditions year round in the  greenhouse.  The study herein used for analysis a simulated hydroponic agricultural greenhouse, operated year round  on the rooftop of a simulated midrise detached office building. The heating, ventilation and air  conditioning (HVAC) systems were separate for each structure to allow for independent simulation of  the greenhouse and the office building, and to distinguish to what extent each structure is impacted by  their connection.

4. Methodology
4.1 Baselineconditions
The office building was designed to represent a typical sixstorey, steel frame building located in  Toronto. The baseline office building remained the same through all iterations, except for the level of  roof insulation which was modified to collect data for the first and second research questions. The  greenhouse was designed based on the office building roof conditions and geometry, and information  from the Lufa Farms greenhouse; simplified as required. Full specifications are included below.  4.1.1 Simulationsoftware Initially, the host office building and greenhouse were designed and modelled in IES Virtual Environment  (IESVE 6.4.0.12). For this research, the energy modelling software was used evaluate trends in the  energy required annually for heating and cooling in a greenhouse and office building with changing  variables and configurations, for a total of 75 simulations. The software was also used to gather data on  parameters associated with each simulation such as indoor environment and heat flux through  assemblies.  Research has been done previously on a rooftop greenhouse, the Seawater greenhouse in London, with  a method of calculation developed in the European Passive Solar Handbook (Goulding et al., 1992).  Unlike research done using hand calculations, IESVE simulation software was chosen to avoid many of  the simplifying hypotheses innate in hand calculations and offer the highest level of precision available.  IESVE was also chosen for the industry professionals readily available to verify the accuracy of model  inputs (Tristan Truyens  DIALOG, Xiangjin Yang ­ MCW Consultants Ltd.). The ApacheHVAC module in  IES offered maximum controllability of the HVAC system, and allowed manipulation and monitoring of  individual HVAC components which would not have been possible with a more simplified software  interface such as that of eQUEST. The MacroFlo module controls natural ventilation, which was  customized to reflect natural ventilation in a greenhouse.  4.1.2 Weatherdata In examining weather data, the hope was to find that a downtown urban weather file would exhibit  diurnal variations in the drybulb temperature consistent with an urban heat island effect. This could  represent a major factor in the reduction of energy of urban rooftop greenhouses, i.e.  Lufa Farms in  Montreal, which uses much less energy to operate than an exposed, rural greenhouse. However, IES  software has limited weather data builtin, therefore the Toronto weather file used could not easily be  compared with a rural file to learn whether the expected differences exist. Future research should  10   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    ensure the Toronto urban weather file demonstrates the effect of the city's thermal mass, or else use a  different file with weather data taken from downtown. Alternatively, a study may be done adding  adjacent buildings directly to the energy model as a form of thermal mass to observe their effect on the  greenhouse, or even simply changing the level of thermal mass present in the construction of the host  building.   4.1.3 Officebuildingdesign The office building (Figure 1) is assumed to have sufficient structural capacity to support a rooftop  greenhouse, and is located in an area with access to unobstructed sunlight, which is not likely to change  (i.e. reasonable height zoning limitations exist in the area). The existing roof, without a greenhouse, is  dark coloured, and nonreflective. The addition of a rooftop greenhouse is assumed to comply with  zoning limitations. Finally, the office building is located in an area with a sufficient residential population  as might benefit from local agriculture.

The baseline building is built to the standards set out in ASHRAE's Advanced Energy Design Guide  (AEDG) for Small to Medium Office Buildings where applicable, as the designed office building matches  the scope of the guide in floor area, and occupancy (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, 2011).  The office building was divided into 7 thermal zones per floor (Figure 2), according to the  recommendations for zoning set out in the EE4 Modelling Guide (Natural Resources Canada, 2008). Each  zone was given internal loads corresponding to their use as laid out in the ASHRAE 90.1 standard, for  11   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    equipment, lighting, and occupancy. The ASHRAE 90.12007 specified loads are built into IES software  (magnitude, and daily profiles including weekdays, weekends and holidays) and were therefore adopted  automatically, though the standard may also be consulted (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating  and AirConditioning Engineers, 2010).

4.1.4 Greenhousebaselinedesign The greenhouse is designed to cover the largest area of the roof possible, approximately 70% of the  office building roof, to deliver the maximum floortowallarea ratio, in an eastwest orientation for  maximum solar radiation capture. It is set back from the edge of the roof to allow for maintenance,  some HVAC exits where necessary, and for compliance with fire code (i.e. glazing, in an urban fabric,  requires a minimum separation from adjacent buildings). The setback is a minimum of 2.3 m diagonally  at the corners, as compared with 2 m on all sides at Lufa Farms (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Office roof plan, greenhouse footprint 

The greenhouse is a typical Venlo design ­ multispan construction with gable roofs ­ based on the  operating rooftop greenhouse of Lufa Farms in Montreal; 4.2 m to the gutter, and an additional 1.5 m to  the gable (Figure 4). The greenhouse used by Lufa Farms in Montreal was manufactured by Westbrook  Greenhouse Systems Ltd., and is the `Solar' greenhouse model: a multispan, curved glass greenhouse.  The geometry was simplified in order to input the design into IESVE simulation software; a pointed  gable roof instead of curved vaults. Curved glass is, however, ideal in practice because it allows for  maximum light transmission to the plants, optimizing their growth (Hadley, 2011).

Figure 4: Standalone greenhouse, axonometric 

The greenhouse envelope options were developed in consultation with Gord Bonisteel, owner and  operator of V&V Agricultural Greenhouses in Kingsville, Ontario, and Guardian Glass, a glass  manufacturer that supplies glass for greenhouses, among other applications. Shading in a greenhouse by  the roof structure is typically between 56%, while the structure of the greenhouse accounts for an  additional 3% shading (G. Bonisteel, personal communication, May 30, 2013); therefore the overall  vision area of the glass is 91%. The recommended glazing for a greenhouse is 4mm tempered single  pane glass, which has both high visible transmittance for good crop growth and high impact resistance  for durability (Guardian Glass, personal communication, May 30, 2013).   The properties of the single glazed glass were obtained directly from Guardian Glass. The centreofglass  Uvalue was input into IES software which automatically calculated the total Uvalue arising from the  window construction based on the window to frame area, with aluminum mullions. The other  greenhouse envelope assemblies are described in detail, including this baseline, in the section Effect of  thermal mass (page 35).  When the greenhouse is simulated as a standalone structure, the underslab insulation is at a baseline of  RSI 2.64 m2K/W which corresponds with the CMHC recommendation for insulated slab on grade  foundations, i.e. 50mm (2") of Type II, III, IV rigid foam (Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation,  2000).  

15   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    The greenhouse is heated using the equivalent of radiators run by a high efficiency condensing boiler,  though in the software the energy is drawn by direct acting electric heaters with a 90% efficiency  (representing the efficiency of the condensing boiler). The energy reported should be the same over an  annual period, as auxiliary HVAC equipment (associated pumps and fans) is not being considered. Any  differences may result from the lack of a performance curve with direct acting electric heaters, which  would be associated with a boiler. Additionally, there may be small difference in diurnal temperature  fluctuations between a gas radiator system and electric heaters because of how they are controlled; this  will be kept in mind when evaluating daily results. There is no dedicated cooling system in the  greenhouse, only mechanical and natural ventilation. The cooling energy is considered to be the energy  of the ventilation fans.  The greenhouse setpoint temperatures are based on those at the Lufa Farms rooftop greenhouse, which  are 22°C during the day in the heating season, 18°C at night, and 26°C in the cooling season, though  outdoor temperatures are maintained when appropriate with ventilation. In the Lufa Farms greenhouse,  cooling season temperatures are achieved with an evaporative pad cooling system in addition to  ventilation, while in this model a simplified ventilationonly system was used. Additionally in future  work, the greenhouse cooling system should maintain the relative humidity at 6080% for crop growth,  to maintain hydration and prevent mould growth (L. Rathmell, personal communication, May 6, 2013;  Agriculture and AgriFood Canada, 1987). The very minimum recommended temperature in a  greenhouse is 10°C, however lettuce, tomato and cucumber night temperatures should be in the range  of 1318°C (5565°F) (Aldrich & Bartok, 1994). Plant development is hinged on the daily average  temperature, which is recommended to be around 21°C. With a setpoint of22°C in the heating season,  the average is approximately correct.  The basic internal loading was set based on ASHRAE 90.1 Spacebyspace method for `Active storage',  with a moderate equipment and lighting load (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, 2010). This moderate loading was recommended to best represent limited  equipment use, and periodic task lighting (separate from supplementary crop lighting) (T. Truyens,  personal communication, May 28, 2013).   Various rules of thumb exist to size a mechanical ventilation system, the most common of which  recommends that the system be capable of changing the volume of the greenhouse in 23 minutes  (Agriculture and AgriFood Canada, 1987). This translates to a capacity of between 2700040000 L/s. The  greenhouse ventilation fans were autosized by IES to 5000 L/s, as much of the ventilation volume  16   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    required is achieved through natural ventilation. The fan capacity was tested early on at 20000 L/s with  very little change observed to temperatures in the greenhouse, therefore remained at 5000 L/s total for  testing.  Because there was no active cooling in the greenhouse, a certain lack of controllability was accepted in  the simulations. The ventilation system allowed the greenhouse to maintain temperatures between 21 38°C with lows of not less than 10°C. These maximum and minimum temperatures were tracked for  each simulation, and while they are not maintained for long periods of time, they are indicative of the  effectiveness of both building integration and the variable under examination. In the summer,  temperatures approaching the maximum are reached on almost a daily basis, while the minimum  temperatures (when they fall far below the setpoint temperature) are typically only reached a dozen or  fewer times in the heating season and seem mostly to indicate that the HVAC system has trouble  adjusting quickly to changing internal loads; an improvement that should be explored in future systems.  Additionally, no attempt at humidification was made in the greenhouse, other than the latent load  added to represent crop evapotranspiration (see Effect of evapotranspiration & high pressure sodium  light models, page 46), but represents an opportunity for valuable future research on the maintenance  of an ideal greenhouse interior climate. This is largely contingent on having a detailed internal loading  strategy for greenhouse plants, as they will greatly inform both the relative humidity and temperature.   A summary of the model input parameters for the greenhouse are listed in Table 2.

4.1.5 Evapotranspirationmodel An important consideration in this study is the inability of IESVE software to model crops directly,  although evapotranspiration may have a large impact on thermal relationships. In place of plants, an  interior latent load was incorporated to mimic the presence of plants (T. Truyens, personal  17   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    communication, April 25, 2013). This substitution does not fully represent the dynamic benefit of the  presence of plants, and suggests an opportunity for further research using more advanced energy  modelling software with this capability.   In their investigation of the effects of exterior climactic conditions on greenhouse crop transpiration,  Boulard & Wang (2000) indicate that in closed greenhouses (i.e. much of the growing season in Toronto,  due to the cold), heat and water vapour released from crops will accumulate in the greenhouse because  of the boundary between interior and exterior; at equilibrium, the crops' transpiration rate will respond  closely to external factors, specifically net radiation received.  The dissertation by Stanghellini (1987)  concerning the effect of microclimate on crop transpiration in the Dutch climate was one of the original  models developed to predict transpiration levels in a greenhouse, and indicated that in a moderate  climate (specifically that of the Netherlands), net radiation could be used to determine levels of  transpiration of a tomato crop in a greenhouse, based on constant interior temperature and humidity.   The final model was developed by taking an average of the daily maximum global radiance values for  each month from the IES Toronto weather file, to establish a peak value for conversion to a transpiration  level using charts developed by Stanghellini (1987). Two transpiration levels were calculated from the  charts as a function of the average monthly temperature and humidity (also calculated based on  information in the Toronto weather file), first during the day, then at night. The transpiration latent load  was kept constant during the night since the level of radiance does not change (no sun, no radiance).  The load was assumed to peak at midday (noon), at the transpiration level determined with  Stanghellini's charts. From sunrise to midday, the level would increase from night time levels to the  peak, and from midday to sunset, the level dropped back to the night time level. An example of a profile  is shown in Figure 5, where the yaxis demonstrates at what percentage the transpiration level is set,  based on a maximum (100%) of 205W/m2, latent load.

Figure 5: Transpiration profile for typical day in January 

The level of transpiration chosen by this method is assumed to be an average of the plants' lifecycle ­ as  seedlings tend to transpire less than mature plants, which transpire more before harvest than after ­  therefore the greenhouse will contain plants at all stages. Evaporation from the media growing the  plants was assumed to be negligible, as in hydroponic setups with minimal openings from the water  circulation channels (where the roots sit) to the environment.  In a warm climate, like the Mediterranean, where the greenhouse interior climate is more closely  coupled to the exterior environment, because of natural ventilation/open windows etc., Boulard &  Wang (2000) note how previously developed models for a moderate climate do not stand up. Because of  the level of natural ventilation required in this simulated greenhouse, the Mediterranean climate model  may more accurately represent the warm season in Toronto. The level of information needed to create  a model using Mediterranean data was not available, so a comparison could not be made. The  development of a comprehensive Torontobased plant transpiration model will be an important  improvement for future research.  4.1.6 Supplementarylightingmodel A model for lighting was also created, specifically high pressure sodium (HPS) lights, which are typically  used in greenhouses for lighting in times of low sunlight to maintain plant photosynthesis. HPS lights  may provide 1541% of the heating requirement of a greenhouse, although it is a very inefficient  method of heating (Gomez, Morrow, Bourget, Massa, & Mitchell, 2013). Therefore this lighting, used  primarily in the heating season (SeptemberApril), is treated as a sensible heat gain. 

19   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    The schedule was developed to begin extending the day length in September, based specifically on  sunrise and sunset times for Toronto, to achieve 17 hours of light for the plants in the greenhouse. The  period when the lights are on continues to lengthen (based, again, on sunrise and sunset) until they are  on for the full 17 hours between December and February. For March and April, they are off at midday  and only extend day length as in SeptemberNovember (Boulianne, 2011). Another method for  controlling supplementary light in the greenhouse is to have it come on when a specific low light level is  achieved in the greenhouse. This system involves more sophisticated controls, but may conserve energy,  since lights are only on when absolutely necessary, while maintaining appropriate light levels for crops in  the greenhouse (L. Rathmell, personal communication, June 12, 2013). Alternative supplementary  lighting control is therefore important for future research.  The target for supplementary irradiance is 815W/m2 for HPS lights on tomatoes/cucumbers (Aldrich &  Bartok, 1994; Argus Controls, 2010). For the purposes of this lighting model, an average of 10W/m2 was  taken (6700lux). It was assumed that 75% of the floor area will be planted and therefore require  lighting.  The number of fixtures, N, required for the area was determined using the following formula (Aldrich &  Bartok, 1994):        6700 117 986 0.75 / 400 105 

Alternatively, the Government of Alberta in a greenhouse construction guide recommends rows of lights  spaced at 3.6m, with lights every 2.7m along the rows, for a conservative total of 81 fixtures over the  greenhouse area (Calpas, 2003). This aligns well with assumptions above.   Therefore 105 fixtures, for a typical 400 W fixture, over 986 m2 sets the power consumption at 43 W/m2.  Of that power input, approximately 70% is converted to heat (Gomez et al., 2013), yielding a total  sensible gain of 30 W/m2 ­ therefore the sensible heat gain when the lighting is turned on is set to be  30W/m2 in the simulation model.  For every other variable, the greenhouse is setup with only moderate internal loads. The greenhouse  will act as a simple buffer zone on the top level of the office building. It was decided that this interior  loading is sufficient to give results for possible benefits to the heating and cooling loads of the office 

20   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    building and greenhouse, and their respective environments, while also removing the possibility of  inaccuracies in these rudimentary ET and HPS lighting models.  4.1.7 Baselineresults As described above, both the office and the greenhouse were assigned baseline configurations: typical  insulation levels of 5.28 m2K/W in the office roof and 2.64 m2K/W in the greenhouse slab, a single glazed  no coating greenhouse envelope, and moderate internal loads, in addition to unchanging temperature  setpoints and other construction/system information.   As an initial comparison, the office building was modelled alone at its baseline, and then checked against  the average Canadian office building energy consumption given by BOMA: 394 kWh/m2yr (BOMA  Canada, 2011). The greenhouse was also modelled separately as a standalone structure. In the final  model, the greenhouse was stacked on the office building for the buildingintegrated simulations (Figure  6). 

 
Figure 6: Buildingintegrated vs. standalone office and greenhouse IES simulation models 

Through all simulations, nothing about the office building or greenhouse changed except for the variable  in question. After each variable was changed, the HVAC system was autosized by the program for  maximum energy efficiency. Finally, a full simulation was run, for a one year period, with data collection  intervals every 10 minutes.   The temperature in the office and greenhouse were checked each time to ensure they remained within  limits acceptable for plant growth (both temperature and relative humidity) and human occupancy,  although when it was not possible the results were noted. The maximum and minimum temperatures in  the greenhouse were collected after each simulation as another comparison of the effect of each  variable. 

21   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    Then the heating and cooling energy of the office building and the greenhouse were analyzed both  separately, and as an overall energy consumption; both as standalone (SA) structures and as two halves  of a buildingintegrated (BI) system (as shown above in Figure 6). Comparisons between the SA  structures allow for an evaluation of which structure benefits most from the connection through each  variable tested. Comparisons of the BI energy consumption for heating and cooling over each simulation  indicate whether there is an overall benefit to the symbiosis, and help predict what variables may be  most appropriate for future rooftop greenhouses and their host buildings.  A comparison of energy savings between simulations was conducted based on trends in the results. Any  percentages assigned to savings do not represent absolute numbers, but are used as a tool to assess the  magnitude of the trend, allowing that an unknown margin of error exists between the simulation model  and real world settings. 

4.2 Variables
4.2.1 Roofinsulation For this variable, both the SA office building roof insulation, and the level of insulation between the  office and rooftop greenhouse were increased in each simulation by 1.76 m2K/W from no insulation. In  total, they are tested at RSI 0, 0.88, 1.76, 3.52, 5.28, 7.04, 8.81 and 10.6 m2K/W for a total of eight  iterations each, where RSI 5.28 m2K/W is considered the baseline for the office building roof  (recommendation from ASHRAE AEDG for Small to Medium Office Buildings). The roof assembly is  described in Table 3 (note: the specific heat capacities are given per unit weight, not volume). The  underslab greenhouse insulation is similarly tested. The baseline for the greenhouse slab is set at RSI  2.64 m2K/W and is therefore a ninth iteration in the case of the SA greenhouse including all the values  listed above.  
Table 3: Office building roof assembly for standalone and building integrated simulations

In the BI scenario, the changing levels of insulation affect only the area common to the rooftop  greenhouse and the office building, i.e. the greenhouse footprint. For consistency, this area of changing  insulation remains the same when testing the SA office building, even though a rooftop greenhouse is 

22   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    not present. The perimeter of the office roof remains at the baseline in all simulations (RSI 5.28 m2K/W)  in order to avoid mixing results with widely varied levels of insulation exposed to external conditions  (Figure 7). Depending on the results, the roof would have to be carefully detailed to reflect different  levels of insulation in the greenhouse footprint vs. the perimeter. Future work may also investigate what  level of insulation would be most beneficial when changing the entire roof, instead of only the  greenhouse footprint.   For clarification, the area common to the rooftop greenhouse and office building will be referred to as  the greenhouse footprint. As mentioned above, all simulations are run with baseline constructions,  systems and setpoints, changing only the insulation variable. 

 
Figure 7: Office roof plan showing area of changing insulation for standalone and building integrated simulations 

The results were analyzed to determine what level of insulation is most beneficial to the office building,  the greenhouse, and the system (office + greenhouse), i.e. offers the lowest annual heating and cooling  energy consumption. 4.2.2 Thermalmass Thermal mass was incorporated into the greenhouse for load shedding by modifying the roof assembly  of the office building so that the concrete layer was exposed to the rooftop greenhouse (Table 4). The  flipped assembly was tested with the same levels of insulation as in the previous roof insulation  simulations, except placed below the concrete slab. 

23

To provide extra evidence for the effect of thermal mass on the greenhouse, the concrete in the BI  separation was replaced entirely with a thin layer of insulation having an equivalent thermal resistance,  but a negligible thermal mass. This was tested alongside RSI 5.28 m2K/W, as well as no additional  insulation. Secondly, the layer of concrete in the separation was doubled, and also tested with RSI 5.28  m2K/W, and no insulation. As before in the roof insulation simulations, the only area being modified is  the footprint of the greenhouse, unless specifically mentioned otherwise.  The SA greenhouse from the first round of simulations already had its thermal mass facing the space,  since the insulation was underslab. Therefore, here, it was retested using overslab insulation to explore  the difference in the SA greenhouse of having thermal mass. Similarly, the office building was tested  with RSI 5.28 m2K/W insulation in the roof, flipped so that the concrete layer was to the exterior,  externalizing the thermal mass.   4.2.3 Greenhouseenvelope The greenhouse envelope was tested in several stages; first by modifying the glass from single pane to  double pane, increasing the thermal resistance of the envelope. Simulations were also run with low  emissivity reflective coatings, and double glazing to observe the effect that their insulative properties  have on the energy requirement of the system, while noting the effect that the new conditions (such as  a decrease in visible transmittance) may have on plant growth.  Additionally, adding a thermal reflective  night curtain was explored as another modification to the greenhouse envelope.   Using the baseline single pane greenhouse glazing to begin, a lowemissivity coating was chosen. The  double pane glass is simply two layers of the single pane, with a 9.5 mm airspace; a lowe coating is  added on the second surface, with an emissivity of 0.18. As recommended by the technical department  at Guardian Glass, LBNL Window 6 software was used to obtain the established properties of the glass  assemblies for their products for the remaining glazing types. The vision area remains the same in every  simulation.  The results are compiled in Table 5.

Each different glazing type was tested with the baseline insulation level, followed by no insulation in the  BI separation, and SA greenhouse slab (Figure 8), and analyzed in comparison with baseline SA  simulations to find the most efficient greenhouse envelope. 

 
Figure 8: Insulation level scenarios for greenhouse glazing and ET/HPS lights 

Another method of analysis for specific simulations involved taking temperature readings on either side  of the roof assembly (Figure 9) that were converted into a heat flux using the following equation (Yu,  Gao, & Gong, 2010): 

25   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE      Where,  Qr = heat flux through the roof (W/m2)  U = overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m2K) (changes with varying levels of insulation)  To = outdoor surface temperature, or greenhouse temperature  Ti = indoor surface temperature  A positive value indicates heat flow from the exterior to the interior of the office building, while a  negative value indicates the opposite. This provides another reference point to help determine and  describe the mechanism by which some results are influenced. 

 
Figure 9: Schematic of temperature readings for calculating heat flux between office and greenhouse 

4.2.4 Evapotranspirationandhighpressuresodiumlights After developing these models, the greenhouse was tested with three different interior load setups.  First, it was given moderate lighting, equipment and occupancy loads. Next, the evapotranspiration (ET)  model was input in the model as a latent load that turns on and off based on plant transpiration rates.  The latent load of ET was added in addition to the initial moderate lighting/equipment interior loading.   Finally, the model for high pressure sodium (HPS) crop lights was added, representing a sensible heat  load when the lights are turned on, as the lights can provide 1541% of the heating load of a greenhouse  (Gomez et al., 2013). The sensible load of HPS lights was added to both the initial moderate internal  loads and ET.  All three sets of internal loads were tested in a SA greenhouse with baseline (RSI 2.64 m2K/W) underslab  insulation and no insulation, and a BI baseline system with RSI 5.28 m2K/W insulation in the separation  26   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    and no insulation (equivalent to Figure 8 above). After the thermal mass simulations had been  completed, it was decided to add a third scenario, so the three sets of internal loads were also tested in  a SA greenhouse with insulation over the slab to eliminate the benefit of thermal mass in the  greenhouse.  The models including ET loads were scrutinized based on the cooling energy consumption of the  greenhouse and office building vs. the moderate loads calculated previously. This helps to ascertain  whether an evaporative cooling effect results from plant ET that could influence the office building  when the greenhouse is building integrated, as green roofs have been shown to be in other studies  (Jaffal et al., 2012; Niachou et al., 2001).  4.2.5 SummaryofSimulations

5. ResultsandAnalysis
5.1 BaselineResults
The BI scenarios are considered as if they are built together at the same time, not as a retrofit rooftop  greenhouse, i.e. the HVAC system is sized appropriately for every scenario.   The intent to compare the energy consumption of the baseline model to the Canadian national average  for office buildings in order to calibrate the computer simulation model has been found to be  inappropriate for several reasons. First, some office buildings included in the Canadian data set include  data centres and other amenities, which are large energy consumers. Perhaps for this reason, BOMA  Canada reports that small office buildings (under 9,290 m2, or 100,000 ft2) tend to perform on average  18% better than larger office buildings (BOMA Canada, 2011). Additionally, the simulation model was  designed to meet the ASHRAE AEDG for Small to Medium Office Buildings (American Society of Heating,  Refrigerating and AirConditioning Engineers, 2011), which means that its energy consumption should  already be better than average. The energy modelling software shows that the energy consumption of  the current simulated six storey detached office building is only 200 kWh/m2 annually, as compared with  the Canadian average of 392 kWh/m2. However the Canadian average represents all existing office  buildings in Canada, not all of which comply with the more stringent building and energy codes of today.  The energy use in the current simulation falls into the best performing quartile of BOMA best buildings,  which consume between 110225 kWh/m2 annually (BOMA Canada, 2011).  Moreover, a relative validation was achieved through collaboration with two energy modelling  professionals who pointed out errors, and suggested ways to change the model to better represent  reality. Therefore, while the model may still suffer from a level of inaccuracy without having been  calibrated to measured data from an existing building, it has achieved a level of precision that can with  confidence be used to generate relative comparisons between different variables pertaining to a rooftop  greenhouse. Although these comparisons will not give absolute numerical results, they are expected to  show a positive or negative effect and ascribe an order of magnitude to any changes observed to  heating and cooling requirements when variables are modified.  The modelled office building, to ASHRAE AEDG for Small to Medium Office Buildings standards, gave the  following outputs (Table 7):

The results used to compare different simulations are specifically the annual space heating and space  cooling energy. For the office, the heating energy is annual energy drawn by the boilers, and cooling is  chiller energy, as highlighted in red (Table 7).  For the greenhouse, the heating energy represents boilers (see Greenhouse baseline design, p. 13). In  the simulations where HPS supplementary lighting is included, 70% of the supplementary lighting energy  (based on the estimated efficiency of the light source) is included in heating energy. The cooling energy  for the greenhouse is considered to be the energy of ventilation, i.e. fans. No other energy use is  reported in the results, including auxiliary HVAC equipment (pumps, fans), lighting, equipment etc.; only  the heating and cooling energy highlighted in red.  Greenhouses typically use between 315.4788.7 kWh/m2 (100000250000 Btu/ft2) to maintain  temperatures in the heating season, and 3.5910.76kWh/m2 (1/31 Btu/ft2) over the cooling season  (Aldrich & Bartok, 1994). The SA greenhouse with a typical level of underslab insulation (RSI 2.64  m2K/W), and minimal interior loads uses 787.9 kWh/m2 for heating, and 4.94 kWh/m2 for ventilation, as  determined from the information in Table 8 and the greenhouse footprint of 986.4m2. Therefore the  greenhouse simulation model heating and cooling (i.e. ventilation) energy is within the limits of a typical  greenhouse.   However, even with maximum ventilation the greenhouse still reaches temperatures up to 38°C many  times throughout the summer, for hours at a time. Even when manually changing the fan capacity to  20000 L/s (4 times autosized capacity), very little change is observed in the peak temperature; the  greenhouse is cooler for a slightly longer period, and the fan energy is increased greatly. Therefore it  appears as though ventilation is not enough to keep the greenhouse cool year round in the Toronto  climate; further research into climateappropriate cooling systems for Toronto is required. With the 

29   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    addition of a dedicated cooling system in the greenhouse, the ventilation load would likely decrease,  and the cooling energy would be very different, based on a different method of cooling other than fans.  The results from the baseline standalone greenhouse are demonstrated in Table 8:

Baseline results for comparison with simulations below refer to sum of the heating and cooling energy  requirements of the SA office building with RSI 5.28 m2K/W insulation in the roof (Table 7), and the SA  greenhouse with RSI 2.64 m2K/W underslab insulation, single glazing and moderate internal loads (Table  8). This best represents the standalone structures in reality, although the configuration of insulation  (above deck in the office roof, underslab for greenhouse) gives a thermal mass advantage to both SA  structures. In BI scenarios, the thermal mass typically only benefits one structure, and this inequality is  discussed further below.  With the baseline results established, the four variables ­ insulation, thermal mass, the greenhouse  envelope and supplementary greenhouse lighting ­ were examined. 

5.2 Effectofroofinsulation
As expected, increasing levels of insulation in the SA office roof led to decreasing annual energy  consumption for both heating and cooling. Similarly, increasing levels of insulation in the slab assembly  of the SA greenhouse decreased heating energy, but caused an increase in the requirement for cooling,  suggesting that the ground was having a moderating effect on the interior greenhouse temperature in  the cooling season (Table 9).    For the BI system, the results show the simulation with no insulation in the greenhouse footprint as  having the lowest annual heating and cooling energy of all simulations, as well as the lowest number of  overheating hours (Table 9; Figure 10). Additionally, in this simulation, the maximum temperature is  shown to be lower in the BI than the SA greenhouse while the minimum temperature is higher; this  appears to be a beneficial effect of building integration.

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    The next simulation with RSI 0.88 m2K/W insulation similarly performed at lower overall heating and  cooling energy than the superinsulated separations (RSI 7.0410.6 m2K/W). In the following two  simulations, RSI 1.76 and 3.52 m2K/W the BI system performed much differently, so much so that the  software experienced instability both times. In the end, the only solution was to run the simulations  using a much shorter timestep between calculations; 2 minutes and 6 minutes for RSI 1.76 and 3.52  m2K/W respectively, instead of the typical 10 minutes. The annual results when run at a shorter time  step tend to be higher therefore the results from these two simulations are less reliable than the other  six points. It remains, however, that there is a trend towards higher heating and cooling energy  consumption, supported further by the simulation done at RSI 5.28 m2K/W which experienced no  instability and still results in a higher energy consumption than both the lowest insulation levels, and the  highest (Figure 10).

If discounting the simulations with 1.76 and 3.52 m2K/W  insulation (because of the instability in the  simulation model), the BI office building does not differ in annual heating energy by more than 1%, and  even including those simulations, not by more than 2% (Figure 11). This indicates that even when no  insulation is present in the separation (and since the greenhouse envelope itself has little resistance),  some property of the greenhouse must be providing a measure of heat, to be able to maintain the  setpoint temperatures in both spaces during the heating season. This is likely due to the buffer effect as  described by Swann (1996).

Figure 11: Effect of insulation on the annual heating energy of office vs. rooftop greenhouse in BI system 

The trend in energy consumption in the greenhouse can be explained by the effect of thermal mass: the  simulation with no insulation separating the greenhouse from the office building also leaves the 100mm  concrete roof deck exposed to the interior of the greenhouse. When RSI 0.88 m2K/W is added above the  deck, the thermal resistance is still low enough that there is heat penetration into the slab, storing solar  energy for colder periods and reducing the heating load in the greenhouse, though the effect is much  less pronounced. This also explains the trend of increasing heating consumption in the greenhouse (as  the thermal mass is covered up), which levels out with resistances higher than RSI 1.76 m2K/W in the  separation. Overall, the difference between the highest BI energy consumption and the lowest is only  4%, indicating thermal mass has an effect of a small magnitude. This phenomenon is discussed and  tested further below (see Effect of thermal mass, page 35).  Overall, the maximum temperatures in the greenhouse appear to be higher in BI simulations than SA,  and the minimum temperatures lower, which indicates the BI system needs more energy to maintain  setpoint temperatures than the SA. Again, this is likely because the SA greenhouse in these simulations  has the advantage of thermal mass inside the greenhouse which has a moderating effect on the  temperature, while the BI greenhouse does not, except for the simulation with no insulation, as  mentioned above. However, the level of thermal interaction with the office building makes a difference  in the maximum and minimum rooftop greenhouse temperatures  ­ the maximum temperature is 3°C  lower when there is no insulation in the greenhouse footprint (vs. super insulated, RSI 10.6 m2K/W),  while the minimum is 4°C higher. 

33   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    Through the simulations from no insulation to super insulated, the BI office building annual cooling  energy decreases, while the greenhouse ventilation energy increases. This suggests that as the two  structures decrease in thermal connection, the office building needs less cooling in order to compensate  for the additional heat provided by the greenhouse, while the greenhouse begins to require increased  ventilation to maintain acceptable temperatures in the cooling season. However the cooling energy  required for the office decreases in larger quantity than it increases in the greenhouse, as the insulation  level is changed from nothing to RSI 10.6 m2K/W. This indicates that for cooling, a higher level of  thermal separation is more beneficial to the total annual cooling energy. Fundamentally, it takes more  energy to cool the greenhouse with a chiller, than it does to simply replace warm air with cooler outdoor  air, since the setpoint can be higher in the greenhouse than in the office building.   The difference between the highest and lowest energy consumption in the BI simulations was  approximately 1/12 of the difference between the highest and lowest energy SA combined systems  (Table 10). The BI system is therefore not as affected by changes in insulation as the SA structures,  which suggests that the integrated greenhouse and office building have a moderating effect on each  other.   Therefore, out of these simulations testing the level of insulation separating the office from the rooftop  greenhouse, the most beneficial symbiosis happened when there was no insulation separating the two  structures (Table 10). However even this BI system with no insulation in the greenhouse footprint still  performed more poorly than the baseline SA office + SA greenhouse. The comparison, as mentioned  above, is not entirely equal, as the SA greenhouse benefits from the thermal mass of its concrete slab,  however it is the comparison deemed closest to reality. This finding will be examined further in  simulations investigating the effect of having the concrete roof layer exposed to the greenhouse, acting  as thermal mass.

5.3 Effectofthermalmass
Thermal mass is explored as a way of storing solar energy captured by the greenhouse during the day, to  offset some of the energy required for heating at night. The greenhouse floor in these simulations was  modelled as though there was no obstruction of the sunlight on the concrete thermal mass by  tables/benches/equipment etc. Trends shown here would best be reproduced with as little cover on the  floor of the greenhouse as possible, i.e. hanging plants, and furniture with minimum surface area  contact with the ground to leave exposed as much of the thermal mass as possible. Alternatively,  furniture and fixtures in the greenhouse may be designed to have a large thermal mass, or it may be  incorporated otherwise (water barrels, low brick wall around the perimeter, etc.). Future study should  involve the incorporation of obstructions in the greenhouse and/or other forms of thermal mass,  including the effect of shading and transpiration by plants, to view how they impact the effectiveness of  thermal mass.  As discussed previously, it appears from earlier simulations that thermal mass in the greenhouse is a  factor in the annual heating/cooling load of the space. In the roof insulation simulations, the BI system  showed lower total energy consumption when the roof assembly incorporated no insulation.  Speculation suggested this result was due to the concrete thermal mass exposed to the greenhouse  when no insulation was present above the deck.   It is evident from a comparison of energy consumption in the SA greenhouse with insulation over vs.  under the slabongrade that thermal mass has a consistent effect on the heating and cooling energy  required to maintain an acceptable greenhouse environment (Figure 12).

As compared with the roof insulation simulations from above, here the office building portion of the BI  system shows a trend towards more energy for heating and cooling than it did when the insulation was  entirely above deck, likely because of the loss of thermal mass in the space. This is evidenced by a  simulation of the SA office building; the heating energy required is increased when the roof construction  is inverted so the concrete layer is to the exterior of the insulation. However the effect is less than a 1%  increase in energy consumption, which is much less than the benefit that the greenhouse receives from  additional thermal mass when the concrete slab faces the interior of the greenhouse (the model  indicates up to 7%). This is likely because the greenhouse has a higher heating load to begin with  because of the low resistance of its envelope, and the fact that the concrete layer in the greenhouse is  directly exposed to sunlight. Therefore, overall, the BI system with thermal mass in the greenhouse uses  less annual energy than the BI roof insulation simulations above (Table 11; Table 9).   N.B.: Again, the BI simulation with RSI 1.76 m2K/W insulation is unreliable because of instability in the  software.

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    The importance of thermal mass in the greenhouse is evidenced in two additional ways; first by  substituting the concrete roof slab with an equivalent level of insulation. In both examples, equivalent to  the simulations with no additional insulation (therefore only a small layer of insulation representing the  resistance of the concrete) and RSI 5.28 m2K/W, the annual heating/cooling energy are both higher  when no thermal mass is present. Conversely, when the concrete deck is doubled in thickness, the  annual heating/cooling energy is decreased (Figure 13).

As opposed to the simulations with abovedeck insulation, the BI system consistently becomes more  energy efficient as the level of insulation in the greenhouse footprint increases (Table 12). Specifically  the heating requirement in the BI greenhouse decreases as the level of insulation below the concrete  deck increases from no insulation to RSI 10.6 m2K/W. This result indicates that there is another  mechanism other than heat flux through the greenhouse footprint (which is made more difficult with  high levels of insulation) by which the BI systems are improved over their SA counterparts. In the case of  the BI greenhouse, it may simply be that having the thermal mass of the office building adjacent  provides a beneficial effect on the conditioning energy requirement. Further research into this  phenomenon is required, and may benefit from a study of urban thermal mass on greenhouses, which  may also serve to answer why Lufa Farms performs so much better than a groundlevel, rural  counterpart (L. Rathmell, personal communication, May 6, 2013).  

38   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    However, as with the previous roof insulation variable, the simulation with no insulation in the  greenhouse footprint has the lowest hours of overheating (i.e. above 30°C in the greenhouse), almost  certainly because of the heat transfer possible through the greenhouse footprint to the office building,  or the ground for the SA greenhouse. In future research with an active cooling system, this advantage  may not be as important for maintenance of growing conditions in the greenhouse.

Additionally, every BI simulation with thermal mass in the greenhouse (except for the first with no  insulation) has a lower energy consumption for heating and cooling than the baseline SA office + SA  greenhouse (Figure 14).

Figure 14: Comparison of BI systems with thermal mass in the greenhouse vs. the SA baseline 

The BI greenhouse temperatures from the thermal mass simulations are compared with the SA  greenhouse from the previous section (Effect of roof insulation, page 30) since they both benefit from  thermal mass. The comparison shows that the maximum temperatures in the BI scenario are lower than  in the SA greenhouse, while the minimum temperatures are higher, though only by less than 1°C. This 

39   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    indicates a small benefit to integrating the greenhouse with the office building, since the BI systems  have been shown to use less energy to achieve temperatures closer to the setpoint for the greenhouse.  In summary of the first two variables (thermal mass and roof insulation above), Figure 15 shows the  impact of inverting the roof assembly in the greenhouse footprint for BI systems. The simulations with  thermal mass in the greenhouse consistently perform better overall then simulations with insulation  above the roof deck. Additionally, the greenhouse maximum interior temperatures are also 23°C cooler  in the BI greenhouse with thermal mass than with the baseline roof assembly, while the minimum  temperatures are 34°C warmer. This effect is greater than the max and min temperature differences  between the BI and SA greenhouses described above, which were not more than 1°C, i.e. thermal mass  has a greater effect on the temperature in the greenhouse than building integration.

One additional issue to consider is thermal bridging which would likely be more prominent when  insulation is installed below the roof deck, since it may interfere with roof structural members. Building  detailing is not automatically considered by IESVE software, so it assumes perfect continuity in  insulation whether it is above or below the roof deck; this could be achieved with careful detailing.  

5.4 Effectofgreenhouseenvelope
The purpose of a greenhouse envelope is to create an interior environment conducive to plant growth,  which includes, in a northern climate, both thermal resistance, and high visible transmittance in the  range of photosynthetically active radiation of light (PAR), between 400700nm. This corresponds  40   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    closely to the visible spectrum, and therefore translates well to the visible transmittance property of  glazing. The visible transmittance of the cover material can vary depending on the light needs of the  crop grown in the greenhouse, though many agricultural crops typically grown in greenhouses (lettuce,  cucumber, tomatoes) require mid to high light levels to thrive (Aldrich & Bartok, 1994). Ideally, an  agricultural greenhouse will have a visible transmittance of 8990%, although coatings exist on the  market that will increase the visible transmittance to 9596% (G. Bonisteel, personal communication,  May 30, 2013). In general, single pane horticultural glass is preferable to double pane glass, despite a  large energy savings, because of the reduced light transmission both through the glass and resulting  from a heavier support structure, resulting in overall reductions of plant growth and yield (Cohen &  Fuchs, 1999).  The results in Table 13 show, as expected, that as the Uvalue of the glazing decreases in both SA and BI  greenhouses, the annual heating energy also decreases, while cooling energy increases. This indicates  that glazing with better thermal resistance retains more of the heat of the HVAC system and solar  radiation, reducing the energy required for heating, but increasing the level of ventilation necessary to  maintain the setpoint temperatures in the cooling season, which agrees with findings in attached  sunspace research (Hastings, 1981; Swann, 1996).  As shown previously in Figure 8 (in Methodology, page 25), insulation in the BI scenario is above the roof  deck; in retrospect, after the thermal mass simulations, this insulation may be better placed below the  roof deck, exposing the concrete layer's thermal mass to the greenhouse, which it benefits more than  the office building. This presents another opportunity for further research into the overall effect of  greenhouse glazing, when all other variables are maximized for energy efficiency.

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    Overall, the energy consumption of the BI system (office + greenhouse) decreases as the glazing system  improves (decreasing Uvalue); this is consistent with the effect shown by Scott (2011) wherein an  improved greenhouse envelope resulted in a lower heating requirement then single glazing. The  maximum greenhouse temperatures are highest with the best envelope (double glazed, lowe),  consistent with the simulation of attached sunspaces done by Mihalakakou & Ferrante (2000). The  minimum temperatures are lowest with either single glazed or double glazed lowe ­ this indicates that  the single glazed envelope permits heat to escape the greenhouse, while the most improved envelope  allows much less solar radiation to enter. However, in terms of energy consumption, the most beneficial  greenhouse envelope is double glazed with a low emissivity coating on the interior surface of the  exterior pane.   The results also indicate that for the BI scenario, single glazing with a low emissivity coating on the  rooftop greenhouse yields the lowest energy consumption results for the office building below; lower  than both double glazed, and double glazed with a lowe coating (Figure 16). The result is particularly  striking when there is no insulation in the separation between the greenhouse and the office building;  the model suggests a difference of more than 3% between the heating consumption of the office  building with a single lowe envelopegreenhouse and the next best, double glazed, envelope.  Contrarily, the overall BI energy consumption is 6% less when the greenhouse is double glazed vs. single  glazed, lowe.

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    In further exploring the reason for the efficiency of the BI office building with this particular greenhouse  envelope, it was found that the heat flux from the greenhouse to the office building is consistently  greatest throughout the year when the greenhouse envelope is single glazed + lowe coating (Figure 17);  it follows that the floor temperature in the greenhouse is also highest with this envelope. It appears that  the greenhouse is transferring heat to the office building, which explains the lower energy consumption  there, though there is no clear indication why.

The interior temperatures of the differently glazed greenhouses do not show any clear trends to indicate  that one has a higher or lower temperature than another for any significant period during the year,  except that the overheating hours in the single glazed, lowe greenhouse are higher than might be  expected (not linear with the single and double glazed hours). This suggests that the heating/ventilation  systems are working as expected, and are not causing this discrepancy. The temperatures in the office  building below never differ by more than one degree between cases. A second set of simulations was  conducted using default IES glazing constructions to ensure that there was no problem with the custom  constructions input in the software from Guardian Glass/Window 6 specifications. The same trend, to  the same magnitude, was observed in this set of simulations.  Therefore if the goal were to choose the BI scenario that most benefits the energy consumption of the  office building, then a single pane glass with a lowemissivity coating may be the best choice for the  44   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    greenhouse envelope. Further research should be conducted to ensure that this is the case in every  scenario (i.e. when there is thermal mass in the greenhouse and insulation in the separation) and to  discover the reason for this.  The BI simulations with coated and double glazed rooftop greenhouse envelopes all show lower energy  consumption than the SA baseline, and the difference increases as the glazing improves (Table 14). The  greenhouse maximum temperatures appear to be lower in the BI greenhouse then in the SA greenhouse  for the simulations with no insulation in the greenhouse footprint. The minimum temperature was  always higher in the SA greenhouse, and the maximum was less when insulation was present in the  greenhouse footprint, indicating a benefit to the SA greenhouse. However, like the results from the roof  insulation simulations, this SA greenhouse has a layer of concrete thermal mass exposed to the interior,  while the BI greenhouse does not, so the temperatures are not exceptionally comparable. Without  running additional simulations with thermal mass to the interior of the BI greenhouse while varying the  greenhouse envelope, conclusions cannot be drawn based on interior temperatures.

While a thermal curtain was considered for the greenhouse, IESVE software does not allow the screen  to be installed away from the window, as it would ideally hang from the gutters of the greenhouse, 1.5  m below the gable of the roof. Another limitation of the software was its inability to model metallic  coatings on the curtain, since the purpose of thermal night curtains is to prevent thermal radiation loss  from the greenhouse which is most efficiently done with an aluminized curtain (Gupta & Chandra,  2002). One simulation was run using a thin but opaque aluminum layer, arranged horizontally at the  gutters separating the gables of the greenhouse from the lower rectangular prism. The simulation did  not provide any conclusive results as the aluminum partition could not be retracted during the day.  Therefore, in terms of overall energy consumption, the most beneficial greenhouse glazing type is  double glazed with a low emissivity coating. However it is recommended that greenhouse glazing have a  45   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    visible transmittance of at least 89%, so the low visible transmittance of a double glazed, lowe envelope  will likely hinder crop growth. Additionally, the issue of condensation should be explored in future  research as the simulation software gave preliminary indications of condensation on the greenhouse  envelope, which can significantly reduce light transmission to plants in the greenhouse. Exploring other  possible envelope systems including the numerous plastics available would be a logical next step,  investigating combinations of high thermal resistance, and high transmittance. Plastic envelopes are  additionally beneficial because of their lightweight, although they are less durable than glass. 

5.6 Effectofevapotranspiration&highpressuresodiumlightmodels
Evapotranspiration and supplementary lighting models are introduced into the model to show what  effect the interior loading of a functioning rooftop greenhouse might have on the BI system.  In all three scenarios (moderate load, latent load, latent load + lights), the baseline SA office + SA  greenhouse with betterthanaverage insulation levels in the roof and slab respectively, shows a lower  overall heating and cooling energy consumption than any BI scenario, suggesting initially that a rooftop  greenhouse does not provide an overall benefit to this BI configuration (Table 15).  Note, however, that  the SA greenhouse has the benefit of thermal mass, to which the BI greenhouse does not have access  since the BI office roof insulation is entirely above deck (see Figure 8 in Methodology, page 25). With no  insulation in the greenhouse footprint (i.e. maximum thermal interaction), the BI system shows lower  maximum and higher minimum greenhouse temperatures then the SA greenhouse, indicating a benefit  to the interaction.

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    5.6.1 Evapotranspirationload When introducing a latent load in the BI greenhouse, the energy required for ventilation for cooling  dropped slightly  while the heating energy increases by almost 10%  and the hours of overheating are  halved. Figure 18 shows that the increase in heating energy required is most prominent during the  heating season; this may be because the process of transpiration (and the latent load in the simulation  software) requires energy to convert liquid water in the crops to vapour in the air, which in turns  demands more energy from the heating system. This corresponds with an evaporative cooling effect, as  predicted by studies of green roofs (Jaffal et al., 2012). While the greenhouse did require less cooling  when the latent load was added, it also required much more heating, suggesting perhaps that the  cooling effect achieved with a latent load is not beneficial overall in a heating dominated climate. The  changes in energy requirement for heating and cooling when the latent load is introduced are consistent  with results found in the study of an attached sunspace planted with grass (Mihalakakou & Ferrante  2000), though the maximum and minimum temperatures in the greenhouse do not necessarily reflect a  "cooling effect". The minimum temperatures are lower when a latent load is introduced as expected,  while the maximum temperatures remain essentially constant, not demonstrating a cooling effect.

Because of the low outdoor temperatures in the heating season, the ventilation system is typically not  running; the fans are set to come on when the greenhouse interior temperature reaches 26°C. This lack  of ventilation in the presence of a latent load maintains the relative humidity near 100% during the  heating season, which is only slightly improved by ventilation during the cooling season (Figure 19). Even  a reduction of the maximum latent load in the greenhouse by 50% (to a maximum of 100 W/m2, instead  48   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    of 205 W/m2) did not greatly reduce the instance of 100% RH. Attempts to counteract the effect with  exceptionally high ventilation lead to a better climate in the summer, but low temperatures in the  winter.

A significant limitation of this ET model is that the crops in the greenhouse are modelled as being  constantly `on' according to the schedule, and don't respond actively to conditions in the greenhouse. In  reality, the high levels of humidity achieved in the greenhouse with the latent load would effectively halt  plant transpiration (Stanghellini, 1987). The model created assumed levels of transpiration based on  incoming solar radiation, assuming that the temperature and relative humidity in the greenhouse was  maintained near the proper setpoints.  The maintenance of a high relative humidity (6080%) without exceeding 80% for extended periods is  required for optimum crop growth. Therefore in future research involving the energy modelling of  greenhouses, a balance must be found between the plant latent load and a method of dehumidification,  which could amount simply to finer controllability of the ventilation system, or a more reactive model of  plant ET. Further research involving heat recovery from the exhaust air of the greenhouse or the office  building is important to reduce the energy involved in ventilating then reheating the greenhouse in the  heating season.

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    5.6.2 Supplementarylightingload When HPS lights are introduced in the greenhouse the HVAC system heating requirement decreases  because of the waste heat provided by these lights which have only approximately 30% efficiency for  lighting. Table 15 shows 70% of the total lighting power as contributing directly to heating the  greenhouse. Therefore, the HPS lights provide between 8 and 10% of the total heating energy in the  initial simulations; less than what was predicted anecdotally (1541%), which could indicate a high base  greenhouse heating load. Because a proportion of the energy from the HPS lights is converted directly to  heat, this fraction (70%) of their energy is added to the heating energy requirement. Therefore, the total  energy required to heat the greenhouse with HPS lights is higher than without, because of the inferior  efficiency of the lights for heating (as compared with 90% efficient condensing boiler). This problem may  soon be resolved for greenhouse operations requiring supplementary lighting with the adoption of LED  grow lights, poised to begin soon, which require far less energy total, and are much more efficient for  lighting and do not contribute significant heat (Gomez et al., 2013).  The greenhouse maximum temperatures tend to increase when a latent load is added, though the  difference is very small. The simulations run with the latent load of ET during the heating season show  lower minimum temperatures (up to 34°C lower) at night than the greenhouse with moderate loads  (Figure 20). In both systems, the lowest dips are experienced after particularly sunny days (i.e. February  2, and 3). The differences likely have to do with the controllability of the heating system in the  greenhouse, as it is more difficult for the HVAC system to adjust to the loss of heat from solar radiation  when it was sunny and more difficult again when the additional latent load is demanding energy from  the heating system. As mentioned before, however, the total overheating hours in the greenhouse  (above 30°C) are significantly reduced, confirming the cooling effect of the latent load. When the HPS  lights are introduced, the minimum is reduced, most likely because the HPS lights stay on later/turn on  earlier than the sun sets or rises. However in simulations both with insulation and without, maximum  greenhouse temperatures are shown to be lower in the BI greenhouse than the SA greenhouse, and the  minimums higher. Both of these results suggest that the office building has a moderating effect on the  greenhouse, and demonstrate a positive benefit of integrating the greenhouse with the office building.  Future research may focus on ways of controlling the heating system more tightly to prevent excessively  low temperatures in the greenhouse.

Although the cooling load is reduced in the presence of a latent load in all simulations, the temperatures  in the summer still reach between 3038°C daily. While some crops can survive this heat, others are  more delicate and require a more constant low temperature. Lufa Farms aims for a cooling season  setpoint of 26°C, although outdoor temperatures in the summer are acceptable for most crops, and are  maintained using mechanical and natural ventilation (L. Rathmell, personal communication, May 6,  2013). This still results in a lower temperature in reality than was demonstrated in this simulation  model, which is an important avenue for further research: specifically, the controllability of the cooling  system. Future research should investigate methods for preventing overheating in the summer. The use  of an evaporative cooling pad, for example, would change the cooling energy consumption in the  greenhouse entirely.  These observations, compiled in Table 16, highlight the fact that the latent and sensible loads of  greenhouse plants and supplementary lighting are important factors in the annual heating and cooling  load. This is also an important avenue for further research, in which detailed evapotranspiration and  supplementary lighting models should be developed, and used to test energy consumption and  controllability of greenhouse environments.

Overall, therefore, adding a latent load or a latent load + supplementary lighting has been demonstrated  to have a higher overall energy requirement for conditioning. The supplementary lighting showed as  predicted a reduction in HVAC heating energy, replaced in part by HPS lights which are a much less  efficient method of heating, increasing the total energy consumption. The rudimentary models require  further study to make any conclusive statements about the effect of transpiration and supplementary  lighting specifically.  Further research into a more complex HVAC system is an important next step for research regarding  rooftop greenhouses, which should improve controllability of the greenhouse environment with  evapotranspiration and lighting loads, keeping it within ideal ranges at all times, and may provide  additional benefits for the heating/cooling energy of the office building and greenhouse. 

5.7 Bestcase(BI)scenario
In adding a latent load, and then supplementary lighting load, the energy consumption for heating and  cooling of the full system increased, but the model showed only a difference of 67% overall, suggesting  the change would be small. This is also because the effect is confined mostly to the greenhouse, which is  only part of the system.   When changing the level of above deck insulation between the greenhouse and office building, a  maximum of 2% difference was found in the model (when discounting the instable simulations)  suggesting that the change is essentially insignificant given the margin of error in the accuracy of the  model itself.  The building integrated simulations including a latent load + supplementary lighting and roof insulation  above deck (i.e. no thermal mass in the greenhouse) consistently performed worse than the baseline  standalone greenhouse + office building.  

52   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    In the BI thermal mass simulations, increasing the level of insulation from nothing to RSI 10.6 m2K/W  yielded a small amount of energy savings, which the model indicates is less than 4%. The difference,  however, between the simulations with thermal mass in the greenhouse (insulation below deck) vs.  insulation above deck showed twice that difference ­ a more substantial 7% in the model. The BI  simulations also showed a consistent improvement over the SA systems.  Increasing the resistance of greenhouse glazing showed great improvement to the heating and cooling  requirement of the BI systems; the model suggests that double glazed lowe glass could reduce the  energy requirement of the combined office building and rooftop greenhouse by as much as 30% over  the baseline single glazing. However, there was a negligible difference between the BI and combined SA  scenarios when glazing was improved, although the model indicated in every simulation that the BI  system had performed better. The greenhouse glazing variable showed the largest improvement in the  model, and is therefore the most important change to consider in a greenhouse to save energy on  conditioning.  From these results, it appears from the simulation results that the best performing rooftop greenhouses  (i.e. with the lowest annual energy requirement for heating and cooling in the office building and  greenhouse) will have the highest resistance greenhouse envelope possible and incorporate thermal  mass in the greenhouse. With thermal mass present, the performance continues to improve as the level  of insulation below the concrete roof deck is increased from nothing to RSI 10.6 m2K/W. The  performance improves again when the level of thermal mass is increased. These variables in concert will  almost certainly show an improvement over the equivalent summed SA greenhouse and office building.  Though it requires additional investigation, further improvement might be achieved by developing a  separation with thermal mass facing both the office and the greenhouse, with insulation as an interior  layer.  The only difference to these directives would come if the goal was to improve energy consumption  specifically for the office building; in that case it would be most beneficial to clad the greenhouse in  single lowe glazing, resulting in a lower energy requirement in the office building although the overall  energy use for heating and cooling would be slightly higher than an equivalent situation with improved  glazing. This result is discussed above (see Effect of greenhouse envelope, page 40), and is an important  avenue for further study.      53

6. Conclusions
This research investigates the impact of building integration on the annual heating and cooling energy  requirement of an urban rooftop greenhouse and a typical sixstorey office building. With the correct  parameters, the results indicate positive trends suggesting additional value, beyond local produce, in  providing rooftop greenhouses on urban office buildings.   The simulations adjusting insulation in the greenhouse footprint first increased the conditioning energy  requirement (up to RSI 1.76 m2K/W), then began to decrease as the insulation approached super insulated. The simulation with the lowest total energy requirement for space conditioning in the office  and greenhouse was the one with no insulation separating the structures, most likely because of the  thermal mass exposed to the greenhouse when no insulation was included above the offices' roof deck.  In all cases, the building integrated simulations performed more poorly than the standalone baseline  (the sum of the SA office with RSI 5.28 m2K/W in the roof, and the SA greenhouse with RSI 2.64 m2K/W  underslab insulation).  The addition of thermal mass to the greenhouse, by inverting the roof assembly in the greenhouse  footprint, showed an improvement over previous simulations when insulation instead of concrete was  exposed to the inside of the greenhouse. With thermal mass in the greenhouse, increasing the level of  insulation below the roof deck improved energy consumption in the rooftop greenhouse. Also, all  buildingintegrated simulations showed an improvement over the standalone baseline, indicating that  thermal mass is an important element in equating rooftop greenhouses with their standalone  counterparts.  In changing the greenhouse envelope, a considerable energy savings was found when the glazing was  improved from single pane with no coating, to double pane with a low emissivity coating. The office  portion of the buildingintegrated system was found to perform best when the rooftop greenhouse was  clad in single glazing with a lowe coating, although these simulations still had a higher overall (office +  greenhouse) heating and cool energy consumption than improved envelopes. Additionally, all building integrated simulations, except the baseline single glazing, were found to perform better than the stand alone baselines corresponding to the various greenhouse envelopes.  The simulations wherein a latent load, representing plant transpiration, was added to the greenhouse  result in an increased overall energy requirement in the rooftop greenhouse, likely due to the energy  required to convert the latent load to vapour. While the cooling requirement decreases when the latent  54   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    load is added, the energy required for heating increases much more, suggesting that in a heating  dominated climate, a greenhouse latent load will never be exclusively beneficial. Next, the addition of  supplementary lighting in the greenhouse increases energy consumption again, demonstrating the  effect of using a much less efficient heat source (highpressure sodium lights) to supplement  greenhouse heating.   Therefore, the greatest energy savings for an integrated office building and rooftop greenhouse would  be achieved with the highest resistance envelope possible (which may be limited by the needs of plants  grown in the greenhouse), incorporation of thermal mass in the greenhouse, and a high level of  insulation below the roof deck, in the greenhouse footprint.  

6.1 Limitations
The results of this research show trends indicating which variables may be most important in reducing  the heating and cooling energy consumption of a rooftop greenhouse and office building. Because the  model was not calibrated with an existing building, the results are not indicative of absolute savings, and  require further research to quantify.  Additionally, to conclusively pinpoint the effect of evapotranspiration and HPS lights on the energy  consumption of the system, more detailed models of greenhouse latent and sensible loads must be  generated, and calibrated, for use in the simulation model.  Finally, the thermal mass variable in future studies may be shown to have a different effect on the  greenhouse when furniture and obstructions and/or plant transpiration is incorporated in the  greenhouse. 

6.2 Futurework
Areas of this research that require further study, and similar topics are included below:   Repetition of this research with either a calibrated simulation, or a built rooftop greenhouse.   A specific study of the impact of plants in a rooftop greenhouse on system energy loads. The model  included herein was rudimentary, and did not reflect the dynamic nature of plant transpiration.   Alternative greenhouse envelope improvements, including the use of plastics, which can have better  visible transmittance and better thermal resistance than glass. Glass is especially heavy and may not  always be suitable for rooftop greenhouses. Thermal night curtains should also improve the heating

Changing the characteristics of the separation between the greenhouse and the office building. The  effect of adding additional thermal mass, and its placement in the greenhouse could be important for  further energy savings. A separation with thermal mass to the top and bottom (with insulation as an  interior layer) might be investigated.   Further simulations removing the effects of thermal mass from the buildingintegrated scenario (i.e.  replacing concrete in the separation with an equivalent level of insulation) would provide additional  information to explain the impact of a rooftop greenhouse on the heating and cooling requirement  of the system.   Development of an HVAC system able to actively move heat from the greenhouse to the office  building and vice versa, in order to optimize the indoor environment of both spaces and reduce the  energy requirement for conditioning. The small passive benefits demonstrated in this research could  be massively improved with a system designed to take advantage of the best in both environments.  Additionally, various other symbioses are possible to recycle other forms of waste/exhaust from the  host building, including CO2 cycling (both from combustion heating systems, and from airtight  interior occupied areas) and waste water recycling. There may also be savings possible by combining  the boiler loops of the office building with the greenhouse instead of running two separate HVAC  systems.   Testing how existing office buildings react to the addition of a rooftop greenhouse. In this research,  the HVAC system was sized before every simulation; when the office building has a fixed HVAC  system, how does a rooftop greenhouse impact the heating/cooling requirement, and the interior  environment? This could also create a discussion involving the costs associated with adding a rooftop  greenhouse, and whether they could be offset with energy savings; if not, perhaps offset by the  productive potential of the greenhouse.   Specific comparison of the energy required to produce and transport food into the city, with the  energy it takes to produce food in an urban rooftop greenhouse, and/or other methods of urban  agriculture.   The effect of elevation on the rooftop greenhouse; whether a greenhouse could be effectively  installed on the roof of a two or ten storey building.   Discussion of the potential reduction of urban heat island effect due to rooftop greenhouses.  Conversely, the impact that UHI effect has on the performance of urban rooftop greenhouses.  56   

HEATING AND COOLING REQUIREMENT OF AN OFFICE BUILDING AND URBAN ROOFTOP GREENHOUSE    By providing answers to four research questions ­ regarding evapotranspiration and supplementary  lighting, roof insulation levels, greenhouse envelope composition, and thermal mass ­ this investigation  offers a starting point for future research concerning the operational performance of rooftop  greenhouses, and provides an additional argument for their implementation.
