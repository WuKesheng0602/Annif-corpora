Outsourcing Induced by Strategic Competition
Yutian Chen Pradeep Dubey April 24, 2009
Abstract We show that intermediate goods can be sourced to firms on the "outside" (that do not compete in the final product market), even when there are no economies of scale or cost advantages for these firms. What drives the phenomenon is that "inside" firms, by accepting such orders, incur the disadvantage of becoming Stackelberg followers in the ensuing competition to sell the final product. Thus they have incentive to quote high provider prices to ward off future competitors, driving the latter to source outside.

Introduction

One of the principal concerns of any firm is to configure the supply of intermediate goods essential to its production. Of late, with the liberalization of trade and the lowering of barriers to entry, supply chain configurations have assumed global proportions. Indeed, in several industries, it has become the trend for firms to cut across national boundaries and outsource their supplies "offshore", provided the economic lure is strong enough. Many diverse factors influence firms' decisions. First, of course, there is the immediate cost of procuring the goods which--other things being equal--firms invariably seek to minimize. Then there is the question of risk: a firm may be unwilling to commit itself to a single party and instead spread its orders among others, even if they happen to be costlier, in order to ensure a steady flow of inputs. Sometimes a firm may tie up with a broad spectrum of suppliers so as to increase its access to the latest technological innovation, which could be forthcoming from any one of them. There can arise situations when a firm is impelled to select suppliers that will be strategic allies in its endeavor to penetrate newly emerging markets. For the analysis of these and other factors, and how they impinge on firms' decisions, see, e.g., Jarillo (1993), Spiegel (1993), Vidal and Goetschalkx (1997), Domberger (1998), Aggarwal (2003), Shy and Stenbacka (2003) and Chen et al. (2004). One intriguing possibility that has been alluded to, but not much explored, is that strategic incentives may arise in an oligopoly which outweigh other considerations and play the pivotal role in firms' selection of suppliers. Instances of this are presented by Jarillo and Domberger, of which we recount only two. The first case comes from Germany. AEG1 used to be a traditional supplier to both BMW2 and Mercedes Benz. At some point, with a view to vertical integration, Mercedes Benz acquired AEG. This caused BMW to look for a different supplier, despite the inevitable extra costs of the switch (see p. 67, Jarillo, 1993). The second case involves General Electric (GE) in the United States. In the early 1980's, GE investigated the possibility of outsourcing its lower brand microwave ovens from outside, since these had become too costly to manufacture at its factory in Maryland. Discussions were first held with, and even trial orders given to, Matsushita which happened to be a major rival of GE and also the world leader for this product in terms of both volume and technology. But ultimately GE turned to Samsung, then a small company with little experience in microwaves. The strategy entailed additional costs, such as sending American engineers to Korea, but it worked well for GE (see, pp. 84-86, Jarillo, 1993; and also Case Study 6.2, p. 108, Domberger, 1998). Such case studies clearly point to the need for a game-theoretic analysis. In this paper we bring to light a scenario in which the outsourcing patterns emerge out of the strategic competition between firms. We find that it is typically not the case that a firm will outsource supplies to its rivals. There are two distinct reasons for this. The first is based on increasing returns to scale: if a firm places a sizeable order with its rival, it significantly lowers the rival's costs on account of the increasing returns, and this stands to its detriment in the ensuing competition on the final product. Thus the firm is led to outsource to others who may be costlier but, being out of the final product market, do not pose the threat of future

competition. The second reason is more subtle and persists even in the case of constant returns to scale (i.e., linear costs)--indeed, it comes to the fore in this case. It is the main focus of this paper. To be precise, suppose there are firms N competing in the market for a final product . Intermediate goods  are critical inputs in the production of , but only some of the firms I  N have the competence to manufacture  at reasonable cost. The other firms J  N\I must obtain  from elsewhere. One possibility is to outsource  to their rivals in I. But there is also a fringe of firms O on the "outside" which can manufacture  . What distinguishes O from I is that no firm in O can enter the market for the final product . (This could be because it lacks the technology to convert  to , or else faces high set-up costs--and, possibly, other barriers to entry--in the market .3 ) To keep matters simple, we consider a purely linear model, i.e., in which the costs of production for both  and  are linear; as is the market demand for . Our main result is that, in this scenario, strategic considerations can come into play that will cause the firms in J to outsource  (outside) to O rather than (inside) to I, even if the costs of manufacturing  are higher in O than in I, so long as they are not much higher. The intuition goes roughly as follows and is best seen when I and J consist of single firms and the outside fringe O is a competitive sector whose members simply quote their cost as the price at which they will provide the intermediate good. (Thus O has no strategic role here. However, we show that our results remain intact when O is taken to be strategic, indeed a monopolist,4 though at the cost of a more complicated analysis.) Suppose (i) I and J are Cournot duopolists which compete in the market for the final product ; (ii) I and O can produce the intermediate good , but J cannot; and (iii) O cannot enter the market for . Thus J must decide how to allocate its order of  between I and O, and then how much of it to use in the production of , freely disposing of the unused portion of  . We show that the optimal course of action for J is to outsource exclusively to either I or O, never to both, and to use the entire input to produce . (Thus, in equilibrium, free disposal will not be availed of even though it is permitted.) Now if J outsources to I, then I immediately knows the amount outsourced. This has the effect of establishing J as leader in the Stackelberg game that ensues in the market for , in which I is forced to become the follower. In contrast, if J outsources to O then--thanks to the sanctity of the secrecy clause--I will only know that J has struck a deal with O but not the quantity that J has outsourced. Thus I and J will remain Cournot duopolists in the ensuing game on market . If costs for manufacturing  do not vary too much between I and O, then I will earn less as a Stackelberg follower than as a Cournot duopolist. This will tempt I to push J towards O by quoting so high a price for the intermediate good  that, in spite of the premium that
In particular, think of the following set-up. The market for  is concentrated in the "developed world". The firms in O, on the other hand, are located offshore in the "developing world" and can manufacture  but lack the (advanced) technology for converting  to . Even if some of them were to make the technological breakthrough, they would face not just the standard set-up costs for penetrating the market , but further barriers to entry that pertain to foreign firms. This international setting perhaps makes our hypothesis of an outside fringe O more viable. But we do not need it, and all we formally postulate is the existence of this fringe. 4 The moment O has two or more (identical) firms, Bertrand competition will bring the price they quote down to the level of their cost and O will in effect be a competitive sector. (Note that we postulate linear costs and unbounded capacity). Thus, within the parameters of our model, O can be strategic only if it is a monopolist.

J is willing to pay for the privilege of being the leader, J prefers to go to O. The temptation can only be resisted if it is feasible for I to provide  at such an exorbitant price that it can recoup as provider what it loses as follower. But such an exorbitant price is undercut by the competitive price prevailing at O, as long as O's costs are not too much higher than I's. The upshot is that in any subgame-perfect pure strategy Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the game, J will outsource to O. Throughout our analysis, we confine ourselves to pure strategies. Which subgame gets played between I and J on market --Cournot or Stackelberg--is thus not apriori fixed, but endogenous to equilibrium. This is all the more striking since, in our overall game, the option is open for firm J to outsource to both I and O and to thus bring any "mixture" of the Stackelberg and Cournot games into play. The logic of the SPNE rules out mixing and shows that only one of the two pure games will occur along the equilibrium play. Worthy of note is the fact that it is not J who has the "primary" strategic incentive to outsource to O. This incentive resides with I who is anxious to ward off J and force J to turn to O. The anxiety gets played out when O does not have a severe cost disadvantage compared to J. Otherwise, I is happy to strike a deal with J since it can get high provider prices that compensate it for becoming a follower. That inside firms would want to provide inputs to their competitors at high prices is quite common and has been commented on (e.g., Hart and Tirole, 1990; Ordover et al., 1990; Rey and Tirole, 2006). What is surprising in our scenario is that high prices are quoted not to earn revenue at the expense of the competitor but instead to ward it off and compel it to seek its supply elsewhere. The actual argument is more intricate and the exact result is presented in Section 4. As was said, there are no economies of scale or cost advantages for the outside firm O. In fact, we suppose that O has a higher cost than I for manufacturing  . Our main result states that, if O's cost does not exceed a well-defined threshold, J will outsource to O in any SPNE. Our formal model is as follows. The market for the intermediate good  meets first, followed by duopolistic competition between I and J on the final good . Since the outside competitive fringe O stands ready to supply  at its cost price, firm I must counter this with a price quote of its own for . Then both firms I and J, seeing these prices, decide how much of  to outsource to I and to O. The outsourcing orders are subject to a secrecy clause, which is tantamount to I and J placing their orders simultaneously. The only act that could destroy the simultaneity is a preliminary announcement by I of the quantity of  it intends to produce (outsource to itself). But, in the absence of an external enforcement agency, such an announcement would not constitute a credible commitment and would be like "cheap talk" which can be ignored. We discuss this issue in more detail in Section 6.1. The secrecy clause is crucial for our analysis. It can be upheld on the simple ground that it is routinely seen in practice (see, e.g., Temponi and Lambert, 2001; Ravenhill, 2003; Hoecht and Trott, 2006) and it is often a legally binding provision (see, e.g., Khalfan, 2004; Vagadia, 2007). The evidence supporting the secrecy clause is discussed in Section 6.2. Moreover we give a plausibility argument that, in certain scenarios, it holds endogenously in equilibrium. It must also be pointed out that our model is one-shot (corresponding to discounting the future very heavily if one were to think of a multi-period setting) and in effect all goods are perishable. With a long time horizon, durable goods and players who are patient, other kinds of SPNE would surely emerge. All these considerations--possibility of credible commitments, breakdown of the secrecy clause, long time horizon--are clearly important 4

issues but lie beyond the scope of this paper. Our analysis indicates that firms which position themselves on the "outside", by not entering the market for the final product, are more likely to attract orders for intermediate goods. There is some evidence that this can happen in practice. By the mid-1980's (see Ravenhill, 2003), US companies in the electronics industry were looking "to diversify their sources of supply" in order to fare better against their Japanese competitors. Malaysia and Singapore made a strong bid to get the US business. A key feature of the government policies of both nations was that "they were not attempting to promote national champions in the electronic industry", but the objective was rather "to build a complementary supply base, not to create local rivals that might displace foreign producers". Their success in becoming major supply hubs for electronic components is well documented. Of course it is true that they had the advantage of low-cost skilled labor. But what we wish to underscore is their deliberate and well-publicized abstention from markets for the final products, which by itself gave them a competitive edge. To reiterate this implication of our analysis in more ambitious terms: the current widespread trend of outsourcing to offshore locations may well persist for strategic reasons, even if offshore costs were to rise, so long as the offshore companies abstain from the final product markets of their clients. The paper is organized as follows. We discuss the related literature in Section 2. The model is presented in Section 3, and the main result is described in Section 4. It holds for both scenarios, the one where the outside firm is strategic and the other where it is part of a competitive fringe. An outline of its proof, followed by the formal proof itself (modulo some technical lemmas) are in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss several extensions and variations of the model. Proofs of the technical lemmas are relegated to an Appendix.

Related Literature

Outsourcing of inputs is such an important and widespread phenomenon that it has been studied from various points of view. First, it can be driven by cost considerations or by differences in productivity across firms (see, e.g., Grossman and Helpman, 2002; Antr` as and Helpman, 2004; and the references therein). A second argument is based on niche markets. A firm may be attracted to an exclusive outsourcing contract with a supplier who can provide highly specialized inputs, in order to market a differentiated final product that limits the intensity of price competition (Shaked and Sutton, 1982). There are explanations based on economies of scale. It is cost-effective to outsource inputs instead of undertaking redundant investment of one's own, all the more so if one's rivals have already gone to an outsider and created the scale there (Shy and Stenbacka, 2003). Even when the rival is doing in-house production, there is pressure to outsource because placing orders with the rival will only enhance its economies of scale and lower its costs, making it a more formidable competitor in the final goods market (Chen and Dubey, 2009). Another rationale for outsourcing is based on imperfect competition in the input markets. By outsourcing orders with a supplier to which its rival has already gone, a firm accomplishes two things: first, it raises the input price, which softens the competition in the final goods market and can generate a net gain (Buehler and Haucap, 2006); second, it prevents the rival from extracting monopolistic benefits from the supplier (Arya et al., 2008a). Another line of argument in favor of outsourcing runs as follows. A vertically integrated provider, which competes in the final product market, will 5

have incentive to "hold up" its supply once investments have been sunk in the procurement process (Heavner, 2004). Furthermore there is the considerable risk that the business plans of the input-seeking firm will get revealed to its rival via the orders placed. On both counts, it is safer for the firm to outsource inputs to an outsider. Of course, the other side of the story has also been discussed. If a negotiated agreement can be reached to share the gains, it could become optimal to order inputs from a rival (Spiegel, 1993). Indeed trade of intermediate goods may enable rivals to collude, via contractual agreements based on that trade, and thereby sustain a high price in the downstream market for the final product (Chen 2001; Chen et al., 2004; Arya et al., 2008b). Each of these explanations clearly has its own merit, but our purpose here is to bring a new strategic consideration to the fore which can sometimes be critical to firms' behavior. To this end, we present a stripped-down model in which none of the factors above are present. There are no cost benefits, comparative advantage, niche markets, economies of scale or possibility of collusion; nor is there reluctance in the firm to reveal its business plans to the provider. On the contrary, the strategic competition in our model creates incentive for the input-seeking firm to fully reveal its plans to the vertically integrated rival, with the intent of becoming Stackelberg leader in the final product market. It is the rival who, seeing through this ploy, refuses to play the role of the input provider and drives the firm to outsource elsewhere. There is also considerable literature on endogenous Stackelberg leadership.5 The paper most closely related to ours, and inviting immediate comparison, is Baake et al (1999). They consider a duopoly model to examine what they call "cross-supplies" within an industry--in our parlance, this is the phenomenon that a firm outsources to its rival. The "endogenous Stackelberg effect" is indeed pointed out by them: firm A, upon accepting the order outsourced by its rival B , automatically becomes a Stackelberg follower in the ensuing game on the final markets. But there are set-up costs of production in their model, and provided these costs are high enough, A can charge B a sufficiently high price so as to be compensated for being a follower. The upshot is that cross-supplies can be sustained in SPNE. There are several points of difference between their model and ours. First, their argument relies crucially on the presence of sufficiently strong economies of scale (set-up costs). If these are absent or weak, there is no outsourcing in SPNE in their model. In contrast, in our model, outsourcing occurs purely on account of the endogenous Stackelberg effect (recall that we have constant returns to scale6 ). Second, outsourcing occurs only in some of their SPNE: there always coexist other SPNE where it does not occur. In our model, the outsourcing is invariant across all SPNE. In short, they show that outsourcing can occur, while we show that it must. Third, it is critical for their result that there be no outside suppliers.7 Such suppliers would generate competition that would make it infeasible for A to charge a high price to B , invalidating their result. In our model, the situation is different. We allow for both kinds of suppliers: those that are inside as potential rivals and others that are outside. It turns out that increasing the number of either type leaves our result intact (see Section 6.4). Finally--and this, to our mind, is the most salient difference--the economic phenomena depicted in Baake et al. and here are different, indeed almost complementary. In Baake et
E.g., Hamilton and Slutsky (1990), Robson (1990), Mailath (1993), Pal (1996), van Damme and Hurkens (1999)--in all of which the timing of entry by firms is viewed as strategic. 6 Though outsourcing is further boosted by economies of scale in our model. See Section 6.4. 7 Recall that these are suppliers who are not present as rivals in the final product market.

al., the issue is to figure out when a firm will outsource to its rival. Here we consider precisely the opposite scenario and pinpoint conditions under which a firm will turn away from its rival and outsource instead to an outsider, even if the outsider happens to have a costlier technology. The fact that both models take cognizance of the endogenous Stackelberg effect is a technical--albeit interesting--point. What is significant is that this effect is embedded in disparate models and utilized to explain complementary economic phenomena.

The model

We shall first present Model 1 in which O is a strategic monopolist and then Model 2 where O is a competitive sector. The reason for this order is mathematical brevity: Model 2 can immediately be derived from Model 1 by the simple expedient of setting O's provider price equal to its cost.

Model 1: strategic outside firm
For ease of notation, we substitute 0, 1, 2 for O, I, J. As was said, firms 1 and 2 are duopolists in the market for a final good . An intermediate good  is required to produce . Firm 1 can manufacture  , but 2 cannot. There is an "outside" firm 0 which can also manufacture  . What distinguishes 0 from 1 is that 0 cannot enter the market for the final good . Firm 0's sole means of profit is the manufacture of good  for the "inside" firms 1 and 2. Let x1 and x2 be the respective quantities of  produced by firms 1 and 2, and P (.) be the price of . The inverse market demand for good  is P (x1 + x2 ) = [a - x1 - x2 ]+ where y+  max{y, 0} and a is a positive constant. (1)

The constant marginal cost of production of good  is c0 for 0 and c1 for 1. Furthermore both 1 and 2 can convert one unit of good  into one unit of good  at the (for simplicity) same constant marginal cost, which w.l.o.g we normalize to zero. We assume 0 < c1 < c0 < (a + c1 )/2. (2)

The condition c1 < c0 gives a cost disadvantage to the outside firm 0 and loads the dice against good  being sourced to it. The inequality c0 < (a + c1 )/2 prevents 1 from automatically becoming a monopolist in the market for good . The extensive form game between the three firms is completely specified by the parameters c1 , c0 , a and so we shall denote it (c0 , c1 , a). For i  {0, 1} and j  {1, 2}, let
i qj  quantity of good  outsourced by firm j to firm i and

xj  quantity of good  supplied by firm j. The game (c0 , c1 , a) is played as follows. Stage 1: Firms 0 and 1 simultaneously and publicly announce prices p0 and p1 at which they are ready to provide good  .
1 (quantity of  to order from firm 1 at price p1 ). Stage 2: Firm 2 chooses q2

1 1 Stage 3: For every (p0 , p1 , q2 ), 1 and 2 play the simultaneous-move game G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) where 0 1 1. Firm 1 chooses q1 (quantity of  to order from firm 0 at price p0 ), q1 (quantity of  to produce by itself at cost c1 ) and x1 (quantity of  to put up in the final goods market) subject to: 0 1 1 1 (i) q1 + q1  q2 (the total amount of  is at least q2 so that it is able to honor its 1 0 1 1 commitment to supply q2 units of  to firm 2) and (ii) x1  q1 + q1 - q2 (quantity of  must be producible from the amount of  left on hand after fulfilling the order of firm 2), 1 so that the strategy set of firm 1 in G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) is 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 , q 1 , x 1 )  R3 ) = {(q1 S1 (q2 + |q1 + q1  q2 and x1  q1 + q1 - q2 }.

Note that "" is tantamount to allowing free disposal of the intermediate good (input).8
0 2. Firm 2 chooses q2 (quantity of  to order from firm 0 at price p0 ) and x2 (quantity of  to 0 1 put up in the final goods market) subject to x2  q2 + q2 (quantity of  must be producible 1 from the total  it has ordered). Therefore the strategy set of firm 2 in G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) is 1 0 0 1 S2 (q2 ) = {(q2 , x 2 )  R2 + |x2  q2 + q2 }.

It remains to describe the payoffs of the three firms at the terminal nodes of the game tree. i i=0,1 Any such node is specified by p  (p0 , p1 ), q  {qj }j =1,2 and x  (x1 , x2 ). For i = 0, 1, 2, the payoff i (p, q ) is given by
0 0 0 0 0 (p, q ) = p0 (q1 + q2 ) - c0 (q1 + q2 ),

This completes the description of the game (c0 , c1 , a). 1 Remark (On the Timing of Moves) We have supposed in our game that firm 2 chooses q2 0 in stage 2 after finding out p0 , p1 announced in stage 1; and that subsequently it chooses q2 , x2 1 in stage 3 but without knowing anything further than p0 , p1 , q2 . This is entirely equivalent 1 0 to choosing q2 , q2 , x2 simultaneously in stage 2 after finding out p0 , p1 . 0 1 , q1 , x1 after But for firm 1, the timing we have described is important. Firm 1 chooses q1 1 finding out the order q2 placed by firm 2. This timing is logically necessary. Were firm 1 1 0 1 , it could always renege on its announcement and , q1 , x1 before knowing q2 to announce q1 1 0 1 . Due to the secrecy clause, firm 2 does not even , q1 , x1 after knowing q2 choose a new q1 1 0 it has ordered. As for q1 know if and when firm 1 has gone to 0, leave aside the quantity q1 0 1 and x1 , these are known to firm 1 alone. Thus firm 1 has the full power to revise q1 , q1 , x1 . In the absence of binding contracts, which could be written before a third party such as a 0 1 , q1 , x1 by firm 1 does not courthouse empowered to enforce it, the prior announcement of q1 constitute a credible commitment and has no effect (see Section 6.1).

We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting that we formally incorporate free disposal in our model.

Model 2: competitive outside fringe
For contrast, and to gain better perspective, we shall consider a variant9 Model 2 in which O is a competitive fringe of many outside firms. In this scenario we may take the choice made by a representative firm 0 of O to be p0  c0 (so that 0  0). Thus firm 0 is in effect a "strategic dummy" and we wind up with strategic competition only between firms 1 and 2. We denote this game (c0 , c1 , a). The formal mathematical definition of (c0 , c1 , a) is exactly the same as that of (c0 , c1 , a) except that we take p0  c0 to be an exogenously fixed constant. We seek to find subgame-perfect pure strategy Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of (c0 , c1 , a) and (c0 , c1 , a). Henceforth we shall often denote the games by simply  and .

The main result

Our main result asserts that if the cost disadvantage of the outside firm 0 is not too significant (i.e. c0 - c1 is not too large), then there is outsourcing to 0 in any SPNE of both  and . The Main Result (Strategic outside firm or competitive outside fringe) There is a threshold (c1 )  (c1 , (a + c1 )/2) such that if c0  (c1 , (c1 )), then in any SPNE of either (c0 , c1 , a) or (c0 , c1 , a), firm 2 orders  exclusively from the outside firm 0. Observe that when c0  (c1 , ), firm 0 has a cost disadvantage compared to firm 1, yet 2 outsources  to 0 rather than to 1. Strategic considerations dominate firms' behavior here. To keep these strategic incentives in the foreground, we have assumed in the paper that c0 > c1 .10 The main result is also summarized in Figure 1 below, in which c0 is varied on the horizontal axis, holding a and c1 fixed.

Figure 1: The Main Result This figure confirms our claim that outsourcing to offshore locations will persist for strategic reasons, even if offshore costs rise moderately so long as the offshore companies abstain from the final product markets of their clients.

SPNE of  and : The detailed characterization

In this section we fully characterize SPNE of  (Theorem 1) and  (Theorem 2). The proofs are in Section 5. It will be useful to first state the following lemma.
0 =0 Lemma 1 In any SPNE of (c0 , c1 , a) or (c0 , c1 , a), we must have (i) p0  c1 and (ii) q1 (firm 1 does not outsource to firm 0).

We are grateful to an anonymous referee for suggesting this variant. Below this interval, when c0  c1 , 0 has a cost advantage over 1 and so 2 even more readily outsourced to 0; in fact, for small enough c0 , both 1 and 2 outsource to 0.

Proof See the Appendix. By Lemma 1, in any SPNE play of  or , firm 1's constant marginal cost is c1 . Fix the inverse demand as in (1) and 1's cost at c1 . For constant marginal cost c2  0 of firm 2, let · C(c2 ) be the Cournot duopoly with firms 1 and 2, and · S21 (c2 ) be the Stackelberg duopoly with firm 2 as the leader and firm 1 as the follower.
C Let (xC 1 (c2 ), x2 (c2 )) be the quantities of firms 1 and 2 in the unique NE of C(c2 ) and S S (x1 (c2 ), x2 (c2 )) be the quantities in the unique SPNE of S21 (p1 ). Also define S C S S C xS 1 (c2 ) := max{x1 (c2 ), x1 (0)} and x2 (c2 ) := min{x2 (c2 ), x2 (0)}.

Let (p0 , p1 ) be the pair of prices announced in Stage 1 in an SPNE of  (p0  c0 for ). Denote by G(p0 , p1 ) the game played between firms 1 and 2 following the announcement i i=0,1 0 (p0 , p1 ). Let x  (x1 , x2 ) and q  {qj }j =1,2 . By Lemma 1, q1 = 0 in any SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ). The following definitions will be useful.
C (a) We say that the Cournot outcome is played in G(p0 , p1 ) if (x1 , x2 ) = (xC 1 (p0 ), x2 (p0 )).

As q1 = 0, this property holds for firm 1 if q1 = q2 + x1 . It holds for firm 2 if 0 0 q 1 + q 2 = x2 .

For any interval [u, v ]  [c1 , (a + c1 )/2], define (Graph  )[u, v ]  {(p0 ,  (p0 ))|p0  [u, v ]} and abbreviate Graph   (Graph  )[c1 , (a + c1 )/2]. (Graph  )[u, v ] is portrayed in Figure 2.

(IV) Finally, if c0 = (c1 ), there are two SPNE with the same provider prices (p0 , p1 ) = (c0 ,  (c0 )) . In the first SPNE firm 2 outsources  to 0 and the Cournot outcome is played in G(p0 , p1 ); in the the second SPNE firm 2 outsources  to 1 and the Stackelberg outcome is played. Proof See Section 5. Essentially the same qualitative result can be stated for Model 2 (the game (c1 , c0 , a)), with some obvious modifications spelled out below. First, a little terminology. We say that two SPNE are "equivalent in real terms" if they only differ in the provider prices quoted by the firm to which nothing is outsourced. In other words, the two SPNE must have the i i=0,1 same quantities q  {qj }j =1,2 , and also the same prices except perhaps the provider price pi i i (i = 0, 1) at which there is no outsourced order (i.e., q1 + q2 = 0). Theorem 2 (Competitive outside fringe) There is a threshold (c1 )  (c1 , (a + c1 )/2) (same as in Theorem 1 with the strategic outside firm) such that, in the game (c0 , c1 , a) the following hold. (I) Same as Theorem 1. (II) Same as Theorem 1 except that p1  [ (c0 ), ) and the continuum of SPNE are equivalent in real terms. (III) Same as Theorem 1 except that the continuum of SPNE collapses to a unique SPNE with p1 =  (c0 ).

(IV) Finally, if c0 = (c1 ), there is a continuum of SPNE. In one of these, p1 =  (c0 ) and firm 2 outsources  to firm 1. The rest are indexed by p1  [ (c0 ), ), are equivalent in real terms and have firm 2 outsourcing to firm 0. Proof See Section 5.

Proof of the main results

First we give an intuitive outline of the proof in Section 5.1. The formal proof, modulo some technical lemmas, follows in Section 5.2. The proofs of the lemmas are in the Appendix.

5.1

Outline of the proof

We apply backward induction to determine SPNE of  and . We therefore begin from Stage 1 3 of these games. Here p0 , p1 , q2 are given and firms 1, 2 play the simultaneous-move game 1 G(p0 , p1 , q2 ). It can be viewed as a Cournot game in which firm 2 has built a "capacity" of 1 1 is too small, the game yields the q2 prior to the game. We show that that if the capacity q2 standard Cournot outcome and if it is too large, part of the capacity remains unutilized (thus for any p1 > 0, building a very large capacity cannot be optimal for firm 2). Intermediate capacities have a commitment value and effectively establishes firm 2 as the Stackelberg leader in the final good market  (Lemma S3). Next we move back to Stage 2. Here p0 , p1 are given and firm 2 has to choose its capacity 1 q2 . We show that firm 2's optimal choice is either
1 (i) to order nothing from firm 1 (i.e. q2 = 0) and instead order exclusively from firm 0 to obtain the Cournot profit with cost p0

or (ii) to order nothing from firm 0 and order exclusively the Stackelberg leader output from 1 firm 1 (i.e. build a capacity q2 exactly equal this output). Whether firm 2 prefers to be a Stackelberg leader or a Cournot duopolist depends on the relative values of p0 and p1 . For any p0 , we identify a function  (p0 ) that represents the leadership premium: if p1 <  (p0 ), firm 2 prefers to be the Stackelberg leader and if p1 >  (p0 ) it prefers to be a Cournot duopolist (Lemma S2). Finally we arrive at Stage 1 where firms 0 and 1 simultaneously set prices p0 , p1 for the intermediate good  (for , where firm 0 is part of a competitive fringe, it has no strategic role and p0 automatically equals c0 ). Any p0 , p1 leads to the game G(p0 , p1 ) whose SPNE results in either the Cournot outcome or the Stackelberg outcome. In the Cournot outcome, 2 orders the good  exclusively from firm 0 and then the Cournot game ensues between firms 1 and 2 in the final good market . In the Stackelberg outcome, 2 orders  exclusively from firm 1 and then the Stackelberg game ensues between firms 1 and 2 in the market  with 2 as the leader and 1 the follower. Firm 1's profit in the the market  is clearly lower when it is the Stackelberg follower rather than a Cournot duopolist. Therefore 1 prefers to be the follower only if it can obtain a sufficiently high supplier price of  from firm 2 so that it can recover its losses in the market . However, if firm 0 is not too inefficient compared to 1, 12

it can undercut a high price of  set by 1. We identify a threshold  such that when 0's unit cost c0 is below , any SPNE will entail firm 2 ordering  from firm 0, followed by the Cournot outcome in the market . If c0 > , firm 2 orders  exclusively from firm 1, followed by the Stackelberg outcome in the market  with 2 as the leader and 1 the follower (Lemma S1, which immediately leads to Theorems 1 and 2).

5.2

The formal proof

Fix the inverse demand as in (1) and firm 1's constant marginal cost at c1 . Recall that C(c2 ) is the Cournot duopoly with firms 1 and 2 where 2 has constant marginal cost c2 . For i = 1, 2, denote by i (c2 ) the NE profit of firm i at C(c2 ). Lemma 2 In any SPNE of  or , (i) firm 0 obtains at least zero and (ii) firm 1 obtains at least 1 (c0 ). Proof (i) Follows by noting that firm 0 can always ensure zero payoff by setting a sufficiently high input price (e.g., p0 > a) so that no firm places an order of  with it. (ii) Observe that firm 1 always has the option of setting a sufficiently high input price (e.g., p1 > a) to ensure that 2 does not order  from 1. For any such p1 , 2 orders  only from 0 and the game C(p0 ) is played in the market . If x2 = 0 (i.e. 2 supplies nothing in the market ) in the NE of C(p0 ), then firm 1 obtains the monopoly profit which is higher than 1 (c0 ). If x2 > 0, we must have p0  c0 (otherwise firm 0 will obtain a negative payoff, contradicting (i)) and 1 obtains 1 (p0 )  1 (c0 ). 5.2.1 Stage 3 of  and 

1 Let p0  c1 and p1  0. In Stage 3 of , the simultaneous-move game G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) is played between firms 1 and 2 (p0  c0 for ) where the strategy sets are given by (3) and (4) and 0 the payoffs are given in (6)-(7). From Lemma 1(ii), q1 = 0 (i.e. firm 1 produces  entirely 1 by itself), so by (6), its cost of  is c1 q1 . Optimality requires that 1 1 = x1 + q 2 (every unit of  produced by firm 1 is utilized completely either (i) For firm 1, q1 to supply  or to fulfill the order of  for firm 2). 0 1 1 0 = max{x2 - q2 (ii) For firm 2, q2 , 0}. If x2  q2 then q2 = 0 (if 2's supply of  does not 1 exceed the amount q2 of  that it has ordered from 1, then it does not order  from 0) 1 0 1 1 and if x2 > q2 then q2 = x2 - q 2 (if 2's supply of  exceeds q2 , its order of  from firm 0 equals exactly the additional amount it needs to meet its supply). 1 ) reduces to the game where firms 1 and 2 simultaneously By (i) and (ii) above, G(p0 , p1 , q2 choose x1 , x2  0. By (i) and (6), the payoff function of firm 1 is 1 1 (x1 , x2 ) = P (x1 + x2 )x1 - c1 x1 + (p1 - c1 )q2 .

By (ii) and (7), the payoff function of firm 2 is 2 (x1 , x2 ) =
1 1 ], if x2  [0, q2 P (x1 + x2 )x2 - p1 q2 1 1 . P (x1 + x2 )x2 - p0 x2 - (p1 - p0 )q2 if x2 > q2

1 ) is a Cournot duopoly between firms 1 and 2 where By (9) and (10), G(p0 , p1 , q2

13

(i) firm 1 has constant unit cost c1 ,
1 1 (ii) firm 2's constant unit cost is 0 for x2  [0, q2 ) and p0 for x2 > q2 .

In a Cournot duopoly under inverse demand (1), if firm i has constant marginal cost ci , its unique best response to its rival firm j 's quantity xj is bci (xj ) = [(a - ci - xj )/2]+ . Let C (xC 1 (c2 ), x2 (c2 )) be the quantities of firms 1 and 2 in the unique NE of C(c2 ). We know that
C (xC 1 (p0 ), x2 (p0 )) =

((a - 2c1 + p0 )/3, (a + c1 - 2p0 )/3) if p0 < (a + c1 )/2 ((a - c1 )/2, 0) if p0  (a + c1 )/2 ((a - 2c1 )/3, (a + c1 )/3) if c1 < a/2 (0, a/2) if c1  a/2

(11)

C (xC 1 (0), x2 (0)) =

The following lemma follows from the fact that, under a Cournot duopoly, the best response of a firm is decreasing in its rival's quantity.
1 0 1 1 Lemma S3 (Stage 3) (i) G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) has a unique NE where q1 = 0, q 1 = x1 + q 2 and which is given as follows: 1 C C 0 C 1 (a) If q2  [0, xC 2 (p0 )), then x1 = x1 (p0 ), x2 = x2 (p0 ) and q2 = x2 (p0 ) - q2 ; 1 C c1 1 1 0 (b) If q2  [xC 2 (p0 ), x2 (0)], then x1 = b (q2 ), x2 = q2 and q2 = 0; 1 C C 0 (c) If q2  ( xC 2 (0), ), then x1 = x1 (0), x2 = x2 (0) and q2 = 0. 1 (ii) Suppose p0  (a + c1 )/2. Then the NE of G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) is invariant of p0 . Hence w.l.o.g. we may restrict p0  (a + c1 )/2. Proof See the Appendix.

5.2.2

Stage 2 of  and : The leadership premium

Any node in Stage 2 of  corresponds to a specific price pair (p0 , p1 )  p (for , p0  c0 ) 1 1 where firm 2 chooses q2  0 determining the ensuing game G(p0 , p1 , q2 ). This game can be 1 viewed as a Cournot duopoly between firms 1, 2 in which 2 has built a capacity q2 prior to 1 the game. Lemma S3 above has shown that building a capacity that is too high [q2 > xC 2 (0)] 1 C leads to some part of it being unutilized while a capacity that is too low [q2 < x2 (p0 )] provides no strategic advantage to firm 2. By Lemma S3(i)(b), intermediate capacities 1 C (q2  [xC 2 (p0 ), x2 (0)]) are fully utilized, and moreover firm 2 does not make any additional 1 order of  from firm 0 (i.e. its order is exclusively from firm 1). Thus in this range q2 constitutes a credible commitment that establishes firm 2 as the Stackelberg leader in the 1 ). By (10) and Lemma S3, the payoff of firm 2 at the unique NE (unique) NE of G(p0 , p1 , q2 1 of G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) is  1 1  [0, xC if q2  2 (p0 ) + (p0 - p1 )q2 2 (p0 )), p 1 C 1 1 1 1 c 1 P (b1 (q2 ) + q2 ) q2 - p1 q2 if q2  [xC (13) 2 (q2 ) = 2 (p0 ), x2 (0)],  C 1 1 2 (0) - p1 q2 if q2 > x2 (0).
1  xC For q2 2 (p0 ), firm 2's choice is driven purely by cost considerations (whether p0 > p1 or 1  xC not). On the other hand, for any p1 > 0, choosing q2 2 (0) is not optimal for firm 2.

14

Recall that S21 (p1 ) is the Stackelberg duopoly with firm 2 as the leader with cost p1 and 1 C firm 1 the follower with cost c1 . For q2  [xC 2 (p0 ), x2 (0)], 2 solves the constrained problem of the Stackelberg leader in S21 (p1 ) that is restricted to choose its output in this interval. S 21 Denote by (xS 1 (p1 ), x2 (p1 )) the unique SPNE of S (p1 ) and let (p1 ) and f (p1 ) be the SPNE profits of the leader (firm 2) and the follower (firm 1). It will be useful to define
S C S c1 S C xS xS 2 (p1 ) := min{x2 (p1 ), x2 (0)} and x1 (p1 ) := b 2 (p1 ) = max{x1 (p1 ), x1 (0)}. 1 It is clear that if p1  p0 (i.e. the unit cost of building the capacity q2 is less than the unit cost of the standard Cournot game), then 2 would prefer to be the Stackelberg leader. Since p0  c1 in any SPNE (Lemma 1), if firm 1 sets p1  c1  p0 , then it does not obtain positive profit as a supplier of  and moreover incurs the disadvantage of becoming a Stackelberg follower. The next lemma shows that this cannot be sustained in an SPNE. 1 Lemma 3 In any SPNE of  or  (i) if 0 < p1  p0 , then firm 2 chooses q2 = xS 2 (p1 ) in Stage 2 and consequently (ii) we must have p1 > c1 . Proof See the Appendix. 1 In the light of Lemma 3, consider p1 > c1 > 0. Then by (13), firm 2 will choose q2  xC 2 (0). 21 The SPNE of S (p1 ) for p1 > c1 is given as S xS 1 (p1 ), x2 (p1 ) =

((a - 3c1 + 2p1 )/4, (a + c1 )/2 - p1 ) if c1 < p1  (a + c1 )/2 ((a - c1 )/2, 0) if p1  (a + c1 )/2.

(14)

1 By (14), firm 2's optimal choice of q2 is invariant in p1 for p1  (a + c1 )/2. Henceforth, without loss of generality, we shall consider p1  (a + c1 )/2. Note that S xS 1 (p1 ), x2 (p1 ) = C xC 1 (0), x2 (0) if c1 < a/2 and p1  (a + c1 )/6 S xS 1 (p1 ), x2 (p1 ) otherwise

(15)

1 0 If firm 2 chooses q2 = xS 2 (p1 ) (then q2 = 0 and firm 0 obtains zero payoff), the market  has S the NE xS 1 (p1 ), x2 (p1 ) where firm 2 obtains the Stackelberg leader (possibly constrained) profit 2 (0) - p1 xC 2 (0) if c1 < a/2 and p1  (a + c1 )/6 (p1 ) := (16) (p1 ) otherwise

Firm 1's payoff has two components: (i) the Stackelberg follower's profit and (ii) its supplier revenue (p1 - c1 )xS 2 (p1 ). Hence its payoff is F (p1 ) := 1 (0) + (p1 - c1 )xC 2 (0) if c1 < a/2 and p1  (a + c1 )/6 f (p1 ) + (p1 - c1 )xS 2 (p1 ) otherwise (17)

1 = xS We know by Lemma 3 that if p1  p0 , it is optimal for firm 2 to choose q2 2 (p1 ). Now 1 C 1 =0 consider p1 > p0 . Then by (13), over q2  x2 (p0 ), it is optimal for firm 2 to choose q2 C 0 that yields the Cournot outcome with profits 1 (p0 ) and 2 (p0 ). Firm 0 supplies q2 = x2 (p0 ) to firm 2 at price p0 , so it obtains

(p0 ) = (p0 - c0 )xC 2 (p0 ).

(18)

1 C 1  [xC If 2 chooses q2 2 (p0 ), x2 (p0 )] by paying p1 > p0 for the capacity q2 , it can acquire the leadership (possibly constrained) position in the market . Firm 2 would prefer to be the

15

leader as long as p1 is not too high compared to p0 . Lemma S2 below shows that there is a function  (p0 )  [p0 , (a + c1 )/2] (representing the leadership premium) such that 2 prefers to be the Stackelberg leader as long as p1 <  (p0 ). The detailed description of this function is given in Appendix A1. Let p0 , p1  [c1 , (a + c1 )/2] and G(p0 , p1 ) be the game that follows the announcement 0 1 0 1 1 p  (p0 , p1 ). If (x, q )  (x1 , q1 , q1 ), (x2 , q2 , q2 ) is an SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ), then (i) q2 is an p 1 optimal choice of firm 2 that maximizes 2 (q2 ) given in (13) and (ii) (x1 , x2 ) is the (unique) 1 NE of G(p0 , p1 , q2 ) (Lemma 3). For i = 0, 1, 2 let p i (x, q ) be the payoff of firm i at (x, q ). Lemma S2 (Stage 2) (Leadership premium) There is a continuous and strictly increasing function  : [c1 , (a + c1 )/2]  R+ such that for p0 , p1  [c1 , (a + c1 )/2]
0 1 (i) If (x, q ) is an SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ), then q2 q2 = 0 (firm 2 orders  either exclusively from firm 0 or exclusively from firm 1).

(ii) If p1 <  (p0 ), the Stackelberg outcome is played in the unique SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ) where p 1 1 1 S 0 0 x2 = q 2 = xS 2 (p1 ), x1 = q1 - q2 = x1 (p1 ) and q1 = q2 = 0. The payoffs are 0 (x, q ) = 0, p p 1 (x, q ) = F (p1 ) and 2 (x, q ) = (p1 ). (iii) If p1 >  (p0 ), the Cournot outcome is played in the unique SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ) where p 0 1 C 0 1 x2 = q 2 = xC 2 (p0 ), x1 = q1 = x1 (p0 ) and q1 = q2 = 0. The payoffs are 0 (x, q ) = (p0 ), p p 1 (x, q ) = 1 (p0 ) and 2 (x, q ) = 2 (p0 ). (iv) If p1 =  (p0 ), G(p0 , p1 ) has two SPNE: the Stackelberg outcome is played in one and the Cournot outcome is played in the other. Proof See the Appendix. 5.2.3 Stage 1 of  and 

Now we go to the first stage of  and  where firms 0 and 1 simultaneously announce prices p0 , p1 (p0  c0 for ) that result in the game G(p0 , p1 ). If p1 >  (p0 ) in any SPNE of  or , then the Cournot outcome is played in the induced SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ), firm 0 obtains (p0 ) and firm 1 obtains 1 (p0 ). If p1 <  (p0 ), the Stackelberg outcome is played, 0 obtains zero and 1 obtains F (p1 ). Lemma 4 summarizes some properties of the functions (p0 ) and F (p1 ). Lemma 4 There is 0 (c0 , c1 )  (c0 , (a + c1 )/2) and (c1 )  (c1 , 0 (c1 , c0 )) such that (i) (p0 ) is strictly increasing for p0  [c1 , 0 ), strictly decreasing for p0  (0 , (a + c1 )/2] and its unique maximum is attained at p0 = 0 . (ii) (c0 ) = ((a + c1 )/2) = 0, (p0 ) < 0 for p0  [c1 , c0 ) and (p0 ) > 0 for p0  (c0 , (a + c1 )/2). (iii) F (0 ) > 1 (0 ). (iv) F (p1 ) is strictly increasing for p1  [0, (a + c1 )/2].

(v) For p0  [c1 , 0 ], F ( (p0 ))

1 (p0 )  p0

.

Proof See the Appendix. Part (v) of Lemma 4 asserts that firm 1 prefers the Stackelberg outcome over the Cournot outcome for relatively large values of p0 . To see the intuition for this, observe that both 1 (p0 ) and F ( (p0 )) are strictly increasing in p0 . While p0 has a direct effect on 1 (p0 ), its effect on F ( (p0 )) takes place through the function  (p0 ). The latter causes a stronger effect since  (p0 ) (the leadership premium) itself increases with p0 . As firm 2 is willing pay a higher premium for larger values of p0 , it leads to higher supplier revenue for firm 1. This in turn provides a better compensation to firm 1 for its follower position in the ensuing Stackelberg game. This is the reason why the Stackelberg outcome is preferred by firm 1 for relatively large values of p0 . Lemma S1 (Stage 1) (i) In any SPNE of (c1 , c0 , a): (a) p1 > c1 , (b) p1 =  (p0 ) and (c) p0  [c1 , 0 ]. (ii) In any SPNE of (c1 , c0 , a): (a) p1 > c1 and (b) p1   (c0 ).

(b) the Stackelberg outcome is played if and only if p1 =  (c0 ) and c0  . Proof See the Appendix. 5.2.4 Proofs of Theorems 1 and 2

Proof of Theorem 1 (I)(a) follows from Lemma 1. I(b) and (c) follow from Lemma S2. (II) Observe from Lemma S1(iii) that if c0 < , there is no SPNE where the Stackelberg outcome is played and a continuum of SPNE (indexed by (p0 , p1 ) where p0  [c0 , ] and p1 =  (p0 )) where the Cournot outcome is played. The outsourcing pattern under the Cournot outcome follows from Lemma S2. (III) Again from Lemma S1(iii), if c0 > , there is no SPNE where the Cournot outcome is played and a continuum of SPNE (indexed by (p0 , p1 ) where p0  [c1 , c0 ] and p1 =  (p0 )) where the Stackelberg outcome is played. The outsourcing pattern follows from Lemma S2. (IV) If c0 = , there are two SPNE, one where the Cournot outcome is played and one where the Stackelberg outcome is played, each having p0 = c0 =  and p1 =  (c0 ) (Lemma S1(iii)). The outsourcing pattern again follows from Lemma S2. Proof of Theorem 2 (I) follows from lemmas 1 and S2. (II) Observe from Lemma S1(iv) that if c0 < , there is no SPNE where the Stackelberg outcome is played and a continuum of SPNE, indexed by p1  [ (c0 ), ), where the Cournot 17

outcome is played. The outsourcing pattern under the Cournot outcome follows from Lemma S2. As firm 2 does not order any input from firm 1 in any of these SPNE, they are equivalent in real terms. (III) If c0 > , there is a unique SPNE, where p1 =  (c0 ) and the Stackelberg outcome is played (Lemma S1(iv)). The outsourcing pattern under the Stackelberg outcome follows from Lemma S2. (IV) If c0 = , then there is one SPNE where p1 =  (c0 ) and the Stackelberg outcome is played and a continuum of SPNE, indexed by p1  [ (c0 ), ) and equivalent in real terms, where the Cournot outcome is played (Lemma S1(iv)). The outsourcing pattern again follows from Lemma S2.

Discussion and extensions
Credible commitment versus public announcement

1 When firm 2 orders q2 units of the intermediate good  from firm 1, this constitutes a contract 1 between the two parties, whereby 2 is able to credibly commit itself to the purchase of q2 1 while 1 credibly commits to supply q2 to firm 2. Were one party to renege on its purchase or sale, the other party would have recourse to the signed contract to take it to task. 1 The situation is quite different when firm 1 simply announces that it will produce q1 units for itself. If 1 were to renege, would 1 take itself to task? In the absence of an external enforcement agency (like a courthouse), where 1 could go and write a binding contract to 1 produce q1 or else be liable for severe punishment, 1's announcement is simply that: just "cheap talk" and not a credible commitment. We rule out the possibility of such binding contracts in our model. Thus if we envisage 1 the game where, anxious to be a Stackelberg leader, firm 1 first announces q1 and then firm 1 1 2 comes to it to order q2 , 1 will always be free to change its mind later regarding q1 upon 1 hearing q2 . This fact is common knowledge to all the players. Hence every subgame that follows an announcement by 1, is still (c0 , c1 , a). Since we are looking at Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibria, adding the initial announcements will have no effect and the same equilibria will occur in the subgames as before. Were an external agency in place to enable 1 to make credible commitments,11 our analysis would no longer hold and it may well be possible for 1 to emerge as a Stackelberg leader, with 2 outsourcing to 1. But our model rules out such a mechanism.

It is crucial to our analysis that the quantity outsourced by any firm j = 1, 2 to 0 cannot be observed by the rival firm. This can be justified on the ground that outsourcing contracts in practice do incorporate secrecy (non-disclosure) clauses (see, e.g., Temponi and Lambert, 2001; Ravenhill, 2003; Hoecht and Trott, 2006). In fact, in many cases it is legally binding to have such clauses. Offshore outsourcing contracts are likely to come under the general
11 Since we have linear costs and unbounded capacity, there is no autonomous costly action (such as building up excess capacity ` a la Dixit, 1980) that 1 can undertake to signal its commitment. An external agency is needed for this purpose.

purview of international trade laws that ensure protection of confidential information. For example, Article 39 of the agreement of TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) of The World Trade Organization states:12
"Natural and legal persons shall have the possibility of preventing information lawfully within their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices...so long as such information: (a) is secret in the sense that it is not...generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question; (b) has commercial value because it is secret; and (c) has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret."

Turning more specifically to outsourcing contracts, there is evidence of widespread use of the secrecy clause. For example, in his study of projects outsourced to Kuwait, Khalfan (2004: 61) states that:
"Data confidentiality should be viewed as a critical element by the different parties, and therefore should be respected by the vendor throughout the contracting period and after termination. Taking into consideration that a particular vendor may work simultaneously with two competing organizations, extra caution must therefore be exercised to ensure that data confidentiality is not compromised..."

Discussing data protection laws of the European Union in the context of outsourcing, Vagadia (2007: 121) also points out:
"Each party should recognize that under the agreement it may receive or become appraised of information belonging or relating to the other, including information concerning business and marketing plans...Each party should agree...not to divulge confidential information belonging to the other to any third party..."

The secrecy clause is indeed widely used in practice, which is why we took it be exogenously given in our model. However, it can often be deduced to hold endogenously in equilibrium (in appropriately "enlarged" games). Indeed suppose that the quantity q outsourced by 2 to 0 can be made "public" (and hence observable by 1) or else kept "secret" between 2 and 0. We argue that a public contract can never occur (be active) at an SPNE, as long as the game provides sufficient "strategic freedom" to its various players. For suppose it did occur: 1 knew that 2 buys q units of  from 0 at price p0 . Thus 1 is a Stackelberg follower in the final market , regardless of whom 2 chooses to outsource  to. It would be better for 1 to quote a lower price p0 -  for  . This would be certain to lure 2 to outsource to 1. But p0  c0 , since 0 could not be making losses at the presumed SPNE; hence p0 -  > c1 for small enough  (recall c0 > c1 ). By manoeuvering 2's order to itself, firm 1 thus earns a significant profit on the manufacture of  . It does lose a little on the market for , because 2 has a lower cost p0 -  of  (compared to the p0 earlier), but the loss is of the order of . Thus 1 has made a profitable unilateral deviation, contradicting that we were at an SPNE.

Note that our argument relies on the fact that 1 has the strategic freedom to "counter" the public contract. If, furthermore, 0 also has the freedom to reject the public contract and counter it with a secret contract, then--foreseeing the above deviation by firm 1--firm 0 will only opt for secret contracts. The most simple instance of such an enlarged game is obtained by inserting an initial binary move by 0 at the start of our game . This represents a declaration by 0 as to whether its offer to 2 is by way of a public or a secret contract. The game  follows 0's declaration. It is easy to verify that any SPNE of the enlarged game must have 0 choosing "secret", followed by an SPNE of . Of course, more complicated enlarged games can be thought of. For example, after the simultaneous announcement of p0 and p1 in our game , suppose firm 2 has the option to choose "Public q " or "Secret q " in the event that it goes to 0, followed by "Accept" or "Reject" by 0. Clearly 1 finds out q only if "Public q " and "Accept" are chosen. On the other hand, if 0 chooses "Reject" we (still having to complete the definition of the enlarged game) could suppose that 2's order of  is automatically directed to 1. This game is more complex to analyze, but our argument above still applies and shows that a public contract will never be played out in any SPNE. We thus see that the secrecy clause can often emerge endogenously from strategic considerations, even though--for simplicity--we postulated it in our model. It is apparent that the firm placing orders (firm 2 in our model) may demand secrecy in order to protect sensitive information from leaking out to its rivals and destroying its competitive advantage. Our analysis reveals that the firm taking the orders (i.e., firm 0) may also--for more subtle strategic reasons--have a vested interest in maintaining the secrecy clause.

6.3

Alternative pricing schemes

The pricing scheme we have considered in our model is unit-based, i.e., an input provider charges a constant price for each unit that it supplies. Although other schemes such as flat fees and profit-sharing arrangements are sometimes used in outsourcing, unit-based pricing is the most prevalent (see, e.g., Barth´ elemy, 2003; Robinson and Kalakota, 2004 and Vagadia, 2007). Not surprisingly, many papers (for instance, most of those that we have cited) are based on unit pricing. However, it is important to go beyond this benchmark and investigate alternative pricing schemes and their influence on the pattern of outsourcing. This is an issue that we hope to take up in future work.

6.4

Variations of the model

Our model can be varied in many ways, but the essential theme remains intact: if O's costs are not much higher than I's, J will outsource to O. Here we briefly indicate a few possible variations. 6.4.1 Economies of scale

When there are there are increasing, instead of constant, returns to scale in the manufacture of the intermediate good , a new strategic consideration arises, though it does not affect the tenor of our results. The primary strategic incentive to outsource to the outside firm 0 20

can shift from firm 1 to firm 2. For now 2 must worry that if it outsources  to 1, then 1 will develop a cost advantage on account of economies of scale. In other words, 1 will be able to manufacture  for itself at an average cost that is significantly lower than what it charges to 2. This might outweigh any leadership advantage that 2 obtains by going to 1. So, foreseeing a competitor in 1 that is fierce in spite of being a follower, 2 would prefer to outsource to 0 as long as 0's price is not too much above 1's. This, in turn, will happen if 0's costs are not significantly higher than 1's. But then, if 2 is outsourcing to 0, economies of scale can drive 1 to outsource to 0 as well! These two strategic considerations, the first impelling 1 to push 2 towards 0 and the second impelling 2 to turn away from 1 on its own and to seek out 0, are intermingled in the presence of economies of scale. It is hard to disentangle them and say precisely when one fades out, leaving spotlight on the other. But by eliminating economies of scale altogether, we were able to focus on just the first scenario, wherein the game turns essentially on the informational content of the strategies. Economies of scale can easily be incorporated in our model. Suppose the average cost ci (q ) of manufacturing q units of  falls (as q rises) for both i = 0, 1. For simplicity, suppose ci (q ) falls linearly and that c0 (q ) = c1 (q ) for some positive scalar13 . It can then be shown that there exists a threshold  > 1 such that if  <  : (i) firm 2 outsources to firm 0 in any SPNE, (ii) both firms 1 and 2 outsource to firm 0 in any SPNE when economies of scale are not too small. This result is established in Chen and Dubey (2009).14 6.4.2 Discriminatory pricing

The outsourcing result for increasing returns hinges on the fact that 0 cannot quote discriminatory provider prices to 1 and 2. Otherwise firm 0 can benefit by setting different prices in sequence to 1 and 2 (see, e.g., Arya et al, 2008a). However, in our model with constant returns to scale, discriminatory prices are of no avail. This is so because firm 1's cost c1 is by assumption less than 0's cost c0 . The only reason 1 would contemplate buying from 0, at a price necessarily as high as c0 , is to make public its order and become a Stackelberg leader vis-` a-vis 2. But this is ruled out by the secrecy clause. So 1 will always produce the intermediate good by itself at a lower cost c1 and ignore 0's offer. 6.4.3 Multiple firms of each type

Suppose there are n1 , n2 replicas of firms 1 and 2. The timing of moves is assumed to be as before, with the understanding that all replicas of a firm move simultaneously wherever that firm had moved in the original game. Restricting attention to type-symmetric SPNE, Theorem 1 again remains intact with a lower threshold in terms of the value of (c1 ).
Thus c1 (q ) = max{0, c - bq } and c0 (q ) =  max{0, c - bq } for positive scalars b, c, . It is needed here that the economies of scale be not too pronounced, otherwise pure strategy SPNE may fail to exist. More precisely, for the average cost function c1 (q ) =max{0, c - bq }, it is assumed that 0 < b < c/2a to guarantee (i) the existence of pure strategy SPNE and (ii) in equilibrium, the quantity produced entails positive marginal cost.

6.4.4

Only Outside Suppliers

The strategic incentives that we have analyzed can arise in other contexts. Suppose, for instance, that 1 and 2 both need to outsource the supply of the intermediate good  to outsiders O = {O1 , O2 , . . .}. If 2 goes first to O and 1 knows which Oi has received 2's order, then 1 will have incentive to outsource to some Oj that is distinct from Oi , even if Oj 's costs are higher than Oi 's, so long as they are not much higher. For if 1 went to Oi , it might have to infer the size of 2's orders and thus be obliged to become a Stackelberg follower (e.g., because Oi has limited capacity and can attend to 1's order only after fully servicing the prior order of 2). Alternatively, even if 1 does not know who 2 has outsourced to, or indeed if 2 has outsourced at all, it may be safer for 1 to spread its order among several firms in O so that it minimizes the probability of becoming 2's follower. We leave the precise modeling and analysis of such situations for future research.

Appendix A2
Proof of Lemma 1 (i) For , we have p0  c0 > c1 , so consider  and suppose p0 < c1 . Since c1 < c0 , firm 0 makes (p1 - c0 ) < 0 dollars per unit of the total outsourced order 0 0 0 0 q1 + q2 that it receives. If it could be shown that q1 + q2 > 0, there would be an immediate contradiction, because firm 0 can in fact ensure zero payoff by deviating from p0 to some sufficiently high p0 (e.g., p0 > a), at which price neither firm will outsource anything to it. 0 0 To complete the proof, we now show that q1 + q2 > 0. 1 0 > 0. Then, since p0 < c1 , Let q2 = 0 (otherwise we are done). If x2 > 0, we must have q2 0 1 will pass on this order to 0, i.e., q1 > 0. 0 1 If x2 = 0, then, as is easily verified, x1 > 0, i.e., q1 + q1 > 0. But the cost of producing 0 1 0 1 1 0 q1 + q1 is p0 q1 + c1 q1 . Since p0 < c1 , optimality requires that q1 = 0, so q1 > 0. 0 (ii) It is clear by (6) that if p0 > c1 , then firm 1 will choose q1 = 0. If p0 = c1 < c0 and 0 q1 > 0, then firm 0 obtains a negative payoff. As it can ensure a zero payoff by quoting a 0 sufficiently high price, we must have q1 = 0. To prove Lemma S3, we first prove Lemma A1. 1 Lemma A1 The following hold for G(p0 , p1 , q2 ). (i) The unique best response of firm 1 to x2  0 is bc1 (x2 ). The unique best response of 1 1 1 firm 2 to x1  0 is (a) bp0 (x1 ) if q2 < bp0 (x1 ), (b) b0 (x1 ) if q2 > b0 (x1 ) and (c) q2 if p0 1 0 b (x1 )  q2  b (x1 ). 1 (ii) If (x1 , x2 ) is an NE, then (a) x1 = bc1 (x2 ), (b) x2 = bp0 (x1 ) if x2 > q2 , (c) x2 = b0 (x1 ) if 1 p0 0 1 x2 < q2 and (d) b (x1 )  x2  b (x1 ) if x2 = q2 . 1 1 1 C (iii) (a) If q2  xC 2 (p0 ), there is no NE where x2 < q2 and (b) if q2  x2 (0), there is no NE 1 where x2 > q2 .

1 1 m(x1 ) := min{b0 (x1 ), q2 } and M (x1 ) := max{bp0 (x1 ), q2 }.

1 By (10), for x1  0, the unique optimal strategy of firm 2 over x2  [0, q2 ] is m(x1 ) while 1 p0 0 1 1 over x2  [q2 , ), it is M (x1 ). As b (x1 )  b (x1 ) and x2 = q2 is feasible for both [0, q2 ] and 1 [q2 , ), (a)-(c) follow by (27).

The unique solution to this system is x1 = xC 1 (p0 ) and x2 = x2 (p0 ) < x2 (0)  q2 , 1 contradicting x2 > q2 . C C 1 < xC Proof of Lemma S3 (i)(a) Let 0  q2 2 (p0 ). First we show that (x1 (p0 ), x2 (p0 )) is p0 C xC an NE. Clearly xC 1 (p0 ) = 1 (p0 ) is the unique best response of firm 1 to x2 (p0 ). Since b C C 1 C x2 (p0 ) > q2 , x2 (p0 ) is the unique best response of firm 2 to x1 (p0 ).

To prove the uniqueness, note by Lemma A1 (iii)(a) that if (x1 , x2 ) is an NE, we must 1 have x2  q2 . 1 1 1 If (x1 , q2 ) is an NE, then by Lemma A1(ii)(a) and (d), x1 = bc1 (q2 ) and q2  bp0 (x1 ) = 1 1 bp0 (bc1 (q2 )) . Since x2 xC bp0 (bc1 (x2 )) , we have q2  xC 2 (p0 )  x2 2 (p0 ), a contradiction. 1 Hence if (x1 , x2 ) is an NE, then x2 > q2 and by A1 (ii)(a)-(b), x1 = bc1 (x2 ) and x2 = C bp0 (x1 ). The unique solution of this system has x1 = xC 1 (p0 ) and x2 = x2 (p0 ), completing the proof.
1 C (i)(b) Let xC xC bc2 (bc1 (x2 )) , 2 (p0 )  q2  x2 (0). Since for c2  {0, p0 }, x2 2 (c2 )  x2 1 1 1 1 1 we have bp0 (bc1 (q2 ))  q2  b0 (bc1 (q2 )) and by A1(i) it follows that (bc1 (q2 ), q2 ) is an NE. The uniqueness follows from A1(ii)(a)-(d) by noting that for this case there is no NE where 1 . x2 = q 2 C C C 1 > xC (i) (c) Let q2 2 (0). First we show that (x1 (0), x2 (0)) is an NE. Clearly x1 (0) is the C 0 C C 1 unique best response of firm 1 to x2 (0). Since b x1 (0) = x2 (0) < q2 , by (i)(b), xC 2 (0) is C the unique best response of firm 2 to x1 (0). To prove the uniqueness, note by A1(iii)(b) that if (x1 , x2 ) is an NE, we must have 1 x2  q 2 . 1 1 1 1 )) .  b0 (x1 ) = b0 (bc1 (q2 ) is an NE, then by A1(ii)(a) and (d), x1 = bc1 (q2 ) and q2 If (x1 , q2 C 0 c1 1 C Since x2 x2 (0)  x2 b (b (x2 )) , we have q2  x2 (0), a contradiction. 1 Hence if (x1 , x2 ) is an NE, then x2 < q2 and by A1(ii)(a) and (c), x1 = bc1 (x2 ) and 0 C x2 = b (x1 ). The unique solution of this system has x1 = xC 1 (0) and x1 = x2 (0), completing the proof. 0 1 0 (ii) If p0  (a + c1 )/2 > c1 , then q1 = 0 and in the NE of G(p0 , p1 , q2 ), q2 > 0 only if 1 C C 0 0 q2  [0, x2 (p0 )) [part(i)]. Since x2 (p0 ) = 0 for p0  (a + c1 )/2 [by (11)], we have q1 + q2 =0 for p0  (a + c1 )/2, yielding zero payoff for firm 0. This proves (ii). 1 Proof of Lemma 3 (i) Observe by (13) that firm 2 chooses q2  xC 2 (0) for any p1 > 0. By lemmas 1 and S3, p0  [c1 , (a + c1 )/2]. If p0 = (a + c1 )/2, then xC 2 (p0 ) = 0 and the S C result is immediate. So let p0 < (a + c1 )/2. Then x2 (p1 ) > x2 (p0 ) > 0 for p1  p0 . As 1 1 C C 1 S the unconstrained maximum of p 2 (q2 ) over q2  [x2 (p0 ), x2 (0)] is attained at q2 = x2 (p1 ), p S p C 1 S the constrained maximizer is q2 = x2 (p1 ) and 2 (x2 (p1 )) > 2 (x2 (p0 )). Noting that for p 1 1 q2  xC 2 (p0 )), 2 (q2 ) is either increasing (if p1 < p0 ) or constant (if p1 = p0 ), it follows that 1 the unique global optimal choice for firm 2 in Stage 2 is q2 = xS 2 (p1 ). (ii) If p1  c1 , then firm 1 does not obtain any positive profit as a supplier of  . We will show now that if p1  c1 , firm 1's profit in the final good market  is less than 1 (c0 ). Then the result will follow from Lemma 2. By Lemma 1, p0  c1 . If 0 < p1  c1  p0 , then by (i), it is optimal for firm 2 to choose C S 1 = xS q2 2 (p1 ) = min{x2 (p1 ), x2 (0)}. If p1 = 0, then by (13), it is optimal to choose either C 1 1 = xS q2 2 (p1 ) or any q2  x2 (0). S 1 If q2 = x2 (p1 ), 2 will supply x2 = xS 2 (p1 ) in the market  (Lemma S3) and 1's profit there C 1  xC would be f (p1 ) < 1 (p1 ) < 1 (p0 )  1 (c0 ). If q2 2 (0), then 2 will supply x2 = x2 (0) (Lemma S3) and firm 1's profit from the market  would be 1 (0) < 1 (c0 ). Proof of Lemma S2 First we prove (ii)-(iv). Part (i) follow immediately from (ii)-(iv). 1 1 0 . Denote + q2 = 0 and x1 = q1 To prove (ii)-(iv), note that in any SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ), q1  C C C A1 (p) = [0, x2 (p0 )] and A2 (p) = [x2 (p0 ), x2 (0)]. Let At (p) be the set of all maximizers of

24

1 1 1 1 2 (q2 ) over q2  At (p) and let A (p) be the set of all 2 (q2 ) over q2  0. We know that    for p0 , p1  [c1 , (a + c1 )/2], A  A1  A2 . We prove (ii) by showing that A (p) = {0} if  S p1 <  (p0 ), A (p) = {xS 2 (p1 )} if p1 >  (p0 ) and A (p) = {0, x2 (p1 )} if p1 =  (p0 ). By Lemma 3, A (p) = {xS 2 (p1 )} if p1  p0 . So consider p1 > p0 . Then we know that  A1 = {0}. Let g (p0 ) := (2/3)p0 + (1/3)(a + c1 )/2. If p0 = (a + c1 )/2, then xC 2 (p0 ) = 0 and   S A = A2 , so that A = A2 = {x2 (p1 )}. Since g (p0 ) =  (p0 ) = (a + c1 )/2 for p0 = (a + c1 )/2, the proof for this case is complete. Now let p0 < (a + c1 )/2, so that g (p0 ) > p0 . For p1  g (p0 ), we C  C C  C have xS / A 2 (p1 )  x2 (p0 ). Hence A2 = {x2 (p0 )}. Thus, x2 (p0 )  A2  A1 but x2 (p0 )  1 = {0}.   Hence A = A1 = {0}.  S  S Finally let p1  (p0 , g (p0 )). Then A 1 = {0} and A2 = {x2 (p1 )}. Hence A  {0, x2 (p1 )}. p S 2 Note that p 2 (0) = 2 (p0 ) = (a + c1 - 2p0 ) /9 and 2 (x2 (p1 )) = (p1 ). By (14), (15) and (16) we have

(p1 ) =

(p1 ) = (a + c1 )2 /9 - p1 (a + c1 )/3 if c1 < a/2 and p1  (a + c1 )/6, (p1 ) = (a + c1 - 2p1 )2 /8 otherwise.

(28)

Comparing 2 (p0 ) = (a + c1 - 2p0 )2 /9 with (p1 ) and (p1 ) we have the following where 1 , 2 are given in (19). (p1 ) 2 (p0 )  p1 1 (p0 ) and (p1 ) 2 (p0 )  p1 2 (p0 ) (29)

There are following possible cases, where (c1 ) is given by (20). Case 1(a) If c1 < a/2 and p0  (a + c1 )/6 > (c1 ), then by (21),  (p0 ) = 2 (p0 ). Since p1 > p0 , under this case we have p1 > (a + c1 )/6. 1(b) If c1  a/2, then by (20), (c1 ) < c1  p0 and again  (p0 ) = 2 (p0 ). Observe by (28) that if either (a) or (b) holds, then (p1 ) = (p1 ). Hence by (29), (p1 ) 2 (p0 )  p1 2 (p0 ) =  (p0 ) proving the result for Case 1. Case 2 c1 < a/2 and p0 < (a + c1 )/6: 2(a) If p0  (c1 ), then  (p0 ) = 1 (p0 )  (a + c1 )/6 and 2 (p0 )  (a + c1 )/6 [by (21)]. (i) If p1  (p0 , (a + c1 )/6], then by (28), (p1 ) = (p1 ). Hence by (29), (p1 ) p1 1 (p0 ) =  (p0 ). 2 (p0 ) 

(ii) If p1  ((a + c1 )/6, g (p0 )], then by (28), (p1 ) = (p1 ). Hence by (29), (p1 ) < 2 (p0 ) for p1 > (a + c1 )/6  2 (p0 ). The result for Case 2(a) follows by (i) and (ii) above. 2(b) If p0  ((c1 ), (a + c1 )/6), then  (p0 ) = 2 (p0 ) > (a + c1 )/6 and 1 (p0 ) > (a + c1 )/6 [by (21)]. (i) If p1  (p0 , (a + c1 )/6], then by (28), (p1 ) = (p1 ). Hence by (29), (p1 ) > 2 (p0 ) for p1  (a + c1 )/6 < 1 (p0 ). (ii) If p1  ((a + c1 )/6, g (p0 )), then by (28), (p1 ) = (p1 ). Hence by (29), (p1 ) p1 2 (p0 ) =  (p0 ). The result for Case 2(b) follows by (i) and (ii) above. Proof of Lemma 4 Parts (i)-(ii) follow from (18) by noting that xC 2 (p0 ) = (a + c1 - 2p0 )/3 for p0  [c1 , (a + c1 )/2]. 25 2 (p0 ) 

(iii) Noting that 0 > (a + c1 )/6, by (17), we have F (p1 ) = f (p1 ) + (p1 - c1 )xS 1 (p1 ). As 2 c1 < c0 < 0 < (a+ c1 )/2, by (14), F (0 ) = (3a +2c0 - 5c1 ) /64+(a +2c0 - 3c1 )(a + c1 - 2c0 )/16. As 1 (0 ) = (5a + 2c0 - 7c1 )2 /144, we have F (0 ) - 1 (0 ) = (17a + 62c0 - 79c1 )(a + c1 - 2c0 )/576 > 0 since a > c0 > c1 . This proves (iii). (iv) Follows by standard computations by using (14) and (17). (v) First let p0  (c1 ). Then by (21),  (p0 ) = 2 (p0 )  (a + c1 )/6. Hence by (14) and (17), F ( (p0 )) = (a - 3c1 + 2 (p0 ))2 /16 + ( (p0 ) - c1 )[(a + c1 )/2 -  (p0 )]. Comparing it with 1 (p0 ) = (a - 2c1 + p0 )2 /9, we have the following where 2 (c1 ) is given by (23). For p0  (c1 ), 1 (p0 ) Next observe that for p0 < (c1 ), (c1 ) c1  c1  a where   1/(3 + 2 2)  (0, 1/2) and  > . (31) F ( (p0 ))  p0 2 (c1 ) (30)

Case 1 c1  a: Then by (31), [c1 , (a + c1 )/2)  [(c1 ), (a + c1 )/2). As  < , for this case (c1 ) = 2 (c1 ) [by (25)] and the result follows by (30). Case 2 c1 < a: Then by (31), [c1 , (a + c1 )/2) = [c1 , (c1 ))  [(c1 ), (a + c1 )/2). If p0  [c1 , (c1 )], then by (21),  (p0 ) = 1 (p0 ) < (a + c1 )/6. Since c1 < a < a/2, by (12) and (17), F ( (p0 )) = (a - 2c1 )2 /9 + ( (p0 ) - c1 )(a + c1 )/3. Comparing it with 1 (p0 ) = (a - 2c1 + p0 )2 /9, we have 1 (p0 ) F ( (p0 ))  w(p0 ) 0 where w(p0 ) := 5p2 0 - 2(a + 4c1 )p0 + 3c1 (a + c1 ). (32)

Noting that (i) w(p0 ) is strictly decreasing for p0  [c1 , (c1 )], (ii) w(c1 ) > 0 and (iii) w((c1 )) 0  c1 a, we have the following two subcases. Subcase 2(a) c1  [a, a): Then for all p0  [c1 , (c1 )), w(p0 ) > 0 and hence by (32), 1 (p0 ) > F ( (p0 )). Since for this case (c1 ) = 2 (c1 )  (c1 ) [(23) and (26)], the result follows by (30). ¯(c1 ) [by (24)]. Hence by (30), 1 (p0 ) < F ( (p0 )) for Subcase 2(b) c1 < a: Then 2 (c1 ) <  p0  [(c1 ), (a + c1 )/2). For p0  [c1 , (c1 )), w(c1 ) > 0 > w((c1 )) and  1 (c1 )  (c1 , (c1 )) [given by (23)] such that 1 (p0 ) F ( (p0 ))  p0 1 (c1 ). Noting that (c1 ) = 1 (c1 ) for this case [by (25)], the proof is complete. Proof of Lemma S1 (i)(a) Follows from Lemma 3. (i)(b) If p1 <  (p0 ), then firm 1 obtains F (p1 ). As F is monotonic (Lemma 4), 1 can deviate to p1  (p1 ,  (p0 )) to obtain F (p1 ) > F (p1 ). So we must have p1   (p0 ). If p1 >  (p0 ), firm 0 obtains (p0 ). If p0 is marginally higher or lower than p0 , we will have p1 >  (p0 ) and 0 would obtain (p0 ) by deviating to p0 . As  is strictly increasing for p0  [c1 , 0 ) and strictly decreasing for p0  [c1 , 0 ) (Lemma 4), there are gainful deviations for 0 if p0 = 0 . Now let p0 = 0 and p1 >  (0 ). Then firm 1 obtains 1 (0 ). By deviating to p1 = 0 <  (0 ), firm 1 would obtain F (0 ) > 1 (0 ) (Lemma 4). This completes the proof of (b). (i)(c) If the claim is false, then p0  (0 , (a + c1 )/2]. Since p1 =  (p0 ) [by (i)(b)], firm 0 obtains either 0 (the Cournot outcome) or (p0 ) (the Stackelberg outcome). Let 0 deviate 26

to p0 = 0 < p0 so that  (0 ) <  (p0 ) = p1 . Then 0 would obtain (0 ) which is positive and more than (p0 ) (Lemma 4), proving the result. (ii) Part (a) follows by (i)(a) and part (b) follows from the first paragraph of the proof of (i)(b) by taking p0  c0 . (iii)(a) The "if" part: Let p1 =  (p0 ), p0  [c0 , 0 ] and p0  . Then the Cournot outcome is played in an SPNE of G(p0 , p1 ), where 0 obtains (p0 )  0 (since p0  c0 ) and 1 obtains 1 (p0 ). We prove the result by showing that neither 0 nor 1 has a gainful unilateral deviation. Clearly a deviation to p0 < c0 is not gainful for firm 0. If it deviates to p0 > p0 , then  (p0 ) >  (p0 ) = p1 and it would obtain 0  (p0 ). If it deviates to p0  [c0 , p0 ), then  (p0 ) <  (p0 ) = p1 and it would obtain (p0 ) < (p0 ) (by Lemma 4, since p0   < 0 ). Now consider firm 1. If it deviates to p1 > p1 =  (p0 ), 1 would still obtain 1 (p0 ). If it deviates to p1 < p1 =  (p0 ), 1 would obtain F (p1 ) < F ( (p0 )) (by the monotonicity of F ). Since F ( (p0 ))  1 (p0 ) for p0   (Lemma 4), we have F (p1 ) < 1 (p0 ). This completes the proof of the "if" part. The "only if" part: By (i), p1 =  (p0 ) and p0  [c1 , 0 ] in any SPNE. Under the Cournot outcome, firm 0 obtains (p0 ) and firm 1 obtains 1 (p0 ). If p0 < c0 , then (p0 ) < 0. As 0 can deviate to p0 = (a + c1 )/2 to obtain zero payoff, if the Cournot outcome is played in an SPNE of , we must have p0  c0 . By deviating to p1 > p1 =  (p0 ), firm 1 obtains F (p1 ) which can be made arbitrarily close to F ( (p0 )) by choosing p1 close to p1 . To ensure that firm 1's deviation is not gainful for any p1  (0, p1 ), we need 1 (p0 )  F ( (p0 )), so by Lemma 4 we must have p0  . (iii)(b) The "if" part: Let p1 =  (p0 ), p0  [c1 , c0 ] and p0  . Then the Stackelberg outcome is played in an SPNE of the game G(p0 , p1 ), where 0 obtains zero payoff and 1 obtains F (p1 ). We prove the result by showing that neither 0 nor 1 has a gainful unilateral deviation. If 0 deviates to p0 > p0 , then p1 =  (p0 ) <  (p0 ) and it would still obtain zero payoff. If it deviates to p0 < p0  c0 , then it would obtain at most zero and such a deviation is also not gainful. Now consider firm 1. If it deviates to p1 > p1 =  (p0 ), it would obtain 1 (p0 )  F (p1 ) (by Lemma 4, since p0  ). If firm 1 deviates to p1  [0, c1 ), it would obtain less than 1 (c1 ) (see the proof of Lemma 3(ii)) which is at most 1 (p0 )  F (p1 ). Finally if it deviates to p1  [c1 , p1 ), it would obtain F (p1 ) and by the monotonicity of F , such a deviation is also not gainful. The "only if" part: By (i), p1 =  (p0 ) and p0  [c1 , 0 ] in any SPNE. Under the Stackelberg outcome, firm 0 obtains zero and firm 1 obtains F (p1 ) = F ( (p0 )). If p0 > c0 , let firm 0 deviate to p0  (c0 , p0 ). Then p1 =  (p0 ) >  (p0 ) and it would obtain (p0 ) > 0, so we must have p0  c0 . If firm 1 deviates to p1 > p1 =  (p0 ), it would obtain 1 (p0 ). To ensure that this deviation is not gainful, we need F ( (p0 ))  1 (p0 ), so by Lemma 4 we must have p0  . (iv) As firm 0 does not play any strategic role in , we only check for unilateral deviations of firm 1. Then the results follow from part (iii) by taking p0  c0 .
