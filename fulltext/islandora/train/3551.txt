ABSTRACT 
 

Investigation of Creep and Fatigue in High Temperature Polymer Matrix  Composites Using a Micromechanical Approach 
Doctor of Philosophy, 2014  Alireza Sayyidmousavi  Mechanical and Industrial Engineering  Ryerson University  Polymer  matrix  composites  (PMC's)  are  widely  used  in  critical  aerospace  structures  due  to  their  numerous  advantageous  mechanical  properties.  Recently,  PMC's  have  been  considered  for  high  temperature  applications  where  viscoelasticity  arising  from  the  time  dependent  nature  of  the  polymer  matrix  becomes  an  important  consideration.  This  inherent  viscoelasticity  can  significantly  influence  deformation,  strength  and  failure  response  of  these  materials  under  different  loading  modes  and  environmental  factors.  With  a  potentially  large  number  of  plies  of  different  fiber  directions  and  perhaps material properties, determining a fatigue failure criterion of any degree of generality through  experiments only, may seem to be an  unrealistic task. This difficult situation  may be  mitigated through  the  development  of  suitable  theoretical  micro  or  macro  mechanical  models  that  are  founded  on  considering  the  fatigue  failure  of  the  constituting  laminas.  The  microapproach  provides  a  detailed  examination  of  the  individual  failure  modes  in  each  of  the  constituent  materials  i.e.  fiber,  matrix.  In  this  work,  a  micromechanical  approach  is  used  to  study  the  role  of  viscoelasticity  on  the  fatigue  behavior of polymer matrix composites. In particular, the study examines the interaction of fatigue and  creep  in  polymer  matrix  composites.  The  matrix  phase  is  modeled  as  a  vicoelastic  material  using  Schapery's  single  integral  constitutive  equation.  Taking  viscoelsticity  into  account  allows  the  study  of  creep  strain  evolution  during  the  fatigue  loading.  The  fatigue  failure  criterion  is  expressed  in  terms  of 

iii   

the  fatigue  failure  functions  of  the  constituent  materials.  The  micromechanical  model  is  also  used  to  calculate  these  fatigue  failure  functions  from  the  knowledge  of  the  SN  diagrams  of  the  composite  material  in  longitudinal,  transverse  and  shear  loadings  thus  eliminating  the  need  for  any  further  experimentation.  Unlike  the  previous  works,  the  present  study  can  distinguish  between  the  strain  evolution due to fatigue and creep. The results can clearly show the contribution made by the effect of  viscoelasticity  to  the  total  strain  evolution  during  the  fatigue  life  of  the  specimen.  Although  the  effect  of  viscoelsticity  is  found  to  increase  with  temperature,  its  contribution  to  strain  development  during  fatigue is compromised by the shorter life of the specimen when compared to lower temperatures.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Motivation 

High  strengthtoweight  ratios  of  composites  compared  to  metallic  materials  has  won  them  numerous  applications  in  different  industries.  In  particular,  polymer  matrix  composites  (PMC's)  are  being  widely  used  in  the  aerospace  industry.  As  an  example,  modern  commercial  aircrafts  such  as  the  Airbus  380  and  Boeing  787  have  utilized  composite  materials  for  their  structural  load  bearing  components.  For  instance,  the  Boeing  787  has  a  gross  weight  comprised of 50% composite resulting in an aircraft which is 80% volume in composite. Figure  1.1 shows an overview of the usage of composite materials in Boeing 787 commercial aircraft.  One apparent advantage of using composite materials in an aircraft structure is decreasing the  weight which will result in the reduction of fuel consumption.

One  important  feature  expected  of  polymer  matrix  composites  in  today's  applications  especially  in  advanced  aerospace  systems,  is  to  sustain  high  temperatures  and  mechanical  loadings  while  maintaining  their  light  weight  and  flexibility.  These  applications  usually  involve  long  term  exposure  of  the  composite  material  to  high  temperatures  such  as  in  the  propulsion  systems and other engine components of commercial and military aircrafts. Examples of these  applications  include  structural  and  nonstructural  parts  on  or  around  the  aeroengines  and  airframe  components  of  supersonic  and  hypersonic  aircrafts  and  space  vehicles,  insulation  for  flexible  cables  to  use  as  a  high  temperature  adhesive  in  the  semiconductor  industry  and  high  temperature  composite  membranes  for  polymer  electrolyte  fuel  cells.  A  great  deal  of  attention  has  recently  been  focused  on  the  use  of  composite  materials  in  areas  where  the  temperatures could be in the range of 100 to 400o C.   One  suitable  candidate  to  be  used  for  such  applications  are  fiber  reinforced  polymer  matrix  composites  (PMC's).  It  (Montesano  et  al.,  2011)  is  mainly  due  to  their  unique  combination  of  hightemperature stability, good chemical and solvent resistance as well as excellent retention  of  mechanical  properties  at  elevated  temperatures.  However,  the  integration  of  PMC's  into  such  applications  is  still  not  so  widespread.  As  a  result,  high  temperature  polymer  matrix  composites have recently been the subject of numerous research studies.   Unlike  metals  in  which  damage  starts  in  the  form  of  micro  cracks  at  loci  of  high  stress  concentration,  there  are  different  damage  mechanisms  in  composite  materials  which  may  initiate  throughout  the  structure  without  any  explicit  stress  concentrations(Montesano  et  al.,  2011). The existence of two or more distinct constituent phases in composite materials causes 

2   

them  to  experience  different  forms  of  damage  mechanisms  which  include  matrix  cracking,  fiber  fracture,  fibermatrix  interface  debonding  and  delamination  between  adjacent  plies  (Jen  and  Lee,  1998b).  Due  to  the  potentially  large  number  of  plies  of  different  fiber  orientations  and  perhaps  material  properties,  determining  a  failure  criterion  of  any  degree  of  generality  through  experiments  only,  may  seem  to  be  an  unrealistic  task.  On  the  other  hand,  in  polymer  matrix  composites,  the  resin  matrix  material  has  moduli  and  strength  properties  which  are  viscoelastic  or  time  dependent.  This  time  dependent  effect  is  further  augmented  by  high  temperature  which  accelerates  damage  progression  and  material  property  degradation.  The  viscoelastic  behavior  of  the  polymeric  matrices  of  composite  materials  can  significantly  influence  their  deformation,  strength  and  failure  response  under  different  loading  conditions.  Due to the hereditary effect of viscoelastic materials, the response to an applied load depends  not  only  on  the  present  state  of  loading  but  also  on  the  previous  states.  In  fact,  one  of  the  most  important  concerns  arising  in  the  use  of  polymers  as  the  matrix  component  of  fiber  reinforced  composites  is  the  hereditary  (viscoelastic)  nature  of  the  molecular  structure  of  the  particular polymer being used.   Applications  of  polymer  matrix  composites  (PMC)  in  automotive  and  aerospace  industries,  bridge  structures,  water  and  waste  systems  and  offshore  explorations  and  oil  productions,  require  a  service  life  of  10  to  50  years  (Guedes,  2007).  On  the  other  hand,  performing  experiments on the material or structure for such long periods is not economically feasible. An  additional  issue  in  the  case  of  high  temperature  PMC's  is  that  long  term  creep  and  fatigue  testing  at  elevated  temperatures  usually  limits the  use  of  conventional  testing  equipment  and  techniques.  In  fact,  there  is  an  ever  increasing  demand  for  the  development  of  suitable 
3   

theoretical  models  for  accelerated  life  characterization  of  PMC  materials.  Therefore  development  of  a  predictive  model  to  study  the  response  of  high  temperature  PMC's  to  both  static  and  dynamic  loading,  in  particular  the  contribution  of  the  time  dependent  effect  of  the  matrix material to the failure of the composite system, poses a serious challenge.

Research Objectives  

The  main  objective  of  the  present  thesis  is  to  investigate  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the  creep  and  fatigue  behavior  of  polymer  matrix  composites  through  a  simplified  micromechanical  approach.  In  particular,  the  role  of  viscoelasticity  on  the  fatigue  behavior  of  polymer  matrix  composites  at  room  and  high  temperatures  needs  to  investigated.  In  fact,  regarding  the  limitations  of  conducting  experiments  at  high  temperatures,  the  present  work  aims  to  present  a  theoretical  substitute  which  is  validated  through  comparison  with  the  existing  experimental  data  in  the  literature  as  well  as  the  experiments  conducted  by  the  author.  To this end, the following tasks have been carried out:    Programming a Simplified Unit Cell Micromechanical model in MATLAB.  Studying  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the  elastic  and  viscoelastic  responses  of  PMR15  based  composite  systems  at  high  temperatures  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  thermorheologically complex material.   Introducing a micromechanical approach to predict the creep failure of polymer matrix  composite materials at high temperatures.   Proposing a methodology to Investigate the role of viscoelasticity on the fatigue failure  of polymer composite materials at room and high temperatures.

 Thesis Outline 

Chapter  2  presents  a  literature  review  of  the  creep  and  fatigue  behavior  of  fiber  reinforced  polymer matrix composites including the effect of high temperature. Chapter 3 introduces the  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  model  and  its  formulation.  In  chapter  4  the  thermo mechanical  viscoelastic  response  of  a  high  temperature  polymer  matrix  composite  system  made  up  of  T65035  graphite  fibers  embedded  in  PMR15  resin  is  studied  through  the  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  (SUCM)  model.  Chapter  5  introduces  a  micromechanical  approach  to  study  the  time  dependent  failure  of  unidirectional  polymer  matrix  composites.  The  composite  material  investigated  is  T300/934  which  is  suitable  for  service  at  high  temperatures  in  aerospace  applications.  In  chapter  6,  the  micromechanical  model  is  modified  to  study  the  role  of  viscoelasticity  on  the  fatigue  behavior  of  polymer  matrix  composites  E Glass/Epoxy  and  Graphite/Epoxy  at  room  and  high  temperatures.  Chapter  7  contains  a  case study  on  the  viscoelasticity  of  the  advanced  high  temperature  RP46  polyimide  resin  based  composite  system.

High Temperature Polymer Matrix Composites 

High  temperature  polymer  matrix  composites  have  recently  been  the  focus  of  numerous  research  studies.  In  the  1970's  and  1980's,  NASA  developed  two  types  of  polymers  as  candidates  for  use  in  high  temperature  composite  materials.  These  two  types  are  known  as  linear  polyimides  and  addition  aromatic  polyimides  (St.  Clair  and  St.  Clair,  1981).  The  main  advantages  of  linear  polyimides  are their  high  damage  tolerability  and  thermal  stability  over a  wide  range  of  temperatures.  On  the  other  hand,  the  addition  aromatic  polyimides  are  more  brittle and possess higher temperature stability compared to the first group due to their cross linked  molecular  structure  (Meador,  1987).  However,  because  of  containing  health  hazardous  byproducts,  these  polymers  were  never  largely  produced  and  used  for  high  temperature  polymer matrix composites.   The first group of polymers widely produced by NASA for use in high temperature PMC's were  developed  using  the  polymerization  of  monomer  reactants  (PMR)  approach  (Serafini  and  Vannucci,  1975).  These  polyimides  were  found  to  have  excellent  thermal  stability,  ease  of  manufacturability  and  ability  to  withstand  temperatures  more  than  300o  C.  The  main  derivative  of  this  kind  of  polyimide  resins  is  PMR15  with  extensive  applications  in  the  aerospace industry. The maximum useful long term operating temperature of PMR15 is about  260o  C  for  jet  engine  applications.  Two  other  high  temperature  polyimide  resins  developed  by  NASA  are  AMB21  (Tiano  et  al.,  2000)  and  DMBZ15  (Xie  et  al.,  2001).  These  thermoset  polyimides  have  the  same  properties  as  PMR15  but  without  any  hazardous  byproducts.  In 

6   

fact, DMBZ15 has a higher wear resistance compared to PMR15 and is suitable for long term  exposures to temperatures more than 300o C.   Another  example  of  high  temperature  polyimide  resins  is Avimid  K3B which  is  a  thermoplastic  material  used  for  supersonic  transport  aircrafts  with  an  operating  temperature  of  approximately  180o  C  (Sacks  and  Johnson,  1998).  Other  thermoset  and  thermoplastic  polyimide  resins  considered  for  PMC  matrix  material  for  supersonic  aircraft  applications  include  R116,  PETI5  and  PIXA  (Shimokawa  et  al.,  2008).  In  an  effort  to  develop  polyimides  with  higher  service  temperatures,  NASA  created  RP46  as  a  superior  replacement  for  the  existing  polyimide  resin  systems.  Its  ability  to  resist  extreme  operating  temperatures  (up  to  375o  C)  makes  it  an  ideal  material  for  many  critical  aerospace  applications  that  have  little  tolerance for failure.   Most  recently,  a  thermoset  polyimide  called  HFPEII52  was  developed  at  NASA  Glenn  Research  Center  for  use  in  high  temperature  composite  materials  (Bhargava,  2007).The  maximum  operating  temperature  for  this  polyimide  is  reported  to  be  315o  C.  Although  polyimide  based  polymer  matrix  composites  (PiMC's)  have  many  other  improved  properties  compared  to  other  PMC's,  they  are  mainly  used  for  applications  where  high  specific  strength,  high  specific  stiffness  and  high  temperature  resistance  are  required.  Examples  of  such  applications  are  space  launch  propulsion  systems,  rocket  engine  components  and  advanced  turbine  engine  applications  (Thesken  et  al.,  2004).  More  specifically,  for  instance,  PMR15  based  composites  are  used  in  engine  ducts  for GE  F404  engines,  firewall  in  GE  F90  engine  and  various splitters and fairings in F110 engines.  

7   

Thanks  to  their  light  weight  and  corrosion  resistance,  PiMC's  have  also  attracted  a  lot  of  applications  in  maritime  structures  such  as  displacement  vessels,  ships  with  single  skin  structures  as  well  as  in  offshore  including  fire  protection  panels,  water  piping  systems,  partition  walls,  tanks  and  vessels  (Meador,  1995).  One  important  potential  application  of  PMC's in general and high temperature PiMC's in particular, is the next generation jet engines  currently  under  research  in  Pratt  and  Whitney  and  General  Electric.  These  engines  require  greater  durability  and  less  weight  for  better  operation  while  maintaining  structural  integrity  (Bhargava,  2007).  Polyimide's  ability  to  from  organometallic  compounds  with  metals  enables  PiMC's  to  be  used  in  high  temperature  applications  which  require  them  to  be  adhered  to  metal  surfaces.  In  fact,  PiMC's  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion  can  be  adjusted  so  as  to  fit  that of metal to minimize residual stresses during processing.

Literature Review on the Creep Behavior of Fiber Reinforced Polymer  Composites 
Time dependent behavior of polymer matrix composite materials 

In  polymer  matrix  composites,  the  resin  matrix  material  has  moduli  and  strength  properties  which  are  viscoelastic  or  time  dependent.  This  time  dependent  effect  is  especially  important  at  elevated  temperatures  which  accelerate  damage  progression  and  material  property  degradation.  Due  to  the  hereditary  effect  of  viscoelastic  materials,  the  response  to  an  applied  load  depends  not  only  on  the  present  state  of  loading  but  also  on  the  previous  states.  In  fact,  one of the most important concerns arising in the use of polymers as the matrix component of  fiber reinforced composites is the hereditary (viscoelastic) nature of the molecular structure of  the  particular  polymer  being  used.  The  objective  of  this  section  is  to  review  the  literature  on 

8   

the  creep  behavior  and  creep  failure  of  PMC's.  The  creep  behavior  of  PMC's  has  been  extensively  investigated  both  experimentally  and  analytically.  However,  due  to  the  immense  number  of  works  on  the  subject  and  since  the  focus  of  the  present  thesis  is  on  a  micromechanical  approach,  we  only  review  some  of  the  most  popular  and  frequently  cited  theoretical models. 
2.2.1.1 Findley's power law 

Findley's  power  law  model  (Findley  et  al.,  1976)  is  known  to  be  of  the  most  frequently  used  analytical  models  investigating  the  viscoelastic  behavior  of  different  composite  materials.  The  general form of the power law equation is: 

   tt n  (t )   0  
Where  (t): total time dependent strain  '0: stressdependent and temperaturedependent initial elastic strain  't: stressdependent and temperaturedependent coefficient  n: stressindependent coefficient  t: time after loading 

(2.1)

There  is  also  another  form  of  Findley's  equation  which  is  expressed  in  terms  of  creep  compliance as follows: 

D(t ) 

 (t )  D0  Dt t n   

(2.2)

Where 
9   

D(t)= total time dependent creep compliance  = the applied stress  D0= instantaneous creep compliance  Dt= transient creep compliance  The  effect  of  temperature  of  the  viscoeastic  response  has  been  included  in  Findley's  power  law model by Yen and Morris (1989) in the following form: 

 ( ,T , t )   [D0 ( ,T )  Dt ( ,T )t n ]  
2.2.1.2 Boltzmann's superposition principle 

(2.3)

According  to  Boltzmann's  principle  the  sum  of  the  timedependent  strain  outputs  resulting  from  each  component  of  stress  input  is  the  same  as  the  strain  output  resulting  from  the  combined stress inputs (Scott et al., 1995). This principle is expressed as:  

 (t )  J 0   J (t   )
0

t

d ( ) d d  

(2.4)

Where   J0: timeindependent component of creep compliance   J(t): timedependent component of the creep compliance  The  abovementioned  components  are  independent  of  stress  which  therefore  makes  this  principle inapplicable to nonlinear viscoelastic materials. 
2.2.1.3 Schapery single integral model 

 Schapery's  single  integral  model  is  based  on  the  principles  of  irreversible  thermodynamics.  The Schapery integral for the uniaxial state of stress is expressed by Schapery (1969): 
10   

 (t )  g 0 D0  g1  Dt (  )
0

t

d ( g 2 ) d d  

(2.5)

 is the reduced time which is given by: 

 

dt  0 a 
t

(2.6)

 



 
a
 

0

g0,  g1,  g2  and  a  are  called  the  nonlinear  material  parameters  which  are  mainly  stress  and  temperature  dependent.  For  a  linear  viscoelastic  material,  these  parameters  are  equal  to  unity.  It  should  be  noted  that  for  the  case  of  linear  viscoelastic  materials,  the  aboveintegral  relation  will  be  reduced  to  Boltzmann's  superposition  principle.  Under  a  constant  stress,  the  Schapery equation takes the following form (Lou and Schapery, 1971): 

 (t )  g0 D0  g1Dt (

t ) g2   a

(2.7)

Where Dt is expressed in terms of Findley's power law: 

Dt  kt n  

(2.8)

D0  and  Dt  can  be  determined  from  creep  tests  under  low  stresses  i.e.  when  the  material  is  in  the  linear  viscoleastic  domain.  The  nonlinear  coefficients  g0,  g1,  g2  and  a  are  calculated  from  creep  and  recovery  data  at  different  levels  of  stress.  Another  way  to  deal  with  Schapery's  equation is through a recursive scheme which will be explained in detail in chapter 3. The main  advantage  of  this  scheme  is  its  ability  to  capture  the  hereditary  effect  in  viscoelastic  materials 

11   

meaning  that  the  response  to  an  applied  load  depends  not  only  on  the  present  state  of  loading but also on the previous states 
2.2.2 Creep failure of polymer matrix composites 

The  viscoelastic  behavior  of  the  polymeric  matrices  of  composite  materials  can  significantly  influence  their  deformation,  strength  and  failure  response  under  different  loading  conditions.  Due to the hereditary effect of viscoelastic materials, the response to an applied load depends  not  only  on  the  present  state  of  loading  but  also  on  the  previous  states.  In  fact,  one  of  the  most  important  concerns  arising  in  the  use  of  polymers  as  the  matrix  component  of  fiber  reinforced  composites  is  the  hereditary  (viscoelastic)  nature  of  the  molecular  structure  of  the  particular  polymer  being  used.  Applications  of  polymer  matrix  composites  (PMC)  in  automotive  and  aerospace  industries,  bridge  structures,  water  and  waste  systems  and  offshore  explorations  and  oil  productions,  require  a  service  life  of  10  to  50  years  (Guedes,  2007).  On  the  other  hand,  performing  experiments  on  the  material  or  structure  for  such  long  periods  is  not  economically  feasible.  An  additional  problem  in  the  case  of  high  temperature  PMC's  is  that  long  term  creep  testing  at  elevated  temperatures  usually  limits  the  use  of  conventional testing equipment and techniques. Therefore there is an ever increasing demand  for  the  development  of  suitable  theoretical  models  for  accelerated  life  characterization  of  PMC  materials.  A  great  amount  of  research  has  been  carried  out  on  the  development  of  time  dependent  failure  criteria  to  predict  the  lifetime  of  polymers  and  polymer  matrix  composite  materials.  What  follows  is  an  introduction  to  some  of  the  existing  theoretical  approaches  to  predict the life time of polymer matrix composites. 

12   

2.2.2.1

Kinetic rate theory approach to creep failure 

This  approach  is  based  on  the  kinetics  of  molecular  flow  and  rupture  of  the  atomic  structure.  Using  this  approach  and  upon  conducting  experiments  on  more  than  50  different  materials  including  both  metals  and  polymers,  Zhurkov  (1984)  proposed  the  following  equation  for  the  time to creep rupture in a uniaxial tensile test:   

  

Dt  t0 exp(

(U 0   ) ) kT  

(2.9)

The  parameter  t0  is  defined  as  the  natural  oscillation  period  of  the atomic  structure which  is  a  constant  for  all  the  materials.  k  and  T  denote  Boltzman  constant  and  absolute  temperature,  respectively.  U0  is  the  activation  energy  which  should  be  overcome  in  order  to  rupture  the  atomic  structure  of  the material.    is  a  constant  which  depends  on  the previous  treatments  of  the material and varies over a wide range for different materials. 
2.2.2.2 Fracture mechanics approach 

Several  authors  have  done  a  lot  of  work  extending  the  principles  of  fracture  mechanics  to  viscoelastic  material  in  order  to  predict  the  time  dependent  growth  of  cracks.  Knauss  (1970)   proposed  a  nonlinear  first  order  differential  equation  to  describe  the  growth  of  a  crack  in  a  large  viscoelastic  plate  subject  to  a  constant  stress  far  from  the  position  of  the  crack.  The  differential  equation  contained  the  creep  compliance  and  the  surface  energy  of  the  material.    Schapery  (1975a,1975b,1975c)  developed  a  theory  to  predict  the  time  of  fracture  initiation  and  crack  tip  velocity  in  linear  viscoelastic  materials  which  he  applied  to  an  elastomer  under  simple  and  biaxial  stress  states.  Christensen(1981)  developed  a  formula  for  estimating  the  lifetime  of  polymers  and  polymer  matrix  composites  under  steady  load.  The  necessary  input 
13   

parameters  for  this  model  are  the  viscoelastic  creep  function  of  the  material,  energy  of  the  crackgenerated  surface  layer  and  a  characteristic  failure  dimension  of  the  body.  The  method  was  applied  to  aramidcomposite  material  strands  and  was  found  to  be  agreeable  with  experimental  results.  In  a  more  recent  study,  Christensen  (2002)  used  a  kinetic  crack  growth  theory  developed  for  polymers  to  evaluate  linear  cumulative  damage.  The  life  time  was  defined  as  the  time  needed  for  an  initial  crack  to  grow  large  enough  to  cause  instantaneous  further  propagation.  The  formulation  applies  only  to  central  crack  problems  with  quasistatic  crack growth in polymeric materials in glassy elastic states. 
2.2.2.3 The time dependent yielding model 

According  to  this  model  developed  by  Nagdi  and  Murch  (1963),  the  total  strain  is  the  sum  of  plastic and viscoelasic strains and a yield function f is defined as follows: 

f ( ij ,  p ij , ij , kij )  0

(2.10)  

Where  ij  is  the  stress  tensor,  pij  is  the  plastic  strain  tensor,  and  kij  is  a  tensor  representing  strain hardening. In order to account for viscoelasticity in the yield function, a time dependent  factor  ij  was  introduced.  Later,  Crochet  (1966)  gave  a  specific  form  to  this  time  dependent  factor:  

  [( V ij   E ij )( V ij   E ij )]0.5  
and defined a time dependent uniaxial yield function as 

(2.11)

 y  A  B{exp(C )}

 

(2.12)

with  A,  B  and  C  as  material  constants.  This  approach  was  used  by  Crochet  to  perform  a  stress  analysis on a viscoelastic/plastic internally pressurized hollow cylinder in a state of plain strain. 

14   

2.2.2.4

Energy based creep failure criteria 

This  approach  is  based  on  the  concept  of  the  energy  stored  in  the  viscoelastic  subject  to  loading.  However,  the  concept  of  distortional  energy  as  a  failure  criterion  for  an  elastic  material  cannot  be  readily  extended  to  viscoelastic  material  because  in  addition  to  energy  storage,  viscoelastic  deformation  involves  energy  dissipation  which  should  as  well,  be  taken  into account. The ReinerWeissenberg (RW) theory is probably one of the earliest approaches  to  predicting  creepfailure  of  viscoelastic  materials.  According  to  this  approach,  when  a  viscoelastic  material  is  loaded  (e.g.  in  creep),  it  both  stores  and  dissipates  energy.  Therefore,  the  total  deformation  energy  at  any  time  is  the  sum  of  the  free  (stored)  energy  and  the  dissipative  energy.  The  RW  theory  suggests  that  the  deviatric  free  (stored)  energy  is  responsible  for  failure  (Reiner  and  Weissenberg,  1939).  Hiel  (1983)  has  utilized  a  generalized  VoigtKelvin  model  and  the  concept  of  free  energy  from  the  RW  theory  to  describe  a  one  dimensional  delayed  (time  dependent)  failure  criterion  for  polymer  matrix  composites.  According  to  Brinson  (1999),  Bruller  has  demonstrated  that  if  the  Poisson  ratio  is  assumed  to  be  constant,  the  deviatric  portion  of  the  stored  energy  comprises  93%  of  the  total  deformation  energy  in  a  uniaxial  tension  test.  In  addition,  since  many  polymers  are  very  sensitive  to  bulk  properties,  Brinson  (1999)  reasons  that  the  total  stored  energy  could  be  a  better  indicator  of  failure.  According  to  Hiel  (1983),  the  stored  energy  in  the  springs,  the  dissipated  energy  in  the  dampers  and  the  total  energy  of  the  generalized  VoigtKelvin  model  representing a viscoelastic material under creep load are given by 

Wsprings   2 0 {

D0 N Di t   (1  exp( ))2} 2 i1 2 i

(2.14)

 

Wtotal   2 0 {

D0 N t   Di (1  exp( ))}  i 2 i 1

(2.15)

Based  on  the  RW  theory,  there  is  a  limit  to  the  energy  stored  in  the  material  which  is  a  constant  and  therefore  regarded  as  a  material  property.  If  in  Equation  2.14,  time  approaches  zero  and  the  applied  stress  is  replaced  with  the  static  rupture  stress  i.e.  0=R,  then  the  maximum allowed free energy is calculated as: 

Wmax   2 R

D0   2

(2.16)

So that the RW failure criterion can therefore be expressed as follows [30]:

Literature Review on the Fatigue of Fiber Reinforced Polymer  Composites 

2.3.1

Fatigue damage modeling of fiber reinforced composite materials  

Today,  due  to  their  light  weight  and  high  strength  as  compared  to  metallic  alloys,  composite  materials  are  frequently  used  in  different  industries.  However,  understanding  the  nature  of  cyclic or fatigue loading for the prediction of lifetime of fiber reinforced composite materials is  of paramount importance. While there is enormous literature on the fatigue failure of metallic  materials,  modeling  fatigue  damage  in  composite  materials  has  not  yet  been  as  thoroughly 
16   

investigated.  The  existence  of  two  or  more  distinct  constituent  phases  in  composite  materials  causes  them  to  experience  different  forms  of  damage  mechanisms  which  include  matrix  cracking,  fiber  fracture,  fibermatrix  interface  debonding  and  delamination  between  adjacent  plies.  As  a  result,  there  are  some  major  differences  between  the  fatigue  of  metals  and  fiber  reinforced  composites.  Fatigue  micro  cracks  in  metallic  components  initiate  at  high  stress  concentration  locations  which  gradually  coalesce  to  form  a  large  crack  which  will  eventually  lead to the failure of the component. However, except towards the very end of the fatigue life,  no  significant  reduction  of  stiffness  can  be  observed.  On  the  other  hand,  in  fiber  reinforced  composites,  damage  with  significant  loss  of  stiffness  starts  at  a  very  early  stage  (Degrieck  and  Van  Paepegem,  2001).  Some  of  the  most  serious  difficulties  to  be  overcome  in  the  fatigue  life  prediction of composite materials have been reported as follows:    Different growing damage mechanisms for different stress levels (Barnard et al., 1985).  Loading  sequence  is  important  i.e.  highlow  and  lowhigh  load  sequences  can  result  in  considerably different damage growths (Hwang and Han, 1986a).   The  socalled  cyclemix  effect  which  means  that  for  the  same  total  number  of  cycles,  composites  that  experience  small  cycle  blocks  have  a  shorter  average  fatigue  lives  compared to laminates that are subjected to large cycle blocks (Farrow, 1989).   The  impact  of  frequency  on  the  fatigue  life,  in  particular  for  matrix  dominated  loading  conditions,  which  is  due  to  the  general  sensitivity  of  the  matrix  to  the  loading  rate  (Ellyin and ElKadi, 1990).   The  effect  of  viscoelasticity  of  the  polymer  matrix  contributes  to  the  evolution  of  damage in the composite material. 
17   

A  workable  classification  of  fatigue  life  prediction  models  for  fiber  reinforced  polymer  composites  is  based  on  the  fatigue  criteria  proposed  by  Sendeckyj  (1990).  According  to  this  classification,  fatigue  models  can  generally  fall  into  three  categories:  The  fatigue  life  models,  residual stiffness/strength phenomenological models, and the progressive damage models. 
2.3.1.1 Fatigue life models  

The  fatigue  life  models  are  based  on  the  information  obtained  from  SN  curves  or  Goodman  diagram and introduce a failure criterion to determine the fatigue life of the specimen. One of  the first models falling into this category was proposed by Hashin and Rotem (1973): 

 A   uA    T    1  u      T  u    
2 2

(2.18)

Where  A  ,  T  and    denote,  axial,  transverse  and  shear  stresses,  respectively.  The  superscript  u indicates the ultimate stress. According to this model, the material is assumed to have failed  upon  the  failure  of  one  the  constituents.  A  modified  version  of  the  aforementioned  fatigue  model  was  developed  by  Reifsnider  and  Gao  (1991)  in  which  the  failure  criteria  for  matrix  dominated  and  fiberdominated  failure  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the  average  stresses  fij  and  mij in the matrix and fiber constituents, respectively. The failure functions for this model are: 

 f 11  X f
  m 22    m12    Xm     m   1    S   
2 2

(2.19)

18   

Xf is the fatigue failure functions of the fiber. Xm and Sm denote the fatigue failure functions of  the  unreinforced  matrix  material,  respectively.  These  failure  functions  are  functions  of  Stress  ratio, frequency, number of cycles and temperature.   In  another  model  proposed  by  Ellyin  and  ElKadi  (1990),  the  fatigue  failure  criterion  was  expressed in terms the strain energy density through a power law type relation of the form: 

Wt  kN  f  

(2.20)

Where the fatigue life Nf is related to the total energy input Wt. k and  are functions of fiber  orientation  angle.  The  strain  energy  was  calculated  based  on  the  assumption  of  elastic  plane  stress.   Fawaz  and  Ellyin  (1994)  developed  a  semilog  linear  relationship  between  the  applied  cyclic  stress S and the number of cycles to failure N: 

S  m log(N )  b Sr  mr log(N )  br  

(2.21)

The  subscript  r  refers  to  a  chosen  reference  line.  The  relation  between  the  two  sets  of  material parameters (m,b) and (mr,br) is expressed through functions f and g as follows: 

m  f (a1 , a2 , ).g ( R ).mr b  f (a1 , a2 , ).br
 

(2.22)

R denotes the stress ration and  is the fiber orientation angle. a1 and a2 are defined as: 

19   

y x  a2  xy x  
a1 

(2.23)

The major drawback of this model is its sensitivity to the choice of the reference (Degrieck and  Van Paepegem, 2001).   Jen and Lee (1998a,1998b) proposed a generalized multiaxial TsaiHill fatigue failure criterion 

  xx    xx  2   xx  2   xx         M  M M M M 12  22  11 22          1  11   22   11   12   
2 11

(2.24)

In  this  model,  all  inplane  stresses  are  expressed  in  terms  xx,  through  stress  transformations  between  the  global  and  local  axes  coordinate  systems,  the  stress  ratios  Rxx,  Ryy  and  Rxy  as  well  as  the  ratios    and    between  xx  and  yy  and  xx  and  xy,  respectively,  the  fatigue  strengths 

 ii   are  functions  of  frequency,  stress  ratio  which  need  to  be  determined  experimentally.  A 
semiempirical  fatigue  life  prediction  model  was  developed  by  Bond  (1999)  for  variable  amplitude  loading  of  glass  fiber  reinforced  composites  in  which  the  SN  curve  was  described  as: 

 max  b. log( N )  c  

(2.25)

Where  b  and  c  are  4th  order  polynomial  functions  of  the  stress  ratio  R.  Another  empirical  fatigue model was proposed by Epaarachchi and Clausen (2000): 
  ult  1       1  (1  R) f   ( N  1)  max   

(2.26)

20   

Where  f  is  the  frequency,    is  a  constant  fixed  to  1.6.  Parameters    and    are  determined  experimentally.  None  of  the  models  falling  into  the  category  of  fatigue  life  models  have  directly  taken  the  effect  of  viscoelasticity  and  temperatures  into  account  which  is  of  primary  importance in the case of polymer matrix composites. 
2.3.1.2 Residual stiffness/strength models 

This  class  of  models  is  based  on  the  stiffness  or  strength  degradation  during  the  fatigue  loading  in  which  the  growth  of  a  damage  variable  D  is  expressed  in  terms  of  macroscopically  observable properties. One very popular expression for the damage variable D is 
D  1 E E0  

(2.27)

 

Where E0 is the modulus of the virgin (undamaged) material.  Hwang  and  Han  (1986b)  introduced  the  concept  of  fatigue  modulus  F  which  is  defined  as  the  slope  of  the  applied  stress  and  the  resultant  strain  at  a  specific  cycle.  Based  on  this  concept,  they  proposed  three  different  damage  models.  However,  the  third  model  proved  to  be  in  better agreement with experimental data. The damage variable in this model is defined as: 

D

 r  F0  1  1  r  F (n)   

(2.28)

Failure  takes  place  when  D  equals  unity  and  r  is  the  ratio  of  the  applied  cyclic  stress  to  the  ultimate static stress.  Yang  et  al  (1990)  developed  a  residual  stiffness  model  for  fiberdominated  composites  as  follows: 

21   

dE(n)  E (0)Qvnv1 dn  

 (2.29) 

Q  and  v  are  two  parameters  which  correlated  by  a  linear  equation.  According  to  experimental  data,  v  may  be  expressed  in  the  form  of  a  linear  function  of  the  applied  stress.  It  was  later  observed  that  this  model  cannot  be  readily  applied  to  matrix  dominated  composites.  This  led  to  a  modified  version  of  this  model  in  which  E  was  replaced  with  the  fatigue  modulus  F.  Broendsted  et  al.  (1997a,1997b)  developed  a  stiffness  reduction  model  for  the  fatigue  life  prediction  of  glass  fiber  reinforced  composites  based  on  the  experimental  observations  of  wind turbine materials under cyclic loadings. According to this model:  

E d n  E    1   K.  E     dN  0

(2.30)

Where  E  is  the  cyclic  modulus  after  N  cycles,  E1  is  the  initial  cyclic  modulus  and  E0  is  the  static  modulus.  denotes the maximum stress and K is a constant. Whitworth has developed several  phenomenological  models  based  on  stiffness  degradation,  the  most  comprehensive  of  which  (Whitworth, 1997) expresses the growth of degradation as follows: 

dE* (n) a  m1 dn (n  1) E* (n)  





(2.31)

E*(N) =E(n)/E(N) is the ratio of the residual stiffness i.e. after n cycles to the failure stiffness. a  and  m  are  parameters  which  depend  on  the  applied  stress,  loading  frequency,  and 

22   

temperature  and  other  environmental  factors.  Kawai  (1999)  introduced  a  model  for  the  off axis fatigue unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composites: 

d K ( * max )n  dN (1  )k  

(2.32)

K, n and k are material constants and *max is a nondimensional effective stress defined as: 
2 2   11  11 22   22   12     max  Max       2 X   Y   S   X    *

(2.33)

Where  X,  Y  and  S  are  the  static  tensile  strength,  transverse  strength  and  shear  strength,  respectively.  Ramakrishnan  and  Jayaraman  (1993)  developed  a  stiffnessbased  degradation  model based on the failure of the constituents i.e. fiber, matrix and the interface. The damage  function D is expressed as: 

  

E V E 1  m m Ec  Ec 

   (1  f ) ln( N  1)  f N   ln( N f ) Nf     

(2.34)

In  the  abovementioned  equation,  subscripts  m,  f,  and  c  refer  to  matrix,  fiber  and  composite  constituents,  respectively.  Terms  Vf  and  Ef  correspond  to  fiber  volume  fraction  and  elastic  modulus,  respectively  and  terms  Vm  and  Em  denote  matrix  volume  fraction  and  elastic  modulus,  respectively.  The  factor  f  represents  the  fiber  matrix  interface  strength  parameter  which  varies  between  1  (perfect  bond)  and  0  (debond).  r  denotes  the  ratio  of  the  applied  stress  to  the  ultimate  tensile  stress.  This  model  was  later  extended  by  Shirazi  and  Varvani  (2010)  to  account  for  the  fiber  angle  orientation.  As  for  residual  strength  models,  one  of  the  earliest  models  in  this  category  which  was  introduced  by  Halpin  et  al  (1973)  assumes  that  the 
23   

residual  strength  R(n)  is  a  monotonically  decreasing  function  of  the  number  of  cycles  n  whose  rate of change can be expressed as follows: 

dR(n)  A( )  m1 dn mR(n)     

(2.35)

Where  A()  is  a  function  of  the  maximum  cyclic  stress    and  m  is  a  constant.  Daniel  and  Charewicz  (1986)  proposed  a  model  based  on  the  normalized  change  in  residual  strength  to  study  fatigue  damage  accumulation  in  crossply  graphite/epoxy  laminates.  According  to  this  model: 

n 1  fr   g     N       1  s 

(2.36)

fr=Fr/F0   is the normalized residual stress, s= a/F0 is the normalized applied cyclic stress, N is  the  number  of  cycles  to  failure  at  a  and  g(n/N)  is  a  function  of  the  normalized  number  of  cycles.  Extensive  experimental  and  theoretical  work  by  Schaff  and  Davidson  (1997)  led  to  the  development of a strengthbased spectrum fatigue loading model: 
v

n    R(n)  R0  ( R0  S p )    N

(2.37)

R  is  the  residual  strength;  Sp  is  the  magnitude  of  the  peak  stress  and  v  is  a  parameter  which  takes different values depending upon the rate of degradation:      v  1                     For when the strength degradation is linear      v  1                For when the strength degradation is initially  constant strength  but  (2.38)

24   

decreases drastically close to failure       v  1                      For   when there is a rapid initial loss of strength  Caprino and D'Amore (1998) proposed a residual strength model based on fourpoint bending  fatigue  experiments  conducted  on  a  random  continuous  fiberreinforced  thermoplastic  composite.  According  their  model,  the  residual  strength  undergoes  a  continuous  decay  following a power law: 

d n   a0 . .n b      dn

(2.39)

Where  n  is  the  residual  strength  after  n  cycles,  =maxmin  to  account  for  the  stress  ratio  R  and  a0  and  b  are  constants.  Whithworth  (2000)  developed  a  residual  strength  degradation  model, based on a previously proposed residual stiffness model according to which: 

S R  SU 
  

n   S U  S  N  

(2.40)

SR  and  SU  denote  the  residual  strength  and  the  ultimate  strength  and    is  a  parameter.  The  main  deficiency  of  this  class  of  fatigue  models  is  the  absence  of  any  physicallybased  criteria  for  damage  prediction  and  their  failure  to  account  for  the  fiber  matrix  properties  and  the  effect of loading history (Montesano et al., 2011).  
2.3.1.3 Progressive damage models 

The  main  difference  between  this  class  of  models  with  residual  stiffness/strength  models  is  the  choice  of  a  damage  variable  based  on  the  actual  damage  mechanism  of  the  composite 

25   

such  as  matrix  crack,  interface  failure,  fiber  fracture  or  delaminations.  Bergmann  and  Prinz  (1989)  modeled delamination in graphite/epoxy specimens as follows: 

dAi  c. f (Git ) n      dN

(2.41) 

Where  Ai  is  the  delaminated  area,  Git  denotes  the  maximum  amplitude  of  the  energy  release  rate and c and are experimentally determined values. Feng et al. (1997) proposed a model for  fatigue  damage  life  prediction  based  on  matrix  cracking  in  carbon  fiber  reinforced  specimens.  According  to  this  model  mode  I  of  crack  growth  can  be  described  by  a  modified  version  of  Paris law: 

dA  DG n max    dN  

(2.42) 

In the aforementioned equation, A is the damage area due to matrix cracking, N is the number  of  fatigue  cycles,  Gmax  is  the  maximum  energy  release  rate  in  a  fatigue  cycle,  and  D  and  n  are  material  constants.  Another  model  based  on  matrix  cracking  was  proposed  by  HenaffGradin  et  al.  (2000)  for  crossply  laminates.  The  damage  growth  under  fatigue  in  this  model  is  expressed as: 

 GI  dS  A G   dN  max   

n

(2.43) 

Where  S  is  the  crack  surface,  GI  is  the  strain  energy  release  rate  for  the  current  crack  density,  Gmax  is  the  strain  energy  release rate  at  the  initiation  of  the first  crack  in  the  matrix and  A  and  n  are  constants  determined  from  the  experimental  measurements  of  the  crack  density.  Some  progressive  damage  models  relate  the  damage  mechanism  to  the  residual  mechanical 
26   

properties  mainly  stiffness  or  strength.  One  of  the  first  models  of  this  type  is  the  shear  lag  model  that  calculates  stiffness  reduction  due  to  matrix  cracking.  Highsmith  and  Reifsnider  (1982)  examined  the  edge  replicas  of  crack  patterns  of  various  composite  materials  and  observed  that  shear  deformations  in  any  ply  were  restricted  to  a  thin  region  near  the  interfaces  of  that  ply  with  its  neighboring  plies  so  that  the  transverse  cracks  extended  only  up  to  this  region  but  not  into  it.  These  observations  were  incorporated  into  analytical  differential  equations  to  predict  stiffness  loss.  A  model  relating  stiffness  reduction  to  crack  growth  for  (0/90)s   glass  fiber  reinforced  laminates  was  developed  by  Ogin  et  al  (1985).  According  to  this  model,  it  is  postulated  that  crack  growth  rate  is  a  power  function  of  the  stored  elastic  energy  between  two  adjacent  cracks  in  a  transverse  ply.  The  stiffness  degradation  rate  due  to  transverse matrix cracking is then obtained as: 

   2 max  1 dE  A 2    E0 dN  E 0 (1  E / E0 ) 

n

(2.44) 

In  which  max  is  the  maximum  fatigue  stress  level  and  A  and  n  are  constants.  Assuming  delamination  to  be  the  predominant  damage  mechanism,  Beaumont  (1990)  proposed  the  following damage variable: 

D

A E  2.857(1  ) A0 E0  

(2.45) 

Where  A  is  the  delaminated  area  and  A0  is  the  total  area  between  plies.  The  damage  growth  for a quasiisotropic carbon fiber laminate was then defined as follows: 

27   

    dD   (9.2e5)       dN  R0.1  TS   

6.4

(2.46) 

R  is  the  stress  ratio,  =maxmin  and  TS  is  the  tensile  strength.  The  failure  criterion  to  determine  the  failure  value  Df  in  this  model  was  chosen  to  be  the  strain  failure.  Carswell  (1988) proposed a model for the fatigue life prediction of unidirectional laminates in which the  damage  variable  D  is  related  to  the  length  of  the  matrix  cracks  in  the  laminate  through  the  following damage growth rate: 

D2  dD    p   c N    dN 

(2.47) 

Where p is a parameter and c is the stress amplitude.  Spearing and Beaumont (1992a,1992b)   carried  out  an  extensive  research  on  the  tensile  fatigue  behavior  of  notched  carbon/epoxy  crossply laminates. The dominant damage modes were observed to be splitting in the 00 plies,  delamination  between  the  00  and  900  plies  and  transverse  cracking  in  the  900  plies.  The  damage  was  thus  characterized  by  the  split  length  l  and  delamination  angle  .  Based  on  the  fatigue crack growth law for isotropic materials, the split growth rate is defined as:  

 G   dl      3    dN G    c 

m/2

(2.48)   

Where 3 and m are constants, G is the driving force; Gc is the damage growth resistance. For  an  incremental  growth  l  of  the  split  length,  the  energy  absorbed  in  forming  new  crack  surfaces is calculated as: 

28   

E  Gs tl  Gd (l tan  )l    

(2.49) 

Gs is the absorbed energy per unit area of the split, Gd is the  absorbed energy per unit area of  the delamination, t is the thickness of the 00 ply and  is the delamination angle at the split tip.  A  fatigue  model  based  on  microcracks  in  cross  ply  laminates  was  proposed  by  Caron  and  Ehlacher  (1997)  based  on  the  assumption  that  900  plies  can  be  discretized  in  sections  with  a  random  distribution  of  strength.  In  addition,  it  was  assumed  that  Paris  law  can  be  used  to  model crack propagation and that the residual strength degradation follows: 

d Re  C Re3 S  dN  

(2.50)

Where  Re  is  the  residual  strength,  C  and    are  constants  and  S  is  the  stress  range.  Upon  the  estimation  of  the  residual  life  using  the  foregoing  equation,  the  stresses  in  the  sections  are  calculated and compared to the residual strength through am iterative process. Once a section  breaks,  stresses  are  distributed  and  the  residual  life  of  each  section  is  estimated.  Another  fatigue  life  prediction  model  called  the  generalized  residual  material  property  degradation  model  was  proposed  by  Shokrieh  and  Lessard  (2000a,2000b).  In  this  model,  Hashintype  fatigue  failure  criteria  were  used  for  seven  damage  modes:  Fiber  tension,  fiber  compression,  fibermatrix  shearing,  matrix  tension,  matrix  compression,  normal  tension  and  normal  compression.   For  all  these  damage  modes,  the  corresponding  material  property  is set  to  zero  upon  the  occurrence  of  failure.  Progressive  damage  models  provide  a  more  accurate  tool  for  predicting  the  fatigue  behavior  of  composites  (Degrieck  and  Van  Paepegem,  2001);  however, 

29   

the  implementation  of  these  models  in  numerical  software  specifically  on  a  cycle  by  cycle  basis will be computationally costly. 
2.3.2 Effect of elevated temperature on the fatigue behavior of polymer matrix  composites 

In  the  foregoing  section,  some  of  the  models  developed  to  investigate  the  fatigue  life  of  composite  materials  in  general  and  polymer  matrix  composites  particular  were  reviewed.  In  this  section,  the  effects  of  high  temperature  on  the  fatigue  behavior  of  PMC's  are  presented  through a review of experimental and predictive studies in the literature. 
2.3.2.1 Experimental studies 

Lo  et  al  (1993)  conducted  isothermal  mechanical  fatigue  tests  on  carbon  fiber  /CSPI  at  450o  C  and  room  temperature;  CSPI  being  a  modified  polyimide  developed  at  Shan  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  with  a  glass  transition  temperature  of  511o  C.  Not  surprisingly,  the  fatigue  life  decreased  drastically  at  the  elevated  temperature.  Branco  et  al  (1994)   carried  out  isothermal  fatigue  tests  on  a  glass  fiber  reinforced  Phnolic  BJP  2018L  composite  at  different  temperatures  the  highest  of  which  being  200o  C.  It  was  observed  that  at  higher  temperatures  the  material  stiffness  decreased  consistently,  however,  at  room  temperature,  there  was  little  stiffness  loss  up  until  close  to  failure.   Through  another  study  Branco  et  al  (1996)  found  out  that  the  manufacturing  method  (hand  layup  or  pultrusion)  could  considerably  affect  the  fatigue life of a specimen at high temperatures. Uematsu et al (1995) studied the delamination  of  fiber  reinforced  PEEK  thermoplastic  laminates  due  to  fatigue  loading  at  200o  C.  They  concluded that delamination growth rate increases drastically as a result of high temperature.  Another  study  on  fatigue  delamination  was  conducted  by  Sjogren  and  Asp  (2002)  on  prepreg 
30   

fiberreinforced  epoxy  laminates  subject  to  flexural  and  mixed  mode  bending  fatigue  loading  at  100o  C.  The  critical  and  threshold  energy  release  rate  was  found  to  have  decreased  with  increasing  temperature  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  delamination  growth  rate.  Gyekenyesi  et  al  (1995)  carried  out  an  experimental  study  on  a  woven  fiberreinforced  AMB21  polyimide  resin  matrix  composite.  They  observed  that  in  case  of  static  tensile  tests,  temperature  had  little effect on the modulus and ultimate stress and strain. However, the effect of temperature  (255o  C  in  their  experiments)  on  the  fatigue  life  of  the  composite  was  seen  to  be  significant.  Another  effect  of  high  temperature  was  the  ratcheting  of  the  stressstrain  curve  during  tensiontension fatigue which was attributed to fiber fracture, matrix cracking and viscoelastic  deformation.  The  effect  of  time  and  temperature  on  the  flexural  behavior  of  unidirectional  CFRP laminates under fatigue loading was studied by Miyano et al (1994). The fatigue behavior  was  observed  to  be  significantly  dependent  on  both  temperature  and  loading  frequency  as  a  result  of  the  viscelastic  behavior  of  the  matrix  material.  Case  et  al  (1997)  studied  the  fatigue  behavior of notched unidirectionalply fiberreinforced K3B resin laminate at a temperature of  177o C. Elevated temperature was seen to speed up delamination and matrix cracking. Castelli  et  al  (1998)  conducted  thermomechanical  fatigue  tests  on  chopped  fiberreinforced  PMR15  matrix  composites  at  a  maximum  temperature  of  260o  C.  They  concluded  that  thermo mechanical loading does not degrade material properties as much compared fatigue testing at  a  constant  temperature.  Kawai  et  al  (2001)  studied  the  effect  of  temperature  and  the  offaxis  angle  on  the  fatigue  behavior  of  unidirectional  fiberreinforced  polymer  composites.  It  was  found  out  the  effect  of  high  temperature  became  more  prominent  for  offaxis  loading  where  the  matrix  share  of  the  load  increases.  Gregory  and  Spearing  (2005)  conducted  static  and 
31   

fatigue  tests  on  unidirectional  fiberreinforced  9773  resin  at  different  temperatures  the  maximum  of  which  being  149o  C.  The  toughness  of  the  composite  was  seen  to  increase  at  higher  temperatures  when  subjected  to  tensile  testing  in  flexure  probably  due  to  the  fiber  bridging  phenomenon.  It  was  also  observed  that  elevated  temperature  sped  up  delamination  and  crack  propagation  due  to  the  decrease  in  the  resin  yield  strength.  The  effect  of  high  temperature on the fatigue behavior of notched woven fiberreinforced 1053 epoxy laminates  was investigated by Shimokawa et al (2007). The tests were conducted at 110o C. The effect of  high temperature on the strength degradation was found out to be minimal in tensiontension  fatigue,  however,  the  strength  degradation  in  compressioncompression  and  tension compression was significant because of the dependence of the laminate compressive strength  on  the  matrix  behavior.  The  experimentally  based  models  are  specific  to  certain  types  of  composites  so  that  the  results  cannot  be  readily  generalized  to  other  types  of  composite  materials. 
2.3.2.2 Predictive models 

Predictive  fatigue  models  taking  the  effect  of  high  temperature  into  account  may  fall  into  one  of  the  three  categories  previously  mentioned  i.e.  the  fatigue  life  models,  residual  stiffness/strength  phenomenological  models  and  the  progressive  damage  models.  However,  the  emphasis  in  this  section  is  on  the  implementation  of  the  effect  of  temperature  into  the  fatigue  life  of  the  composite.  Shah  et  al  (1995)  took  into  account  the  effect  of  temperature  along  with  other  factors  including  fiber  longitudinal  strength,  exposure  time,  mechanical  and  thermal cyclic loading on the material property degradation through a multifactor interaction  equation (MFIE):

(2.51)

The  exponent  of  each  parenthesis  controls  the  amount  of  degradation  of  that  very  term.   The  nomenclature of the abovementioned equation is as follows:  MP: A general material property, MPO: The reference material property, T: Temperature,   S:  Strength, : Stress, N: Number of cycles and t: time  Superscripts:  gw:  Wet  glass  transition  temperature,  M:  Mechanical  load,  f:  final  condition,  T:  Thermal  cyclic  load.  Miyano  et  al.  (1997),  Miyano  et  al.  (2000)  and  Miyano  et  al.  (2005)    have  proposed  a  formulation  for  fatigue  strength  of  PMC's  at  elevated  temperatures  where  the  effect  of  viscoelasticity.  According  to  this  model,  the  fatigue  life  of  a PMC  material  should  be  described  as  a  combination  of  static  fatigue  that  is  the  strength  degradation  under  the  action  of  the  static load i.e. creep and degradation of the strength due to  the cyclic component of  the load.  Since  the  creep  loading  is  considered  as  fatigue  loading  with  a  stress  ratio  R=1  at  any  given  frequency,  the  fatigue  strength  f(tf,R,f,T)  for  an  arbitrary  frequency  (f),  stress  ratio  R,  and  temperature (T) is:  

 f (t f , f , R, T )   f ,R1 (t f , f , T )   f ,R0 (t f , f , T )(1  R)

(2.52)   

where  f,R=1    and  f,R=0  are  the  fatigue  strength  for  R=1  and  0,  respectively.  The  major  assumptions  of  this  model  are:  strength  independence  of  the  loading  rate,  the  linear  cumulative  damage  law  for  monotonic  loading  and  linear  dependence  of  fatigue  strength  on 
33   

stress  ratio.  Kawai  et  al  (2001)  studied  the  offaxis  behavior  of  unidirectional  fiberreinforced  polymer  matrix  composite  from  a  phenomenological  viewpoint.  In  their  model,  fatigue  damage  was  represented  by  two  damage  variables  f  and  m  for  fiber  and  matrix,  respectively. The growth equations for these damage variables were:

 K,  n  and  k  are  material  constants.  *max  is  the  maximum  value  of  the  nondimensional  effective  stress.  The  following  fatigue  life  equations  were  derived  from  the  abovementioned  equations.

Mahieux  et  al  (2001)  incorporated  the  effects  of  temperature  on  the  strength  and  stiffness  of  unidirectional  polymer  matrix  composites  into  a  fatigue  model  developed  by  Reifsnider  and  Stinchomb  (  1986).  The  fatigue  model  is  based  on  a  residual  strength  integral  expression  defined as: 

Fr  1   1  Fa( ) j j 1d
0



(2.57)   

34   

The above equation relates the remaining strength Fr to Fa , a failure function which is defined  as the ratio  between the maximum applied strain in bending fatigue and the ultimate strain.   is  a  characteristic  time  which  for  fatigue  loading  is  =n/Nf   and  j  is  a  material  parameter.  The  effect of temperature is assumed to be on the polymer matrix modulus in accordance with: 

 T Em (T )  EN exp     T   N

   

mN

 T mi   N 1    ( E  E ) exp    i i 1   T       i     i1

K  is  the  number  of  property  transition  in  the  polymer  matrix;  Ti  and  mi  are  the  transition  temperature  and  the  statistical  coefficient  for  the  ith  transition,  respectively.  Jen  et  al  (2006)  proposed  a  semiempirical  fatigue  model  for  notched  AS4/PEEK  APC2  polymer  matrix  composite laminates at elevated temperatures up to 150o C as follows:

d/W  is  the  ratio  of  the  hole  diameter  d  to  the  specimen  width.  Tm  is  the  melting  temperature,  TT  is  the  test  temperature.  0  and    denote  the  ultimate  strength  at  room  temperature  and  maximum stress at the elevated temperature, respectively.  The  abovegiven  survey  of  the  works  in  the  area  shows  that  the  bulk  of  the  research  studies  conducted  on  high  temperature  polymer  matrix  materials  are  experimental.  Applications  of  polymer  matrix  composites  in  automotive  and  aerospace  industries  usually  involve  the  exposure of the material to high temperatures for lengthy periods of time.   There  are  two  major  problems  associated  with  experimental  investigation  of  PMC's  at  elevated  temperatures.  First,  performing  experiments  on  the  material  or  structure  for  such 
35   

long  periods  is  not  economically  feasible.  Secondly,  elevated  temperature  limits  the  use  of  conventional  testing  equipment  and  techniques.  That's  why  there  is  an  ever  increasing  demand  for  the  development  of  suitable  theoretical  models  for  accelerated  characterization  of  PMC  materials  subject  to  high  temperatures.  Analysis  and  prediction  of  the  behavior  of  the  composite  material  demand  the  knowledge  of  the  behavior  of  each  of  the  constituent  components.  On  the  other  hand,  at  elevated  temperatures  the  viscoelastic  effects  of  the  polymer  matrix  are  more  significant.  The  major  drawback  of  the  existing  analytical  models  is  their  failure  to  directly  account  for  the  viscoelasticity  of  the  matrix  material  in  particular  its  role  on  the  on  the  fatigue  failure  of  polymer  matrix  composites.  In  addition,  these  models  heavily  depend  on  experimental  parameters  which  thus  makes  them  too  specific  usually  applicable to one particular class of PMC's.   Regarding  the  aforementioned  shortcomings,  the  present  research  work  focuses  on  two  main  objectives:  first,  studying  the  effect of  temperature  on  the  elastic  and  viscoelastic  response  of  polymer  matrix  composites,  and  second,  proposing  a  methodology  to  investigate  the  role  of  viscoelasticity  on  the  fatigue  failure  of  polymer  matrix  composite  materials  at  room  and  high  temperatures through a micromechanical approach.

CHAPTER 3: SIMPLIFIED UNIT CELL MICROMECHANICAL MODEL 
Analytical  Research  studies  conducted  so  far  on  the  response  of  polymer  matrix  composites  are  based  on  macromechanics  which  predict  the  failure  of  composite  as  a  bulk  material.  However,  failure  in  polymer  matrix  materials  is  a  localized  phenomenon  which  demands  a  sufficiently  accurate  stress  analysis  of  the  representative  volume  element.  That's  why  micromechanical  analysis  gives  a  far  better  insight  into  the  failure  mechanisms  of  the  composite materials. In fact, through micromechanics, the modes of failure in fiber and matrix  can be separately identified which helps modify the stiffnesses of the constituents accordingly.  In  particular,  since  at  high  temperatures,  the  general  behavior  of  the  polymer  matrix  composite  is  governed  by  matrix  viscoelasticity,  the  need  for  micromechanical  analysis  becomes more crucial. Other advantages of micromechanics include the study of the effects of  thermal residual stresses and reinforcement volume fraction.   No  work  has  hitherto  taken  into  account  the  viscoelastic  behavior  of  the  matrix  material  of  PMC's  within  a  micromechanical  framework  to  study  the  response  of  polymer  matrix  composites  at  high  temperatures.  In  reality,  fibers  are  randomly  distributed  within  the  matrix  material.  However,  for  the  sake  of  brevity,  in  the  micromechanical  model,  a  representative  volume  element  (RVE)  is  defined  such  that  it  represents  a  small  repeatable  area  of  the  cross  section of the composite with the same effective properties as those of the composite system.  One  of  the  early  analytical  models based  on  the  concept  of  RVE,  is  the Method  of  Cells  (MOC)  originally  developed  by  Aboudi  (1982)  in  which  for  the  first  time,  the  fiber  cross  section  was  assumed to be square. MOC, although wellknown, is mathematically rigorous (Robertson and  Mall, 1993,1994).  
37   

The  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  (SUCM)  model  is  a  simplified  form  of  the  Method  of  Cells (MOC) developed by Aghdam et al. (2000) to study the collapse behavior of metalmatrix  composites  under  thermomechanical  loading  as  well  as  modeling  the  interface  damage  of  metalmatrix  composites  subject  to  transverse  loading.  While  maintaining  the  same  level  of  accuracy  as  MOC,  the  SUCM  has  a  much  simpler  mathematical  procedure.  The  main  advantage  of  the  present  micromechanical  model  lies  in  its  ability  to  give  closed  form  solutions  for  the  effective  nonlinear  response  of  unidirectional  composites  and  to  predict  the  material  response  to  any  combination  of  shear  and  normal  loading.  Although  both  SUCM  and  MOC yield similar results for the overall elastic moduli of unidirectional composites, the SUCM  has,  in  fact,  been  found  to  give  a  better  prediction  for  the  overall  transverse  Poisson  ratio  (Aghdam  and  Dezhsetan,  2005).  The  model  was  later  extended  to  include  the  nonlinear  viscoelastic properties in closed form functions (Falahatgar et al., 2009). 

3.1

Matrix Material Constitutive Equation 

The  matrix  material  is  modeled  based  on  Schapery's  single  integral  constitutive  equation  in  which  the  integral  part  can  be  calculated  through  a  recursive  scheme.  The  total  strain  can  therefore be written as (HajAli and Muliana, 2004b):  
 
N

 (t )   g 0 t D0  g1t g 2 t  Dn  1 
n 1

 

1  exp(n  t )    (t ) n  t 

          (3.1)  

  1  exp(n  t ) t t t t  t  g1  Dn exp(n  t )qn  g 2  (t  t ) t n  n 1  
N

Where  D0  is  the  uniaxial  elastic  compliance,  N  is  the  number  of  terms,  Dn  is  nth  coefficient  of  the  Prony  series  and  n  is  the  nth  reciprocal  of  the  retardation  time.  g0,  g1  and  g2  are  the 

38   

nonlinear  material  properties  which  are  in  general  stress  dependent.  Also  the  reduced  time  increment is defined by: 

 t   t  t  t 

d a( , T ) t  t



t

(3.2)  

and the hereditary integral qnt for every term of the Prony series at the end of the current time  is calculated as follows:  

  1  exp(n  t ) t t t  t t  t qn  exp(n  t )qn  g 2  (t )  g 2  (t  t )  t n    





(3.3)

The  parameter  a(,T)  is  the  total  time  shift  factor  which  is  measured  with  respect  to  the  reference  stress  and  temperature.  The  total  time  shift  factor  can  be  assumed  to  be  in  the  following form (Walrath, 1991): 

a( , T )  a ( )aT (T )  

(3.4)

The  nonlinear  parameters  in  Schapery's  model,  g0()=g1()=g2()=  a()=1  when  the  applied  stress  is  sufficiently  small,  i.e.  the  material  exhibits  linear  behavior  (Lai  and  Bakker,  1996).   If  the  temperature  effects  can  be  accounted  for  only  through  the  shift  factor  aT(T),  the  material  is  called  thermorheologically  simple  (TSM),  otherwise  it  is  classified  as  a  thermorheologically  complex  material  (TCM).The  multiaxial  material  constitutive  equation  for  the  matrix  material  is (Falahatgar et al., 2010): 

 ij (t )  (1  m )Sc (t ) ij (t )  m Sc (t ) ll (t ) ij  (1  m ) Rij (t )  m Rll (t ) ij

The  matrix  instantaneous  creep  compliance  Sc(t)    and  the  hereditary  creep  strains  Rij(t)  are  defined as: 
N  t  1  exp(n  t )  t t  Sc (t )   g 0 D0  g1 g 2  Dn  t 1      n  1 n

Assumptions of the Micromechanical Model 

As  mentioned  earlier,  in  the  SUCM  model,  it  is  assumed  that  the  composite  material  can  be  represented  by  rectangular  cross  section  fiber  and  matrix  subcells.  Figure  3.1  shows  the  corresponding RVE of the composite lamina. As can be seen, due to symmetry the quarter unit  cell  is  divided  to  four  subcells,  one  fiber  and  three  matrix  subcells.  The  fiber  i.e.  the  longitudinal  direction  is  assumed  to  be  along  the  x1  axis  and  the  other  two  axes,  x2  and  x3,  represent  the  transverse  directions.  One  major  assumption  in  the  SUCM  model  is  that  the  displacement  components  are  linear  which  results  in  constant  stress  and  strain  within  the  subcells. It has been shown by Aboudi (1982) that this is a sufficiently accurate assumption for  modeling composites subjected to different loading modes. It is also assumed that normal and  shear  loadings  can  be  dealt  with  independently  from  one  another.  This  indicates  that  the  normal stress in the RVE does not induce any shear stresses in the subcells.

Normal Response of the Composite 

Figure  3.2  shows  the  RVE  under  normal  transverse  stresses.  Assuming  that  the  subcells  are  perfectly bonded the compatibility of displacements in the RVE can be written as follows:

In  the  abovementioned  equations  kii  denotes  micro  or  local  strains  in  the  kth  subcell  and   ii   represents  the  macro  or  global  strains  as  a  result  of  the  applied  macro  or  global  stresses   ii   .  Traction  continuity  conditions  at  the  interfaces  between  the  subcells  are  satisfied  provided  that:

(3.12) (3.13) (3.14)

The  fiber  material  is  assumed  to  be  linearly  elastic  and  transversely  isotropic  whereas  the  matrix is assumed to be viscoelastic. Equation 3.5 denotes the constitutive equation for matrix  material which takes the following form under normal loading:

Figure  3.3  shows  the  RVE  under  shear  loading.  Similar  to  normal  loading,  the  equilibrium  and  continuity  equations  need  to  be  satisfied  in  the  case  of  shear  loading.  The  Equilibrium  requirement relates the local and global shear stresses as follows:

Micromechanical Analysis of the Composite Strength  

Unlike the macromechanical approach where failure is controlled by the properties of the bulk  composite  material,  in  a  micromechanical  analysis,  the  failure  of  each  of  the  constituents  i.e.  fiber  and  matrix  has  to  be  investigated  separately.  However,  in  many  cases,  the  ultimate  strengths of the fiber and matrix constituents are not readily available or are not always given  by  those  measured  from  the  bulk  fiber  or  matrix  materials  (Aboudi,  1988).  Therefore,  good  estimates of the ultimate strengths of the constituents are needed for the prediction of failure  of  a  unidirectional  composite  material.  These  constituents'  strengths  can  be  obtained  using  micromechanical analysis.  Since the micromechanical model is capable of calculating the local 
(k ) stresses   ij  i.e. the stresses in the fiber and matrix subcells from globally applied stresses   ij   

45   

,  it  can  be  used  to  find  the  ultimate  strengths  of  the  fiber  and  matrix  constituents  from  the  knowledge  of  the  allowable  stresses  or  strengths  of  the  unidirectional  composite  in  the  principal  material  directions  i.e.  in  longitudinal,  transverse  and  loadings.  Based  on  the  SUCM 
(k ) model, the globally applied stresses   ij  can be related to the subcell stresses   ij   as follows: 

{ }k  C { }  

  (3.33)

 It  should  be  noted  that the  elements  of  [C]  are  functions  of  the  material  property  of  the  fiber  and  the  matrix  material.  Based  on  this  concept,  if  X,  Y  and  S  denote,  respectively  the  axial,  transverse  and  inplane  shearing  strengths  of  the  composite,  Xf  (the  longitudinal  ultimate  stress  of  the  fiber),  Ym  (the  tensile  strength  of  the  matrix),  and  Sm  (the  shear  strength  of  the  matrix) can be calculated as follows:

CHAPTER 4: THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE VISCOELASTIC  RESPONSE OF POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES 
In  this  chapter,  the  thermomechanical  viscoelastic  response  of  a  high  temperature  polymer  matrix  composite  system  made  up  of  T65035  graphite  fibers  embedded  in  PMR15  resin  is  studied through the Simplified Unit Cell Micromechanical (SUCM) model within a temperature  range  of  250  to  300o  C  corresponding  to  aerospace  engine  applications.  Using  the  experimental  data  of  the  creep  behavior  of  thermostable  PMR15  polyimide,  the  micromechanical  model  is  first  calibrated  to  account  for  the  effect  of  temperature.  The  resulting  elastic  and  viscoelastic  responses  are  compared  with  the  existing  experimental  data.  The  validated  model  is  then  used  to  predict  the  behavior  of  the  composite  material  under  different combinations of thermal and mechanical loadings.   Polymers  are  generally  classified  as  either  Thermoreheologically  Simple  Materials  (TSM)  or  Thermorheologically  Complex  Materials  (TCM).  In  the  former,  the  effect  of  temperature  is  incorporated  only  through  a  timescale  shift  factor  (Harper  and  Weitsman,  1985).  This  assumption  is  valid  as  long  as  the  configuration  of  the  polymer  molecular  structure  and  thus  its  elastic  and  longterm  responses  are  not  affected  by  the  temperature.  However,  as  the  temperature  of  the  composite  increases,  the  polymer  matrix  becomes  more  compliant  and  the  composite's  matrix  dominated  constants  (shear  and  transverse  moduli)  decrease  drastically (Odegard and Kumosa, 2000). In such cases the overall timedependent behavior of  the  composite  is  governed  by  the  matrix  viscoelasticity.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  that  the  polymer  matrix  in  high  temperature  PMC's  be  considered  as  a  Thermorheologically  Complex  Material (TCM).  
48   

The  nonlinear  viscoelastic  behavior  of  polymers  has  been  studied  mainly  for  particulate  composites.  Ozupek  and  Becker  (1992,1997)   developed  a  constitutive  model  for  viscoelastic  materials  to  study  the  mechanical  behavior  of  solid  rocket  propellants  which  are  in  fact,  particulate composites  with a lightly crosslinked elastomeric binder. Temperature effects and  a  large  range  of  deformations  result  in  a  highly  nonlinear  response  of  the  material.  Later,  Conga  et  al.  (2001)  presented  the  computational  implementation  of  this  model  with  damage  using  the  finite  element  method.  Ha  and  Schapery  (1998)  developed  and  experimentally  verified  a  threedimensional  nonlinear  viscoelastic  model  for  particlefilled  rubbers  including  damage.  It  was  assumed  that  damage  led  to  transverse  isotropy  with  the  axis  of  isotropy  coinciding  with  the  local,  instantaneous  maximum  principle  stress  direction  for  monotonic  loading.   Few  works  have  hitherto  incorporated  micromechanical  models  to  study  the  nonlinear  viscoelastic  response  of  TCM  polymer  matrix  composites  at  high  temperatures.  Hashin  et  al.  (1987)  modeled  a  unidirectional  fiber  composite  with  a  TCM  matrix  by  concentric  cylinder  assemblage  to  predict  its  thermoviscoelastic  response.  Sadkin  and  Aboudi  (1989)  used  the  method  of  cell  (MOC)  to  study  the  viscoelasic  response  of  TCM  resin  matrix  composites.  The  aforementioned models assume that the isotropic matrix is viscoelastic in shear only. Recently  Muliana  et  al.  (2008)  derived  a  micromechanical  model  for  TCM  polymer  matrix  composites  with a temperature range of 23o C to 65o C.  From  among  different  polymer  matrix  resins,  the  PMR15  polyimide  has  been  designed  to  operate  under  extreme  thermomechanical  loading  of  carbon/PMR15  composites  usable  in 

49   

military  aeroengine  applications  within  a  temperature  range  of  250  to  300o  C  (Rupnowski  et  al., 2006).  Odegard et al. (2000) measured the elastic properties of a unidirectional composite  based  on  T65035  graphite  fibers  embedded  in  a  PMR15  polyimide  resin  for  a  temperature  range  from  25  to  315o  C  experimentally.  However,  micromechanical  modeling  of  the  viscoelastic  behavior  of  carbon/PMR15  composites  subject  to  high  temperatures  is  still  lacking.  One  important  issue  which  must  be  taken  into  account  for  high  temperature  polymer  materials  is  a  phenomenon  called  chemical  aging  which  refers  to  an  irreversible  change  in  the  polymer  chain/network  through  mechanisms  such  as  crosslinking  or  chain  scission.  One  example  of  chemical  aging  is  oxidation  which  takes  place  when  the  material  is  exposed  at  elevated  temperatures  (close  to  the  glass  transition  temperature)  to  oxygenrich  environments  for  long  periods  of  time.  Significant  shrinkage  strains  are  induced  due  to  thermooxidation in the resin that can lead to the development of micromechanical damage in  the material (Pochiraju et al., 2008).

Effect of Temperature on the Modulus of the Polymer Matrix 

Fiber  reinforced  polymer  matrix  materials  fall  into  the  category  of  vicoelastic  materials  due  to  their  polymer  matrix  constituent  and  this  vicoelasticity  effect  of  the  polymer  matrix  becomes  more pronounce as the temperature increases. Figure 4.1 schematically shows how the Young  modulus  of  a  typical  polymer  changes  with  temperature.  As  illustrated  in  the  figure,  four  regions  of  viscoelastic  behavior  can  be  identified  as  the  glassy,  transition,  rubbery  and  flow.  Two  important  temperatures  are  extracted  from  the  curve  of  figure  4.1:  namely  the  glass  transition  temperature  Tg  and  the  melt  temperature  Tm.  Tg  is  the  temperature  at  which  the  polymer starts changing from a brittle or glassy state into a rubbery or soft state.

Time Temperature Superposition (TTS) Principle 

According  to  the  time  temperature  superposition  principle  the  viscoelastic  behavior  at  one  temperature can be related to that of another temperature by a change in time scale (Brinson  and  Brinson,  2008).  Using  TTS,  one  can  characterize  the  viscoelastic  properties  of  a  material  over  a  long  time  by  obtaining  data  at  different  temperatures  over  a  short  period  of  time.  This  is  done  through  creating  the  so  called  master  curve  by  shifting  the  material  property  (modulus,  compliance  or  Poisson's  ratio)  horizontally  and  vertically  versus  time  on  a  loglog  scale to a reference temperature. The resulting master curve is then used to show  the change  of  that  property  over  a  long  period  of  time  which  would  have  otherwise  been  impossible  to  obtain by doing experiment. Mathematically, this principle can be stated as:   
P(T1 , t )  P(T2 , t )b(T )   a(T )
51   

(4.1)

Where  T  is  the  temperature,  P  is  the  property  under  consideration  and  a(T)  and  b(T)  denote  the horizontal and vertical shift factor. Figure 4.2 shows schematically how the master curve is  generated  for  the  modulus  of  a  viscoelastic  material.  If  the  temperature  effects  can  be  accounted  for  only  through  the  shift  factor  a(T),  the  material  is  called  thermorheologically  simple (TSM) otherwise it is classified as a thermorheologically complex material (TCM).

The Viscoelastic Response of ThermoStable PMR15 

As  previously  mentioned,  the  PMR15  resin  is  used  in  composite  materials  under  thermomechanical  loading  conditions  in  aerospace  applications.  The  PMR15  matrix  is  considered to be thermally stable up to about 300o C and the composite system is designed to  operate  in  temperatures  between  250  and  300o  C.  Marais  and  Villoutreix  (1998)  studied  the  behavior  of  PMR15  polyimide  by  performing  tests  under  different  conditions  of  stress  and  time.  The  loading  time  for  each  stress  level  was  chosen  as  the  mean  time  during  which  the  material operates in real application in a military aircraft engine. The tests were carried out at 
52   

four  different  temperatures  to  determine  the  maximum  stress  below  which  the  material  can  be  considered  linear.  The  linear  range  ensures  the  integrity  of  the  mechanical  properties  of  the  resin  in  case  the  composite  system  is  subjected  to  repeated  loading.  The  limit  for  the  linear  range  was  found  to  be  between  0.6r  for  250o  C  and  0.3r  for  300o  C  where  r  is  the  static  tensile  failure  stress  measured  to  be  47MPa  within  the  temperature  range  under  consideration,  which  alludes  to  the  thermal  stability  of  PMR15  polyimide.  Based  on  the  obtained  experimental  data,  the  creep  compliance  of  PMR15  within  the  linear  range  was  assumed to take the following form (Marais and Villoutreix, 1998): 

  t b    1   1       t  J     E   E    1  exp           1  2           

(4.2)

Where    denotes  the  retardation  time,  b  is  the  Kohlrausch  coefficient  which  varies  between  0  and  1  and    is  the  viscosity.  These  parameters  are  adjusted  based  on  the  experimental  data.  The  abovementioned  experimental  data  is  used  to  calibrate  the  matrix  subcells  in  the  micromechainal  model  to  account  for  the  effect  of  temperaturce  on  the  response  of  the  composite material. The creep compliance in Equation 4.2 is seen to be composed of an elastic  part  and  a  time  dependent  viscous  part.  Now  considering  Equation  3.1,  since  the  study  of  the  PMR15  resin  is  within  the  linear  range,  the  following  assumptions  can  be  made:  1)  The  nonlinear  coefficients  i.e.  g0,  g1,  g2  and  a  are  set  equal  to  1.  2)  The  creep  compliance  can  be  defined based on the proportionality between the strain  and the stress . It can be observed  that  the  matrix  material  response  also  consists  of  an  elastic  portion  as  well  as  a  time  dependent  viscoelastic  part.   Hence,  the  calibration  of  the  micromechanical  model  is  carried 
53   

out  following  the  equivalence  between  Equations  3.1  and  4.1.   f1  (T)  is  thus  curve  fitted  so  as  to  account  for  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  elastic  response  of  the  material.  In  other  words,  The  function  f1(T)  is  determined  from  measuring  the  initial  creep  response  of  the  material, i.e. at t=0 at different temperatures.

(4.3)

Table  4.1  lists  the  Prony  series  terms  for  PMR15.  The  first  attempt  to  calibrate  the  time  dependent  part  is  to  use  the  time  temperature  shifting  parameter  a(T),  which  for  PMR15  is  defined as follows (Muliana and Sawant, 2009)[39]:   

a (T )  0.00001333T 3  0.011T 2  3.0087T  272  

(4.4)

The  time  temperature  shifting  parameter  a(T)  is  calculated  from  the  wellknown  Time  Temperature  Superposition  Principle  (TTSP)  stating  that  the  viscoelastic  behavior  at  one  temperature  can  be  related  to  that  of  another  temperature  by  a  change  in  time  scale.  For  thermorheologically simple material, the creep compliance at one temperature can be related  to  another  temperature  by  applying  the  temperature  shift  factor.  However,  since  PMR15  is  a  thermorheologically  complex  material,  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  shift  factor  alone,  as  shown  in Figure  4.3,  cannot  represent  the  experimental  data  properly,  especially  for  higher  temperatures  (285  and  300o  C).  Therefore,  a  function  f2(T)  is  also  included  to  account  for  the  thermorheologically  complex  behavior  of  the  material.  The  temperature  dependent  constitutive equation is therefore written as: 

54   

N  1  exp( n  t )    (t )  f1 (T ) D0 (t )  f 2 (T )  Dn  t 1   (t )     1 n n    N   1  exp( n  t ) t  t   g1  Dn exp(n  t )qn   (t  t ) t n  n 1

Figure  4.4  shows  that  a  good  fit  to  the  experimental  data  is  achieved  for  different  temperatures  after  including  f2  (t).  It  can  be  seen  that  the  maximum  error  for  the  highest  temperature  i.e.  300o  C,  with  respect  to  experimental  data,  drops  to  3.5%      from  20.9%    before  the  introduction  of  f2(T)  as  shown  in  Figure  4.3.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  functions  obtained  above  are  valid  only  within  the  specified  temperature  range.  In  order  to  expand  the  model  to  a  temperature  outside  of  this  range,  experiments  need  to  be  conducted  either  at  that  very  temperature  or  at  a  lower  temperature.  The  methodology  proposed  here  is  totally  experimentdependent which serves as a complement to the Time Temperature Superposition  Principle  (TTSP)  to  incorporate  the  effect  of  temperature  into  the  viscoelastic  behavior  of  the  matrix material through the use of Schapery equation.

Elastic Properties of Unidirectional T65035/PMR15 Composite as a  Function of Temperature  

Odegard  and  Kumosa  (2000)  have  measured  the  elastic  properties  of  unidirectional  T650 35/PMR15  composite  experimentally.  To  further  validate  the  present  approach,  the  temperature  dependent  micromechanical  model  is  used  to  calculate  the  elastic  properties  of  unidirectional  T65035/PMR15  composite  with  56%  fiber  volume  fraction  and  the  results  are  compared with available experimental data as well as with the MoriTanaka approach used by  Rupnowski et al. (2006).   The  elastic  properties  of  T65035  fibers  are  shown  in  Table  4.2.  These  properties  are  assumed  to  be  temperature  independent.  As  shown  in  Figure  4.5,  the  results  are  in  reasonable  agreement with the literature. It can be seen that the fiber dominated properties, i.e. the axial  modulus  and  the  longitudinal  Poisson's  ratio  do  not  significantly  change  with  temperature  (Figures 4.5a and 4.5d), whereas the transverse and shear moduli which are dominated by the  matrix  properties  degrade  as  the  temperature  increases  (Figures  4.5b  and  4.5c).  In  other  words,  the  degradation  of  fiber  dominated  properties  with  temperature  compared  to  that  of  the  matrix  dominated  properties  is  not  as  significant.  Regarding  the  scattered  nature  of  the  reported  experimental  data  and  thus  considering  the  closer  experimental  data  point  to  the  calculated  results  ,  the  mean  absolute  percentage  errors  (MAPE)  for  the  transverse  modulus  and the shear modulus are calculated to be  8%  and 18% , respectively. Having established the  validity  of  the  present  model,  we  now  consider  the  response  of  the  T65035/PMR15  composite system to thermomechanical loading.

Thermomechanical Response under a Linearly Increasing Stress 

The stressstrain responses of T65035/PMR15  under a monotonically increasing stress at the  rate  of  1  MPa/sec  using  the  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  (SUCM)  model  are  shown  in  Figures  4.6  and  4.7  for  the  transverse  tension  and  longitudinal  shear  loads  at  different  temperatures.  It  can  be  seen  that  both  of  these  load  cases  are  affected  by  temperature  and  that  this  effect  becomes  more  pronounced  as  the  load  increases.  The  maximum  difference 
58   

between  the  values  of  axial  and  shear  strains  for  the  lowest  and  highest  temperatures  at  the  end  of  the  loading  time  is  estimated  to  be  34%  and  45%,  respectively.  These  observations  are  in  agreement  with  the  experimental  tests  depicted  in  Figure  4.5  indicating  the  temperature  dependence of matrix dominated properties of the composite. From a physical perspective, it can 
be  deduced  that  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  viscosity  of  the  fluid  phase  of  the  viscoelastic  material  to  decrease  such  that  the  external  load  will  thus  be  supported  only  by  the  solid  phase  which  as a result will decrease the modulus.

Thermomechanical Creep Loading 

Figure  4.8  shows  the  response  of  the  composite  system  to  a  constant  transverse  stress  of  1  MPa at four different temperatures. Figure 4.9 shows the creep strain response under a linear  temperature  ramp.  In  both  Figures  4.8  and  4.9  the  acceleration  of  the  creep  strain  and  softening  of  the  initial  and  timedependent  portions  of  the  composite  response  with  increasing  temperature  are  apparent.  In  particular,  as  Figure  4.9  shows,  the  change  in  the  material response for higher temperatures, i.e. above 275o C is observed to be more abrupt.

The  next  step  is  to  predict  the  response  of  the  composite  to  a  cyclic  temperature  change.  Since  this  kind  of  composite  is  for  potential  applications  at  temperatures  between  250  and  300o  C,  the  temperature  cycle  is  defined  as  shown  in  Figure  4.10a  with  extremes  of  250  and  300o  C  within  a  period  of  5  hours  based  on  the  average  duration  of  loading  of  a  real  military  aircraft.  The  transverse  normal  strain  produced  by  the  combination  of  creep  and  cyclic 

61   

temperature  loading  is  shown  in  Figure  4.10b.  The  total  strain  is  seen  to  increase  due  to  the  accumulation  of  creep  strain  during  each  cycle.  However,  this  increase  becomes  less  pronounced  from  cycle  to  cycle  as  the  number  of  the  cycles  increases.  In  addition,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  rate  of  the  strain  change  between  250o  C  and  275o  C  i.e.  within  the  second  half  of  each  cycle  is  much  less  compared  to  the  first  half.  This  is  attributed  to  functions  f1  (T)  and    f2  (T)  described  in  Equations  4.3  and  4.6,  respectively  to  fit  the  experimental  data.  Figure  4.11  shows these two functions versus temperature. As the figure shows, the rate of the change of  these two functions between the 250 and 275o C is much lower than between 275 and 300o C.

Figure 4.12 depicts isochronous stressstrain curves for different temperatures after 5 hours. It  is  observed  that  as  the  stress  increases,  the  curves  diverge  and  that  the  increase  of  temperature gives rise to the softening of the material and consequently the creep strain.

Elastic versus Viscoelastic Response 

In  this  section,  the  T65035/PMR15  is  subjected  to  a  monotonically  increasing  transverse  normal  stress  and  the  response  of  the  composite  material  is  studied  with  and  without  considering  the  time  dependent  portion  of  Equation  4.5.  Figure  4.13  shows  the  difference  between the resulting strains versus time at different temperatures. It can be seen that as the  temperature  increases,  so  does  the  difference  between  the  elastic  and  viscoelastic  response  indicating  the  prominence  of  viscoelasticity  with  increasing  temperatures.  This  increase  becomes  most  noticeable  for  the  highest  temperature  i.e.  T=300o  C.  This,  in  fact,  corresponds  to  figure  4.4  where  the  creep  compliance  increases  at  a  much  higher  rate  with  time  for  this  temperature.

Creep Recovery and Reloading 

Figure  4.14  shows  the  strain  evolution  upon  loadingunloading  and  reloading  for  the  T650 35/PMR15 composite for different stress levels at T=250o C where r is the static tensile failure  stress  of  the  PMR15  matrix  material.  It  can  be  seen  that  after  the  material  is  unloaded  and  allowed  to  relax  for  2  hours,  the  strain  does  not  recover  completely.  Another  important  point  to  be  noted  is  that  the  instantaneous  compliance  of  the  material  to  the  load  as  well  as  the  residual  strains  increase  with  increasing  load.  Figure  4.15  shows  how  temperature  affects  the  loadingunloading and reloading. The residual stress upon unloading is seen to have increased  with  temperature.  Moreover,  since  the  applied  stress  is  within  the  linear  range  i.e.  0.3r,  the  maximum strain level is attained upon reloading the specimen.

Conclusion 

A  micromechanical  model,  based  on  the  assumptions  of  the  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  (SUCM)  model  is  utilized  to  predict  the  thermomechanical  viscoelastic  response  of  a  high  temperature  polymer  matrix  composite  system  made  up  of  T65035  graphite  fibers  embedded  in  PMR15  within  a  temperature  range  of  250  to  300o  C,  corresponding  to  military  aerospace  engine  applications.  Current  works  on  modeling  temperature  dependent  viscoelastic  behavior  of  polymer  matrix  composites  are  mainly  based  on  the  assumption  of  thermorheologically  simple  material.  However,  through  the  present  approach, the matrix is modeled as a thermorheologically complex material.   The  results  are  found  to  be  in  good  agreement  with  the  existing  experimental  data.  The  stressstrain  response  of  the  composite  material  under  a  monotonically  increasing  stress  is  seen  to  be  affected  by  temperature  in  transverse  and  shear  loadings  which  are  dominated  by 

66   

matrix  properties.  When  subject  to  creep  loading,  the  acceleration  of  the  creep  strain  and  softening  of  the  initial  and  timedependent  portions  of  the  composite  response  with  increasing  temperature  are  apparent  in  particular,  for  temperatures  above  275o  C  where  the  change  in  material  response  is  more  noticeable.  Under  cyclic  creep  loading,  the  total  strain  is  seen  to  increase  due  to  the  accumulation  of  creep  strain  during  each  cycle  although  the  rate  of this increase drops from cycle to cycle as the number of the cycles increases. In general, the  effect  of  temperature  is  observed  to  be  more  pronounced  for  temperatures  higher  than  275o  C. For instance, in case of cyclic loading, the rate of the strain change between 250o C and 275o  C  i.e.  within  the  second  half  of  each  cycle  is  much  less  compared  to  the  first  half.  Through  modeling  the  polymer  resin  as  a  thermorheologically  complex  material,  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the  elastic  and  viscoelastic  of  the  composite  system  can  be  individually  investigated,  which  clearly  demonstrates  the  importance  of  the  timedependent  viscoelastic  portion of the material response as the temperature increases.

CHAPTER 5: A MICROMECHANICAL APPROACH FOR THE PREDICTION  OF THE TIMEDEPENDENT FAILURE OF HIGH TEMPAERATURE  POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES 
In  this  chapter,  the  micromechanical  approach  is  utilized  to  study  the  time  dependent  failure  of  unidirectional  polymer  matrix  composites.  Research  studies  conducted  so  far  on  the  creep  failure  of  polymer  matrix  composites  are  mainly  based  on  macromechanics  which  predict  the  failure  of  composite  as  a  bulk  material.  However,  matrix  time  dependent  failure  due  to  creep  is  a  localized  phenomenon  which  demands  a  sufficiently  accurate  stress  analysis  of  a  representative  volume  elemen,  where  the  composite  cannot  be  treated  as  homogeneous.  That's  why  micromechanical  analysis  gives  a  far  better  insight  into  the  failure  mechanisms  of  the  composite  materials.  In  fact,  through  micromechanics,  the  modes  of  failure  in  fiber  and  matrix  can  be  separately  identified  which  helps  modify  the  stiffnesses  of  the  constituents  accordingly.  Furthermore,  since  at  high  temperatures,  the  general  behavior  of  the  polymer  matrix  composite  is  governed  by  matrix  viscoelasticity,  the  need  for  micromechanical  analysis  becomes  more  crucial.  The  creep  failure  criterion  is  expressed  in  terms  of  the  creep  failure  functions  of  the  viscoelastic  matrix  material  assuming  that  the  creep  failure  of  the  composite  material  is  only  due  to  the  failure  of  the  epoxy  matrix.    The  main  advantage  of  the  present  method  is  that  it  makes  use  of  the  micromechanical  model  to  obtain  the  creep  failure  functions  of  the  matrix  material  from  the  knowledge  of  the  creep  behavior  of  the  bulk  composite material in only transverse and shear loadings.  Upon the calculation of  these creep  functions, the creep failure behavior of the composite for any offaxis degree can be predicted  without  the  need  for  carrying  out  any  experiments,  which  is  of  great  benefit  particularly  at  high  temperatures  where  experimentation  poses  a  lot  of  challenges.  The  composite  material 
68   

used  in  the  study  is  T300/934  which  is  suitable  for  service  at  high  temperatures  in  aerospace  applications. 

5.1

Composite Creep Failure 

Unlike  macromechanics  where  failure  is  controlled  by  the  properties  of  the  bulk  composite  material,  the  micromechanical  modeling  of  a  composite  material  makes  it  possible  to  investigate the failure modes of the constituent materials separately. However, in many cases,  the  ultimate  strengths  of  the  fiber  and  matrix  constituents  are  not  readily  available or  are  not  always  given  by  those  measured  from  the  bulk  fiber  or  matrix  materials.  For  instance,  in  the  case  of  a  weak  interface  between  fiber  and  matrix,  the  ultimate  strengths  of  the  matrix  need  to  be  modified  in  order  to  account  for  those  weaker  interfaces.  Based  on  the  concept  explained in section 3.5, the creep strengths of the matrix material can be calculated from the  knowledge  of  the  creep  strength  of  the  composite  material  in  transverse  and  shear  loadings  by calculating max(k22) and  max(k12) , respectively.   Once  these  creep  strengths  are  determined,  the  creep  life  of  the  unidirectional  composite  material  at  any  offaxis  degree  can  be  obtained  from  testing  of  the  composite  in  only  transverse  and  shear  loading  which  eliminates  the  need  for  any  further  experimentation.  The  creep failure criterion for the unidirectional composite is thus expressed as follows: 
  ( k ) 22    ( k )12        1 Y S      mcreep   mcreep 
2 2

(5.1)

where   k  =II,  III,  IV,  i.e.  the  matrix  subcells.  Unlike  the  static  loading,  Ymcreep  and  Smcreep  are  the  creep  failure  strengths  of  the  matrix  material  which  are  functions  of  time  and  temperature.  The  failure  is  assumed  to  have  occurred  once  one  the  subcells  fails  the  forgoing  criterion.  The 
69   

major  assumption  of  the  present  approach  is  that  creep  failure  of  the  composite  material  is  only due to the failure of the polymer matrix.

Long Term Behavior of T300/934 Composite Systems 

One  of  the  most  important  applications  of  composite  materials  in  general,  and  high  temperature  PMC's  in  particular,  is  in  the  aerospace  industry.  Nowhere  else,  is  there  such  a  critical  need  for  high  performance  of  light  weight  material  under  severe  conditions.  T300/934  is  one  of  the  polymer  matrix  composite  materials  suitable  for  service  at  high  temperatures  in  aerospace applications. In fact, this graphite epoxy fiber reinforced composite system is one of  the  few  designated  as  "spaceapproved"  by  NASA.  These  fibers  are  produced  by  carbonizing  high  modulus  organic  precursors  (PolyAcrylonitrile,  PAN)  at  high  temperatures  in  an  inert  atmosphere. The epoxy resin is a thermosetting polymer binder that cures at 3500 F. Table 5.1  shows the material properties of the fiber and matrix materials for this composite system.

Hiel  et  al.  (1983)  conducted  creep  tests  on  100  offaxis  T300/934  composites  under  shear  loading  at  four  different  temperatures:  119  o  C,  148  o  C,  160  o  C  and  168  o  C.  The  average  fiber  volume  fraction  of  the  coupon  tests  was  60%.  Shear  compliance  master  curve  was  created  using the timestresssuperposition principal (TSSP) with the reference temperature of 119 o C.  At  each  temperature,  the  experimental  creep  data  was  reported  for  different  stress  levels  ranging  from  1  to  5  ksi.   Based  on  this  data,  the  temperature  shift  factor  a(T)  is  calibrated  as  follows:

The  coefficients  of  the  sixterm  prony  series  n,  as  well  as  the  nonlinear  coefficients  of  the  Schapery  equation  i.e.  g0,  g1,  g2  and  a  are  taken  from  HajAli  (2004).  The  SUCM  is  then  employed  to  predict  the  creep  strain  of  the  composite  for  different  stress  levels  for  the  reference  temperature  for  160  o  C.  This  particular  temperature  was  chosen  since  the  creep  failure  of  the  composite  material  is  investigated  and  compared  with  the  experimental  data  at  this  temperature.  Figure  5.1  shows  the  creep  compliance  of  the  material  at  T=  160  o  C.   Good  agreement is seen between the micromechanical model predictions and experimental results.

Creep Failure of T300/934 Composites 

Figure 5.2 shows the creep failure time for different levels of stress of unidirectional T300/934  laminates  in  transverse  and  shear  loading  at  T=160o  C,  obtained  by  Dillard  (1981).  The  micromechanical  model  uses  this  data  as  global  loads  to  obtain  the  creep  failure  strengths  of  the  matrix material  as  local  stresses  in  the matrix  subcells as  functions  of  time.  Using  the  data

The above acquired functions are used in the creep failure criterion of Equation 5.1 which can  then  be  used  to  find  the  creep  failure  time  for  any  arbitrary  offaxis  angle.  Figures  5.35.6  show  the  creep  rupture  predictions  for  different  offaxis  unidirectional  laminates  compared  with  the  experimental  results  obtained  by  Brinson  et.  al  (1981).  As  can  be  seen,  there  is  reasonable  agreement  between  experiment  and  predictions  considering  the  inherent  scatter  associated with composite testing.

The Effect of Temperature on the Creep Failure 

In  this  section,  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the  creep  failure  of  T300/934  composites  is  studied  through  the  present  approach.  The  micromechanical  model  is  used  to  obtain  the 

74   

creep  failure  strength  of  the  matrix  material  in  the  transverse  direction,  i.e.  Ymcreep  from  the  experimental results by Brinson et al (1981) at 193o C as follows: 

Ymcreep  16.64273  1.86415exp(t / 71.42584)  2.58483exp(t / 2103.728)  2.0662 exp(t / 4.83319)

 

(5.5)

However,  in  the  absence  of  any  reliable  information  on  the  creep  behavior  of  the  composite  material  in  shear  loading  at  this  temperature,  the  same creep  failure  function  is  used  for  both  shear  and  transverse  directions  i.e.  Ymcreep=Smcreep.  Figures  5.7  and  5.8  respectively,  show  the  creep  failure  responses  of  the  600  and  the  450  unidirectional  composite  at  two  different  temperatures.  The  disagreement  between  the  present  results  and  the  experiments  for  the  higher  temperature  may  be  attributed  to  the  foregoing  assumption  of  considering  the  same  creep  failure  function  for  both  transverse  and  shear  loading.  Nevertheless,  increasing  temperature is seen to have reduced the creep strength of the material drastically for both off  axis angles where the behavior of the material is more matrix dominant.

Conclusion 

A  novel  approach  is  introduced  to  study  the  time  delayed  failure  of  unidirectional  polymer  matrix  composites  through  a  simplified  unit  cell  micromechanical  model.  The  creep  failure  criterion is expressed in terms of the creep failure strengths of the viscoelastic matrix material  in  transverse  and  shear  loadings,  which  are  functions  of  time  and  temperature.  The  micromechanical  model  is  also  used  to  calculate  these  creep  failure  functions  from  the  knowledge of the creep behavior of the composite material in principal directions. As a result,  the  creep  life  of  the  unidirectional  composite  material  at  any  offaxis  degree  can  be  obtained  from testing of the composite in only transverse and shear loading, which eliminates the need  for  any  further  experimentation.  The  results  obtained  are  seen  to  be  in  agreement  with  the  experimental  data  in  the  literature  for  different  offaxis  degrees.  The  creep  strength  of  the  material  is  seen  to  have  decreased  with  increasing  temperature  in  for  both  600  and  450 

76   

laminates  where  the  polymer  matrix  plays  an  important  role  in  the  general  response  of  the  composite material.

CHAPTER 6: THE ROLE OF VISCOELASTICITY ON THE FATIGUE OF  ANGLEPLY POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES AT HIGH AND ROOM  TEMPERATURES 
In  this  chapter,  the  micromechanical  model  is  modified  to  study  the  role  of  viscoelasticity  on  the  fatigue  behavior  of  polymer  matrix  composites.  In  particular,  the  study  examines  the  interaction  of  fatigue  and  creep  in  angle  ply  carbon/epoxy  at  25o  C  and  114o  C.  The  matrix  phase  is  modeled  as  a  vicoelastic  material  using  Schapery's  single  integral  constitutive  equation.  Taking  viscoelsticity  into  account  allows  the  study  of  creep  strain  evolution  during  the  fatigue  loading.  The  fatigue  failure  criterion  is  expressed  in  terms  of  the  fatigue  failure  functions  of  the  constituent  materials.  The  main  goal  of  this  chapter  is  to  study  the  fatigue  failure  of  angleply  polymer  matrix  composites  including  the  hereditary  effect  of  the  matrix  material  which  can  thus  study  effects  of  staticfatigue  (creep)  and  dynamic  degradation  of  is  strength due to the applied cyclic loading, separately both at room and high temperatures. 

6.1

Interaction of Creep and Fatigue 

In  fatigue  loading  of  polymer  matrix  composites,  the  mean  stress  can  be  regarded  as  a  static  load under which the material creeps. Based on this assumption the mean strain developed in  the material under fatigue loading may be written as  

   cyclic   creep  

  (6.1)

where creep is the portion of the strain accumulated in the material due to the viscoelasticity  of  the  polymer  matrix.  cyclic  denotes  the  portion  of  the  strain  development  due  to  cyclic  or  fatigue  damage.  Both  these  portions  are  functions  of  temperature,  time  and  the  mean  stress.  A comprehensive fatigue model should therefore be able to account for both of these portions 

78   

of  strain  development.   The  fatigue  failure  criterion  used  in  this  work  expresses  the  failure  of  matrix  and  fiber  constituents  in  terms  of  the  average  stresses  of  the  fiber  and  matrix  subcells  as follows: 
 ( I )11
Xf

1

(6.2a)   

 ( k ) 12   ( k ) 22   1     Sm   Xm   

2

2

(6.2b) 

In  the  abovementioned  equation,  k  =II,  III,  IV  refer  to  various  matrix  subcells.  The  stresses  in  the  fiber  and  matrix  subcells  are  obtained  using  the  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  model.  This  enables  the  direct  consideration  of  the  effect  of  viscoelasticity  of  the  matrix  material in calculating the local stresses (k)22 and (k)12 . Unlike the static loading Xm, Xf and Sm  are  the  fatigue  failure  functions  of  the  constituent  materials  which  depend  on  stress  amplitude R, frequency, temperature and the number of cycles. The failure is assumed to have  occurred  once  one  of  the  subcells  fails  the  forgoing  criterion.  The  present  methodology  is  capable  of  calculating  the  contribution  to  the  total  strain  development,  made  by  fatigue  damage  and  viscoelasticity,  i.e.  both  terms  on  the  righthand  side  of  Equation  6.1,  separately.  In order to  model stiffness degradation due to  cycling, the model developed by Ramakrishnan  and Jayaraman (1993) is utilized as follows assuming that the bulk of stiffness degradation and  subsequently the damage happen in the matrix material: 
E V E 1  m m Ec   Ec    (1  f ) ln( N  1)  f N   ln( N f ) Nf     

(6.3)

 

79   

In Equation 6.3, Ec denotes the composite stiffness. The terms Vm and Em correspond to matrix  volume  fraction  and  modulus,  respectively  and  Nf  indicates  the  number  of  cycles  to  failure  of  the composite material. f is a factor accounting for fibermatrix interface strength which varies  between  0  (poor  fibermatrix  interface)  and  1  (perfectly  bonded  fiber  matrix  interface).  The  assumption  that  damage  is  mainly  due  to  stiffness  degradation  in  the  matrix  material  holds  true  for  higher  fiber  angles  when  the  behavior  of  the  material  is  matrix  dominated.  The  problem  however,  is  that  Equation  6.3  needs  the  fatigue  life  of  the  material,  Nf,  as  an  input  whereas  finding  Nf  is  one  of  the  objectives  in  the  present  approach.  In  order  to  alleviate  this  problem, a convergence algorithm as shown in figure 6.1 is incorporated into the formulation.  An educated guess for Nf which could ensure convergence after only a few iterations would be  obtained  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  stiffness  degradation  of  the  matrix  material  is  mainly  due  to  loading  in  the  transverse  direction  in  other  words,  mode  I  of  fracture.  For  an  angle  ply  lamina  subjected  to  a  general  state  of  loading  in  the  global  coordinate  system  x,  y  and  xy,  the  stress  components  in  the  lamina  coordinate  system  are  found  through  the  stress  transformation matrix [T1] (Agarwal et al., 2006): 
 x   L       T   T1  y       LT   xy   

    (6.4)

Once T is obtained from Equation 16, its corresponding Nf  i.e. the number of cycles to failure  can be calculated from the SN curve of the composite material in transverse direction, which  serves as the first guess to be input into the convergence algorithm of figure 6 .1.

Creep Behavior of Unidirectional EGlass/Epoxy 

To  demonstrate  the  capability  of  the  present  micromechanical  approach  to  account  for  the  viscoelasticity  of  polymer  matrix  composites,  the  SUCM  model  is  first  validated  through  comparison with creep test results for Eglass/epoxy off ­axis composites reported by Lou and  Schapery  (1971).  The  material  properties  of  composite  constituents  and  the  Prony  series  coefficients for the epoxy matrix are tabulated in Tables 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.

Figures  6.2  and  6.3  show  the  creep  responses  for  the  600  and  the  900  offaxis  specimens,  respectively.  The  results  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  data  which  thus  validate  the  present  viscoelastic  formulation.  In  both  cases,  the  acceleration  of  the  creep  strain  and  softening  of  the  initial  and  timedependent  portions  of  the  composite  response  increases with increasing stress. In particular, as can be seen in figure 6.2, the material exhibits  nonlinear behavior for the highest stress value i.e. gi's in Schapery's are greater than unity.

Fatigue behavior of unidirectional EGlass/Epoxy  

Unidirectional Eglass/epoxy offaxis composite specimens with a fiber volume fraction of 60%  were tested for fatigue failure up to 106 cycles at the frequency of 19 cps by Hashin and Rotem 
83   

(1973).  The  stress  ratio  of  all  the  tests  was  0.1.  In  this  section  the  SUCM  model  is  utilized  to  predict  the  fatigue  failure  of  unidirectional  Eglass/epoxy  composites  in  offaxis  loading  including  the  effect  viscoelasticity.  Figures  6.4  and  6.5  depict  the  SN  diagrams  of  the  composite  material  in  principal  directions.  As  previously  mentioned,  these  data  are  then  used  to  generate  fatigue  strengths  of  the  composite  constituents  as  a  function  of  the  number  of  cycles for the specified frequency and stress ratio using the micromechanical model, which are  input into the fatigue failure criterion of Equation 6.2.

Figures  6.66.8  show  a  comparison  between  the  results  of  the  present  study  with  the  literature.  The  results  are  seen  to  be  in  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  data.  As  expected,  the  results  show  the  degradation  of  strength  with  the  number  of  cycles.  In  concurrence  with  the  experimental  observations  reported  in  the  reference,  two  modes  of  failure were found to be dominant in determining the fatigue life of the composite specimens:  fiber  fracture  and  matrix  cracking.  The  micromechanical  approach  as  opposed  to  the  macromechanics can distinguish between these two failure modes.

Including  viscoelasticity  in  the  constitutive  relation  of  the  matrix  material  enables  the  present  model  to  calculate  the  strain  creep  which  is  the  result  of  creep  in  the  material  under  the  fatigue  mean  stress.   This  is  in  fact  the  difference  between  the  fatigue  mean  strains  with  and  without  including  the  viscoelasticity  in  the  formulation.  Since  the  mean  strain  is  on  the  rise  during  fatigue,  max(creep)  takes  place  at  the  end  of  the  fatigue  life  of  the  material.  This  is  schematically  shown  in  figure  6.9.  Figure  6.10  shows  the  maximum  viscoelastic  strain  developed  corresponding  to  different  stress  levels  for  the  600  composite  offaxis  laminate.  It  can be seen that increasing the mean stress reduces the viscoelastic strain accumulation in the  material. The fact is that although viscoelasticity is more pronounced at higher stress levels, its  contribution  to  strain  development  during  fatigue  is  compromised  by  the  shorter  life  of  the  specimen  when  compared  to  lower  stresses. This  accumulation  of  viscoelastic  strain  during  fatigue  loading  accelerates  the  failure  of  the  material.  This  is  apparent  in  figure  6.11  which  shows  the  SN  curve  for  the  600  offaxis  specimen  with  and  without  viscoelasticity.  In  fact,  as 

87   

the offaxis angle increases, the behavior of the material becomes more matrix dominated and  the present method taking the viscoelasticity of the matrix material into account, yields better  results.  However,  the  importance  of  viscoelasticity  in  predicting  the  fatigue  life  of  polymer  matrix composite materials is expected to be more pronounced at elevated temperatures.

Creep Response of T300/5208 

The material selected for this study is a graphite/epoxy composite made up of T300 fibers and  5208  epoxy  with  65%  volume  fraction  which  has  extensive  applications  in  the  aerospace  industry.  The  time  temperature  shift  factor  of  5208  epoxy  resin  has  been  extracted  from  thermomechanical and electrical conductivity measurements by Kibler and Carter (1978). The  elastic  properties  of  the  composite  materials  and  the  Prony  series  coefficients  calibrated  for  the  linear  viscoleastic  response  of  the  matrix  material  are  tabulated  in  Tables  6.3  and  6.4,  respectively.  The  nonlinear  coefficients  g0,  g1  and  g2  were  taken  from  the  reference  (HajAli  and Muliana, 2004a).

Tuttle  and  Brinson  (1986)  subjected  100  and  900  offaxis  unidirectional  T300/5208  specimens  to  creep  tests  for  480  min  at  different  stress  levels.  These  tests  were  performed  at  room  temperature.  Figures  6.12  and  6.13  show  the  transverse  and  shear  creep  strains  of  the  unidirectional composite. Goodtoreasonable agreement with the experimental results shows  that  the  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  (SUCM)  model  is  capable  of  predicting  the  viscoelastic  response  of  the  T300/5208  composite.  Figure  6.14  shows  the  transverse  creep  response  of  T300/5208  at  25o  C  and  114o  C.  The  results  for  the  high  temperature  were  obtained  by  changing  the  shift  factor  based  on  its  temperature  dependence  determined  by  Kibler and Carter (1978). It can be seen that increasing temperature gives rise to the softening  of  the  material  resulting  in  higher  strains  in  both  the  initial  and  timedependent  portions  of  the  composite  response.  This  increase  is  of  course  more  prominent  for  higher  stress  levels  when the matrix material enters the nonlinear viscoelastic range.

Fatigue Behavior of AnglePly T300/5208 

Tensiontension  fatigue  tests  on  unidirectional,  angleply  and  symmetrically  balanced  laminates  at  different  temperatures  were  carried  out  by  Rotem  and  Nelson  at  a  frequency  of  10 cps (Rotem and Nelson, 1978). The stress ratio of all tests was 0.1. In this section the SUCM  model  is  utilized  to  predict  the  fatigue  failure  of  [±75]2s  T300/5208  composites  including  the  effect  of  viscoelasticity  and  damage  accumulation  of  the  matrix  material.  Figure  6.15  depicts  the  SN  diagrams  of  the  composite  material  in  principal  directions  at  25o  C  and  114o  C.  As  previously  mentioned,  these  data  are  then  used  to  generate  fatigue  strengths  of  the  composite  constituents  as  a  function  of  the  number  of  cycles  for  the  specified  frequency  and  stress  ratio  using  the  micromechanical  model,  and  are  then  input  into  the  fatigue  failure  criterion  of  Equation  6.2.  It  can  be  seen  that  while  the  longitudinal  and  shear  strengths  of  the  composite  material  remain  unchanged  with  temperature,  the  transverse  strength  decreases  with increasing temperature making the material more susceptible to failure.

Figures  6.16  and  6.17  show  the  SN  curves  of  [±75]2s  angleply  laminate  compared  to  the  experimental  data  reported  in  the  literature.  The  results  are  seen  to  be  in  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  data.  As  expected,  the  results  show  the  degradation  of  strength  with  the  number  of  cycles.  In  concurrence  with  the  experimental  observations  reported  in  the  reference,  two  modes  of  failure  were  found  to  be  dominant  in  determining  the  fatigue  life  of  the  composite  specimens:  fiber  fracture  and  matrix  cracking.  The  micromechanical  approach  as opposed to the macromechanics can distinguish between these two failure modes.

Creep Fatigue Interaction 

Now  that  the  fatigue  life  of  the  composite  material  has  been  estimated,  the  present  methodology can be utilized to calculate each term on the right hand side of Equation 6.1, i.e. 
94   

cyclic  and  creep.  Eliminating  viscoelasticity  from  the  formulation  will  cause  the  strain  development to be the result of fatigue damage. Similarly, if the formulation excludes strength  degradation  due  to  fatigue,  the  resulting  strain  development  will  be  due  to  creep  or  viscoelasticity  of  the  matrix  material.  Figure  6.18  shows  the  transverse  mean  strain  development  due  to  fatigue  and  creep,  separately.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  share  of  viscoelasticity is dominant throughout most of the life of the specimen. However, towards the  end  of  the  life,  it  is  the  stiffness  degradation  due  to  fatigue  damage  that  prevails  in  the  evolution of damage.  

 
Figure 618: Transverse mean strain development due to fatigue and creep 

Figure  6.19  depicts  the  contribution  made  by  the  effect  of  viscoelasticity  to  the  total  strain  evolution  during  the  fatigue  life  of  the  specimen  under  the  same  loading  conditions  at  two  different  temperatures.  The  distance  between  the  curves  can  be  regarded  as  a  metric  for  measuring  the  contribution  made  by  viscoelastity  to  the  overall  damage  evolution  in  the 

95   

material.  A  closer  observation  of  the  figure  shows  that  for  the  lower  temperature  i.e.  25o  C,  the development of fatigue mean strain is mainly dominated by creep. Meanwhile the damage  evolution  for  the  higher  temperature  is  governed  more  by  the  first  term  of  Equation  6.1.  This  is an interesting finding in the sense that although viscoelasticity is more pronounced at higher  temperature,  its  contribution  to  strain  development  during  fatigue  is  compromised  by  the  shorter life of the specimen when compared to lower temperatures. The effect of mean stress  on the contribution of viscoelasticity to the total strain development is shown in figure 6.20.  It  is  clear  that  for  the  higher  mean  stress,  although  the  creep  strain  rises,  the  total  mean  strain  development  is  dominated  by  stiffness  degradation  due  to  cycling  i.e.  the  first  term  of  the  righthand side of Equation 13. This is similar to the effect of high temperature shown in figure  10.  In  other  words,  the  higher  mean  stress  expedites  the  failure  of  the  material  mainly  through cycling as compared to viscoelasticity.

Conclusion 

The  fatigue  life  of  angle­ply  Glass/epoxy  and  Graphite/epoxy  laminates  was  calculated  through  a  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  approach  including  the  effect  of  damage  and  viscoelasticity  at  two  different  temperatures.  The  agreement  between  experiment  and  prediction  appears  to  be  reasonable.  The  contributions  made  by  viscoelasticity  and  cycling  to  material  softening  were  individually  investigated.  Effect  of  viscoelasticity  was  taken  into  account  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  fatigue  mean  stress  acts  like  constant  load  which  causes  creep  in  the  material.  It  was  observed  that  the  share  of  viscoelasticity  is  more  significant  throughout  most  of  the  life  of  the  specimen.  However,  towards  the  end  of  the  life,  stiffness degradation plays a more dominant role in the evolution of damage. It was also found  that  in  spite  of  the  increase  in  creep  strain  at  higher  temperatures;  its  contribution  to  strain  development  during  fatigue  loading  is  compromised  by  the  shorter  life  of  the  specimen  when  compared  to  lower  temperatures.  Regarding  the  effect  of  mean  stress,  one  could  see  that 
97   

higher mean stress expedites the failure of the material mainly through cycling as compared to  viscoelasticity.

CHAPTER 7: A CASESTUDY ON THE CREEP AND FATIGUE OF HIGH  TEMPERATURE RP46 POLYIMIDE COMPOSITE 
The  present  study  utilizes  a  micromechanical  model  based  on  the  assumptions  of  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  (SUCM)  model  to  study  the  viscoelastic  response  of  AS412K  /RP46  composites  within  a  temperature  range  of  180  to  270  o  C.  It  is  assumed  that  within  this  short  period  of  time,  the  effect  of  chemical  aging  can  be  neglected.    Since  in  a  micromechanical  approach,  the  matrix and  the  fibers  have  to  be  modeled  separately,  the  first  part  of  this  study  is dedicated to the viscoelastic characterizing of RP46 polyimide resin to be used as the matrix  phase  of  the  composite  material.  In  the  present  approach,  upon  the  characterization  of  the  matrix material, the obtained properties are input to the Simplified Unit Cell Micromechanical  model to study the creep and fatigue behavior of the composite.

RP46 Polyimide Resin 

RP46  is  a  high  temperature  polyimide  composite  resin  created  by  NASA  as  an  alternative  for  the  existing  polyimide  systems.  This  high  temperature  resin  has  been  specifically  developed  for  aerospace  applications.  The  operating  temperature  of  RP46  ranges  from 101    to  357  o  C.  Another  quality  of  RP46  is  its  lower  moisture  absorption  which  makes  it  less  vulnerable  to  moisture  induced  damage.  RP46  also  possesses  excellent  thermal  oxidative  stability  and  resistance to microcracking.

Viscoelastic Characterization of RP46 Neat Resin 

Figure  7.1  shows  a  sketch  of  the  RP46  sample  used  for  tensile  and  creep  tests.  The  sample  is  cut  by  water  jet  from  a  12.7  cm  by  3.81  cm  plate  with  a  thickness  of  0.254  cm.  The  plate  was  manufactured by compression molding for 2 hours at 137.9 bar and 325 o C.

7.2.1

Experimental setup 

Temperatures  for  the  tests  to  characterize  the  viscoelastic  behavior  of  RP46  were  chosen  to  be 180, 220 and 270 o C to simulate service conditions which are typically below the material's  glass  transition  temperatures.  The  static  and  creep  tests  were  performed  in  accordance  with  the ASTM D3039M  08 and D2990 ­ 09, respectively. The experiments were performed under  uniaxial  tension  using  a  servohydraulic  MTS  machine  equipped  with  a  100  kN  load  cell.  The testing  machine  was  also  equipped  with  a  crosshead  displacement  sensor  (LVDT).  The  samples  were  heated  in  a  closed  type  cylindrical  shell  furnace,  ATS  model  3210.  In  order  to  maintain  the  temperature  and  prevent  heat  loss,  insulation  was  put  between  the  furnace  and  the grip. Figure 7.2 shows the furnace with a mounted sample inside it.

7.2.2

Tension and creep tests 

Tension tests were performed at the aforementioned three temperatures 180, 220 and 270 o C  at a loading rate of 2mm/min. The peak stress measured in the tensile tests was considered to  be the ultimate strength (UTS) of the material at that very temperature. Both the modulus and  ultimate strength were seen to decrease with temperature indicating that the epoxy becomes  more  ductile  as  we  get  closer  to  Tg.  Once  the  ultimate  strength  of  the  material  was  determined,  creep  tests  were  conducted  at  20%  of  the  UTS  for  each  temperature  to  ensure  linear viscoelasticity.  After loading the sample to the target stress, it was allowed to creep for  30 minutes. The results from the creep test for different temperatures are shown in figure 7.3.  It  is  noted  that  the  instantaneous  compliance  of  the  material  is  increasing  with  increasing  temperature.

7.2.3

Prony Series representation of the creep data 

The obtained creep data is used to determine the Prony series for RP46 through the use of the  TimeTemperature  Superposition  Principle  (TTSP)  assuming  that  material  behavior  is  linearly  viscoelastic  at  20%  of  the  UTS.  According  to  TTSP,  the  viscoelastic  behavior  at  one  temperature  can  be  related  to  that  of  another  temperature  by  a  change  in  time  scale.  The  Prony series representation of the compliance is: 
D(t )  D0   Di (1  exp(i t ))
i 1 N

(7.1)  

Where  D(t)  is  the  compliance  at  time  t,  and  D0  is  the  elastic  compliance.  Di  and  i  are  the  magnitudes  of  compliance  and  reciprocal  of  the  retardation  times,  respectively  which  correspond to the ith KelvinVoigt element and N is the total number of elements to represent  material behavior. In order to create the master curve, the compliance data at 220 o C and 270 
o 

C is shifted horizontally on a log scale to the reference temperature of 180 o C so as to form a 

102   

continuous  curve.   Figure  7.4  shows  the  master  curve  obtained  through  this  procedure  along  with  the  value  of  the  horizontal  shift  factor.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  master  curve  can  provide  creep compliance predictions up to 88 hours at the reference temperature. The next step is to  fit  the  Prony  series  representation  of  the  compliance  to  the  obtained  master  curve.  The  problem  of  curve  fitting  of  Equation  6.1  is  one  of  a  nonlinear  optimization.   The  master  curve  in  figure  7.5  has  been  fitted  to  a  5  term  Prony  series  using  commercial  curve  fitting  software,  Origin  8.5.  As  shown  in  figure  7.5,  a  reasonable  fit  has  been  obtained  to  the  experimentally  generated master curve. The Prony series coefficients are listed in Table 7.1.

Composite Laminate Creep Response 

The  composite  Laminates  were  prepared  by  the  hand  layup  technique  using  8  layers  of  AS4 12K  unidirectional  fiber  and  the  RP46  resin  with  0  degree  orientation.  Specimen  dimensions  were 200 mm × 20 mm × 3 mm. A scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM6380) was used to  calculate  the  volume  fraction  of  the  constituents.  The  average  volume  fraction  of  fiber  was  found to be approximately 37%. The same curing cycle as the one for neat resin was also used  for the composite. The composite specimens were first subjected to static tension tests at 180  and  270  o  C  in  the  transverse  direction  in  order  to  determine  the  ultimate  tensile  strength. 

104   

Next,  the  samples  were  subjected  to  30  minute  creep  tests  at  30%  and  60%  of  the  UTS  for  each temperature. The vicoelastic properties of the neat resin obtained in the previous section  (Table  7.1)  were  incorporated  into  the  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  (SUCM)  model  to  predict the creep response of the RP46 resin based composite system. Based on the neat resin  characterization, since 180 o C is the reference temperature, f1(T), f2(T) and aT(T) (Equation 4.5)  are  all  equal  to  unity.  When  the  creep  load  is  30%  of  the  UTS,  the  material  has  been  considered to be linearly viscoelastic i.e. g0()=g1 ()=g2()=a()=1. Figure 7.6 shows the creep  response  of  the  composite  material  at  180o  C  for  30%  of  the  UTS  compared  to  the  experimental  results.    At  the  creep  load  of  60%  of  the  UTS,  the  material  behavior  becomes  nonlinear  viscoelastic.  In  order  to  include  the  nonlinearity  of  the  material,  only  g2()  and  a()  are taken to be equal to 1. Now, assuming that plastic strain is negligible, g0() can be found as  the  ratio  of  the  instantaneous  creep  response  to  that  of  linear  elastic  material  i.e.  at  30%  of  the  UTS,  while  g1()   is  obtained  by  fitting  Schapery  constitutive  Equation  to  the  experimental  creep  curve.  Figure  7.7  compares  the  creep  response  of  the  material  at  180  o  C  for  60%  of  the  UTS  with  the  experimental  data  before  and  after  including  nonlinearity.  It  can  be  seen  that  increasing  the  creep  load  gives  rise  to  the  softening  of  the  material  and  consequently  the  creep strain.

The  creep  response  of  the  composite  material  at  270  o  C  for  30%  of  the  UTS  in  comparison  with  the  experiment  is  depicted  in  Figure  7.8.  The  effect  of  temperature  has  been  taken  into  account through the shift factor aT(T) as well as f1(T). The temperature increase is seen to have  caused  the  acceleration  of  the  creep  strain  and  softening  of  both  the  initial  and  time
106   

dependent  portions  of  the  composite  response.  For  60%  of  the  UTS  at  270  o  C,  g0()  and  g1()  are  obtained  in  a  similar  fashion  as  for  the  previous  temperature.  Figure  7.9  shows  the  creep  response  both  before  and  after  including  nonlinearity.  A  closer  look  at  Figures  7.7  and  7.9  shows that the effect of nonlinearity is more pronounced at T=270 o C.

Effect of Viscoelasticity on the fatigue of Composite Laminate  

The  fatigue  tests  on  AS412K  /RP46  composites  were  conducted  at  180  and  270  o  C  in  the  same  experimental  setup  shown  in  figure  7.2.  The  frequency  of  the  tests  was  5  cps  and  the  stress  ratio was  fixed  to  be  0.15.  Figures  7.10  and  7.11  show  the  mean  strain  evolution  during  the  fatigue  loading  of  the  composite  at  180  o  C  for  40%  and  60%  of  the  ultimate  strength,  respectively.  Similar  to  the  observation  in  the  previous  chapter,  it  can  be  seen  for  the  lower  stress  level  that  the  contribution  of  viscoelasticity  to  the  strain  development  is  more.  As  shown  in  figure  7.10,  the  strain  evolution  during  the  first  80%  of  the  life  of  the  specimen  is  dominated by creep. This is compared to the 65% of the life for the higher stress level in figure  7.11.  Figure  7.12  show  the  mean  strain  evolution  at  270  o  C  for  40%  of  the  UTS.  A  comparison  between  figure  7.12  and  7.10  show  that  although  increasing  the  temperature  accelerates  the  evolution  of  viscoelastic  strain,  the  role  viscoelasticity  is  less  prominent.  In  other  words,  after 

108   

only  a  small  portion  of  the  total  life,  total  strain  evolution  will  be  mainly  due  to  the  cyclic  effect of fatigue loading.

Conclusion 

Creep tests were carried out on RP46 Polyimide resin at three different temperatures 180, 220  and  270  o  C.  The  instantaneous  compliance  of  the  material  was  seen  to  be  increasing  with  increasing  temperature.  A  creep  master  curve  was  created  by  horizontally  shifting  the  compliance  data  to  the  reference  temperature  of  180  o  C  vs.  log  (time).  While  the  duration  of  each  creep  test  was  30  minutes,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  master  curve  can  provide  creep  compliance predictions for up to 88 hours at the reference temperature. A 5term Prony series  was  fit  to  the  master curve.  The  acquired  viscoelatic  properties  were  then  incorporated  into  a  Simplified  Unit  Cell  Micromechanical  model  to  study  the  creep  response  of  the  RP46  resin  based composite system. The creep tests on the AS412K /RP46 composite revealed two types  of  nonlinearities,  one  due  to  stress  and  the  other  one  due  to  temperature.  Both  these  nonlinearities  can  be  modeled  through  the  use  of  proper  coefficients  in  the  constitutive  equation  of  the  matrix  material.  The  temperature  increase  was  seen  to  have  caused  the 
110   

acceleration  of  the  creep  strain  and  softening  of  both  the  initial  and  timedependent  portions  of  the  composite  response.  It  was  also  observed  that  higher  temperature  gives  rise  to  stress  nonlinearities.  At  higher  the  temperature,  despite  the  increase  in  the  viscoelastic  strain,  the  role of viscoelastity is seen to have decreased compared to the lower temperature.

CHAPTER 8: CONCLUSIONS 
8.1 Conclusions 

The most notable conclusions reached in the present thesis are as follows:   The  assumption  of  thermorheologically  simple  behavior  might  not  capture  the  true  behavior of some polymer matrix materials.   The  stressstrain  response  of  the  composite  material  under  a  monotonically  increasing  stress  was  seen  to  be  affected  by  temperature  in  transverse  and  shear  loadings  which  were dominated by matrix properties. When subject to creep loading, the acceleration  of  the  creep  strain  and  softening  of  the  initial  and  timedependent  portions  of  the  composite  response  with  increasing  temperature  was  noticeable.  Under  cyclic  creep  loading,  the  total  strain  was  seen  to  increase  due  to  the  accumulation  of  creep  strain  during  each  cycle  although  the  rate  of  this  increase  drops  from  cycle  to  cycle  as  the  number of the cycles increases.   It  was  observed  that  throughout  the  fatigue  life  a  polymer  matrix  composite  material,  the  share  of  viscoelasticity  was  more  significant  throughout  most  of  the  life  of  the  specimen.  However,  towards  the  end  of  the  life,  stiffness  degradation  played  a  more  dominant  role  in  the  evolution  of  damage.  It  was  also  found  out  that  in  spite  of  the  increase  in  creep  strain  at  higher  temperatures,  its  contribution  to  strain  development  during  fatigue  loading  was  compromised  by  the  shorter  life  of  the  specimen  when  compared  to  lower  temperatures.  Regarding  the  effect  of  mean  stress,  one  could  see   that  higher  mean  stress  expedites  the  failure  of  the  material  mainly  through  cycling  as  compared to viscoelasticity.

Suggestions for future work 

As  mentioned  previously,  the  present  research  attempted  to  fill  the  gap  in  the  literature  by  studying  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the  elastic  and  viscoelastic  response  of  polymer  matrix  composites,  and  proposing  a  methodology  to  investigate  the  role  of  viscoelasticity  on  the  fatigue failure of polymer matrix composite materials at room and high temperatures through  a  micromechanical  approach.  What  has  been  done  in  this  thesis  and  the  methodology  presented  is  in  fact,  a  stepping  stone  towards  the  application  of  high  temperature  polymer  matrix  composites  in  different  fields,  especially  the  aerospace  industry.  In  particular,  the  following areas of research need to be explored:   The  present  thesis  introduces  a  micromechanical  approach  to  study  creep  and  the  effect of viscoelasticity on the fatigue life of polymer matrix composites. This approach  does  have  the  potential  to  be  applied  to  different  composite  materials.  In  particular,  the effect of different parameters such as stress ratio and frequency on fatigue of high  temperature  polymer  matrix  materials  including  viscoelasticity  can  be  investigated  using the present approach.    In  the  present  work,  the  fiber  constituent  of  the  composite  was  assumed  to  be  elastic  and  temperature  independent.  One  potential  area  of  research  is  to  study  composite  materials with flax fibers in which the fiber has vicoelastic behavior, too    The  present  work  focused  on  thin  composite  laminates  in  which  delamination  is  not  a  significant  mode  of  failure.  Studying  the  failure  of  thick  composite  laminates  in  which  delamination is a dominant mode of damage can be another area of future work.

The  micromechanical  model  used  in  this  study  is  simplified  one  in  which  the  RVE  consists  of  only  four  subcells.  Expanding  the  RVE  to  include  more  than  4  subcells  and  how it might improve the accuracy of the results would also be valuable.
