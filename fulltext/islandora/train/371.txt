Foreign Direct Investment and the Choice of Environmental Policy

Abstract We use a simple two-country oligopoly model of intra-industry trade to examine the implications of foreign direct investment for the pollution haven hypothesis and environmental policy. Countries which lower environmental standards to be more competitive in world markets generate pollution havens if environmental policy is exogenous. However, if FDI is a viable option as a mode of entry, pro...t-shifting considerations weaken in favour of environmental considerations and FDI recipients tighten environmental policy, reducing incentives to relocate production. Interestingly, when countries are su¢ ciently similar in their environmental awareness, "grey"countries can become greener than originally "green"countries but ...rms in the latter still engage in FDI in the former, in spite of the stricter standard they face, in order to level the playing ...eld. We derive conditions under which FDI-receiving countries have incentives to manipulate their environmental standards to prevent or attract FDI, potentially eliminating or creating pollution havens.

Introduction

As the global economy has become more integrated,  ows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have increased signi...cantly. In 2003, 64,000 multinationals controlled more than 870,000 foreign a¢ liates worldwide (UNCTAD, 2008) and their sales exceeded $18 trillion (compared to world exports of $8 trillion). Cognizant of this trend, policymakers and researchers have focused on the welfare implications of FDI and on identifying economic variables that are instrumental in FDI decisions. Opponents to international trade and investment  ows frequently argue that globalization and the presence of multinationals cause too lax environmental policies and "pollution havens"to emerge (Newell, 2001; Cole et al., 2006). According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH), di¤erences in pollution regulation across countries constitute a significant determinant of trade patterns and FDI/capital  ows as ...rms in highly pollution-intensive industries have incentives to relocate their operations in countries with less stringent environmental standards. In Eskeland and Harrison (2003), the PHH is best seen as a corollary to the theory of comparative advantage: if it is more costly to conform to more stringent environmental standards at home, pro...t-maximizing ...rms would want to relocate their production activities. As noted in Taylor (2004), a necessary, although not su¢ cient, condition for the PHH is the presence of a "pollution haven e¤ect" which results when a tightening of environmental regulation deters exports (or stimulates imports) of dirty goods. While support for the latter is provided in several empirical studies, the evidence for or against the former (that is, the PHH) is rather limited. Although there exists a growing body of evidence in support of a signi...cant link between the stringency of pollution regulations and the location of foreign direct investment and the size of net trade  ows in U.S. manufacturing industries (List and Co, 2000; Keller and Levinson, 2002; Ederington and Minier, 2003, Levinson and Taylor, 2008), thus suggesting a fairly strong response by ...rms to di¤erences in environmental regulation, there is little evidence that regulatory di¤erences constitute the most relevant determinant of trade  ows as the PHH predicts. Various reasons why this is the case from an empirical viewpoint have been proposed (e.g., data, measurement of environmental stringency); however, reasons why the PHH may fail theoretically have not received much attention. Potential exceptions are the tailpipe regulation examined in McAusland (2008), where stricter regulation may (when dirty good demand is price elastic) result in greater exports of dirty goods, and the environmental policy complementarity found in Copeland and Taylor (2005), where endogenous world prices in a general equilibrium setup generate decreases in emissions in unconstrained countries . In this paper, we provide a quite di¤erent theoretical explanation by examining the relationship between FDI and endogenous environmental standards. 3

The focus of existing theoretical and empirical literatures is mostly on the e¤ects of local environmental policies on investment  ows (List and Co, 2000; Keller and Levinson, 2002; Javorcik and Wei, 2004; Xing and Kolstad, 2002). Little formal work is available on the impact of foreign direct investment on environmental policies. Most closely related to our paper is Markusen et al. (1993, 1995). In Markusen et al. (1993), a single active regional government in uences the plant location of a single ...rm with increasing returns to scale and local pollution; in Markusen et al. (1995), the plant location problem is extended to the case in which both regional governments are active in policy setting. Our analytical framework di¤ers from these models in several important ways. First, rather than examining the impact of environmental policy on the location decision of production, we focus on the impact of the option for FDI (potential relocation of production) on the choice of environmental policy. Second, instead of a single ...rm choosing to locate in both regions (multi-plant), one region, or no region, we assume two independent ...rms producing for (and competing in) the two markets. Third, we do not rely on increasing returns to scale or shipping costs to in uence the location (FDI) decision. Finally, instead of two symmetric regions selecting environmental policy, we rely on the two countries placing di¤erent weights on environmental damages to generate environmental policy di¤erences in the absence of FDI (that is, to induce a PHH incentive for FDI). Another related paper is Cole et al. (2006), in which a model of political economy with lobbying and government corruption is employed to explicitly examine the relationship between FDI and environmental policy. While the e¤ect on environmental policy of an additional (foreign) producer is considered, the entry decision of the foreign ...rm is exogenous. Here, we are instead interested in the choice of FDI and how this choice is manipulated through environmental policy, depending on the external bene...ts of FDI. The key proposition in Cole et al. that foreign entry results in stricter environmental policy (when corruption is low) is con...rmed in most of the cases we cover, with an important exception: we do encounter cases in which FDI does not occur but environmental policy is still a¤ected. Finally, the relationship between FDI and environmetal policies is also considered in Kayalica and Lahiri (2005) in the context of a model that involves two countries, competing to export to a third country, which di¤er in whether their ...rms are domestically owned or are foreign owned. The main question in Kayalica and Lahiri is then about how the FDI host country' s emission standard compares to the competing country' s emission standard both when the number of foreign ...rms in the FDI host country is exogenous and when foreign ...rms can freely enter and exit. In contrast, we are interested in FDI decisions that result from environmental policy di¤erences between two countries and in how the country with originally more lax emission standards adjusts its environmental policy in response to the threat of FDI. Our analysis is directly related to the pollution

haven hypothesis and the implications of environmental policy adjustment in response to FDI access for the existence of pollution havens. In the present paper, we aim at ...lling the gap in the literature by addressing the following questions: (1) Under what conditions do di¤erences in environmental regulation across countries give ...rms in countries with more stringent standards incentives to engage in FDI in countries with less stringent standards (this question is directly related to the PHH)? (2) How do these incentives a¤ect local environmental policy and welfare in recipient countries? (3) Under what circumstances would an FDI-recipient country choose to tighten its environmental policy in response to FDI? (4) If this tightening occurs, would the recipient country ever select an environmental standard that is tighter than the standard of the source country (that is, would the recipient ever become more "green"than the originally green country)? (5) If FDI reduces the welfare of the recipient country, would the recipient country manipulate its standard to prevent FDI? (6) More generally, under what conditions would the recipient country adjust its emission standard to attract FDI when the source country would prefer exporting and to prevent FDI when the source country would prefer engaging in FDI? (7) What is the impact of FDI on the state of the environment worldwide and in the FDI-recipient country? To answer the above questions, we use a two-country oligopoly model of intra-industry trade. As in the perfectly competitive model employed in Copeland and Taylor (1994), we assume pollution to be purely local and allow for a technology that abates emissions of pollution. Both countries have the same production and abatement technologies. In order to examine the implications of FDI, we consider a threestage game. In the ...rst stage, countries simultaneously decide their environmental policy, choosing the emission standards for local ...rms that maximize welfare de...ned as the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus less environmental damages. Each country takes into account environmental damages when setting environmental policy, but the two countries di¤er in the weight they assign to environmental damage.1 The second stage of the game involves the ...rm' s decision about whether to serve foreign markets through export or FDI. In this setup, the ...rm in the country with more stringent environmental standards could move production to the country with more lax standards, depending on the bene...ts of such a move relative to the cost of setting up a foreign plant.2 Finally, ...rms engage in Cournot competition in the product markets. In order to maintain the focus of the analysis on the implications of asymmetric emission standards for foreign direct investment, we ignore trade policy.
We consider two similar countries to avoid non-environmental policy related incentives for FDI. The model is thus best suited for the analysis of the impact of FDI on policy setting among equally industrialized countries rather than between North and South. 2 We ignore the possibility of reciprocal FDI and focus on the FDI decision of the home ...rm.

In the absence of FDI, the country which places less emphasis on environmental damage has an incentive to lower environmental standards to become more competitive in world markets; however, once FDI is available as a mode of entry, the country is confronted with two con icting e¤ects of FDI. On one hand, FDI has a positive e¤ect through greater local production/consumption associated with lower domestic prices (higher consumer surplus) and may generate external bene...ts. On the other hand, FDI has a negative e¤ect through lower pro...ts for the domestic ...rm due to a loss in competitive advantage (lower producer surplus) and additional environmental damages from greater local production. If the home country assigns a higher weight on environmental damage than the foreign country does, the former can be considered, in the absence of an FDI option, as the more environmentally friendly or "green" country while the latter is the less environmental friendly or "grey" country. As the home country becomes more environmentally sensitive (as its weight on environmental damage increases), it chooses more stringent emission standards while the foreign country chooses less stringent standards. We ...rst consider a traditional PHH case in which the foreign country does not alter its emission standard in response to FDI. Not surprisingly, we ...nd that, as long as the ...xed cost of having an additional plant is su¢ ciently low and abatement is costly, the home ...rm facing a less stringent environmental standard abroad has incentives to relocate its production to the foreign country (the traditional PHH case). We then allow for the possibility that the host country is able to respond to FDI. In such a case, when FDI occurs, the foreign country has two active producers within its borders, and the home ...rm faces the same standard set by the foreign country for the foreign ...rm. Thus, the pro...t-shifting motive disappears while the environmental damage e¤ect widens; as a result, the foreign country tightens its emission standard. Interestingly, when the two countries are su¢ ciently similar in weighing environmental damages, the "grey" country (foreign country) can become greener than the originally "green" country (home country). More interestingly, there are cases in which the home ...rm chooses to engage in FDI (rather than to export) in the foreign country even though the foreign emission standard is stricter than its own standard under the export case. Intuitively, as countries become more asymmetric in their environmental friendliness, the gap between their standards increases under export; as long as the asymmetry is not too large, the home ...rm would prefer to relocate to the foreign country in order to level the playing ...eld even if relocation entails facing a tighter standard. When allowing the foreign country to respond to the home ...rm' s FDI, we consider the question of whether the foreign country can induce export (FDI) via preventing (attracting) FDI by adjusting its standard and, if so, whether this move leads to higher welfare in the foreign country and a cleaner environment

worldwide. Hence, we obtain that, when the extra weight the home country assigns to environmental damage is low and the bene...t the foreign country derives from the home country' s FDI is high, the foreign country is better o¤ inducing the home ...rm to engage in FDI by increasing its emission standard above the level prevailing under export; when the extra weight is high and the bene...t is low, the foreign country is better o¤ inducing the home ...rm to export by lowering its standard below the level prevailing under FDI. The export (FDI) equilibrium without inducement ensues when the extra weight and bene...t are both low (high). Relative to the case in which environmental policy is not adjusted, pollution havens that would have existed do not come about when FDI is prevented while other pollution havens that would have not existed are generated when FDI is attracted. From a purely environmental perspective, we show that, relative to the export case, the home ...rm' s FDI results in two counteracting e¤ects in the foreign country: an emission standard e¤ ect which amounts to a reduction in emission standards, and a scale e¤ ect which amounts to an increase in output. As the former e¤ect dominates the latter, given the convexity of costs/damages, FDI leads to a cleaner environment in the foreign country (and thus worldwide) relative to the export case. However, when the foreign country takes into account the home ...rm' s option to engage in FDI and responds by adjusting its standard to either prevent or induce FDI, we obtain that, when FDI is induced, a dirtier world environment can result if the two countries do not di¤er substantially in their valuation of environmental damage and that, as the home ...rm' s cost of FDI increases, a dirtier environment becomes more likely. Relative to the FDI case, we also ...nd that, when export is induced, a cleaner environment obtains if the two countries di¤er substantially in their valuation of environmental damage and that, as the home ...rm' s cost of FDI decreases, a cleaner world environment becomes more likely.

Model

We develop an oligopoly model of trade with two countries (h for home and f for foreign) and two goods (x and y ). Good y is the numeraire good produced under perfect competition with a constant-returns-toscale technology. There is no pollution associated with the production of good y . Good x, the polluting (dirty) good, is produced by a single pro...t-maximizing ...rm in each country at zero marginal cost. For convenience, we refer to home (foreign) country' s monopolist as ...rm h (f ). We assume that preferences over the two goods are quasi-linear and the inverse demand for good x in each country is linear, that is, pi (xi ) = X xzi ; (1)

z =h;f

where xi denotes the total quantity of good x sold in country i, pi denotes the price of good x in country i, and xzi denotes the output sold by country z ' s ...rm in country i: Firm i' s total production is comprised of its sales in the domestic market denoted by xii and in the foreign market denoted by xij with i 6= j . Firms compete in quantities (Cournot) in each market. For simplicity, we assume that each unit of x produced generates one unit of pollution and that, as in Copeland and Taylor (1994), pollution is purely local. Moreover, abatement is possible but costly. Speci...cally, if a government imposes a cap on the emissions of ...rm i, denoted ei , the cost of meeting this target is Ci (ai ) = a2 i ; 2 (2)

where a denotes abatement which is equal to the di¤erence between production and the appropriate emission standard or 0 X 1

Environmental damages are quadratic in unabated local emissions and equal to

(4)

To examine the implications of FDI access, we consider a three-stage game. In the ...rst stage, countries simultaneously decide over their environmental policy, choosing the welfare-maximizing emission standards for local ...rms. Welfare is de...ned as the sum of consumer surplus (CS ) and producer surplus (P S ) less environmental damages ( ). To di¤erentiate between the two countries in terms of their environmental attitude so that they select distinct emission standards, we assume that the home country places heavier emphasis on environmental damages in its welfare.3 Hence, the welfare of the home country is Wh (e) CSh (e) + X

j =h;f

where e = [eh ; ef ] is the vector of emission standards, w is a positive parameter which captures the additional value that the home country places on the environment, and country j .
We would have qualitatively similar results by assuming that the two countries have di¤erent weights on producer surplus. However, as our focus is on environmental policy, how it responds to FDI, and how it can be manipulated to attract or prevent FDI, we maintain the assumption that the two countries di¤er in their environmental awareness.

In the second stage of the game, ...rm h decides whether to serve the foreign market through export or FDI. In this setup, the ...rm in the country with a more stringent environmental standard could move production to the country with a more lax standard, depending on the bene...t of such a move relative to the cost of setting up a foreign plant, which we assume to be ...xed at F . Finally, in the third stage, ...rms engage in Cournot competition in the two product markets. We obtain the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) by backward induction.

Environmental Policy and Welfare under Trade

For the time being, we assume that FDI is not an option for the ...rms and intra-industry trade takes place between countries. This case serves as a benchmark to study the implications of FDI for strategic environmental policy and social welfare. To this end, we modify our game into a two-stage non-cooperative game between ...rms and governments. In the ...rst stage, countries simultaneously choose the welfaremaximizing emission standards for local ...rms; in the second stage, ...rms compete a la Cournot in the product markets. Since each ...rm produces within its own country, it is subjected to the local emission standard. Hence, ...rm i faces an endogenously determined emission standard ei and the amount of pollution it abates is ai = so that its pro...t is

It is immediate that the marginal cost of abatement is equal to abatement itself. We note that, in order to maintain the focus of our analysis on the implications of asymmetric emission standards for foreign direct investment, we ignore trade policy.4 Given the emission standards eh and ef , the pro...t-maximizing output choices must satisfy @ i @xii @ i @xij = = 3xii 3xij xji xjj xij + ei = 0 xii + ei = 0; i; j = h; f: (9)

We thus have that ei and ej are strategic substitutes as @ 2 Wi = @ei @ej 23 < 0: 225 (17)

(19)

The negative relationship between home environmental policy and foreign environmental policy stems from the nature of Cournot competition and provides support for the presence of a pro...t-shifting motive. We also note that, while function,

is independent of w, the absolute value of the slope of the home country' s reaction

, falls with w, @ @eh @ef < 0; @w

(20)

implying that the choice of the home country' s emission standard becomes less sensitive to the foreign country' s choice as the home country becomes more environmentally conscious (or the additional weight it places on environmental damage increases).5 Simultaneously solving the two conditions in (15), we can express the optimal emission standards in the export scenario (eex i ) as @ 2 Wi @ei @ej @ 2 Wi @ 2 Wj @e2 @e2 i j @ 2 Wj @e2 j !

so that standards are tighter in the home country than in the foreign country. Thus, in the absence of an FDI option, the home country can be considered as the more environmentally friendly or "green" country while the foreign country is the less environmentally friendly or the "grey" country. Accordingly, as the home country becomes more environmentally sensitive (as w increases), it chooses more stringent emission standards while the foreign country chooses less stringent standards,6 that is, @eex f @w >0> @eex h : @w (23)

Using the optimal emission standards, we can write the pro...t functions of the two ...rms in terms of

Foreign Direct Investment

FDI occurs if it is pro...table for the home ...rm to move production to the foreign country in order to take advantage of the higher emission standard in that country (or to level the playing ...eld, as we discuss below). By relocating production to the foreign country, the home ...rm has to pay an exogenous plantlevel ...xed cost equal to F . We ignore the possibility of reciprocal FDI and focus on the FDI decision of the home ...rm. In addition, we allow for the possibility that the FDI-recipient or host country (i.e., the foreign country) bene...ts or su¤ers from the home ...rm' s FDI. We denote the bene...t (loss if negative) as B and, for simplicity, assume that it is exogenously given. In essence, B captures spillover e¤ects of FDI in the host country. Although standard theory points to FDI-generated externalities which raise the productivity of host factors of production (Glass and Saggi, 1999 and 2002), the evidence about the presence of productivity spillovers is rather mixed. While a positive industry-level correlation between FDI and productivity is detected in Caves (1974), Blomström (1986), and Dri¢ eld (2000), the incidence of spillovers is found to be in uenced by host industry' s and host country' s characteristics. At the micro-level, no evidence of higher levels of total factor productivity is found in sectors with higher foreign participation in Morocco (Haddad and Harrison, 1993), for Venezuelan manufacturing companies (Aitken and Harrison, 1999), and for low-technology Indian companies (Kathuria, 1998 and 2000).

Hence, in equilibrium, ...rm i' s output levels are xii = xij = + ef ; 5 i; j = h; f and i 6= j: (29)

In the following discussion, we examine several cases which di¤er in how the FDI-recipient country (foreign country) reacts to FDI. First, we consider the case of no reaction to FDI: the foreign country selects the emission standard derived above for the export scenario regardless of whether FDI occurs. This corresponds to a traditional pollution haven hypothesis case. Then, we examine the case in which the foreign country endogenously determines its emission standard in response to FDI; we thus obtain conditions under which the home ...rm undertakes FDI and discuss the implications of FDI for the foreign country' s welfare. Finally, we consider whether the foreign ...rm has incentives to modify its standard to prevent (attract) FDI when FDI yields higher (lower) pro...ts to the home ...rm than exporting and discuss the welfare and environmental implications of such a strategy.

4.1

No response to FDI

In a typical pollution haven hypothesis case, ...rms facing weaker environmental standards in foreign countries shift production to those countries (in our model through FDI) without in uencing local standards. With the foreign country choosing the emission standard prevailing under export, pro...t maximization by each ...rm yields identical output levels as

(32)

We note that FDI only occurs if the home ...rm' s pro...ts are greater through FDI than through export. Speci...cally, if the ...xed cost of relocating production to the foreign country is su¢ ciently low, the home ...rm prefers FDI to export as a mode of entry, that is,

which says that the critical value of F (below which the home ...rm engages in FDI) increases in w. In other words, as the emission standards of the two countries become more asymmetric (as w increases), the home ...rm has greater incentives to engage in FDI in the foreign country. When production shifts from the home country to the foreign country, environmental damages in the home country fall to zero. Thus, as long as the home ...rm has an incentive to perform FDI, the home country is better o¤ relative to the export case. We now consider the foreign country' s welfare. If there exists no bene...t from FDI, the foreign country strictly prefers the home ...rm to export rather than to perform FDI. There are three distinct e¤ects of FDI on the foreign country: (i ) a decrease in the foreign ...rm' s pro...ts from a loss in competitive advantage; (ii ) an increase in environmental damages from a rise in local production; (iii ) an increase in consumer surplus from a decrease in the price. The ...rst two e¤ects of FDI outweigh the last e¤ect and foreign welfare falls if there exists no bene...t from receiving FDI. Hence, we can always identify a (positive) critical bene...t level, denoted by B nr , above which the foreign country prefers the home ...rm to engage in FDI rather than export, that is,

From an environmental perspective, whenever the home ...rm engages in FDI and the foreign country does not change its environmental policy, environmental damages are higher in the foreign country (and therefore worldwide) relative to the export case.7

4.2

Optimum Response to FDI

Next, we consider the case in which the foreign country, in response to FDI, optimally adjusts its emission standard. If FDI occurs, the foreign country has two active producers within its borders and the home ...rm faces the same standard set by the foreign country for the foreign ...rm. Thus, the pro...t-shifting motive disappears while the environmental damage e¤ect widens. As a result, the foreign country has an incentive to lower its emission standard when faced with FDI, so that FDI acts as a disciplining device for governments wishing to exploit environmental standards to gain competitive advantage. Stage three of the game remains the same as in the no response case, so that output levels are given by (29). The foreign country, however, faces twice the environmental damages as in the export case; accordingly, it adjusts its emission standard to satisfy 12 63ef @Wf = = 0; @ef 25 which gives
DI = eF f

(38)

4 21

(39)

as the optimal emission standard in the foreign country under FDI. Upon comparison of the above with (21), we obtain Proposition 1: The optimum emission standard in the foreign country is always more stringent when the foreign country responds to FDI optimally relative to the export and no response cases. Furthermore, the gap between the export and FDI standards in the foreign country widens as the home country becomes more environmentally conscious:
DI eF f

< 0 and

(40)

Since pollution is local, the foreign country not only takes into account the environmental damages generated by its own ...rm but also the damages generated by the home ...rm. In the absence of any adjustment in the emission standard, consumer surplus is higher while producer surplus is lower since the protection of the domestic industry a¤orded by a weaker emission standard is lost as the home ...rm enters and receives the same protection. Moreover, emissions (thus environmental damages) rise signi...cantly.

See appendix for details on critical F and B values under both no response and accomodation.

Since the foreign country' s bene...t from FDI is exogenous, it does not a¤ect the emission standard. In such a case, the negative e¤ects of FDI on producer surplus and environmental damage dominate the positive e¤ect on consumer surplus. Thus, as we illustrate in Figure 1, the foreign country has an incentive to reduce its emission standard relative to the export case. More interesting is the comparison of the emission standard in the foreign country (originally the grey country) under FDI, which both the foreign and home ...rms face, with the emission standard in the home country (originally the green country) in the export scenario, that is,

1:08. Hence, we obtain

Proposition 2: When the foreign country (originally the grey country) responds optimally to the home ...rm' s FDI, its emission standard falls below the home country' s (originally the green country) standard under export if w is su¢ ciently low. The above proposition implies that, when the home ...rm engages in FDI in the foreign country and the two countries'weights on environmental damage are very di¤erent, the grey country (the foreign country) selects an environmental standard that is weaker than the standard of the originally green country (the home country) under export. However, as we also show in Figure 1, the foreign country can become "greener" than the green country (the home country) when the two countries are su¢ ciently similar in weighing environmental damages. [Insert Figure 1 here] When the two countries are quite di¤erent, their export standards are quite di¤erent; speci...cally, the standard in the foreign country is much higher than that in the home country. While FDI generates additional environmental damages and takes away pro...t-shifting motives, thus inducing the foreign country to lower its standard, these e¤ects are not su¢ ciently large to eliminate the policy gap resulting from a divergence in the two countries'environmental positions. However, when the two countries are similar (i.e., w is su¢ ciently low), the two countries'emission standards are not very di¤erent in the export scenario so that the damage e¤ect and weakened pro...t-shifting e¤ect under FDI outweigh the environmental weight di¤erential e¤ect. From a purely environmental perspective, the home ...rm' s FDI results in two counteracting e¤ects in the foreign country: (i ) an emission standard e¤ ect, according to which, when FDI is accommodated, the foreign country' s emission standard falls (even below the green country' s standard under export when 16

w < w); (ii ) a scale e¤ ect, according to which FDI raises the production level in the foreign country relative to the export case and this, in turn, increases environmental damages for a given standard. The former e¤ect dominates the latter and FDI leads to a cleaner environment in the foreign country (and thus worldwide) relative to the export case when the foreign country responds to the home ...rm' s FDI by lowering its emission standard. The environmental improvement does depend on w; speci...cally, as w increases, the improvement gets larger or h @ ex eex f f where

As above mentioned, FDI only occurs if the home ...rm' s pro...ts are greater through FDI than through export. Again, if the ...xed cost of relocating production to foreign country is su¢ ciently low, the home ...rm prefers FDI to export as a mode of entry, that is,

Proposition 3: The incentive to perform FDI increases in w. For w < w, the home ...rm does not engage in FDI. For w > w, the home ...rm engages in FDI even if it entails facing tighter standards than under export at values of w ranging between w and w. As illustrated in Figure 2, the critical F value below which the home ...rm engages in FDI, F F DI , increases in w. In other words, as the emission standards become relatively more asymmetric (as w
DI < eex increases), the home ...rm has greater incentives to perform FDI in the foreign country. Also, as eF f f

17

holds, F F DI < F nr always obtains. For su¢ ciently small values of w (w < w), the home ...rm does not have any incentive to perform FDI in a country which adjusts its standard optimally and thus F F DI < 0 when w < w. However, there are instances in which the home ...rm chooses to engage in FDI even though the foreign emission standard falls below its own standard under export (since w > w). As w increases, the gap between the two countries'standards widens under export. Provided that w is not too large (w < w), the home ...rm prefers relocating to the foreign country, even if it ends up facing tighter standards, in order to level the playing ...eld. Intuitively, if the home ...rm does not engage in FDI, its cost of abatement is higher than that of its competitor. By relocating to the foreign country, the home ...rm faces the same marginal abatement cost as the foreign ...rm so that it is no longer at a competitive disadvantage. When w is su¢ ciently high (w > w), the home ...rm faces a lower marginal abatement cost in the foreign country under FDI relative to export. Hence, the home ...rm has two reasons to engage in FDI: (i ) to take advantage of lower abatement costs and (ii ) to remove the competitive advantage of the foreign ...rm resulting from di¤erences in standards. [Insert Figure 2 here] Comparing the FDI regions of no response and optimal response in Figure 2, we can see that some FDI which would have occurred in the absence of accomodation is deterred when environmental standards are optimally adjusted (dark grey shaded area). This suggests that optimal response weakens the incentive to relocate production, thereby weakening the PHH (at least in the absence of manipulation of standards to induce FDI, as we show below). We can easily show that, if there exists no bene...t from FDI, the foreign country strictly prefers the home ...rm to export rather than to engage in FDI. The (positive) critical bene...t level, denoted by B F DI , above which the foreign country is better o¤ under FDI relative to export satis...es

Since the foreign country determines its emission standard optimally, the critical bene...t level is smaller than the one obtained under no response, that is, B F DI < B nr , as we illustrate in Figure 3. As the home ...rm' s choice of whether to perform FDI is in uenced, to some degree, by the foreign country' s emission standard, we next consider the question of whether the foreign country can induce 18

export (FDI) via preventing (attracting) FDI by adjusting its standard and, if so, whether this can lead to higher foreign welfare.8

4.3

Adjustment in Emission Standards

If standards can be tightened or relaxed to eliminate or generate incentives for the home ...rm to engage in FDI, the foreign country can select its emission standard such that the home ...rm is (at most) indi¤erent between export and FDI. For a given ef , the home ...rm' s pro...t under FDI is

Using the expressions in (53), we obtain the emission standard in the foreign country (denoted by e ef ) that

8 Industrial policy could be used here rather than environmental policy. Since the externality is environmental, it is not unreasonable to adjust environmental policy to induce or prevent FDI. Further, national treatment rules of the WTO (Article III) may prevent the use of industrial policy against foreign entrants.

that is, e ef rises in F and falls in w. Intuitively, as w increases, that is, the two countries become more asymmetric in their valuation of environmental damages, the home ...rm' s incentive to engage in FDI increases as the gap between the emission standards of the two countries increases, so that the foreign country can induce or prevent FDI with a lower standard. To understand the intuition behind the positive
DI < e e¤ect of a change in F on the threshold standard e ef , we note that eF ef < eex f f for combinations of

F and w values at which the foreign country may opt for environmental policy manipulation to induce or prevent FDI.9 If the home ...rm has no incentive to engage in FDI under optimum standards (F > F F DI ) while the foreign country prefers FDI to export (B > B F DI ), the foreign country must increase its standard
DI to make FDI attractive (or, equally, to make export unattractive); hence, e DI . If the above eF ef > eF f f

home ...rm has an incentive to engage in FDI under optimum standards (F < F F DI ) while the foreign country prefers export to FDI (B < B F DI ), the foreign country must lower its standard below eex f to make export attractive or FDI unattractive; hence, e ef < eex s f . We thus have that, as F increases, the home ...rm' incentive to perform FDI decreases so that the foreign country has to increase its emission standard above
DI by more to induce FDI in the ...rst instance (that is, when the home ...rm does not want to engage in eF f

FDI but the foreign country prefers FDI to export) while it has to decrease it below eex f by less to induce export in the second instance (that is, when the home ...rm wants to engage in FDI but the foreign country prefers export to FDI); in both cases, the threshold standard e ef increases as F increases.

When the foreign country prevents FDI by lowering its standard below eex f and the home ...rm decides

to export, the home country adjusts its emission standard as well. Given that the emission standards of the two countries are strategic substitutes, a lower emission standard in the foreign country implies a higher emission standard in the home country, that is, )e eh = e ef < eex f = + ef 2e > eex h ; (57)

we thus have that

so that the gap in environmental policy between the two countries narrows, through a tightening of the foreign standard and a weakening of the home standard, when export is induced as opposed to being optimally chosen by the home ...rm.10 In the following subsection, we derive the conditions under which adjusting the emission standard to induce export or FDI is in the interest of the foreign country. To this end, we compare the foreign country' s

We ...nally examine the environmental implications of adjusting emission standards to induce or prevent FDI from a global perspective as well as from the foreign country' s perspective. 4.3.1 Attracting FDI

We ...rst consider the case in which the home ...rm has no incentive to engage in FDI under optimum standards (F > F F DI ). In such a case, since the negative impacts on producer surplus dominates the positive e¤ects on consumer surplus, the foreign country can be better o¤ by inducing FDI with e ef only if B>B=

It follows immediately that the above critical bene...t level (B ) rises in F and falls in w since the foreign country has to make larger adjustments in its emission standard (this is more costly from a welfare perF DI (e ef ) spective) to induce FDI when F gets larger or w gets smaller. Also, as Wf F DI eF DI , we Wf f

always obtain that B

In light of the above, we have Proposition 4: Suppose that F > F F DI holds. Then, the following equilibria result: (i) when B < B , the home ...rm exports and the home and foreign countries choose their optimum
ex emission standards eex h and ef ;

(ii) when B > B , the foreign country induces the home ...rm to engage in FDI by adjusting its emission
DI < e ef < eex standard to e ef where eF f . f

We illustrate the equilibria for a given ...xed cost of relocation and market size ( ) in Figure 4. For a given F , we use (47) to obtain the value of w (w b) such that the home ...rm prefers export for w < w b and FDI

However, for B > B , the foreign country prefers FDI and thus induces the home ...rm to engage in FDI by
DI ; for B < B , the foreign country prefers export and thus the optimum increasing its standard above eF f ex export emission standards (eex f and eh ) prevail. Induced FDI results in a Pareto improvement over export:

for w > w b. As F increases, w b increases so that the home ...rm prefers export for a wider range of w values.

the home country is better o¤ from higher producer surplus and consumer surplus and lower environmental damages; the foreign country is better o¤ from the external bene...ts of FDI and higher consumer surplus that o¤set the additional environmental damages and reduced producer surplus. In this case, manipulation

21

of standards by the foreign country creates incentives to relocate production and gives rise to pollution havens which would have not existed under exogenous standards, as captured by the light grey shaded area in Figure 4. [Insert Figure 4] From an environmental perspective, when we compare worldwide environmental damages under export and under induced FDI, we obtain Proposition 5: For a given F , there exists a wl such that and
F DI f F DI f

wl is increasing in F . When the home ...rm does not have any incentive to engage in FDI but the foreign country adjusts its standard to induce FDI, the environment is dirtier under FDI relative to export when the two countries are not substantially di¤erent in their valuation of environmental damages unless the ...xed cost is zero. As the two countries become more asymmetric (w increases), the foreign country can induce FDI with a smaller upward adjustment in its standard (from eex f ) so that it becomes less likely for the environment to be dirtier under FDI. Conversely, as the cost of FDI the home ...rm faces increases, the foreign country has to adjust its standard upward by a larger amount in order to induce the home ...rm to engage in FDI; hence, the range of w values for which the environment is dirtier under FDI widens. In Figure 5, we plot the critical F (F F DI ), as a function of w, below which the home ...rm prefers FDI over export and two isovalues curves. The isovalue curve labelled DF DI shows the combinations of w and F such that the world' s environmental damages under induced FDI is exactly the same as that under export. Above the DF DI curve, damages are higher under induced FDI; below the curve, damages are higher under export. For a given F , the F F DI curve gives the critical w (w b) such that the home country prefers export the resulting worldwide environmental quality is worse for w < wl and better for wl < w < w b.

When the home ...rm does have an incentive to engage in FDI but the foreign country adjusts its standard to induce export, the environment is dirtier under FDI relative to export when the two countries are substantially di¤erent in their valuation of environmental damages. As the two countries become more symmetric (w decreases), the foreign country can induce export with a smaller downward adjustment in its standard (from eex f ) so that it becomes less likely for the environment to be dirtier under FDI. As the cost of FDI the home ...rm faces increases, the foreign country has to adjust its standard downward by a smaller amount in order to induce the home ...rm to export; hence, the range of w values for which the environment is dirtier under FDI narrows. In Figure 5, the isovalue curve labelled Dex gives the combinations of w and F such that the world' s environmental damage under FDI is exactly the same as that under induced export. Above the Dex curve, damages are lower under FDI; below the curve, they are higher under induced export. For a given F , the F F DI curve gives the critical w (w b) such that the home country prefers FDI over export FDI for w > w b. If environmental quality is worse for w b < w < wu and better for w > wu . As in the induced FDI case, we ...nd that it is possible for the foreign pollution level under FDI to be

for wf u < w < wu .11

Conclusion

An important question that has largely been ignored in the literature on the relationship between FDI and environmental policy is about strategic considerations countries entertain in setting their environmental standards under the threat of increased production from FDI, particularly when pollution is local. According to the standard PHH argument, as it relates to FDI, production shifts from countries with stringent standards to countries with weaker standards, presumably to bene...t from lower production or abatement costs. Although there are many other factors determining plant location, the idea that ...rms would chase lower standards is not unreasonable and could lead to a "race to the bottom"in environmental policy. Surprisingly, the empirical evidence on the PHH is limited and, while empirical reasons have been suggested why the PHH may not hold (e.g., data, measurement of environmental stringency), theoretical explana11 For F = 0:02, the home ...rm may be induced to engage in export for w > w b 1:09. If export is induced, the pollution level increases in the foreign country for w > wf u 1:26 and worldwide for w > wu 1:71. Hence, environmental quality improves in the foreign country for 1:09 < w < 1:26 and worldwide for 1:09 < w < 1:71.

24

tions for the possible failure of the PHH have not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we attempt to provide one such theoretical explanation by examining the relationship between FDI and endogenous standards, leaving the empirical investigation of the implications of FDI for environmental policy to future work. Aside from considering the question of whether and when di¤erences in environmental policies trigger ...rms in countries with stringent standards to move production to countries with less stringent standards, we also examine the impact that FDI has on global pollution as well as on the state of the environment in FDI-recipient countries. In an oligopoly model of trade which involves two countries di¤ering in their environmental friendliness, with the home country exhibiting greater concern for the environment (and thus labelled "green " ), and local pollution, we show that standards can become tighter in the face of FDI and, although unlikely, may even become stricter in the originally grey country than in the originally green country (this would happen in instances in which the two countries are not very di¤erent in how they value environmental damages). Thus, when environmental policy is endogenous, the PHH is weakened by the fact that the tightening of standards in FDI-recipient countries creates weaker incentives for FDI. The standard in the grey (FDI-recipient) country is in fact always stricter under FDI, when the country responds optimally to FDI, than under export. As the incentive for the green (FDI-source) country to engage in FDI increases with its incremental environmental consciousness, the greater the extent to which the two countries di¤er in their valuation of the environment is, the more stringent the foreign standard is under FDI than under export. Hence, when the grey country adjusts its environmental policy in response to FDI, the di¤erential in environmental standards is smaller, for a given di¤erence in environmental concern between the two countries, than it would be without a reaction to increased domestic production and pollution and decreases as the two countries become more divergent. The adjustment amounts to a reduction in the likelihood that ...rms in the green (home) country engage in FDI in the grey (foreign) country; the greater the environmental concern gap between the two countries is (or the smaller the environmental policy gap between the two countries under FDI with optimal response), the less likely the ...rm in the green country is to prefer FDI over export. In this way, FDI acts as a disciplining device for countries considering weakening their environmental standards for competitive gain. At the same time, the strenghtening of standards under FDI serves to reduce incentives for relocation of production, so that less relocation occurs due to di¤erences in environmental standards. This amounts to a weakening of the traditional pollution haven hypothesis: ...rms may not choose to relocate in response to di¤erences in environmental policy as, by so doing, they

25

would face overly strict adjusted standards in the new location. We then derive conditions under which the foreign country has incentives to manipulate its standard to induce FDI when the home country prefers export (that is, when the ...xed cost of FDI is above its threshold level) or to induce export when the home country prefers FDI (that is, when the ...xed cost of FDI is below its threshold level). Whenever manipulation is optimal, the foreign standard is weaker in the ...rst instance (that is, when FDI is induced) than under FDI when it is not induced and stricter in the second instance (that is, when export is induced) than under export when it is not induced. The possible manipulation of environmental policy by the foreign country to induce or prevent FDI, depending on whether the bene...t from FDI exceeds or falls short of its threshold level, has important implications for the overall e¤ect of FDI on the state of the environment. In fact, while FDI always results in a cleaner environment in the foreign country (and thus worldwide) in the absence of manipulation as the emission standard e¤ ect (tightening of foreign standard) always dominates the scale e¤ ect (increase in production in the foreign country) due to the convexity of damages, whether FDI yields a cleaner or dirtier environment in the presence of manipulation depends on how di¤erent the two countries are in their valuation of the environment. Speci...cally, FDI worsens (improves) the environment when the two countries are quite similar (di¤erent) and FDI is induced or when the two countries are quite di¤erent (similar) and FDI is not induced. That di¤erences in environmental awareness play an important role in how FDI a¤ects the environment stems from the fact that incentives to engage in FDI increase with the home country' s environmental awareness over and above that of the foreign country; the more di¤erent the two countries are, the larger the gap in their environmental standards and the greater the bene...ts the home country can derive from FDI. When FDI is induced, the foreign standard is less stringent than in the absence of manipulation but the gap between the two standards decreases as the home country' s incentives for FDI increase (that is, as the home country becomes more environmentally conscious); hence, the more similar the two countries are, the larger the gap and the dirtier the environment. On the other hand, when FDI is not induced, the foreign standard is more stringent than under export but the gap between the foreign standard under FDI and the foreign standard under induced export decreases as the home country becomes more environmentally conscious (or the incentives for FDI increase); hence, the more di¤erent the two countries are, the smaller the gap and the dirtier the environment. Overall, whenever FDI occurs with or without inducement, pollution is likely to decrease in FDI-recipient countries and worldwide whenever there exist neither trivial nor substantial di¤erences in environmental attitudes between the FDI-recipient and the FDI-source countries. As the cost

of engaging in FDI increases, pollution is less likely to decrease under FDI, particularly in less divergent countries; in other words, the more costly FDI is, the less similar the two countries have to be in their environmental awareness for pollution to decrease under FDI. The presence of external bene...ts of FDI has thus additional implications for the pollution haven hypothesis: if FDI provides signi...cant external bene...ts to the recipient nation, we would expect to see more PHH-induced relocation of production as countries weaken standards to attract investment (light grey area in Figure 4); if the spillover e¤ects of FDI are small or negative, countries may tighten standards to prevent PHH-driven relocation of production (dark grey area in Figure 4). Equilibrium outcomes ultimately depend on the ...xed costs of relocation and how di¤erently countries weigh environmental damages. Nonetheless, we show that, in most cases, FDI results in a tightening of environmental policy and is likely to improve the quality of the world environment (at least among countries similar in production and abatement technology that account for environmental damages when setting policy).

Appendix
Emission standards

Using the ...rst-order conditions for welfare maximization with respect to the standards, we can write the two countries'reaction functions as eh = and ef = 114 23eh ; 313 114 23ef 313 + 225w

we thus have that the absolute value of the slope of the home country' s reaction function is decreasing in w, that is, @ @eh @ef = @w 23 (225) < 0; (313 + 225w)2

while the slope of the foreign country' s reaction function is independent of w. Letting =
1 112+75w ,

=

1 698+525w ,

and

=

1 6496+4695w ,

we can express the export standards as ;

eex h = 2204 so that eex f

and

eex f = 38(58 + 45w )

eex h = 1710

w > 0;

27

and the marginal e¤ects of w on the standards as @eex h = @w 4695 eex h <0 and @eex f @w = 345 eex h > 0:

The foreign standard prevailing under FDI in the absence of any response by the foreign country is the same as that under export, that is, eex f . With accommodation, that is, when the foreign country adjusts its standard in response to FDI,
DI = eF f 4 21

< eex f , with the di¤erence in standards increasing in w . We in fact have that
DI eF f

eex f =

and @ eex f Furthermore,

eex h = 20

145 313 + w 3 7

which is positive for w > w =

1015 939 .

Under environmental policy adjustment by the foreign country to induce or prevent FDI, we have that e ef = 1 2 610201 + 824400w + 270000w2 23 5(313 + 225w)M

and

where

e eh = [2 (12287 + 8775w) M= p r 2 450 (13 + 16w)2 450 23

;

F > 0;

which gives the range of feasible F values for the system to yield a real solution as F <F = hence, we have that e ef e eh = 15 [(390 + 480w) 23 M] > 0:
2

(13 + 16w)

;

We can then readily see that

as

@e ef @M

@e eh @M

and

@M @F

@e ef 5 = (313 + 225w) @F 23

@2e ef = @w@F

< 0. The e¤ect of w on e ef is not as straightforward; however, noting that 2250 4166 (13 + 16w) + 115(173 + 160w)F 28 1 <0 M3

@e ef @M @e eh >0< =5 @M @F @F

we can conclude that

When comparing e ef with eex eh with eex ef f and e h , we have that e

Critical F and B values

Upon comparison of F F DI with F nr , that is, the threshold levels of F below which the home ...rm engages in FDI when the foreign country adjusts its standard in response to FDI and when it does not, we obtain that F nr where F nr = 342 (7540 + 6957w) and F F DI = 40 197635 651572 2298155 2 + w+ w 9 21 49

furthermore, we know that F F nr = 18 422240 + 519829w + 146175w2 23

where F is the largest feasible value of F , as above de...ned, when we consider the possibility of policy manipulation to induce or prevent FDI. We thus derive the marginal e¤ects of w on the two critical F values as well as their di¤erence as @F nr = 18 (422240 + 474009w) @w @F F DI = 60 (123337 + 140250w) @w and @ F nr respectively. Similarly, upon comparison of B F DI with B nr , that is, the threshold levels of B above which the foreign country is better o¤ when FDI occurs when it adjusts its standard in response to FDI and when it does not, we have that B nr where B nr = 4408 551 + 945w + 423w2 and B F DI = 6 1459976 + 2541560w + 1197225w2 7
