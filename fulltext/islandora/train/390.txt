Foreign Direct Investment and Customs Union: Incentives for Multilateral Tari¤ Cooperation over Free Trade

Halis Murat Yildiz April 2, 2010

Abstract We examine the implications of a customs union (CU) on the pattern of tari¤s, welfare and the prospects for free trade when the nonmember ...rm has an incentive to engage in foreign direct investment (FDI). First we show that upon the formation of a bilateral CU, the non-member ...rm has greater incentives to engage in FDI. However, when FDI becomes a feasible entry option for the nonmember ...rm under a CU, member countries have incentives to strategically induce export over FDI by lowering their joint external tari¤. When ...xed set-up cost of FDI is su¢ ciently low, this tari¤ falls below Kemp-Wan tari¤ and CU leads to a Pareto improvement relative to no agreement. Moreover, using an in...nite repetition of the one-shot tari¤ game under a CU, we show that FDI incentive of the nonmember ...rm makes the member countries (nonmember country) more (less) willing to cooperate multilaterally over free trade.

Introduction

Over the last few decades, the proliferation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) has been the visible trend in the international trading system. Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tari¤s and Trade (GATT) permits member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to form preferential trade agreements (PTAs) such as free trade agreements (FTAs) and customs unions (CUs) under which PTA members can grant tari¤ reductions to each other that they do not extend to other WTO members. As per the WTO' s o¢ cial web-site, by December 2008, the WTO had received noti...cation of 421 such arrangements, of which 324 were noti...ed under Article XXIV.1 While FTAs constitute an overwhelming majority of PTAs, the existing CUs involve some of the major economies of the world: for example, the Latin American CU MERCOSUR counts Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay as its members while the EC (27) ­ a CU that extends across both goods and services ­ comprises of most major European economies. As a result, it is important to obtain a better understanding of the factors that give rise to CUs and the e¤ect CUs have on the multilateral trading system. Ever since Jacob Viner (1950)' s classic analysis, the static distortions created by such preferential trade liberalization have received signi...cant attention from economists and policymakers alike. Furthermore, in recent years there has been widespread concern regarding the potential adverse e¤ects of PTAs on the process of multilateral trade liberalization (the raison d' etre of the World Trade Organization (WTO)). Concurrent with the proliferation of PTAs, world economy has also witnessed the largest ever FDI growth both in developing and developed countries. New patterns of globalization have accelerated the internationalization of industries and reshaping of global industrial structure. While PTAs induce signi...cant changes in the patterns of trade and investment,
About 230 such agreements were already in force by December 2008 with the number expected to reach 400 by 2010. Mongolia is the only WTO member that does not participate in any PTA and most WTO members belong to multiple PTAs. Indeed, one even observes major PTAs in discussion with each other regarding mutual liberalization.

the existing literature on PTAs has treated export as the only mode of entry and mostly overlooked the role of foreign direct investment (FDI). PTAs, by eliminating tari¤s among members, lead to an expanded market and thus increase the incentives of nonmember countries'...rms to penetrate into the integrated area via FDI by building a plant in one of the member countries and producing output that will be sold in all member countries'markets.2 Based upon this observation, the present paper examines the case where the formation of a customs union (CU) gives a nonmember ...rm an incentive to engage in FDI in member countries'markets while this incentive does not exist under no agreement.3 What are the implications of a CU on the pattern of tari¤s, welfare, and the prospects for global free trade when a nonmember ...rm has an option to engage in FDI? Under repeated interaction, how does the FDI option a¤ect incentives of member and non-member countries for multilateral cooperation over free trade? To address these questions, we utilize an oligopoly model of intra-industry trade between three countries. In our model, we focus on the scenario where countries are completely symmetric both from e¢ ciency and market size perspectives. Consistent with this scenario, we assume that there exists no externalities arising from FDI both for the host and the source countries. In other words, consistent with the literature, ...rms typically face a trade-o¤ between the ...xed cost of an additional plant in the export market and the bene...t of economizing on tari¤s and trade costs.4 We ...rst derive the Nash equilibrium of a one-shot game with and without FDI option under no agreement and a bilateral CU. When two countries form a customs union, they eliminate tari¤s on each other, and impose a lower tari¤ on the non-member ...rm. This external tari¤ e¤ect is called as the tari¤ complementarity e¤ect (Bagwell and Staiger, 1997). Even though the tari¤ is lower, the non-member ...rm earns lower pro...t from its exports,
Donnenfeld (2003) has highlighted the role of FDI incentives in determining the consequences of regional bloc formation on interbloc and intrabloc trade. 3 Jaumotte (2004) found a positive impact of PTAs on the FDI received by member countries, even more so in the 1990s when such agreements were revived. 4 Markusen (1995) surveyed the theoretical literature on FDI and multinational enterprises (MNE). This literature includes papers by Dunning (1977), Horstmann and Markusen (1992), Markusen and Venables (1998).

because the member ...rms expand their output in each others'markets. It follows that the non-member ...rm has greater incentives to engage in FDI following the formation of CU. We show that, when there exists no externalities attached to FDI activities, member countries have incentives to strategically induce export over FDI by lowering their joint external tari¤ if FDI becomes a feasible entry option for the nonmember ...rm under a CU. When ...xed set-up cost of FDI is su¢ ciently low, this tari¤ falls below Kemp-Wan tari¤ (1976) and CU leads to a Pareto improvement relative to no agreement. Then, we examine the in...nite repetition of the above one-shot game under a bilateral CU and examine the incentives of countries to multilaterally cooperate over free trade. Multilateral tari¤ cooperation over free trade is modeled as a stationary repeated game where cooperation can be sustained only if it is incentive compatible for all countries.5 In these models, cooperation is self-enforcing in the sense that each country balances the current bene...t of deviating from free trade against the future losses caused by the breakdown of multilateral cooperation that results from its defection. We show that when the nonmember ...rm has no FDI incentives, member countries are less willing to cooperate multilaterally over free trade than the nonmember country so that the non-member country' s incentive is binding for the multilateral cooperation over free trade. On the other hand, when the non-member country' s ...rm has an incentive to engage in FDI and multilateral cooperation breaks down, member countries internalize the potential FDI threat and lower their external tari¤s on nonmember' s export forever (while the nonmember country switches to its MFN. Therefore, the cost of defection to the nonmember country falls whereas it rises for member countries and thus the nonmember country (member countries) has (have) stronger (weaker) incentive to defect from cooperation since CU' s external tari¤ gets lower. As a result, we argue that the non-member ...rm' s FDI incentives make the member countries (nonmember country) more (less) willing to cooperate multilaterally over free trade.

Basic Model

We develop an oligopoly model of trade with three symmetric countries: z = i, j , k and two goods: x and y . Good x is produced by a single pro...t-maximizing ...rm in each country at a constant marginal cost c in terms of the numeraire good y . Preferences over the two goods are quasilinear: Ui (xi ; yi ) = u(xi ) + yi (1)

Furthermore, u(xi ) is assumed to be quadratic so that the demand curve for good x is linear in each country: pi (xi ) = X
z

xzi

(2)

where xzi denotes the output sold by country z ' s ...rm in country i while xi is the total output X xzi . sold in country i: xi
z

We examine a three-stage game under two trade regimes: no agreement hf gi and a

bilateral customs union hfij gi. In the ...rst stage, countries simultaneously choose their optimum tari¤s. Then, ...rms decide whether to serve foreign markets via export or FDI. Finally, ...rms compete in Cournot fashion. We obtain the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) by backward induction.

2.1

No Agreement hf gi
1 if a ...rm makes FDI 0 if a ...rm exports

We use an indicator function to di¤erentiate the export and FDI equilibrium: If =

In the export equilibrium (If = 0), we restrict our attention to symmetric tari¤s based on Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause where ti denotes the tari¤ imposed by country i. By contrast, when a ...rm makes FDI (If = 1), it avoids bearing tari¤ costs but has to pay an exogenous plant-level ...xed cost F in each of the two countries. Firm i' s e¤ective marginal cost in country j equals: cij = c + tj [1 If ], for all i 6= j 5 (3)

Then, pro...t of ...rm i in country j ' s market can be written as:
ij

= xij pj (xj )

cij xij

If F , for all i 6= j

(4)

First order conditions (FOCs) for pro...t maximization are pj + p0j xij = cij , for all i 6= j (5)

The above FOCs together with an analogous condition for the local ...rm can be easily solved for equilibrium output levels and pro...ts:
ii

= x2 ii ,

ij

= x2 ij

If F , for all i 6= j

(6)

Welfare of country i is de...ned as the sum of its domestic surplus and total export pro...ts: Wi where Si u(xi ) pi xi +

In the export equilibrium (If = 0), since markets are segmented, strategic independence of trade policies obtains. Thus, country i' s tari¤ choice problem reduces to: maxSi

2.2

Customs Union (CU) hfij gi

In the export equilibrium (If = 0) under CU hfij gi, member countries (i and j ) impose a common external tari¤ tu on the nonmember while simultaneously eliminating tari¤s on each other. Due to symmetry and market segmentation, member countries solve maxSi (tu ) +
tu ji (tu )

(13)

and the optimal tari¤ is: tu = 5( 19 c) (14)

When countries form a CU, member countries'export increases while that of non-member countries decreases. Thus, compared to hf gi, CU members'incentives to impose a tari¤ on the non-member decrease since it becomes less important source for rent-extraction: tu < ti . In other words, tari¤ complementarity e¤ect obtains (see Bagwell and Staiger, 1997). In contrast to hf gi, nonmember ...rm (k ) can engage in FDI under hfij gi by building only one plant within the borders of CU and servicing the entire market freely with the goods produced in this plant. Let
u k

F >F . The above proposition indicates that the emergence of a CU increases the incentives of nonmember ...rms to serve the bloc via FDI. Note that this occurs even when member countries lower external tari¤s (tu < ti ), so that the increase in FDI incentives is not necessarily due to tari¤ jumping.

Welfare Implications of a CU

In exploring the welfare implications of a CU, we examine two distinct cases.

3.1

No FDI Incentives: F

When F

F holds, ...rms prefer export to FDI under both hfij gi and hf gi. Let Wzu and

Wz denote the welfare of country z under hfij gi and hf gi. It is easy to show that countries always have an incentive to form a CU: Wiu 71 Wi = 19 c 10

>0

(17)

while nonmember country (k ) is worse o¤:
u Wk

Wk =

(18)

Thus, when export is the only feasible mode of entry, the formation of a CU makes multilateral free trade less (more) desirable to member (nonmember) countries in a static framework.

3.2

FDI Incentives under a CU: F > F
u

u

F

When F

> F

F

holds, the nonmember ...rm (k ) is tempted to evade tari¤s via FDI

under hfij gi while it still prefers export to FDI under hf gi. So far, we have assumed that member countries'optimal tari¤s are not a¤ected by the nonmember ...rm' s incentive to engage in FDI. However, by selecting appropriate tari¤s, member countries can in uence the equilibrium mode of entry to their markets. To this end, we distinguish between the standard optimal tari¤ tu levied by member countries under hfij gi where only export is
f considered and tf u where the FDI incentives exist. The latter optimal tari¤, tu , internalizes

the potential threat FDI exposes and is set just below the critical tari¤ level that prevents FDI by a nonmember ...rm:

(19)

where @tf u = p @F 3 ( 4 c)2 8F > 0 and tf u tu (20)

Intuitively, when F gets smaller, FDI incentives become stronger and thus optimal tari¤ of a CU should be lowered in order to induce export over FDI. The latter part of (20) argues that the nonmember ...rm' s FDI threat limits the e¤ectiveness of CU' s ability in levying tari¤s and thus has a trade liberalization e¤ect. Is it optimal for member countries to induce export over FDI? Relative to the case where FDI is accommodated, tf u enables members to raise their pro...ts and capture tari¤ revenue. These two e¤ects are found to dominate the harmful impact of tari¤s on consumers'surplus: hp i ( c) ( c)2 8F ( c) + 19F Wiu (tf Wiu (If = 1) = >0 (21) u) 36 Proposition 2: When F

F

holds, (i) it is optimal for CU members to

induce the nonmember ...rm to engage in export (rather than FDI); (ii) CU leads to Pareto improvement if F 2F where F > 2F

Moreover, when F = 2F holds, CU' s external tari¤ equals Kemp-Wan tari¤ (1976), denoted by tKW , at which a CU improves the welfare of its members relative to hf gi without making the nonmember country worse o¤: tf u =t

Multilateral Cooperation under a CU

Next, we analyze the in...nite repetition of the above one-shot tari¤ game under CU and examine the incentives of countries to multilaterally cooperate over free trade. Similar to the existing literature, multilateral tari¤ cooperation over free trade is modeled as a stationary repeated game where cooperation can be sustained only if it is incentive compatible for all countries. In these models, cooperation is self-enforcing in the sense that each country balances the current bene...t of deviating from free trade against the future losses caused by the breakdown of multilateral cooperation that results from its defection. Countries sustain cooperation via trigger strategies so that defection by any country results in a permanent trade war wherein all countries revert to their initial tari¤s. Similar to Saggi (2006), we assume that CU is permanent by nature so that members retain zero tari¤s on each other even if cooperation breaks down. To tie our results with the existing literature, next we examine the case where there exists no FDI incentives. 10

4.1

No FDI Incentives: F

F

u

Suppose each country employs a zero tari¤ until someone defects, in which case cooperation breaks down with the nonmember country switching to its MFN tari¤ tk forever while mems export. Hereafter, let m denote member countries: ber countries impose tu on nonmember' m = i; j . Defection from free trade bene...ts the defecting nonmember country by increasing its domestic surplus via the ability to impose optimal tari¤ tk . Thus, one period bene...t from defection for a nonmember country equals Bk (ij ) = Wk (tk = tk ; tm = 0) 1 3( c) Wk (tz = 0) = 10 4
2

>0

(25)

On the other hand, defection by member countries leads to an increase in domestic surplus as well as in export pro...ts: Bm (ij ) = Wm (tk = 0; tm = tu ) 1 5( c) Wm (tz = 0) = 38 4
2

>0

(26)

This implies that under symmetry, if countries were to completely discount the future payo¤s, the multilateral tari¤ cooperation would not be feasible. Now consider the per period cost of the breakdown of cooperation: Ck (ij ) = Wk (tz = 0)
u Wk

(27) (28)

u Cm (ij ) = Wm (tz = 0) Wm =

>0

In order for tari¤ cooperation to be self-enforcing, the one period bene...t from defection must be less than the discounted life-time cost of defection since defection leads to permanent multilateral trade war. In other words, the incentive compatibility (IC) constraint must hold for each country as follows: Bz (ij ) where denotes the discount factor and

(29)

Cz (ij ) measures the trade war' s life-time cost of

Proposition 3: When F

obtains. Thus, multilateral cooperation

over free trade is sustainable if and only if

The above proposition suggests that when the nonmember ...rm has no FDI incentives, member countries are less willing to cooperate multilaterally over free trade relative to the non-member country so that the member country' s choice determines whether multilateral cooperation over free trade is sustainable.

4.2

FDI Incentives: F > F

u

F

f f (ij ) denote the per period bene...t and cost of defection when the nonLet Bz (ij ) and Cz

member ...rm has FDI incentives. It is important to note that members still impose the unrestricted tari¤ (tu = tu ) in the defection period. Thus, bene...ts from defection stay the same as in (25) and (26):

f Bz (ij ) = Bz (ij ) for all z = i; j; k

(31)

Once multilateral cooperation breaks down, member countries internalize the potential FDI threat and lower their external tari¤s on nonmember' s export forever (tf u tu ) while the

nonmember country switches to its MFN tari¤ tk . Therefore, the cost of defection to the nonmember country falls whereas it rises for member countries:
f Ck (ij ) f Ck (ij ) while Cm (ij )

Cm (ij )

(32)

The following is immediate from (31) and (32): Proposition 4: FDI incentive of the nonmember ...rm makes the member countries (nonmember country) more (less) willing to cooperate multilaterally over free trade: and
f m m. f k k

12

We know from (30) that
f m

=

m

>

f k

=

k

when F = F

u

(33)

As represented by ...gure 2, when F gets lower, the nonmember country (member countries) has (have) stronger (weaker) incentive to defect from cooperation since CU' s external tari¤
u gets lower ( @t > 0): @F f

@ f @ f k < 0, m > 0 @F @F

(34)

In other words, nonmember country has an incentive to free ride on trade liberalization undertaken by CU members without having to liberalize in return.

When we evaluate

f k

and

f m

at F = F :
f k

>

f m jF =F

(35)

Given inequalities (33), (34) and (35), there must exist a critical threshold F below which
f k f m

holds and thus nonmember country' s choice becomes binding for the sustainability

of cooperation:
f k

>

f m

i¤ F

F where F > F 13

u

F

(36)

Finally, since

@ m @F

= 0 and

f k

>

m jF =F

, it is immediate to argue that

f k

>

m

obtains

when F < F holds. Therefore, the nonmember ...rm' s FDI incentive makes multilateral cooperation over free trade harder to sustain when F is su¢ ciently low : F < F .

Conclusion

Ever since Jacob Viner (1950) ...rst drew attention to the issue, the economics of preferential trade agreements such as Customs Unions (CUs) has received intense scrutiny from economists and policy-makers alike. While PTAs induce signi...cant changes in the patterns of trade and investment, the existing literature on PTAs has treated export as the only mode of entry and mostly overlooked the role of foreign direct investment (FDI). CUs, by eliminating tari¤s among members, increase the incentives of nonmember countries'...rms to penetrate into the expanded market (integrated area) via FDI. Given the recent proliferation of PTAs and the large growth in FDI activities, it is important to understand the static and dynamic implications of PTAs on the trading system when FDI is an alternative mode of entry to export. To this end, we present a model where the formation of a CU gives the nonmember ...rm an incentive to engage in FDI while this incentive does not exist under no agreement. Under such a case, we show that CU members have incentives to strategically induce export over FDI by lowering their joint external tari¤s. When ...xed set-up cost of FDI is su¢ ciently low, this tari¤ falls below Kemp-Wan tari¤ (1976) and CU leads to a Pareto improvement relative to no agreement. This is an important result since non-member country is always worse-o¤ under a bilateral CU when export is the only mode of entry in serving foreign markets. Then, using a game of repeated interaction, we examine how the FDI option a¤ects the incentives of member and non-member countries for multilateral cooperation over free trade. We ...nd that, when FDI option is available, the nonmember country (member countries) has (have) stronger (weaker) incentive to defect from cooperation due to lower external tari¤s of a CU. This implies that the non-member ...rm' s FDI incentives make the member countries 14

(nonmember country) more (less) willing to cooperate multilaterally over free trade.
