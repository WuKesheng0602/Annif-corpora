Abstract-A 0.8 V folded cascode amplifier was designed in 0.18-pn standard CMOS technology. Emphasis was placed on observing the low voltage design and using current driven bulk (CDB) technique to achieve this goal. The CDB technique was introduced as a method for low voltage design by reducing threshold voltage. This design achieves 141dB DC gain, 56Mhz 3dB band width and 65GHz gain hand width, which is the working condition of pipeline ADCs. Index Terms - low voltage, ultra-low voltage operational amplifier, current driven bulk

I . INTRODUCTION
Technology scaling is driving the supply voltages of digital circuits down to 1.2V by 2004 and to 0.9 V by 2008, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association's road map [l]. At the same time, the migration toward System-On-a-Chip (SoC) adds pressure on the analog circuits to follow that trend [2]. There are several approaches to ultra-low voltage supply circuit design which have recently been described; e.g., based on charge pumps [3], bulk drive [4], floating gates [SI, limited commonmode range input circuits [ 6 ] , [7], negative conductance [8] or CDB technique [9]. We can see the CDB technique, which is used as a method for compensating body effect [9], as means of reducing the threshold voltage in some transistors. In this paper, we look to how CDB technique can reduce the threshold voltage in a standard CMOS process, and we use the reduced threshold voltage transistors to implement a 0.9-V folded cascode operational amplifier with compatible input- and output levels. Section II gives an overview of CDB technique. Section 111 includes the design consideration of the folded cascode operational amplifier. Simulation results and measurements are presented in Section VI and finally conclusion is made in Section V.

Q F : Fermi potential The CDB technique [9] targets the absolute value of V,, . We show, here, that technique is also

applicable tn transistors, which have no body effect; i.c Vss=O. Replacing this in equation ( I ) yields = V,hO

As this becomes evident, the bulk bias voltage does not play a significant role in threshold voltage. Our explanation for effectiveness of CDB technique is as follows. The relationship between threshold voltage and acceptor concentration (NA) in NMOS can he expressed using the following equations:

Injecting a current into the bulk in NMOS would change the acceptor concentration (NA), which in turn, causes a decrease in the threshold voltage of NMOS. Same understanding is valid for PMOS and donor concentration by extracting an electron from hulk. In reality, the turn-on phenomenon is a gradual function of the gate voltage, making it difficult

to define Vth clearly. In semiconductor physics, the Vthof an NMOS is usually defined as the gate voltage for which the interface is "as much ntype as the substrate is p-type." This definition cannot directly indicate whether the device is "on" or "off."[lO] The drain current however can clearly indicate, whether the device is "on" or "off." To calculate the threshold voltage we used I-V characteristic, as follows:

Fig.2 shows I-V characteristic for transistor with and without bulk injection. The dotted curve is for a transistor without the bulk injection and with VGs=375 mV. This transistor is in the offmode. This transistor would be in on-mode when Vas= 470mV, as shown by dash-line in Fig.2. The solid line corresponds for a transistor which has lower VGs=375mV, but with bulk injection (1,njcct=5nA), although the VGs of the latter transistor is smaller. Using eq. (6) one can calculate the threshold voltage as the following example shows. The transistor is in on-mode. However, one should appreciate the reduction in threshold voltage by approximately IOOmV, using CDB technique.

According to [9] there are some disadvantages in CDB technique such as Output Impedance, Low Frequency Pole-Zero Pair and Slew rate.

111. CASCODE AMPLIFIER
The typical folded-cascode amplifier is commonly preferred for high frequency applications since the parasitic capacitance and the transconductance of the folding transistor determine the non-dominant pole of this amplifier [ I I]. This configuration has two advantages: 1) high voltage gain 2) large bandwidth due to less Miller effect [IO]. Fig. 4 shows OUT amplifier, which is a standard folded cascode amplifier

Fig.4: Schematic Diagram with CDB transistors. Due to the concept of the CDB method, which is based on current bulk driven, we are injecting current into the circuit. In such a low voltage-design, it is an advantage to operate the cascading transistor in subthreshold, as that makes it easier to generate the bias voltages; however, it is not critical. The other transistors should work in strong inversion mode. as good matching gives the lowest overall offset error. The limited' gain achievable in folded-cascode configuration has motivated the invention of gain-boosting techniques. These techniques are usually applied to cascade operational amplifiers to increase their gain with little degradation in speed [12],[13]. Transistor (MI,) plays a gainboosting role in our design.

method of reducing threshold voltage in any transistor and we designed an ultra-low voltage folded cascade, gain-boosted operational amplifier using CDB technique. At 0.8 volts power supply, it has a dc gain of 141 dB, 5OMHz bandwidth and 56GHz gain bandwidth. This design is usable for pipeline ADCs. This design was made possible by CDB technique as a new method of reducing threshold voltage of transistor.
