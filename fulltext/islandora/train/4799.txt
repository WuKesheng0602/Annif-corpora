Abstract: In the last decades, several studies have revealed how critical the urban heat island (UHI) effect can be in cities located in cold climates, such as the Canadian one. Meanwhile, many researchers have looked at the impact of the city design over the urban microclimate, and have raised concerns about the development of too dense cities. Under the effect of the "Places to Growth" plan, the city of Toronto is experiencing one of the highest rates of building development in North America. Over 48,000 and 33,000 new home permits were issued in 2012 and 2013 respectively, and at the beginning of 2015, almost 500 high-rise proposals across the Greater Toronto Area were released. In this context, it is important to investigate how new constructions will affect the urban microclimate, and to propose strategies to mitigate possible UHI effects. Using the software ENVI-met, microclimate simulations for the Church-Yonge corridor both in the current situation and with the new constructions are reported in this paper. The outdoor air temperature and the wind speed are the parameters used to assess the outdoor microclimate changes. The results show that the new constructions could increase the wind speed around the buildings. However, high-rise buildings will somewhat reduce the air temperature during day-time, as they will create large shadow areas, with lower average mean radiant temperature.

1. Introduction In the last decades, several studies have revealed how critical the urban heat island (UHI) effect can be in cities in cold climates, such as the Canadian one. This has led many researchers to look at the impact of the city design over the urban microclimate, and in particular, to raise concerns about too dense cities [1]. This study focuses on the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), the largest and most populous metropolitan area in Canada, with over 6 million persons. Toronto population is rapidly growing with new 76,500 persons in the last year, making Toronto the sixth largest metropolitan area in North America in terms of total population with only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago being significantly larger [2]. Moreover, the annual growth over the last year shows that Toronto is not far behind New York and Los Angeles, with a significant dependence in the case of Toronto on immigration as the key driver of population growth. The net immigration in Toronto over the last year was equal to 66,700 persons [2]. In this context, the Toronto urban environment is undergoing huge transformations. The "Places to Growth" is the Toronto development plan originally released in 2005, and reviewed in the following years, which represents the response to the forecast that by 2025 Toronto will house additional 2.4 million persons [3]. Under the effect of this plan, Toronto is experiencing one of the highest rate of building development in the developed countries. Over 48,000 and 33,000 new home permits were issued in 2012 and 2013 respectively, with 470 high-rise proposals across the

GTA released at the beginning of 2015 [2,3]. In this regard it is important to mention that the Canadian urbanization rate is above 80%, and as a result the urban comfort and urban energy demand represent national priorities [4]. This trend is similar to that occurring in many other countries [4,5]. Given the large transformation that Toronto is facing in its urban design, and the amendments to the Official Plan housing policies which allow high-rise buildings almost everywhere around the city, it seems important to investigate how the urban design will influence the outdoor thermal comfort in Toronto and, consequently, the building energy consumption. Akbari suggested that every 0.6  C increase in air temperature resulted by the UHI effect can add 1.5% to 2% to the peak demand for cooling, with many health consequences too [6]. Moreover, in Toronto, the peak demands increase the use of electricity supplied by local coal burning power plants, and consequently they have significant environmental implications. In Toronto, days with temperatures above 30  C are expected to increase from an average of 13 nights per year in the 1970s to 65 by the end of this century [7,8]. Tam et al. (2015) stressed the evidence of the UHI in Toronto in by looking at the effect on a day to day temperature change between urban and rural areas [8]. Evaluating the relationships between buildings and the surrounding outdoor environment for controlling the urban microclimate and for mitigating the UHI effect is a multidisciplinary task which requires competences in many subjects, including landscape, urban planning, architecture, and building material science [8]. In view of the negative UHI effects, many researchers have focused on UHI mitigating strategies by simulating single blocks or neighbors [1,8]. However, preliminary results have shown the importance of urban design on the microclimate of outdoor spaces and urban canopy layers [9­12]. In fact, the urban density plays an important role for the UHI effect, since a denser urban form results in multiple reflections of solar energy, and influences the air convection within the urban canyons as well as the wind "porosity" of the city [13,14]. As a result, a denser morphology influences the radiant heat loss within the urban canyons due to the lower sky view factor (SVF). In fact, tall buildings and narrow urban canyons reduce the SVF and increase the amount of shaded area at the ground level, keeping the bottom of urban canyons cooler than the surrounding area by day, but increasing its temperature at night time [15­17]. Computer models have shown that an urban form with a building height to street width around 0.5 and a building density around 0.3 should be promoted to mitigate outdoor discomfort and other UHI effects [18]. However, the height of new construction in Toronto shows trends far from these geometrical design ratios. Bosselmann et al. back in 1995, presented an extensive study of how the change in the urban from of downtown Toronto was going to affect sunlight on sidewalks and open spaces as well as the wind conditions at street level [19]. By making wind tunnel measurements, they found that wind significantly accelerates above 10 m/s among several high-rise towers, creating both wind chilling effects and mechanical forces on the pedestrians that can make unsafe to walk. Mesoscale CFD studies have demonstrated that wider streets could induce easier go-through winds. However, the higher flow rate along the main streets reduces the flow rates in parallel narrower streets, negatively affecting the ventilation efficiency [20,21]. Moreover, the design of building facades also effects the urban wind environment [22]. Long building facades which are parallel to the prevailing wind direction, can accelerate horizontal vortex airflow at the edges [23]. Similarly, deeper urban canyons increase the wind speed [24]. Therefore, although the effects of the new constructions on urban wind environment depend on the construction location and the building facade design, it is evident that the development of high-rise buildings in Toronto is creating deeper urban canopies, while narrowing the relative street widths. The researches about thermal remote sensing are based on satellite measurements (2-D data) or aircraft scanners (2-D data). In particular, land surface temperatures (LST) maps derived from satellite data are the most commonly used ways to demonstrate the extent of the UHI effect in cities [25,26]. Natural Resources Canada used air temperature and surface temperature measurements collected from satellite imagery and 30 stationary stations to characterize the microclimatology across the GTA [27]. Although the UHI was most readily detected at night and when local winds were weak [27], an element that emerged in all the satellite elaborations was that downtown Toronto showed lower

surface temperatures than more peripheral suburban area [28]. In fact, in downtown, although the high density of high-rise buildings surrounded by hard and dark surfaces would probably suggest higher surface temperatures, it has emerged that suburban areas within the GTA also experienced higher thermal admittance properties, as common in downtown city centers. Moreover, it was demonstrated a strong relationship between the gross building coverage and the mean wind velocity ratio. In this sense, it was shown that the greater density of high-rise buildings in downtown Toronto could be responsible for creating vertical thermal drafts, with more releases of heat into the air [28]. Although Sustainability 2016, 8, 822 3 of 11 the advantage of using LST is the possibility to cover extensive spatial area and to investigate the UHI in a macro-scale, 2-D LST data have their limitations on spatial resolution and the expression of suggest higher surface temperatures, it has emerged that suburban areas within the GTA also urban typologies.

Simulations started at 21:00 and lasted two days in order to have enough microclimate data. The study conducted in this paper was less sensitive to the proper assessment of the albedo of the different surfaces in the studied area, as the main goal was to look at the impact of new buildings that are going to substitute vacant parking lots. In every numerical model, especially 3D models such as the ENVI-met ones, simulations often suffer reliability at their model borders and at the grids very close to them. Nesting grids could be added in the boundary of models for increasing the authenticity of the simulation results. However, the more nesting grids are used, the lower is the chance that numerical problems occur because one or more of the model bounder are interfering with internal model dynamics. In this research, 10 nesting grids on each side of model boundaries were added in the simulation models. Simulation Validation Figures 3 and 4 show the validation of the ENVI-met model through a comparison between field measurements and simulation results for a summer day of the air temperature (Ta) [33]. The measurements data were derived from the governmental weather station data base. The maximum Ta difference between the simulations and the measurements at the airport was around 3.8  C and occurred at 04:00 of 17 July. Reversely, the maximum Ta difference between the simulation and the measurement at the city center weather station was around 3.5  C, and occurred at 04:00 of 17 July. The average difference between the simulations and the measured results was 1.3  C. This discrepancy could be explained by inaccuracies in the simulation input for surface materials, soil, and vegetation conditions. In fact, the univocal values for the material properties used in the simulated model represents a clear discrepancy of the simulation model. Looking at the scatter plots in Figure 4, the coefficient of determination (R2 ) between the simulation and measurements is 0.75 to 0.88 for the measurements in the city center and in the airport area respectively.

The assessment assessment of the change change in in the the human human thermal thermal comfort comfort before before and and after after the the constructions constructions The of the requires some discussion. In fact, although several studies have have recently appeared, a lack requires somepreliminary preliminary discussion. In fact, although several studies recently appeared, of a general framework for assessing the outdoor thermal comfort exists. In fact, a number of a lack of a general framework for assessing the outdoor thermal comfort exists. In fact, a number of biometeorological indices have been developed to describe human thermal comfort by aligning local biometeorological indices have been developed to describe human thermal comfort by aligning local microclimate conditions conditions and and human human thermal thermal sensation sensation [34].

The Physiologically fluxes, as well as the personal body energy balance, and their variability. The Physiologically Equivalent Equivalent Temperature (PET), a human thermal comfort index based on the Munich energy-balance Temperature (PET), a human thermal comfort index based on the Munich energy-balance model for model for individuals (MEMI) was assessed in this study [35]. PET is defined as the air temperature individuals (MEMI) was assessed in this study [35]. PET is defined as the air temperature at which, at which, in a typical indoor the setting, the human is maintained thetemperature, skin temperature, in a typical indoor setting, human energy energy budgetbudget is maintained by theby skin core core temperature, and sweat rate equal to those under the conditions to be assessed. PET is temperature, and sweat rate equal to those under the conditions to be assessed. PET is particularly particularly suitable for outdoor thermal comfort analysis as it translates the evaluation of a complex suitable for outdoor thermal comfort analysis as it translates the evaluation of a complex outdoor outdoor environment climatic environment to aindoor simplescenario indoor scenario on a physiologically equivalent basis that climatic to a simple on a physiologically equivalent basis that can be can be easily understood.

4. Conclusions The urban climate in downtown Toronto before and after new constructions are simulated and compared. The results show that the new constructions may increase the wind speed and decrease the surrounding air temperature by up to almost 1  C during the day, with negligible effects during the

night. It is also clear that the fact that the wind speed changed after the new constructions is strongly related to the air temperature changes. Moreover, the mean radiant temperature will be significantly reduced after the new towers are completed. Overall, it seems that the new high-rise constructions could somewhat reduce the UHI effect in summer mid-days. The verification of the result of this research using measurement campaigns of the outdoor microclimate for the city of Toronto before and after new tower-type buildings, is the object of current studies. Finally, further studies should be carried out to focus on more detailed scales of analysis, in order to investigate in detail the effect of the final building forms for both the outdoor comfort and the urban walkability.
