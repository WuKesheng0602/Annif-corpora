Effects Of Ibuprofen And Tetracycline On Extracellular Polymer Production  

Brian Hanna 
Master of Applied Science, Environmental Applied Science and Management  Ryerson University 2016 

ABSTRACT 

Extracellular polymer substances (EPS) comprised of proteins, carbohydrates, and other  biomolecules, are important for microbiological communities. The EPS provides benefits to  wastewater treatment communities (WWTC) such as antibiotic resistance, and community  structure.  Therefore EPS can be viewed as a valuable health marker of WWTC and therefore it  is important to determine effects of contaminants entering wastewater treatment plants  (WWTPs) on EPS. WWTC were exposed to the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)  Ibuprofen at 16 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL, and the antibiotic tetracycline at 50 ng/mL to determine  how EPS and growth were affected. EPS was analyzed using high performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC), Bradford protein analysis, and Anthrone carbohydrate analysis. It was  determined that EPS content was lower at both Ibuprofen concentrations, enhanced with  tetracycline, and comparable to control when both were present. Changes could not be linked  to protein or carbohydrate concentration. Growth inhibition occurred in the presence of both  drugs but not each individually, suggesting that Ibuprofen may increase tetracycline sensitivity  through EPS inhibition.

1. Introduction In large urban areas, Canadian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are responsible for treating as much as 150 Mega litres per day of raw sewage. The main purpose of these  plants is to remove organic waste in the form of nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus before the  effluent is released into the surrounding environment. These treatment plants are however  receiving many different types of pollutants that they were not originally intended to handle,  such as antibiotics, hormonal drugs, and personal care products. As time goes on more drugs  will be introduced into the environment, many which may have unintended consequences. As a  result, it is important to reduce usage, improve degradation and elimination, and study the  effects of the drugs on the wastewater treatment process.  This research will focus on the  effects of tetracycline and Ibuprofen on the secondary treatment process in the WWTPs. This is  especially important when you take into consideration that increasing amounts of  pharmaceuticals are entering WWTPs each year as exemplified by the fact that Canadian sales  of prescription drugs increased by $12 billion between 2006 and 2011 (Guerra et al., 2014).  Recent studies show that the residues of many of these pharmaceuticals, designed to  act upon cellular processes in humans, show toxic effects in the environment. For instance a  group of drugs called Azoles used to clinically treat fungal infections have been shown to have a  causal relationship to a reduction in egg numbers in female fish (Celander, 2011). In addition to  having an effect on its own, Azoles in combination with benzenes, toluene, ethylbenzenes, and  xylenes (BTEXs) causes greater bioaccumation of said BTEXs (Celander, 2011). In another study  with a mixture of the NSAID (nonsteroidal antiinflammatories, NSAID) diclofenac and other 

1 

   

drugs, it was shown that the reproductive age of water fleas was significantly reduced, and the  fecundity increased (Vasquez et al., 2014). Changes within algae have also been seen, where  mixtures including Ibuprofen and antibiotics induced quantitative changes in proteins involved  in photosynthesis (Vasquez et al., 2014). These examples show that individual drugs alone and  in combinations can have unintended side effects at all levels of the trophic system.   While extreme care is taken in preventing harmful drug interactions in humans, it is  impossible to prevent these drug interactions in a wastewater treatment scenario, where each  of these drugs can have many differing effects on gene expression, metabolism, changing levels  of ions, etc. (Vasquez et al., 2014). Furthermore, combinations of drugs may produce additive  or synergistic effects that have not been studied yet. Additive here refers to an effect equal to  the sum of the effects seen when the individual drugs are examined, and synergistic being an  effect greater than both combined.  Numerous different drugs may be found in the influent water of treatment plants, such  as NSAIDs (Deblonde et al., 2011; Irsch, 2003; Lishman et al., 2006; Pasquini et al., 2013;  Verlicchi et al., 2012), antibiotics, lipid regulators, and hormonal drugs (Avella et al., 2010;  Deblonde et al., 2011; Irsch, 2003; Michael et al., 2013; Pasquini et al., 2013).  While the  cumulative effect of all these compounds is interesting, preliminary studies need to assess the  effect of individual drugs before studying drug mixtures. This study will focus on the effect of  two drugs, tetracycline and Ibuprofen, from two different pharmaceutical groups, antibiotics  and NSAIDS respectively. These drugs were chosen primarily for the wealth of supporting  research already available, as well as their ubiquitous use in human and veterinary medicine. 

2   

   

Ibuprofen was also chosen in order to further examine some novel effects seen when  wastewater communities were exposed to it, namely its ability to inhibit the production of one  of the community's defense and structural components (known as extracellular polymer  substances, EPS).   Furthermore, studying the effect of these two drugs together should provide insight into  how these communities cope with drug combinations, as well as how the presence of one drug  can enhance or inhibit the effect of the other.  This can provide information that can later be  analyzed to determine the EPS products produced and determine what specific components are  linked to greater survival of the community.   The goal of this research is to study the effect of tetracycline and Ibuprofen on the  microbial populations of a wastewater secondary treatment system by measuring the effect on  growth and the concentration and composition of EPS produced in the presence of these two  pharmaceuticals.  Examining current literature suggests that Ibuprofen inhibits the EPS  production in bacteria thereby reducing their protective layer while antibiotics such as  tetracycline have been show to increase EPS production (Avella et al., 2010; Pasquini et al.,  2013).  It is hypothesized that Ibuprofen and tetracycline will have opposite effects on the  production of EPS, with Ibuprofen causing inhibition, and tetracycline causing a spike. In  combination it is wondered if the individual effects of the drugs will cancel each other out or be  enhanced in the presence of the other.     
3   

   

Therefore the short term objectives of this research are to measure the:   1) Effect of tetracycline or Ibuprofen alone or in combination on the growth of a model  organism, Psuedomonas putida BBC443  2) Effect of tetracycline or Ibuprofen alone or in combination on the growth of a wastewater  microbial population  3) Effect of tetracycline or Ibuprofen alone or in combination on the production of EPS and  soluble microbial products (SMP) in a batch reactor system  The EPS and SMP was measured and quantified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography  (HPLC) and Bradford and Dubois assays were used to determine the changes in protein and  carbohydrate concentrations respectively. These methods were chosen for their nondestructive  nature, ensuring that results measured were minimally affected by cell lysis.

2. Background  2.1. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)  Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) come in many shapes and sizes, from lagoons  used to treat wastewater in small towns (Hoque et al., 2014), to large plants capable of treating  over 150 million liters per day (City of Guelph, 2009). Population growth, urbanization, and  increased access to treatment systems mean an increase in global effluent loads over the next  fifty years, with nitrogen and phosphorous effluents alone expected to rise from 6 to 17 million  tons, and 1.3 to 3.3 million tons respectively (OECD, 2012).  While the processes behind WWTPs are expected to become more efficient, this  increased efficiency is not expected to be on par with increased nutrient rates (OECD, 2012).  What this means is that barring other types of contaminants entering WWTPs, the plants will be  enduring increasing challenges to remove xenobiotics in the coming years; something that  needs to be taken into consideration when determining how to deal with the new  contaminants and their effects on the processes that occur within these plants. This is  especially important, considering that WWTPs are often the only treatment processes for  sewage before it is released into the environment. If they are incapable of removing  contaminants, this could lead to a positive feedback loop where incoming contaminants can  have greater effects.     

5   

   

2.1.1. Purpose of WWTPs  The main purpose of a WWTP is the removal of macropollutants such as organic matter,  nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended solids (Pasquini et al., 2013). The total load of these  contaminants is expected to almost triple within the next 50 years (OECD, 2012), putting stress  on already aging infrastructure.   WWTPs usually consist of primary, secondary, and sometimes tertiary treatment.   The primary treatment stage consists of physical removal of solid materials from the  wastewater and this stage is common to most wastewater treatment systems (Batt et al.,  2007).  It results in the  settlement of suspended solids (referred to as sludge) and the overall  reduction of biochemical  oxygen demand (BOD) of the effluent by at least 20% (OECD, 2012).  The effluent then is transported to the secondary treatment reactors which are   dependent on biological activity of a microbial community to remove dissolved organic  materials (Avella et al., 2010), with an aim of reducing BOD by ~70% and chemical oxygen  demand (COD) by ~75% (OECD, 2012).  Furthermore, many pathogens are removed in this step.    Anaerobic digestion often follows secondary treatment where, under anaerobic  conditions, fermentation of sludge components, production of methanogenic substrates and  methanogenesis occurs.  The advantage is a reduction of sludge produced during the aerobic  processes. 

6   

Finally , tertiary processes can be employed that best suit the geography/contaminants  found in the wastewater, and includes further nitrogen and phosphorus removal, a reduction in  the microbial concentration and removal of organic pollutants with activated carbon filters.   Finally, additional treatments of the effluent before released in the environment can  include ozonation, powdered activated carbon, or ultraviolet (UV) exposure, among others  (OECD, 2012).  2.1.2. Types of WWTPs  There exist many different types of WWTPs, all utilizing the benefits of microbial  degradation. These include lagoon systems, conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane  bioreactors (MBR), and moving or fixed bed bioreactors (MBBR and FBR respectively) (Michael  et al., 2013).  2.1.2.1. Lagoons 

Lagoon based sewage treatment  are pondlike water bodies that are responsible for  receiving and treating wastewater, usually for small municipalities (Hoque et al., 2014). They  are usually implemented due to their low cost to build, operate and maintain, in addition to this  there is some evidence that they are efficient at removing a wide variety of micropollutants  due to the complex processes that occur within the lagoons; however their efficiency in winter  seasons is still under investigation.  

7 

   

2.1.2.2.

Conventionally Activated Sludge (CAS) 

Activated sludge plants are by far the most common types of centralized wastewater  treatment (CAS). They depend on the use of microbiological activity in a highly oxygenated  environment to degrade organic matter (Michael et al., 2013). The sludge produced in these  plants is a mix of living organisms, and the products that they need to survive and are  considered high in nutrients. The sludge can be further processed into biosolids than can be  incinerated for energy or used as agricultural fertilizer (Irsch, 2003; Michael et al., 2013). Due to  the high affinity of many drugs to bind to this sludge, biosolids provide another route of  dissemination for emerging contaminants to reach the environment (K. A. Gilbride et al., 2011;  Guerra et al., 2014; McEneff et al., 2014; Prosser et al., 2015; Zenker et al., 2014).    2.1.2.3. Membrane Bioreactors (MBR)  Membrane Bioreactors are a combination between activated sludge and membrane  filtration technologies, enabling the bacterial flocs to be contained in a small amount of space  (LeClech et al., 2006). They have a smaller footprint than CAS systems, while producing high  quality effluent, disinfectant capabilities, and less biosolid production. However they tend to be  more expensive to maintain, and as time goes on the filters become less effective due to  membrane fouling (LeClech et al., 2006).  2.2. Wastewater Treatment Communities (WWTCs)  Wastewater treatment communities are extremely diverse systems, consisting of archaea,  bacteria, protozoa, metazoan, autotrophs, fungi, archaea, viruses and even predatory  heterotrophs (Lee et al., 1996; MartínGonzález et al., 2006; Moussa et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 
8   

   

2011). From this we can see that these are full ecosystems, presumably at risk to perturbations  due to changing environmental conditions like any ecosystem.  The bacteria in the system are most commonly found in aggregates, flocs, and biofilms  bound by EPS (Lee et al., 1996; Sheng et al., 2010). Typically this biomass consists of ~33% and  14% active bacteria at sludge retention times (SRT) of 30 and 100 days respectively (Moussa et  al., 2005). What this means is that as SRT increases, the growth of bacteria saturates while  sludge volumes continue to increase. This saturation seems to occur at around 40 days where  levels of nitrification, phosphate removal, and predation no longer increase (Moussa et al.,  2005). Low oxygen content, as well as removal of surface proteins can cause aggregates to  deflocculate, which in turn reduces the quality of the final effluent (Miao et al., 2004). This  effect on effluent quality is due to the use of gravity clarifiers which will remove flocs before  effluent is released (Richard et al., 2003). SRTs can vary between plants,  but on average most  plants will manage a SRT of 36 days, with a minority reaching as high as 10 or more days  (Lishman et al., 2006).   The bacterial population plays a very important part of the WWT community since they  remove most of the BOD by metabolizing or degrading the organic matter. Furthermore, In  particular, some bacteria are polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO) (Acevedo et al.,  2014) responsible for most of the phosphate removal, and ammoniaoxidizing bacteria (AOB)  that remove ammonia that is toxic to biota downstream ( Zhang et al., 2011). These groups  remove contaminants in different ways, PAOs are responsible for removing phosphate by  physically storing them in their cells (T. Zhang et al., 2011), while ammonia is removed 

9   

   

chemically by AOBs and nitriteoxidizing bacteria (NOBs) in a twostep process(Acevedo et al.,  2014). Within AOBs there are two main groups of bacteria, the dominant genera being  Nitrosomona, and Nitrosospira (rare due to slow growth rate); these bacteria complete the first  rate limiting step of converting ammonia to nitrite (Zhang et al., 2011). NOBs then oxidize  nitrite to nitrate.    As mentioned before, most of the bacteria are present in flocs and other aggregates, many  however are found free floating on their own in the treatment system which reduces effluent  quality (Lee et al., 1996; MartínGonzález et al., 2006). Thankfully this ecosystem self corrects  this issue with the aid of a wide array of predatory protozoa and metazoan (Lee et al., 1996;  MartínGonzález et al., 2006), among these are different types including ciliated, flagellated,  amoeba, nematodes, and rotifers. This grazing community is known to be susceptible to  contaminants such as heavy metals, however these tests are usually only done with one  contaminant; known interactions between contaminants are few and far between (Martín González et al., 2006). As these organisms are susceptible to bioaccumulation and responsible  for aiding in the removal of free floating bacteria, they have been used as biomarkers for the  overall health of a Wastewater treatment community (WWTC).  2.3. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)  Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) include polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins,  glycolipids and nucleic acids.   It is the term given to the wide variety of compounds produced  by the bacteria that live in close proximity to each other such as in biofilms or dense  populations such as WWTPs. These compounds can make up as much as 50%90% of the total 
10   

   

organic matter in sludge (Avella et al., 2010; Pasquini et al., 2013; Sheng et al., 2010). In  addition to EPS, there is also soluble EPS, otherwise referred to as the soluble microbial  products (SMP) (LeClech et al., 2006; Pasquini et al., 2013).    The over expression of EPS and SMP can be considered signs of stress on the WWTP, as  these substances are released by bacteria and are capable of acting as buffers within the  system against nutrient stress (Pasquini et al., 2013; Sheng et al., 2010). Usually EPS production  is directly related to the growth of the bacteria.  During the exponential growth phase, EPS  content is steadily increasing. Once the stationary phase has been reached EPS production  begins to decrease (Sheng et al., 2010).  2.3.1. Composition of EPS  The composition of EPS is composed of up to 90% proteins and polysaccharides  (Pasquini et al., 2013). In some cases the protein fraction alone can represent as much as 75%,  followed by carbohydrates and DNA (Pal et al., 2008); however humic acids have been found to  account for as much as 20% of the total amount (Sheng et al., 2010). This leaves a very small  amount left for lipids, nucleic acids, uronic acids, and some inorganic compounds. The different  constituents and their ratios found in EPS can vary greatly in their reported numbers. This is due  to a variety of extraction methods, bioreactor types, and tools used to observe the bacteria  (Frolund et al., 1996; Sheng et al., 2010). For example, SMP are defined as the soluble cellular  compounds that may be released by the cell either through diffusion, cell lysis, or purposefully  secreted. As such, if a harsh extraction method is used on the bacteria that could cause the cell 

11   

   

to lyse, reported con ncentrations of SMP can vary even w within the sa ame samplin ng source (Le e Clech et al a ., 2006).  2.3.2. Functions of EPS in WWTPs  In n WWTPs EP PS will cover the surface or be found d within the spaces of microbial  aggregates (Sheng et t al., 2010), which w  indica ates that sub bstrates, or c contaminant ts such  antibiotic cs must pass s through EP PS before the ey can reach h the cell.

As mentioned EPS consists of mostly proteins and carbohydrates, which help make it a  major structural component in biofilms (Pasquini et al., 2013; Sheng et al., 2010). In addition to  its structural characteristics, it serves important roles when it comes to adsorption, and  nutrient consumption for wastewater bacteria.   Due to the variety of proteins and carbohydrates found in EPS, there will be an equally  large variety in functional groups found, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups that can bind  with heavy metals and other contaminants (Ha et al., 2010; Joshi et al., 2009; Pereira et al.,  2011; Sheng et al., 2010). This is also not an insignificant effect as studies have shown that floc  is capable of absorbing as much as 60% of BTEX contamination (Sheng et al., 2010). In these  cases it was shown that the BTEXs were adsorbed mostly to the EPS itself, and not to the  bacterial cells. This is an important example that shows the benefits of EPS produced by  wastewater bacteria in being able to sequester harmful contaminants that could otherwise  leave treatment plants in the effluent.  The EPS produced by the bacteria can be used by other bacteria as food sources, as  enzymes required for the breakdown of the proteins and carbohydrates are found in high  abundance in WWTPs (Sheng et al., 2010). Notable that this can tapped into in times of stress,  however it is also seen that degradation of EPS can lead to a loss of quality in the effluent  flowing out of WWTPs. This again shows the importance of maintaining healthy EPS production  in these microbial communities.

2.3.3. EPS Extraction Techniques   Determining the constituents of wastewater sludge can be done using a variety of  methods, however differing methods will provide different results due to factors such as   disruption of exopolymers, and promotion of cell lysis (Frolund et al., 1996).  In particular, any  method that causes cell lysis to occur would affect the results, as it would be difficult to  differentiate between the internal and external components of the cells. Therefore a method  must be chosen carefully to minimize the likelihood of cell lysis.  The best method found in the literature for this purpose is the use of a Cation Exchange  Resin (CER). The method detailed by Frolund (1995) utilizes a resin through which chemical and  physical processes strips away the EPS from the cells in the activated sludge. It does this by  removing cations that keep the EPS together, such as calcium and magnesium (Sheng et al.,  2010), and through shearing processes that occur when the mixture is being spun.  Not only does the method prove to be less likely to cause cell lysis, but it also enables  twice as much EPS proteins and carbohydrates to be extracted than other methods such as  heating to 80oC or the  sodium hydroxide method (Frolund et al., 1996). The CER method has  been used successfully by many others in the analysis of EPS (Avella et al., 2010; Pasquini et al.,  2013), and has become the standard for EPS extractions (Sheng et al., 2010).  2.4. Emerging Contaminants  There is no solid definition for the term "emerging contaminants"; different authors will  provide their own. In general terms, however, they can be thought of as contaminants that are 

14   

   

seeing a rising interest in research. Even if they have been present in the environment for  several decades, such as Ibuprofen, the drug may be classified as an emerging contaminant  (Metcalfe et al., 2014; Osachoff et al., 2014; Stuart et al., 2012). The US EPA defines emerging  pollutants as new chemicals without regulatory status and which impact on environment and  human health that are poorly understood (Deblonde et al., 2011).  Scientific research has shown that pharmaceuticals that have been measured in the  environment are mostly in the ng/Lµg/L range (Vasquez et al., 2014), and as such acute toxicity  does not play a large factor when assessing risk to human health (Hughes et al., 2013; Michael  et al., 2013). However concentrations are definitely believed to be environmentally detrimental  as we are seeing chronic effects in organisms exposed to these contaminants, such as fish and  invertebrates (Kim et al., 2007; Mudgal et al., 2013; Sanchez et al., 2011), and many  contaminants are known to accumulate in the tissues of these organisms along with plants  (Zenker et al., 2014).  Over 270 known pharmaceuticals are already detectable in the environment, with several  being found in concentrations that are harmful to aquatic life as high up in the trophic level as  large fish (Hughes et al., 2013; Pasquini et al., 2013; Sanchez et al., 2011; Zenker et al., 2014).   Three to four thousand of these are drugs being produced in quantities of over 1,000,000  pounds a year, with over 700 new industrial chemicals  being introduced each year (EPA, 2007;  Petrie et al., 2013; Woodruff et al., 2011).  A main source of pharmaceutical contaminants in wastewater systems is due to both  human and veterinary use, and excretion after use (Mudgal et al., 2013). Before even discussing 
15   

   

contamin nation due to excretion post ingestio on, it is impo ortant to rea alize that un nused medicinal  products s can accoun nt for as muc ch as 8% of all a  medicatio on sold for human use (M Mudgal et al l.,  2013), am mong these are left over r products fo or the treati ng of cardiovascular disease, asthm ma,  the nervo ous system and, a  of course, antibiotic treatment ts. In the cas se of agricult tural use,  antibiotic cs are comm monly used as a  prophylact tics in order r to prevent illness (Land ders et al., 2012).  

 
Figure 2 Possible P  pathway ys to water syst tems as a result  of medical use (Mudgal et al., 2 2013) 

 

While e the previously mention ned unused category ac ccounts for a significant proportion o of  these con ntaminants, by far the greatest g  sour rce is from e emissions aft ter use through animal o or  human waste w  (Mudg gal et al., 201 13). Once a dose d  has bee en administe ered as muc ch as 90% of will  be excret ted as an act tive substan nce in the uri ine (Alcock e et al., 1998; Holtz, 2006), while fece es  can also contain as much m  as 75% % depending on the drug g (Mudgal et t al., 2013). A According to o one  study wh hich analyzed d over 200 human h  pharm maceuticals, , 64% of eac ch was excreted in urine, , and 
16   

   

35% in feces (Lienert et al., 2007). However the products released from excretion were highly  variable, for example, on average 42% of active substances were released as metabolites. In  some cases the resulting intermediates can vary greatly, such as with Amoxicillin where, 80 90% is released unchanged whereas with Carbamazepine only 3% is released unchanged  (Lienert et al., 2007).   The effects of these contaminants should be of great concern, especially since many of  them enter wastewater treatment facilities on their path to the environment. Possible  emissions pathways related to medicinal products can be seen in Figure 2.   In this environment there can be hundreds to thousands of different chemicals in influent  water (Osachoff et al., 2014) that need to be removed.  Since WWTPs were not designed to  eliminate these compounds, their direct effect on the functioning of the microbial community  within the system needs to be examined in great depth.  2.4.1. Removal Rates in WWTPs  Simply attempting to increase biodegradation in wastewater plants isn't enough, as  some compounds are not susceptible to biodegradation, likewise elimination through the use  of adsorption to biosolids is not sufficient to guarantee transfer into wastewater sludge  (Pasquini et al., 2013). For antibiotics and many personal care products (PCPs), removal has  been documented to be around 50100%. Specifically, NSAIDs where removed at around 60%  with the exception of Ibuprofen which sees removal rates near 75100% (Deblonde et al., 2011;  Fent et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2014; Metcalfe et al., 2014) and diclofenac with far lower removal  rates (<30%) (Deblonde et al., 2011; Michael et al., 2013). Antibiotics are removed at various 
17   

rates with tetracyclin nes being reported from m 12 to 100% % removal (D Deblonde et al., 2011;  Michael et e  al., 2013).   It t can be seen n that there are extreme ely large var iations in removal rates for these dr rugs,  which can be attributed to WWT TP processes s, geography y, communit ty composition, and seas sonal  changes where drugs s such as Ibu uprofen and carbamazep pine are found in higher r concentrat tions  during th he fall (Hoqu ue et al., 201 14). Regardle ess of the fac ctor, it show ws a clear dif fference in  removal rates from one o  drug to the t  next, even within th he same class of pharma aceutical. The ere  are also some s  unique e drugs such h as sucralos se is not deg raded at all in most syst tems (Hoque e et  al., 2014; Pasquini et t al., 2013). This T  shows that t  there m may be a futu ure need to d determine h how  to remov ve these con ntaminants from our wat ters, as som e are extrem mely persiste ent.  2.5. Ibuprofen 

(Brozinski et al., 2013 3) 
Figure 3 St tructure of Ibup profen 

In the e UK alone over o  22 millio on prescriptions are wri tten every y year for NSA AIDs, and ove er 70  million in n the United States (Russ sell, 2001). Ibuprofen sp pecifically ca an be prescri ibed for chro onic  condition ns such as rh heumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis, a nd other nonrheumato oid  arthropathies. Treatm ment usually y lasts 9010 00 days with  high dosage e and regula ar medical  attention n (Moore, 20 007). Data is much harde er to find in  Canada, but t could be es stimated at 
18 

   

~10million a year based on populations sizes and prescriptions in the two previously mentioned  countries. It should be noted that these numbers only pertain to prescribed doses, and that  over the counter sales of Ibuprofen and other drugs are likely to represent a greater share of  the total doses worldwide (Mudgal et al., 2013).   Ibuprofen is a propionic acid derivative, to deal with general pain in the body (Moore,  2007). It does this by binding to cyclooxygenase (COX) as many other NSAIDs do (McGettigan et  al., 2013; Moore, 2007; Russell, 2001; Yin et al., 2014), however COX can be found in two forms  (COX1 and COX2) which many NSAIDs will indiscriminately bind to. COX1 is responsible for  general upkeep of many aspect of the body such as production of prostaglandins that regulate  processes such as gastroenterological protection, blood flow, kidney functions, and more  (Russell, 2001), COX2 on the other hand causes pain and inflammation. The inhibition of COX2  is the goal of NSAIDs, however many unintended side effects may arise due to unwanted  inhibition of COX1. While Ibuprofen also inhibits COX1, it is extremely popular not only due to  low cost but due to the fact that it has a short halflife of 12 hours (Moore, 2007). As a result of  this short halflife Ibuprofen can be consumed for acute pain, and be 99% removed from the  body after only 816 hours, serving the purpose of treating pain without extended COX1  inhibition.   2.5.1. History  In 1983, Ibuprofen became the very first prescription NSAID to be made available over  the counter due to a very high safety record. In the UK it was marketed under the brand name  Nurofen, however, once available in the USA in 1984, it was marketed under the brand name 
19   

   

Advil. The maximum OTC allowance is set to 1200 mg per day, however when it is prescribed  the dose can increase to between 1200 mg and 3600 mg per day (Moore, 2007). Currently it is  one of the top most used pharmaceuticals around the world due to its low cost and  effectiveness, with usage in the US as high as 2,300,000 Kg per year (Gilbride et al., 2007). With  sales of this drug expected to increase between 56% per year in the US, the total load of this  drug is only expected to rise (Limited, 2012). This already high use, partnered with its  ubiquitous nature, makes Ibuprofen a great candidate for further research, especially  considering any novel effects it might have in WWTPs.  2.5.2. Removal Rates and Psuedopersistence  In 2014, a Canadian study showed that Ibuprofen could be found with 100% frequency  in Canadian WWTPs. The concentrations found in the influent water ranged from between  2500 ng/L and 45,000 ng/L, with removal rates of up to 90% (Guerra et al., 2014). This is in line  with what is seen in studies from other parts of the world (Miège et al., 2009; Pasquini et al.,  2013; Stuart et al., 2012). However it is still significantly higher than what may be found in  European countries such as Germany, where concentrations of the drug can be as much as 8x  lower (Irsch, 2003). This suggests that the WWTP bacteria are indeed capable of breaking down  large quantities of Ibuprofen.  However, due to a constant influx from the sewer systems,  concentrations remain high on a day to day basis causing the drug to be pseudopersistent.  Furthermore, the Canadian study also showed that Ibuprofen could be found in 100% of bio  solid samples (Guerra et al., 2014).

2.6. Tetracycline T  

(Nelson, 20 002) 
Figure 4 Str ructure of Tetrac cycline 

Tetra acycline is a broad scale e antibiotic group g  consist ting of sever ral antibiotic cs: Doxycycline,  Clomocycline, Minoc cycline, and Tetracycline T e among oth ers (Mudgal l et al., 2013 3) which can  oth prokaryo otic and euka aryotic cellular processe es, and is eff fective again nst parasites, ,  target bo fungi, and bacteria (N Nelson, 2002 2). All tetrac cyclines shar re the same mode of act tion in bacte eria,  the inhib bition of prot tein synthesis by binding g to the 30S ribosomal s subunit, ther reby preventing  binding of o  aminoacyltRNA (Mud dgal et al., 20 013). The wiide range of f targets for t this antibiot tic  make it very v  relevant t in the cont text of WWT TPs, as it has s already bee en discussed d how they a are  home to extremely diverse d  comm munities of microscopic m  organisms. Around 257 75% of  tetracycline antibioti ics are excre eted into the e environme nt through u urine and feces in their  original form f  (Pan et t al., 2015).   2.6.1. Histor ry  Tetr racycline wa as first discov vered in 194 47 by Benjam min M. Dugg gar, a scientist who was  searching g for new an ntibiotics pro oduced natu urally by bact teria. In this s case he disc covered the first 

21   

   

broad spectrum antibiotic Tetracycline from soil bacteria Actinomycetales (Nelson, 2002).  Today it is one of the most frequently detected groups of antibiotics found in wastewater all  across the globe (Michael et al., 2013).  According to an EU study the median concentration of  tetracyclines in natural waters is roughly a factor of 10 below the hazardous concentration  (1.30 µg/L) for 5% of species (HC5), with the exception of Oxytetracycline  which is found at a  median concentration of 1.34 µg/L (Mudgal et al., 2013). However this is only a median  concentration and detections are often found that are above the predicted no effect  concentration (PNEC) when all assessments are applied. Combined these data suggest that the  tetracycline family are already a potential risk to the aquatic environment; before taking into  account the cumulative effect of the different groups, something which can't be ignored as they  all have the same mode of action to bind the 30S subunit.  In terms of human health concerns it cannot be ignored that the persistent presence of  tetracycline as well as any other antibiotic adds to the risk of antibiotic resistances developing.  This factor should be considered even if tetracycline concentrations are not viewed high  enough to directly affect human health.  2.6.2. Removal Rates and Pseudopersistence  Depending on the geographical location, tetracycline can be found in influent water at  concentrations between 35 ng/L to 50,000 ng/L or higher, with removal efficiencies between  12100% (Michael et al., 2013). According to a study on the environmental risks of medicinal  products by the European commission, tetracycline has been found at concentrations as high  850,000,000 ng/L in wastewaters, with the median being 370 ng/L (Mudgal et al., 2013). The 
22   

   

removal efficiency is dependent on original concentration, as well as the detection methods  used at the individual wastewater treatment plants. However removal rates of metabolite  compounds are not as easily measured due to a wide variety of derivatives being available. In  fact, metabolites of one drug can sometimes be found at concentrations 3 times as high as their  parent compounds (Zhang et al., 2014). The main method of removal for tetracyclines is  sorption into sludge, this is due to how easily it can bind to calcium and other ions that may be  found in EPS (Michael et al., 2013).  2.7. Global Policies  Each region has its own policy for the handling of environmental contaminants, however  these policies vary greatly in many factors such as what are considered contaminants, the  testing required, what constitutes dangerous levels, and to whom the burden of proof is placed.  A few things that appear to be common among Europe (EU), the United States (US), and  Canada (CA) are:   All drugs are regulated on an individual basis (Holtz, 2006; Klaper et al., 2011).   This means that the interaction with other compounds is not taken into account  when regulation limits are determined.     They do not account for biomagnification, instead there is a heavy emphasis on  acute toxicity (Klaper et al., 2011)   Most protections are placed on drinking water, especially in the US, neglecting  the WWTP completely (Klaper et al., 2011). This means that very few regulations  on removal efficiencies of emerging contaminants have been implemented. 
23   

   

In terms of regulation between Europe, the US and Canada, there seems to be a very  clear ranking of strictness when it comes to regulation, whether or not these differences are  significant is not clear. The EU places first, USA second, with Canada being the least restrictive.  The reason that the EU places first is mainly due to policies that force companies to perform  acute toxicity testing on all new drugs, their possible metabolites, and even the capsules that  the drugs will be packaged in (Holtz, 2006). It is worth mentioning that EU policies were made  with consultation by Canadian scientists, indicating that similar policies may be implemented in  Canada in the near future. It should also be noted that this is testing only for drugs intended for  human use.  There is a two tier testing guideline for the drugs in the EU, with tier A looking at aquatic  fate, including within sewage sludge. This tier A guideline is designed to determine the drugs  predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) within the environment. This testing only comes into  play if the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) is over 0.01 µg/L of pharmaceutical, or  if the drug is an endocrine disruptor. If it is found that the PEC is greater than the PNEC, then  tier B testing is done that further examines risk as well as looks at which drugs metabolites are  performed. If the PEC is less than the PNEC, then the environmental assessment is concluded.  Within the USA there is similar policy being drafted, however the PEC required to start  testing is 10x higher at 0.1 µg/L of pharmaceutical. The PEC is calculated based on the  estimated sales and dosages of the drugs. In Canada, however, there is no such policy in effect  yet, although the EU policy was created with the help of Canadian scientists (Holtz, 2006).  Instead Canadians have what is called an In Commerce List (ICL) which contains three 

24   

   

mandatory items; CAS name, CAS registration number, and the alternate name, however, with  no information available regarding how it would be used, chemical structures, or estimated  annual volumes (According  to https://www.ec.gc.ca/inre nwri/default.asp?lang=En&n=C00A589F1&offset=11&toc=show). Environment Canada lists  their first task as to obtain accurate identification of each substance, and the basic information  needed to determine potential hazards. Canada states that there will be special attention given  to mixtures of unknown composition, which accounts for 50% of the ~9000 items on the list. Of  that, they claim, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products account for 83% of all new substance  notifications they receive.  2.7.1. Gaps in Knowledge  Currently most research is done on the direct effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment  and is conducted using only one compound at a time (Fent et al., 2006; Vasquez et al., 2014).   However, even in the case of singular drug compounds not all modes of action are known, even  in human targets, and much less in lower taxa (Fent et al., 2006; Vasquez et al., 2014). There is  also a strong bias towards examining the acute effects of these drugs as opposed to the chronic  effects (Fent et al., 2006). In addition to this, there is a lack of information showing effects of  mixture of medicinal products by themselves and in combination with other organics such as  endocrine disruptors (Mudgal et al., 2013).  There is quite a bit of information regarding the effects of certain mixtures on bacteria and  zooplankton, however even in these cases, the mixtures are overwhelmingly done with the  same group of pharmaceuticals (Vasquez et al., 2014); Meaning that the research looks at 
25   

   

groups of several antibiotics, or NSAIDs, as opposed to a large variety of different groups. In  cases where antibiotics and NSAIDs were combined, changes in fertility, protein regulation,  were observed (Vasquez et al., 2014). In one interesting case it was noted that there was a 17%  shift in sex ratio towards male Hyalla (Borgmann et al., 2007) in the presence of 7 common  pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, Ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid,  and triclosan. While it was the only significant effect seen in that case, it was observed at  environmental concentrations (10100 ng/L) and it goes to show that drugs can have wildly  different effects in secondary targets that cannot be inferred from human trials.  As well it can be shown that some drug/taxa combinations are completely neglected. A  metastudy which analyzed articles regarding over 270 chemicals and 40 countries found that  there were no studies done examining the effects of antibiotics on fish, antidepressants on  aquatic plants, or cardiovascular drugs on bacteria, within the studies that they analyzed  (Hughes et al., 2013).   2.8. Pharmaceutical Mixtures   2.8.1. Conceptual Questions Vs. Environmental Relevance  When determining the `how to design' an experiment to test the effect of  pharmaceuticals, it is important to choose whether you want to answer conceptual questions  or focus on environmental relevance. A meta study (2014) categorized the difference between  these two kinds of studies that have been seen in the literature (Vasquez et al., 2014). Studies  that aimed to answer conceptual questions tend to be pushing high concentrations of a few  pharmaceuticals in order to observe effects on a specific mode of action. On the other hand, in 
26   

   

order to determine environmental relevance, studies looked at the concentration of between 4  and 12 pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations. In general it was harder to  perform data analysis on studies aiming to be environmentally relevant due to the wide variety  of contaminants and concentrations.  In addition to categorizing these different types of experiments, the study also laid out  the types of cocktail experiments previously completed. What was noted was that in most  cases when a study used a cocktail, it represented only one type of drug, such as several  different antibiotics (Vasquez et al., 2014; Wunder et al., 2013).  When experiments were done  with various groups of drugs, the research is rare and never studied the effect on bacterial  populations in WWTPs.  2.8.2. Previous Links Between Ibuprofen and Tetracycline  According Wong et al. 1984, a combination of Ibuprofen and Tetracycline was found to  have statistically better results in treating acne than either of the drugs alone, or a placebo  (Wong et al., 1984). A follow up study also found that this result could be replicated with  minocycline, another antibiotic (Funt, 1985). In addition to these cases, a study from Actis et al.  (2014) found that patients who took NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen could suffer from negative side  effects relating to the gastroenterological setting (a system heavily reliant on bacterial activity)  (Actis et al., 2014).  While this may not be directly related to wastewater treatment processes, it does show  an interesting link between NSAIDs and a stronger response to antibiotics; an important factor  being looked at in this research. 
27   

   

2.9. Research Objectives  This study will aim to determine the effects of Ibuprofen and Tetracycline alone or in  combination on WWTC; Characteristics being analyzed are growth rate, EPS and SMP, and  proteins and carbohydrates.   HPLC will be utilized in order to determine profiles of EPS produced. Proteins and  carbohydrates will be quantified using the colorimetric assays Bradford BSA and Anthrone  Method respectively.                        
28   

   

3. Materials and Methods  3.1.  Bacterial strains   The bacterial strain Pseudomonas putida BBC443 was used as a reference strain for the  growth and HPLC tests.   It was grown and maintained on 100% LB agar plates until needed.  3.2. Wastewater samples  The samples were collected from the Toronto Humber Wastewater Treatment plant.   Samples (500 ml) were obtained from four of the aeration tanks, mixed and transported to the  lab for immediate use.  Once in the lab samples were centrifuged at 4500x g for 10 mins, and  the pellet resuspended in LB broth twice in order to wash the sample of contaminants that  could be found in the wastewater. This LB solution was used to seed the samples used in the  experiment.  3.3. Test compounds  Two test compounds were selected.  Tetracycline (SigmaAldrich) was selected to represent  antibiotics and Ibuprofen (Life Brand) to represent NSAIDS.  Concentrations used were 50 ng/ml  tetracycline, and 16 ng/ml, 100 ng/mL Ibuprofen. The concentrations chosen represented  environmentally relevant amounts found in wastewater for tetracycline (Avella et al., 2010) and  Ibuprofen (Pasquini et al., 2013). A second higher concentration of Ibuprofen was also tested to  verify results previously described (Pasquini et al., 2013) In addition to this, mixtures of the  compounds were examined as well.   
29   

   

3.4. Growth Inhibition Tests  Growth inhibition tests of wastewater treatment community were carried out at 30oC  with shaking in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of LysogenicBroth (LB Broth). Growth  was measured both in the presence of each compound and in combination at various  concentrations (16 ng/mL ­ 100 ng/mL Ibuprofen, and 50 ng/mL tetracycline).    A reference growth inhibition test was carried out using P. putida. The bacteria were  pregrown in LB medium overnight to an OD600 reading of ~2.5. Cultures were then diluted  1:100 in warm LB medium supplemented with the various concentrations of the compounds  and growth was monitored at 30oC for P. putida and 25oC for the wastewater sample. Growth  was measured at OD600 over a 24 hour period.   3.5. EPS Extraction and Analysis  To measure the effect of the compounds on EPA production, samples of the cultures were  collected at 12 hour growth.  The biomass was separated from the supernatant by  centrifugation (15 min at 4500g). The supernatant containing Soluble Microbial Products (SMP)  was directly analyzed and the settled biomass was subjected to EPS extraction using a DOWEX  resin (Frolund et al., 1996), an extraction time of 4 hours was used (Avella et al., 2010; Pasquini  et al., 2013). The resin was first rinsed in a prepared PBS buffer (2 mM Na3PO4, 4 mM NaH2PO4,  9 mM NaCl, and 1 mM KCl at pH 7), after which the EPS previously centrifuged was  resuspended in equal amounts of buffer.  This sample was then magnetically stirred for 4 hours  in an ice bath, after which the resin was removed via centrifugation. The remaining solution  contained the EPS macromolecules. 
30   

   

The EPS and SMP samples were analyzed using High Pressure Size Exclusion  Chromatography (HPSEC) according the procedures used by Avella (2010) and Pasquini (2013).  A Perkin Elmer series 785 UV/Vis detector, equipped with a Zorbax Bio series column (GF250,  25 cm x 4.6 mm, Agilent Technologies) at room temperature was used. The mobile phase was  NaCl 0.2 M with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection was carried out at 215 nm. Prior to  injection, all samples were filtered with 0.45 um filters.  Calibration was performed with a protein standard (5730 to 670 kDa, SigmaAldrich,  France). This was compared to standards found in literature for proteins and carbohydrates on  the same column using the same flow rates and mobile phase. EPS was extracted in duplicate,  and each extract injected in duplicate using an injection volume of 10 µL.  3.6. Protein Quantification  Protein quantification was done using Bradford Protein Standard 96 well plate technique. A  standard curve was plotted using 8 known concentrations of BSA ranging from 0 to 125 mg/mL.  Samples and standards were measured at 595 nm in a 96 well plate, each well containing 20 µL  of standard/sample and 200 µL of Bradford reagent. The SMP samples were analyzed directly  after first centrifugation, while EPS samples were analyzed after being treated with the CER.  The BSA standards were prepared as detailed below in table 1

3.7. Carbohydrate Analysis    Carbohydrate testing was done using the colorimetric Anthrone Method. Anthrone solution  was prepared by adding 0.5g of Anthrone to 10 ml of EtOH, this was then added to 250 ml 75%  H2SO4. The samples of EPS and SMP were then placed on ice. In vials solutions were made  consisting of 1mL sample, 2 mL H2SO4, and 4 mL Anthrone Solution. The vials were then heated  to 100oC for 15minutes before being measured at 578 nm.  3.8. Analysis ­ Calculating the Area of the Chromatograms 
 

The produced chromatograms compared based on shape, size, and location of peaks  recorded. The areas under the curves of the graphs were also compared against each other in 

32   

   

order to determine if there was a significant difference in concentrations of each relative peak  from one sample to the next.   The areas of the graphs were calculated with the aid of an open source image editing  software called GIMP 2 using the following method. First the total units2 of all graphs were  calculated, secondly all pixels in the graph where recorded using the histogram feature. From  these two values the pixels/unit2 of the graphs could be calculated. Finally the pixels under the  lines of the chromatograms were measured; from here the unit2 of the graph could be  calculated. The full equation used can be seen below   
(Pixels under Chromatogram)  Area in Unit2 of Chromatogram =  (Total Pixels in graph / (X axis units * Y axis units))   

A visual demonstration can be seen in Appendix C.  3.9 Statistical analysis
  

3.9.1 Sample Characteristics 

A ShapiroWilk's test (p>0.05) (Shapiro et al., 1965) and a visual inspection of normal Q Q plots and box plots was performed in order to determine if the chromatogram areas were  normally distributed or not among the control groups, Tetracycline groups, Ibuprofen groups,  and groups containing both Ibuprofen and Tetracycline. 

33   

      

3.9.2 ANOVA analysis 

Comparative analysis was done using single factor ANOVA tests in order to determine if  there was any statistical difference between the groups of contaminants tested. Following this  multiple Ttests with modified Bonferroni corrections were used to determine if the statistical  difference between individual groups was significant.     The ANOVA tests were carried out on the total areas of the chromatograms that were 

calculated using the method in 3.8  A list of ANOVA tables and Bonferroni corrected ttests can be found in appendix C.

4. Results and Discussion  4.1. Summary of Results and Discussion  It was observed that Ibuprofen and Tetracycline had opposite effects on the production of  EPS by WWTC. Tetracycline was viewed as a stressor and as a result led to a significantly higher  concentration of EPS produced; Ibuprofen on the other hand had the opposite effect of  lowering the amount of EPS detected.  In both cases the individual contaminants did not illicit  an inhibition in the growth rate of the WWTC; however when both were present in the same  sample there was a significant decrease in the growth rate as compared to the control even  when measured EPS was not significantly different that found in the control sample. The results  show that significant effects can already be seen in WWTC when exposed to contaminants at  environmental concentrations, and just as importantly that when two contaminants at  "harmless" concentrations are examined in combination there may be significant impact on the  WWTC. 
4.2. Growth Inhibition Tests 

Xenobiotic compounds are often found to affect the growth of organism either directly or  indirectly (Avella et al., 2010). In this study, the effect of tetracycline and Ibuprofen on growth  was tested both on an antibiotic sensitive strain of P. putida (BBC443) and a WWTP bacterial  community.  A comparison of growth rate or overall biomass production was used to assess the  effect on growth. 
4.2.1.  Pseudomonas putida BBC443 

35   

   

Figure 5 shows the growth of P. putida in the presence of various concentrations of  Ibuprofen and Tetracycline. Under control conditions the bacteria reached maximal growth  within 12 hours with a maximum OD600 of 2.4.  In the presence of Ibuprofen at either  concentration P. putida showed no observed difference in growth rate or overall biomass when  compared to the control sample without Ibuprofen.  In the presence of tetracycline, however,  there was a noticeable decrease in both the growth rate and overall biomass (OD=1.7).

Figure 5 Growth rate of Pseudomonas putida measured in OD600 when exposed to varying concentrations of the  contaminants Ibuprofen and Tetracycline 

Since P. putida does not carry a resistance gene to tetracycline it was expected that it  would not grow in the presence of tetracycline.  However the concentration used (50 ng/mL)  represents an environmentally relevant concentration found in wastewater and is below the  minimum inhibitory concentration.  These results here suggest that although the concentration 
36   

   

does not completely inhibit the growth of the organism it still causes an effect as shown by the  decrease in biomass after 12 hours. Furthermore, cultures of P. putida grown in the presence of  mixtures of Ibuprofen and Tetracycline did not differ when compared to those of tetracycline  alone. For the purpose of this discussion "inhibitory concentration" refers to a concentration  that would prevent any growth.  Overall, tetracycline, even at sub inhibitory concentrations, affected the growth of the  tetracycline sensitive strain of P. putida.  However, Ibuprofen, at both concentrations showed  no effect on the growth of the organism.   
4.2.2.  Wastewater Treatment Community 

Growth inhibition tests were then performed on the total microbial community of the  WWTP. As with the reference strain of P. putida, Ibuprofen did not inhibit the growth of the  total community either.   However it was observed that tetracycline also did not negatively  impact the growth or the biomass production. This observation suggests that the community  mostly likely contained tetracycline resistance organisms, and they may be responsible for  maintaining the rate of growth of the entire community.   According to several studies the fact that WWTPs are the final destination of  wastewater, from hundreds to thousands of households, as well as dozens of hospitals, they  provide a perfect environment for the evolution of antimicrobial resistance that may be later  spread to the environment (Coutu et al., 2013; Michael et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014).  Antibiotic resistance could also spread within the community due to horizontal gene transfer,  so that even if a certain species of bacteria does not individually develop resistance it can be 
37   

   

gained through the process of plasmid transfer (Schlüter et al., 2007).  Subinhibitory  concentrations of antibiotics therefore could contribute selective pressure on maintaining  antibiotic resistance genes in the community, although they do not cause an overall decrease in  biomass production.   Interestingly, although neither Ibuprofen nor Tetracycline alone caused a decrease in  the overall growth of the community compared to the control, when they were both present  together a slight but significant decrease in growth rate was observed at 12 hours as shown in  Figure 6.

Figure 6 Growth rate of Wastewater Community measured in OD600 when exposed to varying concentrations of the  contaminants Ibuprofen and Tetracycline 

 This significance was determined by a lack of overlap between the standard deviation  error bars that were calculated. This reduction in growth rate only when both contaminants 
38   

   

are present could be due to additive effects caused by the combination of compounds, even if  they do have different modes of action.  
4.3. Extracellular Polymer Substances 

As already mentioned EPS is a vital component of a healthy bacterial community, providing  structure, nutrition, and antibiotic resistance mostly due to physical characteristics such as  diffusion coefficients (Pasquini et al., 2013; Sheng et al., 2010). Also as the EPS is responsible for  most of the adsorption of other contaminants such as heavy metals and BTEXs, disruption in  normal EPS production can have unseen adverse effects on the community. Thus observing  changes in EPS is a vital part of gauging the health of the community.   
4.3.1.  Chromatograms 

Chromatography is a method for determining the size of substrates within a solution; in  this case it is being used to determine the size of proteins and carbohydrates found within the  samples of our WWTC exposed to the contaminants Ibuprofen and Tetracycline. All of the  chromatograms shown below were exported into text files then into Excel for easier  comparisons. Raw chromatograms for each group can be seen in Appendix A. The protein  standards graph can be found in Appendix B. 
4.3.1.1. Control vs Tetracycline 

Figure 7 shows the chromatograms from the control and the community exposed to 

tetracycline.  Comparing the shapes of the control chromatogram vs the shape of the 50 ng/mL  tetracycline chromatogram it can be noted that both contain a sharper peak at approximately  2.5 3.5 mL elution volume and a second spread out peak at approximately 4 4.5 mL elution 
39   

   

volume, a sharper peak is defined here as a peak that had a higher absorbance value over the  same time period versus another peak. This sharpness indicates a greater concentration of  macromolecules in the sample tested.

Control 50 ng/mL Tetracycline

 
Figure 7 Chromatogram of Extracellular Products when wastewater community is exposed to 50 ng/mL of Tetracycline  compared to control, measured at 215 nm 

The first peak represents the larger molecular weight EPS fraction while the smaller less  intense peak represents lower molecular weight EPS material.  The first and most obvious  comparison to be made is in the height of the first peak, where the sample exposed to  tetracycline shows a significantly higher absorbance.  

40   

   

This peak corresponds to proteins in the 130 kDa to 400 kDa range according to the  protein standards, and carbohydrates around 200 kDa in size according to the literature (Avella  et al., 2010; Pasquini et al., 2013). The increase in peak height in the presence of tetracycline  was expected as previous studies showed that other antibiotics had elicited an increase in EPS  material.    The second peaks correspond to proteins and carbohydrates in the sub 5 kDa range. In 

previous studies the second peak containing the smaller macromolecules had higher  absorbance than the first peak, however we have noted a smaller one; the concentration used  previously was 10 mg/L which is 200 fold higher than the concentration of 50 ng/mL used in this  study. In our case the reduction of smaller forms of EPS may be due to more EPS remaining in  the larger fraction when the community is exposed to the tetracycline.    Overall, these results show that tetracycline does indeed cause the bacterial community 

to produce more EPS when exposed to an antibiotic, indicating that even though it does not  cause growth inhibition (Figure 6) it still results in a change in the response of the community.    An increase in EPS when exposed to a stressor such as the antibiotic tetracycline makes 

sense due to the decreased diffusion coefficient of EPS vs water (Avella et al., 2010; Pal et al.,  2008; Pasquini et al., 2013; Sheng et al., 2010). In other words, in order for the bacteria to  protect itself from this contaminant it may require a greater barrier to act as a first line of  defense.   
4.3.1.2. Control vs Ibuprofen 

41   

   

Chromatograms in Figure 8 represent EPS production with and without Ibuprofen at 16  ng/mL and 100 ng/mL. Ibuprofen at either concentration gave a significantly different profile  from the control although there was no significant difference according to ANOVA and  Bonferroni corrected ttests between the two Ibuprofen concentrations (Fig. 8). In this case the  communities exposed to Ibuprofen produced less EPS that was slightly lower in molecular  weight (optimal elution at 3 mL verse 2.8 mL). This was determined with the aid of molecular  weight standards, which can be seen in Appendix B, the longer it takes for a compound to elute,  the smaller its molecular weight.  Only one previous study observed the effects of Ibuprofen on EPS in  WWTC  communities (Pasquini et al., 2013), however, in that case the minimum concentration tested  was 100 ng/mL, while we have observed this effect at 16 ng/mL.  This lower concentration  represents concentrations of Ibuprofen detected in wastewater treatment systems around the  world (ranges between 2500 ng/L and 45,000 ng/L (Guerra et al., 2014)). This is the first study  to demonstrate that environmentally relevant concentrations of this NSAID cause changes in  WWTC structure. This is an unexpected result as there is no known mode of action for  Ibuprofen on prokaryotes (the main constituent of WWTP communities and producer of EPS),  since the main target of Ibuprofen is the inhibition of COX2 (and unintentionally COX1) which  are eukaryotic proteins.

A recent study  that suggests NSAIDs (Carprofen, Bromfenac, and Vedaprofen) may  inhibit DNA replication by preventing the binding of DNA polymerase III, however Ibuprofen  was not one of the three tested NSAIDs examined in that study (Yin et al., 2014) and further  research would be needed in order to establish any links. Further research would be required in  order to determine if Ibuprofen has the same affect at the three previously mentioned NSAIDs,  or if there is some other mechanism in action. 
4.3.1.3. Control vs Tetracycline + Ibuprofen Combinations 

In this study, a combination of tetracycline and Ibuprofen was also tested on the WWTC,  something none of the previous studies had performed. When observing the chromatograms 

43 

   

in Figure 9 it appears at first glance that there is a significant difference between the control  group and the groups containing both contaminants.

Figure 9 Chromatogram of Extracellular Products when wastewater community is exposed to combinations of Tetracycline  and Ibuprofen compared to control, measured at 215 nm 

However even though ANOVA analysis determined that there was variance between all  sample groups tested, post hoc Bonferroni determined that there was no significant difference  between the groups in Figure 9. This was an interesting result since both compounds  individually caused effects in EPS structure but together appeared to cancel out the effects.   Furthermore, the lack of difference in EPS structure between the control and the  community exposed to both compounds was not reflected in the growth curves seen in Figure 6  where we noted a significant difference between the growth rate of the samples exposed to  both contaminants and the control. It appears that the growth rate of the WWTC is affected by 

44   

the combination of the two contaminants yet the change in the production of EPS was  negligible.

Figure 10 Chromatogram of Extracellular Products when wastewater community is exposed to Ibuprofen, Tetracycline, and  Combination compared to each other, measured at 215 nm 

The effect of the contaminants on the WWTC is most effectively demonstrated when  the chromatograms of EPS produced when the community was exposed to tetracycline alone,  Ibuprofen alone, or to both, are displayed side by side for the purpose of comparing the  differences between the groups.   As seen in Figure 10 there is a significant difference between all three groups when  compared to each other. The community exposed to tetracycline alone had the largest amount  of EPS, almost double that of the community exposed to Ibuprofen alone. The community   

45 

   

exposed to both contaminants contained an n intermedia te level of EPS, in the m middle of the two  extremes s.

4.3.3. Areas of Chromatograms 

Chromatograms were also examined based on total area under the curve to establish a  quantitative approach to analyzing the EPS concentration, as opposed to visual comparison.  The areas under the curves of the chromatograms were measured using a method involving  image editing software. The software used is an open source free program available for  download (https://www.gimp.org/); the method follows the same principles as an older  method in which the graph is physically cut out of paper and weighed on a scale  (http://quiz2.chem.arizona.edu/vip/chromatography/GC/analysis.htm). The main difference is  that the computer method allows a more precise measurement (significant to 6 digits), and the  method is not susceptible to user error caused by inconsistent cuts with scissors. The results  produce a value for the area under the curves that can be compared between the different  scenarios.  The bar graphs in Figure 11 show the total area under the curves and the area under  each of the 2 peaks seen in the chromatograms. The results of these measurements showed  that even though the peak height of the first peak was significant higher than the height of the  second peak, the areas of the second peaks were in most cases significantly higher than the  first; Except for samples where tetracycline was present.

Figure 12 Graph showing average areas of chromatograms of WWTC EPS exposed to varying concentrations of Ibuprofen and  Tetracycline error bars represent the Standard deviation 

 

Careful notice should be taken however to not confuse peak area with concentration of 

the proteins or carbohydrates present in that peak. While the first peaks in all graphs can be  compared with each other when discussing concentration, the first peak and second peak of  the same graph cannot be compared in the same way. The reason for this is because the peaks  represent molecules of different sizes and there is not a linear relationship with absorbance  between different sized species.   Further analysis can be done to determine total proteins and carbohydrates of the  individual peaks by collecting the elution volumes after chromatography in separate containers.  Unfortunately the column selected for this experiment does not suit that application as it has a  much narrower column diameter than those used in previous studies (Avella et al., 2010;  Pasquini et al., 2013). The tradeoff however is that the narrower column used in this 
48   

   

experiment provides greater resolution between the different peaks. This was confirmed as  chromatograms obtained with our 4.5mm diameter column showed far greater peak separation  than the chromatograms obtained with the same column type at 9mm diameter as seen in      research by Avellas and Pasquini (Avella et al., 2010; Pasquini et al., 2013).

4.4. Possible model explaining effect of Ibuprofen and tetracycline on WWTC 

One of the main characteristics of EPS in wastewater communities is the protection of  floc organisms against antibiotics by means of lowered diffusion coefficients (Pasquini et al.,  2013; Sheng et al., 2010). This means that EPS serves as an actual physical barrier against  antibiotics or other contaminants. 

49   

   

As A  a result, th he natural re esponse of th he commun ity in the pre esence of te etracycline in n  order to prevent a significant dro op in growth h may be to increase the e amount of EPS which  allows th he bacteria to handle tha at threat.

A visual expla anation can be viewed in n Figure 12, w where the bl lue circle rep presents the e  penetration of tetrac cycline into the t  thick lay yer of EPS.  When W  Ibupro ofen is present alone the ere wasn't a reduction in n growth rate as Ibuprof fen  has no mode m  of actio on for killing bacteria however there e was a redu uction in the amount of E EPS  (Figure 12 2B) suggestin ng that in so ome way it ca an affect the e functioning g of the com mmunity.  As s  mentione ed previousl ly (Yin et al., , 2014), NSA AIDs have bee en found to be effective e against bac cteria  in some cases c  althou ugh the study y did not exa amine Ibupr rofen specifically.  Furthermore the  NSAIDs used u  were te ested at µg/m mL concentr rations (103 t times higher r than conce entrations us sed  in this ex xperiment) and a  therefore the results s may not be e relevant.    

50   

   

Finally once the WWTC is exposed to both Ibuprofen and Tetracycline there is a drop in  the growth rate as seen in Figure 6, even though the levels of EPS are comparable to what is  found in the control as seen in Figure 9 that is the EPS per OD unit is greater in the sample  containing both contaminants. A visual representation may be seen in Figure 12. As can be seen,  the EPS levels are comparable to control, and as a result the same concentration of Tetracycline  is now capable of penetrating the EPS layer and reaching the cells. This explanation is  supported by the reduction in growth rate seen (Figure 6). Although sludge aggregates are  usually surrounded by and filled with EPS; the less EPS there is, the more likely that antibiotics  can penetrate to the cells regardless of how low the diffusion coefficient is. 
4.4.1. Protein and Carbohydrate Concentrations of EPS 

The concentrations of protein in each sample were measured in order to determine if  changes seen with the EPS response could be linked to protein concentration. The results  obtained are shown in Figure 13.  Although, in general it appeared more protein was present in  the community exposed to Ibuprofen only, and it appeared less than the control when  Tetracycline was present, no significant difference between the groups could be found.   Overall  the variance within the sample groups was quite large and as a result it could not be concluded  that the changes seen in the EPS were a result of a change in protein concentrations.

52 

There was also no significant difference between the groups in regards to carbohydrate  concentration (Figure 15). It is important to remember that while EPS is comprised of up to 90%  proteins and carbohydrates, a recent literature review has shown that up to 20% of the EPS  may be humic acids (Sheng et al., 2010). As such, further research should be carried out to  determine if other EPS constituents are affected by Tetracycline and Ibuprofen.   In terms of protein to carbohydrate ratio it was found that the samples had far greater  concentrations of protein (average 6:1), this is expected at ratios found in literature usually fall  between values of 1.5 to 3 (Sheng et al., 2010). Ratios reported here are higher than literature  values most likely due to the high variance of results obtained, while done in triplicate the  values obtained varied highly.  4.5. Soluble Microbial Products Analysis  The SMP produced by the communities was also screened for the protein and carbohydrate  content after exposure of the community to the compounds, as mentioned before the SMP  consists of extracellular products that are much smaller, and therefore soluble in solution  without the need for a CER. Unlike the EPS samples that were resuspended in PBS buffer, SMP  samples still remained in the LB buffer once centrifuged. As a result the contents of the LB  media caused extremely high absorbance readings so that any differences due to exposure to  the compounds were masked.  Furthermore the presence of the LB also prevented meaningful  results from being obtained in quantitative tests such as Anthrone Method and Bradford.   Furthermore, there are few values in the literature for SMP which suggests other researchers  have experience the same phenomenon.  Future work should investigate whether there is a 
53 

   

more accurate way to measure protein and carbohydrate concentrations in the SMP to  determine whether the EPS reduction seen with Ibuprofen are due to less production of EPS or  degradation of the existing EPS into the soluble phase.  5. Conclusions and Future Work  EPS production is a defining characteristic of many bacteria, especially of those found in  wastewater treatment plants. It is responsible for providing structure, nutrition, antibiotic  resistance, and adsorption of contaminants such as heavy metals and BTEXs. This in addition to  the fact that EPS is produced more in times of stress indicate that it should be treated as an  important metric when determining the health and susceptibilities of a wastewater community.  If the WWTC is not capable of maintaining EPS it is creating vulnerabilities to future  contaminants, as well as reducing its ability to survive in times of hardship.  The main research questions posed by this study were to determine whether or not two  extremely common pharmaceuticals could illicit effects on the growth rates of P. putida  BBC443, and WWTCs. And secondly to determine the effects these compounds might have on  the production of EPS at varying concentrations when one or both these compounds were  present.  The results obtained in regards to P .putida showed that tetracycline did have an inhibitory  effect on growth; however the strain of P. putida tested does not have a resistance to  tetracycline which can explain the inhibition of growth rate. This decrease in growth was not  affected by the addition of Ibuprofen. In fact the addition of Ibuprofen did not appear to have  any effect on the growth rate of P. putida regardless of concentration tested. 
54   

   

When looking at the growth rates of WWTCs it was determined that unlike in the case of P.  putida, Tetracycline had no significant effect on the growth rate. This could be reasoned due to  the fact that WWTCs are extremely diverse microbial communities, and as a result of being  exposed to antibiotics on a consistent basis they are extremely prone to developing antibiotic  resistance that can be transferred from one species of bacteria to another via plasmid transfer.  However once Ibuprofen was added to the mix there was an inhibitory effect on growth rate  which was statistically significant. These results could not be explained solely on the data  obtained from a growth curve, and as a result the EPS production of the WWTC was examined  via the use of HPLC.   Once HPLC was performed on the EPS constituents, it was found that both concentrations  of Ibuprofen examined elicited a significant decrease in EPS production. This result was  consistent with what was previously seen in the literature, however the lowest concentration  looked at previously was 100 ng/mL or roughly twice the highest environmentally relevant  concentration. I showed that the inhibitory effect on EPS by Ibuprofen continued at much lower  and environmentally relevant concentrations of 16 ng/mL, indicating that even current  concentrations of this contaminant could be having effects in nature.  The effect of Tetracycline on EPS was also examined by HPLC and the results obtained were  similar to what was seen in previous literature. One study which looked at several antibiotics,  but not tetracycline, showed that there was an increase in EPS production in the presence of  antibiotics (Pasquini et al., 2013). This increase in EPS was again explained as a result of stress  on the WWTC, the production of a physical barrier for protection. A second study (Avella et al., 

55   

2010) which looked at Tetracycline examined a concentration of 10 mg/mL, 200 fold higher  than used in this study of 0.05 mg/mL. Again showing that even at environmentally relevant  concentrations WWTCs are being affected by the contaminant concentrations currently found  through monitoring.  By far the most interesting result however was that when Ibuprofen and Tetracycline were  present together, the levels of EPS were not different than the control. Furthermore, each  compound on their own did not show a negative impact the growth rate of WWTCs, yet in  combination there was a reduction the growth rate of the community. Since contaminants are  regulated on a case by case basis, and neither compound caused growth inhibition these results  could have not been predicted.   Current opinion is that EPS is produced as a defense against antibiotics; therefore in  conditions where the WWTC are only exposed to a single antibiotic they will produce enough  EPS to stave off the antibiotic. However, in combination with Ibuprofen, an NSAID, these effects  may be masked since Ibuprofen is shown to decrease EPS production. Overall, combinations  need to be studied since outcomes cannot be predicted based on the data generated for single  compounds.   In this study the individual chromatogram peaks could not be analyzed for protein or  carbohydrate content as the column used traded the benefit of elution collection for peak  resolution. Examining the individual peaks should be of interest for future research as it can be  used to determine the actual molecular structure of the eluted compounds.  

56 

I believe that the main applications of this study should be in regards to the decision making  of policy and regulation for current and new drugs. When recalling how contaminants are  examined before regulation occurs in all three regions (EU, US, CA), it was said that most drugs  are regulated on an individual basis which means that drug interactions are not taken into  consideration. However these results clearly show that drugs of completely different groups  can have additive effects on complex WWTCs found in urban settings. It brings concern to a  major question: "how could it be responsible to determine the safety of one drug, much less  one group of drugs in isolation when two extremely popular drugs from completely different  pharmaceutical groups can elicit additive negative effects?"    Again it is important to emphasize that the results obtained in this study were found when  testing pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations. With global population  and water stress to peak by 2050 the situation can only get worse if steps are not taken to  address these issues today.
