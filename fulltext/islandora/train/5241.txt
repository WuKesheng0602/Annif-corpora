What Do We Need to Measure, and  How Do We Measure It?

Beyond Broadband Access:  

Two Star;ng Points 
1. "Broadband is a key enabler of the  informa;on society, increasing produc;vity  and compe;;veness across all sectors of the  economy." Broadband in Europe: How Brussels Can Wire the Informa:on Society.  2. Canadian Internet Use Survey data (~69% of pop.): 

... and a Nagging Ques;on 
· How can we beSer understand the  "broadband as an enabler of the informa;on  society" discourse?  Assump:ons driving this research: 
· it is important to understand how broadband  connec;vity can benefit individuals, improving  quality of life, social and economic outcomes etc.  · If we understand this, we can get more value from  investments in broadband, and enable/encourage  more people to engage in the informa;on society 

Rhetoric (or received wisdom?) 
· "Providing ci:zens with access to broadband  connec:vity will allow them to engage in the  informa:on society"  · 3 problema?c aspects to the statement: 
i) access to broadband does not ensure that broadband is used, or  that it is useful for the user (access  use)  ii) all broadband networks are not the same, meaning that the  poten;al benefits of broadband access may not be equal for  all broadband users )broadband  broadband)  iii) there is uncertainty as to exactly how to recognize the  broadbandenabled benefits of engagement in the informa;on  society (the informa;on society is hard to grasp) 

All Broadband Connec;ons are Not  the Same: The Defini;on of  Broadband MaSers  

The poten;al   benefits of expanded   broadband services are  enormous. The jobs of the  future will increasingly depend  on people having consistent  and reliable access to  broadband services such as  distance educa;on, telehealth  coverage and new online  business opportuni;es." 

High speed broadband is  increasingly essen;al to the way  Australians communicate, and do  business. It will help drive  Australia's produc;vity, improve  educa;on and health service  delivery and connect our big ci;es  and regional centres. 

But...  all broadband  announcements are not  created equal

The holy grail? 

Available Data? 
· Interna;onal indicators (e.g. ITU's ICT  Development Index, World Economic Forum/ INSEAD's Networked Readiness Index)  measure readiness, not use 
­ Connec;vity Scorecard is moving in the right  direc;on 

· Other sources are i) na;onal sta;s;cal  agencies; ii) NGOs and academics (e.g. Pew  Internet Project, WIP); iii) private sector 

Making Do With What We've Got 
· "the public bureaucracies that collect data and generate  sta;s;cs, which are widely used, are inherently conserva;ve  and slow to employ new methodologies that might provoke  cri;cism" (2007 PIP on Measuring Broadband) 

Example  Sta;s;cs Canada CIUS  Derived  usage measures:  · Intensity:  45% HI; 55% LI  · Scope: Email, browsing > 50% of pop.  · Speed * intensity: 42% HSp/HI; 46% HSp/LI  · Engagement: 33% HSc/HI; 36% LSc, LI 

Using Broadband to Par;cipate in  the Informa;on Society  

How do we know an informa;on  society when we see one? 
· "a society in which lowcost informa;on and  ICT are in general use"   · "a future Informa;on Society is one in which  Informa;on and Communica;on Technologies  (ICTs) are available anywhere, any;me and to  anyone"  

Egov, ehealth,  elearning,  ecommerce vs.(?)  YouTube, biSorrent  and HDTV? 

Informa?on  Society? 

· Macroeconomic studies on the benefits of  broadband don't provide insights into how  individuals can become more engaged with  the informa;on society  · Available data tend to be of the yes/no variety  (did you do the following ac;vi;es online...),  and insufficient to ar;culate the link between  broadband/internet use and beneficial  outcomes  · Lots of red herrings (e.g. HDTV) 

What we need to know:

· Intensive research methodologies,  observa;onal approaches, usercentric models  of data collec;on

Conclusion 
· Just scratching the surface on what we should  understand about broadband use and  informa;on society outcomes (impacts)  · Improving data collec;on requires ;me,  money, exper;se but will be very beneficial in  terms of reducing digital divide, increasing  ci;zen engagement etc.  · Team efforts/collabora;on will be central  · Don't forget about mobile devices
