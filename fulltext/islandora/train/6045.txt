AERODYNAMIC STUDY OF TILTING ASYMMETRICAL DUCTED FANS MOUNTED AT THE WING TIPS OF A VTOL UAV

Bahram Raeisi Doctor of Philosophy, Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University, 2016

ABSTRACT

Tilting ducted fans attached to the wing tips of vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial vehicles (VTOL UAVs) define new applications for these types of vehicles. This new configuration gives VTOL UAVs the ability to hover like helicopters and fly forward like airplanes. These abilities provide VTOL UAVs with possibility of using any arbitrary location for take-off and landing combined with enhanced range and speed. The thrust vectoring is another advantage of this new configuration, which can be used in most of the necessary maneuvers. The flow behaviour around tilting ducted fans needs to be studied as it has significant effects on the performance of the VTOL UAVs. The first objective of this research is to investigate the use of asymmetrical shape for the external body of ducted fans. This geometry can generate additional lift in cruise mode, which can lead to more applications for the VTOL UAVs by saving more energy. Both CFD and experimental methods showed noticeable improvement in the lift coefficient by using an asymmetrical ducted fan. The second objective is to predict the induced velocity (


) of the inlet flow to the rotor plane. This is required for computing aerodynamic

coefficients necessary for stability and control analysis of the proposed VTOL UAV. "Actuator Disk Model" combined with the assumption of "Constant Delivered Power" to the propeller were used successfully to calculate


for the CFD simulations. The third objective is using CFD

iii

simulation for predicting aerodynamic forces and pitching moments of the tilting ducted fans in the transition conditions for different tilting rates. The effects of the stall and flow separation on the aerodynamic coefficients were discussed and compared for both ducted fans. The fourth objective is using the aerodynamic coefficients of the tilting ducted fans to predict and compare the level flight conditions of the proposed VTOL UAV during transition between cruise mode and hover. Results of this research demonstrate satisfactory agreement between CFD simulations and wind tunnel tests for all of these objectives, which could predict the aerodynamic behaviour of the proposed VTOL UAV during transition between cruise mode and hover.

1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

1.1

Introduction

Today, the fast growing applications of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different fields bring the need for the improvement of the UAVs' performance. Their potential for the low cost flights and simplicity of operation are strong reasons to dedicate more resources in this field. Although progress in propulsion systems, electronics, and composite materials plays a significant role in making UAVs smaller and more powerful, there are other areas to explore for improving the performance of UAVs. A typical UAV mission profile consists of reaching to a specific area in a short time, hovering while gathering information, and leaving that area as fast as possible. The typical mission profile becomes complicated when there is no specific airport for take-off and landing of that UAV and it has to fly a long distance for the mission. This complicated mission profile requires UAVs to be capable of performing take-off and landing in any arbitrary location, flying like an airplane and hovering like a helicopter. The vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAVs can provide hovering same as small helicopters by using open rotors or propellers. However, this approach has several drawbacks. For example, open rotors/propellers cause tremendous amount of noise while rotor blades are subject to large tip-losses. Also, the low-height rotor installation can be dangerous for the ground crew. Such drawbacks in addition to the poor efficiency in forward flight make this configuration undesirable. Figure 1-1 shows the size of one recent helicopter base UAV.

1

Figure 1-1: Yamaha R-Max helicopter (Public domain [1]) The ideal technical solution for this problem is using ducted fan instead of open rotors/propellers. Ducted fans provide a higher static thrust-to-power ratio for a given diameter than open propellers, due to the diffusion of the rotor jet stream behind the duct [2]. They are quieter and safer than open propellers as duct absorbs noise and keeps the rotating fan away from the ground crew. One of the most common problems for both ducted fans and open propellers is flow separation during horizontal forward flight, which happens when some parts of relative inlet flow have steep rotation to enter the rotor plane. The flow separation is more extensive for open propeller as the inlet flow has a direct impact on the blade tips and outlet jet on the windward side. As simulated and compared in Figure 1-2, large parts of open rotor in the windward side experienced flow separation and this creates positive pitching moments. Ducted fans can provide maximum convergence for the flow streamlines into the rotor plane because of inlet lip roundness. The tip-loss is less for ducted fans due to small gap between the blade tips and duct inner surface. There are several types of ducted fan UAVs and they are being used for different purposes. Figure 1-3 shows some of recent ducted fan UAVs.

(a) (b) (c) Figure 1-3: The most recent ducted fan UAVs: (a) Honeywell T-Hawk (Public domain [3]), (b) BAE Systems IAV2 (Public domain [4]), (c) Aurora Golden Eye-50 (Public domain [5]) Having the thrust line of ducted fan parallel to the flight path creates a uniform flow to the rotor disk and results in faster forward velocity for ducted fan UAV. Many UAVs are using only one ducted fan. Those single ducted fan UAVs without flying surfaces (as shown in Figure 1-3a and Figure 1-3b) have low speed forward flight in the range of 10 to 20 m/s. They are less efficient in horizontal flight due to the high angle of attack (AoA) between flight direction and thrust line, as generated ram drag creates a large nose-up pitching moment. The high AoA between flight direction and thrust line can cause a sequence of events such as: flow separation around the leading 3

edge of the duct lip, distortion of the distribution of the velocity magnitude at the inlet, reduction of the breathing area at the fan rotor, and thrust reduction. Based on the research done by several researchers (e.g. [8]-[17]), there are few solutions to solve aforementioned weaknesses, but each solution has its specific disadvantages. The first method is improving the shape of duct lip to delay flow separation in both forward flight and hover. However, it is hard to find an optimum lip shape for both conditions. The second is adding some equipment to provide a uniform flow to the rotor plane, which results in increasing the weight and drag of the ducted fan. The third solution is increasing delivered power to the fan/propeller to reduce the effect of the leading side separation bubble, which results in consuming more energy for reattachment of the flow to the leading edge of the duct lip. The ideal solution is minimizing the AoA between the thrust line and flight path, which can provide uniform flow to the rotor disk, higher thrust, faster forward velocity, less drag, and longer range and endurance in horizontal flight. However, this would need wings and control surfaces to be added to the body of the UAV. As shown in Figure 1-3c, adding flight surfaces can increase the UAVs speed in horizontal flight up to / . This will increase the unwanted gyroscopic moment of rotating fan during

conversion from cruise mode to hover, and will affect the stability of UAV, especially for those

UAVs similar to Aurora Golden Eye-50 with a larger range of tilting angle. The other disadvantage of this configuration is the necessity of tilting the whole fuselage of the UAV in hover for surveillance and capturing images.

1.2

Motivation

The rotating fan has two major negative effects of "unwanted fuselage rotation and gyroscopic moment" during UAVs flights. All single ducted fan UAVs have a set of equipment such as "exit

4

vane flaps" for redirecting the jet stream behind the duct to prevent fuselage rotation in hover due to the rotating fan. The rotating fan also creates unwanted gyroscopic moment during rapid maneuvers and conversion between hover and cruise mode. This moment has negative effects on the stability of single ducted fan UAVs and needs to be cancelled. Assume  as the rotor's moment of inertia about its spin axis,  as rotor rotational speed (rad/s)

generated gyroscopic moment of   about z-axis will be applied to the UAV fuselage during tilting about y-axis. This additional unwanted gyroscopic moment acts as a yaw moment on the fuselage of the UAV and has negative effects on the directional stability of the UAV during tilting.

and  as tilting speed (rad/s) of ducted fan about y-axis, as shown in Figure 1-4. Then, the

Figure 1-4: The generated gyroscopic moment of   (about z-axis) on tilting ducted fan One logical solution to the aforementioned issues is using the combination of fuselage and wing with two counter-rotating tilting ducted fans installed at the wing tips (Figure 1-5), which gives such UAVs the ability to take-off and land like a helicopter, as well as cruise like an airplane. This will increase the velocity, range and endurance of the flight, cancel the ram drag and its related pitching moment in cruise flight, prevent the fuselage rotation and cancel the gyroscopic moments

during rapid maneuvers due to the rotating fans. One important advantage of the proposed VTOL UAV is minimizing the angle between flight path and thrust line. Moreover, tilting ducted fans installed on the wing tips of VTOL UAV provide thrust vectoring ability, which can be used for necessary maneuvers such as yaw in hover and roll and steady banked turn in cruise mode [6]. This configuration provides ideal image capturing for cameras attached to the fuselage in both cruise mode and hover.

2. BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 Background The research for development of vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft started in 1950s. These aircraft can take-off and land vertically or from short runways. One important parameter for the V/STOL aircraft is ability for hover during their missions. A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) airplane is a subset of the V/STOL aircraft, which does not need runways for take-off or landing. Hundreds of V/STOL aircraft were designed in the last 60 years but most of them were experiments or failed in the first flights and never became operational. Only few V/STOL aircraft went for mass production such as Harrier, Yak-38 Forger, V-22 Osprey and Lockheed Martin F-35B. Table 2.1 shows the important V/STOL aircraft with brief explanation about each one [7]. The idea of using tilting ducted fans attached to the wing tips is not new, but it seems still needs more improvement as there is no operational VTOL aircraft with tilting ducted fans attached to the wing tips yet. As mentioned before, ducted fans provide a higher static thrust-to-power ratio for a given diameter than open propellers due to the diffusion of the rotor jet stream behind the duct [2]. So, it is beneficial to use tilting ducted fans attached to the wing tips for a VTOL aircraft as it can provide thrust vectoring to control aircraft as well. This idea is more useful for designing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as it will be available for all surveillance missions very quickly. The proposed VTOL UAV with two tilting ducted fans installed on the wing tips shown in Figure 1-5 has the ability to fly same as an airplane and also hover, take-off and land same as a helicopter from any arbitrary location. This research will discuss the aerodynamic behaviour of tilting ducted fans which can be used for this purpose. Table 2.1: List of V/STOL aircraft from 1950s [7] 8

2.2 Literature review The study of aerodynamic behaviour of tilting ducted fans in transition between hover and cruise mode is essential to understand and predict the performance of VTOL UAVs with tilting ducted fans installed on their wing tips. Most of the research were done in the fields of: modeling, control, flight test, tip clearance, duct lip shaping, various control devices, aerodynamic, and performance of ducted fans in hover and 10

crosswind conditions in the last six decades. The following are important research outcomes published in the fields of aerodynamic and performance of ducted fans, which could be useful for explaining and verifying the results in this research. Extensive research has been done on the flow field properties around ducted fans in different conditions. Martin and Tung [8] measured aerodynamic loads on a ducted fan UAV with a 10-inch diameter fan rotor in different AoA in hover and different crosswind velocities. They found that at low RPM, the viscous losses of the duct internal flow counteracted the duct thrust, which is an important result for designing micro UAVs. They also showed that by increasing the rotor tip gap, the duct thrust decreased dramatically. The other important result was that by decreasing duct leading edge radius, the ratio of duct thrust to isolated propeller thrust was decreased, but the stability for hovering in a crosswind was improved. Wind tunnel tests and numerical investigations on the performance of a 12-inch ducted fan in crosswind were reported by Fleming et al. [9]. They studied several important design considerations such as stabilizing or righting torque on the duct lip due to the presence of a crosswind, and the positioning of the control vanes in consideration of duct jet bending and maintaining a natural tilting effect in gusts. The leading edge geometry of ducts, which is an important parameter in offsetting the effects of adverse aerodynamic characteristics, was examined in experiments by Graf et al. [10] to improve ducted fan performance in forward flight. They found that the performance of a lip shape with a small leading edge radius was the best in forward flight and crosswind conditions, which was due to the reduction in pitching moment. Whereas, a lip shape with a large leading edge radius performed best in static condition that resulted in thrust improvement.

11

The flow separation around the leading edge of the duct lip is an important phenomenon. The separation occurs when the relative inlet flow has a sharp turn in entering to its inlet plane during horizontal flight. Akturk et al. [11] used a planar particle image velocimeter (PIV) system to investigate the near duct aerodynamic performance in hover and forward flight. Their experiments showed that the flow separation from the leading side at the inlet duct lip distorted the distribution of the velocity magnitude at the inlet and resulted in the reduction of the breathing area at the fan rotor. The inlet flow distortion caused a drop in thrust force generated by the ducted fan system. Finally, the inlet flow distortion generated excessive moment imbalance and non-uniformities in the exit jet of their ducted fan model in the forward flight condition. They reported that an increase in the rotational speed of the fan (from 9000 rpm to 15000 rpm in their experiments) could reduce the effect of the leading side separation bubble. Camci and Akturk proposed the "Double Ducted Fan", by adding a secondary stationary duct system to control "inlet lip separation" related momentum insufficiency at the inlet of the fan rotor occurring at elevated forward flight velocities [12]. Although they reported an improvement in the thrust due to reduction in the flow separation at the leading edge of the duct lip, there is a wide area with the separated flow at the leeward side of the secondary stationary duct, which increases the total drag and pitching moment of the double ducted fan. Tilting ducted fans mounted on the wing tips were used in Doak VZ-4-DA and Bell Aerosystems Company X-22A airplanes. Both projects were cancelled by the US Army in 1963 and 1967 due to weaknesses in their performance. The aerodynamic characteristics of the sevenfoot-diameter ducted propeller used on the Bell X-22A for variations of power, free-stream velocity, blade angle, and duct AoA were investigated and reported by Mort and Games [13]. They found the stall conditions as a function of duct AoA for both the upstream and downstream duct

12

lips. An important result was that the complete flow separation happens with high AoA and low power. Yaggy and Mort [14, 15] also tested the performance of a four-foot-diameter ducted fan used on Doak VZ-4-DA in hover and forward flight conditions. They found that the flow separation at the windward side of the duct lip was the reason for the rapid changes in the pitching moment and increment in the required power. One important result from their report was that the ducted fans installed on the wing tips needed less power compared to the free flying ducted fans. Moving ducted fans in freestream can create well-known aerodynamic forces and moments such as lift, drag and pitching moment. Ram drag is another important force which is generated due to turning of the oncoming flow from the freestream direction to the axial direction of the ducted fan. As the centre of pressure for redirected flow is above the duct lip, this force can generate a large nose-up pitching moment about the centre of gravity of ducted fans. Ram drag can be larger than profile drag of the ducted fan's fuselage as it is proportional to the mass flow rate to the rotor plane and crosswind velocity. The open rotors or the shrouded rotor configurations with short duct chord lengths (or a large duct aspect ratio, AR=d/c) generate less ram drag related to ducted fans [9]. The ducts' inlet lip radius and configuration was studied theoretically and experimentally by Weir [16]. Measuring the aerodynamic forces and moments for different inlet lip configurations showed that by increasing the inlet lip radius the lift force of ducted fan was increasing slightly. Also, adding a diffuser to the system could increase the lift. However, the pitching moment was increased due to these two improvements. The application of thrust vectoring for directional control of the single ducted fan UAV was studied by many researchers. The wind tunnel tests performed by Abrego and Bulaga showed the

13

importance of exit vane flap deflection and flap chord length effects on providing side force [17]. Also, they showed that duct thrust coefficient was not affected by extending the duct chord length. The proposed VTOL UAV in this research can have best performance as tilting ducted fans installed at its wing tips can provide an appropriate angle between flight path and thrust line during cruise, maneuvering, and transition between cruise and hover. Tilting ducted fans can minimize flow separation around duct lips, which results in producing more thrust and saving more energy. The proposed VTOL UAV does not need any complicated control system such as control vane [9] or exit vane flaps [17] as a complete set of control systems (rudder and elevator in the tail) are being used for directional control. Thrust vectoring can have wide usage in the proposed model for directional control and maneuvering. It can be used for yaw in hover and roll and steady banked turn in cruise mode.

2.3 Problem statement The performance of a ducted fan can be affected by various parameters. One important parameter is the shape of the duct's outer body, which has significant effects on the external flow field properties in cruise mode. All studied models in the previous research (e.g. [8]-[17]) were symmetrical ducted fans, and to the best of my knowledge, there was no specific published study for using an asymmetrical shape for external body of the ducted fans. Then, it is necessary to compare advantages and disadvantages of symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans. The first objective of this research is to investigate the possibility of using an asymmetrical shape for the external body of the ducted fans to generate additional lift for the proposed VTOL UAV. This will help to design a smaller wing and reducing wing related drag to save more energy and increase the range and endurance of the flight. The second objective is to combine the actuator

14

disk model [18] with the assumption of constant power used by the propeller to introduce an alternative method for predicting the velocity of the inlet flow to the rotor plane. This is necessary for computing thrust, ram drag, and aerodynamic forces and pitching moments during CFD simulations. The third objective is using CFD simulation for predicting aerodynamic forces and pitching moment on the tilting ducted fans in the transition conditions for different tilting rates. The fourth objective is using the aerodynamic coefficients of the tilting ducted fans to predict and compare the level flight conditions of the proposed VTOL UAV during transition between cruise mode and hover. This research presents the wind tunnel experimental outcomes in addition to the CFD simulations numerical results, employed for predicting aerodynamic forces and pitching moments acting on the symmetric and asymmetrical ducted fans. The proposed asymmetrical model can be used as the external body of a ducted fan to provide additional lift in the cruise mode.

3. APPROACH TO CFD MODELING

3.1 "Momentum Theory" and "Actuator Disk Model" Momentum theory applies to propulsive systems where the flowing gas is mainly atmospheric air [19]. The propulsive system increases the energy of the outgoing air. The increment in the energy of the outgoing air is used to increase the rearwards momentum of the air to produce thrust of the propeller or engine. This theory is based on the concept of the ideal actuator disk. This is an infinitely thin disk of area A which gives pressure energy to air passing through the disk without any resistance. The assumptions for an ideal actuator disk are as follows:      The energy is being added uniformly over the whole area of the disk The velocity of the air through the disk is constant through the whole area All energy supplied to the disk is transferred to the air The flow through the rotor is one-dimensional The flow is quasi-steady, incompressible, and inviscid

Consider the system shown in Figure 3-1. The actuator disk is at rest in a fluid which far away ahead of the disk is quiescent (i.e.,  ) and has a pressure of po. The outer curved lines show

the streamlines separating the fluid which passes through the disk from that which does not.

The velocity of fluid is increased to Vi just before entering the actuator disk and its pressure drops to p1. The fluid pressure is increased to p2 after exiting from the actuator disc, but due to assuming constant density of the flow before and after the disk, the flow velocity does not have a sudden change. The air expands and accelerates after exiting the disk until its pressure returns to po and its speed is w. The flow behind the disk which is bounded between streamlines is known as the slipstream.

The velocity of upstream fluid (far from the disk) is zero, then thrust can be found as:



Using the principle of conservation of energy, the work done on the disk should be equal to the

gain in energy of the fluid per unit time. Thus, the work done per unit time, or the consumed power by the actuator disk, is

Ducted fans are designed to have specific ratio between the area of slipstream flow at the outlet and fan's area. This could be shown as  = as wake contraction parameter. 18  by

required by the open rotor to generate the same thrust.

3.2 Duct models To study the effects of external shape on the aerodynamic coefficients, two ducted fans with different geometry for external bodies (one symmetrical and one asymmetrical) were simulated in this research. The external body of the symmetrical model is created by revolving the upper side profile of NACA 0012 airfoil, as shown in Figure 3-3.

The external body of the asymmetrical ducted fan consists of different profiles of high lift FX 63-137 airfoil, as shown in Figure 3-4. This airfoil is intended for human-powered aircraft in the wide range of Reynolds No. ( ×   × ) [20]. The profile of the upper side of the

The internal bodies for both symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans are similar, as shown in Figure 3-3b and Figure 3-4d. To reduce the number of parameters which have effects on this research, the mean diameters at the duct inlet/outlet are set equal to the duct chord length ( = ) for both symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans, as shown in Figure 3-3b and Figure 3-4d.

ANSYS-Fluent is a CFD software package used to simulate fluid flow problems. It uses the finite-volume method to solve the governing equations [21]. The grid generation is done using GAMBIT software. The selected models can tilt about the z-axis and as a result the xy plane is the plane of symmetry for simulations. As shown in Figure 3-5a, the selected domain for solving Navier-Stokes equations is a sphere. The ducted fan is in the centre of spherical domain with a radius of 10 characteristic duct chord lengths.

The 3D discretized Navier-Stokes equations are used for incompressible flow by ANSYSFluent. The interior border around the ducted fan consists of a sphere of radius 1 characteristic duct chord length, as shown in Figure 3-5b. The volumetric cells are tetrahedrons with triangular faces for the spherical boundaries and all faces in the domain are divided into triangular cells, as shown in Figure 3-6. The grids are very fine around the duct and become coarse as they go farther from the ducted fan, as shown in Figure 3-6.

3.4 Defining aerodynamic forces and pitching moment acting on the models The aerodynamic forces and pitching moments acting on the models can be described as follows: 1- For the ducts without fans, as shown in Figure 3-7, the components of the aerodynamic forces in the x, y, and z-directions can be described in the form of drag and lift forces by using the following equations:

of symmetry for the models. The z component of the moment (pitching moment) is given by: = =


If the tilting axis of the duct does not pass through the aerodynamic centre or centre of gravity of the duct, then the lift, drag and weight of the duct create additional pitching moments as well. Then the total pitching moment about the tilting axis (oz) in general form is:  = + cos  + sin   +   =

2- When a fan is considered, the fan thrust force has components in both x and y directions. Also, due to the pressure difference between the two sides of the fan, the pressure distribution around the ducted fan is not the same as the pressure distribution around the duct without a fan. By tilting the ducted fan, the pressure distribution is changing around the duct and causes the changes in the aerodynamic forces and pitching moment as well. Due to the presence of the rotor, a portion of the freestream flow has to change its direction to pass through the duct. Changes in the momentum of the freestream flow create ram drag. Based on the mass flow rate through the duct, freestream velocity and AoA, the ram drag can be expressed as [22]: =  sin = 


This shows ram drag is zero if the ducted fan is parallel to the incoming flow (then AoA=0) or if the ducted fan is in hover with no crosswind (then U=0). Ram drag is perpendicular to the thrust line and normally generates a nose-up duct pitching moment based on the distance between the tilting axis of the duct and the centre of pressure of the shrouded rotor (which is about 0.75R further above the corresponding location for the open rotor [23]). This additional pitching moment can be expressed as: = × (3.26)

Due to the changes in AoA and flow separation around the duct lip in higher AoAs, the velocity of incoming flow to the duct intake is not constant and this causes the changes in the thrust force and pressure distribution around the duct. The change in the pressure distribution around the ducted fan is significant, and the calculated aerodynamic forces and pitching moment of the ducted fan are not comparable with those for the duct without a fan. The ANSYS-Fluent software calculates the ducts' lift, drag and pitching moment and their coefficients by solving pressure distribution for any selected surface of the models. The tilting axis, which passes through the centre of the duct, is the reference axis for calculating all pitching moments. Thrust, ram drag and its related pitching moment are calculated using related equations and added to the resultant aerodynamic forces and pitching moment of the models.

3.5 Turbulence modeling for ducted fans in crosswind Turbulence modeling is an important issue in CFD modeling of ducted fans in crosswind. The possible flow separation at the windward duct lip in high angled crosswind, combined with a wide range of tilting angle for ducted fans, provides non-uniform aerodynamic forces and pitching moment and a highly turbulent condition around the ducted fans [8, 10]. The standard - 

turbulence modeling was used in this study for CFD simulations over ducts without a fan/rotor, and the RNG (Re-Normalisation Group) -  turbulence modeling was used for simulations over

ducted fans due to weak to moderate swirling flow (with Swirling No. < 0.5). The standard

equations describe the turbulence kinetic energy ( ) and its dissipation rate ( ) in this model. The most important assumptions for derivation of the standard -  turbulence modeling is that the

-  turbulence modeling is a semi-empirical model [24]. Two model transport

26

flow is fully turbulent, and the effects of molecular viscosity are negligible. Then, the standard -  turbulence modeling is valid for fully turbulent flows. The RNG

modeling [25]. It has additional term in its dissipation rate ( ) equation which improves the

-  turbulence modeling has the similar form of the standard

-  turbulence

accuracy for rapidly strained flows. As the RNG theory provides an analytically derived differential formula for effective viscosity, then this model is suitable for low Reynolds number effects. Also the effect of swirl on turbulence is included in this model, which improves the accuracy for swirling flow as can be seen at the exit of ducted fans in this research. More details for selecting turbulence modeling are presented in the Appendix A. The standard -  turbulence modeling has been successfully used by other researchers such

as Akturk et al. [11] to study a 5-inch ducted fan for vertical or short take-off and landing UAV applications and also by Camci and Akturk [12] to study a double ducted fan.

3.6 Mesh selection for CFD modeling To find the best number of cells, three different mesh sizes were considered for symmetrical duct without fan as described in Table 3.1. The ANSYS-Fluent calculated lift, drag and pitching moment coefficients for these three mesh sizes in static conditions at different AoAs. The CPU time was measured for computing aerodynamic coefficients of each mesh type.

The mean diameter at the inlet and outlet of the ducts are equal to the duct's chord length set to 22 cm, which is the size of the actual models in this research. The free stream velocity is set to U=15 m/s at the inlet boundary of domain. As expected, the process time for mesh with higher number of cells was too long. The mesh with 849,339 cells is in moderate calculation time and its results are reasonably close to the finer mesh, as shown in Figure 3-8.

Based on

the required precision level and computation time limitations for different mesh sizes, the moderate mesh is selected for CFD simulations of the symmetrical duct. In addition, the specification of moderate mesh is used to create other models for this study (asymmetrical duct without fan/rotor, 28

and symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans), which are listed in Table 3.2. The details of geometry, number of spatial and interval sizes for different edges of the meshes for both ducts with/without fans are presented in Appendix B.

3.7 Proposed method to calculate the inlet flow velocity to the ducted fans The proposed method for calculating the inlet flow velocity to the ducted fans is based on the actuator disk model [18] and the assumption of constant power delivered to the propeller to change the linear momentum of the inlet flow to the rotor plane in each case. First of all, this method provides a trial and error procedure to calculate the exact value for induced velocity (


) in cruise

condition by using ANSYS-Fluent software. Then, the assumption of constant induced power delivered to the propeller in all AoAs provides a cubic polynomial equation of the induced velocity (
 

. Therefore, as

) is a function of AoA, so are ducted fan's thrust and ram drag. 29

The balance of forces in a steady level flight for proposed VTOL UAV in the x-direction can be described by the following equation:  = - = (in steady level flight condition)

Step 1: Finding  in the cruise condition

3.8 Verification of the CFD method The verification of the CFD modeling are presented in the Chapter 4 (Sections 4.2 and 4.6) and as a preapproval of the method in this research, the velocity distribution of the flow around the symmetrical ducted fan in crosswind was simulated in this section. The selected parameters for simulation were based on the CFD simulations by Fleming et al. [9] and their results are illustrated in Figure 3-12. The results from this research are shown in Figure 3-13.

Figure 3-12: Duct wake bending with increasing crossflow. Progression is from 0 to 30 knots (equal to 0 to 15.43 m/s), 12 psf disks loading modeled (equal to 574.6 N/m2 or 15.314 m/s of inlet flow velocity to the duct). Range of color contours is 0 to 136 ft/sec. [9]

Both simulations predicted an unusual increase in the velocity over the windward duct lip, which creates an unbalanced lift force at the inlet of the duct and generates pitching moment. The similarity of the results between the two simulations is the first verification for the CFD method of this research.

3.9 Aerodynamics of tilting ducted fans The large increment in the AoA has extensive effects on the flow behaviour around a ducted fan. Assume a ducted fan with high AoA in the freestream with a velocity of as illustrated in

Figure 3-14. One part of oncoming flow has to enter the ducted fan normal to the rotor plane. The change in the direction of the oncoming flow is equal to the ducted fan's AoA. At the exit of the ducted fan, the outgoing jet impacts the mainstream flow with the angle equal to the ducted fan's AoA. Sharp turns of the flow into the rotor plane and at the exit of the duct in higher AoAs result in the unsteady flow separation around duct lip and strong swirling vorticities at the duct exit [26].

Figure 3-14: Flow streamlines combined with contour of vorticity on the xy plane around the symmetrical ducted fan 36

More than that, in higher AoAs, the duct body acts the same as a cylinder and flow separation occurs behind the duct [27]. All these are reasons for vortex shedding and large disturbances in the pressure distribution around the duct in higher AoAs. These large disturbances cause cyclic changes in the pressure forces around the duct in higher AoAs, especially close to the duct lips and rotor plane. The rate of change in the AoA ( =  = / ) is another important parameter affecting the

occurrence of the disturbances in the pressure distribution around a tilting ducted fan. Although the disturbance in the pressure distribution in the stationary condition is a function of AoA, in the transition condition it will be affected by the rate of change in the AoA too. The larger rate of changes in the AoA () will cause more unexpected fluctuations in the pressure distribution during transition periods. The fluctuations in the pressure distribution causes sudden changes in the aerodynamic forces, and this will be shown in the next chapter by using CFD simulations.

Tilting ducted fan VTOL UAV in transition condition

An important part of this research is the study of transition between cruise mode and hover of the proposed VTOL UAV. Maintaining in a level flight during transition is a necessity, but it can be difficult due to rapid changes in the VTOL UAV's velocity and the aerodynamic coefficients of the tilting ducted fans. These rapid changes generate transitional pitching moment and affect the AoA of the VTOL UAV. The final result could be a rapid ascending combined with stall condition or a rapid descending. The focus of this section is on the stability of the proposed VTOL UAV during transition from cruise mode to hover by using two different types of tilting ducted fans (one symmetrical and one asymmetrical).

37

The resultant aerodynamic forces and pitching moment acting on the proposed VTOL UAV in transition can be found by knowing the speed of VTOL UAV and the characteristics of each component such as wing, horizontal and vertical stabilizers, fuselage and tilting ducted fans. In this research, the aerodynamic coefficients of fixed components were assumed as constant parameters. Figure 3-15 shows the selected coordinate system and aerodynamic forces acting on the proposed VTOL UAV in transition between cruise condition and hover.

Figure 3-15: Coordinate system and aerodynamic forces acting on the proposed typical VTOL UAV

Assuming that the aerodynamic centre of the wing is exactly located above the centre of the gravity of the proposed VTOL UAV with the vertical distance of  , and assuming zero lift and

pitching moment coefficients for the fuselage, then, the general form of the resultant aerodynamic forces and pitching moments in a level flight during transition can be expressed as follows:  =  = cos  -

The following assumptions have been made to have a level flight during transition from cruise mode to hover: 1- The transition starts by reduction in the thrust of two ducted fans.

39

2- At the same time, two ducted fans start tilting about their tilting axis with constant tilting rate ().

3- The thrust of the rotors and the angle of tail's elevator were selected as the only controllable parameters during transition. Reduction in the thrust of ducted fans is necessary, as the summation of the wing's lift and vertical component of the thrust ( sin  ) causes a sudden ascending of the VTOL UAV at the

starting of the transition. Tilting rate for ducted fans should be selected at the first step (e.g.  = VTOL UAV's velocity affects lift, drag and pitching moments of different components of the VTOL UAV. Necessity of remaining in the level flight means any additional generated pitching moments by other components should be canceled by using tail's elevator, and this will guaranty no changes in the AoA for VTOL UAV.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 CFD simulations for symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts without fans To have a better comparison between symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts, simulations are first performed for ducts without fans. A symmetrical and an asymmetrical ducts are modeled as shown in Figure 4-1 and simulated by using standard =15 m/s and tilting angles of - °     -  turbulence modeling in steady flow with U ° (with ° increments in the AoA).

It can be seen that in the absence of the fans both ducts have the same trends for all aerodynamic coefficients. Also and of the

symmetrical duct are very close to those for the asymmetrical duct. The most important result is obtained from the lift diagram shown in Figure 4-2a, which shows the asymmetrical duct has 41

As a comparison between the two ducts, although the high curvature of the upper surface of the

asymmetrical duct is in charge of higher lift generation in low AoAs, the specific shape of its lower surface is responsible for capturing more momentum from the passing flow in higher AoAs. This specific shape causes a reduction in the flow velocity close to the lower surface, which increases the local static pressure around that location in higher AoAs. This mechanism helps the asymmetrical duct to generate higher lift in the wide range of AoAs. 44

4.2 Experimental validation of the CFD results for ducts without fans To validate the CFD results, the actual models of symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts used in the CFD analysis are designed and produced using CATIA software and a 3D printer, as shown in Figure 4-5 and as explained in Appendix C. The specifications of the two ducts are listed in Table 3.3. The supporting frame was designed for attaching ducts to it, providing tilting motion for ducts through a gear system, and measuring AoA by a ° protractor. The additional mechanism for

measuring the pitching moment was added to the supporting frame after measuring the lift and drag of the models, as shown in Figure 4-6. The ducts were installed in the large wind tunnel at Ryerson University with a × cm test section (for more information see Appendix D).

Flow velocity is set to 15 m/s same as CFD simulations, which provides Re=226,000 during wind tunnel tests. Each test was repeated three times to have accurate data and error analysis was done to validate the accuracy of measuring aerodynamic coefficients for both ducts without fans (see Appendix G). The experimental results are compared with the CFD results in the following figures. Figure 4-7 illustrates the comparison of the , , and from experiments with the CFD

method for the symmetrical duct without a fan in Re=226,000. Both experimental and CFD results show the same trends. The lift coefficient from the CFD simulation is very close to the experimental lift coefficient.

side lips is the main reason for higher experimental

°, the existence of flow separation at the duct's lower in the higher AoAs. The disruption of the

flow around the lower side lips of the asymmetrical duct causes greater differences between CFD and experimental values of which may continue up to  = °, as shown in Figure 4-8c. This

difference was reported by Fleming et al. as well, and the most likely explanation for the difference is flow separation around the windward duct lip was not captured in the CFD simulations [9]. Skin friction at the lower AoAs and the test section wall effects at higher AoAs are two reasons for the differences between the values of the experimental and the CFD drags. As described before,

the CFD models consist of a 3D spherical domain with a radius of 10 characteristic duct chord lengths, and the test section of the wind tunnel has a cross section close to × characteristic duct

chord length. This means the CFD models have a cross section 18 times larger than the wind tunnel test section.

The flow separation combined with ram drag and thrust variations will have larger effects on the pressure distribution and aerodynamic forces for ducted fans, as will be discussed in following sections.

4.4 The CFD simulations for symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans In this section, two meshes for symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans (see Table 3.2) are designed as shown in Figure 4-10.

It can be seen that both ducted fans have the same trends for all resultant forces and pitching moments. In addition,  and  of the symmetrical ducted fan are very close to those for the asymmetrical

ducted fan (see Figure 4-11b and Figure 4-9c). It was shown in Figure 4-2a that the asymmetrical body shape can generate additional lift compared to the symmetrical body shape. This result is repeated here again for ducted fans. The  diagram (see Figure 4-11a) proves that the asymmetrical ducted fan has higher generated lift than the symmetrical ducted fan.

As listed in Table 4.2, the asymmetrical ducted fan uses 5% more power than the symmetrical ducted fan to generate 4.3% more thrust. Although the asymmetrical ducted fan generated higher drag in this simulation, it could generate significant additional lift (1.856 N), which can help in designing a smaller wing and reducing overall drag of the VTOL UAV.

52

As illustrated in Figure 4-11c, both ducted fans have almost the same overall pitching moments. The ram drag has a noticeable role in producing pitching moment in the transition. To reduce pitching moment due to ram drag during transition from cruise mode to hover, it is necessary to move the tilting axis location from the middle of the duct closer to the rotor plane (or somewhere between the rotor plane and the aerodynamic centre of the ducts). The contours of pressure around the ducted fans are shown in Figure 4-12 for a wide range of AoAs. The contours of pressure on the plane of symmetry around two ducted fans for   = °

are also presented in Figure 4-13. As it was explained for the asymmetrical duct without a fan, the

high curvature of the upper surface is in charge of the higher lift generation in the low AoAs. In addition, the specific shape of the lower surface is responsible for capturing more momentum from the passing flow in the higher AoAs. This specific shape causes a reduction in the flow velocity close to the lower surface, which increases the local static pressure around that location in higher AoAs. As a result, this mechanism helps the asymmetrical duct to generate the higher lift in the wide range of AoAs.

by the wind tunnel measuring system for whole combinations of ducted fans attached to the supporting frame. Next, the supporting frame's drag ( ), and pitching moment

due to the ducted fans' weights in different AoAs, were subtracted from recorded gross forces and pitching moments to obtain the net forces and pitching moments acting on the ducted fans by using equations (3.25)-(3.29) and (3.34). The measured pitching moments due to the weight of ducts with/without fans in different AoAs are presented in Appendix F. The CFD simulations provided net aerodynamic forces and pitching moments based on the pressure distribution around the ducted fans (without the effects of the ducts' weight and supporting frames). Thrust and ram drag were then calculated based on the inlet flow velocity to 56

Next, the vertical and horizontal components of calculated thrust and ram drag and generated pitching moments were added to simulated aerodynamic forces and pitching moments to obtain the final CFD results. The comparison between experimental and CFD results are shown for different ducted fans in the following figures. Figure 4-16 illustrates the comparison of  ,  , and  from

As expected and predicted by CFD modeling, the lift coefficient of the asymmetrical ducted fan is higher than that for the symmetrical ducted fan.

The wing has the main role of lift generation. In addition, the elevators provide longitudinal stability by balancing pitching moments about the centre of gravity of the aircraft. The wing's lift and tail's pitching moment are functions of AoA and freestream velocity ( = / and

operate efficiently only if the proposed VTOL UAV flies higher than a specific cruise velocity. As shown in Figure 4-18, ducted fans' lift and drag increase as AoA increases during transition from cruise mode to hover. An increment in drag force results in decrement in the velocity of aircraft, decrement of lift generations by wing, and pitching moment by the horizontal tail. In order 61

to have a level flight and for compensation of the loss in the wing's lift, it is necessary to increase thrust in higher AoAs. This could be done only by increasing the power delivered to the propeller. An increment in the power and induced velocity of incoming flow to the rotor plane will change all aerodynamic forces and pitching moments, thrust, ram drag and its related pitching moment. Thus, it is necessary to provide all forces and pitching moments by real time calculations. The most important parameter for real time calculation is the angular velocity ( =  ) of tilting ducted fans attached to the wing tips. The aerodynamic response of the proposed VTOL UAV during transition condition is out of the scope of this research and it is another area that requires more investigation. To have an initial pattern for changes in the resultant forces and pitching moments of the proposed VTOL UAV, changes in the aerodynamic coefficients of symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans are compared in Figure 4-20 for tilting rate of  = /sec. These coefficients are

calculated for tilting ducted fans in the uniform flow field with

to 120o for AoA by running ANSYS-Fluent software in transient mode (see Appendix H). These

parameters were calculated previously in stationary conditions and their comparisons are shown in Figure 4-14. As can be seen, the fluctuations in aerodynamic coefficients during transition from cruise mode to hover happens when AoA is larger than 40o (  > ) for symmetrical ducted fan. This > ). These

happens for asymmetrical ducted fan when AoA is larger than 50o ( 

fluctuations cannot be captured in stationary conditions by CFD simulation, which were shown in all previous sections. Comparing transitional and stationary CFD simulations shows trends for changes in aerodynamic coefficients are similar and they are most likely in similar values.

The separation of flow around the windward duct lip has strong effects on distortion of the velocity magnitude at the duct's inlet [11]. The occurrence of cyclic fluctuations in aerodynamic forces can be expressed by following three main reasons: 1- The non-uniform flow separation in higher AoAs starts from the leading edge of the duct lip and generates strong vorticities. 2- These strong vorticities distort the streamlines of the flow toward the rotor plane and generate strong turbulent fluctuations around the duct lip and in the plane of the rotor. 3- The turbulent fluctuation affects pressure distribution at the rotor plane and generates cyclic disturbance in the aerodynamic forces of the ducted fan. As shown in Figure 4-23, the cyclic disturbance in the aerodynamic coefficients affects the resultant forces and pitching moment of the ducted fans and creates sudden shakes by increasing AoA during transition period. These sudden shakes were observed even in the stationary conditions for higher AoAs in the range of °    ° in the wind tunnel experiments.

As it was shown in Figure 4-22, changes in the tilting rate affected both lift and drag coefficients, and it was expected to have disturbances in both vertical and horizontal components of the resultant forces, as shown in Figure 4-23. According to Figure 4-22, increment in the tilting rate increases the amplitude of the fluctuations in the aerodynamic coefficients for both ducted fans. The amplitudes of these fluctuations are relatively larger for symmetrical ducted fan as its curvature on the upper side is less than that on the asymmetrical ducted fan. Thus, the separated flow has stronger effects on the symmetrical ducted fan.

The specifications of the proposed VTOL UAV with two ducted fans installed on its wing tips are listed in Table I. 1. The details for calculation of the specifications are presented in the Appendix I. Based on the selected tilting rate () and type of ducted fan, the provided MATLAB 67

codes (see Appendix J) calculate the proposed VTOL UAV's velocity by using trial and error method to satisfy equation (3.45). The final travelled time for completing transition from cruise mode to hover for proposed VTOL UAV by using two different ducted fans and for three different tilting rates are presented in the Table 4.3.

fans during transition for different tilting rates. There is no major difference between tilting angles of the symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans for each specific tilting rate. The tilting angle should pass ° to create essential braking force for stopping the VTOL UAV.

Figure 4-24: The variation of tilting angle of the ducted fans during transition for symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans in three different tilting rates ( = , & /sec) 68

By increasing tilting rate, the transition can be done in shorter time and this needs larger braking force, which can be produced in the higher tilting angles. The maximum tilting angle for each ducted fan in different tilting rates are listed in the Table 4.4. As shown in the Figure 4-24, ducted fans have to come back to  = ° in the last step of transition to get into stable hover condition.

Distance travelled during transition: As illustrated in Figure 4-25, the travelled distance during transition is shorter (max. 2.5%) by applying higher tilting rates. The travelled distance is relatively shorter by using asymmetrical ducted fan for proposed VTOL UAV.

Thrust works like a braking force during transition to reduce the VTOL UAV's velocity. Although each engine should produce 18.058 N force in hover, they need to produce higher thrust (up to 15%) to stop the VTOL UAV during transition in a shorter distance.

Changes in the pitching moment: Figure 4-29 shows additional generated pitching moment during transition from cruise mode to hover of the proposed VTOL UAV in this research. This transitional pitching moment is generated due to the changes in the aerodynamic forces and pitching moments of the wing, tilting ducted fans, and other components. The asymmetrical ducted fan with larger tilting rates generates higher transitional pitching moments compare to the symmetrical ducted fan. The additional generated pitching moment should be cancelled by tail's elevator during transition, as it can increase the AoA of the VTOL UAV in a short time and change level flight to a sudden ascending flight, which can be ended with a stall condition.

Figure 4-29: The changes in the pitching moments during transition by using symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans in three different tilting rates ( = , & /sec) As it illustrated in the Figure 4-29, the proposed VTOL UAV with symmetrical ducted fan has been affected by larger fluctuations in the transitional pitching moments and in the higher tilting rates. These fluctuations in the transitional pitching moments are results of flow separation and turbulence fluctuation when tilting angle of the symmetrical ducted fan is in the range of  < ° as discussed before in the section 3.9. 72 °<

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS

5.1 Conclusion In this research, the aerodynamics of two ducts (one symmetrical and one asymmetrical) were studied by CFD and experimental methods in different conditions. The aerodynamic forces and pitching moment acting on these two ducts were compared to find out the advantages and disadvantages of using them as tilting ducted fan installed on the wing tips of the proposed VTOL UAV in this research. Using this configuration of the ducted fans can minimize the angle between the thrust line and flight path of the VTOL UAV. This enhancement provides uniform flow to the rotor disk, higher thrust, less drag, and faster forward velocity, which results in longer range and endurance in cruise mode. Four objectives were defined in this research as follows: 1- Investigation for the use of asymmetrical shape for the external body of ducted fans, 2- Prediction of the induced velocity of the inlet flow to the rotor plane, to conduct CFD modeling for ducted fans, 3- Using CFD modeling for predicting aerodynamic forces and pitching moments of the tilting ducted fans in the transition conditions for different tilting rates, 4- Simulation of the level flight conditions of the proposed VTOL UAV during transition between cruise mode and hover. It was necessary to define several procedures to obtain CFD simulations and experimental tests in this research. Different meshes were designed using GAMBIT software to perform CFD simulations for the two tilting ducts with/without fans in different conditions. The all CFD simulations were performed in steady flow with U = in the range of - °     °. 73 m/s and Re = , and tilting angle

To conduct the experiments, the actual models of two ducts were designed and printed using CATIA software and a 3D printer. A supporting frame was designed for attaching ducts to it, providing tilting motion for ducts through a gear system and measuring AoA by a ° protractor.

By connecting the supporting frame to the load measuring system of the wind tunnel, lift, drag, and pitching moments of two ducts with/without fans could be recorded in stationary conditions for the same range of AoAs and free stream velocity were used in the CFD modeling. For the first objective of this research, the ANSYS-Fluent software simulated the aerodynamic forces and pitching moment acting on the ducts without fan in stationary conditions for a wide range of AoAs by using standard -  turbulence modeling.

Then, the ducts without fans were tested in the wind tunnel. The lift, drag, and pitching moment from experiments were compared with the CFD results showing good agreements between the two methods. The results from both methods show that the external shape of the asymmetrical duct has the main role of generating higher lift in cruise mode and a wide range of AoAs (- °    

to the smaller curvature of the lower surface of the asymmetrical duct, its pitching moment is slightly higher than that for the symmetrical duct during the transition in the range of °.

The second objective needed to calculate the induced velocity to the rotor plane of the ducted

fans by assuming constant power delivered to the propeller and using actuator disk model. Then, by using the calculated values for induced velocity in different AoAs, the aerodynamic forces and pitching moments of ducted fans were obtained in stationary conditions using ANSYS-Fluent software. These CFD simulations were done in steady flow for the same conditions of all the tests and using RNG (Re-Normalisation Group) -  turbulence modeling. The fan's thrust, ram drag 74

and its related pitching moment were calculated using direct equations and added to aerodynamic forces and pitching moments of ducted fans to obtain final resultant horizontal and vertical forces and pitching moments in the CFD simulations. To evaluate the CFD results, the ducts were equipped with electromotor and propellers, and tested in different AoAs in the wind tunnel. The experimental horizontal and vertical forces and pitching moment of the ducted fans were compared with the resultant forces and pitching moment from the CFD modeling, and satisfactory agreements between the two methods were observed. The third objective was achieved using the ANSYS-Fluent software in transient mode. The resultant horizontal and vertical forces and pitching moments of two tilting ducted fans were obtained in three different tilting rates ( = , & deg/sec). The unexpected cyclic

turbulent fluctuations in the aerodynamic forces and pitching moments were observed for both ducted fans in the higher AoAs. Increment in the tilting rate increased the amplitude of the fluctuations, which relatively are larger for symmetrical ducted fan. Finally, the fourth objective was achieved by designing the proposed VTOL UAV with two ducted fans installed on its wing tips. The resultant aerodynamic forces and pitching moments acting on the proposed VTOL UAV were calculated in three different tilting rates and using two different types of ducted fans. The final results showed asymmetrical ducted fans can provide smoother transition flight between cruise mode and hover. The final findings of this research can be listed as following: 1. Due to the specific shape, the asymmetrical ducted fan can generate additional lift in cruise mode, which can help to reduce wing area and the consequent weight and drag. This enhancement will help to increase the range and endurance of the flight for the VTOL UAV.

5.2 Contributions The main area of the contribution of this research is in the aerodynamics of asymmetrical ducted fans. Many activities were done to show the advantage of using asymmetrical ducted fan in this research. As it was mentioned before, to the best of my knowledge, there was no specific published study for using an asymmetrical shape for external body of the ducted fans. The contribution of this research can be summarized in the following categories: 1. Application of asymmetrical ducted fan: Results from the experiments and CFD modeling showed asymmetrical shape can be used for the external body of ducted fans to generate additional lift in cruise mode. This can help to reduce wing area and the consequent weight and drag. More than that, the aerodynamically performance of asymmetrical ducted fan in transition from cruise mode to hover is better than symmetrical ducted fan. 2. Methodology development: This involved the combination of "actuator disk model" combined with the assumption of "constant power delivered to the propeller" to calculate the induced velocity to the rotor plane of the ducted fans. This is essential for studying the aerodynamic coefficients of ducted fans in different AoAs when a large amount of the air

76

is forced to pass through the ducted fan. This model was used to obtain the aerodynamic coefficients of tilting ducted fans in different tilting rates and study the effects of the tilting rate changes. 3. Prediction, analysis and validation: Both symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans were studied by CFD simulations and experiments. The experimental results validated both the CFD modeling and the method for predicting induced velocity to the rotor plane of the ducted fans.

5.3 Future work Future works can be research on the following topics: 1- Optimization of the ducted fans (inlet and outlet diameters, length of the ducts, profile of the airfoils for symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts, ...) 2- Experiments on the unsteady aerodynamics of the actual model of tilting ducted fans and effects of changes in their tilting rates 3- Experiments on the stability and control of an actual model of the proposed VTOL UAV during different maneuvers such as yaw in hover and roll and steady banked turn in cruise mode and also transition between cruise mode and hover.

Most of commercial codes simulate the turbulent boundary layer by using standard eddy viscosity models. These models 80 Eligibility of using  -  turbulence modeling in the separated flow

cannot capture the non-equilibrium effects in the adverse pressure gradient [31]. Thus, using any turbulence modeling for the problems with the occurrence of separation and in the adverse pressure gradient could be challenge. In this research, the flow separation around the ducts without fans has two following effects on the lift and drag: 1- Reduction in the lift happens after possible stall and flow separation around symmetrical duct at   = ° (see Figure A. 1a): The -  turbulence modeling predicted that at the ° and its calculated lift is very closer to the -  and -  turbulence modeling -  -

Although there is no unique turbulence modeling for all CFD problems, each model can solve some specific problems accurately. In this research, using the -  turbulence modeling showed

better results than the other methods. It may not predict the exact location and the effects of the

flow separation, which is generally the weakness of most of turbulence modeling, but the overall results are closer to the experiments.

Wall function for wall-bounded turbulent flow Turbulent flow will be affected by the presence of walls due to the viscosity of the fluid and changes in the mean velocity field close to the wall. The near wall region can be divided into three

81

sublayers. In the laminar or viscous sublayer, which is attached to the wall, the molecular viscosity plays the main role in momentum, heath, and mass transfer. In the outer sublayer, named fully turbulent layer, turbulence plays the main role. Between these two sublayer, the buffer layer is another sublayer with the mixed effects of molecular viscosity and turbulence [21].  + and   are two dimensionless distance from the wall. These parameters are good scales for -  and the RNG -  turbulence

Appendix B: Geometry of meshes

Geometry of meshes for symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts without fan The external body of symmetrical duct was created by revolving the upper side of NACA 0012 airfoil, as shown in Figure 3-3. The external body of asymmetrical duct consists of different profiles of high lift FX 63-137 airfoil, as shown in Figure 3-4. The upper side profile of FX 63-137 airfoil is applied at ° on

the upper side of the asymmetrical duct. Also the lower side profile of FX 63-137 airfoil is applied at ° on the lower side of the asymmetrical duct. There are two similar smooth transitional

regions on the left and right sides of the duct to connect lower part to upper part.

The internal bodies for both symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts are similar, as shown in Figure 3-3b and Figure 3-4d. To reduce the number of parameters which have effects on this research, the mean diameters at the duct inlet/outlet are set equal to the duct chord length ( = ) for both The grid generation for all meshes have been done using GAMBIT software. The 3-D meshes for ducts without fans were created by assuming circle with radius of = = = as characteristic length. Then a half-

was assumed and revolved about the x-axis to create a sphere surface

as outer boundary. The selected models are tilting about the z-axis and as a result the xy plane is the plane of symmetry for simulations. The solid external and internal faces of ducts and spherical surface of the outer boundary consist of triangular cells. The volume between outer boundary and duct consists of tetrahedron cells with triangular faces. These volumetric cells are very fine around the duct's surfaces and become coarse as they go farther from ducts.

Appendix C: Designing, producing, and preparing actual models of ducted fans

The actual models of ducted fans were designed by using CATIA 5 software in the "Computer Lab" of Ryerson University. The designs were the same as the CFD models by Gambit software, but the generated "stl" files could be used by a 3D printer to produce the models from the "Ivory ABS Sparse Material". The designed models are shown in Figure C. 1.

Appendix E: Measuring aerodynamic forces on the frame and ducts with/without fans

All models tested consist of two major components: ducted fans (electromotor + 8"x6" 3-bladed propeller + connecting rods + ducts) and supporting frame (aluminum supports + tilting gear motor + ° protractor) to connect ducts to the load measuring system.

The protractor provided good reading of the AoA with the error of reading less than 0.5 degree. The flow velocity inside the test section of the wind tunnel can be found by calculating the dynamic pressure of the flow. There is a pitot tube inside the test section which is connected to a manometer outside the test section.

Appendix F: Measuring pitching moments of the ducts' weights

The centre of gravity for both symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts are not located on the tilting axis. Then, their weights generate pitching moments about tilting axis. The pitching moments due to ducts' weight were measured for both symmetrical and asymmetrical ducts with/without fans during experiments. Then, these pitching moments were subtracted from the gross measured pitching moments to obtain the net aerodynamic pitching moment in different AoAs for each duct.

Ducts without fans Both ducts were printed from "Ivory ABS Sparse Material" with density of 1.06 gr/cm3. The mass of symmetrical duct is 1.437 kg and its weight is 14.092 N. The mass of asymmetrical duct is 1.306 kg and its weight is 12.808 N. The pitching moments due to the weight of each duct in different AoAs were measured during tests, as shown in Figure F. 1. The centre of gravity of symmetrical duct is located on the line of symmetry and maximum pitching moment due to its weight is -0.1356 N.m, which occurs at   = ° (or 0.1356 N.m at   = to its weight is -0.3446 N.m, which occurs at   = - °).

Appendix G: Error analysis for measuring aerodynamic coefficients

The error of reading of quantities during any experiment should be clarified to show the accuracy of the measurements. Two sources of errors for measuring aerodynamic coefficients of tilting ducts in the wind tunnel were reading of loads (lift, drag and pitching moment) and  of the manometer. The accuracy for reading these quantities are shown in the Table G. 1.

The effects of the error during reading these quantities on the calculation of aerodynamic coefficients can be described by using equations (3.42), (3.43), (3.44), and (E.2). For example, for error on the lift calculation: = =

Appendix H: Summary of ANSYS-Fluent settings in the transient mode and User Defined Functions

Summary of ANSYS-Fluent settings in transient mode To complete all simulations during this project, ANSYS-Fluent has been used nearly 200 times. Entering the right amounts for parameters and choosing the right setting for software can save time and give the right answers for each simulation. This will be more important if users find out it takes more than 24 hours to complete one transient simulation. To start ANSYS-Fluent in "Transient Mode", both mesh and UDF files must be in the same working directory. The final results (cl-history, cd-history and cm-history) will be saved in the same working directory. The following are steps for running ANSYS-Fluent to find , and of symmetrical ducted / ,

Now ANSYS-Fluent starts working and will stop after finishing 1800 time steps. Results will be saved in cl-history, cd-history and cm-history files in the working directory. There are many other tools (like creating an Animation File or pictures for different properties of the fluid/case by using ANSYS-CFD Post) which readers can find in the ANSYS-Fluent and ANSYS-CFD Post manuals.

User Defined Functions The ANSYS-Fluent software was used to compute lift, drag and pitching moment of tilting ducted fans in this research. Simulations were performed in stationary and transition conditions. In stationary condition, the AoA and main stream velocity were set as constants and then the velocity of the inlet flow to rotor plane was set as another constant based on the selected AoA. The aerodynamic coefficients were recorded at the end of iterations for each AoA. In transition condition, when ducted fans were tilting with specific tilting rate, all these were done automatically by using User Defined Functions (UDF). Time is the input variable to each UDf codes calculating tilting angle, main stream velocity and the velocity of the inlet flow to the rotor plane. The following C++ programs were used for defining tilting angle and the velocity of the inlet flow to the rotor plane for both symmetrical and asymmetrical ducted fans. The final aerodynamic coefficients were saved in three different files for each case. Readers can change some parameters of these codes to conduct simulations for different tilting rate or different velocity for the inlet flow to the rotor plane. Readers should note that ANSYSFluent uses "Radians" for unit of angles to calculate trigonometric functions. More information about UDF files can be found in ANSYS-Fluent manual [21].

Appendix J: MATLAB code for calculating flight parameters of proposed VTOL UAV during transition between cruise mode to hover

The following MATLAB code was used to calculate 9 parameters during transition between cruise mode and hover of the proposed VTOL UAV as follows: 1- Ducted fans parameters: Tilting angle (), Thrust (T), Induced velocity to the rotor plane ( 2- Dynamic parameters of VTOL UAV: Travelled distance (x), Flight velocity (U), Braking deceleration ( ), Changes in altitude (z), and Transitional pitching moment.


), and Induced power to the rotor (P).

The specification of VTOL UAV (see Table I. 1) with two symmetrical ducted fans installed on its wing tips were used to obtain this code. The reader can change tilting rate or type of ducted fan to calculate those 9 parameters in other conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients of tilting symmetrical ducted fan with tilting rate of  = / were stored in "Symduct10.txt" file

and were used in the following MATLAB code.
