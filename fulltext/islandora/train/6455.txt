AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP:  SOLUTIONS  FOR  ALLEVIATING  MISSISSAUGA'S   AFFORDABLE  HOUSING  ISSUE   ©  Jennifer  Ormiston,  2017      Master  of  Planning   In   Urban  Development   Ryerson  University         ABSTRACT      This  research  looks  at  literature,  market  trends,  and  policies  and  programs  pertaining  to  affordable   homeownership.  The  literature  suggests  that  homeownership  contributes  to  local  economies  and   quality  of  life  and  is  an  important  part  of  creating  vibrant  societies.  This  research  is  important  as   planning  plays  a  vital  role  in  representing  those  who  cannot  represent  themselves  and  ensuring  that  a   high  quality  of  life  is  accessible  to  everyone.  It  explores  the  affordable  housing  issue  in  Mississauga  and   identifies  the  programs  that  currently  exist  to  alleviate  affordable  housing  issues.  The   recommendations  are  intended  to  guide  Mississauga  in  the  next  steps  of  alleviating  affordable   homeownership  issues.    The  recommendations  provided  are  transient  and  can  be  used  as  a  template   for  other  municipalities  in  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  alleviate  similar  issues.                    Key  words:   1.  A  paper  on  alleviating  affordable  homeownership  issues  in  Mississauga,  used  the  key  words:   affordable,  homeownership,  Mississauga,  affordability  issue.

1.  OVERVIEW  

1.   OVERVIEW   1.1.  Introduction  
   Homeownership  is  one  of  the  largest  purchases  a  household  will  make  in  its  lifetime.  It  not  only   provides  a  basis  for  securing  a  home  and  accumulating  assets,  it  is  often  the  main  form  of  savings   (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002;  Hou,  2010;  McKee,  2012;  Begley,  2017).  Along  with  wealth-building,   homeownership  has  associated  societal  benefits  relating  the  physical  appearance  of  the  property,   creating  a  better  environment  for  the  surrounding  area  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002),  improved  quality  of   life  and  contributes  to  local  economies.  In  many  places,  homeownership  is  a  symbol  of  social   acceptance  and  a  marker  of  membership  in  mainstream  society  (McKee,  2012).  It  is  said  to  be  "the   cornerstone  of  a  vibrant  society"  (Swidler,  2011).  Homeownership  is  a  complex  concept  and  may  not  fit   the  needs  of  every  household;  like  anything,  there  are  benefits  and  contraints  that  may  attract  or  deter   households  from  becoming  homeowners.        This  paper  explores  literature  relating  to  housing  affordability  and  the  concerns  associated  with  it,   including  affordable  homeowership  and  affordable  rental.  However,  this  paper  specifcally  focuses  on   affordable  ownership  in  Mississauga.  It  explores  homeownership,  through  factors  that  may  influence   tenure  choices,  affordable  housing  options  as  well  as  the  importance  of  affordability.  This  paper  looks   at  the  housing  trends  in  the  City  of  Mississauga  over  the  past  20  years,  focusing  on  changes  in  tenure,   population  growth  and  employment  growth.  Using  Mississauga  as  a  case  study,  affordable  housing   options  currently  available  both  on  a  governement  and  non-profit  level  is  explored  as  well  as  the   potential  for  other  options  within  the  municipality.  Through  understanding  Mississauga's  history,   housing  policies  and  the  city's  affordability  issue,  the  document  is  intended  to  provide   recommendations  to  alleviate  increasing  unaffordability.  The  recommendations  for  this  paper  are   tailored  to  fit  the  City  of  Mississauga  but  may  also  be  altered  to  apply  to  the  needs  of  other   municipalities  in  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  (GGHA)  that  face  similar  issues.      Overall,  this  document  is  intended  to  bring  an  understanding  to  affordable  housing  and  address  that   affordable  homeownership  is  an  important  part  of  creating  vibrant  and  sustainable  communities  and   offer  recommendations  that  can  guide  the  implementation  of  affordable  housing  initiatives.

1.  OVERVIEW  

1.2.  Importance  of  Research  
   Housing  is  an  important  aspect  of  life;  adequate,  affordable  and  suitable  housing  is  essential  for   ensuring  the  quality  of  life  of  all  citizens.  Understanding  the  fundamental  issues  associated  with   housing,  and  particularly  homeownership,  is  important  in  the  planning  realm.  Planning  plays  a  vital  role   in  representing  those  that  cannot  represent  themselves,  and  a  need  to  influence  policy  plans  for  future   populations  is  crucial  in  ensuring  high  quality  of  life  for  everyone.  This  research  is  intended  to  inform   readers  of  the  affordability  issues  associated  with  homeownership  and  housing  in  general.  It  hopes  to   enlighten  readers  on  the  programs  and  policies  that  currently  exist  and  find  gaps  where  improvements   can  be  made.  This  paper  uses  Mississauga  as  a  case  study  example  because  it  is  a  flourishing   municipality  within  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  (GGHA).  These  recommendations  are  intended   to  guide  Mississauga  and  other  municipalities  around  the  GGHA  to  alleviate  the  housing  affordability   issue.

2.  BACKGROUND  

2.   BACKGROUND   2.1.  Literature  Review  
   Homeownership  is  often  the  largest  investment  a  household  will  make  in  its  lifetime  (Painter  &   Redfearn,  2002)  and  does  not  come  without  associated  risks.  Although  owning  a  home  is  more  secure   than  renting,  in  many  ways,  it  is  still  not  100%  secured.  Homeownership  is  both  an  investment  and  a   consumable  good  for  the  owner,  and  solely  a  consumable  good  for  non-owners  within  a  household   (Hou,  2010).  It  is  an  asset  and  a  public  good  because  owners  and  non-owners  participate  in  consuming   the  services  provided  by  the  actual  house  (shelter)  and  by  the  surrounding  community  (amenities  in  the   neighbourhood)  (Hou,  2010).  Homeownership  is  a  social  benefit  and  is  often  the  greatest  source  of   savings  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002;  Hou,  2010;  McKee,  2012;  Begley,  2017).  It  is  not  just  an  investment   and  an  accumulation  of  personal  wealth  but,  "is  a  financial  resource  families  can  tap  into  across  the  life   cycle  to  meet  their  welfare  needs"  (McKee,  2012).  It  can  also  generate  "neighborhood  benefits  related   to  property  upkeep,  public  safety,  school  quality,  and  the  like"  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002).      The  literature  has  continuously  associated  homeownership  with  reduced  mobility  (Aaronson,  2000;   Dietz  &  Haurin,  2003;  Phang,  2010).  Higher  moving  costs  is  a  result  of  reduced  mobility  and  thus,   owners  tend  to  remain  in  the  same  neighbourhood  longer  than  renters  (Green  &  White,  1997).  This  may   encourage  owners  to  take  greater  responsibilities  for  their  families  and  surrounding  community  (Green   &  White,  1997).  This  greater  responsibility  is  brought  on  by  the  stake  that  homeowners  have  in  their   homes  (Green  &  White,  1997).  Homeowners  want  to  ensure  that  their  investment  maintains   attractiveness  and  when  they  do  decide  to  move  or  sell  that  capital  losses  are  avoided  (Green  &  White,   1997).  Aaronson  (2000)  discussed  how  low  mobility  neighbourhoods  have  positive  effects  on  children   and  their  learning.  Homeownership  also  suggests  a  more  stable  home  environment,  contributing  to  the   well-being  of  the  children  living  in  the  homes  (Green  &  White,  1997).  This  can  be  referred  back  to  the   concept  that  homeownership  is  not  just  an  investment  but  a  consumerable  good  that  contributes  to   overall  public  good.  Green  &  White  (1997)  suggest  that  children  of  homeowners  are  more  likely  to  stay   in  school,  achieve  a  higher  level  of  education  and  can  contribute  to  the  future  of  the  wider  society.   Moreover,  homeownership  contributes  to  the  viability  of  communities,  as  neighbourhoods  with  a  lower   homeownership  rate  generally  have  less  amenities  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002).

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  

  

2.  BACKGROUND  

Homeownership  comes  with  some  degree  of  risk,  especially  since  it  is  a  huge  invesment  and  accounts   for  the  majority  of  a  household's  investment  portfolio,  leaving  little  room  for  diversity,  increasing   overall  risk  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002;  Phang,  2010;  Sekkat  &  Szafarz,  2011).  Moreover,  purchasing  a   house  requires  a  large  upfront  cost,  and  one  of  the  biggest  barriers  that  prohibit  households  from   moving  into  ownership  from  the  rental  market  is  access  to  this  capital  (or  down  payment)  (Painter  &   Redfearn,  2002;  Dietz  &  Haurin,  2003;  Phang,  2010).  Some  literature  suggest  evidence  that  young   people's  life-cycle  consumptions  are  distorted  by  down  payment  saving  behaviours  (Dietz  &  Haurin,   2003;  McKee,  2012).  Without  assistance,  the  rising  house  prices  and  increased  amount  required  for   down  payment  will  continue  delaying  entrance  into  the  ownership  market  (McKee,  2012).  Rising  house   prices  and  large  down  payment  requirements  are  not  the  only  factors  contributing  to  delayed   homeownership  among  younger  generations.  Literature  suggests  that  young  people  are  also  delaying   homeownership  due  to  lengthening  education,  high  youth  unemployment,  increasing  levels  of  debt   and  restrictied  access  to  welfare  benefits  (McKee,  2012).  In  the  UK,  the  average  age  of  entering   homeownership  without  parental  assistance  is  37  years  old  (McKee,  2012).  Financial  assistance  from   relatives  has  become  necessary  in  helping  young  people  achieve  homeownership  (McKee,  2012).      Housing  choices,  are  no  longer  truly  choices,  they  are  shaped  by  wider  societal  structures,  which  impact   available  tenure  options  for  individuals  and  families  (McKee,  2012).  The  rising  prices  of  housing  has   impacted  the  ability  of  individuals  and  families  to  move  from  renting  to  owning  in  a  timely  manner.   While  at  equilibrium,  owning  is  preferred  over  renting,  the  large  investment  of  homeownership  is   associated  with  a  high  risk.  The  choice  of  tenure  is  associated  with  risk  appetite  and  behaviours  of   certain  households  (Sekkat  &  Szafarz,  2011).  For  example,  wealthy  households  may  have  a  higher  risk   appetite  because  they  may  have  some  capital  to  fall  back  as  a  safety  net,  whereas  lower  income   households  may  not  be  as  risky  because  there  is  no  safety  net  if  they  default  on  their  mortgage.   Literature  suggests  that  policy  should  guide  this  issue  and  create  options  to  facilitate  homeownership   for  younger  generations,  to  avoid  the  creation  of  a  lost  generation  (McKee,  2012).  The  behaviours  of   delayed  homeownership  and  renting  are  behaviours  that  are  brought  on  by  barriers  and  inabilities  to   enter  ownership,  posing  an  affordability  issue.      Homeownership  is  an  important  part  of  society  and  contributes  to  the  quality  of  life.  It  also  has   economic  benefits  and  contributes  to  the  local  economy.  The  housing  sector  plays  a  vital  role  in  the   economy,  in  many  developed  countries  (Rolnik,  2013).  Property  tax  is  one  of  the  largest  revenues

streams  of  municipalities  and  homeownership  can  contribute  to  increaseing  this  revenue.  Property  tax   is  comprised  of  the  assessed  property  value  and  tax  rates  established  by  the  municipality.  It  contributes   to  the  local  municipal  revenue,  the  regional  revenue  and  contributes  the  province  of  Ontario  for   educational  purposes  (City  of  Mississauga,  n.d.).  In  Mississauga,  for  example,  the  city  receives  31%  of   the  total  property  tax,  46%  goes  to  the  Region  of  Peel  and  23%  goes  to  the  Province  for  education.   Regardless  of  the  tenure  of  residents,  the  property  tax  will  be  received  by  the  municipality.  However,   increased  homeownership  contributes  to  increased  investment  in  the  neighbourhood  and  responsibility   of  the  home,  which  can  contribute  to  the  attractiveness  of  the  neighbourhood  and  potentially  add  to   the  overall  property  value.        Hulchanski  (2006)  discusses  the  importance  of  homeownership  as  households'  age.  Homeowners  have   something  to  draw  from  as  they  age,  they  can  downsize  and  sell  their  larger  home  for  something   smaller,  freeing  up  money,  whereas  long-term  renters  do  not  have  anything  to  draw  from  as  they  age   (Hulchanski,  2006).  The  Canadian  government  has  a  long  history  is  shaping  the  way  the  current  housing   system  functions,    and  largely  focus  on  the  homeownership  sector  (Hulchanski,  2006).  If  it  were  not  for   federal  policies  and  programs,  Canadian  homeownership  rates  would  be  much  lower  (Hulchanski,   2006).  The  growing  gap  between  rich  and  poor  has  been  particularly  apparent  in  the  housing  market  in   Canada.  Households  are  divided  into  two  distinct  groups  of  housing  consumers  (Hulchanski,  2006).  In   1996,  the  federal  government  transferred  housing  responsibilities  to  provinces  and  territories,  which   meant  that  federal  funding  was  withdrawn,  and  the  financial  burdens  were  downloaded  to  provincial   taxpayers  (Hulchanski,  2006).  However,  in  terms  of  ownership,  the  jurisdictional  discussion  is  generally   lacking  and  all  three  levels  of  government  jump  at  opportunities  to  assist  owners  (Hulchanski,  2006).  All   levels  of  government  privilege  homeowners;  the  federal  government's  housing  activities  through   budgetary  spending  programs  or  tax  expenditures  are  considered  incentives  and  entitlements  as  rights   associated  with  investing  in  and  owning  a  home  (Hulchanski,  2006).    In  Canada,  there  is  significant   benefit  in  being  a  homeowner  as  owner-occupied  houses  are  exempt  from  capital  gains  taxes,  which   generates  about  $3.7  billion  annually  (Hulchanski,  2006).  This  large  subsidy  is  only  offered  to   homeowners  and  there  is  no  equivalent  subsidy  available  for  private  renters  or  rental  housing  investors   (Hulchanski,  2006).  The  reason  for  the  federal  government  focus  on  homeowners  is  provide  and   produce  high  and  relatively  stable  levels  of  housing  starts.  This  contributes  to  overall  economic  growth   as  well  as  provide  many  well-paying  jobs  (Hulchanski,  2006).

2.  BACKGROUND  

The  following  section  describes  the  role  of  the  Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  discusses   information  about  homeownership  rates,  and  explores  the  housing  outlooks  in  Canada,  Ontario  and  the   GTA.  This  section  concludes  with  identifying  housing  affordability  issues.  

2.2.  Housing  Market   2.2.1.   Canada  
   The  Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation  (CMHC)  is  Canada's  authority  on  housing  and  are   responsible  for  helping  Canadians  meet  their  housing  needs  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing   Corporation,  2017).  CMHC  contributes  to  the  stability  of  the  housing  market  and  the  financial  systems   in  the  country,  they  provide  services  which  include  mortgage  loan  insurance,  first  nation  housing,   securitization,  affordable  housing,  policy  and  research  as  well  as  provide  Canadians  with  information  so   that  they  can  make  informed  decisions  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2017).  CMHC  was   established  in  1946  to  house  returning  war  veterans  and  to  lead  Canada's  housing  programs  (Canada   Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  n.d.).  The  main  purpose  of  CMHC  was  to  administer  the  National   Housing  Act,  the  Home  Improvement  Loans  Guarantee  Act  as  well  as  provide  discounting  mechanisms   for  loans  and  mortgage  companies  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  n.d.).  CMHC  has  had  a   long  history  of  serving  to  improve  the  lives  of  Canadians  through  housing.        Since  1971,  homeownership  rates  have  continued  to  increase.  Figure  1  represents  the  homeownership   rate  from  census  data  collected  between  1971  to  2011.  Increasing  ownership  can  partly  be  attributed  to   rising  incomes  in  Canada  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002),  but  also  factors  such  as  low  interest  rates  and  a   loosening  of  credit  restrictions  which  have  allowed  household's  to  increase  their  borrowing  capacities   (Cheung,  2014).  However,  the  ability  of  a  household  borrow  is  not  indicative  of  an  affordable  or   sustainable  market.  Despite  the  high  ownership  rate,  the  health  of  housing  in  Canada  has  been   deteriorating  rapidly.  Housing  price  increases  have  surpassed  increases  in  household  income,  which  has   contributed  to  the  difficultly  of  households  entering  the  ownership  market  (Cheung,  2014).  "Ownership   rates  do  not  capture  either  the  size  or  quality  of  housing"  that  are  occupied  by  households  (Swidler,   2011).  According  to  CMHC,  if  households  do  not  meet  any  of  the  three  housing  standards,  they  are   considered  in  `core  housing  need',  these  include,  affordability,  suitability  and  adequacy  (Canada   Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  Core  Housing  Need  is  defined  as  households  falling  below   at  least  one  of  these  standards  and  spending  more  than  30%  of  before  tax  income  on  housing  (Canada   Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).      6

   The  Housing  Market  Outlook  Report  released  by  CMHC  reflect  forecasts  and  data  up  until  the  end  of   September  2016.  This  report,  the  Housing  Market  Outlook  Report,  2016  looks  at  the  economic,   financial  and  housing  market  conditions  in  Canada  as  well  as  forecast  data  for  the  the  coming  years.   Overall,  housing  starts  in  the  country  have  been  declining  slightly  from  2015,  and  will  continue  declining   through  2017  before  stabilizing  in  2018  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  The  decline   in  housing  starts  reflects  a  decline  in  new  supply  throughout  the  country.  In  2016,  there  was  an  increase   in  Multiple  Listing  Service  (MLS)  resales,  but  due  to  changing  demographics  across  Canada,  the  number   of  resales  is  expected  to  decline  through  2018  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).   Understanding  the  shift  in  supply  both  new  and  resale  is  important  in  understanding  housing   affordability  as  well  as  access  to  affordable  housing  for  existing  and  potential  homeowners.  As  supply   and  demand  shift,  overvaluation  becomes  a  concern.  Overvaluation  refers  to  the  purchase  price   exceeding  the  fundamental  value  that  a  house  may  be  assessed  as  (Investopedia,  2017).  This  has   contributed  to  the  affordability  issue  as  many  houses  are  being  purchased  over  asking  price.  The  repeat   sales  index  refers  to  the  changing  prices  for  the  same  piece  of  real  estate  (Investopedia,  2017).  This  is  an

accurate  indication  of  changing  housing  prices  and  eliminates  potential  outliers  that  potentially  skew   results.  Figure  2  represents  the  Housing  Price  Index  in  Toronto  between  2000  and  2016,  this  index  is   created  by  Teranet  and  the  National  Bank  of  Canada  and  uses  repeat  sales  to  calculate  the  index1.  The   index  shows  that  prices  have  continuously  increased  since  2000,  with  a  slight  decline  between  2007  and   2008.  The  largest  changes  over  the  16-year  period  occurred  between  2010  and  2011,  about  a  10%   increase,  between  2014  and  2015,  about  a  10%  increase  and  finally  between  2015  and  2016,  about  20%   increase.  Over  the  course  of  the  16-year  period,  housing  prices  in  Toronto  have  increased  by  187%.

   Debt-to-income  (DTI)  refers  to  the  amount  of  debt  acquired  by  a  household  compared  to  the  overall   household  income.  This  measurement  is  preferred  over  loan-to-value  (LTV)  because  it  is  a  better   indication  of  whether  or  not  households  can  afford  their  home.  LTV  simply  measures  the  loan  amount   in  comparison  to  the  value  of  the  home,  whereas  DTI  ratio  measures  how  much  debt  a  household  has   compared  to  what  is  earned.    The  DTI  ratio  Canada  reached  a  historic  peak  of  167.6%  in  the  fourth   quarter  of  2016  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  This  poses  a  significant  risk  to   households  as  they  are  more  vulnerable  to  major  increases  in  interest  rates  and  unemployment.  The   DTI  ratio  is  a  significant  concern  to  the  sustainability  of  homeownership,  as  an  increase  in  interest  rates

and/or  unemployment  could  increase  the  risk  of  making  debt  payments  and  could  force  households  to   liquidate  assets  such  as  their  homes  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  Moreover,   resulting  in  a  decline  of  housing  prices  and  housing  market  activity  across  the  country  (Canada   Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  LTV  is  also  an  important  measure;  it  indicates  the  amount   of  debt  a  household  is  takes  against  the  value  of  the  home.  The  higher  the  LTV,  the  higher  a   households'  DTI  ratio.  This  means  that  regulations  need  to  be  implemented  in  order  to  ensure  the   stability  of  households  in  homeownership,  if  factors  such  as  interest  rates  and  unemployment   increased.      As  of  October  3,  2016  the  Canadian  Government  implemented  a  new  mortgage  regulation  to  ensure   that  borrows  taking  on  more  than  80%  loan-to-value  (LTV)  will  be  able  to  make  loan  payments  if   interest  rates  increase  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  This  regulation  was   implemented  to  increase  the  stability  of  the  housing  market  to  ensure  that  households  would  be  able  to   make  payments  and  remain  in  their  homes.  Mortgage  rates  are  expected  to  increase  modestly  over  the   next  few  years  and  this  new  regulation  includes  new  eligibility  rules  for  both  high  ratio  insured   mortgages  (loan-to-value  more  than  80%)  and  for  low  ratio  insured  mortgages  (loan-to-value  less  than   80%)  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  All  high  ratio  borrowers  will  have  to  meet  a   higher  standard  of  debt  servicing  to  ensure  that  payments  can  be  made  if  mortgage  rates  increase  after   the  5-year  term  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  This  new  regulation  is  expected  to   affect  about  5-10%  of  all  prospective  home  buyers  during  the  first  year  of  implementation  (Canada   Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  This  regulation  is  important  in  ensuring  the  stability  of   homeownership  as  well  as  ensuring  that  increased  DTI  ratios  will  not  be  detrimental  to  the  Canadian   housing  market.    

2.2.2.   Ontario  
   Every  province  in  Canada  has  unique  trends  within  the  housing  market.  Ontario  has  experienced  a   significant  increase  in  average  housing  prices  compared  to  Canada  as  a  whole  (Canada  Mortgage  and   Housing  Corporation,  2016).  Since  2014,  Ontario's  economy  has  outpaced  national  growth,  but  should   converge  closer  to  the  national  average  by  2018  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).   Figure  3  displays  the  actual  (2013-2015)  and  forecasted  (2016-2018)  Ontario  New  Home  Market.  This

2.  BACKGROUND  

New  Home  Market  is  indicative  of  a  shift  in  supply,  from  single-detached  homes  to  apartments2.  The   number  of  starts  are  expected  to  slow  between  2017  and  2018,  due  to  rising  debt  loads  in  Ontario.  Both   Ontario  and  British  Columbia  constitute  for  about  two  thirds  of  all  national  resales.  Ontario  and  British   Columbia's  housing  markets  are  dramatically  different  than  the  rest  of  Canada,  mainly  due  to  major   metropolitan  centres  and  more  economic  activity.

   Housing  between  southwestern  Ontario  and  the  GTA  is  a  lot  different  than  Northern  and  Eastern   Ontario.  Growth  in  southwestern  Ontario  and  the  GTA  continues  to  increase,  as  does  the  cost  of  living.   On  the  contrary,  Northern  and  Eastern  Ontario  face  economic  conditions  that  restrain  housing  activity.   Overall  Ontario  home  prices  will  continue  to  increase  but  at  a  slower  rate  by  2018  (Canada  Mortgage   and  Housing  Corporation,  2016).  Despite  the  increasing  house  prices  and  decreasing  starts  for  Ontario,   homeownership  rates  have  continued  increasing  since  1991.  Figure  4  shows  the  increase  in  ownership   in  Ontario  from  1991  to  2011  based  on  census  data.

2.3.  Affordability  Issue    
   The  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  is  facing  affordable  housing  issues.  Shift  in  supply  and  demand,   and  municipal  demographics  and  age  structure  have  all  contributed  to  this  issue.  The  Growth  Plan  for   the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  is  changing  the  course  of  housing  supply  as  the  policy  intends  to   intensify  already  built-up  areas  and  direct  growth  within  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe,  putting   pressure  on  the  supply  of  single-detached  houses.  Finding  affordable  housing  for  ownership  has  been   increasingly  difficult,  the  cost  of  purchasing  a  home  is  rising  and  the  rate  in  which  homes  are  selling  is   increasing  pressures  on  potential  home  buyers.  Households  are  spending  more  of  their  disposable   income  on  shelter  costs,  many  exceeding  30%  of  income  increasing  the  risk  of  households  falling  under   core  housing  need.  CMHC's  housing  standards  evaluate  three  factors  to  determine  whether  or  not  a   household  is  in  `Core  Housing  Need'.  A  household  is  defined  as  in  `Core  Housing  Need'  if  it,     Does  not  meet  one  or  more  of  the  adequacy,  suitability  or  affordability  standards  and  it  would   have  to  spend  30%  or  more  of  its  before-tax  income  to  access  local  housing  that  meets  all  three   standards  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).

2.  BACKGROUND  

12.5%  of  households  (1.6  million)  were  in  Core  Housing  Need  in  Canada  in  2011,  but  about  31%  of   Canadians  are  living  below  the  housing  standards  (Appendix  A:  Tables  for  Core  Housing  Need  -  table  3)   (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).        Demographic  and  social  trends  have  increased  the  percentage  of  one-person  and  lone-parent   households  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014),  which  has  an  affect  on  housing   affordability,  both  rental  and  ownership.  Household  incomes  are  influenced  by  type  of  education  and   employment,  shelter  costs  differ  by  geographic  location,  size  of  households  affect  how  suitable  certain   dwellings  are  for  households,  and  continuous  investment  in  home  repairs  and  renovations  can  reduce   the  number  of  households  that  live  in  inadequate  housing  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,   2014).  Increasing  affordable  homeownership  could  contribute  to  decreased  numbers  of  households  in   core  housing  need.  Households  that  are  homeowners  are  less  likely  to  fall  below  living  standards  than   renters;  in  Canada  in  2011,  7.2%  of  homeowners  compared  to  29.6%  of  renters  were  in  core  housing   need  (Appendix  A:  Tables  for  Core  Housing  Need  ­  table  3).  The  money  spent  on  shelter  for   homeowners  is  an  investment  and  contributes  to  increasing  the  net  wealth  of  the  household.    Economic   factors  including  low  interest  rates,  availability  of  relatively  cheap  credit,  strong  economic  growth,   increases  in  commodity  prices  have  contributed  to  rising  house  prices  in  places  like  Canada  (Cheung,   2014).  Many  households  that  traditionally  could  become  homeowners  are  remaining  as  renters  because   they  cannot  obtain  the  down  payments  required  to  purchase  a  home,  further  increasing  the  gap   between  renters  and  homeowners.  The  cost  of  owning  a  home  compared  to  renting  has  increased  well   above  the  long  term  average  (Cheung,  2014).        Housing  affordability  is  important  because  "housing  is  a  major  contributor  to  economic  growth,  social   stability  and  household  wealth  and  indebtedness"  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Housing  contributes  to   economic  growth  directly  through  the  construction  sector  and  indirectly  through  other  sectors  such  as   manufacturing,  finance,  real  estate  and  insurance,  and  forestry  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  For  every  $1   invested  in  housing,  the  local  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  increases  to  $1.40,  according  to  the   Federation  of  Canadian  Municipalities  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Additionally,  investment  in  housing   can  increase  employment  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Altus  Group  found  that  10,000  housing  starts   resulted  in  $1.8  billion  in  production  in  the  construction  sector  and  created  19,300  jobs  (City  of   Mississauga,  2016).  Affordable  housing  matters  because  it  has  social  impacts  that  are  "directly  linked  to   health,  education  and  household  wealth"  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Households  that  secure  housing

increase  the  likelihood  of  being  in  better  health,  perform  better  in  school,  and  have  more  personal   wealth  (Green  &  White,  1997;  City  of  Mississauga).  The  availability  of  affordable  housing  in  a   community  increases  the  capacity  of  businesses  to  sustain  a  stable  workforce  (City  of  Mississauga,   2016).  Affordable  housing  in  a  community  will  attract  households  in  all  stages  of  life,  contributing  to  a   diverse  and  vibrant  community  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Affordable  housing  is  also  important  in   reducing  homelessness.  The  lack  of  affordable  housing  can  lead  to  homelessness  as  more  households   are  at  risk  of  losing  their  homes  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Increasing  affordable  homeownership   contributes  to  local  economies,  increases  the  quality  of  life  in  families  and  individuals  as  well  as  results   in  savings  for  all  levels  of  government  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  According  to  the  City  of  Mississauga's   Affordable  Housing  Program  ­  Housing  Gap  Assessment  report,  "every  $10  spent  on  housing  and   supports  for  chornically  homeless  individuals  results  in  $21.72  in  savings  related  to  health  care,  social   supports,  housing  and  involvement  with  the  justice  system"  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  This  section   recognized  that  there  is  an  affordability  issue,  as  well  as  a  need  to  improve  affordablility.  It  also   acknowledged  the  importance  of  housing  affordability  to  local  economies  and  overall  quality  of  life  for   individials  and  families.

   This  paper  examines  Mississauga's  housing  affordability  issues,  specifically  pertaining  to   homeownership  and  provides  ways  to  reduce  the  increasing  unaffordability.  Mississauga  is  a  city   located  within  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  (GGHA)  and  is  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area  (GTA)   sharing  a  border  with  the  City  of  Toronto.  The  municipality  has  a  long  history  of  settlement,  housing   and  has  transformed  into  a  vibrant  urban  area.  This  section  examines  the  housing  trends  in   Mississauga,  including  tenure  and  future  growth  as  well  as  introduces  the  affordability  issues  that  the   city  currently  faces.    

3.1.  History  
   Mississauga  is  situated  on  Lake  Ontario,  with  the  City  of  Toronto  to  the  east  and  City  of  Oakville  to  the   West.  It  is  located  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area,  which  is  in  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  (Ministry   of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing,  2016).  This  location  is  a  prime  location  for  settlement  as  it  is  in  the   heart  of  the  Great  Lakes,  within  close  proximity  to  the  United  States  and  is  among  the  most  vibrant,   thriving  and  multicultural  economies  the  world  (Ministry  of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing,  2016).   Mississauga  is  the  6th  most  populous  cities  in  the  country  and  is  an  important  part  of  the  Ontario   economy.  Figure  5  shows  the  population  growth  in  the  City  between  1981  and  2016.  Since  the  1980's   the  City's  population  has  been  increasing;  however,  in  recent  years,  population  growth  has  slowed.   Between  2011  and  2016  the  population  increased  by  only  1.1%  (Statistics  Canada,  2016).  This  section   explores  the  history  of  the  municipality,  including  demographics  and  how  it  has  transformed  into  the   city  it  is  today.

   The  demographics  of  Mississauga  has  changed  dramatically  throughout  history,  in  the  1950s  over  80%   of  the  population  was  British  but  now  Mississauga  is  representative  of  a  multicultural  Canadian  city.  A   big  part  of  the  City's  growth  can  be  attributed  to  immigrant  populations.  In  2011,  immigrant   households  made  up  about  64%  of  all  households  in  Mississauga,  of  these  immigrant  households  about   76%  were  homeowners  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Figure  6  indicates  that  since  2001,  the  portion  of  the   population  comprised  of  immigrants  has  increased.  Recent  immigrants  refer  to  the  number  of   immigrants  that  arrived  within  the  previous  5  years,  in  2001,  recent  immigrants  refer  to  immigrants   arriving  between  1996  and  2001.  21%  of  the  immigrants  in  2001  were  recent  immigrants,  in  2006,  the   number  of  recent  immigrants  increased  by  about  24%  and  in  2011  this  number  decreased  by  about   20%.  Figure  7  represents  the  portion  of  recent  immigrants  in  relation  to  the  total  number  of  immigrants   in  Mississauga.  This  information  is  important  because  recent  immigrants  are  among  the  household   types  that  are  most  likely  to  face  housing  affordability  issues.  Mississauga's  growing  diversity  could   suggest  that  new  household  may  be  likely  to  face  housing  affordability  issues  in  the  coming  years.   Additionally,  in  2001,  visible  minorities  represented  about  40%  of  the  population,  by  2011,  visible      15  

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP

minorities  represented  about  54%  of  the  population.  Figure  8  represents  the  top  6  visible  minorities  in   Mississauga,  this  figure  just  gives  a  sense  of  how  Mississauga  is  transforming  into  a  vibrant  multicultural   city.

   The  following  sections  explore  elements  of  the  city  in  more  detail.  3.2  discusses  the  changes  in  tenure   throughout  the  City  and  3.3  examines  growth  in  Mississauga  in  recent  years  and  how  employment,   population  and  number  of  dwellings  have  contributed  to  the  ongoing  growth  of  this  vibrant  city.  3.4   discusses  where  the  city  is  headed  and  introduces  documents  that  may  guide  the  future  of  Mississauga.  

3.2.  Tenure  
   Similar  to  Ontario  and  the  rest  of  Canada,  Mississauga's  homeownership  rate  has  continued  to  increase   from  1981  and  began  plateauing  as  of  the  2011,  as  shown  in  figure  9.  However,  Mississauga's   homeownership  rates  in  2011,  were  higher  by  4  and  6  percentage  points  than  Ontario  and  Canada,   respectively.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  how  trends  of  homeownership  continue  as  house  prices   increase  faster  than  the  increase  of  household  income.  The  structural  type  of  dwelling  in  Mississauga  is   somewhat  representative  of  a  suburban  city  with  many  low-rise  dwellings,  however  there  are  areas  that   represent  a  more  urban  lifestyle.  The  two  dominant  types  of  dwellings  for  all  tenure  types  in  2011  were

detached  (39.1%)  and  apartment  (35.4%)  (City  of  Mississauga,  2013)3.  This  section  focuses  on  the  types   of  dwelling  structures,  the  age  and  the  tenure  of  residents  in  the  city.

Figure  9  Homeownership  Rate  Mississauga   Source:  Author's  calculations,  using  available  data  from  Statistics  Canada.  CHASS  1981  cumulative.

Census  subdivision,   Mississauga.  

  

   Homeownership  in  2011,  as  shown  in  figure  9  was  about  75%,  of  which  65.2%  reported  having  a   mortgage  or  loan  (City  of  Mississauga,  2014).  This  indicates  that  a  portion  of  the  homeownership   population  have  already  paid  off  their  homes.  The  median  monthly  shelter  costs  for  owners  was  about   $1,519  in  2011,  and  about  $1,062  for  renters  (City  of  Mississauga,  2014)4.  Although  the  shelter  costs  for   owners  were  slightly  higher  than  for  renters,  the  money  that  owners  use  to  pay  off  their  mortgages   increases  the  households'  net  wealth,  whereas  the  money  used  for  renters'  shelter  costs  goes  into  the   pockets  of  landlords.  Once  obtaining  ownership  status,  only  26.8%  of  owners  were  spending  more  than   30%  of  their  income  on  shelter  costs,  compared  to  42.5%  of  tenants.        In  Mississauga  in  2011,  the  number  of  children  aged  18-24  living  at  home  was  62,810  (an  increase  of   13.5%  from  2006)  and  children  aged  25+  living  at  home  was  42,545  (an  increase  of  22.9%  since  2006)   (City  of  Mississauga,  2012).  In  2011,  44.1%  of  couples  had  children  living  with  them  (City  of  Mississauga,                                                                                                                                           
3 4

  Dominant  types  of  dwelling  were  not  available  by  tenure  type.     These  costs  include  all  types  of  dwellings.

2012),  compared  to  42.8%  in  2001  (City  of  Mississauga,  2002).  It  is  interesting  to  note  the  slight   increase  in  children  living  at  home  is  paired  with  a  decline  in  children  under  6  and  6-14  years  old  living  in   households  (City  of  Mississauga,  2012).  Between  2006  and  2011,  there  was  a  percent  change  of  -0.5%   and  -4.5%  for  children  under  6  and  children  6-14  years  old,  respectively  (City  of  Mississauga,  2012).  This   indicates  that  although  the  number  of  children  living  in  households  is  increasing,  it  is  mainly  due  to   young  adults  (18+)  either  not  leaving,  or  coming  back  to  live  with  their  parents.  Delayed  behaviours  to   move  out  could  also  be  a  result  of  the  desire  to  own  rather  than  rent.  Children  are  remaining  at  home   until  this  can  be  achieved,  rather  than  renting  until  they  can  afford  to  own.    

3.3.  Future  Growth  
   Mississauga  is  in  a  unique  place  in  terms  of  its  future  compared  to  other  municipalities  in  the  Greater   Toronto  Area  (GTA)  and  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  (GGHA).  Most  of  the  City's  greenfield  lands   have  been  developed  and  the  future  will  focus  on  infilling  and  redevelopment  (City  of  Mississauga,   2015).  This  section  examines  the  population  and  the  shift  in  types  of  dwellings  in  Mississauga,  as  well  as   the  role  of  employment  in  this  area.  The  lack  of  available  greenfields  will  have  an  affect  on  the  future  of   the  municipality  and  will  guide  the  direction  and  the  growth  over  the  next  30  years.  This  impacts  the   ability  of  single-detached  dwellings  to  be  constructed,  which  could  have  an  impact  on  the  cost  of   existing  single-detached  homes.        Traditionally,  population  and  employment  growth  has  been  directed  by  a  municipality's  capacities  to   accommodate  new  housing  on  greenfields  (City  of  Mississauga,  2013).  The  majority  of  Mississauga's   greenfield  have  already  been  built  out  and  the  future  of  population  and  employment  growth  will  be   based  on  intensification  and  redevelopment  of  already  built  up  areas  (City  of  Mississauga,  2013).  High   density  residential  developments  will  be  centred  in  the  city's  downtown  and  major  node  character   areas,  while  more  medium-density  housing  will  be  the  focus  of  redevelopment  in  neighbourhoods  (City   of  Mississauga,  2013).  Growth  will  also  be  dependent  on  demand,  given  that  most  greenfields  are   almost  built  out,  the  supply  of  single-detached  homes  will  begin  decreasing,  and  may  contribute  to   increased  demand  for  single-detached  homes  and  increase  unaffordability  of  this  housing  type.  Based   on  the  availability  of  land,  and  policies  for  intensification  and  redevelopment,  table  1  represents  the   existing  and  future  housing  unit  potential  for  the  City  of  Mississauga  (City  of  Mississauga,  2013).  Supply   of  single-detached  and  semi-detached  will  decline,  while  row  and  apartment  dwelling  types  will   increase  as  development  occurs  through  infill  and  redevelopment  (City  of  Mississauga,  2013).  The

percentage  change  shows  the  potential  increases  in  housing  stock  by  type  of  dwelling,  indicating  that   there  is  not  much  room  for  the  supply  of  single-detached  to  increase,  and  there  is  a  higher  potential  for   row  (townhouses)  and  apartment  supply.

  According  to  Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board  annual  sales  for  single-detached  home  for  2016  were  7.9%   lower  than  2015  levels,  while  the  price  ranges  for  single-detached  homes  have  increased  (Mississauga   Real  Estate  Board,  n.d.).  Table  2  represents  the  change  in  sales  by  category  from  2015-2016  along  with   the  year-over-year  percentage  change  for  sales  by  price  (Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board,  n.d.).  The   median  number  of  days  on  the  market  for  single-detached  homes  was  between  1-10  for  all  price  ranges   (Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board,  n.d.).  Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board  would  describe  the  single- detached  market  as  "an  unprecedented  level  of  demand  relative  to  available  supply"  (Mississauga  Real   Estate  Board,  n.d.).  Additionally,  supply  for  single-detached  homes  in  the  lower  price  ranges  has  dried   up,  resulting  in  minimal  sales  activity  despite  continuous  demand  (Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board,  n.d.).   Similarly,  supply  for  price  ranges  below  $500K  of  semi-detached  homes  has  also  dried  up,  although   demand  remains  high  (Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board,  n.d.).  The  highest  price  range  for  semi-detached   homes  spent  the  least  amount  of  time  on  the  market  before  selling  (Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board,   n.d.).  Townhouses  displayed  strong  demand  in  the  $500K-$600K  range  as  households  may  be  opting   for  purchasing  townhouses  over  single-detached  homes  (Mississauga  Real  Estate  Board,  n.d.).   Condominiums  may  be  the  most  affordable  option  for  homeowners.  This  type  of  swelling  also  shows  a   lack  of  supply  where  demand  is  high,  in  the  $150K  range.

3.4.    Housing  Affordability  in  Mississauga  
   Section  2.3  explored  the  affordability  issues,  the  need  to  increase  affordable  homeownership  and  the   importance  of  it.  This  section  looks  at  housing  affordability  issues  as  it  relates  to  the  City  of   Mississauga.  Population,  household  type  and  type  of  dwellings  available,  all  have  an  impact  on  housing   demand  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  In  Mississauga  the  overall  demand  of  housing  is  expected  to   increase  by  20%  by  2036  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The  population  increased  by  6.7%  between  2006   and  2011  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016)  and  although  the  population  only  increased  1.1%  between  2011   and  2016  (Statistics  Canada,  2016),  it  is  expected  to  increase  another  14.9%  by  2036  from  2011  (City  of      22

Mississauga,  2016).  By  2036,  the  number  of  households  is  expected  to  reach  280,800  which  is  about  a   19.7%  growth  since  2011  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The  age  structure  in  Mississauga  is  also  changing   and  the  number  of  seniors  is  increasing.  Older  adults  (55+)  accounted  for  only  14%  of  the  population  in   1991,  however  by  2011  this  increased  to  23%  of  the  total  population  in  Mississauga  (City  of  Mississauga,   2016).  Seniors  65+  increased  by  24%,  reaching  11.4%  of  the  total  population  in  Mississauga.  The  aging   population  is  indicative  of  a  need  to  alter  dwelling  types  to  accommodate  for  the  changing   demographics  and  provide  housing  that  is  suitable  for  all  populations  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).        The  types  of  dwellings  that  should  be  built  in  Mississauga  is  tricky,  there  is  a  growing  need  for  smaller   units  to  accommodate  households  made  of  of  one-  and  two-persons  but  there  is  also  a  growing  need   for  larger  units  as  four-  and  five-person  households  are  also  increasing  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The   number  of  larger  households  in  Mississauga  is  unlike  many  Ontario  communities,  in  2011  four-person   households  made  up  21.7%  of  the  population,  while  5  or  more-person  households  made  up  15.7%  (City   of  Mississauga,  2016).  Additionally,  Mississauga's  population  in  becoming  increasingly  diverse.  In  2011,   1  in  every  12  Mississauga  residents  is  a  recent  immigrant,  immigrant  households  made  up  63.8%  of  all   households  in  Mississauga,  and  75.8%  of  these  were  homeowners  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  In  2011,   10.8%  of  households  have  a  member  with  a  disability  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The  diversity  of  the   population  in  terms  of  age,  background,  and  structure  all  indicate  a  need  to  have  a  wide  range  of   housing  types  for  all  residents  including  housing  that  is  accessible  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).      The  income  gap  in  Mississauga  has  increased,  further  polarizing  the  poorest  and  the  richest  households   in  the  city.  In  2010,  the  average  household  income  was  $95,052,  up  7.4%  from  2005,  which  was  $88,512   (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The  lowest  10%  of  households  and  the  highest  10%  share  an  astonishing   gap,  earning  an  average  of  $21,589  and  $177,369,  respectively  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Housing   affordability  issues  refer  to  households  that  spend  30%  or  more  of  their  income  on  housing  costs,  deep   housing  affordability  issues  refer  to  households  spending  50%  or  more  of  their  income  on  housing  costs   and  finally  severe  affordability  issues  refer  to  households  spending  70%  or  more  of  their  income  on   housing  costs  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Figure  10  indicates  the  proportion  of  households  that  fall   under  each  of  the  housing  affordability  issues  in  Mississauga  in  2011.  It  is  evident  that  there  are   significant  housing  affordability  issues  in  Mississauga  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Both  renters  and   owners  experience  these  issues,  however,  a  significantly  larger  portion  of  renters  face  affordability   issues  than  owners.  26.8%  of  all  owner  households  were  spending  30%  or  more  of  their  income  in  2011,

while  11.4%  were  spending  50%  or  more  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  42.5%  of  all  renters  experienced   housing  affordability  issues  spending  30%  or  more,  while  20.4%  of  renters  were  spending  50%  or  more   (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  As  mentioned  in  section  3.2  Tenure,  the  average  cost  of  living  between   owners  and  renters  is  not  dramatically  different,  however  the  benefits  that  ownership  households  gain   may  outweigh  the  additional  costs  of  owning.  For  instance,  the  money  that  is  being  spent  on  shelter  is  a   direct  investment  into  the  household,  rather  than  renting  where  the  money  is  not  going  back  to  the   household.

   This  City  of  Mississauga's  Affordable  Housing  Program  ­  Housing  Gap  Assessment  (2016)  indicates  that   certain  household  types  may  be  more  susceptible  to  housing  affordability  issues.  Figures  11  and  12   indicate  the  percentage  of  households  that  have  housing  affordability  issues  and  deep  housing   affordability  issues  based  on  household  type5.  Additionally,  the  majority  of  households  in  core  housing   need  fell  below  the  affordability  standard  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  91.6%  of  households  in  core  need   lived  in  homes  that  were  not  affordable  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  15.3%  of  all  households  in  2011   were  in  core  housing  need.  This  data  is  a  clear  indication  that  there  is  an  affordability  issue  in   Mississauga  that  needs  to  be  addressed.  Creating  dwelling  types  suitable  for  the  changing  population  is   an  essential  part  in  ensuring  housing  is  suitable  for  each  household  type  as  well  as  ensuring  they  are   affordable  for  households  to  have  housing  stability.

   Households  in  Mississauga  now,  are  living  in  more  high-density  structures  than  they  were  in  the  past.   While  the  most  dominant  type  of  dwelling  is  still  single-detached  dwellings,  apartment  units  are  slowly   increasing  to  catch  up  with  the  single-detached  supply  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016)6.  Additionally,  the   number  of  single-detached  starts  will  decline  due  to  lack  of  available  space,  but  apartment  starts  will   continue  to  increase.  Figure  13  represents  the  distribution  of  the  supply  of  dwellings  by  type  in   Mississauga  in  20117.  The  average  price  of  houses  in  Mississauga  has  increased,  from  $421,096  to   $546,720  between  2011  and  2015  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016)8.  In  Mississauga,  "the  demand  for   affordable  ownership  dwellings  does  not  match  the  supply"  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  52.3%  of  all   owners  have  incomes  ranging  from  $25,458  to  $99,875  (Decile  1  to  6),  while  only  27.8%  of  the   ownership  housing  is  actually  affordable  to  these  households.  Figure  14  and  15  show  the  affordability  of   ownership  housing  and  rental  housing  in  Mississauga.  As  house  prices  have  increased,  ownership  is   becoming  increasingly  unattainable  for  low  and  moderate  income  earners  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).

Although  this  paper  is  primarily  focused  on  ownership  affordability,  it  is  important  to  note  that  market   rents  are  still  unaffordable  to  about  30%  of  renters  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).

   More  than  40%  of  Mississauga  ownership  households  are  unable  to  afford  owning  a  home  unless  they   spent  30%  or  more  of  their  income  on  housing  costs  or  make  a  down  payment  greater  than  5%  of  the   purchase  price  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The  idea  of  owning  a  single-detached  home  will  remain  an   idea  or  a  dream  for  the  majority  of  residents  in  Mississauga.  Even  ownership  households  in  Decile  9   would  have  to  spend  30%  or  more  of  their  income  in  order  to  affordably  own  an  averagely  priced  single- detached  home.

   The  rental  affordability,  figure  15,  indicates  that  rental  households  in  the  4th  Decile  would  not  be  able  to   afford  rent  for  a  one-bedroom  unit,  and  households  in  the  5th  Decile  would  not  be  able  to  afford  3+   bedrooms  without  spending  30%  or  more  of  their  income  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).        Figure  16,  represents  the  affordability  thresholds  for  both  rental  and  ownership  in  Mississauga,  based   on  income  Deciles  created  by  the  Region  of  Peel  and  applied  to  households  in  the  City  of  Mississauga   (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Affordability  was  defined  by  households  spending  30%  of  their  income  on   shelter  costs  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  These  figures  indicate  the  house  types  that  are  affordable   options  to  households  in  Mississauga  based  on  income.  Households  that  are  considered  low  income  are   in  Deciles  1-3  with  incomes  up  to  $55,493,  moderate  income  households  are  between  the  4th  and  6th   Deciles  with  incomes  between  $55,494  and  $99,875  and  high  income  households  are  in  Decile  7  to  10   and  have  incomes  over  $99,875  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  It  is  evident  that  there  are  limited  options   for  low  income  households  in  Mississauga,  this  category  is  comprised  of  31.8%  of  all  households  in  the   city,  54%  of  low  income  households  are  owners,  while  46%  are  renters  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).   69.2%  of  all  households  in  this  category  have  housing  affordability  issues,  40.2%  have  deep  housing   affordability  issues  and  25.3%  have  severe  housing  affordability  issues  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The      29  

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP

most  vulnerable  household  types  within  the  low  income  households  category  include  couples  with   children,  multiple  family  households,  recent  immigrant  households,  lone  parents,  and  non-family   households  with  two  or  more  people  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Moderate  income  households  have  a   slightly  larger  range  of  options  for  affordable  housing,  but  26.1%  are  still  experiencing  affordability   issues  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  This  category  is  comprised  of  28.8%  of  all  Mississauga  households,   2.6%  of  these  households  are  spending  more  than  50%  and  have  deep  housing  affordability  issues  and   only  0.4%  of  these  households  have  severe  housing  affordability  issues  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The   most  vulnerable  household  types  in  this  category  include  couples  with  children  and  multiple  family   households  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Finally,  the  last  category  are  the  high  income  households,   which  have  the  largest  range  of  housing  choices  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  39.4%  of  all  households  in   Mississauga  fall  within  the  7th  and  10th  Deciles.  Only  2.6%  of  these  households  spend  more  than  30%  of   their  income,  and  145  households  are  spending  more  than  50%,  however  it  should  be  noted  that   households  in  this  income  range  may  be  choosing  to  spend  this  much  on  housing  as  there  are  more   affordable  options  available  to  them  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  Figure  16  shows  that  there  are  more   households  between  Decile  1  and  6  than  there  are  available  ownership  units,  which  increase  the   chances  of  unaffordability  among  these  income  groups.  Demand  exceeds  supply,  31.8%  to  17.9%   between  Decile  1  and  3,  and  28.8%  to  27.2%  between  Decile  4  and  6  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  On  the   contrary,  supply  exceeds  demand  between  Deciles  7  and  10,  with  54.9%  supply  and  39.4%  demand   (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).

4.   POLICIES  AND  PLANS  
   This  section  identifies  provincial,  regional  and  municipal  policies  that  would  have  an  effect  on   development  and  growth  and  has  potential  to  affect  the  housing  affordability  in  Mississauga.  It   examines  policies  and  documents  that  have  direct  and  indirect  consequences  on  housing  affordability   in  Mississauga.  Provincial  policies  guide  local  planning  decisions  and  municipal  policies  must  comply   with  and  sometimes  conform  to  provincial  policies.    

4.1.  Provincial   4.1.1.   Planning  Act,  1990  
   The  planning  act  is  a  piece  of  legislation  intended  to  guide  development  and  growth  within  the  province   of  Ontario.  It  outlines  that  municipal  governments  have  authority  over  certain  planning  decisions  as   long  as  they  conform  to  the  guidelines  outlined  in  the  Planning  Act.  Each  planning  decision  must  also   have  the  provincial  interest  in  mind.  The  Planning  Act  outlines  how  municipalities  can  administer  their   own  guidelines  and  policies  of  growth  and  development  based  on  local  needs  and  wants  (Province  of   Ontario,  2016).        The  Planning  Act  is  important  to  shaping  the  future  of  affordable  housing,  particularly  affordable   homeownership.  The  purpose  of  this  Act  is  to  guide  the  other  provincial,  regional  and  municipal  policies   that  have  an  impact  on  the  shape  and  structure  of  future  growth.  The  Planning  Act  guides  regional  and   municipal  official  plans  that  play  a  role  in  how  the  supply  of  all  types  of  housing  tenure  is  distributed   within  these  areas.      

4.1.2.   Provincial  Policy  Statement,  2014  
   The  Provincial  Policy  Statement  (PPS)  is  under  section  3  of  the  Planning  Act,  in  which  the  Minister  alone   or  with  any  other  minister  of  the  Crown  may  pass  a  policy  statement  relating  to  municipal  planning   matters  that  are  of  provincial  interest  (Province  of  Ontario,  2014).  The  Provincial  Policy  Statement  has   three  overarching  policies  which  include,  building  strong  healthy  communities,  wise  use  and   management  of  resources  and  protecting  public  health  and  safety  (Province  of  Ontario,  2014).

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  

  

4.  POLICIES  AND  PLANS  

Section  1.4  of  the  PPS  addresses  housing.  It  states  that  municipalities  must  provide  an  appropriate   range  and  mix  of  housing  types  and  densities  to  accommodate  for  current  and  future  residents.   Planning  authorities  must  ensure  that  they  establish  and  implement  minimum  targets  for  the  provision   of  housing  which  is  affordable  to  low  and  moderate  income  households.  (Province  of  Ontario,  2014)      In  order  to  ensure  that  there  is  an  available  range  of  housing,  municipalities  need  to  be  aware  of  the   affordable  homeownership  issues  and  use  the  PPS  to  help  guide  their  local  policies.  These  local  policies   can  directly  impact  on  the  availability  of  affordable  housing,  particularly  homeownership.  

4.1.3.   Proposed  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe,  2016  
   In  2016,  the  Province  released  a  Proposed  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  that  better   reflects  intensification  and  growth  targets  for  municipalities  in  the  GGHA  than  the  2006  version.  This   section  focuses  on  the  targets  set  out  by  the  Proposed  Growth  Plan.  The  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater   Golden  Horseshoe,  2006  (Growth  Plan)  was  the  first  document  that  provided  a  framework  for   implementing  the  province's  idea  for  building  stronger,  prosperous  communities  by  improving  the   management  of  growth  for  the  region.  In  addition  to  that,  it  provides  guidance  for  improving  the  ways   our  cities,  towns  and  suburbs  grow  over  time.      The  Growth  Plan  is  intended  to  direct  and  guide  the  growth  and  future  development  of  municipalities   within  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  in  order  to  accomplish  their  visions.  Some  aspects  of  this  vision   include  sustainable  infrastructure,  residents  have  easy  access  to  shelter,  food,  education  and  health- care  facilities,  public  services  are  located  in  community  hubs,  there  is  an  integrated  transportation   network  to  allow  residents  to  get  around  easily,  and  public  transportation  be  affordable  and  efficient   (Ministry  of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing,  2016).  The  GGHA  should  resemble  a  healthy  natural   environment  with  clean  air,  land  and  water,  it  should  allow  for  residents  to  access  natural   environments,  while  protecting  the  environmentally  sensitive  areas  that  surround  the  region  (Ministry   of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing,  2016).      Growth  will  be  focused  on  Urban  Growth  Centres  and  transit  corridors  and  station  areas,  which  will  be   defined  in  Official  Plans.  The  section  2.2.6  Housing  (Appendix  B:  Policy)  identifies  the  need  for   municipalities  to  have  a  housing  strategy  to  mitigate  issues  that  are  present  within  their  jurisdiction  and   to  ensure  that  all  residents  have  equal  access  to  shelter  (Ministry  of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing,

4.  POLICIES  AND  PLANS  

2016).  It  is  particularly  important  that  municipalities  recognize  the  housing  issues  related  to  affordable   homeownership.  Homeownership  plays  a  significant  role  in  local  economies  and  adding  societal   benefits.  By  focusing  on  these  issues,  municipalities  will  be  able  to  adhere  to  The  Growth  Plan's  vision.  

4.1.4.   Inclusionary  Zoning  
   Inclusionary  Zoning  is  a  concept  that  has  been  adopted  in  many  municipalities  in  England  and  the  United   States.   It   would   allow   municipal   authorities   to   require   affordable   units   as   part   of   residential   developments.  Bill  7,  the  Promoting  Affordable  Housing  Act,  2016  was  given  Royal  Assent  on  December   8,  2016.  This  means  that  the  Bill  was  passed  and  gives  municipalities  the  option  of  requiring  inclusionary   zoning.      Implementing  inclusionary  zoning  would  help  to  achieve  the  following:   -   -   -   Serving  more  people:  it  would  increase  the  supply  of  affordable  housing  that  serves  the  needs   of  low-to  moderate  income  households   It  would  help  to  create  inclusive  and  integrate  communities   It  would  meet  local  needs:  it  can  help  municipalities  meet  their  housing  targets  and  goals  in   their  homelessness  plans  and  official  plans   (Ministry  of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing,  2017).      The  passing  and  adoption  of  Bill  7,  Promoting  Affordable  Housing  Act,  2016  will  impact  the  following   policies  and  plans:   -   -   -   -   -   -      Inclusionary  zoning  is  an  important  aspect  when  tackling  affordable  homeownership.  It  allows   municipalities  to  have  the  power  to  require  affordable  units  in  new  builds.  It  also  encourages  a  mix  of   demographics  rather  than  a  complete  segregation  of  rich  and  poor  based  on  dwelling  type.  It  creates   diversity  within  buildings  and  neighbourhoods.

4.2.  Regional   4.2.1.   Region  of  Peel  Official  Plan  
   The  purpose  of  this  plan  is  to  provide  an  overarching  framework  for  development  and  growth  in  the   Region  of  Peel;  integrating  environmental,  social,  economic  and  cultural  imperatives  as  well  as   encouraging  sustainable  development  (Region  of  Peel,  2016).  This  regional  plan  overlooks  the   municipalities  in  Peel,  which  include  Caledon,  Brampton  and  Mississauga.        The  Region  of  Peel  Official  Plan  addresses  provisions  of  housing  to  meet  needs  in  order  to  provide  a   higher  quality  of  life  for  Peel  residents.  The  general  objectives  of  the  housing  section  of  this  plan  are  to   provide  an  appropriate  mix  and  range  of  housing  types,  to  foster  availability  of  housing  for  all  income   groups,  to  foster  efficient  and  environmentally  sensitive  use  of  land,  and  to  achieve  annual  minimum   new  housing  unit  targets,  including  affordable  housing  (Region  of  Peel,  2016).  The  policies  that  adhere   to  these  objectives  can  be  found  in  Appendix  B:  Policy.      Section  5.8.3  of  the  official  plan  addresses  Supply  of  Affordable  Housing,  which  indicates  a  need  to   increase  the  supply  of  affordable  rental  and  affordable  ownership  housing  within  the  region.  The   policies  that  address  this  objective  can  be  found  in  Appendix  B:  Policy.  Other  sections  of  housing  in  the   Region's  Official  Plan  include  retention  of  existing  rental  housing  stock,  energy  efficient  housing,   housing  options  for  persons  with  special  needs  and  diverse  populations,  and  addressing  the  barriers  to   access  housing  (Region  of  Peel,  2016).       

4.3.  Municipal   4.3.1.   City  of  Mississauga  Official  Plan  
   The  City  of  Mississauga  Official  Plan  provides  a  framework  to  protect,  enhance,  restore  and  expand  the   Natural  Heritage  System,  to  direct  growth  to  enhance  the  existing  urban  form,  support  a  strong  public   transportation  system  and  address  issues  pertaining  to  long  term  sustainability  of  the  city  (City  of   Mississauga,  2015).  The  plan  discusses  directing  growth  and  that  housing  and  job  growth  will  be   balanced  and  phased  to  ensure  that  services  and  amenities  remain  on  pace  with  development  (City  of   Mississauga,  2015).  The  Plan  ensures  that  it  adheres  to  and  is  consistent  with  other  policies,  such  as  the   PPS,  The  Growth  Plan  and  Region  of  Peel  Official  Plan.      35

4.  POLICIES  AND  PLANS  

Mississauga  is  made  up  of  various  land  uses  and  designated  specific  character  areas.  Major  Nodes   provide  the  city  with  higher  density  housing  through  different  phases  for  a  variety  of  income  groups   (City  of  Mississauga,  2015).  Community  Nodes  provide  residents  with  access  to  everything  needed  for   daily  living;  these  areas  are  expected  to  have  a  diverse  housing  stock  that  meet  the  housing  needs  of   the  populations  adjacent  to  these  nodes  (City  of  Mississauga,  2015).  Some  of  the  City's  neighbourhoods   are  historic,  but  the  majority  of  them  were  built  in  the  late  20th  Century  and  the  housing  stock  in  these   areas  are  relatively  new  and  in  a  good  state  of  repair  (City  of  Mississauga,  2015).        The  Official  Plan  guides  where  and  what  type  of  housing  are  being  permitted  in  certain  character  areas.   Neighbourhoods  are  only  be  permitted  to  accommodate  for  low  and  mid-density  dwellings,  not   exceeding  4  storeys  (City  of  Mississauga,  2015).  The  Official  Plan's  Complete  Communities  section  has   policies  regarding  meeting  the  needs  of  people  of  all  ages,  abilities  and  income  groups.  As  well  as   having  provision  to  ensure  suitable  housing  so  that  youth,  older  adults  and  immigrant  can  thrive  within   these  communities  (City  of  Mississauga,  2015).  Section  7.2  describes  the  policies  under  the  Official  Plan   Complete  Communities  that  pertain  specifically  to  housing  and  under  section  7.2.2,  the  City  plans  to   provide  opportunities  for  developing  a  range  of  housing  types,  variety  of  affordable  dwelling  types,   both  rental  and  ownership  and  producing  houses  for  those  with  special  needs,  such  as  the  elderly   (Appendix  B:  Policy)  (City  of  Mississauga,  2015).

5.   EXISTING  PROGRAMS  
   This  section  outlines  programs  that  currently  exist  to  help  alleviate  the  housing  affordability  issue.   These  programs  target  both  rental  and  ownership  affordability.    

5.1.  Federal/Provincial   5.1.1.   Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation  ­  Affordable  Housing  Programs   in  Ontario  
   The  Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation  has  many  programs  to  help  Ontario  residents  achieve   affordable  housing  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Coporation,  2017).  Programs  aim  to  increase  the   supply  of  affordable  housing,  to  improve  housing  affordability,  to  renovate  and  repair  housing  and  to   foster  safe  independent  living  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Coporation,  2017).  These  programs   target  both  renters  and  homeownership,  as  well  as  population  groups  that  are  more  vulnerable  to   unaffordable  housing.      Two  programs  in  particular  pertain  specifically  to  affordable  homeownership.  The  first  program  is   called  Ontario  Renovates,  some  of  the  objectives  of  this  program  are  to  improve  living  conditions   through  financial  assistance,  to  foster  independent  living  for  seniors  and  persons  with  disabilities   through  home  improvements  to  be  more  accessible  and  accommodating,  and  to  increase  supply  of   affordable  rentals  by  assisting  to  create  secondary  suites  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,   2014).  CMHC  provides  forgivable  loans  to  ensure  that  homes  remain  suitable  for  households.  This   program  targets  homeowners  as  well  as  landlords  to  improve  rental  units.  There  are  restrictions  that   apply  for  the  loan  to  be  forgivable  and  other  conditions  associated  with  funding.  For  home  repairs  75%   of  the  estimated  project  costs  are  given  within  15  business  days  of  the  project  approval,  the  remaining   25%  is  awarded  once  repairs  are  complete  and  projects  costs  are  finalized  (Canada  Mortgage  and   Housing  Corporation,  2014).  For  landlords  or  renovations  in  multi-unit  buildings,  50%  of  funding  is   awarded  when  the  funding  agreement  is  signed,  another  40%  granted  when  50%  of  the  work  is   completed  and  the  remaining  10%  is  granted  after  the  completion  of  renovations  and  submission  of   post-repair  occupancy  report  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).  This  program  has  a   maximum  funding  capacity  of  $50,000/unit  and  service  manager's  area  cannot  exceed  an  average  of   $25,000/unit  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).           37

5.  EXISTING  PROGRAMS  

The  second  program  is  called  the  Home  Ownership  Program,  the  objective  of  this  program  is  to  assist   with  down  payments  when  purchasing  a  home  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).  It  is   a  forgivable  loan  and  provides  renters  an  opportunity  to  move  into  homeownership  (Canada  Mortgage   and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).  It  also  eases  rental  demand  and  encourages  developers  to  build   affordable  housing  by  fostering  ownership  demand  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).   This  program  is  targeted  towards  both  owners  and  renters  looking  to  purchase  a  primary  residence  and   are  below  the  60th  percentile  income  level  for  the  area  they  are  purchasing  in  (Canada  Mortgage  and   Housing  Corporation,  2014).  Similar  to  Ontario  Renovates,  this  program  also  provides  a  forgivable  loan   (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).  However,  this  loan  is  only  forgivable  after  a  20- year  period  and  abiding  to  all  associated  conditions.  This  program  has  a  maximum  funding  capacity  of   $50,000  /unit  and  total  funding  must  not  exceed  10%  of  the  purchase  price  (Canada  Mortgage  and   Housing  Corporation,  2014).  In  addition  to  providing  down  payment  assistance,  this  program  also   provides  education  for  potential  homeowners  to  learn  about  the  up-front  and  on-going  costs  of  being  a   homeowner  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).      These  programs  are  funded  by  the  Investment  in  Affordable  Housing  for  Ontario  Program  (IAH),  which   provides  and  will  continue  providing  over  $800  million  in  federal  and  provincial  funding  to  improve   access  to  housing  between  2014  and  2020  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2014).   Households  that  face  deep  and  severe  housing  affordability  and  households  that  want  to  move  into   ownership  can  take  advantage  of  some  of  the  programs  that  help  with  the  burden  of  affording  a  home.   These  two  programs  in  particular,  provide  a  starting  point  for  many  renters  and  owners  to  remain  in   suitable  housing  conditions  and/or  move  into  homeownership  affordably.    

5.1.2.   Ontario's  Long-Term  Affordable  Housing  Strategy  Update  
   The  Province  released  a  Long-Term  Affordable  Housing  Strategy  in  2010,  and  building  on  the  2016   Ontario  Budget  the  updated  version  of  the  Plan  was  released  in  March  2016.  The  Province  is  committed   to  new  operating  and  capital  funding  to  support  this  plans  initiatives  (Province  of  Ontario,  2016).  This   plan  sets  out  to  guide  Ontario  municipalities  in  tackling  homelessness  and  affordable  housing  issues.      The  updated  version  of  the  plan  included  some  key  themes  that  arose  during  the  consultation  process.   The  updated  version  addresses  these  common  themes:   -   Supply  of  affordable  housing  need  to  be  increased  (both  for  rental  and  ownership)

(Province  of  Ontario,  2016).      This  plan  is  intended  to  guide  local  initiatives  and  plans  in  providing  housing  that  is  accessible  to  all   residents  of  Ontario.  The  overarching  vision  for  this  plan  is  to  support  social  and  economic  inclusion,   end  chronic  homelessness  and  meet  all  housing  need  for  all  Ontarians.  The  two  main  objectives   outlined  in  this  plan  are  to  decrease  the  number  of  people  who  are  homeless  and  increase  the  number   of  families  and  individuals  achieving  housing  stability.    This  plan  targets  owners,  renters  and  the   homeless  and  is  provincially  funded.  The  funding  for  this  program  is  increasing,    growing  from  $2.5   million  in  2016/17  to  $10  million  in  2018/19  (Province  of  Ontario,  2016).  Additionally,  the  changes  to  the   Building  Code  allows  wood-frame  structures  to  be  built  up  to  6  storeys  now,  rather  than  4  (Province  of   Ontario,  2016).  This  reduces  construction  costs  of  building  mid-rise  developments  and  could  make   housing  more  affordable  (Province  of  Ontario,  2016).      Since  Ontario's  Long-Term  Affordable  Housing  Strategy  launched  in  2010,  there  have  been  a  number   of  successes  that  have  contributed  to  affordable  homeownership,  both  directly  and  indirectly.  In  2012,   Services  Managers  created  housing  strategies  to  tackle  both  homelessness  and  affordable  housing,   including  both  rental  and  ownership  (Province  of  Ontario,  2016).  In  2014,  the  Minister's  forum  on   affordable  housing  and  the  private  sector  addressed  the  need  to  work  with  the  private  sector  to   facilitate  the  construction  of  both  affordable  homeownership  and  rental  housing  (Province  of  Ontario,   2016).  After  the  PanAm  Games  in  2015,  it  was  announced  that  the  Athlete's  Village  would  convert  into   numerous  affordable  ownership  units  and  affordable  rental  units  (Province  of  Ontario,  2016).  Since   2011,  Investment  in  Affordable  Housing  for  Ontario  (IAH)  has  assisted  almost  15,000  households   (Province  of  Ontario,  2016).

This  Plan  is  a  guiding  framework  for  Mississauga  when  planning  for  the  future.  The  City's  own  housing   strategy  will  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  all  of  the  initiatives  offered  by  the  Plan.  The  objectives   identified  in  this  plan  are  similar  to  the  priorities  for  Mississauga,  due  to  its  size  and  growing   unaffordability,  this  plan  plays  a  key  role  in  shaping  affordability  strategies.  Specifically,  in  areas  where   policy  only  permits  mid-rise  developments,  wood  framed  structures  will  reduce  costs  to  allow  for  more   cost  effective  and  hopefully  affordable  units.    

5.2.  Regional   5.2.1.   Peel's  Housing  and  Homelessness  Plan  2014-2024  
   As  required  by  the  Province  of  Ontario's  Long-Term  Affordable  Housing  Strategy,  The  Region  of  Peel   developed  a  local  homelessness  and  housing  plan  (Region  of  Peel,  2014).  This  plan  is  centred  around   putting  people  first  and  ensuring  stable  housing  solutions  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  achieve   social  and  economic  outcomes  for  all  families  and  individuals  (Region  of  Peel,  2014).      This  Plan  has  three  main  objectives  including,  ensuring  available  and  accessible  quality  housing  that   meets  people's  needs  and  preferences  throughout  their  lives,  building  individual  and  family  capacity,   and  creating  an  environment  that  helps  people  secure  and  maintain  housing  at  every  stage  of  life  and   finally,  implementing  an  integrated  system  that  supports  people's  housing  needs  efficiently  and   effectively  (Region  of  Peel,  2014).      Although  this  Plan  focuses  on  eradicating  homelessness,  it  also  provides  actions  and  strategies  to   improve  housing  standards  and  ensure  housing  stability  for  all  residents  (Region  of  Peel,  2014).  The   Plan  has  strategic  actions  to  increase  the  supply  of  housing  options,  encourage  innovative  and  cost- effective  housing  solutions  and  other  strategies  to  improve  housing  conditions.  It  is  an  important   framework  to  guide  the  future  of  housing  within  the  Region.  Mississauga  is  the  largest  municipality  in   Peel  Region  and  this  Plan  will  greatly  affect  the  future  outlook  of  affordable  housing,  particularly   affordable  ownership  within  the  City.

5.  EXISTING  PROGRAMS  

The  City  of  Mississauga  is  currently  procuring  an  Affordable  Housing  Program  that  intends  to  improve   access  to  affordable  housing  (City  of  Mississauga,  n.d.).  It  will  focus  on  both  affordable  rental  and   ownership  and  respond  to  the  City's  affordable  housing  needs.  The  program  will  work  in  partnership   with  all  levels  of  government,  as  well  as  the  private  and  not-profit  sectors  to  increase  affordable   housing  options  for  all  residents.        As  indicated  in  section  3.4  Housing  Affordability  in  Mississauga,  there  needs  to  be  a  wider  range  of   affordable  options  for  particular  types  of  households  as  well  as  for  low  and  moderate  income   households.  The  City  conducted  a  study  in  October  2016  on  understanding  the  cost  incentives  to   increase  affordable  options  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The  study  focused  on  identifying  financial   drivers  for  increasing  rental  stock,  financial  incentives  for  new  affordable  housing,  effectiveness  of   financial  incentive  tools  in  supporting  the  creation  of  both  rental  and  ownership  affordable  housing,   analysis  of  creating  new  and  improving  existing  secondary  units  for  homeowners,  and  outline   considerations  in  the  development  of  financial  incentive  strategy  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).   Additionally,  in  order  to  drive  the  success  of  the  Affordable  Housing  Program,  Mississauga  has   commented  on  the  National  Housing  Survey  (NHS)  and  has  requested  the  support  of  all  levels  of   government  in  helping  the  City  face  their  affordable  housing  issues  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).  The   report  suggests  that  the  continuous  funding  of  existing  social  housing,  and  creating  new  programs  for   new  affordable  ownership  and  purpose-built  rental  are  a  few  things  that  the  City  needs  in  order  to   successfully  implement  and  develop  an  Affordable  Housing  Program  (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).      Mississauga  also  has  a  huge  focus  on  secondary  units  as  an  affordable  option  for  households.  Not  only   does  it  alleviate  affordability  pressures  of  owners  but  could  provide  affordable  options  for  renters.  The   Second  Units  Registration  By-law  replaced  the  Second  Unit  Licensing  By-law  as  of  June  2016  (City  of   Mississauga,  n.d.).  "A  second  unit  is  a  self-contained  living  unit  within  a  detached,  semi-detached  house   or  townhouse"  (City  of  Mississauga,  n.d.).  Second  units  must  comply  with  the  Ontario  Building  Code,   Ontario  Fire  Code  and  the  Mississauga  Zoning  By-law;  owners  are  required  to  submit  an  application  to   the  City  to  legalize  units  (City  of  Mississauga,  n.d.).  Low  costs  of  registering  and  licensing  secondary   units  create  incentive  for  households  to  legalize  their  units  and  provide  the  opportunity  to  offer  an   additional  housing  option  for  households  (City  of  Mississauga,  n.d.).  This  program  has  identified  the   need  to  increase  affordable  housing  within  Mississauga  and  is  moving  toward  developing  a  program   that  can  address  these  issues.

5.4.  Not-for-Profit   5.4.1.   Habitat  for  Humanity  Halton-Mississauga  
   Habitat  for  Humanity  Halton-Mississauga  is  a  non-profit  organization  that  provides  affordable  housing   and  promotes  homeownership  (Habitat  for  Humanity  GTA,  2014).  It  embodies  5  core  values;  housing   for  all,  diversity  and  inclusiveness,  partnership,  faith  in  action  and  human  dignity  (Habitat  for  Humanity   Halton-Mississauga,  n.d.).The  organization  was  founded  on  Christian  principles  and  they  build   affordable  homes  in  partnership  with  low-income  families.  The  target  group  for  this  organization  is   toward  potential  homeowners  and  is  funded  through  donations,  grants  and  revenue  from  the  ReStores.   Habitat  ReStore  is  a  retail  store  concept  that  accepts  donated  items  including  overstock,  discontinued   items,  appliances,  etc.  and  sells  them  to  the  public  at  a  reduced  cost,  usually  around  30-70%  less  than   the  original  retail  value  (Habitat  for  Humanity,  n.d.).        Habitat  for  Humanity  Halton-Mississauga  was  created  in  1999  and  has  "continuously  offered  no   interest,  no  profit  home  mortgages  (capped  at  30%  of  the  home  income)  to  hard-working  families  in   need  and  who  agree  to  contribute  500  volunteer  hours  of  "sweat  equity"  as  the  down  payment  of  their   Habitat  home"  (Habitat  for  Humanity  Halton-Mississauga,  n.d.).  Although,  Habitat  for  Humanity   Halton-Mississauga  would  be  a  great  choice  to  help  some  low  income  households  in  Mississauga,  they   contribute  very  little  to  housing  supply.  On  average,  Habitat  for  Humanity  has  built  one  home  per  year,   but  have  recently  set  a  goal  to  build  75  homes  by  2019  (Habitat  for  Humanity  Halton-Mississauga,  n.d.).    

5.4.2.   Options  for  Homes  
   Options  for  Homes  (Options)  is  a  non-profit  developer  of  condominiums,  with  a  mission  to  help   individuals  achieve  homeownership  (Options  for  Homes,  2016).  They  have  a  model  called  `Pay  It   Forward'  that  has  helped  over  3,500  individuals;  it  involves  passing  along  cost-savings  and  offering   down  payment  support  (Options  for  Homes,  2016).  Established  in  1994,  Options  and  their  affiliated   organizations  have  provided  over  6,500  households  with  homeownership  opportunities  (Options  for   Homes,  2016).  They  ensure  that  they  are  building  quality  homes  and  use  Deltera,  a  member  of  the   Tridel  group  as  their  builder  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area  (Options  for  Homes,  2016).  Options  core   values  are  embedded  in  "community,  collaboration,  selflessness,  working  together  towards  a  common   goal  for  the  common  good"  (Options  for  Homes,  2016).

The  Options  Contribution  is  a  program  that  helps  with  down  payments  (Options  for  Homes,  2016).  The   loan  boosts  your  down  payment  to  about  10-13%  of  the  purchase  price  of  your  suite  (Options  for   Homes,  2016).  There  is  no  payment  due  until  you  sell  or  rent  your  suite,  and  the  loan  appreciates  by  the   same  percentage  as  the  resale  value  and  must  be  paid  back  in  full  (Options  for  Homes,  2016).  The  loans   that  are  repaid  go  back  into  the  reserve  that  funds  The  Options  Contribution  (Options  for  Homes,   2016).  Anyone  who  is  purchasing  a  home  with  Options  may  take  advantage  of  this  opportunity   (Options  for  Homes,  2016).      Options  for  Homes  is  a  great  choice  for  first-time  home  buyers,  young  families  or  seniors  that  wish  to   live  in  condominiums.  The  down  payment  program  helps  to  alleviate  the  barriers  associated  with   entering  homeownership.  They  only  provide  one  dwelling  type  so  it  does  not  cater  to  all  household   types  but  is  still  a  suitable  choice  for  many.      

5.4.3.   Analysis  of  Existing  Programs  
   The  programs  and  organizations  have  provided  a  good  understanding  of  the  existing  options  for   providing  affordable  housing  as  well  as  alleviating  affordable  housing  issues.  Common  themes  the   emerged  through  the  analysis  of  these  programs  include,  providing  down  payment  assistance,   increasing  housing  stability  and  the  need  for  financial  assistance  from  all  levels  of  government.     Providing  down  payment  assistance  is  an  important  aspect  of  increasing  access  to  affordable   homeownership.  As  housing  prices  increase  the  amount  required  to  purchase  a  home  also  increases;   housing  prices  are  increasing  at  a  much  faster  pace  than  incomes.  Additionally,  down  payments  are  one   of  the  largest  barriers  when  thinking  about  buying  a  home  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002;  Dietz  &  Haurin,   2003).  Increasing  housing  stability  was  another  common  theme  that  emerged  from  exisitng  programs.   Many  of  the  programs  had  objectives  to  improve  living  conditions  and  ensuring  housing  stability  for   both  owners  and  renters.  Improving  living  conditions  by  assisting  with  renovations  can  improve  housing   stability  because  it  reduces  the  risk  of  owners  not  paying  their  monthly  payments  due  to  large  repair   costs.  Housing  stability  also  allows  people  to  remain  in  their  homes  as  long  as  they  need  to  or  want  to   and  financial  assistance  to  improve  spaces  to  accommodate  for  accessibility  increases  housing  stability.   Assisstance  from  all  levels  of  governments  was  the  third  emerging  theme.  This  is  an  important  aspect   in  providing  affordable  homes  for  both  renters  and  owners.  Municipalities  do  not  have  the  financial   capacity  to  provide  affordable  ownership  units  for  residents  nor  do  they  have  the  capacity  to

5.  EXISTING  PROGRAMS  

continously  make  improvements  to  exisitng  structures.  There  is  a  need  and  responsibility  of  all  levels  of   government  to  participate  financially  in  alleviating  the  housing  affordability  issues  in  the  GGHA.      These  programs  have  demonstrated  a  good  foundation  and  framework  for  guiding  municipal  policies   and  programs  for  increasing  affordable  housing,  particularly  affordable  homeownership.  Programs   such  as  Ontario's  Long-Term  Affordable  Housing    Strategy  and  Peel's    Housing  and  Homelessness  Plan   do  not  directly  target  affordable  homeownership,  but  rather  provide  an  overarching  vision  for   improving  affordable  housing  in  general.  These  strategies  and  plans  are  guiding  frameworks  for  local   municipalities  to  create  programs  that  pertain  to  their  specific  needs.  Both  of  the  non-profit   organizations  champion  affordable  homeownership,  Habitat  for  Humanity  and  Options  for  Homes  have   different  ways  of  assisting  with  down  payments  and  providing  viable  options  for  households.   Additionally,  CMHC  also  provides  a  feasible  option  for  down  payment  assistance  in  the  form  of  a   forgivable  loan.  These  three  programs  are  a  gateway  into  homeownership  and  provide  potential   owners  with  the  opportunity  to  bypass  one  of  the  largest  barriers  when  making  the  decision  to  buy  a   home  (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002;  Dietz  &  Haurin,  2003).  The  City  of  Mississauga  Affordable  Housing   Program,  although  not  completely  procured,  is  definitely  a  valuable  asset  in  improving  affordable   homeownership.  This  program  has  not  only  identified  the  affordable  housing  issues,  but  has  plans  to   increase  affordable  housing  options  for  all    residents.

6.  RECOMMENDATIONS  

6.   RECOMMENDATIONS  
   Affordable  homeownership  is  a  major  concern  in  Mississauga  as  well  as  other  parts  of  the  GGHA.   Literature  has  suggested  the  benefits  of  having  affordable  housing  and  homeownership  not  only   contribute  to  the  quality  of  life  of  residents,  but  have  greater  socio-economic  benefits.  Urban   containment  policies  have  directed  growth  and  dictated  the  types  of  dwellings  that  are  likely  to  emerge   in  the  future.  This  has  contributed  to  pressures  on  both  supply  and  demand  on  low-rise  dwelling  types,   such  as  single-detached  houses.  The  decreasing  land  supply  encourages  mid-density  to  high-density   dwellings  to  accommodate  for  growth  in  the  GGHA  as  well  as  meet  policies  requirements  and  targets.      The  Province  of  Ontario  has  provided  plans  that  act  as  a  framework  to  guide  municipalities  to  develop   strategies  to  help  them  face  the  challenges  of  providing  affordable  housing  locally,  both  rental  and   ownership.  The  GGHA  is  a  unique  part  of  Ontario  and  has  very  different  attributes  as  far  as  growth  in   population  and  employment  than  the  rest  of  Ontario.  Similarly,  the  Region  of  Peel's  policies  and   programs  are  intended  to  guide  the  Region  in  fostering  livable,  vibrant,  complete  communities.   Improving  rental  affordability  will  minimize  the  gap  between  renters  and  owners  and  hopefully   encourage  more  renters  to  become  homeowners.  Mississauga's  Affordable  Housing  Program  is  a  step   in  the  right  direction  for  mitigating  the  affordability  issues  that  so  many  residents  currently  face.   Moving  into  the  next  20  years,  it  will  become  increasingly  important  to  support  affordable   homeownership  as  age  and  household  structures  being  transforming.  The  aging  population  and   increased  immigrant  migration  are  two  of  the  most  susceptible  household  types  to  housing   affordability  issues.  Over  the  next  20  years  these  two  groups  will  make  up  a  significant  portion  of  the   population  in  Mississauga.      This  section  provides  some  recommendations  that  the  City  of  Mississauga  should  undertake  to  begin   improving  affordable  homeownership  issues.  Some  of  these  recommendations  have  been  addressed   throughout  the  procurement  of  Mississauga's  Affordable  Housing  Program.  They  have  been  chosen  to   be  recognized  in  this  section  because  they  are  important  and  although  these  recommendations  are   directed  and  tailored  for  Mississauga,  they  can  be  used  to  guide  other  municipalities  in  improving   affordable  homeownership  issues.  

6.1.  Recommendation  1  ­  Vacant  Land  Inventory  
      45  

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  

  

6.  RECOMMENDATIONS  

The  City  of  Mississauga  has  an  inventory  of  vacant  lands  within  its  boundaries.  This  inventory  lists  all   the  vacant  lands,  their  zoning,  the  Official  Plan  designation,  the  size,  and  other  important  attributes.   The  City  should  identify  areas  of  potential,  where  new  housing  developments  could  occur.  Creating  a   map  and  an  inventory  of  owners,  zoning,  and  the  potential  highest  and  best  use  for  each  particular   piece  of  property  would  allow  the  City  to  identify  the  potential  areas  of  future  development.        For  example,  one  of  the  vacant  lots  is  located  in  the  Uptown  Major  Node  area,  is  in  a  corridor  and  a   major  transit  area.  It  is  3.30  ha,  designated  High  Density  in  the  Official  Plan,  zoned  residential  with   permitted  uses  being  apartment  dwellings.  The  maximum  height  of  part  of  the  land  is  25  storeys.  This  is   a  perfect  example  of  one  of  the  few  greenfield  spaces  left  in  the  city  that  could  be  used  to  facilitate   affordable  housing.        Mississauga  should  create  an  inventory  of  vacant  land  and  analyze  the  zoning  and  OP  designation  to   ensure  that  the  land  use  assigned  to  each  property  will  produce  the  highest  and  best  use  of  the  space.    

6.2.  Recommendation  2  ­  Use  Public  Lands  First  
   Land  prices  are  a  huge  barrier  to  producing  affordable  housing.  The  cost  of  the  land  is  a  huge   determinant  in  overall  selling  price  per  square  foot  of  properties.  The  City  has  already  put  forth  a   motion  to  use  public  land  for  affordable  housing  first.  They  have  identified  three  ways  that  the   municipality  can  do  this:   1.   Enter  into  a  land  lease   2.   Donate  land   3.   Provide  land  below  market  value   (City  of  Mississauga,  2016).      The  City  should  look  at  utilizing  surplus  lands  to  facilitate  affordable  housing.  Additionally,  they  should   look  at  existing  buildings  owned  by  the  City  that  are  in  need  of  care.  Looking  at  the  opportunity  to   redevelop  existing  built  form  to  increase  their  capacity  and  provide  better  quality  homes  for  current   residents  and  opening  up  more  space  of  new  residents.  Additionally,  The  Centre  for  Urban  Research   and  Land  Development  recently  produced  an  interactive  map  of  government  owned  public  lands  in  the   Greater  Toronto/Hamilton  Area  (Ryerson  University:  Centre  for  Urban  Research  and  Land   Development,  n.d.).  This  map  identifies  publicly  owned  lands  from  the  Federal,  Provincial  and  local  

  

46  

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  

  

6.  RECOMMENDATIONS  

Municipal  governments  as  well  as  their  local  agency  boards  and  commissions  (Ryerson  University:   Centre  for  Urban  Research  and  Land  Development,  n.d.).  The  map  provides  information  about  each  site   including,  address,  postal  code,  ownership,  size  and  land  use  as  well  as  other  characteristic  that   describe  the  site  (Ryerson  University:  Centre  for  Urban  Research  and  Land  Development,  n.d.).   Mississauga  could  use  this  inventory  to  begin  their  analysis  on  which  properties  would  be  ideal  for   increasing  supply  of  affordable  homeownership.  The  City  could  categorize  these  properties  based  on   surplus  lands  or  need  to  repair  or  redevelopment  that  could  be  leased,  donated  or  sold  at  an  affordable   price  as  an  incentive  to  increase  affordable  ownership  units.  

6.3.  Recommendation  3  ­  First  Time  Home  Buyers  Assistance  
   Down  payments  are  the  biggest  barriers  and  challenges  that  potential  home  buyers  face  (Painter  &   Redfearn,  2002;  Dietz  &  Haurin,  2003).  Both  non-profit  organizations  discussed  in  this  paper,  Options   for  Homes  and  Habitat  for  Humanity  as  well  as  CMHC  offer  incentives  and  programs  to  help  mitigate   the  burden  of  down  payments.  Through  Mississauga's  Affordable  Housing  Program  and  the  support  of   all  levels  of  government,  providing  assistance  to  help  first  time  home  buyers  achieve  homeownership,   may  alleviate  some  affordable  issues.  There  are  many  residents  that  are  in  the  rental  market  that  live   affordably;  if  there  was  assistance  for  a  down  payment  some  of  these  households  could  move  into   ownership  where  they  may  still  be  spending  less  than  30%  of  their  income  on  housing  costs,  opening  up   other  potential  affordable  units  for  other  renters.  

6.4.  Recommendation  4  ­  Education  for  Programs  
   Education  is  an  extremely  important  tool.  Many  of  the  programs  offered  by  CMHC  could  really  improve   affordable  housing.  There  is  a  lot  of  funding  provided  by  the  Federal  and  Provincial  government  that   many  households  could  take  advantage  of.  The  City  of  Mississauga  should  invest  in  creating   educational  programs  to  aid  residents  in  understanding  the  programs  that  are  available  to  them  to  help   alleviate  their  housing  affordability  issues.  

6.4.1.   Workshops  
   Developing  workshops  to  assist  residents  access  funding  for  affordable  housing  will  be  a  key  part  of   improving  the  issue  in  Mississauga.  Changing  demographics  increases  the  importance  of  education,  as   many  households  are  comprised  of  recent  immigrant  they  may  not  have  the  knowledge  about  

  

47  

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  

  

6.  RECOMMENDATIONS  

mortgages  and  may  require  financial  education,  or  older  adults  who  need  to  plan  for  retirement  and  are   not  sure  what  the  benefits  of  downsizing  are.  Some  example  workshops  include:   -   -   -   -   -   Program  Eligibility  ­  helping  residents  figure  out  what  programs  they  are  eligible  for.   Application  Assistance  ­  helping  residents  fill  out  applications  and  obtaining  all  the  necessary   information  for  their  application.   Financial  education  for  those  who  do  not  understand  mortgages  or  financing/refinancing   homes.   Importance  of  affordable  housing  ­  educate  residents  about  the  need  for  affordable  housing   and  why  it  is  important.   Benefits  of  Homeownership  ­  many  people  will  rent  their  whole  lives  without  knowing  some  of   the  benefits  (and  constraints)  to  homeownership,  but  a  workshop  on  educating  them  can  help   households  make  informed  decisions  about  their  housing  tenure.   -   Second  Unit  Legalization  ­  encouraging  the  legalization  of  second  units  in  households  and  the   importance  of  this  to  affordable  housing.  Additionally,  workshops  should  provide  residents  with   assistance  in  accomplishing  this.  

6.4.2.   Resource  Tool  Easy  for  Residents  to  Access  
   Another  way  to  increase  education  is  to  develop  a  tool,  similar  to  the  workshops,  is  to  create  an   interactive  tool  to  help  residents  understand  the  programs  that  are  available  to  them.  This  tool  could  be   on  the  City  of  Mississauga  website  and  allows  residents  to  filter  out  criteria  that  pertain  to  them  and   produce  programs  they  would  be  eligible  for.  

6.5.  Recommendation  5  ­  Incentives  for  Developers  to  Build  Affordable  Housing  
   Another  way  that  Mississauga  could  improve  affordable  housing  is  to  provide  developers  with   incentives  for  building  affordable  housing.  The  City's  Affordable  Housing  Program  is  looking  into  this.   Similar  to  section  37  incentives,  the  City  could  provide  developers  with  financial  compensations  and   other  zoning  requirements  in  lieu  of  providing  a  certain  percentage  of  affordable  units  within  a  building.   The  City  should  focus  on  providing  incentives  to  developers  that  develop  in  medium-  and  high-density   areas  to  optimize  the  number  of  affordable  ownership  units  being  developed.  This  is  important  as   housing  development  will  shift  toward  higher-density  developments  over  the  next  20  years.  

6.5.1.   Reduced  Fees  
      48  

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  

  

6.  RECOMMENDATIONS  

Mississauga  could  reduce  certain  fees  that  increase  development  costs  including,  development   charges,  fees  for  changes  in  plan  of  subdivisions,  or  condominium  after  the  initial  base  fee.  Additionally,   Mississauga  has  a  Site  Plan  Control  Bylaw  in  which  all  developments  must  have  a  Site  Plan  Approval,   the  cost  of  this  could  be  reduced.  By  reducing  some  of  the  costs  associated  with  development   approvals,  developers  may  be  able  to  construct  buildings  with  much  lower  soft  costs,  which  decrease   the  overall  cost  of  construction  and  hopefully  decrease  the  price/square  foot  for  potential  purchasers.  

6.5.2.   Reduced  parking  for  developments  close  to  transit  corridors  
   If  developers  are  building  high-density  buildings  within  transit  corridors,  they  could  opt  for  less  parking   in  place  of  providing  a  certain  percentage  of  affordable  units.  This  would  be  extremely  useful  for  high- density  developments  close  to  watercourses  that  make  underground  parking  difficult  or  not  possible.    

6.5.3.   Reduced  landscaping  requirements  
   Some  zones  in  Mississauga  zoning  by-law  require  a  large  portion  of  the  property  to  be  landscaped  (40%   in  some  areas),  however  the  City  could  provide  developers  with  the  incentive  to  reduce  this  if  they   produced  a  certain  percentage  of  affordable  units.    

6.6.  Recommendation  6  ­  Secondary  Units  
   Secondary  Units  are  part  of  the  city's  Affordable  Housing  Program.  They  have  replaced  their  previous   bylaw  about  secondary  units,  called  the  Second  Units  Registration  By-law  (By-law  114-16).  There  is  no   registration  fee  which  is  an  incentive  for  homeowners  to  legalize  their  second  units.  Second  units  not   only  decrease  unaffordability/housing  costs  for  current  homeowners,  but  also  increase  supply  of   affordable  units  for  renters.  This  should  be  one  of  the  primary  and  immediate  focuses  of  the  city  in   providing  affordable  housing,  because  it  exists  and  it  can  be  an  immediate  solution  to  housing  issues   now.    

6.7.  Recommendation  7  ­  Encourage  Wood-frame  Apartments  in  Medium-Density   Areas  
   Wood-frame  construction  costs  a  lot  less  than  pored  concrete.  The  Ontario  Building  Code  has  increased   the  number  of  floors  from  4  to  6  that  can  be  built  using  a  wood-frame.  This  could  provide  potential  for   affordable  ownership  units  in  medium-density  areas  by  reducing  the  construction  costs  of  dwellings   built  up  to  6  storeys.      49

6.  RECOMMENDATIONS  

6.8.  Recommendation  8  ­  Focus  on  Low-  and  Moderate-income  Households  
   Mississauga  has  clearly  identified  that  the  majority  of  residents  that  suffer  affordable  housing  issues  are   within  Decile  1  and  6,  these  households  are  classified  as  low-  and  moderate-income  households.  This   recommendation  is  to  ensure  that  the  Affordable  Housing  Program  focus  on  the  groups  that  are  the   most  vulnerable.  When  increased  supply  of  affordable  ownership  becomes  available,  the  city  needs  to   identify  who  has  first  priority.  The  City  should  recognize  the  households  that  have  deep  and  severe   housing  affordability  issues  and  ensure  that  these  households  have  first  priority  when  accessing   available  affordable  ownership  units.        Prioritizing  households  will  help  to  alleviate  some  housing  cost  pressures,  even  if  these  households  do   not  move  into  affordable  housing  (as  defined  by  spending  less  than  30%  of  income)  they  move  into   housing  that  is  more  affordable  than  they  were  previously.      

6.9.  Recommendation  9  ­  Inclusionary  Zoning    
   As  mentioned  in  the  Policy  section,  Inclusionary  Zoning  received  Royal  Assent  in  December  2016   (Ministry  of  Municipal  Affairs  and  Housing,  2017).  This  policy  could  shape  the  future  of  affordable   homeownership  in  Mississauga  and  other  municipalities  within  the  GGHA.  Inclusionary  Zoning  has  the   potential  to  increase  the  supply  of  affordable  housing  that  serves  the  needs  of  low-  to  moderate- income  households,  it  would  create  inclusive  and  integrated  communities,  and  it  would  help  meet  local   needs.      It  is  recommended  that  the  City  of  Mississauga  implement  Inclusionary  Zoning  as  a  requirement  for  all   new  condominium  developments  to  provide  units  that  are  affordable  for  low-  to  moderate-income   households.  This  means  that  units  should  cost  no  more  than  30%  of  households  before-tax  income  and   given  that  there  is  a  huge  potential  for  condominium  development  in  Mississauga's  future,  this   legislation  will  increase  affordable  housing.  Additionally,  Inclusionary  Zoning  will  increase  the  supply  of   affordable  units  over  time  through  gradual  development  of  new  condominiums,  increasing  the   sustainability  of  affordable  homeownership,  even  in  housing  prices  continue  to  increase.     

6.10.  
  

Recommendation  10  ­  Limited  Equity  Cooperatives  

  

50  

AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  

  

6.  RECOMMENDATIONS  

Limited  Equity  Cooperatives  are  a  form  of  affordable  housing  in  a  resident-controlled  environment  (We   Own,  2003).  This  type  of  housing  does  not  require  individuals  to  have  a  mortgage  on  their  unit.   Residents  share  purchase  price  and  these  shares  entitle  individuals  to  a  long-term  lease  on  a  unit  and  a   vote  in  cooperative  government  (We  Own,  2003).  Each  individual  is  both  a  tenant  through  the  lease   with  the  corporation  and  an  owner  through  stock  ownership  and  participation  in  group  governance  (We   Own,  2003).  This  affordable  housing  model,  allows  low-  to  moderate-income  households  purchase  low   cost  shares  and  are  guaranteed  a  unit  for  as  long  as  they  desire,  so  long  as  they  adhere  to  the  terms  of   their  lease.  It  requires  less  capital  than  a  down  payment  for  a  mortgage  and  allows  residents  with  a   voice  (through  a  vote)  in  major  decisions  pertaining  to  the  cooperative.  It  also  serves  as  a  sustainable,   long-term  solution  to  affordable  housing.  Sales  of  cooperative  stocks  are  determined  by  a  specific   formula  to  ensure  that  units  remain  affordable  for  future  and  current  residents  (We  Own,  2003).  CMHC   describes  shared  equity  tenure  as  an  easier  and  more  accessible  way  for  people  with  low  incomes  to   access  homeownership  (Canada  Mortgage  and  Housing  Corporation,  2017).        This  approach  is  recommended  to  the  City  of  Mississauga,  as  many  of  the  affordable  housing  issues  are   faced  by  low-  to  moderate-income  households.  Encouraging  various  affordable  housing  options,  such   as  limited  equity  cooperatives  will  increase  affordable  housing  in  the  city.  It  caters  to  residents  who  are   willing  to  play  an  interactive  role  in  managing  and  maintaining  their  residences  while  at  the  same  time   maintaining  affordability.  It  requires  shared  responsibilities  and  liabilities  of  all  members  of  the   cooperative  and  is  a  feasible  alternative  to  achieve  affordable  homeownership.        This  recommendation  also  addresses  a  need  for  change  in  legislation  and  financial  responsibility  of  all   levels  of  government.    Aging  population  and  changing  demographics  means  a  need  to  change  types  of   dwellings  including  providing  affordable  units  for  households  that  may  have  a  fixed  income  (retired   households).  A  change  in  legislation  and  an  increased  financial  responsibility  of  all  levels  of  government   to  support  housing  options  such  as  limited-equity  cooperatives  will  allow  for  more  efficient  and  specific   funding  solutions  to  alleviate  affordable  housing  issues.

7.   CONCLUSIONS  
   This  paper  has  focused  on  the  importance  of  affordable  housing.  In  particular,  it  addressed  literature   that  supports  affordable  homeownership  and  the  benefits  that  are  associated  with  ownership.   Homeownership  comprises  a  household's  largest  investment  and  it  is  often  the  main  form  of  savings   (Painter  &  Redfearn,  2002;  Hou,  2010;  McKee,  2012;  Begley,  2017).  This  research  is  important  in  the   Planning  realm  because  planning  plays  a  key  role  in  ensuring  high  quality  of  life  for  everyone.  This   paper  explores  Provincial  and  Regional  planning  policies  that  guide  and  act  as  a  framework  for  local   municipal  planning.  It  is  intended  to  enlighten  readers  about  current  affordable  housing  issues  and  of   the  existing  programs  that  intend  to  alleviate  and  improve  housing  affordability  issues,  particularly   affordable  homeownership  issues.        The  City  of  Mississauga  was  chosen  as  the  subject  of  this  paper  because  it  is  one  of  the  most  populous   cities  in  Canada  and  has  a  diverse  population  and  a  wide  range  of  housing  types.  It  is  an  urban  area   outside  the  main  urban  centre  that  is  Toronto,  and  although  there  are  pockets  that  resemble  traditional   suburban  life,  reliant  on  cars,  it  is  widely  connected  by  public  transportation  and  continues  to  improve   transit  to  connect  the  entire  city.  The  City  of  Mississauga  has  gathered  data,  analyzed  it  and  has   recognized  that  there  is  a  housing  affordability  issue.  The  City  is  currently  developing  a  plan  to  address   these  issues  and  have  identified  the  major  areas  of  concern.        The  recommendations  provided  in  this  paper  are  tailored  to  the  City  of  Mississauga,  but  have  the  ability   to  be  applied  to  other  municipalities  in  the  GGHA  that  are  also  facing  similar  affordable   homeownership  issues.  Although  housing  affordability  issues  are  unique  to  their  local  context,   municipalities  within  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  Area  are  similar  in  that  they  are  affected  by  urban   containment  policies,  natural  environments  and  huge  changes  in  population  growth,  age  and  structure   that  create  affordability  issues  not  faced  in  other  parts  of  the  Province.  These  recommendations  are   transient  and  can  be  tailored  to  local  needs  to  address  housing  affordability  issue.      The  intent  of  this  paper  was  to  create  an  understanding  of  affordable  housing,  particularly   homeownership.  The  benefits  that  are  associated  with  owning  a  home  and  how  improving   homeownership  could  create  a  butterfly  effect  that  has  a  positive  impact  on  housing  in  general.  This   paper  also  recognized  the  housing  trends  in  Canada,  Ontario  and  Mississauga,  and  used  this

7.  CONCLUSIONS  

information  to  help  inform  and  justify  that  there  is  in  fact  an  affordability  issue  in  the  Greater  Golden   Horseshoe.  The  recommendations  provide  viable  options  for  alleviating  current  housing  affordability   issues  and  increasing  the  supply  of  affordable  units.  Current  policies,  plans  and  programs  provide  some   solutions  to  these  issues,  the  recommendations  offer  an  addition  to  existing  solutions  and  provide   options  for  the  future  of  affordable  housing  in  municipalities  within  the  GGHA.  Owning  a  home  is   becoming  increasingly  unaffordable  and  this  paper  intended  to  provide  solutions  to  facilitate   sustainable  housing  options  for  Mississauga  residents.
