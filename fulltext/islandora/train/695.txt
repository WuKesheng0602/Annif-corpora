The Effects of Corrosion on the Perfonnance of Reinforced Concrete Beams Master of Applied Science 2007 Roger W. Smith Ovil Engineering Ryerson University

This report presents the results of a laboratory investigation into the effects of corrosion on
the structural behaviour of reinforced concrete (Rq beams. Twelve RC beams (156 x 176 x 1150 nun) were constructed, ten of v.hich were corroded to various levels by impressed current v.hile the remaining tv.o were set aside as the control beams. Each beam -was tested using non-destructive methods and then by four-point loading and the corresponding loads and deflections were recorded Following the mechanical testing, the tensile steel -was retrieved and cleaned in order to assess the mass loss. The results of this experiment clearly indicated a

dramatic shift in the nature of the failure of corroded RC beams. Specifically, it -was observed
in the present study that as corrosion increased the failure mode of the beams shifted from predictable ductile flexure failures at mid-span, to more brittle failures near the support. Based on the data collected, several new corrosion-dependant empirical relationships were established to model the altered responses of RC beams (ie. stiffness, deflection ratio, ductility, and toughness). In addition to beam tests, a pullout study -was conducted in an effort to identify the relationship between the reduction of load-carrying capacity and the residual bond strength of the tensile steel Other behavioural changes examined are initial cracking load, flexural crack development and the evolution of the failure mode. It -was found that the overall

IV

behaviour of the beam specimens tested confonns to that reported in the literature, with reductions in the ultimate capacity, deflection capacity and stiffness upon increasing corrosion. Also, the results of this experiment clearly indicated a dramatic shift in the nature of the failure of corroded RC beams. Specifically, it was observed that as corrosion increased, the failure mode of the beams shifted from predictable ductile flexure failures at mid-span, to more brittle failures near the support.

INTRODUCfION
1.1

The Problem of Corrosion

Reinforced concrete (Rq is a widely used construction material m the ~rld today and is generally very durable, yet there have been many occurrences of failures of such structures due to the corrosion of its reinforcement, as shown m Figure 1-1. One American study estimated that m 2001, there were approximately 235,000 RC bridges m that cotmtry, and over 21,000 of those were rated as structurally deficient and the leadIDg cause of deterioration for many of these deficient bridges is attributed to chloride-mduced corrosion (Koch et ai,
2001).

Figure 1·1: Parlcing garage failure due to cOITOsion (Fe1d and Catper, 1997).

The depassivation of the reinforcing steel can be attributed to either the ingress of chlorides or carbonation and leads to rapid corrosion. The corrosion of steel in concrete is one of the leading causes of deterioration of RC The corrosion of steel results in the reduction of the cross-sectional area of the rebar, much in turn reduces the steels ductility and strength. The products of corrosion occupy roughly 3 to 6 times the original volume of steel much exert tensile forces within the concrete causing the concrete to crack and spall resulting in a reduction of the steel-concrete bond Corrosion in RC structures poses a real problem with serious consequences. These include the degradation of the aesthetics and! or serviceability of a structure and the structural perlormance and its safety, all of much involve costly repairs. Corrosion is possibly the most pressing durability query of RC Currently, there is no suitable method by much to predict the behaviour and more importantly, the load-carrying capacity for beams deteriorated by corrosion of the reinforcing steel Furthennore, partial steel-toconcrete bond loss due to corrosion is not accounted for in conventional codes of practice. A beuer understanding of the effects of corrosion on RC v.ould no doubt aid in the development of new models to predict the residual strength of RC beams.

1.2 Objective and Scope
The objective of this project is to study how progressive corrosion affects reinforced concrete beams. Specifically, the aim is to investigate both qualitatively and quantitatively the changes in flexural crack development, mode of failure, stiffness, ductility, toughness, and load-carrying capacity of RC beams. The intention is to add to the body of knovAedge and broaden the understanding concerning the global behaviour of corroded RC beams in order

2

to facilitate the development of a numerical model to predict the behaviour of RC beams with corroded reinforcement that considers the effect of a panialloss of bond, 'Which will be the focus of future vvork To this end, existing research on the subject of bond strength of corroded reinforcement is reviewed with the goal of establishing a numerical relationship between bond strength and load-carrying capacity. Experimental studies have indicated that bond properties should be studied and modeled, as bond directly affects ductility, 'Which is associated with the mode of failure and ultimate capacity (Coronelli and Garnbarova, 2004).

CORROSION BASICS

2.1

Introduction

Corrosion is one of the most, if not the most, pressing durability queries of RC The following sections report on the fundamentals of some aspects of corrosion, including the conditions that lead to corrosion and factors that influence the rate of corrosion, with the focus on corrosion initiated by chloride ions, as this -was the mechanism used to initiate corrosion for the experimental \VOrk

2.2 Conditions for Corros ion
Corrosion of steel in concrete occurs only when both anodic and cathodic reactions are possible. An anodic reaction requires the depassivation of the steel bar, while oxygen must be available at the surface of the steel bar for a cathodic reaction. For these reactions to be possible, there must be conditions that allow a flux of ions and electrons between the anode and cathode. Ions are transported through the environment or electrolyte, while electrons migrate via a metallic connection (Hunkeler, 2005).

2.3 Electrochemical Process
Corrosion is an electrochemical reaction wherein electrons flow from the anodic to the cathodic sites in the presence of both water and oxygen. Equation 2-1 and Equation 2-2

5

represent the anodic and cathodic reactions respectively and these reactions are illustrated in Figure 2-1. The Addition of Equation 2-1 to Equation 2-2 results in Equation 2-3. The product of Equation 2-3 is ferrous hydroxide, vvru.ch fonns on the surface of the iron. At the outer surface of this oxide layer, oxygen reacts with the ferrous hydroxide to form hydrous ferric oxide or ferric hydroxide, as represented by Equation 2-4. Ferric hydroxide then becomes hydrated ferric oxide as represented by Equation 2-5. These reactions are illustrated
in Figure 2-2. The majority of ordinary rust consists of hydrous ferric oxide and is orange to

red- brown in colour (Roberge, 2000) .

2.4 Concrete's Defence against Corrosion
Reinforced concrete can be a very durable building material with many inherent qualities to protect the reinforcing steel from the initiation of corrosion. These qualities include its resistive nature, a microstructure that serves as a physical barrier against transport processes, and a high alkaline pore solution.

2.4.1 Resistivity of Concrete
The resistivity of concrete is an important factor in the corrosion process and is detennined by the moisture content and pore structure of the concrete and the composition of the water
in its pores. The conduction inside concrete occurs mainly through the movement of ions in

the pore solution. These ions include, Na+, K+, OH-, S042-, and Ca++ (Guet ai, 2001). The value of the electrical resistivity of the pore solution in cement paste typically ranges from 25 to 35 Qcm. On the other hand, the resistivity of standard aggregates used in concrete ranges from 105 to 1014 Qcm, making them good insulators.

7

Moisture content greatly affects the electrical resistivity of concrete such that the resistivity of air-dried concrete and moist concrete ranges from 0.6 to 1.2 MQcm and from 2.5 to 4.5
kQcm respectively (Gu et al., 2001).

Resistivity can be understood by studying its reciprocal, which is the conductivity of concrete. Figure 2-3 plots the relationship between conductivity and relative humidity, sho-wing that the conductivity is zero \\hen the relative humidity is between 40 and 80% (Hunkeler, 2005).

2.4.2 Transport Processes in Concrete
The corrosion process not only requires the movement of electrons, but also the transport of gases (02, C02), ions (0...-), and water. Good quality concrete will physically impede the movement of these substances and protect the reinforcing steel against corrosion. The transport of the gases, ions and water depends on the transport mechanism, the concrete properties, the binding between the substance being transported and the hydrated cement

8

paste, and the microclimate at the surlace of the concrete. This is swnmarized in Figure 2-4 (Bertolini et al., 2004).

The motivation of these substances is caused by ~ion (gradients of pressure), diffusion (gradients of concentrations), capi/Jdry farcE (inside the cement paste), and rrigration (resulting from electrical potential gradients). This is outlined in Table 2-1 (Bertolini et al., 2004).

According to Malhotra and Carino (2004), there are five key principles that must be understood Vv'hen describing the movement of aggressive substances through concrete; these principles are described below.
A dsaption - The process by Vv'hich molecules are attracted to the internal surfaces of

concrete. This can be from either chemical bonds or the forces of adhesion (i.e. van der Waals force).
A bsaption - The process by Vv'hich the concrete pores are filled with a liquid by capillary

suction. The rate at Vv'hich liquid is taken in is known as absorptivity or sorptivity.

10

r

Diffusim - The process by which liquids, gases, or ions are motivated through concrete by
vvay of a molar concentration gradient. This process is described by a diffusivity value or a diffusion coefficient.

Perm:ahility - An inherent concrete propeny that describes the reslStance of a fluid
penetration that is motivated by vvay of a pressure gradient. This is often confused with poroSIty.
P~ity

- This is the proportion of the total vohune that is occupied by pores, usually

expressed as a percentage.

2.4.3 Passive Layer
Another important characteristic of concrete is the high alkalinity of the pore solution, which is comprised of mainly sodium and potassium hydroxides, with a pH ranging from 12.6 to 13.8. At this pH leveL a protective (or passive) film is spontaneously formed during the early stages of cement hydratioIL This passive film may grow to a thickness of the order of 10-3 to
10- 1 JLm and contains hydrated iron oxides. The theory of the existence of this passive layer is

based only on indirect evidence of anodic polarization measurement. There is still much to be learned concerning this passive film, such as the conditions of its formation, and its chemical and mineralogical composition. It is possible that this passivating film consists of several phases (Ramachandran,2001).

11

2.5 Chloride-Induced Corrosion
The steel can be depassivated by chloride ions or the process known as carbonatiod. The introduction of chlorides into concrete can occur by "Way of contamination or additives in the original mix or through environmental exposure (e.g. de-icing salt). Chlorides introduced to the original mix initiate corrosion immediately, "Whereas chlorides introduced from an external source accumulate over time, eventually leading to a condition "Where corrosion is initiated (Gu et al., 2001). According to Hunkeler (2005), the negative effect of chlorides on RC is fourfold: ·
·

A reduction of the solubility of Ca(OH;)2 resulting in a lowered pH of the pore "Water.
An increase in the moisture content of the concrete due to the hydroscopic nature of

salts (e.g. NaG, Caa~. · · A rise in the electrical conductivity of the concrete. The destruction of the passive layer making corrosion possible.

2.6 Mechanisms of Chloride Attack
The "Way in -which chloride ions depassivate reinforcing steel is currently under speculation. According to Gu et al. (2001), there are three modem theories that propose the mechanisms of the chloride attack on reinforcing steel A short summary of each theory is provided below.

1 Carbonation of concrete is caused by the chemical reaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (C0 2) and the alkaline components ofthe cement paste (e.g. NaOH, KOH, Ca(OHh and calcium-silicate hydrates) in the presence of water which tend to neutralize the alkalinity ofthe concrete (Hunkeler, 2005).

12

,
~ Oxide Film Theory -The oxide film is thought to be responsible for the passivity of the

steel As chloride ions can penetrate the oxide film easier than other ions (such as

so;-) ,

they eventually fonn colloids and dispeISe the oxide film, making it more susceptible to corroSIon.
~ A dsarption

Theory - This theory holds that chloride ions in competition with oxygen or

hydroxyl ions are adsOlbed to the reinforcing steel The chloride ions promote the hydration of iron ions, facilitating corrosion
~

Traniwry CanrJex Theory - This theory states that chloride ions become incorporated in

the passive film, replacing some hydroxides. This process increases the conductivity and solubility of the passive layer, thus reducing its protective qualities.

2.7 Deterioration Process
The deterioration process of RC beams can be divided into four stages:
s~ I -

Marked by the initiation of corrosion when the reinforcing steel is depassivated by

either a chloride or a carbonation auack
Sta~

II - Denoted by the propagation of corrosion, ~ch leads to the cracking of the

concrete and rust staining on the swface.
Sta~

III - Indicated by cracking and delaminating of the concrete, accelerating the rate of

corrosion due to the increased accessibility of moisture and chloride ions.
Sta~ IV -

Typified by spalling of the concrete cover, exposing the reinforcing steel to the full

impact of the corrosive environment.

13

These four stages are illustrated in Figure 2-5 (Higgins et al., 2003).

The structural consequences of corrosion, such as a reduction in the rebar cross-sectional area and the mechanical properties of the steeL are shown in Figure 2-6. The products of corrosion cause tensile stresses in the concrete that produce cracks, spalling, and! or delamination, resulting in the deterioration of the steel-concrete bond These effects are initiated by corrosion and their severity increases overtime (Bertolini et ai, 2004).

These consequences of corrosion can ultimately lead to the failure of a structure. A disaster of this nature can be extremely costly to society due to the loss of time, revenue and property upon the removal and disposal of the debris and replacing of the structure. More importantly, there is a potential for loss of life in the event of a structural failure (MacGregor and Bartlett, 2000). In order to avoid a catastrophic failure, engineers must be able to detennine v.hen a deteriorated structure requires repair or replacement. The strength of a RC member with corroded reinforcement cannot be determined by conventional cross-section analysis due to the loss in both the bond strength and bond rigidity; as mechanical properties of the reinforcing steel (Lee et ai, 2002). Currently, there is no suitable method to assess the reduction in the load-carrying capacity of a corroded RC beam. Therefore, a new method of evaluating the strength of RC members damaged by reinforcement corrosion is needed. This method should consider the reduction of the bond and mechanical properties of the corroded steel

Introduction

It is known that the load-carrying capacity of reinforced concrete (RQ beams is reduced with increasing corrosion. Numerous published papers have focused on measuring this reduction as well as analysing changes to the structural response of RC beams. This section provides an overview of the ftmdamentals of conventional flexural theory and highlights a selection of research papers discussing corroded RC beams.

For conventional RC beam analysis and design, tv\{) requirements must be satisfied The first is that at any given point, the stress must correspond with the strain (except in the case of short, deep beams). This is also known as stress and strain compatibility. The second requirement is that the internal forces must be in equilibrium The stresses and forces in a rectangular beam are illustrated in Figure 3-1 (MacGregor and Bartlett, 2000).

When a simply supported beam is loaded and the stresses at the bottom reach the tensile strength of the concrete, the beam cracks and its curvature increases. At this point, the tensile force is transferred to the reinforcing stee~ reducing the stiffness of the beam The curvature

is the strain at distance y from the neutral axis (MacGregor and Bartlett, 2000).

This curvature can be plotted -with its corresponding load level in what is known as a moment-curvature diagram. A simply supported RC beam is typically assumed to reach its maximum capacity when the slope of the moment-curvature diagram equals zero (MacGregor and Bartlett, 2000).

3.3 Selected Research
3.3.1 Uomoto and Misra
Uomoto and Misra (1988) investigated the influence of longitudinal cracking on beams and columns. The reinforcement was corroded by adding chlorides in the concrete mix and
impressing a current ranging from 280 to 380 [lA/ cmz over a 7 to 14 day period The beams

tested had dimensions of 200 x 100 x 2100 mm and were reinforced with 2-6 mm diameter top bars and 2-16 mm diameter bOllom bars. These beams failed when the compression-concrete crushed and the top bars buckled Uomoto and Misra found that a weight loss in the tension reinforcement ranging from 1 to
2.4% resulted in a 4 to 17% reduction in the load-carrying capacity. These researchers

auributed this reduction in the capacity of the beams to a decrease in the reinforcement area and concrete cracking (Uomoto and Misra, 1988).

3.3.2 Al-Sulaimani et al.
Al-Su1airnani et al (1990) conducted tests to detennine the manner in which cracking and reinforcement corrosion affect the behaviour of the steel-concrete bond For this purpose, tests were performed on pullout specimens and 24 beam specimens having dimensions of 150 x 150 x 1000 with a 12 mm diameter bOllom-reinforcing bar. Corrosion was induced by the application of a constant current density of 2 ruN cnr. The behaviour of the beams was observed at four stages of corrosion: no corrosion, pre-cracking corrosion, corrosion at the appearance of the first visible cracks, and post-cracking corrosion (Al-Su1airnani et al., 1990).

For the beams designed to fail in flexure (series IV), adequate development length and shear stirrups vvere provided to prevent bond or shear failures. The results of this portion of the experimental work are shown in Table 3-1. The ultimate load at 0% corrosion was found to

be 47.0 kN and 47.2 kN. Figure 3-2 summarizes the findings of AI-Sulaimani et ai and
graphically illustrates how the ultimate load is affected by steel cross-section loss (AISulaimani et ai, 1990). For each beam tested, the average bond stress over the embedded length was found to be vvell belowthe ultimate bond stress observed in pullout tests for bars with similar corrosion.

This observation confinned that the failure of the beams in series IV was due to the yielding
of steel and was not a bond failure (AI-Sulaimani et ai, 1990). Furthennore, since the bond stress was less than the ultimate bond stress, AI-Sulaimani et ai (1990) concluded that the reduction in beam capacity was not due to a decrease in bond stress but rather, it could be auributed primarily to the reduced area of the reinforcing steel
As this conclusion was reached many years ago, it is contradicted by many researchers today

(Mangat and Elgart, 1999; AI-Negheimish and AI-Zaid, 2004; Castel et ai, 2000b).

3.3.3 Cabrera and Ghoddoussi
Cabrera and Ghoddoussi (1992) researched the effects of corrosion on beams of 160 x 125 x
1000 mrn, reinforced -with 2-10 mm diameter bars at the top, 2-12 mm diameter bars at the

bottom and 8 mm diameter stirrups. The main tensile reinforcing bars were corroded by applying an unknown current density. The maximum reduction in the steel cross-sectional area was 9%, which resulted in a 20% reduction in the ultimate bending moment and a 40% increase in deflection at the service load (Cabrera and Ghoddoussi, 1992).

3.3.4 Eyre and N okhasteh
Eyre and Nokhasteh (1992) examined the behaviour of concrete beams -with exposed reinforcement. In the tests performed, the concrete-steel interface "WclS assumed to have zero bond over various lengths of the beam and the capacity of the beam was observed to reduce -with smaller bond lengths. Moreover, after a critical un-bonded length, the beams failed by the concrete crushing, regardless of steel ratio.

20

~-

This led Eyre and Nokhasteh

to

propose an algebraic method for predicting the ultimate

strength of corroded RC beams. Ho-wever, according to Maaddawy et a1. (200Sa), this method assumes that concrete acts as a linear-elastic material and thus does not properly reflect the stress-strain behaviour of concrete, and pres tunes a total loss of bond, "'Which does not reflect actual conditions.

3.3.5 Huang and Yang
Huang and Yang (1997) carried out tests that illustrate the relationship bet-ween the corrosion of RC beams and load-carrying capacity. Beams of 150 x 150 x 500 mm, reinforced with two 6 mm bottom bars -were corroded by immersing them in sea water and applying a current of
5 N cm2· The two specimen types used -were beams without cracks (type S) and beams with a

middle surface crack (type K), and the t\\Q concrete mix designs used -were mix A and mix B, having a waterto cement ratio (wi c) of 0.4 and 0.3 respectively. Figure 3-3 and Figure 3-4 show the relationship of corrosion to stiffness and ultimate moment for concrete types A and B. The reduction in load-carrying capacity as corrosion thickness increased was more significant in beams with a low wi c or predetermined cracks

(mix B or type K). Huang and Yang concluded that this behaviour was a result of the
chloride ions having easier access
to

the reinforcing steel in cracked beams than in un-

cracked ones (Huang and Yang, 1997). The fact that the beams made with a lo-wer wic ("'Which makes for a higher strength concrete), displayed a less favourable response seemed to be counter-intuitive. The authors addressed this and explained the behaviour by saying that, "... lo-wer mnerl cement ratio concretes have smaller pores, "'Which show lo-wer energyabsOlbing capacity", and that after

21

cracking, beams made of high strength concrete may fail before ones of low strength concrete (Huang & Yang, 1997).

In terms of pore size, a supplementary explanation is available. That is, concrete that has smaller pores cannot accommodate voluminous rust products as well as concrete with larger pores. 1bis is because the existence of larger pores allows the oxides to migrate more easily into the matrix of the concrete, thus reducing the expansive tensile stresses. Conversely, concrete -with smaller pores is more greatly influenced by rust products and experiences larger internal stresses, resulting in a more rapid deterioration of the concrete (Amleh, 2005).

3.3.6 Rodriguez et at.
Rodriguez et al (1997) completed experimental "WOrk on 31 beams with dimensions of 200 x
150 x 2300 mm and 200 x 150 x 2050 mm In order to study the interaction between

corrosion and loading, Rodriquez et al varied the corrosion and the detailing of the reinforcement. Corrosion -was accelerated by adding 3% calcium chloride by weight to the mixing water. After 28 days of curing, a current of 100 IJ-A/ cm2 -was applied for 100 to 200 days. The study revealed that corrosion increases deflections and crack -widths at the service load, decreases strength at the ultimate load, and causes an increase in both the spacing and -width of transverse cracking due to bond deterioration It -was also observed that corrosion could change the type of failure experienced by RC beams -with typical reinforcement ratios. In this case, un-corroded beams failed mostly by bending and corroded beams failed mostly by shear. Figure 3-5 depicts the types of failures that were observed by Rodriguez et al. (1997) when testing corroded beams, as detailed below.

23

Type 1 - occurred in both corroded and un-corroded beams with a low tensile reinforcement ratio. Type 2 - was produced in beams with un-corroded tensile reinforcement of a high ratio and most corroded beams with a high ratio of shear reinforcement. Type 3 - occurred in nearly all beams having a high ratio of corroded tensile bars and large strrrup spacmg. Type 4 - was found in corroded and un-corroded beams with curtailed tensile reinforcement.

Moreover, Rodriguez et al (1997) concluded that by using the reduced sections of steel and concrete with conventional RC models, conservative values of the ultimate moment and shear force can be calculated for RC members damaged by corrosion However, this method of calculating the strength of damaged members is deficient in that it fails to consider the reduction of bond

3.3.7 Mangat and Elgarf
Mangat and Elgarf (1999a) carried out an extensive research program on 111 tUlderreinforced concrete beams in order to study their residual flexural capacity after being subjected to various levels of corrosion CDrrosion was induced at four different rates by applying a current of either 1, 2, 3, or 4 mAl cm2· Nine groups of beams were fabricated, having dimensions of 100 x 150 x 910 (Mangat and Elgarf, 1999a). Load-deflection relationships were then developed, showing that when the degree of corrosion is greater than 2.5%, load-deflection curves become dependant on the rate of corrosion. In light of this, the researchers suggested that when accelerated corrosion testing is necessary, the lowest practical corrosion rates should be used to induce corrosion, panicularlywhen the desired degree of corrosion is high (Mangat and Elgarf, 1999a). The rate of corrosion was also fotUld to have an affect on the flexural load capacity. When corrosion is less than 3.75%, the rate of corrosion has little influence on the residual strength. CDnversely, when corrosion is greater than 5%, an increase in the rate of corrosion greatly reduces the flexural strength of RC beams (Mangat and Elgarf, 1999a). Regression analysis of the experimental data led to the proposal of a numerical relationship between residual flexural strength and the level of corrosion, as seen in Equation 3-2, where
B is the percent flexural load capacity, R is the rate of corrosion in

mmIyear, and t is the

elapsed time in years after corrosion initiation The expression 2~b in Equation 3-2 is the fonnula for the degree of corrosion as a percentage reduction in bar diameter. This equation is plotted in Figure 3-6 (Mangat and Elgarf, 1999a).

25

Equation 3-2

Mangat and Elgarl (1999a) were able to write Equation 3-2 in tenns of corrosion current density icorr ' deriving Equation 3-3. The researchers claim that this equation can be used to create nomograms for detennining the residual strength of beams -with. corroded reinforcement (Mangat and Elgarl, 1999).

The effect of the curing time prior to the initiation of corrosion was also investigated in this study. A number of beams were cured for periods of 16 days, 28 days, 6 months, and 1 year and then corroded to 5% corrosion (at 3 mN cm1. The residual strengths for all of these beams were close to 70% of the control beams. This finding allowed Mangat and Elgarl (1999a) to conclude that the curing period before corrosion (up to 1 year) has no bearing on flexural strength (Mangat and Elgarl, 1999a).

It was also determined that corrosion has a significant effect on the deflection and capacity of RC beams and the reduction in steel cross-sectional area due to corrosion has an insignificant effect on the residual flexural strength of beams. This reduction of the flexural capacity is attributed to the reduced steel-concrete bond (Mangat and Elgarl, 1999a), which is in direct opposition to the position taken by Al-Sulaimani et al. (1990).

27

..
3.3.8 Castel et al.
Castel et ai (2000a & 2000b) conducted long-tenn experimental research to investigate the mechanical behaviour of RC beams -with corroded reinforcement and published their findings in tm:> separate parts. In the first part, four beams -with dimensions of 150 x 280 x 3000 nun were studied These beams were naturally corroded in a salt fog environment for 14 years in an attempt to emulate actual field conditions. They were then subjected to three-point loading to determine their ultimate strength. The average reported degree of corrosion -was 10% and the reduction
in flexural strength -was 20% with a 70% reduction in ductility (Castel et ai, 2000a).

Several assumptions were fonnulated, including the idea that concrete cracks resulting from compression reinforcement corrosion have an insignificant effect on the global behaviour of RC beams. The authors did acknowledge, however, that other researchers have established that this type of cracking can reduce the flexural capacity by causing compressive concrete splitting (Castel et ai, 2000a). The researchers also proposed that the decrease in stiffness -was due to the reduction of both the steel cross-sectional area and bond strength. This -was attributed to the fact that the average maximum cross-section loss near the centre of the beam -was 20%, which \\Quld theoretically result in a stiffness decrease of 15%. However, the total stiffness loss for one of the beams tested -was 35%. Thus, there -was a 20% difference in loss that -was tUlaccotUlted for, which the researchers suspected to be the result of bond deterioration (Castel et ai, 2000a).

28

Additionally, the reduction of ultimate strength was found to correspond to the average maximum steel cross-section loss (20%). Therefore, Castel et ai (2000a) concluded that the reduction in steel-concrete bond had an insignificant effect on the ultimate behaviour and thus the residual capacity can be determined by considering the reduction of steel alone. The purpose of the second pan of this study was to funher explore the separate and coupled affects of bond stress and a decrease in steel cross-sectional area. Beams with similar dimensions to those in the first pan of the study were used to facilitate this second pan. Bond loss was simulated by notching the concrete and exposing the reinforcing bar, ~e a corrosion-pitting attack was simulated by using a grindstone to create local indentations on the steel surtace (Castel et ai, 2000b).

Upon analyzing the data, the researchers hypothesized that pitting corrosion located between flexural cracks has little influence on the global behaviour of RC beams -when bond strength

is not modified Conversely, -when both bond strength and steel cross-section were reduced
in their study, the global behaviour of RC beams was greatly altered This was attributed to the increase in steel stress at the crack location, due to the reduction of both steel crosssectional area and tensile concrete contribution (Castel et ai, 2000b). In sum, these researchers concluded that the corrosion of RC beams is al-ways a, " ... coupling phenomenon between steel cross-section reduction... and loss of bond strength." For this reason, both effects must be considered -when attempting to predict the residual strength or non-fragile behaviour (Castel et al., 2000b).

Wang et ai (2000) tested beams having dimensions of 100 x 150 x 1170 rnrn, reinforced with one 19 rum diameter bonom bar. The reinforcement was corroded by exposing the beams to a NaO solution and impressing current. The beams -were simultaneously corroded and loaded, using either sustained or previous (cyt:lic) loading. Details concerning specimen names and their loading type are summarized in Table 3-2.

The researchers fOllild that at higher loading levels, the corrosion initiation time was reduced while corrosion propagation was more severe. In addition, sustained loading had a more significant effect on the rate of corrosion than did eyt:lic loading and the rate of corrosion
was increased with higher load levels for both types of loading (Wang et ai, 2000).

These findings can be explained in terms of the access chloride ions had to the reinforcing steel At higher loading levels, crack widths are wider and thus allow for an easier ingress of chloride ions. Additionally, these cracks are continuously open and widening with sustained loading, facilitating the migration of the chloride ions. In contrast, cyt:lic loading causes these cracks to constantly open and close giving chlorides intermittent access, .wnch results in a relativelyslo-wer rate of corrosion (Amleh, 2005).

Figure 3-9 summarizes the deflection ratios that v.;ere observed by Ballim and Reid (2003), which v.;ere calculated by dividing the average deflections of the corroded beams with those of the control beams. This graph indicates that the deflection increased as corrosion propagated, particularly at the early stages. The researchers attributed this initial increase in deflection to early crack formation, as the crack creation and widening progressed at a slov.;er rate after a certain point (Ballim and Reid, 2003).

32

3.3.11 Maaddawy et al.
Maaddawy et ai (2005a) published a report on detennining the flexural behaviour of corroded RC beams, the main objective of -Mllch was
to

model the deflection of RC beams.

In this study, deflection was not detennined from the curvatures of beam sections, but rather from the elongation of the steel reinforcement between flexural cracks. Their research led Maaddawy et ai to propose a model that accotUlts for reductions in both bond strength and steel cross-sectional area.

This model asstUlles beams to be comprised of a series of elements with a length equal to the
mean crack spacing, -Mllch are subjected to a constant pure bending moment and have a single crack (initiated when the applied moment exceeds the cracking moment) located at the middle. The stress and strain of the tensile steel are the highest at this crack location. Some of

this stress and strain are transferred to the concrete via the concrete-steel bond, thus
reducing the steel strain and elongation, -Mllch in tum decreases the beam deflection (Maaddawyet ai, 2005a). The model also assumes that the bond stress distribution is uniform over the length of each element and its direction is reversed at the centre of the element. The maximtUll bond stress
is estimated by considering the contributions of both concrete and stirrups to the bond

strength and a reduction factor is employed to account for corrosion (Maaddawy et ai, 2005a).

This factor is based on experimental "\\Qrk (conducted by Saifullah and Clark4), yet it may be
suitable only for laboratory situations. This is because the reduction factor is dependent upon the current density applied to induce corrosion, -Mllch does not occur in the field Therefore,

33

,..

while tills bond model might be acceptable for the experimental W)rk in tills case, a different model should be considered for the assessment of beams with un-accelerated corrosion. TIlls model uses bond strength to establish the mean crack spacing and steel elongation for RC beams. Beam deflection is then based on the calculated steel elongation and thus the prediction of deflection is dependant on bond strength. On the other hand, the way in vAllch the maximum capacity of the beam is determined does not consider bond strength. Specifically, it is calculated using conventional strain compatibility equations once the strain in the extreme fibre of concrete reaches the limiting compressive strain. Since the maximum capacity is determined using the limiting compressive strain, its value will be affected by reductions in compressive strength of the concrete in the compressive zone. Yet, this model fails to take into account the reduction of concrete compressive strength resulting from micro-cracking due to corrosion. In sum, the model proposed by Maaddawy et al (2005a) is suitable for determining the loaddeflection curve of a corroded beam and the reduction of load-carrying capacity (the load at vAllch the steel yields) can then be inferred from this curve. Ho-wever, indirectly determining the ultimate capacity in tills manner may byinaccurate since the reduction in bond strength is not directly considered It is important not to ignore bond strength, since its reduction can cause an anchorage failure and the forces transferred from the concrete to the tensile steel may not be sufficient to cause the steel to yield

Chapter 4

BOND BETWEEN CONCRETE AND REINFORCING STEEL
4.1 Introduction
Conventional flexural theory of RC beams presmnes a complete transfer of tensile stresses from the concrete to the reinforcing steel 'This transfer is only possible by -way of the steelto-concrete bond, and therefore, a reduction in bond strength will result in a decrease of flexural capacity. 'This relationship marks the vital role bond strength plays in the development of the ultimate load-carrying capacity of corroded RC bearn;.

4.2 Bond Basics
The primary mechanism of bond is the mechanical interlocking between concrete and bar deformations. The strength of the bond is greatly influenced not only by the deterioration of the ribs on the reinforcing steeL but also by the reduced cohesion and adhesion at the surface of the steel due to the widening of splitting cracks caused by corrosion products. Specifically, bond strength at the steel-concrete interface rapidly decreases when the corrosion level increases. 'This is particularly the case when there is highly localized corrosion, which causes a major reduction of the interlocking forces between the ribs and concrete keys (Amleh and

Mirza, 1999).

4.3 Selected Research
Many researchers are working towards the development of an accurate model to predict bond strength -with respect to COrroSioIl Both residual and ultimate steel-concrete bond strengths have been the subject of many published papers, a few of which are discussed below.

4.3.1 Amleh and Mirza
Amleh and Mirza (1999) concluded that as the level of corrosion increases, the number of transverse cracks decrease lllltil they become negligible. In addition, these researchers fOlllld that a 4% weight loss of steel resulted in transverse cracks and a bond loss of 9%. Conversely, a weight loss of 17.5% corresponded to a 92% loss of bond with no transverse cracks. As the level of corrosion increased, the widths of these transverse cracks also increased, indicating a reduction of steel-concrete bond

4.3.2 Al-Negheimish and Al-Zaid
AI-Negheimish and AI-Zaid (2004) conducted research on the manner in which the manufacturing process of deformed bars affects bond behaviour. Their investigation included an assessment of the bond characteristics of hot-rolled and quenched bars, which showed consistent ultimate bond strength trends. That is, increasing corrosion resulted in an initial decrease, followed by a gradual increase and then a rapid loss of bond strength at the end. AI-Negheimish and AI-Zaid (2004) also observed that for a mass loss of approximately 1.5%, all of the bars tested showed similar final bond strength reductions of approximately 10%. While the quenched bars experienced the greatest mass loss, this did not adversely affect the bond behaviour.

36

4.3.3 Romagnoli et al.
Romagnoli et ai (2002) reported that an increasing water
to

cement ratio resulted in a

decrease in bond strength between the steel and concrete mortar, which was attributed to the increasing porosity of the cement paste. 'This is because as the porosity increases, a greater number of locations that lack binding material exist on the surface of the steel

4.3.4 Fang et al.
Fang et ai (2004) perlormed pullout tests in order to evaluate the influence of corrosion on bond in RC It was found that specimens with deformed bars that had stirrups responded minimally to corrosion That is, at 6% corrosion, the bond strength was reduced by only
12%. The researchers explained this by stating that the confinement supplied was sufficient
to

enable the retention of bond strength.

Conversely, they reported that bond strength was very sensmve for specimens with deformed bars having no stirrups, such that "'\\hen the corrosion level CL was 9%, the bond strength was reduced by 66%. The corrosion level was calculated using Equation 4-1, "'\\here
Go is the initial weight of the un-corroded bar, G is the weight of the bar after the removal

of corrosion products, go is the weight per unit length of the bar, and l is the bond length (Fang et ai, 2004).

The test specimens consisted of RC slabs, RC beams, and concrete cubes with a centrally located bar.

Stanish et ai (1999) conducted research on one-way slabs measuring 350 mm (width) by 150 mm (thickness) with a span of 1300 mm. Based on the experimental program and subsequent mathematical analysis, the peak bond strength at various corrosion levels was estimated The bond strength was nonnalized (or divided by the square root of the 28 day compressive strength

specimens. After a linear regression analysis was perlonned with a 95% confidence limit, the mean predictor equation (Equation 4-5) and the lo~r 95% confidence level equation (Equation 4-6) ~re obtained, where the bond strength et ai, 1999).

EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM
5.1 Methodology of Research
The present study involves the construction, corrosion, and mechanical testing of twelve reinforced concrete beam specimens. For each beam specimen, a pullout specimen was constructed and exposed to the exact same conditions. Corrosion was initiated and propagated by impressing a direct current to the tensile steel The specimens Vlere then tested at various levels of corrosion. The results from these tests are used to study the changes in flexural behaviour of corroded reinforced concrete (Rq beams with increasing corrosion.

5.2 Test Specimens 5.2.1 Beam Test Study
To study the relationship betVleen corrosion and flexural strength, a total of rv;elve beam specimens (BS) Vlere constructed, the dimensions of "'Which are shown in Figure 5-1. These specimens had a cross-section of 156 x 176 mm and a clear span of 1000 mm. The concrete cover of the stirrups

was 30 mm. All tV/elve beams had ThO No. 15 reinforcing bars at

the bOllom and two No. 10 bars at the top with 6 mm double-leg stirrups along the shear span at 40 mm spacing.

5.2.2 Pullout Tests Study
In order to correlate the residual strength of the reinforced concrete beams to residual bond strength, 12 pullout specimens (PS) were constructed It is possible to obtain a close estimate of the ultimate bond stress of the tensile steel using a mathematical model fOl.ll1d in the literature. I-fuwever, this pullout study "WaS conducted using the same materials and exposure conditions as in the beam study in order to establish the relationship more accurately. The details of the pullout specimens are shown in Figure 5-4. Each specimen had a preweighed No. 15 steel bar embedded in a concrete cylinder having a diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm The tensile force applied to the reinforcing steel and the area of the embedded length of the bar are used to calculate the average ultimate bond stress

5.3 Material Properties
5.3.1 Reinforcing Steel
All defonned reinforcements used for the construction of the beam and pullout specimens were obtained locally and confonned to the C3A Standard G30.18. All of the steel bars were defonned with the exception of the 6 rnm stirrups, which were plain. These stirrups were selected for the shear reinforcement due to the small cross-section of the beam, as larger defonned bars vvould not meet the requirement for the minimum bend diameter. To detennine the mechanical properties of the 15M tensile reinforcing bars used for this study, tension tests were perfonned on six randomly selected bars. These tests returned an average experimental yield strength and ultimate strength of 550 and 691 MPa respectively.

5.3.2 Concrete
Throughout this experiment, C3A Type 10 or the AS1M Type I nonnal Portland cement was used The properties of the fine and coarse aggregates that were used are sununarized in Table 5-1 and Table 5-2. Due to the close spacing of the reinforcement, the course aggregate selected was pea gravel, having a nominal maximum size of 10 mm The aggregates and the cement used throughout this experiment were manufactw"ed and! or supplied by LaFarge Canada.

5.4 Mixing, Casting and Curing
The concrete mix used for every specimen was based on the mix design previously used by Yoon et al (2001). The properties of the concrete are summarized in Table 5-3. The weight proportion of the concrete mixture was 1 (cement): 2 (coarse aggregate): 2 (fine aggregate): 0.5 (water), giving a water to cement ratio (wi c) of 0.5. The concrete was mixed in the laboratory using a 4 cubic foot portable electric mixer. The dry constituents of the concrete were mixed for 3 minutes, followed by the addition of water over a 2-minute period, and then mixed for another 3 minutes after the water was added

The \.\Qrkability of the concrete was very high with a slump of 200 rom and an air content of 2.5 %. The properties of hardened concrete were studied by perfonning 28-day tests, the average 28-day compressive strength and splitting tensile strength were tested to be 39 and 3.2 MPa respectively. Specifically, compressive strength tests in accordance with AS1M 09 and indirect tensile strength tests in accordance with AS1M C496 were done on cylinders having a diameter and height of 100 rom and 200 mm respectively. The splitting tensile strength was calculated by Equation 5-2 where,

For the beam specimens, the concrete -was cast horizontally in wooden moulds and compacted using an electric poker vibrator. The pullout specimens were cast vertically in plastic moulds and compacted using a vibrating table. After casting, the test specimens remained in their respective moulds and -were placed in a moist curing room at 23 ±2 degrees Celsius and 100% relative humidity. The specimens were removed from their fonTIS after 48 hours and kept underthe same conditions for 80 days.

5.5 Corrosion Acceleration
After curing the specimens for 80 days, they were panially immersed in a 5% saltvlater solution (byweight). Subsequent to this, the specimens were subjected to accelerated galvanic corrosion by the impression of a direct current density of 3 mN cm2· In the case of the beam specimens, the applied current -was based on the surface area of the tensile reinforcing steel

As specimens 1 and 2 -were the control specimens, they-were not exposed to any accelerated
corroSIon.

5.5.1 Voltage Monitoring
Since the current used to corrode the beam and pullout specimens -was constant, the voltage had to be regulated to compensate for changes in the resistivity of the circuit. Corrosion of the specimens causes increased concrete cracking, which in tum results in a reduced resistance. Therefore, observing the fluctuations in voltage can be useful \\hen detennining initial cover cracking, analysing the deterioration process, or comparing the corrosion of

It should be noted that other methods

to

define targeted levels of corrosion have been

successfully used in previous studies. A common method employed is based on Faraday's Law, 'Which prescnbes the relationship between the mass of iron consumed (Ms) and the am01111t of current (lwri), 'Which is passed through the corrosion cell. Faraday's Law is shown in Equation 5-3 where, A is the atomic weight of the ion being dissolved [g/mol1 F is Faraday's constant and equals 96500 Clmo~ and n is the valence of the reaction and is usually taken as 2. In the case of iron (Fe), the atomic weight is 55.85 g/mol (Higgins et ai, 2003).

5.5.3 Experimental Setup for Accelerated Corrosion

5.5.3.1 Beam Specimens
Each beam specimen was corroded simultaneously-with its corresponding pullout specimen using an accelerated galvanic method Ken'M)od PAC30-3R regulated DC (direct current) power supplies -with a maximum output of 3 amperes (A) at 30 volts (V) were used A separate power supply was used for each length of tensile reinforcement to accuratelycomrol and monitor the current passing through each bar. The two power supplies were integrated by a steel mesh at the bottom of the tank, 'Which served as the common ground The positive terminals on each power supply were connected reinforcing steel. The components of the system included a plastic tank, electrolyte solution, a steel mesh at the bottom of the tank (cathode), and the reinforcing steel (anode). The electrolyte solution
to

either the right (R) or the left (L)

51

was comprised of 5% de-icing salt (sodiwn chloride) by the weight of "Water and was changed

every 48 hours to maintain a constant pH and NaG concentration

It is imponant to note that although precautions were taken to prevent corrosion in the
stirrups, it was later f01Uld that the corrosion setup initially employed produced this very effect. Consequently, a second setup was opted for that split the specimens into categories of series I and series II. Series I is comprised of beam specimens BS03, BS04, BS05, and BS06, and series II of BS07, BS08, BS09, BS 10, BS 11, and BS 12. For series I, the beams were placed in the tank with the top face-up and the electrolyte solution just above the height of the bottom bars so that the beams were almost fully submerged For series II, the beams were about half submerged to just above the height of the tensile reinforcement with the bottom face down. Figures 5-6 and 5-7 each show a representative cross-section illustrating one side of the electrical system used for series I and II beam specimens respectively.

5.6 Methods of Testing
Following the accelerated corrosion stage, visual observations were perfonned to gain an overview of the degree of damage to each specimen Crack maps were drawn for each beam specimen indicating the length and location of each corrosion crack in order to categorize the level of deterioration. Non-destructive tests were perfonned to investigate the internal state of deterioration of each specimen. These tests include the ultrasonic pulse velocity and half-cell potential (i.e. corrosion potential) tests. Thereafter, the beams were loaded in four-point bending until failure and the mid-span deflections were measured The flexural and failure cracks were mapped in order to study the changes in the failure mode and flexural crack development. Finally, the specimens were broken open to retrieve the reinforcing steel and the mass loss
was determined

5.6.1 Visual Survey
The first stage in any condition assessrnentis generally a visual survey, \\hich is a valuable method of determining the nature of the deterioration. This type of survey can aid in identifying areas that require funher testing and! or a more detailed analysis. In this laboratory experiment, the deterioration is deliberately caused and is clearly the corrosion of the reinforcing steel As a result, this stage serves not to investigate the cause of the deterioration, but to monitor and document its extent.

54

A visual survey for all specimens was conducted before, during, and after the corrosion stage and any defects or cracks -were noted before the specimens entered the corrosion tank. During corrosion, a visual inspection was perlonned every 48 hours lUltil the desired level of corrosion was obtained

Convsion Cr.lck Survey

Following this stage, the specimens -were visually inspected and a detailed crack survey was perlonned on the beam specimens. The crack survey entailed the recording and plotting of all corrosion cracks. TIlls task was perlonned by tracing a scaled digital image using AutoCAD.

5.6.2 Non-Destructive Testing
Ultrasonic pulse velocity and half-cell potential tests -were perlonned prior to mechanical testing.

5.6.2.1

Ultr:lsonic Pulse Velocity Method

The ultrasonic pulse velocity method is described in AS1M C 597-02 and indicates the state of deterioration by detecting changes in concrete, such as internal cracking and other defects. The pulse velocity method rests on the premise that the velocity of a pulse of compressional waves passing through a medium is dependant upon the elastic properties and density of the medium, as shown in Equation 5-4 below.

(f...t) it takes the wave to pass through the concrete. The velocity (V) of the compressional
wave is shown in Equation 5-5 (Malhotra and Carino, 2004).

Equation 5-5

There are three possible arrangements in which the transducers may be placed (see Figure

5-10). These configurations are (A) direct, (B) semi direct, and

(0

indirect. The direct

transmission positioning was the arrangement used in this experiment. This is the most desirable configuration in that it transmits the rnaximtUll amount of energy to the receiving transducer (Malhotra and Carino, 2004).

As the velocity of the compressional waves is affected by the matter through \\hich it passes,
it is important when conducting this test that the waves only be affected by the subject concrete. Effects that alter the pulse velocity relating to concrete characteristics include aggregate size, grading, type, and content; cement type; water-cement ratio; admixtures; and the age of the concrete. However, there also exist other factors that are unrelated to concrete characteristics, such as the quality of the transducer contact; temperature, moisture and curing conditions of the concrete; path length; size and shape of the specimen; level of stress in the specimen; and the presence of reinforcing steel (Malhotra and Carino, 2004).

Ultrasonic pulse velocity readings were taken on all of the beam specimens. After the beams were removed from the corrosion tanks, they were allowed a minimum of one week to air-

dry before this test was performed. Due to the high concentration of reinforcing steel, only
tw) pulse velocity readings were taken in the centre of each beam: one horiwntallyand one vertically (see Figure 5-11). 1bis test was not performed on the pullout specimens due to their cylindrical shape and the location of the reinforcing steel

5.6.2.2 Half-ceO Potential Test
AS1M C876-91 describes the standard test method for measuring half-cell potentials of uncoated reinforcing steel in concrete. The half-cell potential test assesses the possible extent of the corrosion activity of the reinforcing steel embedded in the concrete. Figure 5-12 illustrates the Daniell cell, "Which can be used to understand the chemistry behind the half-cell potential test. This cell is composed of two half-cells: zinc in zinc sulphate and copper in copper sulphate. In each half-cell, the metal is dissolved and ions are precipitated, with the copper being more resistant to this reaction than the zinc. When the two cells are connected by a porous panition5 and the metals are connected by a wire, the copper from the copper sulphate solution is deposited on the copper electrode and the zinc dissolves (Broomfield, 1997).

Figure 5- U: The Daniel cell (Brooniie1d, 1997).

The vokage of a cell is detennined by the metals used and by the properties and composition of the solutions. The concentration of the solution is also a factor in detennining the potential of half-cells. Generally, a more concentrated solution is more corrosive than a diluted solution. Therefore, a cell comprised of a single metal in a solution of different concentrations will produce current potential. Table 5-41ists the standard6 half-cell potentials that are commonly used to evaluate corrosion problems. For instance, the cell vokage of the Daniell cell is equal to +0.34 minus -0.76 or +1.10 V (Broomfield, 1997).

The risk of corrosion can be measured by introducing an external half-cell on the surface of the concrete, as shown in Figure 5-13. If the half-cell is moved along the stee~ the measured potential will fluctuate, since the potential is dependant on the iron in its pore water environment. In anodic areas, iron can easily go into solution, much like the zinc in the Daniell cell. In cathodic areas, the steel resists dissolution. 1bis results in higher voltages in anodic areas and lower voltages in cathodic areas (Broomfield, 1997).

It is imponant to note that half-cell potentials are entirely a hmction of corrosion. Factors

that may affect half-cell potentials include concrete cover depth and resistivity, the availability of oxygen, water content (saturation), and carbonation.

For each test, the applied load was recorded using a data acquisition program.

RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PR(x;RAM
6.1 Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to report the results gathered from the accelerated corrosion process, non-destructive testing, destructive testing, and post-test examinations.

6.2 Corrosion Cell Configuration
An illlexpected complication that arose during this experiment -was illlwanted corrosion in
the shear reinforcement due to the initial electrochemical cell configuration. This -was discovered during the ongoing visual surveys of the beam specimens that \\ere conducted during the accelerated corrosion phase. As a result, the corrosion cell setup used for the beam specimens -was redesigned shortly after the corrosion phase started Figures 5-6 and 5-7 show t\\O different corrosion configurations; the fonner configuration had the beam almost fully submerged and inverted in the tank, while the latter had the beam in an upright position partially submerged to just above the height of the tensile steel The initial setup (series I) -was opted for in order to facilitate the daily visual surveys, the rationale being that the tensile portion of the beam would be more easily accessed by only having to slightly elevate it out of the salt solution HO\\ever, the corrosion of the stirrups necessitated the employment of series II, thus preventing the stirrups from becoming

65

submerged in the salt solution 1his required that the beams be completely removed from the tank and inverted 180 degrees to be monitored After the first t\m beams (BS03 and BS04) were corroded, the impending problem with the configuration of series I was not yet evident as the corrosion level was too low. When the second pair of beams (BS05 and BS06) nearly completed the corrosion phase, the occurrence of cracking and the accumulation of corrosion products in places other than in the area of the tensile reinforcement were observed

Figure 6-1: Photograph showing portion of BS06 (left face) after conus ion phase.

Figure 6-1 is a photograph of the left side of BS06 immediately after it was removed folhwing 126 hours in the accelerated corrosion tank. The top of the photo is where the left face meets the bottom face, while the bottom clearly sho"WS corrosion products in the compression zone of the beam, indicating the corrosion of either the top bars or the stirrups.

66

This phenomenon occurred despite the measures taken to electrically isolate the bottom bars
from the rest of the reinforcement cage. Based on the evidence observed and considering that electrons will take the path of least resistance, it can be hypothesized that while in the corrosion tank, current moved from the tensile reinforcement to the stirrups through the ionic medium When the electrons departed from the stirrups to move toward the cathode, they effectively became anodic and corrosion occurred This phenomenon is know as stray current corrosion and is most commonly associated with electric powered streetcars (Broomfield, 1997). In an attempt to correct this problem, the corrosion cell arrangement was changed to the setup depicted in Figure 5-7. The six remaining beams (BS07 to BS12) were corroded in this fashion, "With the beams placed in the tank "With the top face-up and the electrolyte solution just above the height of the bottom bars.

The visible damage to the exterior of these beams prior to the corrosion program suggested that the corrosion activity was more concentrated to the tensile region \\hen compared to the previous setup. Due to this change in the corrosion cell setup almost midway through the corrosion program, the corrosion stages were restarted and therefore, the maximum level of corrosion induced was far below \\hat had been anticipated

6.3 Accelerated Corrosion Monitoring
Corrosion was accelerated by impressing a current density of 3 mAl cm2, "With respect to the tensile reinforcement. This method of corrosion was employed to reach advanced stages of deterioration in a relatively shon time. The details of this corrosion program for the beam specimens are summarized in Table 6-1.

The average voltages for series I and series II corrosion cells are sho\VIl

in Figure 6-2 (refer to Figure 5-3 for the naming of the rebar). As mentioned earlier, each
rebar "WaS assigned its O\VIl power supply incOlporated by common ground for each beam The average voltages during the accelerated corrosion phase for series I and II beam specimens were approximately 17V and 27V respectively.

Ifill Series I IlIlIII Series II I
Figure 6-2: Average voltage readings for series I and II beam specinrns.

TIlls disparity in the voltage readings between series I and II specimens is due to the
increased electrical resistance of the series II circuit. Since only the tensile steel and the lovver ponion of the stirrups vvere submerged in the electrolyte solution, the area in -which the electron exchange process took place was reduced, making the movement of the electrons

through the circuit more difficult.
Figure 6-3 and Figure 6-4 plot the voltage readings taken during the accelerated corrosion phase for both series I and II. The general trend in Figure 6-3 (series I beams) show; that the voltage had undergone an initial increase -within the first 24 hours, which was follovved by a gradual decrease. Given that voltage is directly proponional to resistance -when current is

69

constant (ie. a decrease in resistance \\Quld require a reduction in voltage), it can be concluded that there was mounting electrical resistance initially, followed by a progressive reduction.

Figure 6-4 on the other hand, tells an incomplete story. Although this plot also sho\\8 a decreasing trend, the initial increase is absent. The reason for this difference in behaviour is that the power supplies used was limited to providing a maximum output of 31 volts, which is evident by the numerous readings at this threshold

nus capping of the voltage not only

eliminated the initial increasing trend that is clearly observed in Figure 6-3, but it also disabled some of the beams in series II from receiving the full 3 mN cm2 -within the first 96 hours.

Figure 6-4: Voltage readings forseries II beam specimens.

The six readings in Figure 6-4 that hover below the sample population are of BS10 and these uncharacteristically low voltages are due to faulty insulation of the electrical connection

within the electrolyte solution This resulted in a 'shott' of the electrical circuit and lowered
the voltage required to maintain a constant current flow. Figure 6-5 is a prime example of the diminishing of the current caused by the limitations of the pov.er supply. This graph sho\VS both the voltage and current readings with respect to

Figure 6-5: Voltage and ClJl'rent readings for BSll-L.

Both the increase in the voltage observed for series I and the reduction in the current observed for series II are due to the fluctuation of resistance in the system It is clear from these observations that there is an initial increase of resistance within the system, v.hich is followed by a decreasing trend 'This phenomenon can be aunbuted to the initial build up of corrosion products that occupy the pores of the concrete, thus blocking the movement of ions and increasing the electrical resistance. Eventuaily, the tensile stresses developed within the concrete caused by the expanding corrosion products crack the concrete, making a corridor for the transport of ions and escaping corrosion products, -which results in the subsiding of resistance.

72

The voltage readings from the pullout specimens show this trend more clearly, as seen in Figure 6-6. The reason for this clarity is that this type of specimen has only one rebar embedded within it and thus there are no resistance fluctuations due to stray current.

Figure 6-7: Evolution of cotrosioncrack width for series II beam specimens.

On the other hand, the crack -width measurements observed for series I specimens were quite
scanered, showing large residual errors \\hen linearly regressed This is due
to

the variability

of corrosion location and propagation inherent -with stray current corrosion. Nevertheless, a corrosion-crack expansion rate of approximately 2.4 ,urn/hr was estimated Since the current density applied to all of the beams was constant, the difference in the above rates can be explained in tenns of the area of steel corroded The entire reinforcing cage for series I was submerged in the electrolyte solution, and thus the area of the steel corroded was greater, vWich in turn reduced the rate of corrosion.

74

6.3.3 Corrosion Crack Survey
Following the removal of the beams from the corrosion tank, corrosion crack maps were

drawn. These maps are presented in Appendix B \\here they show the location and width in
mm for all visible surface corrosion cracks. For each figure, corrosion cracks are identified by a dotted line, and the beam faces illustrated (starting from the top) are right face, bottom face, and left face. An example corrosion crack survey is shown in Figure 6-8.

6.4 Non-Destructive Testing
Following the accelerated corrosion stage, the beam specimens were allowed to dry for one "Week before they "Were non-destructively tested The results of the half-cell potential and pulse velocity tests are presented below.

6.4.1 Half-Cell Potential Readings
Half-cell potential readings were taken every 100 mm along the tensile reinforcement on the bottom and the t\ID side faces of each beam specimen (as shown in Figure 5-14), giving a total of 44 readings per beam These readings for all t-welve beams are provided in Appendix C with an example shown in Figure 6-9. The half-cell potential readings are divided into seven categories, as shown in Table 6-2. These categories range from" A" to "G", 'Where" A" and "G" represent the highest and the lo"WeSt risk of corrosion respectively. This system of designation allowed for more contrast and clarity 'When analyzing the potential readings.

Interestingly, the half-cell potentials for those beams of series I and II that were exposed to the same current for approximately the same amount of time are noticeably different. Specifically, series I beams BS03 and BS04 were exposed to 46.75 hours of corrosion, we series II beams BS07 and BS08 were exposed to 44.75 hours of corrosion, and yet the latter showed a higher corrosion potential. Figure 6-11 and Figure 6-12 are frequency diagrams of the half-cell potential readings for these beams. Since all of the beams were identical and the impressed current was the same, it can be deduced that the different corrosion potentials are a direct result of the configuration of the corrosion setup. Figure 6-11 and Figure 6-12 illustrate that the potential for corrosion was much lower for series I, implying that the rate of corrosion was lower and supporting the notion of stray current occurrence.

6.4.2 Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity Readings
Table 6-4 provides the ultrasonic pulse velocity readings for each beam specimen, where the x-axis is the horizontal "Width and the y-axis is the vertical height (see Figure 5-11 for schematic of test locations). This method, which is described in AS1M C 597-02, provides an indication of the state of concrete deterioration by detecting changes in the concrete matrix such as internal cracking. The average pulse velocities for each beam with respect to corrosion time are swnrnarized in Figure 6-13. These results sho'Wed a difference bet'Ween the pulse velocities of series I and series II specimens. There was a reduction in the average pulse velocities for the series I beams, particularly in the case of specimens BS05 and BS06, which 'Were the most corroded This is due to the increased concrete cracking from the corrosion that was induced in both the stirrups and tensile reinforcement.

Figure 6-13: Average ultrasonic pulse velocities.

In contrast, while the pulse velocity readings of the series II beam specimens (BS07 to BS 12) were all reduced when compared to the control beams, there was no decreasing trend with increasing corrosion time as with series I. TIlls can be explained by the fact that the series II beams had considerably more chlorides deposited above the water line, where the pulse velocities were measured Since salt is hydroscopic, it can be speculated that the local

80

moisture content was slightly higher, causing an increase in the pulse velocity and a longer corrosion time resulted in the accumulation of more salt.

6.5 Beam Tests
After the non-destructive testing was completed, the beams were loaded in four-point bending illltil failure (see Figure 5-15 for set-up details) and the corresponding load and midspan deflections were measured
It is very important to note that the frame used to test the beam specimens proved defective

midway through the experiment, requiring that the test be relocated to a second frame for the remaining beams. The problem resulted from the buckling of the I-beam above the hydraulic piston used to apply the load, which skewed the direction of the load This misalignment of the load was discovered after the control specimen BS02 failed in shear (as shown by the flexural crack survey in Appendix F), which prompted an investigation into the behaviour. It was fOillld that the applied load was slightly rotated towards the front face and the misalignment got progressively worse with increasing load Due to this discovery, the results of the beams tested illlder these conditions were deemed as compromised and illlreliable. Consequently, the beam test results of BS02 and all of the series I beams (BS03 to BS06) have been excluded from the report and will not be discussed in the analysis section.
6.5.1 Load-Carrying Capacity

Table 6-5 summarizes the results of the beam tests that are discussed in this report. This table lists the ultimate load (P) that each beam was able to support, along with the

81

corresponding relative capacity, initial cracking load, and deflection capacity (or mid-span deflection). In this study, a decrease in deflection capacity is regarded as an indication of reduced ductility.

As expected, the beam tests show a reduction in both the load-carrying capacity and the
deflection capacity with this increase in corrosion level. TIlls is due to the known effects of reductions in steel-concrete bond, reinforcing steel cross-sectional area, and concrete contribution.

6.5.2 Load- Deflection Behaviour
Load-deflection curves (IDG) reveal much information concerning the behaviour of RC beams and they are notably altered with the progression of corrosion. As predicted, results show that a higher corrosion level results in decreased stiffness, increased deflection and reduced ultimate load The ultimate deflections, however, were reduced with increasing corrosion. These phenomena are a result of the combination of the deteriorated bond between the steel and the concrete, the reduction in the cross-sectional area of the reinforcing steel, and the cracking and delamination of the concrete.

82

The load-deflection curves for BS01 and BS07 to BS12 are depicted in Figure 6-14. These load-deflection plots are generalized, showing the linear trend until the yielding of the tensile steel in the case for BS01 or failure for all of the corroded bearns. The slope of the IDC before failure or the yielding of the reinforcing steel can indicate the stiffness of RC bearns, -while the area under the IDC can indicate the toughness or absorbed energy. The calculated slopes and areas of the above IDa are summarized in Table 6-6. The slope of a line is given by m, when the equation of a line is in the slope-intercept form
(y = mx + b). The slope of the IDa was detennined by m of the equation of the straight-

line portion of each IDe, in the section of the curve before the yielding of the reinforcing steel or the collapse of the beam, whichever came first. The area under the IDC was obtained by finding the definite integral of the best fitting trend line(s) of the IDG Appendix D shows the trend lines of the IDa for beam specimens BS01 and BS07 to BS12. These plots also give the equations of the trend lines and the deflection values used to calculate the area under the curve. The slope of the IDe, the area under the IDC and the deflection capacity all decrease with increased corrosion intensity, implying a reduction in the stiffness, toughness and ductility. These reductions suggest a rise in brittleness, which is precisely what was observed during the beam tests perlonned for this study.

.As corrosion increased, the failure mode of the beams shifted from predictable ductile

flexure failures at mid-span, to more brittle bond-shear failures near the suppon. Severely corroded beams displayed extremely briule failures at the suppon, with no forewarning and only one primary fracture line. Photographs of the failure zone of each beam specimen were taken immediately after the beam tests and are shown in Appendix E. Figure E-1 depicts the failure zone for the control beam BS01, v.hich experienced a balanced flexural failure with yielding of the reinforcement and crushing of the concrete. Figure E-2 illustrates the failure zone for the control beam BS02, v.hich experienced an unexpected shear failure due to a faulty test frame that transferred a disproportionate load to one side of the beam. The pictures in Figure E-3 to Figure E-6 ponray the failure zones for series I beam specimens BS03 to BS06. Although these beams were all tested in the faulty test frame and thus their results have been excluded, the photographs are still presented since they show an evolution of the failure mode. Series II beam specimens BS07 to BS 12, on the other hand, experienced no such complications during beam testing and their results are discussed in the analysis section. The failure zones for these beams are pictured in Figure E-7 to Figure E-12.

6.6 Post-Test Examinations
Following the completion of the beam tests, a second crack survey was conducted and the actual mass loss of the reinforcing steel due to corrosion was detennined

6.6.1 Flexural Crack Survey
'While the first crack survey documented corrosion cracks that resulted from the accelerated
corrosion stage, this second survey recorded flexural cracks that developed due to the mechanical testing. These flexural crack maps are provided iIi Appendix F, and Figure 6-16 is an example. The faces illustrated in these crack maps (staning from the top) are right, bottom, and left. Therefore, according to the convention outlined in Figure 5-2, the edge on the left hand side of the representations is the front face; this is \\here the electrical connection was made. The numbers on the right face indicate the maximum width of each flexural crack before failure. Figure F-1 is a legend distinguishing each crack type .

The crack survey discussed above -was used to study flexural crack development. Specifically, the average number and the average spacing of transverse flexural cracks \\ere both considered For example, in Figure 6-17 showing the right face of BS 11, there are four flexural cracks and the average crack spacing in millimetres is equal to: (132+89+140)/3. This procedure -was carried out for both the left and right faces of each beam, referencing the cracks from the bottom edge of these faces bet\\een the supports.

The type of corrosion fOillld in the more severely corroded bars can be classified as generalized It Vv'aS observed that corrosion of the steel typically started with the fonnation of pits that increased in number and expanded illltil they eventually connected, resulting in generalized corrosion. This progression of rebar deterioration is depicted in Figure 6-18. According to Broomfield (1997), this sequence is characteristic of reinforcing bars exposed to carbonation or chlorides.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

7.1 Introduction
This chapter qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the results from the experimental

program and focuses on the manner in which progressive corrosion affects reinforced concrete (RQ beams. Specifically, the changes in flexural crack development, mode of failure, stiffness, ductility, toughness, and load-carrying capacity of RC beams are examined

7.2 Analysis of Half-Cell Potentials
As the half-cell potential test is a qualitative test that indicates the probability of corrosion of

the reinforcing steel embedded within the concrete, caution must be exercised when using absolute potential values quantitatively. In fact, several studies have shown that numerous variables can alter absolute half-cell potential values, while keeping the degree of corrosion at the steel sutface constant and thus quantitative interpretation based on absolute potential values can be misleading (RILEM TC 154-EMC 2003; Grimaldi et al., 1986). Nevertheless, Sarveswaran
et

al. (2000) used half-cell potentials to develop an empirical

relationship for the prediction of section loss in RC beams due to the corrosion of both the main reinforcement bars and the shear links. This empirical relationship 'WaS used as part of a methodology to assess the reliabilityof deteriorated RC beams.

95

In light of this, -MUle the half-cell potential measurements obtained in this study are not given undue emphasis, they are included in this discussion due to the remarkable correlations found That is, the average half-cell potentials of the beam specimens related vety -well to both the total mass loss and the relative beam capacity.

Adminedly, Equation 7-1 and Equation 7-2 are quantitative interpretations based on qualitative results. As mentioned previously, half-cell potential readings may be misleading and an over-reliance on them to make anysolt of predictions can be risky. However, half-cell

97

potentials can be used in conjllllction with other tests and data as part of a systematic probabilistic assessment program.

7.3 Effect of Corrosion on Initial Cracking Load
In the literature reviewed, the effect of corrosion on the initial cracking load is not frequently addressed However, tv.u recent papers did arrive at contrasting conclusions concerning this effect. While Maaddawy et al (2005) argued that corrosion has almost no effect on the cracking load, Fan et al. (2004) proposed that the cracking load decreased sharply with mcreasmg corroSIon.

Figure 7-3: Effect of cOl1'Osion on the initial cracking load

The findings of the present study do not support either of the above ideas; it was observed that the initial cracking load decreased at low levels of corrosion and remained constant, v;ith
98

a final increase at a mass loss of approximately 10%. Figure 7-3 shows the observed initial cracking loads and the corresponrung total mass loss for each beam The initial cracking load for the control beam was recorded at P = 35 kN. The lowest stage of corrosion yielded a mass loss of 0.89% and at this leveL the initial cracking load decreased slightly to P
=

30 kN. The first cracking load remained constant at 30 kN until the mass loss

reached 10.25%, ~ere it exceeded the original cracking load at P = 40 kN. The decrease in the initial cracking load at lower levels of corrosion is likely due to internal corrosion cracks and micro-cracks that have weakened the concrete matrix, thus lowering the initial cracking load Although the occurrence and severity of these internal cracks increases as corrosion progresses, the initial cracking load does not decrease due to the loss in concrete-steel bond strength. As bond strength is reduced and internal cracking is increased, the forces transferred from the reinforcement to the encircling concrete are diminished and thus the initial cracking load is increased at higher levels of corrosion.

7.4 Effect of Corrosion on Crack Development
A key characteristic of bond performance is its influence on crack development. The tensile concrete between the flexural cracks is largely responsible for the balancing of tensile stresses
within the beam (Castel et ai, 2000b). This phenomenon is known as tension stiffening. As

corrosion propagates, there are reductions in bond strength and tension stiffening due to cover cracking and delamination (Coronelli and Garnbrova, 2004).

Average Number of Transverse Cracks

Figure 7-4: The relationship between the average nurnberof transverse cracks and the average crack spacing.

Amleh and Mirza (1999) fOlllld that the association bet--ween a decrease in the tension stiffening and an increase in the corrosion level signifies the initiation of bond breakdown, which is highly influenced by the surlace conditions of the bar and the level of its adhesion and cohesion to the surrollllding concrete. In tenns of flexure or transverse cracks, it is evident that with higher levels of corrosion, there is an increase in crack spacing and a decrease in the average number of cracks, as shown in Figure 7-4. These observations of decreased crack numbers are consistent with the findings of Amleh (2000), who studied tension specimens 7 · The author attributed the fe--wer transverse cracks in corroded specimens relative to the control specimens to the effect of loss of bond strength and! or internal cracking of the concrete Surrollllding the steel bars. As

bond strength is reduced and intemal cracking is increased, the forces transferred from the reinforcement to the encircling concrete are diminished (Amleh, 2000). It was also noted that, "In order to form a new crack between tv.o existing cracks, the tensile force which causes cracking of the concrete should be introduced into the concrete by this bond at the steel-concrete interface" (Amleh, 2000). On the other hand, while Amleh (2000) observed an increase in maximum crack -widths as corrosion progresses, this was not exhibited by the specimens tested for this study. Granted, the testing of tension specimens is an excellent method of studying both bond behaviour and the mechanics that occur in the tension face of RC beams experiencing pure flexure. However, at high leve1s of corrosion, their behaviour can only be applied to RC beams that can produce like steel stresses in the reinforcing steel Conditions that support the transfer of stresses from the concrete to the steel include the state of the SurrOlUlding concrete, adequate anchorage, and sufficient development length. It is likely that for the beam specimens tested for this study, these conditions were lost due to the corrosion of the tensile steel The reason that corroded tension specimens produce -wider cracks at high leve1s of corrosion is that the embedded rebar is mechanically tensioned, thus directly stressing the steel Conversely, in the case for loaded beams, the forces must be transferred to the tensile steel in order to produce these stresses. After testing RC beams -with un-bonded tensile bars at the shear span having adequate anchoring at their ends, Nokhasteh and Eyre (1992) observed fewer, but wider flexural cracks. This behaviour was also exhibited by the severely corroded beams tested by Rodriguez et al (1997), particularly beam type 11. This beam had a cross-section of 150 x 200 mm, which is similar to those tested for this study, but -with t"Wice the development
101

length. The former case had adequate anchorage, mereas the latter had sufficient development length, both of mich are required for the transfer of stresses to the steel, as stated above. Therefore, the fact that the beams tested in this study did not experience wider flexural cracks at severe corrosion levels suggests a loss of anchorage, mich prevented the transfer of the forces required to introduce and widen cracks. In tenns of bond mechanics, the interlocking that occurs betv.een the bar ribs and concrete keys was deteriorated as corrosion levels increased and slippage of the rebar occurred

7.5 Widening of Flexural Cracks
Coronelli and Gambarova (2004) modelled beam type 11 from the above-mentioned study by Rodriguez et aL (1997), and proposed that arch action (mich is indicative of wider flexural cracks) was activated men the tensile steel suffered complete bond loss along the mid-span mile being well anchored at the ends by tv.o mechanisms. The first of these mechanisms was support-induced confinement and the second was the compression of the concrete in the tension face near the support. The notion of the latter mechanism was taken from Cairns and Zhao (1993), who observed this phenomenon men studying RC beams -with anchored ends but exposed tensile steel in the mid-span. The following data analysis is provided in an attempt to make a comparison between beam
type 11 and those in

this study, with respect to support-induced confinement. The most

corroded type 11 beam (# 116) suffered a mass loss of roughly 26% and the reaction at each support was 11.9 kN, mereas the most deteriorated beam in this study (BS11) had a mass loss of 11.56% and the reaction at each support was 48.2 kN. These numbers indicate that

102

beam # 116 had roughly 2.2 times the corrosion, while BS 11 had reactions that were 4 times larger. As the width of the beams is comparable8 and the compressive strength of the concrete is si.rnilar, the other factor to consider when comparing confinement pressure is bar size. Beam
type 11 had nvo 10 mm bars and the beams tested for this study had nvo 16 mm bars, giving

a size ratio of 1.6 and an area ratio of 2.56 (ie. 1.6~. 1his means that for every kN at the support, 10 mm bars experience 2.56 times the confinement pressure as 16 mm bars. Assuming that the reactions at the support are directly proportional to the confining pressure (1:1), BS11 experienced 1.58 times (ie. 48.2/[2.56>(°11.9] the pressure of beam # 116. Considering all of the above, the question arises as to why the beams tested by Rodriguez et al. (1997) produced wider flexural cracks as corrosion progressed, while those tested for this study did not. In other "'WOrds, why did beam BS11, which had half the corrosion and 1.58 times the confining pressure of # 116, fail to experience wider flexural cracks? One possible explanation is that this failure is due to the difference in reinforcement ratio, since beam # 116 had a ratio of 0.52%, while BS11 had a ratio of 1.46%. However, Rodriguez et al. (1997) tested beams with reinforcement ratios ranging from 0.52 % to 1.51 % and observed wider cracks in all cases. Since the reinforcement ratio of the beams tested in

this study was less than 1.51%, and they did not produce wider flexural cracks, it is clear that
it is not the determining factor in this case. The difference in beam span is another possible reason for the lack of wider flexural cracks

in the beams tested for this study, as it was half that of the beams tested by Rodriguez et al.

103

(1997). A longer span causes three main effects. The first is that a beam with a longer span

deflects more than one with a shoner span and a greater deflection means wider cracks. The second effect is a longer development length, which increases the area in which the transfer of stresses from the concrete to the steel takes place. The problem with these two factors is that in both cases, sufficient bond is required to cause the widening of cracks, and yet Coronelli and Garnbarova (2004) claimed a complete loss of bond between the supports of beam type 11. The third effect and most plausible explanation for these cracks is that the greater shear span of beam type 11 allowed for a longer length of concrete in the tension face to shift into compression, as in the research byCaims and Zhao (1993). When the concrete surrounding the bars in the shear span is in compression, the confinement of the bars is enhanced and the bond stress is improved
F rom this reasoning, it can be concluded that for the beams tested by Rodriguez et al (1997),

the widening of flexural cracks has more to do with the length of the shear span than with suppon-induced confinement and reinforcement ratio. Moreover, the (1.58 times) greater confining pressure and the considerably less corrosion of the beams tested in this study implies that the bar ends were well anchored allowing for arch action, albeit flexural cracks never widened.

7.6 Evolution of Failure Mode
The failure mode of undamaged RC beams depends upon the reinforcing ratio. Lightly reinforced beams fail in a ductile manner by the yielding of the reinforcement prior to the crushing of concrete, while moderately reinforced beams may fail by the crushing of concrete

104

"With adequate ductility. The failure of over-reinforced RC beams is by the crushing of concrete, which precedes the yielding of the reinforcement. It is clear from the literature that the failure mode of RC beams tends to change after corrosion due to the loss of both concrete and steel sections and the decay of the concretesteel bond For instance, Rodriguez et al (1997) found that un-corroded beams that are designed to fail by bending actua1lytend to fail by shear when corroded In addition, Wang et al (2000) reported that as corrosion increased, the failure mode shifted from shear to bond splitting, "With the longitudinal reinforcement pulled out. In contrast, Capozucca and Cerri (2003) investigated the influence of corrosion on the compressive zone and found that while un-corroded beams failed by the yielding of the tensile reinforcement, corroded beams failed by the crushing of the concrete and had "Wider flexural cracks. These researchers also concluded that corrosion damage to reinforcement in the compressive zone results in a reduction in the compressive strength of the concrete in the direction along the bar. In the case for simply supported beams "With high bond deterioration, Coronelli and Gambarova (2004) proposed tw) possible failure scenarios. The first failure mode is a bond failure located close to flexural cracks that is accompanied by excessive slip and highlocalized bond stresses. Plizzari et al. (1996) suggested that these bond stresses may cause concrete splitting along the bar, where the radial splitting cracks propagate throughout the cover until bond failure occurs. The second mode is an anchorage failure of the tensile reinforcing steel Using their reliability theory, Sarveswaran et al (2000) demonstrated that

this type of failure is the most critical

1

105

Although the beams tested for the present study were simply supported and were deemed in section 7.4 to have high bond deterioration, the failure modes did not confonn to either of the tv.o scenarios mentioned above. Specifically, after the onset of corrosion, there was a shift from predictable and ductile flexure failures at mid-span, to more brittle bond-shear failures near the support -with the failure crack inclined at approximately 45 degrees (from the horizontal). As corrosion progressed, both the brittleness and the angle of the failure crack increased Severely corroded beams displayed extremely brittle failures at the support, "With no forewarning and only one primary failure crack, v.hich was nearly vertical (Figure 7-5).

Figure 7-8: Illustration showing crack survey of BS12 (ML = 10.25%).

Figure 7-6 shows the crack sunrey for BS01, a control specimen that was not exposed to any accelerated corrosion. 1bis beam had an ultimate capacity of 140.25 kN and its failure was as expected: balanced with the yielding of the tensile steel and the crushing of concrete. The average number of flexural cracks and their spacing was measured at 10 and 72.4 nnn res pectively. 1bis predicted type of failure was considerably altered vAlen the RC beam specimens \\'ere even slightly corroded, as seen in Figure 7-7 showing the crack sunrey for BS07. 1bis beam suffered a total mass loss (ML) of 2.45% and consequently, the ductile flexure failure of the control beam shifted from the centre towards a more brittle bond-shear failure near the support and was ultimately only able to carry 83.7% of the average control load. Flirthennore, the flexural cracking pattern changed so that the average number of cracks dropped 45% and the average crack spacing increased bya factor of 1.90.

108

As corrosion increased, this shift in behaviour became more pronOlUlced For instance, the failure of BS 12
V1clS

extremely brittle and occurred abruptly at the support, with only one

primary fracture line. This beam had the second highest level of corrosion with a total :ML of 10.25% and was able to carry 68.5% of the control load The cracking pattern for BS 12 also changed dramatically, as sho\VJl in Figure 7-8, with the number of flexure cracks decreasing by 65% and the average crack space increasing by a factor of 2.34. The res ults of this experiment as 'Well as the literature revie'Wed clearly indicate a dramatic shift in the nature of the failure of corroded RC beams. HO'Wever, due to the many inbuilt differences in beams (e.g. the layout and ratio of reinforcement, size and placement of stirrups, intensity and location of corrosion, slenderness, and span), predicting the nature of the failure that a corroded beam will experience is an area that requires further research.

7.7 Effect of Stimtp Corrosion
The purpose of the stirrups in the present study is to ensure that the shear strength of a beam equals or exceeds its flexural strength. Likewise, the beam specimens had extra shear reinforcement, which ensured a flexural failure of the control beam and prevented a shear failure of any of the corroded ones. Although the stirrups did fulfil their function, they corroded in spite of the precautions taken. The effects of stirrup corrosion include the 'Weakening of the surrounding concrete by microcracking, and the cracking and delamination of the concrete cover, both of which 'Were observed in this study. The latter effect lessened the effective depth and width of the concrete in the shear span of the beams.

Figure 7-9 displays the failure zone of BS07, a beam with a corrosion level of 2.45%, and demonstrates how the concrete split into separate layers. The photo on the left show-> the complete failure zone and provides the context for the enlargement photo on the right. The white arrow in this photo points to one of the stirrups that was exposed after the beam collapsed and the areas darkened by corrosion products signify corrosion. In addition, the rust staining on the concrete between the stirrups confinns that the concrete between each of the stirrups was cracked in the plane of the stirrups belowthe cover.

Although the crack survey of BS12 (Figure 7-8) recorded two vertical flexural cracks at the supports, the failure crack coincided with a vertical corrosion crack that was likely caused by the corrosion of the end stirrup. This indicates that the corrosion of the stirrups may have determined the location of the failure. Figure 7-10 is a photograph of this area, illustrating that the failure crack coincided with the rust stained corrosion crack

7.8 Effect of Corrosion on Deflection Ratio
Many researchers, including Dekoster et al. (2003) and Maaddawy et al. (2005), concur that there is a significant increase in mid-span deflections with increasing corrosion. Similarly, Ballim et ai (2001) found that for beams simultaneously subjected to load and accelerated corrosion, time-dependant deflections increase with greater corrosion.

I

The rise in mid-span deflections can be explained by a loss of bond between the tensile steel and the surrounding concrete. When bond strength is reduced, tensile stresses in the re-bars are significantly increased (Castel et ai, 2000b). Indeed, Castel et al. (2000b) and Cabrera

1

111

(1996) both attributed the mcrease of in-semce mid-span deflections to loss in bond strength. Cabrera (1996), who developed a numerical relationship between deflection ratidO and corrosion, reponed that -Mien the corrosion level reached 9%, beam deflections increased by 1.5 times that of the non-corroded beam Similarly, the present study fOlllld that at a corrosion level of 10.25%, beam deflections increased by a factor of 1.54 times. The distribution of the results obtained by this study, however, was quite different. As shown in Figure 7-11 the deflection ratio that was attained from the findings of the present study is a logarithmic increase in the deflection ratio, while the deflection ratio that was observed by Cabrera (1996) is a simple linear relationship. The trend fOlllld in this study is very similar to that observed by Ballim and Reid (2003), -Mio reponed that deflections increased as corrosion propagated, with the largest increase near the early stages of corrosion. Equation 7- 3 is the numerical expression established by way of logarithmic regressIon analysis 1\ -Miere Dr is the deflection ratio, ML is the total percent mass loss, and 1" is the coefficient of determination.

7.9 Effect of Corrosion on Ductility
The rise in corrosion intensity not only causes mid-span deflections to increase, but also causes deflection capacities 12 to decrease significantly. This notion of the reduction in deflection capacity is substantiated by a number of researchers, including Dekoster et al (2003) and Maaddawy et al (2005). In this study, deflection capacity is regarded as an indication of ductility or flexibility. Coronelli and Garnbrova (2004) stated that changes in the ductility of concrete beams are caused by the notch effect of pitting corrosion of the tensile steel bars. As the cross-section of the steel bars is diminished, ductility is reduced Castel et al (2000b) postulated that this

Deflection capacity is the deflection corresponding to the ultimate load.

113

loss in ductility appears to be controlled by the mere presence of the notch rather than its depth. Castel et

at

(2000b) concluded that as corrosion increases, the ductility of RC beams

decreases exponentially and then stabilizes at a loss of approximately 75% of the original. The results from the present study are consistent Vv'ith this finding, shoVJ.ing a very similar trend Vv'ith an exponential decrease and stabilization at around 70% of the original ductility. Figure 7-12 graphs the observed relationship between steel mass loss and the relative deflection capacity and Equation 7-4 is the numerical relationship obtained by power regression analysis 13 , where Dc is the relative ductility, ML is the total percent mass loss, and

7.10 Effect of Corrosion on Stiffness
Corrosion also has an effect on stiffness, which is related to deflection In fact, several researchers have reported a marked reduction in the stiffness of corroded beams (Perno et al., 2005; Dekoster et al., 2003; Castel et al., 2000b). On the other hand, Maaddawy et al. (2005) found that the stiffness of beams that are corroded under sustained loading is higher than that of virgin beams when loaded to failure. Castel et al. (2000a) found that the loss of beam stiffness is attributed to a decrease in strengths of both the rebar cross-sectional area and the local steel-concrete bond of the tensile bars. A reduction in the stiffness of a beam is also caused by the formation of cracks, as reported byOlung et al. (2004) and Yoon et al. (2000).
As mentioned earlier, bond breakdown is related to concrete cracking, both of which cause a

decrease in tension stiffening. Considering this, it follows that stiffness decay is due to impaired tension stiffening (Coronelli and Gambarova, 2004). Based·on the findings of the research discussed, it can be concluded that changes in stiffness occur whenever there is a redistribution of internal stresses. The slope of the load-deflection curve (IDq can be used to indicate the stiffness of an element, as in the W)rk by Huang and Yang (1997). In the present study, a relationship between the stiffness and the total percent mass loss (ML) of RC beams -was derived from the findings of the experimental program, as shown in Figure 7-13. This figure demonstrates that as corrosion increases, stiffness decreases exponentially and then stabilizes at a loss of

7.11 Effect of Corrosion on Toughness
Toughness, which is related to stiffness and ductility, is another measurable characteristic of RC beams. The toughness of a material is defined as the energy absorbed per unit volume, and is measured by the area lUlder the stress-strain curve up to fracture. A ductile fracture occurs when a material experiences appreciable plastic defonnation and energy absorption
14 Since zero raised to the power of a negative number is not possible, the regression analysis was conducted with the ML of the control beam taken as 0.0001.

prior to fracture. Q)llversely, a brittle fracture results when a material experiences little or no energyabsotption prior to fracture ~llston and Domone, 2001). The area tmder the IDC up to failure has been used to assess the absorbed energy of RC beams (ie. toughness), as in the research by Uomoto and Misra (1988) and Azher (2005). Although the literature reviewed contains limited infonnation concerning the manner in which corrosion affects the area tmder the IDC of RC beams, it is established that toughness
is typically reduced with increasing corrosion (Azher, 2005).

Using data from the experiment conducted for the purpose of this study, a relationship between toughness and the level of corrosion was established, as seen in Figure 7-14. The data acquired reveals a trend similar to that of the reduction in stiffness and ductility. Specifically, as corrosion increased, the energy absorbed by the beams decreased exponentially followed bya levelling off.

The absorption of energy by RC beams causes visible and measurable external responses, such as more frequent cracking of the tensile concrete and greater deflections, both of -which intensify as the applied load increases. When this load is applied to the beam, it is primarily supponed by internal moments and shears, and its effects are shear forces and bending moments that can be detennined using the la\VS of statics. At any section in the beam, the internal resisting shear and moment are necessary to equilibrate the applied shear force and bending moment. This internal resisting moment induces compressive and tensile forces "W.ithin the beam Cracking occurs -when these tensile forces cause the stresses at the bottom of the beam to exceed the tensile strength of the concrete (MacGregor and Bartlett, 2000).

Ganges in the cracking pattern are indicative of an altered absorbed energy. Indeed, the results of the beam tests revealed that a reduction in the absorbed energy due to increasing corrosion intensity was proponional to the number of flexural cracks and inversely proponional to the spacing of the flexural cracks. This relationship between toughness and flexural crack development is sho'Wll in Figure 7-15.

15 Since zero raised to the power of a negative number is not possible, the regression analysis was conducted with the ML of the control beam taken as 0.000l.

7.12 Ductility, Stiffness, and Toughness Compared
As mentioned previously, ductility is indicated by the deflection capacity, stiffness by the
slope of the IDe and toughness by the area under the IDC (up to failure). All three of these properties are related, in that they are revealed by the load-deflection behaviour. Toughness is the most connected, since the area under the IDC is greatly influenced by both the slope of the curve (i.e. stiffness) and the deflection that corresponds to the ultimate load (i.e. ductilitJ1.

The effect of corrosion on the ultimate load-carrying capacity is the final behavioural phenomenon of beams investigated in this study.

Figure 7-18: Comparison between the relative capacities of previous beam tests and those of the present study.

The earlier and quicker strength loss exhibited by the beams tested here can be attributed to the 3 mAl cm2 rate of corrosion used on these specimens, while the average rate for the other beams in Figure 7-18 is 1.35 mAl cm2· This idea is supponed by the findings of Mangat and Elgarl (1999a), --M10 studied the effect of corrosion rates on the flexural load capacity of beams. These researchers found that beam capacity decreases with increasing corrosion rates and this effect is enlarged with higher degrees of corrosion. The data collected from the beam tests in the literature encapsulates a wide range of factors, including beam sizes, reinforcement detailing, levels and rates of corrosion, and material
123

properties. For instance, the spans of these beams range from 900 to 3000 mm and steel bar sizes range from 8 to 19 mm.

Figure 7-19: Generalized trend of capacity loss of RC beams.

Due to this diversity in the sample population, a generalized trend for the capacity loss of RC beams with increasing corrosion is generated by means of logarithmic regression analysis. Figure 7-19 is a plot containing all of the current and previous data with the logarithmic trend line and Equation 7-8 is the numerical expression of the trend, vm.ere B is the relative beam capacity, ML is the total percent mass loss, and r' is the coefficient of determination.

Equation 7-8

B

=

-0.089ln(ML) + 0.56

(r2 = 0.41)

124

Granted, the coefficient of determination in this case is quite low (i' = 0.41), but a large scanering of data is expected in a general case such as this. In order to gain a clearer and more specific picture, the sample size must be enlarged and categorized according to different parameters, such a bar diameter, tensile and compressive reinforcement ratio, cover thickness, bar yield strength, and concrete compressive strength.

7.14 Importance of Bond Strength
The load-carrying capacity of RC beams -with corroded reinforcement has been studied by many researchers and those consulted for this study have all concluded that ultimate strength decreases -with increasing corrosion (Higgins and Farrow, 2006; Maadda-wy et ai, 200Sb; Perno et al., 2005; Dekoster et al., 2003). However, there has been much speculation regarding the causes of this effect and the general consensus appears to have shifted While earlier studies neglected to consider reductions in bond strength as a factor, recent -works have focused on the importance of bond strength when considering ultimate capacity. Uomoto and Misra (1988) anributed a decrease in the load-carrying capacity of corroded RC beams to both the reduction in the reinforcement area and the cracking of the concrete. In contrast, Al-Sulaimani et ai (1990) concluded that the decrease was primarily caused by the reduced area of the reinforcing steeL stressing that it was ra due to a reduction in bond stress. Meanwhile, Rodriguez et ai (1997) surmised that pining of the reinforcing steel had

J

the greatest impact on load-carrying capacity. Despite their differing view;, these researchers

all recognized the deterioration of the concrete cover as being relevant but did not consider
bond strength to be a factor.

I

1

125

On the contrary, Mangat and Elgarf (1999a) more recently proposed that, " ... the reduction in reinforcing bar section due to corrosion has an insi?J1iji.aut effect on the residual flexu.ral strength of beams." In fact, they hypothesized that a reduction in flexu.ral strength is mainly related to the deterioration of the bond at the steel-concrete interlace. Furthermore, Mangat and Elgarf (1999b) observed in another study that when a bond failure occurs, the tensile stress in the reinforcement is less than its yield stress. This indicates that bond strength plays a key role in reducing ultimate capacity. Moreover, Castel et al (2000a; 2000b) carried out a two-pan study in order to investigate the mechanical behaviour of corroded RC beams, wherein the effect of bond strength was only considered in the latter half. The results of this study demonstrate that if the influence of bond strength is acknowledged, it will have a positive correlation with ultimate strength. If bond strength is ignored, on the other hand, the loss of rebar cross-sectional area will be the only factor determining residual strength. Thus, these researchers argued that bond strength should be taken into aCCOl.Ult when studying the residual capacity of RC beams. For this reason, the present study was designed to include pullout tests in an attempt to find the relative bond strength of the tensile steel at different levels of corrosion and relate this to relative beam capacities.

I

7.15 Effect of Corrosion on Bond Strength
Previous research "\\Urk has found that as corrosion progresses, there is generally an initial increase in bond strength prior to a decrease. While Arnleh (2000) reported this decrease as gradual, Olung et al (2004) described it as rapid The latter characterization is consistent with the results observed in the present study, where there was an initial increase in bond strength

126

follo-wed by a rapid decrease. The relationship bet-ween the losses in relative bond strength and bar mass (ignoring the initial increase) is portrayed in Figure 7-20, which plots the findings of the pullout study.

Figure 7-20: Relative bond strength versus mass loss.

A numerical relationship to calculate the reduction in bond strength in tenns of bar mass loss
was obtained byperfonning logarithmic regression analysis 17 on instances showing a decrease

in the relative bond strength. Equation 7-9 gives this correlation, where

'ret

is the relative

bond strength, ML is the total percent mass loss (in decimal fonn), and r' is the coefficient of detennination. This nonlinear relationship bet-ween bond stress and corrosion supports the findings of CJllmg et al. (2004).
17 Since In(O) is not possible, the regression analysis was conducted with the ML ofthe control beam taken as 0.0001.

127

Equation 7-9

Using Equation 7-9 as a reduction factor and multiplying it with Equation 4-2 yields Equation 7-10, where

is the average residual bond strength, Rc is measured from the

centre of the bar to the closest surface, db is the diameter of the bar, and compressive strength of concrete.

f:

is the

Equation 7-10

However, Equation 7-9 is only able to provide a close estimate of the bond strength at the rebar surface in the beam specimens tested for this study. The actual bond strength cannot be calculated using this equation for t\\{) main reasons. Firstly, the cover of the tensile bars in the beam was 36 rum, while the cover in the pullout specimens was 42 mm Secondly, the bars in the beam specimens had the benefit of the confinement provided by the stirrups, whereas pullout specimens did not.

7.16 Relationships with Beam Capacity
Some researchers have proposed models for predicting the residual strength of corroded RC beams, claiming good correlation with their o"WIl and! or other available experimental data (Azher, 2005; Mangat and Elgart, 1999a; Rodriquez, 1997; Eyre and Nokhasteh, 1992; and

Cairns and Zhao, 1993). While these models may provide greatly needed insight into beam
capacity reductions, many have been criticized by Maadda\\y et al. (2005) for oversimplification since they fail to take into account the coupled effects of the reductions in both the steel cross-sectional area and bond strength.

128

Improved ultimate strength models can be developed with further study, as well as a beuer llllderstanding of the holistic nature and behaviour of RC beams suffering from corrosion. A cliscussion of the relationships between beam capacity and a variety of phenomena, as established in the present study is essential. Figure 7-21 is a diagram illustrating these relationships.

7.16.1 Beam Capacity and Bond Strength
As corrosion increased, the reduction in bond strength was fOlllld to exceed the reduction in

beam capacity. This is evident in Figure 7-22, which graphs Equation 7-9 (for bond strength) and Equation 7-7 (for beam capaci~. Adding these equations together yields the numerical relationship (see Equation 7-11) between bond strength and beam capacity, vmere

this

Yet, it has been proven that after the de-bonding of the tensile steel in the shear span, arch action is initiated and the forces are transferred to the supports

via an inclined compressive

strut (as discussed in 7.4 ). In the present study, beam action cannot be used to reconcile the

7.16.2 Beam Capacity and Maximum Corrosion Crack Width
Corrosion cracks, which are induced by expanding rust products, contnbute to a reduction in both bond strength and beam capacity. Accordingly, the data obtained from the present study reveals that the capacity of the beam specimens tested is related to the maximum corrosion crack -width of the concrete surrOtlllding the tensile reinforcing steel Figure 7-24 plots this relationship and Equation 7-12 is its numerical expression, obtained by power regression analysis, "Where

The data in this figure suggests

distinct linear trends (represented by dashed lines in

Figure 7-30), vvhich intersect at (71.1%, 83.2%). The different slopes of these t\W lines imply that a considerable change in the behaviour of the beams occurred Specifically, as the capacity of the beam was reduced to 83.2% of the

the stiffness' rate of change

decreased, as indicated by the sharp increase in the slope.

It is estimated that this change occurs at a corrosion level (mass loss) of 1.67%, vvhich is the

average mass loss berneen the t\W beam specimens that are located near the intersection of the proposed linear trend lines. Given this, it can be argued that the beam specimens were stiffened after their capacity fell below 83.2%, or the corrosion level passed 1.67%.

Relative Stiffness

Figure 7-30: The relationship between beam capacity and stiffness

.As previously discussed, the stiffness of RC beams tends to change v.h.enever a redistribution
of internal stresses occurs. Since redistributions of internal stresses accompany changes in the internal equilibrating mechanism, it can be hypothesized that in this study, beam action -was replaced once the level of capacity fell below 83.2%. It can also be postulated that this replacement -was due to a shift towards arch action, as this is permitted by both the supportinduced confinement (as discussed in section 7.4 ) and the relatively short span. Moreover, according to Equation 7-11, a beam capacity of 83.2% corresponds to 54.5% bond strength. Thus, it can be inferred that this arch action -was initiated v.h.en the bars lost 45.5% of their bond

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.1 Summary
In this experimental study, twelve reinforced concrete (Rq beams were constructed, corroded and tested using four-point loading. The results of these tests were used to examine the beams' various responses to corrosion, with respect to the initial cracking load, flexural crack development, evolution of the failure mode, deflection ratio, ductility, stiffness, toughness, and beam capacity. The data collected from the experimental \VOrk in this study enabled the proposal of several numerical relationships that describe the altered behaviour of corroded RC beams.

8.2 Conc1us ions
Based on the results of this research program, the following conclusions can be dra-wn: The overall behaviour of the beam specimens tested conforms to that reponed in the literature, with reductions in the ultimate capacity, deflection capacity and stiffness upon

. . . mcreasmg corroSIon.
The initial cracking load of the beams
\VaS

observed to decrease at the onset of corrosion and

remain constant until a mass loss of about 10%, with a final increase to above the original initial cracking load

140

The beam tests revealed a change in flexural crack development with rising corrosion levels, in that there "'WclS a simultaneous increase in the average spacing and a decrease in the average number. The results of this experiment clearly indicated a dramatic shift in the nature of the failure of corroded RC beams, vvbich is confinned by the literaurre reviewed Specifically, it
"'WclS

J

observed in the present study that as corrosion increased, the failure mode of the beams shifted from predictable ductile flexure failures at mid-span, to more brittle failures near the suppon. In addition, severely corroded beams displayed sudden and extremely brittle failures at the suppon, having only one primaryfailure crack The results of this study indicate that there is a shift in the failure type of corroded beams, vvbich is substantiated in the literature reviewed This shift begins with the onset of corrosion and continues as corrosion propagates. Predicting the type of failure a corroded beam will experience at any given level of corrosion is clearly a topic that requires further resear<;h. This is imponant because knowing how a beam will likely fail can be used to direct measures taken to strengthen damaged beams and possibly prevent an impending failure. In spite of precautionary measures taken, the accelerated corrosion intended for the tensile steel in the beams tested resulted in the corrosion of the stirrups as well This caused cracking and delamination of the surrounding concrete, vvbich contributed to the lowering of the residual strength and influenced the location of failure in at least one instance. Based on the data collected, several new corrosion-dependant empirical relationships were established to model the altered responses of RC beams, including ones with beam stiffness, deflection ratio, ductility, and toughness.

141

It was found in this study that at a corrosion level of 10.25%, beam deflections increased bya

factor of 1.54. Similarly, Cabrera (1996) reponed that when the corrosion level reached 9%, beam deflections increased by a factor of 1.5. What distinguishes the present study from Cabrera's is the distribution of the results, indicating a logarithmic relationship rather than a simple linear one. The data obtained in the current study testifies that ductility is reduced with increasing corrosion, with an exponential decrease follo-wed by stabilization at approximately 75% of the original ductility. This observation is similar to the trend found by Castel et al. (2000b), who reponed this stabilization as occurring at approximately 70% of the original ductility. In this study, the slope of the load-deflection curve (IDG was used to indicate the stiffness of the RC beams tested As corrosion increased, their stiffness decreased exponentially and then stabilized at approximately 70% of the original, much like ductility loss. The area under the LDC up to failure
WclS

used to determine the toughness of the RC beams

tested The data acquired sho"'Wed a similar trend to that of the reduction in stiffness and ductility. Specifically, as corrosion increased, the energy absorbed decreased exponentially, follo"'Wed by a levelling off. The difference in this case, hO"'Wever, is that the stabilization occurred at a lO"'Wer value of approximately 40% of the original toughness. The res ults obtained from the experimental study for relative ductility, stiffness, and toughness "'Were all best numerically modelled (i.e. yielding the highest coefficient of determination) by po"'Wer regression analysis. When these numerical relationships are compared, the relative stiffness is approximately equal to the relative ductility, which are both roughly twice the relative toughness.

142

For the purpose of this study, the results of over 100 corroded-beam tests conducted by other researchers 'Were revie'Wed and a generalized equation for the capacity loss of RC beams in terms of steel mass loss was generated by-wayof logarithmic regression analysis. Numerical relationships 'Were identified bet'Ween a reduced beam capacity and various phenomena. Namely, the total mass loss, maximum corrosion crack width, number and spacing of flexural cracks, touglmess, deflection ratio, ductility, stiffness, and bond strength of the tensile steel 'Were examined These relationships are valuable in their potential for aiding in the development of an accurate prediction model of beam capacity. The results of the beam tests indicated a redistribution of internal stresses and a shift in the manner in .wich the applied load was transferred to the supports. It is hypothesised that when the level of corrosion reached 1.67%, beam action was replaced with arch action, due to the following: The capacity loss was relatively minor when compared to the bond loss. Since beam action

I
1 ,
J

cannot account for the capacities observed given such low bond strengths, it can be deduced that as corrosion progressed, beam action was replaced with an alternative such as arch actioIL After considering the work of Coronelli and Gambarova (2004), Cairns and Zhao (1993), and Rodriguez et al (1997), it can be concluded that the support-induced confinement of the beams tested was sufficient to allow for arch action. The data acquired from the present experimental study sho'Wed that after the capacity

I

dropped below 83.2%, the beams stiffened dramatically, indicating a redistribution of internal stresses. A distribution such as this can be explained by a change from beam to arch actioIL

j

j

143

TIlls capacity of 83.2% corresponds to the corrosion level of 1.67% mentioned above, \\hich
was established using numerical relationships derived from the beam tests performed

r

In sum, the results of this laboratory study have led to a beuer understanding, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the impact of corrosion on various phenomena of reinforced concrete beams with corroded reinforcing steel Moreover, several relationships involving the ultimate capacity and the level of corrosion were developed

8.3 Recommendations for Future Research
Further research is required in order to gain a beuer understanding of the behavioural changes of RC beams due to corrosion. The following studies are recommended:
It is evident from the tests conducted that corrosion of the stirrups occurred To investigate

the effect that the corrosion of the stirrups had on the results of this experiment, similar beams should be tested without stirrups or with external stirrups. Such tests vvould also aid in the understanding of how the confinement of the concrete surrounding tensile bars affects the behaviour of corroded RC beams, particularly load-carrying capacity. The results of the beam tests point to both the slipping and anchoring of the tensile bars; the lack of the widening of flexural cracks is symptomatic of the loss of anchorage, whereas the forces at the bearn-ends suggest sufficient support-induced confinement to anchor the bars and allow for arch action. In order to learn more about this apparent contradiction, examining the anchorage of the bars of similar beams is recommended This may be achieved through the measurement of bar slippage at the ends of the beams and the strains of both the tensile steel and concrete. This recommendation may also validate or refute the notion of the onset of arch action at the estimated corrosion level of 1.67%.
144

The measurement of the steel and concrete strains may also identify the manner in which the stresses -were redistributed after the degradation of bond, and shed light on the unexpected failure modes of the corroded beams tested in this study. Forcing anchorage of the tensile steel may affect the -way in which the beams react to corrosion. This can be achieved by testing beams similar to those in this experiment, but with -well-anchored bars (ie. bars having hooks or bends at the bearn-ends). A study of this nature can then be contrasted with the current findings in order to investigate the effects of anchorage on both the initiation of arch action and the evolution of the failure mode. In closing, a great deal of testing is required before the nature and behaviour of corroded RC beams can be comprehended, as there are numerous variables to consider. These variables include the concrete cover thickness, bar size, reinforcement ratio, moment ann length, beam depth, and concrete permeability and compressive strength. A holistic understanding of RC beams with corroded reinforcing steel can only be achieved once each factor is understood individually. Moreover, the identification of cause and effect relationships
be~en

the

variables and corroded RC beams is required to accurately model these elements and predict their residual strength and service life. Finally, the development of practice-oriented equations for the evaluation of RC beams that consider the loss of both bond and steel cross-sectional area vvould contribute to the

J

structural engineering community. Hov.ever, the detennination of the input parameters could pose a major limitation to these equations, which must be overcome before they can be used to facilitate the assessment of structures in the field For instance, there are currently no methods available to conveniently detennine either the cross-section reduction (location and distribution of pits) or the residual bond strength of corroded reinforcing steel The

j

145

development of these methods VvOuld make the practice-oriented equations viable, \\bich would undoubtedly prove to be a great asset to engineers in the field
