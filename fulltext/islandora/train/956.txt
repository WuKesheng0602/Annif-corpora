ABSTRACT

In Vivo Neutron Activation Analysis (lVNAA) has been investigated to
measure aluminum levels in bone for several years. Aluminum, being a toxic element, should be routinely monitored in both clinical and occupational environments. The non-invasive IVNAA technique developed at the McMaster University Accelerator Lab is currently being improved for future use.

New sets of hand phantoms were prepared that closely resemble spectra that were collected from the hand of healthy subject. Following the IVNAA of aluminum phantoms, the technique was applied for the first time to measure bone Al levels in 18 healthy subjects. The mean hand bone Al concentration was determined as 28 Jlg AI/g Ca. The results were achieved with a dose equivalent of 17.6 mSv. Further investigations using an enhanced detection system and

applying optimization of the irradiation protocol with radiation dose up to 50 mSv
·~~·~'~sliowed that minimum detectable limit was improved to 0.10 mg AI.

Chapter I Introduction

1.1

Importance of Aluminum

Aluminum (AI) is the third most naturally abundant and the most prevalent element in the earth's crust. Al is a toxic element to which all

individuals are exposed through food, air, water, and soil. Since Al is ubiquitous, there is a continuous exposure to this element via the environment and diet. Al is a chemically reactive element and is found combined with other elements like oxygen, silicon, and fluorine. It is found to be dissolved in water and acid rain, due to its low pH level, increases the solubility of Al in rivers and lakes.

1.1.1

Biological importance

Even if this element is present only in trace amounts in biological matter, harmful biological effects of Al have been a topic of interest of research for several decades. There are no known physiological needs for Al in the human body

~c-:~;--~s(Garbossa et a/., 1998) and, in addition, its atomic size (O.051nm) and electric

charge (3+) makes it an aggressive inhibitor of several essential elements of similar

1

characteristics, such as magnesium, calcium and iron.

AI could interfere with

homeostatic and metabolic activities of these essential human body elements and thus, inhibit bone mineralization (Alfrey et al., 1984, 1994; Yokel, 2000; Campbell

et al., 2001; Ward et al., 2001).

1.1.2 Aluminum Products

Al mixes with other metals to form alloys which are harder and stronger and are used to make many products. Al compounds are found in a number of

engineering and end-user products, such as alums in water-treatment, alumina in abrasives, furnace linings, siding and roofmg and airplanes (ASTDR). It is also found in antacids (Yokel et al., 2004), astringents, buffered aspirins (Hem and White, 1989), antiperspirants (Laden et a/., 1988; Darbre et al., 2003, 2005), dental rinses and tooth pastes (Yokel et al., 2004), pots and pans as well as being used in explosives and fireworks (Gitelman, 1989). Furthermore, it is present in processed food, drinking water, soy based infant formula, intravenous fluids (Sedman et al., 1985; Bishop et al., 1997; Advenier et a/., 2003) and in vaccinations (Keith et aI., 2002).

1.2

Exposures to Aluminum

All living beings are exposed to AI through the skin, lungs and intestinal tract.
It has been documented that exposure of fish to Al resulted in severe

haematological disorders (Witters et al. 1990). Al may also be involved in the action of enzymes such as succinic dehydrase and D-aminolevulinate dehydrase which are present in porphyrin synthesis. Increased erythrocyte protoporphyrin was reported in patients on chronic haemodialysis (Fontanellas et al. 1994). It was also found that Al retards bacterial growth and enhances the porphyrin formation (Scharf et al., 1994).

1.2.1

Clinical Exposure

Al was present in hemodialysis fluid until the 1970s; as a consequence higher Al load in bones was found in dialysis patients which could result in death (Alfrey et a!., 1972, Alfrey, 1976). Studies have identified Al as a co-factor for the development of dementia and osteomalacic osteodystrophy (Parsons et al., 1971; Ellis et a!., 1979; Fontanellas et a!., 1994). Presently, clinical exposure to trace levels of Al in the dialysis fluid and use of Al based phosphate binders in

r--

Rahman et al., 2003) and bone related secondary ailments like osteodystrophy, osteoarthritis (Cassidy, 2003), and osteomalacia (Alfrey, 1976, 1993; Ott et a!., 1983). Another clinical exposure to Al is through intravenous solutions (Wilhelm et al., 2001). Sedman and colleagues (1985) reported elevated levels of this element in the bone, urine and plasma of premature infants who were undergoing intravenous therapy (Sedman et al., 1985; Bishop et al., 1989). In addition, victims of Al exposure also include patients on total parenteral nutrition [TPN] (Klein and Coburn, 1994) and patients with severe bums (Klein et al., 1994). The process of ceasing hemorrhage in the urinary bladder using alum irrigation (Murphy et a!., 1992), and patients undergoing cranial bone reconstruction with Al made bone cement (Hantson et a!., 1994; Renand et a!., 1994) leads to AI accumulation. These clinical exposures to Al are found to be fatal, according to the research by Nakamura and colleagues (Nakamura et al., 2000).

1.2.2 Occupational Exposure

Exposure to Al in the occupational setting is of concern. For example, ground Al and Al oxide in 'McIntyre powder' was used as a prophylactic agent against silicosis (lung disease) between 1944 and 1979 in Ontario mines. A

morbidity prevalence study conducted on the exposed miners showed they performed worse in cognitive tests than unexposed miners (Rifat et al., 1990). It

4

(

is also accepted that workers in welding and Al smelting plants exposed to excessive Al show neuropsychiatric symptoms characterized by poor

coordination, memory loss, and depression (Sjogren et al., 1990; White et al., 1992; Sim et al., 1997; Polizzi et al., 2002). There is a steady buildup and longterm retention of Al within the respiratory tract of workers who are repeatedly exposed in occupational surroundings (Schlesinger et al. 2000).

Furthermore, the occupational exposure to Al dust through the respiratory tract in welders resulted in raised levels of the element in serum and urine, as well as in bone biopsy samples (Elinder et a!. 1991; Gitelman et aI., 1995; Gitelman, 1995; Bast-Pettersen et a!., 2000). Studies performed to investigate the impact of occupational exposure of Al in welders on cognitive and motor test showed an inferior performance of exposed group compared to that of control group (Buchta et aI., 2005; Meyer-Baron et aI., 2007). Al in serum and urinary excretion of highly exposed workers depends on both the level and duration of exposure but provides information only about the recent exposure levels of AI.

1.2.3 Dietary Exposure

Small amounts of Al are present in our food. Aluminum foils and cooking utensils add further Al to our food during cooking. Food additives such as baking

5

~

powder, cake mixes, pancake mixes, frozen dough and processed cheese all contain this element. Studies state that the average Al intake by an adult male is 1Om~day and by an adult female is 7 mg/day (Flarend, 2001). The concentration of Al in natural water (less than 0.1 mgIL generally) can vary significantly, in a range of 0.4-1 mg/L, depending on various physicochemical and mineralogical factors. Al levels in drinking water vary according to the levels found in the source and whether or not it is used during water treatment. Al salts are widely used in water treatment as coagulants to reduce organic matter, color, turbidity, and microorganism levels. Such. use may lead to increased concentrations of Al in

treated water, but generally there is very little consumption of the element from drinking water (Yokel et al., 2001).

1.3

Intake, Distribution and Elimination of Aluminum in the body

As stated above, the main pathways of Al to the human body are through the skin, lungs and intestinal tract. One of the major routes of Al absorption is through the gastrointestinal tract (Ittel, 1993). Several proposals have been put forward to explain the Al absorption mechanism through the gut, but there is no exact and valid justification for it (Exley et al., 1996). Cochran et al. (1993) proposed the presence of aluminum-specific proteins that bind this element with the intestinal mucosa and thereby regulate Al absorption.

6

In aluminum smelting plants the workers are exposed to AI through inhalation of dusts and aerosols. Once Al is inhaled, it accumulates in the brain through the olfactory system (Exley et aI., 1996). It has also been shown that AI dust and particle intake by the workers are uploaded through the lung epithelia (Gitelman et aI., 1995) as well as through the gut as particulates are swallowed (Rollin et aI., 1993).

The skin acts as a minor route of Al entry into the body. Application of deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate results in up to 0.012% absorption through the skin (Flarend et aI., 2001). A case study of a hyperaluminemia in a female using an antiperspirant for 4 years has recently been reported in literature (Guillard et ale 2004). On the other hand, some studies report that the skin

applications of Al compounds in cosmetic and health care products generally do not induce harmful effects on skin or other organs (Sorrenson et aI., 1974; Brusewitz, 1984).

It is estimated that in healthy human subjects, the total body burden is 3050 mg (ATSDR, 1999; U.S. Public Health Service, 1992, p. 26; Alfrey, 1984; Ganrot, 1986). In a normal population, about one-half of the total amount of Al
oJ

stored in the body is in the skeleton (50%) and the rest is in the lungs (25%), kidneys and brain (Gamot, 1986). Al is found to be retained in bone and kidneys

7

~

r

after an oral exposure as reported by Chan (Chan et al 1988).

The highest

concentration of Al is found to be stored in bone (Zafar et aI., 1997). It has also been documented that a higher Al concentration is found in trabecular bone in comparison with the cortical bone (Alfrey et aI., 1976). Therefore, bone

represents a suitable organ to obtain information about the cumulative Al levels in a person.

The major route for the elimination of Al normally absorbed by the body is through kidney. If one is exposed to large amounts of this element, the kidneys may not be capable of excreting the excess Al resulting in its retention. Another pathway for Al elimination is through the bile. Almost 75-90% of an oral dose of Al in humans was reported to be excreted in the feces (Greger et al., 1983). However, urinary excretion is the major excretory route once the element enters the blood stream (Skalsky & Carchman, 1983).

1.4

Aluminum Related Diseases

Dialysis encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease are the main two diseases that are associated with Al toxicity. The first one is observed in dialysis patients through Al exposure from dialysis fluid and aluminum hydroxide phosphate binders. The predominant features of AI-related bone diseases are

8

defective mineralization and osteomalacia; they result from excessive deposits at the site of osteoid mineralization, where calcium would normally be placed. An excess of AI has been shown to induce microcytic anemia as daily injections of AI into rabbits produced severe anemia within 2-3 weeks (Yokel et al., 1997).

The role of Al in Alzheimer's disease remains a controversial subject in research (Crapper et al., 1980, 1994; McLachlan, 1986, 1995; Savory et al., 2007; Zatta et aI., 1993, 2006; Munoz et al., 1998; Exley, 2001; Exley and Korchaazhkina, 2001). A pathogenetic role of the element in Alzheimer's disease has been suggested in animal studies of AI-induced neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD). In this, an increased concentration of Al in brain is absorbed in the form of Al alkaloid and forms neurofibrillary tangles that affect the brain nerves. This also affects the blood brain barrier (BBB), thus allowing toxins to reach the central nervous system. Divergent results have been reported independently in literature (Klatzo et al., 196;5; Makjanic et aI., 1998; Kawahara et al., 2001). These controversies have led to an overall understanding that, under normal circumstances, if the gut Al absorption and renal functions are not compromised, and the blood - brain barrier (BBB) is not damaged through surgery, then Al toxins are blocked from entering the brain and Al does not pose a health risk from
"

neurotoxicity (Imray et aI., 1998).

9

Nausea, anorexia and skin problems are associated with severe Al toxicity.
It has been documented that accumulation of Al has caused bone fragility in

patients with Alzheimer's disease (Mjoberg et al., 1997). Bone Al upload is associated with reduced amounts of unmineralized osteoid and low bone fonnation and is referred to as aplastic bone disease (Andress et al., 1987). Osteopenia and fractures have been found in premature infants fed with parenteral nutrition (Popinska et al., 1999). Even if Al toxicity is a well studied subject, its mechanism of action at cellular level is still not clear (Levesque et al., 2000).

1.5

Detection of Aluminum

There are several in vitro techniques that are used for the detection of Al in human tissues such as atomic emission and absorption spectroscopy, electro thennal atomic absorption spectroscopy (Litov et al., 1989; Kruger and Parsons, 2007), and neutron activation analysis (Sharif et aI., 2004). These analytical

techniques have limited success in the detection of this element in human body and tissues due to several reasons like sensitivity, contamination and/or need to destroy the sample. Some of these in-vitro methods such as atomic absorption

spectroscopy are now routinely available in a clinical· environment along with staining and digestion techniques.

10
I,>'

!

¥

Iliac crest bone biopsy with specific staining is the routine clinical method of detection of cumulative toxic levels of Al in bone (Malluche et al., 1999; Walton

et a/., 2007); however the limitations of bone biopsy are that it is an invasive and
painful method (Spasovski, 2004); consequently, it has a low patient acceptance. Bone biopsy cannot be routinely repeated over time and the mass of the biopsy sample being small may not be representative of the levels of Al in the total bone or body. For all these reasons, this method has limited value for routine monitoring of cumulative bone Al levels.

Another method of detection of Al in human body is the in vivo method called neutron activation analysis, which depends on the excitation of Al nuclei within the human body via neutron activation. This method is non invasive and painless, and thus believed to be more suitable than biopsy for monitoring the accumulation of this element in the human body.

1.5.1 In Vivo Neutron Activation Analysis

In Vivo Neutron Activation Analysis (IVNAA) is an analytical method for
determining elements of interest in a sample when irradiated by neutrons (Scott and
~

Chettle, 1986).

Reactors, isotopes or accelerators can be used as sources of

neutrons in IVNAA. Neutrons with energies in the range of kilo to mega electron

11

L

~I
,

volt are utilized depending upon the type of neutrons used in this technique. For most IVNAA of trace elements in the human body, thermal neutrons are employed. Once neutrons hit the biological sample, they undergo elastic and inelastic scattering with a loss of energy to form thermal neutrons with energy in the range of milli electron volt. The energy of thermal neutrons results in a neutron cross section (0') that is inversely proportional to the velocity of neutrons of the element. When the thermal neutrons strike a sample, high energy penetrating gamma rays are emitted. The gamma rays that are emitted during irradiation are called prompt gamma rays and those emitted after irradiation are called delayed gamma rays. These gamma rays are representative of the nuclei which emit them. The excited nucleus as a result of nuclear interaction of neutrons will descend to a stable state by the emission of gamma rays of energy characteristic to that particular nucleus or isotope.

The characteristic gamma rays are detected using energy sensitive detectors and they identify the emitting nucleus. The intensity of the gamma rays gives a measure of the abundance of the nucleus in the sample. The main advantage of IVNAA is the long attenuation mean free paths of neutrons and gamma rays in tissue, which makes it possible to detect elements in deep seated organs.

12

The main disadvantage of IVNAA is the production of the same fmal product by neutron activation of different elements present in the sample resulting in a direct interference. The other drawbacks include the energy dependence of the nuclear cross section and the complex spectra of gamma rays from the human body. The IVNAA not only depends on the cross section but also depends on the half- life of the element under consideration. In order to obtain maximum gamma ray

intensity, it is ideal to set high efficiency detectors close to the target organ. The detectors should have high energy resolution and the efficiency should be independent of the size and shape of the target organ. There are different types of detectors used in the IVNAA, and the various types and sizes could affect the measurement sensitivity. Another factor that can affect measurement sensitivity is the non-uniform distribution of thermal neutrons. The IVNAA method has been successfully utilized to detect several minor and trace elements in human tissues in
vivo, like manganese (Aslam et aI., 2008a), magnesium (Aslam et aI., 2008b) and

Al using thermal neutron activation (Ellis et a!., 1988; Green et al., 1993; Pejovi6Mili6 et aI., 2005).

1.5.2 In Vivo Neutron Activation Analysis ofAluminum

Al can be measured using in vivo neutron activation analysis via thermal neutron activation of 27Al using the reaction 27AI(n,
y)28 AI.

Of the nine isotopes of

13

L

Al whose mass numbers range from 23 to 30, only 27Al and 26Al occur naturally. 27Al is the stable isotope of AI, with 100% abundance. The thermal neutrons used in this IVNAA have energy 0.025 eV which results in a maximum cross-section of 0.23 barn. 28Al produced is radioactive and unstable. It will decay with a half life of 2.25 min to fonn an excited state of 28Si. The unstable 28Si soon undergo nuclear de-excitation with the emission of gamma rays of energy 1. 78 MeV (100%). If fast neutrons are present in IVNAA, interfering reactions of 31 P(n,

<li8AI and 28 Si(n,

p)28AI with thresholds of 1.95 MeV and 4 MeV respectively are also present. Since phosphorus is present in large amounts compared to Al in human body, a small proportion of the fast energetic neutrons can cause interference, and thus ambiguity in the result. Elimination of fast neutrons from the neutron beam avoids the The

activation Of 31 p and 28Si and makes the energy spectrum simpler to analyze.

half-life of 28AI is short, 2.25 min; thus the transfer of the irradiated sample from the neutron beam area to the counting area should be rapid. The irradiation time should also be kept short in order for 28Al not to decay too much during the irradiation. The other elements in the biological sample that typically undergo neutron activation simultaneously with Al are calcium, sodium and chlorine. The corresponding reactions are 48 Ca(n, y) 49Ca, 37CI(n, y) 38 CI, 23Na(n, y) 24Na and 26Mg(n, y) 27Mg respectively. The gamma rays emitted from these elements along with that emitted from AI form a spectrum typical of all these isotopes.

14

According to the chemical composition of Reference Man cited by ICRP 23(1975) the estimated amount of Al in the skeleton is 21 mg. This accounts for approximately 50% of the total body Al burden (Zafar et a!., 1997). The Al

concentration in bone tissue (hand bone) was measured in the present work (further details are given in section 2.1). The radiation dose associated with IVNAA was estimated by employing a tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC). The

radiation dose was kept as low as possible based on statistical precision requirements of the technique. The equivalent dose received by a subject during an irradiation procedure was estimated to be 17.6 mSv with an effective dose of 14.4 Il Sv.

A non-invasive, IVNAA measurement system of Al in human bone at McMaster Accelerator laboratory was previously reported (Pejovic-Milic et aI., 1998, 2005); however, preceding this work there were several laboratories in different countries involved in the development and use of application of the technique of IVNAA of bone Al in medical and health fields. IVNAA of Al in

human bone could be assessed by a minimal detectable limit (MDL) of the element under investigation and associated radiation dose delivered to a subject. The MDL of the system is obtained as an estimate of twice the uncertainty of zero Al

Chapter II
In Vivo Neutron Activation Analysis of Aluminum in Human Hand Bone

In the technique of in vivo neutron activation analysis (IVNAA), neutrons

of appropriate energies are produced from a neutron source (Tandetron Accelerator). These neutrons are used to irradiate the sample (phantom or hand bone) which is placed in an irradiation/shielding cavity. The sample contains 27AI, which is the only stable isotope of AI. This causes the 27AI(n, y)28A I

reaction to occur with a half life of 2.25 minutes and 28Al then decays to an excited state of 28Si, which instantly de-excites with the emission of 1. 78MeV yrays. The y-ray spectrum is detected using an array of eight 4n NaI(TI) detectors. There are also other elements like Ca, CI, N a and Mg in the tissue that will react with thermalised neutrons resulting in y-ray emission. After data analysis

(Marquardt Method) and calibration of the energy spectrum and counts, the peak intensity ratio of Al emitted y-rays to Ca emitted y-rays gives the ratio of Al to Ca concentration in the sample.

2.1

Why Hand Bone?

Themaj or parts of the human body that get affected by Al toxicity are bone, brain, kidneys and liver. The kidneys and liver are inconvenient target organs for IVNAA since they are surrounded by other critical organs. Moreover, these organs also contain many other toxic elements which would make the detection of Al more complex. The brain is not considered as a suitable organ for this diagnostic technique because of the complex central nervous system and proximity of other radiosensitive organs.

Zafar and colleagues reported in 1997 that the highest concentration of Al is found in bone. Bones of the human extremities, such as the hand, have a small amount of overlying tissue compared to bones present in other parts of the body. This allows for minimal signal attenuation and therefore a better detection of the elements present in the hand bone, including Ai. Hands can be stretched out so that radiation dose can be restricted to the palm, thus sparing the rest of the body from the unnecessary radiation dose. The hands of a healthy individual contain 3% of the skeleton(ICRP 23, 1975). Because of all mentioned reasons the hand bone is considered to be an apt site for Al measurement. Proper radiation shielding is placed around the extended arm to confine the radiation field only to the hand. In order to achieve a superior sensitivity of

19

the technique, the neutron irradiation should be uniform throughout the target and this target must contain homogeneously distributed AI. The attenuation of

neutrons by tissue is negligible as the layer of overlying tissue around the hand bone is thin and the source is close to the target.

2.1.1

Distribution of Aluminum in Cortical and Trabecular Bone

The estimated amount of Al in skeleton is 21 mg according to the chemical composition of Reference Man cited by ICRP 23(1975). It has been documented that the trabecular bone contains a higher Al concentration when compared to the cortical bone (Alfrey et aI., 1976). The human hand is composed of 95% of cortical bone and 5% of trabecular bone (ICRP 70, 1994). Based on the estimated measurements of intact cortical bones, the expected amount of Al in one hand of a healthy adult was found to be 0.3-0.4 mg. One of the primary reasons for taking the hand bone as the measurement site is the different distribution of the element in the cortical and trabecular bone. The choice of the subj ect' s extremities like hands, feet and leg -bones provides important information regarding the distribution and metabolism of the analyte element. Since the human hand consists of 95%- cortical bone, Al dissolved hand bone

2.2

Neutron Source

The neutrons that are utilized for the IVNAA technique can be produced using reactors, radioisotopes like
252 Cf

or accelerators.

The type of neutron

source and the production of neutrons play an important role in the system sensitivity. Different neutron sources generate neutrons with different energies, ranging from kilo-electron volt to mega-electron volt, as well as with different neutron flux. The sources which produce neutrons in the kilo electron volt range include reactors with filtered beams and radio isotope sources (y, n). The

Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (Ellis et aI., 1988) and McMaster Research Reactor (Palerme et al., 1993) are of the few neutron reactors that produce thermal/epithermal neutron beams used to measure bone Al in vivo. Reactors have high neutron flux, which is desirable for this technique, but they are expensive and are not typically clinically available.
252 Cf

is one neutron

source with a limited use to measure normal Al levels in a clinical environment due to the poor neutron beam quality (mega electron volt range) produced. The presence of fast neutrons in the beam of this source causes interference reactions from P and Si, and thus makes this source less sensitive to use for IVNAA of Al (see section 2.1.1). Particle accelerators produce neutrons with energies in the mega-electron volt range, with a medium to high neutron flux, which are adequate for the

21

,..--

~------- .....

detection of both minor and trace elements. For the bone Al IVNAA, however, the energy of produced neutrons could be controlled to be below the threshold energy of interfering reactions of P and Si (Pejovic-Milic. et aI., 2005). This significantly simplifies. the described technique by eliminating neutron activation of P and Si that are always present in a biological tissue. Therefore, in this work the portable accelerator-based source of neutrons is the preferred one due to its availability for clinical applications.

Tandetron Accelerator

~

The Tandetron Accelerator at McMaster Accelerator Laboratory (MAL), McMaster University, is a high current accelerator which can produce a mixed neutron-gamma field. The process of IVNAA using the Tandetron accelerator has been previously studied for elements like manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg) and reported in the literature (Aslam et a/., 2008a;Aslam et al., 2008b). The high beam current of the Tandetron accelerator was utilized for the first time for Al measurements in phantoms and human hand in this work.

A thick 7Li target was used to produce suitable energy neutrons by means of

,c=='~~'7Li(P, n) 7Bereaction. The target is mounted at the tip of the accelerator beam line.
The intense heating produced by the reaction is cooled down by using water

22

cooling. The 7Li target was bombarded with protons with energies in the range of 2.00-2.25 MeV and neutrons of energies in the range of 230-500 keV are produced (Aslam et al., 2006). This high current accelerator can presently run with currents up to 600 JlA with appropriate proton energy and irradiation time. The present work adopts proton energy of 2 MeV for the IVNAA technique.

One of the main advantages of this neutron source is that the energy of the neutrons produced is lower than the thresholds of 1.95 and 4.00 MeV needed to produce 28 A I from the interfering 31 p (n, a) 28 AI and 28 Si (n, p) 28 A I reactions. A study of the ratio of fast and thermal fluence in one system has shown an interference of 19 of Al is present in every 7g of phosphorus (Wyatt et aI., 1993). Thus the use of neutrons with energies below these threshold energies eases the analysis of Al in a bone sample -by eliminating the call for correction due to the substantial amount of phosphorus in the human body.

Alternatively 27 Al can be activated with the fast neutrons via the 27AI(n, p)27Mg reaction, with a threshold energy of 3MeV. emission of 0.84 MeV of gamma rays. 27Mg decays with the

Similarly this neutron reaction is not

allowed since its energy threshold is higher than the maximum neutron energy generated by the particle accelerator utilized.

23

The fundamental requirement in this work is to have a beam of thermal neutrons for irradiation of the hand. The neutrons produced with up to 230 keV energy, with a proton energy of 2 MeV at the Tandetron Accelerator, are later moderated in the irradiation/shielding cavity (see section 2.3 for more information) to become thermal neutrons. The high energy neutrons produced in the Tandetron accelerator collide with atoms of a polyethylene moderator and transfer a part of their energy to the nuclei of the moderator. Thus the velocities of neutrons are reduced to the thermal velocities of the nuclei producing thermal neutrons.

2.3

Irradiation/Shielding Cavity

In the present research, all the phantoms and subjects were irradiated within an irradiation/shielding cavity. Pejovic-Milic and colleagues in 2006

designed an irradiation/shielding cavity based on MCNP Monte Carlo simulations and further optimized it for clinical application (Pejovic-Milic et aI., 2000; Pejovic-Milic et al., 2006). The design of the cavity is such that irradiation of the patient is confined to the hand. The radiation dose to the rest of the body is maintained as low as possible. The cavity allows maximum thermal neutron flux to activate the Al and minimizes the fast and epithermal neutron components. It also minimizes the production of photons from the interaction of neutrons inside

24

the cavity as well as photons emitted by the Li target. The irradiation/shielding cavity plays a key role in the improvement of sensitivity of the technique of
IVNAA.

The in-vivo neutron irradiation facility at MAL for the measurement of Al and other trace elements consists of the cavity with a polyethylene moderator, a lead filter, a graphite reflector, borated plastic sheets, outer lead walls, an opening in the middle for the access of hand or phantoms, and proper shielding of the irradiated extremity. A layout of the irradiation facility is illustrated in Figure 1. The self enclosed type geometry of the cavity has a hand/phantom access port on one side. The dimension of the cavity is 50x60x50 cm3 · The polythene

moderates the neutron beam produced by the lithium· target and changes the fast neutron energy towards lower energies (0.025 eV). The graphite reflector

redirects some neutrons back to the irradiation site thus increasing Al activation. The lead filter was included in the design to reduce the unnecessary gamma dose to the hand from the target. A lead filter of thickness of 2.0 cm (-4 Half Value Layer (HVL» was chosen to reduce the transmission probability to the hand to
~5%

for 478 keV inelastic gamma rays produced in the target (Aslam et at.,

2002). The outer lead walls and the borated plastic sheets are an integral part of the irradiation/shielding cavity, which minimize the neutron and gamma dose to the subject's body. Majority neutrons in the reflector are absorbed by the

25

surrounding 1.4 cm thick borated plastic sheets through the

10B(n,

a) reaction.

This blocks the transmission of neutrons to the outside of the cavity with 99.8% efficiency. The irradiation/shielding cavity ensures a low radiation dose to the subject by filtering out the unnecessary gamma dose. The equivalent dose

received outside of the irradiation/shielding cavity is approximately 1/2260 of that received by the hand thus ensuring the efficacy of the cavity (Byun et al., 2007).

2.4

Detection System

After the hand/phantom has been irradiated with neutrons, hand/phantoms are transported from the hand access port of the cavity to the detection system for analyzing the spectra produced from the neutron activation. One of the main goals of the present study is to produce a technique that is feasible to measure Al

in subjects with a nonnal concentration of this element. Byun and colleagues
(2006) developed and tested a 4n detection system at MAL with high efficiency gamma ray detection. The present research utilized this 4n detection system for the in vivo Al measurement.

The 4n detection system (Figure 2) consists of an array of eight NaI (TI) detectors. The cross-sectional dimension of each detector is 102 x 102 x 406
mID.

An empty square shaped opening in the middle of the detector array is used

to place an irradiated hand/phantom. Since the opening extends from one side of the array to the opposite side, the solid angle is 3.83n which provides a high efficiency of the detector system. Signals from all· the eight detectors were

summed up using a locally developed summing circuit which was connected to a preamplifier. This signal was amplified using a NIM spectroscopy amplifier for a PC-based Multi-channel analyzer (MCA). The gamma ray spectra were collected using the software MaestroTM. It is important to note that although it would be

27

beneficial to have the irradiation and counting rooms in close proximity to minimize a transfer time between the activation and detection, they are in fact located at a distance to avoid the activation of the detector.

The third peak is the sum peak of the two gamma rays with energy 2.505 MeV. The next step in the energy calibration is to fix the energies of the first two peaks of energies 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV, respectively.

2.4.1

Gamma rays: Prompt and Delayed Gamma Emission

When the hand/phantom is irradiated with the neutron beam, penetrating gamma rays are emitted and collected by the detector array. The emission of gamma rays during neutron activation is called prompt gamma ray emission. The emission of gamma rays after the neutron activation is called delayed gamma ray emission. These gamma rays are generated from the nuclei in the hand/phantom upon the absorption of energy from the impacting neutrons. In IVNAA of AI, the 27Al is neutron activated to form 28Al which decays to 28 Si by emission of gamma rays; 27Al + In 28A I

Data Analysis

Gamma ray spectra were collected and analyzed to determine the areas under the Al 1.78 MeV and Ca 3.08 MeV peaks, using Marquardt analysis (Bevington, 1992) (a non-linear least squares function fitted to the data in the energy regions around the two principal peaks of interest). A mathematical model was fitted to the spectra and the reduced chi-squared space was searched for a minimum to determine the peak parameters. The spectra were analyzed from 1.20 - 2.56 MeV for the Al peak. The peak was fitted with a Gaussian function on a quadratic background; the fitting function also included two surrounding peaks of Na and Cllocated at 1.37 and 2.17 MeV respectively. The position of the Al peak was coupled to that of the more prominent peak of CI at 1.64 MeV. A separate fitting procedure using a Gaussian function with a quadratic background between 2.96-3.40 MeV was adopted to obtain the area under the Ca peak. Further details of the fitting procedures adopted in this study are available in the literature (Pejovi6Mili6 et al., 1998).

I·

2.5.1

Marquardt Method

Marquardt analysis is a method of data analysis that uses a non-linear least squares function fitted to the data in the energy regions around the principal peaks

31

of interest. It is a mathematical model that replicates three Gaussian functions on a quadratic background that is fitted to the spectra. The function that was used for fitting the spectra in the present study is as follows

y=bl+b2X+b3X2+Al/[Sl(21t)1I2] exp(-0.5(x-clils12) + A 2/[S2(21t)1I2] exp(-O.5(x-c2ils/)

+Ai[s3(21t)112] exp(-O. 5(x-C 3iI S32)

(equation 2.2)

where b l+b2x+b3x2 represents the quadratic background, A/[Si(21t)1I2]exp(-O.5(x-

ciils?) represents the Gaussian function. Al represents the area under the first CI
pe*; Sl and CI represent the width and position of the first CI peak, respectively. Similarly A2 and A3 represent the areas under the Al and second CI peaks respectively. The corresponding width and position of the Al and second CI

peaks are S2 & C2 and S3 & C3, respectively. An important step in the fitting is an iteration procedure that will reduce the number of parameters to be fitted by fixing the width of the Gaussian peaks. The peak parameters are determined with a least chi-square method in this analysis. The reduced chi-square of the analysis represents the effectiveness of the fitting. Thus, with the Marquardt analysis, the area under the peak of interest can be calculated. Since the CI in the biological sample or human hand is activated with thermal neutrons simultaneously with AI,
~-~--~=-"--'--we fitted the overlapped region covering the CI (1.64 MeV) and Al (1.78)

32

.characteristic peaks with two Gaussian.

There were also two separate fitting

routines that were applied to AI and Ca characteristic peaks separately.

2.5.2

Calibration Line

The area under the Al peak in the case of phantom studies or the ratios of the AlICa in the case of human studies are used to develop the calibration curve. For phantom samples, the calibration line was obtained by plotting the area under the Al peak, determined from the Marquardt analysis, versus the Al mass in each phantom. The best fit line, regression line, was determined by a linear leastsquares method.

For human studies, the calibration line was obtained from the plot of the ratio of the areas of the Al and Ca peaks versus Al mass. This Ca normalization is preferred to the direct use of AI, since it simplifies the technique utilized. In fact, the number of counts from Al in the hand depends upon various parameters like size of the hand, thickness of overlying tissue, neutron field profile and fluence along with the irradiation and counting geometry; thus, there is a need for extensive corrections for all these factors. To overcome all these necessary

corrections, normalization with the Ca present has been performed as suggested in the literature (Ellis et al., 1988). Since 98% of the Ca is stored in the skeleton, the

33

I

,..-

amount of irradiated bone mass can directly be estimated from 49Ca which is simultaneously activated with AI in hand bone through the reaction 48Ca (n, y) 49Ca (cr =1.09 barn). The AVCa ratio provides an index of elevated Al level per unit bone mass.

2.5.3

Minimum Detectable Limit (MDL)

Once the calibration curve is generated, its slope provides information about the sensitivity of the IVNAA technique. Therefore, each different set of irradiation/counting parameters provides different detection limits. The minimum detectable limit (MDL) of the system is obtained as an estimate of twice the uncertainty of zero Al phantoms divided by the slope of the calibration line (Palerme et aI., 1993).

Another method of assessing the sensitivity and performance of the technique is by calculating a figure of merit (FOM), which depends on the MDL of the system. The FOM takes into account the MDL and the equivalent dose to hand which accompanies the IVNAA measurements. MDL, as defined earlier, is the ratio of the uncertainty in the area of the Al peak in a 0.0 f.lg AI/g Ca phantom to the sensitivity of the technique. The uncertainty in peak area is approximately proportional to the square root of the equivalent dose,
Hl12,

and the sensitivity is

34

proportional to H. Thus the MDL is then proportional to II H1I2. The FOM is defmed as the product of H1I2 by MDL and compares the performance of techniques. FOM can be used to compare the performance of the technique

developed here with various other IVNAA techniques reported in literature. A lower FOM will be indicative ofbetler performance ofa technique.

2.6

Dosimetry

The dosimetry measurements of the IVNAA technique must be performed prior to the application in human subjects. The dose delivered to a subject's hand during an Al measurement is total energy deposition coming from different kinds of radiation such as neutrons, gamma rays, recoil and decay of some atoms. It is also documented that the dose delivered to the hand is associated with many parameters such as the incident proton energy, irradiation time, irradiation cavity design, and neutron yield «Aslam et aI, 2003). The use of a tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) measurement will take into account the neutron and gamma dose, and thus give a precise measurement of the absorbed dose. Neutron micro dosimetry measures the deposited energy, linear energy density and the quality factor (Arnold, 2000). The thermal neutron flux within the

irradiation/shielding cavity was measured using an indium foil experiment

35

r w

(Pejovic-Milic et al., 2006). This flux measurement gives an estimate of the thermal dose delivered to the subject's hand during the irradiation.

2.6.1

Neutron Dose

The neutron dose depends on the incident neutron energy since the radiation weighting factor for neutrons also depends on energy. The reactions in the hand by thermal neutrons are 27AI(n, ri8AI, 48Ca(n, rt9Ca, 37CI(n, ri 8CI, 23Na(n, r)24Na, I H(n, r)2H and 14N (n, p) 14C. The dominant damaging effects result from the neutron activation of nitrogen atoms. The processes that

contribute to the dose from this reaction are the production of protons, recoils and decay of the 14C atoms.

2.6.2

Gamma Dose

The dose delivered by the gamma rays from the neutron reactions with hydrogen, chlorine and sodium is insignificant, because the hand has a thin layer of soft tissue and rather small and thin bones. This means almost all of the

gamma rays will escape from the hand before making energy deposition. Gamma rays have the least radiation weighting factor with a value of 1. The dose from the decay of the carbon and sodium atoms is negligible compared with the dose

36

deposited by the protons. It should be noted that the dose from thermal neutrons comes from a mixture of low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) gamma and high LET protons and 14Crecoils LET types of radiation.

2.6.3

Dosimetry using Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC)

The total dose equivalent received from both neutrons and photons by humans during the irradiation procedure has been estimated by the trace element analysis group at McMaster University by employing a tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) (Aslam et ai., 2003). Due to its severe limitations to provide accurate neutron quality factors at the low neutron energies employed in these measurements, a Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation code, MCNP5, was used to estimate the neutron quality factors (Aslam et ai., 2006). The

calculated neutron quality factors and the TEPC measured neutron and gamma doses would give an estimate of the local and the average dose equivalent delivered to a human hand during this diagnostic irradiation procedure.

The dose equivalent received by a subject during an irradiation procedure
IS

an important control for IVNAA measurements.

The radiation dose was

therefore kept as low as possible, consistent with the previously assessed

37

statistical precision requirements of the measurement. The dose equivalent to the hand during 3 min of irradiation at proton energy Ep = 2.00 MeV and with a beam current of 100
~A,

measured using the TEPC was 17.6 mSv ((Aslam et a!.,

2006)). A neutron quality factor of 13 was used for this purpose. The gamma dose contributes to approximately 13 % of the local dose equivalent applied to the hand. Further· details of dosimetric measurements are available in literature

(Aslam et aI, 2003; Byun et aI, 2007).

Chapter III Phantom Studies

3.1

Preparation of Hand Phantoms

Human hand bone consists primarily of cortical bone. Al dissolved hand bone phantoms were prepared using compounds of the elements AI, Ca, Na, Mg and CI according to the ICRP 23 (1975) Reference Man cortical bone composition.

The elemental composition of the hand bone is presented in Table (1). Other elements like phosphorus and potassium are also present in the hand bone. The energy of the produced neutrons in IVNAA is not greater than 1.95 MeV to produce 28AI from the interfering 31 p (n, a)
28A l.

Either because of the negligible

cross-section at thermal neutron energies or negligible amount of the element in the biological sample, the induced activity of P and K is considered negligible when compared to those presented in Table (1). Such elements were not added to create the phantom.

Calcium nitrate [Ca(N03)2.4H20], sodium chloride (NaCI) , ammonium chloride (N&CI), magnesium nitrate [Mg(N03)2.6H20] and varying amounts of aluminum nitrate [Ah(N03)] were selected due to their excellent solubility in water. All these compounds were dissolved in distilled water in 250 cm3

cylindrical Nalgene bottles. The concentrations of Al in the phantoms ranged from 0 to 19.9 mg with 14.9 g of Ca in all of them, thus corresponding to concentration within the range of 0 to 1,335.6 Il-g Al per gram of Ca. The

concentration of Al in the Reference man for human hand bone is estimated to be 0.3-0.4 mg [20-27 Il-g Al/g Cal

The bone phantoms used in this study are cylindrical in shape and all the elements of interest including Al and Ca are homogenously distributed throughout the entire volume of each bone phantom. Its volume was chosen to represent the volume of a typical hand including palm and fingers. Thus the number density, nr, of all the major and minor elements present in the phantom, with the exception

40

!

of AI, is the same as that in the cortical bone of Reference man. Recall that phantoms with different concentration of AI are needed to obtain the calibration line.

The rate of production of the corresponding radioisotopes as a result of thermal neutron activation of the phantom depends on the number density (nT), neutron capture reaction cross-section (a), and the incident neutron flux (l/J). The neutron cross-section (a) is independent of the shape or dimensions of the phantom as well as the number density. However, the neutrons flux (l/J) is

dependent on the dimensions of the phantom or hand.

The thermal neutron flux depends on' neutron energy which occurs as a result of neutron interaction with tissue. A slight non-uniformity «20%) in the spatial distribution of l/J along the lateral direction may cause a difference in the activation of the elements of interest. This is expected to be compensated by the larger dimensions of the phantom in the transverse direction along the beam since

A comparison of a human hand spectrum with that of an Al hand phantom under identical conditions of irradiation and counting is shown in figure (4). This figure demonstrates that the chemical composition of the hand phantom accounts for all significant radioactive nuclides, which are produced as a result of the neutron activation of the human hand.

Preliminary Phantom Studies using an Array of Eight 41t NaI(TI) Detectors

An important step of this work was to determine the sensitivity of the
developed bone Al IVNAA techniques using different running parameters and hand phantoms. The experimental set up used for the preliminary phantom studies included the following: · · High current Tandetron Accelerator as the neutron source; The new irradiation/shielding cavity inside where the phantoms are placed for neutron activation; · · The 4n detection system; Marquardt Method of analysis.

At first, the set of phantoms were neutron activated for 3 minutes using a proton beam of energy 2.00 MeV and proton beam current of 100
~A.

The

accompanied radiation dose to the hand was 17.6 mSv as measured using the TEPC. The phantoms, after irradiation in the cavity, were transferred to the

detection system within 35 seconds and counted for 10 minutes. The spectra were then analyzed using the Marquardt method and the calibration lines for Al were constructed. The slope of the calibration line represents the sensitivity of the

technique to measure Al and the MDL values were then calculated as described

43

before. Phantom activation with the same running parameters was repeated three times, and, at each time, the sensitivity as well as the average MD L were determined to compare different experimental conditions.

The irradiation time of 3 minutes was found not to be appropriate for measuring AI, as its half life is 2.25 minutes. The amount of 28Al that will remain after an irradiation of 3 minutes is about 60% of the total, and this amount will be greater if the irradiation time decreases. The expression for a neutron activation

A is the radioactivity; nT is the number density of neutrons; q> is the neutron flux; () is the neutron cross-section; A is the decay constant; t is the irradiation time; T is the transfer time.

Since neutron flux is directly proportional to the proton beam current, a reduction in irradiation time requires a corresponding increase in proton beam current. For instance, if the current is increased by a factor of 2 (from 100 to 200
IlA) or if the flux is doubled, i.e., 2q>, then the irradiation time has to be halved (i.e.,
t12 =90 seconds) if the proton beam energy and number density remains the same.

44

This would enhance the radioactivity of 28AI, and thus increase the sensitivity and performance of the system.

The phantoms were neutron activated with currents from 100 to 400 JlA with a corresponding decrease in the irradiation time from 180 seconds to 45 seconds. The other irradiation parameters like proton beam energy, hand

radiation dose, transfer time, and counting time were kept constant at 2 MeV, 17.6 mSv, 35 seconds and 10 minutes respectively.

Results of Preliminary Phantom Study

Figure (5) depicts the calibration curve obtained for the set of Al phantoms with the following irradiation parameters: 100 JlA current, 180 s irradiation time, proton energy of 2 MeV, transfer time of 35 s, and 600 s of counting. The MDL achieved was 0.20 mg of AI. Two other different sets of phantoms with the same composition were also neutron activated under same irradiation parameters and the corresponding MDL values were estimated. The average MDL of the three sets of measurements was found to be 0.22 mg of AI, as shown in Table 2. The measured levels of Al in hand bone of a healthy person are in the range 0.3 - 0.4 mg Al (ICRP 23, 1975). Therefore the MDL obtained in these preliminary

45

phantom measurements was well below the ICRP range, and the application of the technique of IVNAA was considered feasible for in vivo human studies.

FIGURE 5: Calibration curve obtained from the measurements of Al hand phantoms. A hand phantom MDL of 0.20 mg of Al was achieved.

However, a possible improvement in the MDL value was investigated to further improve the sensitivity of the technique. Table (2) represents the values of

average MDL achieved with an increase in proton beam current and corresponding decrease in irradiation time. A different protocol was also

included, where a proton beam current of 400 JlA with an irradiation time of 3

46

parameters like transfer time and cooling time were kept constant. The radiation dose associated with this latter irradiation protocol was drastically reduced from 17.6 mSv to 5.1 mSv. The resulting MDL (Table 2) was comparable to that achieved for 100 JlA current, 2 MeV energy, 3 minutes of irradiation and a 17.6 mSv radiation dose.

One of the important results achieved in this preliminary phantom study is the improvement of MDL from 0.22 mg to 0.157 mg by increasing the proton beam current from 100 Jl A to 300 JlA and decreasing irradiation time from 3 to 1 minute.

Table (3) shows a comparison of MDLs and figures of merit (FOM) of IVNAA obtained by different research groups until today. As can be seen, the present research achieved a FOM of 0.92 which is lower than that reported by Byun et a!., 2006, and Ellis et a!., 1988. Further improvement in FOM could be achieved by placing the detection system closer to the irradiation cavity with a shield around it, which would decrease the transfer time to 35 s and thus reduce the FOM to below 1.

All average MD L calculated from this preliminary work are well below the values presented in the reported studies in the literature and the estimated normal concentrations from ICRP 23. Therefore, it was concluded that the

technique of IVNAA could be tested in an in vivo human study, especially on subjects with high bone Al concentration. In order to find the range of normal

values of the amount of Al present in human bone, a pilot in vivo study was conducted involving population living in Southern Ontario. This in vivo study is discussed in the following chapter.

In Vivo Human Studies

4.1

In Vivo Human Studies

The first human hand measurements designed to test the described bone Al IVNAA were conducted in 2007. Prior to these measurements, the in vivo study was approved by the research ethics boards of both Ryerson and McMaster Universities. The subjects were chosen from a local healthy population without exposure to Al through occupation or medical treatment. They were requested to sign a consent form which also gave them the option to withdraw from the studies at any time. Eighteen healthy male volunteers with a mean age of (51.8±13.1) years in the range of25 -74 years participated in the study.

During the measurements, each subject was provided a chair to sit on and was asked to insert their left arm into the opening of the irradiation/shielding cavity (Figure 6) for neutron activation by the Tandetron accelerator. The hand was

positioned with the open palm facing the neutron source (i.e. the accelerator target). The preference of the open palm to fist position was to ensure a more homogeneous dose distribution. The fist position adds an air gap between the fingers and inside

50

of the palm, which can result in an inhomogeneous dose distribution. The facility is designed such that it irradiates neutrons to the entire hand which includes the fingers and the palm. The arm was tightly bound with a water sleeve to provide sufficient radiation protection to the rest of the body. It also restricts the motion of the arm. For comfort, the water sleeve could be adjusted around the different

length and thickness of human arms. Each volunteer was given a direct-reading electronic dosimeter for personal monitoring of radiation dose to the rest of the body during the hand irradiation.

FIGURE 6. Human subject hand irradiation at MAL for NNAA measurements.

The irradiation parameters used for this in vivo measurement of Al in human hands were chosen to· be the same as one of those used in the IVNAA study with phantoms. They were: 3 minutes of irradiation at 2MeV proton energy and 100 J.lA

51

proton current; counting time of 10 minutes.

The average time taken by the

subjects to transfer fro.m the irradiation facility to the detection system was 105 seconds. Since this in vivo study is a side study of Mn study conducted at

McMaster University, these parameters were approved by the ethics board.

The radiation· dose used for the IVNAA technique was measured using the Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) and was kept as low as possible according to the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle. The

equivalent dose to a subject's hand was measured to be 17.6 mSv with an estimated total effective dose to the body of 14.4 IlSv.

4.2

Calibration Using Hand Phantoms

The calibration curves used for the in vivo human measurements of Al and Ca are illustrated in the Figures 7a and 7b. The only deviation from the previous (phantom) protocol for the in vivo measurements was for transfer time which here was taken to be 105 seconds. The irradiation and transfer time was corrected to obtain the ratio of amounts of AI. For Ca, phantoms with varying amounts of Ca in the range of 11.6 to 19.6 g and fixed amount of other elements

---'~'-"Yt~en from ICRP were irradiated and counted under similar conditions as used for
AI. For Ca, it was. suitable to use the same calibration line as the one used for the

52

manganese study. The slopes of the calibration lines were then used to find the amount of elements obtained from the counts under the respective .peaks. The irradiation and transfer times were corrected to obtain the ratio of amounts of Al to that of Ca.

The MDL achieved was 0.29 mg, for a 100 JlA proton current set up with 3 minutes of irradiation at 2MeV proton energy, a counting time of 10 minutes and a transfer time of 105 seconds.
I

Recall that the MDL is

conventionally estimated as twice the uncertainty of zero Al content divided by

~

,

Iii II:,

the slope of the calibration line. The ratio of Al to Ca was taken as an index of elevated Al levels per unit bone mass. Moreover, the fluctuations in the amounts of Al activated due to variations of the thermal neutron flux, size/shape or positioning of hands are corrected by calcium normalization. The estimated level of Ca in hand bone was taken as 14.9 g according to the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) Reference Man (ICRP 23, 1975). Each Al dissolved hand phantom contained of 14.9 g of Ca. In phantom studies the ratio of AI/Ca was found by dividing the amount of detected Al by 14.9 g of Ca and the phantom MDL was determined to be 19.5±1.5 Jlg AI/g Ca. Since the expected levels of Al in the hand bone of a healthy person are in the range from 20 to 27 Jlg AI/g Ca [0.3 - 0.4 mg AI] (ICRP 23, 1975), the technique yields the MDL within the range of the expected levels in hand bones.

Data Analysis and Results

Marquardt. analysis was used for in vivo human measurements to determine the amount of Al and Ca present in the hand bone. Figure 8 illustrates the distribution of these element ratios present in the hands of the participants of

55

this study. The hand bone AI concentration ranged from -9.6±11.6 to 60.3±10.4 Ilg Al/g Ca. The error estimates have a confidence level of68% (la).

In order to estimate a value for the population as a

whole~

the inverse

variance weighted mean can be used. This gives a value of 27.9±3.3 Ilg AI/g Ca. The values of the hand bone Al levels ranged from -0.14±0.16 to 1.2±0.20 Illg with a mean of0.47±0.29 mg AI. The mean bone calcium level was 16.9±3.20 g Ca, within the range from 10.9±0.01 to 22.3±0.00 g. The average relative

standard error in AlICa was expected to be 50%. However, the relative error in three measurements_was found to be larger than 50%, which was caused primarily because of gain shifts in the detectors during the measurements, and the data extraction methodology used.

As shown in figure 8, the distribution of AI/Ca ratio shows that the majority of data points are above the present phantom detection limit of the technique. The hand bone Al levels of almost all subjects are within the

uncertainty and, close to the system's detectable limit. However, the subject numbered 18 not only had an AI/Ca ratio below the detection limit but also exhibited a negative value (which is zero within the uncertainty). Even though thls negative value for the AI/Ca ratio is not physiologically possible, it is acceptable from the statistical point of view.

56

The presence of negative values for AlICa ratio are primarily due to the use of basic statistical processes of radiation detection and the fact that the achieved detection limit is close to zero. This phenomenon is often observed in other branches of analytical sciences (Analytical Methods Committee, 2001). McNeill and colleagues (1999) also reported negative values in the in vivo measurement of lead content for very low concentrations of lead in bone.

Two of the volunteers participating in this study were not included in the data set displayed in Figure 8, due to problems during their hand activation. One volunteer had a very short arm and could not correctly place his hand inside the irradiation/shielding cavity. Therefore, only part of the palm (and bone) was

activated. In this case the observed hand levels of Al and Ca were O.70±0.27 mg and only 7.29±O.Ol g respectively. The hand activation of the second volunteer was stopped before the completion of the 3 minutes of irradiation due to technical difficulties. The Al and Ca levels in this case were O.15±0.29 mg and only

7.41±O.Ol g, respectively. Once the calcium normalization was applied, the two

measurements presented an AlICa ratio of 96.0±36.4 and 20.5±39.2 Ilg AI/g Ca. These measurements show significantly higher uncertainties when compared to the measurements of the other volunteers. Thus it was suggested to exclude these two cases from any further data analysis.

4.4

Comparison with Other Studies

It is difficult to directly compare the results for AI/Ca obtained in this

study with other similar studies reported in the literature, due to the differences in
.·1}

tIie~bone sites, bone types, and health conditions of the human subjects. However,

it is interesting to note that the AI/Ca in bone measured in this study is within the

58

ranges of the concentration of AlICa in bones of human subjects reported in other studies (Ellis et aI., 1988; Wyatt et aI., 1993), using the IVNAA technique. Wyatt and colleagues have measured the amount of Al in 7 dialysis patients in the range of -42 to 518 Jlg AI/gCa. The comparable results of this in vivo study with reported studies demonstrates its potential in the monitoring of Al levels in the human bone of exposed population.

Contrary to two in vivo studies cited above, there are several in vitro studies available in literature that provide the bone aluminum values in autopsy and biopsy samples. For example, Scancar and colleagues (Scancar et al., 2000) reported the amount of aluminum detected in iliac crest samples taken at the autopsy of 12 healthy subjects. The ratio of Al to Ca in these subjects ranged from 21 to 88 JlgAI/gCa. In the same study, the authors reported the bone

aluminum levels from the biopsies of 6 dialysis patients, ranging from 51 to 138 JlgAI/gCa. Similarly, Hongve and colleagues (Hongve et al., 1996) found Al concentrations in autopsy samples of a non-exposed population ranging from 0.5 5.8 mg AI/kg ash weight, while increased Al levels ranging from 16.8 to 18.0 mg AI/kg ash weight were found in the samples of a group of dialysis patients. If one takes bone ash to be 40% Ca by mass, these become 1.25 - 14.5 JlgAI/gCa for the non-exposed group and 42 to 45 JlgAlI gCa for the dialysis patients.

59

--------------...~-:l!, .1 12

This shows that the IVNAA technique described here would allow the monitoring of normal Al levels in the human hand bone if the sensitivity of the technique can be improved. Furthermore, the measured values are comparable to both the in vivo and in-vitro values reported in the literature.

4.5

Conclusions of In Vivo Human Studies

The application of the IVNAA technique as a clinical diagnostic tool is possible only if the technique is able to measure the elevated levels of Al in clinically and occupationally exposed subjects as well as the levels of AI present in a non;.exposed population. Since some of the human measurements obtained in this study are below the detection limit, the present technique has some limitation as how reliably it can estimate the hand bone Al reference values. The negative values and the values below the detection limit, thus stipulate a need to improve the sensitivity of the bone Al IVNAA technique which will be discussed in the following chapters of this work.

On the other hand, the majority of human AVCa levels are above or close to the detection limit, clearly presenting the potential of the described technique to

~::=:::"'''\:b~ extended to~a larger group of subjects, especially for the measurement of Al
loads expected in the' hand bone of dialysis patients.

60

Furthermore, according to ICRP 23 reference data, the values of aluminum and calcium result in an Al/Ca ratio of 20 to 27 Jlg Al/g Ca. The mean hand bone aluminum concentration of (27.9±3.3) JlgAl/g Ca obtained in this work is therefore comparable to the reference value of20 - 27 JlgAl/gCa for human hand bone.

One of the objectives of the human studies is also to verify whether the composition of phantoms
devel~ped

for in vivo studies is adequate by comparing

.the MDLs. The doubled median value of the uncertainties was used as a measure of the precision of the in vivo bone Al technique (Studinski et ai., 2006). This resulted in an in vivo detectable limit in the order of (28.0±6.6) JlgAI/gCa for the hand bone. The in vivo MDL calculated is then slightly greater than that of the hand phantoms [(19.5±1.5) JlgAI/gCa], which demonstrates that there is greater variability in the human measurements than there is with the phantoms and justifies the use of the new sets of hand phantoms developed for this study. Lastly, the in vivo MDL of the work presented here is promising and slightly improved when compared to the best previously reported detection limits obtained using IVNAA of the hand (see Table 3, Chapter 3).

Chapter V
Optimization of the Bone Aluminum IVNAA technique

5.1

Need to Optimize the Technique ofIVNAA

In vivo measurements of Al in non-exposed subjects at MAL have

reported some All Ca values that are below or within the present detection limit, which demonstrated that the developed technique has some limitations to A means to improve the

reliably estimate hand bone Al reference values.

sensitivity of the bone Al IVNAA technique is therefore considered necessary (Chapter IV). Strategies to improve the detection limit of in vivo hand bone Al levels are considered in this chapter and contrasted with those measuring approaches previously described (Chapter III).

The fIrst step to be taken is to improve the detection system (section 5.2) by replacing and/or adding new detectors, which was followed by the investigation of which irradiation parameters would improve the sensitivity of bone Al IVNAA technique. Two approaches to improve the detection limit were

investigated in this study: 1) without change in the hand dose of less than 20 mSv and 2) with increase of the hand dose up to 50 mSv.

62

5.2

Enhanced Detection System

The two NaI detectors which were unstable and had poor resolution were replaced with new detectors of same size. A new, smaller detector has also been added to the rear end of the system to further approach the 41t geometry.

The improvement in resolution of the new system was tested using hand phantoms. A comparison of the resolution of the spectra using the original and enhanced detection system is shown in figures (9a) and (9b). Figure (9a)

illustrates part of the spectrum of 19.9 mg Al phantom containing Na, CI and Al peaks; generated using the upgraded detection system, while figure (9b) illustrates the same spectrum generated by the original detection system. Due to the

improved system resolution and geometry, the Al and CI peaks are better resolved using the enhanced detection system. A better resolution leads to a better system sensitivity as experimentally tested and presented in the next section.

Phantom Studies with the Hand Dose Lower than 20 mSv

Since the Tandetron Accelerator is capable of delivering high proton beam currents, the irradiation time could be adjusted, while increasing proton currents accordingly to maintain a constant equivalent dose. This leads to an improved system sensitivity due to shorter activation time compared to the half-life of 28 Al nuclei. For example, if the irradiation time is reduced to 90 seconds and the

65

proton beam current increased to 200 JlA, keeping constant the proton beam energy, then the number of 28Al nuclei still present at the end of the irradiation period will increase. Similarly by reducing the length of irradiation from 180 seconds to 45 seconds and increasing the proton beam current from 100 JlA to 400 JlA at 2 MeV proton energy, the counts in the AI peak will increase by the factor of 2.25 resulting in an improvement of the MDL.

With the new enhanced detection system, the initial experiments utilized the same set of phantoms used in the previous studies (Section 3.1)· with the original detection system. They were neutron activated for 3 minutes using a proton energy of 2.00 MeV and proton beam current of 100 f-lA to solely compare the improvement with the enhanced detection system. At this point, a transfer time of 30 s was used, followed by a counting time of 600 s.

Using the same method of data analysis (please refer to section 2.5), a linear regression line was constructed by plotting the area under Al peaks against the amount of Al in each phantom. The newly achieved MDL, 0.16 mg represents an improvement of approximately 20% when compared to the MDL of 0.22 mg obtained with the original detection system and similar protocols except for the

tr~sfer time of30 seconds (Table 4).

66

~

Next, different irradiation parameters were tested. Thus the experiments were repeated for higher proton beam currents and corresponding decrease in irradiation times. Table (4) depicts the MDL obtained for different proton beam currents and irradiation times. For comparison, the last column of the table

represents the MDL achieved for phantoms using the original detection system and the transfer time of 35 seconds.

Consistent improvement in the system's MDL was observed as the proton current was increased, reaching the MDL of o. 12 mg of Al accompanied with 17.6 mSv of the hand dose.

Phantom Studies with the Hand Dose Lower than 50 mSv

Another irradiation protocol adopted for the optimization of the bone AI IVNAA technique was to increase the proton beam current to 400 JlA and with an irradiation time of 2 minutes and proton beam energy of 2 MeV. The transfer time of 30 seconds and 600 seconds counting period was adopted as before. The irradiation dose associated with this protocol was calculated to be 46.9 mSv. Hand doses up to 50 mSv can be utilized for an IVNAA technique since it has been approved by the Ryerson (Approval # 2008 099) and McMaster (Approval # 08 255) Research Boards in anticipation of the next human study. The 50 mSv radiation dose for one measurement corresponds to an effective dose of 40 JlSv. This can be compared to the annual natural background radiation dose in North America which is about 3000 JlSv/year. So, a bone aluminum measurement with a 50 mSv hand dose gives the same effective dose to an adult as about 5 days of natural background radiation.

Since the MD L is proportional to the square root of hand dose, the increase of hand dose from 17.6 mSv to 46.9 mSv (2.66 times) along with higher beam currents and reduced irradiation time yields a reduction of the detection limit of == .J2.66. The experimentally achieved MDL for this protocol with an irradiation dose of 46.9 mSv was 0.103 mg of Al (Table 4).

Optimization of the Bone Aluminum IVNAA Technique: Discussion

This chapter suggests different procedures to optimize the technique of IVNAA to achieve better performance and sensitivity in terms of MDL. The in
vivo measurements of Al in hand phantoms were carried out using the enhanced
4n detection system along with Tandetron accelerator, irradiation/shielding cavity

and Marquardt data analysis.

The irradiation/counting protocol used for these experiments consisted at first of 180 s irradiation and 100 flA proton beam current with 30 s transfer and 600 s counting time, for 2 MeV proton beam energy and 17.6 mSv hand dose. The MDL achieved with this protocol was 0.16 mg AI. Later the irradiation time was decreased to 90 s with an increase of beam current to 200 flA with the other irradiation parameters remaining constant. The number of
28 Al

nuclei that

remained after 90 seconds of irradiation should be greater than that remained after 180 seconds of irradiation. From the neutron activation equation A = N<pa(1-e-At) e-AT (eqn 3.1) it is clear that the detection limit should be increased by a factor of 1.11. The detection limit achi eved in the experiment with the above protocol was 0.15 mg of Al which shows an improvement of MDL by afactor of 1.10. The

experiment was repeated by increasing the proton beam currents to 300 and 400 JlA with decrease in the irradiation times to 60 and 45 s respectively. The MDLs

69

achieved were 0.14 and 0.12 mg of Al which correspond to improvement factors of 1.15 and 1.29 respectively.

The MDL achieved with the enhanced detection system was found to have improved when compared to that obtained with the original system. Consistent improvement in the MDL was experimentally achieved by increasing the proton current and simultaneously decreasing the irradiation time. This approach was followed by the dose optimization to achieve even better MDL.
It was

concluded, that the optimal parameters for the Tandetron accelerator are: 400 JlA proton beam current with 2 minutes irradiation time at 2 MeV proton beam energy, with a radiation hand dose of 46.9 mSv. As the MDL depends on the square root of the dose, the increase of the dose from 17.6 mSv to 46.9 mSv should reduce the detection limit by a factor of the square root of 2.66 (46.9/17.6

= 2.66). Thus, the detection limit should improve by a factor of 1.63.

The

experimental MDL achieved by applying these parameters wasO.10.mg of AI, an improvement by a factor of 1.56.

The MDL of 0.10 mg Al achieved is well below the predicted normal concentration of Al in the hand of 0.3-0.4 mg Al (ICRP 23, 1975). Therefore, it is concluded that the developed protocol is suitable for detecting concentration of Al in both healthy subjects as well as in patients with expected higher concentration

70

of this element. In conclusion, the protocol parameters of 2MeV proton energy with 400 JlA proton current, 120 seconds of irradiation time and 30 seconds of transfer time should be used in the future in vivo human studies.

Quantification of Aluminum in Human Bone with Neutron Activation Analysis

6.1

Summary and Discussion

The current medical field requires an acceptable diagnostic technique that can easily identify patients at increased risk of developing. Al induced bone diseases. In the clinical environment the amount of Al in bone, which provides information about a cumulative exposure to the element, is currently estimated through biopsy of iliac crest bone. Limitations of bone biopsy include the fact that it is an invasive and painful technique. Bone biopsy cannot be repeated over time, and therefore cannot be used to follow a patient's Al loads. Furthermore, a biopsy is typically of a small mass and it therefore may not be representative of the bone Al levels. For all these reasons, bone biopsy is not a satisfactory method to measure bone Al levels, and interest has arisen to develop a method to measure this element in vivo, non invasively. An ideal method of this kind would be valuable in the determination of bone Al concentration over time. Furthermore, . the knowledge of the bone Al concentration, incorporation and retention during dialysis treatment, for example, would also help to establish the onset of Al

72

induced bone disorders in this group of patients. The aim of this study is to further develop a technique using IVNAA for the measurement of bone Al that would be suitable for general use in hospitals.

The IVNAA facilities at McMaster University have been in use for the analysis of many trace elements. This readily available facility was successfully used for this application as well. The bone IVNAA technique has been under development for Al and Mn measurements in human hand bones at McMaster University for the last two decades. This work presents the first pilot in vivo human measurements of Al stored in the hand bone carried out on the population living in Southern Ontario, Canada. While it relies on previously reported work done at McMaster Accelerator Laboratory, it represents significant progress in developing a diagnostic tool suitable for monitoring bone Al in human skeleton.

A new generation of hand bone phantoms was built that closely resemble the human bone composition and spectra, .and thus provide meaningful calibration of the technique. Furthermore, this study utilizes for the first time, a high current Tandetron .accelerator and irradiation/shielding cavity designed for measurements of humans' extremities. Although the Tandetron has the ability to provide

significantly higher proton currents (up to 1 rnA), that was not presently exploited.

73

The enhanced 4n detection system was an added bonus for the improvement of the sensitivity of the technique that is reported in this work.

The ratio of AI and Ca masses in hand bone is used as a clinical indicator of bone aluminium levels. This is useful in comparing Al levels stored in the bone of healthy and exposed populations. For example, high Al levels in dialysis patients need to be regularly monitored to evaluate the side effects of Al intoxication that accompanies this treatment. Calcium normalization is usually adopted in the

IVNAA technique because of the dependence of the technique's sensitivity on thermal neutron flux and the positioning of the hand upon irradiation. It reduces the uncertainties in the measurements of counting statistics, size and shape of the hand, transfer time, the data extraction methodology, and any gain shifts in the detector during the measurements.

Thus Ca normalisation improves sensitivity of the bone Al IVNAA technique. It also provides clinically relevant results suitable for regular monitoring of the Al loads, namely an index of elevated Al levels per unit bone mass.

This work presents the results of the first human bone Al measurements
--c-~----:~~~ing the present developed IVNAA technique. The mean hand bone aluminum

concentration of (27.9±3.3) IlgAlIgCa, ranging from -9.6 to 60.3 Ilg AI/g Ca was

74

measured in eighteen healthy volunteers participating in the in vivo human study. The variability in Al/Ca ratio in different subjects is not well established. This range of values is generally attributed to the differences in the bone sites, size and shape, age, lifestyle, dietary habits and demographic origin (Takata et aI., 2005). Despite these differences, the results were compared favourably to both in vitro and

in vivo Al bone values available in the literature, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the developed, painless, non-invasive diagnostic tool described here. However, the first human data also point in a direction of need to further decrease the detection limit of the technique.

The present study investigates, therefore, different approaches to improve the sensitivity of this diagnostic tool. The sensitivity of the technique was

investigated by using a higher dose rate, optimization of the irradiation parameters and greater detection efficiency. After taking into consideration several different approaches, it is suggested that a desirable detection limit for non-exposed subj ects can be achieved by increasing the proton current, and thus increasing the accompanied effective dose of each measurement. The running parameters of 2 MeV proton beam energy, proton current of 400JlA, and 120 seconds of irradiation and 30 seconds transfer time provide the detection limit of 0.10 mg of Al accompanied with less than 50 mSv equivalent dose. The developed protocol

seems sufficiently sensitive to detect the low levels of Al found in normal subj ects

75

as well as screening patients with elevated levels of bone AI. However, it should be tested in in vivo human studies expected in the future.

The use of the spectral decomposition method (Comsa et aI., 2004) has been reported by the trace element analysis group at McMaster University as an advanced 'Y-ray spectrum analysis when compared to the non-linear fitting method used in this study. The spectral decomposition method provided an improvement in MD L when applied to the hand phantoms. It did not demonstrate similar

improvement when applied to the human, in vivo spectra. One of the explanations might be that the human spectra have more noise than the phantom spectra, due to the shape/size of hand, presence of the overlying soft tissue and motion of volunteers.

6.2

Proposals for Future Research

Approval has been obtained from the Ryerson and McMaster Research Ethics Boards to perform the next human studies to measure Al in dialysis patients and occupationally exposed subjects. The goal of this study is to

investigate whether Al levels in bone could serve as a biomarker of exposure and . a means of monitoring exposed populations to this toxic element. This

76

anticipated study will also provide a platform to test a new protocol to lower the detection limit developed in this work.

More research should be done to fmd a possible correlation between bone Al values by measuring different types of bones and sites. The distribution of Al is not expected to be homogeneous throughout the human skeleton. Thus,

measurements of other extremities with cortical and trabecular bone composition should be considered in further studies. These should be extended to other

peripheral sites like foot bone, and accompanied with alterations in the irradiation/shielding cavity and detection facilities to accommodate measurement of this site. Another proposed future research is to find a way to correlate

between the Al levels in the hand bone and human brain; this could answer many controversies regarding the relationship between Al andAlzheimer's disease.

Besides the use of an enhanced detection system that lowers the MDL, it is expected that future work should explore the construction of a detection room for human measurements close to the accelerator irradiation facility. This would

reduce the time taken by the subjects or phantoms to move from the irradiation/shielding cavity to the detection room and thus improve the sensitivity of the presented technique. Clearly, the detection facility should have appropriate neutron/gamma shielding to avoid activation of detectors.

77

An Anticoincidence mode of detection for Al measurements should be also investigated in the near future. It has been reported that a reduction in the continuum level of the overlapping AI-CI occurs with anticoincidence techniques

(Byun et al., 2006).

Even if the counting rate of the

28AI

peak is reduced

compared to that in the direct mode detection used in this work, the ratio of the Al peak to the CI interfering peak would be improved considerably. result in a better MDL. This could

6.3

Final Remarks

For clinical in vivo measurements of Al detection in humans, it is necessary to test the suggested protocol in this work, which should lead to a lower

in vivo minimum detectable limit (MDL), thus opening up a broad field of
research that may improve our knowledge about Al health effects, its metabolism and besides the monitoring of the Al levels from occupational and clinical exposure.
