Abstract
Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are used in bridge decks to overcome the problem of corrosion of steel bars and concrete spalling. However, design guidelines for joints between GFRPreinforced precast deck panels supported over girders for accelerated bridge replacement is as yet unavailable. The proposed research investigates the use of GFRP bars in the closure strip between jointed precast deck panels, which is filled with ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). Four different bar splice lengths in the joint were considered in this study, namely: 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, with bar splice spacing taken as 0, 75 and 100 mm. 27 specimens were constructed and tested to-collapse to determine their structural behavior and load carrying capacity. Correlation between experimental findings and available design equations for moment and shear capacities was conducted, leading to recommendations for the use of the proposed joints between precast deck panels in slab-on-girder bridges.

Chapter I Introduction
1.1 Introduction

Bridges are a major component of any infrastructure, acting as critical links in most of the road networks and railways, connecting cities and countries and securing a critical mean of transportation of goods and people from place to another. Such vital asset requires routine inspection, maintenance and as problems arise, the demand for research, innovation and development of new materials, structural components, applications, and construction methods increase. In Canada, severe weather fluctuations in winter times result in freezing and thawing of structural members and the use of deicing salts makes the expansive corrosion of steel reinforcement in bridge deck slabs a major issue. This leads to reduction in the capacity and the life expectancy of bridges, costly routine maintenance and in some cases replacement of the bridge or the severely deteriorated components. From engineering and economic perspectives, for the process of replacing the deteriorated bridge or some of its components to be effective, it should have a minimal impact on the traffic. Also, it should incorporate innovative materials and construction techniques that will limit or minimize the effect of deicing salt used in winter times in Canada. The federal highway administration (FHWA) defines accelerated bridge construction (ABC) as making use of innovative planning, design, materials, and construction methods in a safe and cost-effective manner to reduce the onsite construction time that occurs when building new bridges or replacing and rehabilitating existing bridges. ABC results in improved site constructability, total project delivery time and work zone safety for travelling public. It also reduces the impact on traffic, and the weather-related time delays, maintaining and/or improving construction quality, and reducing the life cycle costs and

Chapter 1| Introduction

environmental impacts. Prefabricated components can be delivered to site and quickly assembled, and thus they can reduce design and constriction time and cost, minimize forming, minimize lane closure time and/or possibly eliminate the need for a temporary bridge. (Culmo 2009). One of the ABC techniques is the use of prefabricated systems, to minimize the use of the conventional cast in place techniques; a major component of such system which is the focus of this research is the jointed prefabricated deck panels that are supported over either steel or prefabricated precast concrete girders. Figure 1.1(a) depicts a schematic diagram of precast fulldepth deck panels placed transversally over girders. While Fig. 1.1(b) presented the bulb-tee pretentioned girders placed side-by-side over abutments and/or piers and jointed together at the level of the deck slab. 1.2 The significance of this research

Several research studies have been conducted on the behavior of the joint between the precast prefabricated deck panels considering conventional steel reinforcement, epoxy-coated steel bars and GFRP bars. These studies investigated the reinforcement details in the joint such as bent bars, bars with hooked ends, headed- and straight-end bars, combined with different shear key shapes and different joint filling materials, such as non-shrinking grout, high performance concrete (HPC) and ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). Among the materials being proposed and investigated in the jointed precast deck panels, the ribbed-surface GFRP bars and UHPFRC are of a growing interest and focus. The outstanding properties of each of these materials eliminate the durability issues that existed when using steel reinforcement and allow for expansion on accelerated bridge construction practice. However literature survey showed that neither the CHBDC (2014), nor the AASHTO-LRFD (2012), provide guidance of the design of the joints of prefabricated deck slabs reinforced with GFRP and
2

Chapter 1| Introduction

UHPFRC. The significance of the is research is that it addresses the problem of the lack of guidance in design manuals and design standards due to the lack of research data in literature for the behavior of the joints incorporating straight-end, ribbed-surface, GFRP bars and UHPFRC joints. Specifically, the change in joint width and associated bar splice length in the joint and the spacing between spliced bar in the joint has not been investigated before. The proposed experimental program will provide data to assist in obtaining the precast deck slab capacity based on the joint details as affected by (i) joint width and associated bar splice length, and (ii) spacing between spliced bars in the joint. 1.3 Thesis objectives

The objective of this research are: 1- to conduct a parametric study using experimental testing to investigate the behavior of ribbed-surface glass fiber reinforced polymer GFRP bars in the closure strip between jointed precast deck slabs resting over steel or concrete girders. 2- to correlate the experimental findings with the available theoretical capacities of the slab section in moment and shear to examine their applicability. 3- to determine the maximum spacing between girders to be considered to use the developed joints in practice. 1.4 Scope of work

The Jointed deck slabs investigated in this study are one-way slabs utilizing two vertical shear keys, one on each side of the closure strip. GFRP bars in the precast deck slabs are proposed to project with straight ends into the closure strip, which will then be filled with ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). The behavior of GFRP reinforcement in the UHPFRC joint is studied using full-scale tests. The key parameters considered in this study were

3

Chapter 1| Introduction

bar spacing, splice length in the joint and splice bar spacing within the joint. Four different bar splice length were considered, namely: 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm for closure strip widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 mm, respectively. The splice bars were considered (i) lapped with direct contract and non-contacted with spacing of 50, 75 and 100 mm. The mechanics of the anchorage behavior were observed and recorded to evaluate the manner in which the capacity of a straight-end GFRP bars was developed for different splice length and bar spacing. Observations from these tests provided information on the mechanism of stress transfer between lapped bars in the closure strip. 1.5 Thesis layout

The content of this thesis is presented in five chapters. Chapter 1 presents the introduction, research significance, objectives and scope of work. Chapter 2 presented the literature review pertained to the research topic. Chapter 3 presented the experimental program designed to fulfill the objectives of this research. It includes description of test specimens, test setup and test procedure. Chapter 4 presents the experimental findings and test results. Chapter 4 presents the conclusions of this research and recommendations for further investigations.

Chapter II Literature Review
2.1 FRP technology and its use in structural engineering

The use of FRP material in structural applications where first investigated in the 1950s but it was finally considered for structural application in the 1970s, according to the ISIS Manual No. 3 (ISIS Canada 2007). Early works in FRP used in construction and retrofitting of concrete structures in USA, Japan, Canada and Europe was between 1980 and 1990 (Bank, 2006). Starting from the year 1993, the initiation of a series of biannual international symposium with the use of FRP in construction started to take place. And from that time, a dramatic increase in the international interests of the area of FRP in the construction and retrofitting. Since the early 1980's ASCE is publishing a collection of papers about FRP profile sections. Later the ASCE founded "the journal of composites for construction"; which represents the main international archive for reporting on research and development on the FRP in the construction field (Bank, 2006). FRP or Fiber Reinforced Polymer is a composite material composed of a polymer matrix reinforced with Microfibers whether Carbon, Glass or Aramid fibers, with the Carbon and Glass fibers being used more often in structural applications with the latter being widely used for concrete reinforcement as a replacement for conventional and stainless steel reinforcement. CFRP can be found in three four main types A-Glass, E-Glass, C-Glass, S-Glass. The most common in structural applications and least expensive is the E-Glass, having a tensile strength of around 3400 MPa, a density of 2.75 kg/cm3 and a Modulus of elasticity of 75.2 GPa (Bank,2006). The main source of strength in the FRP composite are the fibers having high tensile strength, and so having the fibers in the FRP composite oriented in the same plane of the tensile component of any straining action will better utilize the capacity of the fiber.

Chapter 2| Literature Review

In general, FRP technology can be applied in the structural engineering field in rehabilitation and retrofitting of existing RC structures as Externally Bonded Reinforcement or as a Near Surface Mounted Reinforcement. In addition to its use as an alternative to conventional and stainless steel reinforcement in reinforcing new reinforced concrete structural members (AASHTO, 2009). With the growing need for the use of innovative materials in bridge construction that combines both strength and durability to eliminate the durability problems resulting from the use of steel reinforcement, the FRP and specifically the GFRP reinforcement bars have emerged as an alternative to the steel reinforcement, due to their non-corrosive nature (AASHTO, 2009). Moreover they have better advantage over the conventional and stainless steel as the GFRP is lighter in weight in addition to its higher strength relative to the steel. Although the initial cost of the GFRP reinforcement is higher than steel reinforcement, the long-term cost should be less than that of steel throughout the life span of the structure or the bridge given the higher durability and strength properties that GFRP has over the steel. 2.2 Capacity of GFRP bars reinforced concrete Several design manuals and guidelines have been developed to aid in the design of GFRP reinforced concrete Sections and predict their capacity flexural and shear capacity (ISIS Canada,2007; AASHTO, 2009; CHBDC, 2014).

2.2.1 Flexural capacity of GFRP reinforced concrete For the flexural Capacity of FRP reinforced concrete Sections, Chapter 6 of the ISIS manual No. 3 (ISIS, 2007) presents the design guidelines for reinforcing with FRP, it describes three distinct modes of failure in flexure, Balanced failure, Compression failure and tension failure and it states that the compression failure is more desirable and less violent when compared to the tension failure mode due to the sudden rupture of FRP reinforcement in the tension failure mode For the compression failure mode, the ISIS manual No. 3 presents the following equations for predicting the ultimate moment capacity from the equilibrium of compressive and tensile forces in the concrete compression block and the FRP reinforcement respectively, The equilibrium of forces C and T, should be satisfied yielding the following term C C T T    f  cb, A   A E  ,  E

Both ISIS Canada manula No. 3 and AASHTO guidelines assume the contribution of the compression reinforcement to be negligible.

Research showed that GFRP bars develop a non-linear behavior along its length, the bond strength between GFRP bars and concrete is influenced by the bar diameter compressive strength of concrete, properties of the resin matrix of the bar material and the end anchorage mechanism.

On the other hand, the AASHTO GFRP Bridge Design Guide Specifications for GFRP-Reinforced Concrete Bridge Decks and Traffic Railings (2009) provides in Section 2.12 more detailed guide lines and specifications on the requirement of development and splice lengths of GFRP bars imbedded in concrete, it allows the use of hooks and end anchors provided that the performance is approved after being verified by tests equivalent to ASTM D 3916 it also allows the use of

than or equal to 12d or (9 in) moreover it sets limitations on the tail length and the bend radius to avoid shear failure at the bend. 2.2.4 Splice length CHBDC specifies the splice length of FRP bars in tension to be at least 1.3l and the spacing of the spliced bars shall not exceed 150 mm. On the other hand, the AASHTO guidelines specifies the splice length of FRP bars in tension to be at least 1.3l or 300 mm (12 in) and the spacing of the spliced bars shall not exceed 150 mm (6 in). 2.3 UHPFRC technology Ultra-High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete UHPFRC, also known as Reactive Powder concrete is the latest generation of structural concrete that was first introduced by a French concrete produces in the 1990's having an outstanding fresh and hardened concrete properties, this includes the ease of placement and consolidation with ultra-high early and long term mechanical properties, as well as toughness volume stability, durability, higher flexural and tensile strength and ductility (Graybeal, 2006; Kosmata et al., 2003; Graybeal, 2013; Russell et al., 2013). Its high compressive capacity and high flow-ability as well as low porosity is achieved by optimizing the particle packing and the minimal water content and the use of chemical and mineral admixtures. The durability of the UHPFRC is enhanced by the low porosity which makes it suitable for a wide array of applications especially in the field of precast prefabricated bridge construction. To achieve these properties coarse aggregate is eliminated and only fine particles are used; the grain size distribution should be optimized to densify the mix and improve rheology, moreover a superplasticizer or high range water reducer should be used to improve rheology while maintaining
14

Chapter 2| Literature Review

the W/C as low as 0.2, fibres usually steel or synthetic fibers should be added as a volumetric ratio up to 2% to improve ductility and achieve higher tensile and flexural strength. Further detailed literature survey on the UHPFRC properties is presented in the state of the art report published by FHWA (Russell, 2013). 2.4 Flexural capacity of UHPFRC section Several models have been developed to predict the capacity of fiber reinforced concrete, however all models available are obtained based on fiber reinforced concrete Section with steel bars as the main flexural reinforcement not with GFRP, most of the model are based on the strain compatibility and equilibrium equations. Among these models are the models presented in the ACI report No. ACI 544.4R-88 and the FHWA report number FHWA-HIF-13-032. Sriram et al. (2013) presents a model for predicting the ultimate capacity of UHPC for rectangular members and T-members reinforced with mild steel reinforcing bars Figure 2.1. It assumes a linear stress strain relationship, and recommends the use of a conservative value of fiber pullout strain in design as 0.007 and a corresponding limiting tensile strength of the UHPC to be 8.25MPa, (1.2 ksi) it also mentions that the ultimate compressive strain at the extreme top compression fibers to be 0.0032 having a corresponding compressive strength to be  165MPa (24 ksi). The model approximates the compression stress block to be triangular, and till the neutral axis and the tensile stress of the HPC uniform from and acting approximately from the neutral axis to the extreme tensile fibers. The proposed design procedure uses the equilibrium of the internal forces and the strain compatibility at the ultimate limit state to determine the governing failure mode and from that failure mode, and based on the governing failure mode the neutral axis and moment capacity obtained, the design procedure can be summarized as: 1- Determining the failure mode from equations

2.5 Development length of GFRP bars in UHPFRC Bond strength of UHPFRC and high strength fiber reinforced concrete have been studied by several researchers, (among them Nielsen et al, 1996; Aarup and Jensen, 1998). The behavior of GFRP bars in UHPFRC started to gain more attention more recently, studies were conducted on various GFRP bar types (among them Ametrano, 2011; Graybeal, 2011; Khederzadeh and Sennah, 2013) A more recent study (Sayed Ahmed, 2016) investigated pullout strength of straight-end and headed-end GFRP bars embedded into UHPFRC to determine the required closure strip width to develop bar full strength, the study recommends a bond development length of the straight bars not to be less than 9.5db or 150 mm, whichever is greater. 2.6 Static analysis of concrete deck slabs Section 5 in the CHBDC (2014), states that concrete deck slabs should be designed for both positive and negative moments in the transverse direction and the induced moment in the longitudinal direction shall also be considered in the analysis and design, it provides a simplified

Chapter 2| Literature Review

Several research studies have been conducted on the behavior of the joint between the prefabricated deck slabs, the studies included various types of steel reinforcement, various types of end anchorages of steel reinforcement like straight bars, bet bars u-shaped end bars, in addition to various shear key shapes and geometry, joint width and bar embedment length and splice connection details as well as different types of joint fill materials such as UHPFRC , Cementous grout, epoxy , magnesium ammonium phosphate grout and post tensioning cable grout (NCHRP 2008; Li et al., 2010; NCHRP, 2011). However, fewer studies have been conducted on the joints incorporating UHPFRC and GFRP reinforcement. Culmo (2009) produced a state of the practice report for the FHWA on the Connection Details for Prefabricated Bridge Elements and Systems , the document focuses on the connection details and design considerations up to the date it was written, it includes an introduction on the ABC and connection details and design consideration for the connections of prefabricated elements, Section 2.2 contains the state of practice information on connections between the full depth precast deck slabs. Further literature survey and state of the practice survey could be found elsewhere (PCINER Technical Committee, 2002; Hieber and Wacker, 2005; Badie et al., 2006; Badie and Tadros, 2008; UDOT, 2010; PCI. 2011; Roddenberry, 2012). Li et al. (2010) conducted a study aiming to promote the use of bulb-tee girder system by improving the joint connection details used with this system at the time of the study by proposing and investigating an alternate joint detail to the longitudinal joints with welded steel connectors and grouted shear keys. The proposed joint details were lapped headed reinforcement or lapped welded wire reinforcement. Seven reinforced concrete beam specimens incorporating the proposed joints were evaluated based on flexural capacity, curvature at failure, cracking, deflection, and steel strain. The study resulted in a conclusion that headed bar detail with a 152 mm lap length
20

Chapter 2| Literature Review

was recommended for replacing the current welded steel connector detail as this lap length provided full development of the bars to produce full load capacity and significant ductility. To further improve the joint detail for bulb-tee girders, and facilitate the accelerated bridge construction, and as a continuation to the research conducted by Li et al. (2010), Ma et al. (2012) investigated the performance of the tight bend diameter U-bars as potential alternate reinforcing materials and joint details compared to the headed bar joint proposed by Li et al. (2010). In this study headed bar and U-bar specimens made of stainless steel (SS) and deformed wire reinforcement (DWR) with the same joint detail configurations were tested and compared, then the effect of concrete strengths, bar spacings, and overlap lengths of U-bars (DWR) were also investigated, for moment capacity, cracking at service and failure load, and steel strains. The study found that a 16 mm U-bar detail with a minimum bend diameter of three times the diameter of the bar (3db) can be used to facilitate accelerated bridge construction, as is the U-bar detail using DWR performed better than the headed bar detail in terms of moment capacity and service-level crack widths, moreover, it was observed that the U-bar joint zone is less congested than the headed bar detail, the study recommended that in order to provide adequate ductility without significant loss of strength at the ultimate conditions, the joint overlap length should not be less than 152 mm when using 16 mm joint reinforcement, moreover it recommends the use 13 mm lacer bars in the joint detail and be located at the bearing face of the U-bar as the 13 mm lacer bars were observed to provide restraint to help facilitate anchorage of the U-bar details for the joint zones in flexure.

He et al. (2013) conducted a study to develop a strut-and-tie model (STM) that can be used in the design of previously developed longitudinal joint incorporating tight bend diameter Ubars by Ma et al. (2012). Four joint specimens reinforced with tight bend diameter U-bars that were previously tested under bending were used to validate the proposed STM . the study yielded the development of an STM model that provided conservative and consistent strength predictions for the U-bar joints. Lee and Lee (2015) studied the flexural behavior of precast concrete moment connections incorporating steel bars embedded in UHPFRC, their experimental program consisted of two phases. The first phase was focused on the bonding performance of steel reinforcing bars embedded in the UHPFRC, the performance was evaluated using lap-spliced beam specimens with three different volumes of steel fibers. The second phase, was to study the flexural behavior of the UHPFRC moment connections, the study was conducted on 14 precast concrete beam specimens. The precast connections had a joint width ranging from 250 to 100 mm and included three noncontact splice details: straight bars, 90-degree hooked bars, and U-loop bars. The study showed the remarkable bonding characteristics of UHPFRC, it was also noted that the precast specimens with a joint width larger than 150 mm exhibited flexural behavior equivalent to that of a monolithic concrete beam specimen, moreover the anchorage provided by the hooked bars and Uloop bars did not contribute significantly to the bonding strength. Khalafalla (2014) developed and studied the behavior of Six precast slab joint details between flanges of precast bulb-tee girders incorporating GFRP bars with straight ends, headed ends and L-shaped ends embedded in a non-shrink cement grout or ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) filled closure strip. In this study, 11 actual-size specimens representing the one-way slab system with the proposed joint details, in addition to 5 cast-in-place control specimens tested to
22

Chapter 2| Literature Review

failure to examine the structural adequacy of the proposed joint detail. Moreover, the study included 8 actual-size, GFRP reinforced concrete deck slabs under fatigue load to examine its fatigue life using different schemes of fatigue loading. Khalafalla (2014) found that for deck slab reinforced with the same reinforcement ratio specified in CHBDC, the ultimate load capacity of GFRP-reinforced cast-in-place slabs is about 75% greater than that of a similar slab reinforced with steel bars. It was also observed that closure strip with 125-mm width with projecting headedend or L-shaped GFRP bars filled with UHPC and the closure strip with 200-mm wide joints with projecting L-shaped GFRP bars, filled with non-shrink grout showed about 27% greater load carrying capacity than that of a similar slab reinforced with steel bars. It was also found that headed ends GFRP bars can provide a continuous force transfer in the longitudinal joint for deck bulb-tee bridge systems thus allowing for a reduced closure strip width. Moreover the static and fatigue loading tests for the GFRP reinforced restrained deck slabs with the proposed joints showed a punching shear failure mode. It also concluded that reinforcement ratio specified by CHBDC is adequate to meet the ultimate and fatigue limit state requirements for concrete bridge deck slabs. Moreover, the study compared the experimental results with the available equation in CSA S80612 (2012) and El-Gamal et al. (2005) the comparison showed that these models can predict the punching shear strength of the cast-in-place as well as precast jointed bridge deck slabs reinforced with GFRP-bars with good accuracy. Sayed Ahmed (2016) studied the effect of the joint detail on the capacity of the joint incorporating GFRP bars and UHPFRC joint fill material between deck slab panels made of normal strength concrete and high performance concrete, in this study three joint details were proposed and investigated namely: angle-shape joint, C-shape joint, and zigzag-shape joint. In this study one way slabs were tested by applying concentric and eccentric wheel loading at the joint to expose it
23

Chapter 2| Literature Review

to pure bending and combined bending and shear respectively. The study showed GFRP-reinforced cast-in-place slab showed an ultimate load capacity of was about 15% less than the capacity of a similar slab reinforced with steel bars in accordance with the CHBDC and having the same crosssectional area as the GFRP bars. It also shows that GFRP-reinforced jointed slab with a 200 mm wide joint width with a zigzag-shaped showed a flexural strength that was about 1.4% less than that for a similar cast-in-place slab. Moreover, it was observed that the ultimate load of the jointed slab with a vertical shear key increased by 15% as a result of using eccentric loading rather than the concentric loading at the closure strip. The failure mode in all tested one-way slab specimens was either pure flexural of combined flexural and shear in the NSC panel rather than in the UHPFRC-filled joint or bond failure of GFRP bars embedded into the joint.

Chapter III Experimental Program
3.1 Experimental program and test matrix The proposed experimental program of this research was designed to conduct a parametric study on the joints between prefabricated deck panels incorporating ribbed GFRP straight-end bars imbedded into the joint. The parameters being considered in this study were the bar embedment length and associated joint width, spliced bar spacing, and main bar spacing. This experimental study is composed of 27 one-way slabs in seven groups, namely: a control group of three slabs and 6 groups of four slabs each. The slabs in one group had a fixed spacing of bars in the lap splice and main bar spacing with bar splice length of 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm for closure strip widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 mm, respectively. The slabs were tested under static loading in a four-point loading scenario to-collapse. The target data to be collected from these tests were the maximum load reached at failure, load-vertical deflection relationship, load-concrete strain relationship along the depth of the slab, the loadtensile reinforcement strain relationship for the bottom bars, and the failure mode of each specimen. These results were then be correlated to the theoretical moment and shear capacity using available equations in the literature. A summary of the test matrix is presented in Table 3.1. Each of the seven groups composing the test matrix investigates certain set of parameters as summarized in Table 3.2, The aim of the first three groups (G1, G2 and G3) was to study the behavior and capacity of the spliced bar configuration (i.e. contact vs non-contact configuration) at the joint with respect to the four proposed closer strip width and their corresponding lap splice length. While Groups G3, G4, and G5 were designed to study the effect of varying the main bar spacing on the capacity of the connection at the joint with respect to the four proposed closer strip
25

Chapter 3| Experimental Program

width and their corresponding lap splice length. Finally groups G4 and G6 are designed to study the effect of the compressive strength of the joint-filled material which is in this study is UHPFRC. 3.2 Description of tested specimens All slabs in this study except slab S1 and S2 had a shear key on the left and right side of the joint. The dimensions and shape of the shear key were identical for all the jointed slabs as presented in Figure 3.1. The description of each group is shown as follow. 3.2.1 Control Group (CG)

Three control slabs were considered in this group, namely: S1, S2, and S3. Each slab was 2800 mm long, 600 mm wide and of 200 mm depth. All the slabs have continuous (non-spliced) bars with main bar spacing of 200 mm. Slabs S1 and S2 were considered cast-in-place slabs using normal strength concrete and UHPFRC, respectively. Figure 3.2 shows details of slabs S1 and S2 made of normal strength concrete and UHPFRC, respectively. Figure 3.3 shows dimensioning, joint configuration and GFRP arrangement of precast slab S3. This jointed slab is intended to study the effect of using UHPFRC in the joint in a precast slab build with normal strength concrete compared to slab S1 which was built entirely from normal strength concrete. It should be noted that the GFRP bars in the slab were continuous through the joint to limit the difference between the two slabs in the strength of concrete at the joint location. 3.2.2 Group G1

This group considered contact lap splice where the spacing between the lap splice is zero (i.e. contact or overlapped splice). The size and bar arrangement in this slab were identical to those in slab S3 except that the joint had spliced bars. Slabs in this group were designated as S4, S5, S6, and
26

Chapter 3| Experimental Program

S7, with bar splice lengths into the joint of 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, respectively. This made the joint widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 m for slabs S4, S5, S6, and S7, respectively. This made the development length of the bars in the joint of 25 mm short from the joint width to allow for construction tolerance. Figure 3.4 depicts the dimensioning, joint details and GFRP bar arrangement in the slabs of group G1. 3.2.3 Group G2

Group G2 was identical to group G1 except that the spacing between the spliced bar in the joint was taken as 50 mm (i.e. non-contact lap splice). Slabs in this group were designated as S8, S9, S10, and S11, with bar splice lengths into the joint of 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, respectively. This made the joint widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 m for slabs S8, S9, S10, and S11, respectively. This made the development length of the bars in the joint of 25 mm short from the joint width to allow for construction tolerance. Figure 3.5 depicts the dimensioning, joint details and GFRP bar arrangement in the slabs of group G2. 3.2.4 Group G3

Group G3 was identical to group G1 except that the spacing between the spliced bar in the joint was taken as 100 mm (i.e. non-contact lap splice). Slabs in this group were designated as S12, S13, S14, and S15, with bar splice lengths into the joint of 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, respectively. This made the joint widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 m for slabs S8, S9, S10, and S11, respectively. This made the development length of the bars in the joint of 25 mm short from the joint width to allow for construction tolerance. Figure 3.6 depicts the dimensioning, joint details and GFRP bar arrangement in the slabs of group G3. 3.2.5 Group G4
27

Chapter 3| Experimental Program

Groups G4 and G5 were considered to study the effect of joint width with different spacing between main bars in the slab, with maintaining the spacing between spliced bars as half the spacing between main bars in the precast slab. This makes the GFRP ratio in the slab different from those in groups G1 through 3. Each slab in groups G4 and G5 was 2800 mm long, 475 mm wide and of 200 mm depth. All the slabs in Group G4 had main bar spacing of 150 mm and spacing between the spliced bar in the joint 75 mm. Slabs in this group were designated as S16, S17, S18, and S19, with bar splice lengths into the joint of 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, respectively. This made the joint widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 m for slabs S16, S17, S18, and S19, respectively. Figure 3.7 depicts the dimensioning, joint details and GFRP bar arrangement in the slabs of group G4. 3.2.6 Group G5

Groups G5 was identical to group G4 except that the spacing of main bars was taken as 100 mm and the spacing between the spliced bar in the joint 50 mm. Slabs in this group were designated as S20, S21, S22, and S23, with bar splice lengths into the joint of 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, respectively. This made the joint widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 m for slabs S20, S21, S22, and S23, respectively. Figure 3.8 depicts the dimensioning, joint details and GFRP bar arrangement in the slabs of group G5. 3.2.7 Group G6

Groups G6 was identical to group G4 except that the target compressive strength of UHPFRC was 120 MPa in the former and 160 MPa in the later to examine whether the reduction in UHPFRC strength to 120 MPa would make a difference in the structural behavior, crack pattern and ultimate load carrying capacity of the slab. Slabs in this group were designated as S24, S25, S26, and S27, with

28

Chapter 3| Experimental Program

bar splice lengths into the joint of 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, respectively. This made the joint widths of 125, 155, 185 and 215 m for slabs S24, S25, S26, and S27, respectively. 3.3 Specimen preparation 3.3.1 Form work To construct the specimens, timber forms were constructed using plywood sheets and 2×4 lumber cut to size, strengthened, oiled and sealed and made ready for the placement of the reinforcement ad depicted in Figures 3.17 through 3.34. 3.3.2 Joint forming Joints were formed using layers of Styrofoam cut to the exact joint shape, size, and dimensions using a hotwire and grooved to the exact dimensions to let GFRP bars go though as depicted Figures 3.22 through 3.35. The layers of Styrofoam forming the joint were glued together using waterproof special type glue to ensure the layers were bonded together to withstand the pressure resulting from concrete placement. 3.3.3 Reinforcement assembly The longitudinal GFRP bars considered in this study were ordered from the manufacturer as it was cut to the exact bar size required to form the main top and bottom reinforcement as well as the top and bottom transverse reinforcement. The bar meshes were assembled using plastic zip ties and placed in location in the formwork using concrete cover seats as depicted in Figures 3.15 through 3.21. Material properties of the GFRP bare are listed in Table 3.3 as obtained from the GFRP manufacturer. The tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the bars were 1188 MPa and 64 GPa, respectively. While the tensile strain at rupture was 2.6%. Two bar sizes were considered in
29

Chapter 3| Experimental Program

this study, namely: 12M and 16M bars with nominal cross-sectional area of 113 and 201 mm2, respectively. The main tension reinforcement and bottom transverse reinforcement the slabs were considered of M16 bar, while top mesh was considered of M12 bars. 3.3.4 Bar strain gauge Instrumentation GFRP bar strain gauges were used to record strain history during the test. Bar strain-gauges were attached to bottom reinforcing bars as depicted in Figure 3.9. The gauges were installed by marking the location of the gauge on the bar then grinding the surface of the bar using handheld rotating head grinder to remove the GFRP bar ribs at the gauge location and to ensure an even surface for the gauge to be attached and ensure the best bond was achieved. The surface of the bar was cleaned from dust and residues and cleaned with a conditioner and surface neutralizer, then the surface of the gauge and the bar were coated with the glue hardener and a layer of glue was applied to the bar and the gauge was applied to the bar and held in place for a few seconds to ensure the glue was hardened. Figures 3.24 through 3.35 show views of bar stain gauges in different slabs. 3.3.5 Casting The finished forms of the slabs were secured to a flat-leveled ground to ensure perfect level of concrete was achieved when casting. Each slab was cast on two stages. The first stage included casting the cast-in-place slabs and jointed precast slab with target normal strength concrete of 35 MPa, except that cast-in-place slab S2 was cast with target compressive strength of 160 MPa for UHPFRC. Table 3.4 shows typical composition of UHPFRC. However, each supplier provided the dry mix bags without details about the mix design. Vibrators were used to ensure better concrete compaction and to prevent honey combing and air pockets from forming. Then, the top surface of concrete was leveled flush, then left to cure for 28 days while being covered with plastic
30

Chapter 3| Experimental Program

sheets and sprayed with water. After the curing period was over, the joint foam was removed and the joint surface and the GFRP bars were cleaned from any residue and the joint was sprayed with water to prepare it for casting as directed by the UHPFRC supplier. UHPFRC of the joint was mixed in the structures laboratory and cast into the joint as shown Figures 3.39 through 3.52. Then, the joint was covered with a plywood sheet as instructed by the UHPFRC supplier. Concrete cylinder specimens were collected from every batch so that they can be tested on the day of testing of the slabs. Figure 3.53 showed view of the jointed slabs before preparation for the testing. Before the start of each test, the surface of the joint was prepared at specified locations to glue concrete strain gauges. Figures 3.10 and 3.11 depict the locations of concrete strain gauges at the top surface and on the side of the slab at the mid-span location. The slab was then painted in white for the precast panels and light yellow for the UHPFRC joint.

3.4 Test setup and test procedure A four-point loading setup was used in the testing in order to expose the joint to pure flexure. Figure 3.12 shows the test setup for slabs S1 and S2, while Figure 3.13 shows the test setup for slabs S3 through S19. The slab was supported over steel pedestals and on top of the left pedestals. A hinged support was utilized at the left support line using a steel rod sandwiched between two grooved steel plates while at the right support line, a roller support was formed on top of the pedestal using a steel rod sandwiched between two flat steel plates. In slabs S20 to S27, the fourpoint loading was adjusted as shown in Figure 3.14 so that the middle point loads were located just over the joint to increase the tendency for flexural failure mode. Two linear variable displacement transducers (LVDTs) were installed at the mid-span to measure the deflection as depicted in Figures 3.12 through 3.14. The load was applied gradually in increments of 10 kN till
31

failure so that initiation of cracks and crack propagations were recorded. A data acquisition system was used to collect data from sensors during the test. After each test, data collected from sensors were analyzed and presented in graphical format for further discussions.

Chapter IV Experimental Results
4.1 Experimental results

The proposed research investigates the use of GFRP bars in the closure strip between jointed precast deck panels, which is filled with ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). Four different bar splice lengths in the joint were considered in this study, namely: 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, with bar splice spacing taken as 0, 75 and 100 mm. 27 specimens were constructed and tested to-collapse to determine their structural behavior and load carrying capacity. Different spacing between spliced bars into the joint were considered, namely, 0, 50, 75 and 100 mm. Correlation between experimental findings and available design equations for moment and shear capacities was conducted, leading to recommendations for the use of the proposed joints between precast deck panels in slab-on-girder bridges. This chapter discusses the behavior of the tested cast-in-place and jointed slabs as obtained from experimental findings in the form of cracking patterns, ultimate capacity, deflection pattern, ultimate deflection and load-strain relationships. Concrete cylinder specimens were tested to-collapse at the time of each test to determine the average compressive strength of normal-strength concrete as well as UHPFRC. Table 4.1 summaries the results from these tests for each slab. 4.1.1 Cracking pattern, ultimate capacity, and failure modes The following section discusses the failure modes, cracking patterns and ultimate load carrying capacity of the tested slabs.

Chapter 4| Experimental results

4.1.1.1

Control Group

Figures 4.1 through 4.2 show views of cracks in the control cast-in-place slab S1. It was observed that the first flexural crack appeared at 23.25 kN at the mid-span location, followed by other flexural cracks appearing within the quarter points of the slab and propagating vertically upwards the top of the slab. As the load increased, some cracks started to deviate diagonally around the slab quarter points, leading to sudden flexural-shear failure between the point load the support at an ultimate load of 137.08 kN.m. Slab S2 which was made entirely from UHPFRC had the test setup before and after testing as depicted in Figures 4.3 and 4.4, respectively. The slab had the first flexural crack visually observed at the mid-span region at a load increment of 88.15 kN. In contrast to the flexural crack in slab S1, steel fibers appeared bridging the flexural crack. With increase in the applied load, other flexural cracks appeared between the two loading points as shown in Figures 4.5. Cracks continued widening and propagating to the top surface of the slab till a sudden compression failure occurred at the top of the slab at about 150 mm from the mid-span point. The slab failed in pure flexural mode at an ultimate load of 236.72 kN. Slab S3 which was identical to slab S1 with continuous GFRP bars between supports but with UHPFRC-filled joint at the mid-span was with UHPFRC joint. Figures 4.6 and 4.7 show views of the slab test setup before and after failure. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 21.05 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab till almost half the depth of the shear key, then it deviated diagonally away from the shear key and into the precast slab as depicted in Figure 4.9. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear at a load increment of 30 kN between the loading point and the mid-span. Other diagonal cracks appeared
34

Chapter 4| Experimental results

between the point load and the supports at higher loads till a sudden flexural-shear failure took place at an ultimate load of 149.68 kN as shown in Figures 4.11 and 4.12. Figures 4.129 4.130 show the cracking pattern from the two sides of slabs S1, S2 and S3 when stacked on top of each other. One may observe that the use of UHPFRC in slab S2 in lieu of normal strength concrete in slab S1 changed the failure mode from flexural-shear to pure flexural mode and increased the slab ultimate load carrying capacity by 73%. When comparing results for slabs S1 and S3, it can be observed that the increase of material strength within 185 width at the mid-span using UHPFRC increased the load carrying capacity of the slab by 9% while the failure more remained unchanged. 4.1.1.2 Group G1

Slabs in Group G1 had contact spliced bars with different splice length and associated joint width. The jointed slab S4 with splice length of 75 mm and joint width of 125 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.10 and 4.11. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 21.35 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.14. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab causing flexural failure at an ultimate load of 99.34 kN as shown in Figures 4.12 and 4.13. The jointed slab S5 with splice length of 105 mm and joint width of 155 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 23.65 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.17. Other flexural cracks within the precast
35

Chapter 4| Experimental results

slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab causing flexural failure at an ultimate load of 120.32 kN as shown in Figures 4.16 and 4.17. The jointed slab S6 with splice length of 135 mm and joint width of 185 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.18 and 4.19. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 22.80 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.21. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab with increase of applied load. Also, other diagonal cracks appeared just beside the point load on the support side and propagated further in the slab thickness till reaching a sudden flexural-shear failure at an ultimate load of 135.74 kN as shown in Figures 4.20 and 4.21. The jointed slab S7 with splice length of 165 mm and joint width of 215 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.22 and 4.23. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 23.55 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.25. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab with increase of applied load. Also, other diagonal cracks appeared just beside the point load on the support side and propagated further in the slab thickness till reaching a sudden flexural-shear failure at an ultimate load of 131.82 kN as shown in Figures 4.24 and 4.25.

Chapter 4| Experimental results

Figures 4.107 and 4.108 show the cracking pattern from the two sides of slabs S4, S5 , S6 and S7 when stacked on top of each other. One may observe that with increase in bar splice length and hence the joint width, the failure mode changed from pure flexural to combined flexural and shear. When comparing results for slabs S4 and S5 of the same failure mode, it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 75 to 105 mm increased the slab capacity by 21%. Also, when comparing results for slabs S5 and S6, it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 105 to 135 mm increased the slab capacity by 13% and changed the failure mode from flexural to combined-flexure and shear. Moreover, when comparing results for slabs S6 and S7, it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 135 to 165 mm showed slight change in the load carrying capacity of 3% while the failure mode remained unchanged. The slight difference of 3% may be attributed to the slight difference in compressive strength of the concrete materials as depicted in Table 4.1. So, it can be concluded that the load carrying capacity of the slab may remain unchanged increase in splice length beyond 135 mm and hence the joint width beyond 185 mm. In slabs S4 and S5, one may observe that the flexural crack at the interface between the UHPFRC and the precast slab was too wide to the extent that bar slip from the UHPFRC occurred. To investigate this possibility, a core sample was taken from each slab and then sliced at the bar location to examine whether the bar slipped from concrete. Figure 4.119 and 4.120 show views of the sliced core sample showing the end of the GFRP bar slipped from concrete at its end as well as shearing of bar ribs, respectively. 4.1.1.3 Group G2

Slabs in Group G2 had non-contact spliced bars with spacing between spliced bars of 50 mm but with different splice lengths and associated joint widths. The jointed slab S8 with splice length of 75 mm and joint width of 125 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as

Chapter 4| Experimental results

depicted in Figures 4.26 and 4.27. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 22.05 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.29. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab. However, the flexural crack at the joint-precast slab interface continued to widen till slip occurred in the bar from UHPFRC causing no increase in the applied load that reached 88.74. Figures 4.28 and 4.29 show view of the flexural failure mode of this jointed slab. The jointed slab S9 with splice length of 105 mm and joint width of 155 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.30 and 4.31. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 20.40 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.33. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab causing flexural failure at an ultimate load of 110.24 kN as shown in Figures 4.32 and 4.33. Similar observation regarding bar slip from UHPFRC at failure was noted through the very wide flexural crack at through the wide flexural crack at the joint-precast slab interface.

Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab causing flexural failure at an ultimate load of 128.41 kN as shown in Figures 4.41 and 4.42. Similar observation regarding bar slip from UHPFRC at failure was noted through the very wide flexural crack at through the wide flexural crack at the joint-precast slab interface. Figures 4.109 and 4.110 show the cracking pattern from the two sides of slabs S8, S9 , S10 and S11 when stacked on top of each other. One may observe that with increase in bar splice length and hence the joint width, the failure mode remained unchanged. When comparing results for slabs S8, S9 , S10 and S11 of the same failure mode, it can be observed that the slab capacity increased by 24%, 24% and 45% with increase of splice length from 75 to 105, 135 and 165 mm, respectively. 4.1.1.4 Group G3

UHPFRC-filled joint at 18.30 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.44. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab causing flexural failure at an ultimate load of 97.71 kN as shown in Figures 4.44 and 4.45. Indication of bar slip from UHPFRC at failure was noted through the very wide flexural crack at through the wide flexural crack at the joint-precast slab interface. The jointed slab S13 with splice length of 105 mm and joint width of 155 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.46 and 4.47. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 18.68 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.48. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab causing flexural failure at an ultimate load of 117.51 kN as shown in Figure 4.49. Similar observation to slab S12 was noted regarding bar slip from UHPFRC at failure through the very wide flexural crack at through the wide flexural crack at the joint-precast slab interface The jointed slab S14 with splice length of 135 mm and joint width of 185 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.50 and 4.51.

UHPFRC resulting in wide flexural cracking at the joint-precast slab interface at an ultimate load of 133.74 kN as shown in Figures 4.52 and 4.53. The jointed slab S15 with splice length of 165 mm and joint width of 215 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.54 and 4.55. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 18.90 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.56. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab with increase of applied load. Also, other diagonal cracks appeared just beside the point load on the support side and propagated further in the slab thickness till reaching a sudden flexural-shear failure at an ultimate load of 136.86 kN as shown in Figures 4.56 and 4.75. Figures 4.111 and 4.112 show the cracking pattern from the two sides of slabs S12, S13 , S14 and S15 when stacked on top of each other. One may observe that with increase in bar splice length and hence the joint width, the failure mode changed from pure flexural to combined flexural and shear. When comparing results for slabs S12, S13 and S14 of the same failure mode, it can be observed that the slab capacity increased by 20% and 37% with increase in splice length from 75 to 105 and 135 mm, respectively. Also, when comparing results for slabs S14 and S15, it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 135 to 165 mm increased the slab capacity by only 2.3% while the failure mode changed from flexural to combined-flexure and shear. The slight difference of 3% may be attributed to the slight difference in compressive strength of the concrete materials as depicted in Table 4.1. So, it can be concluded that the load carrying capacity of the slab may remain unchanged increase in splice length beyond 135 mm and hence the joint width beyond 185 mm.

Figures 4.113 and 4.114 show the cracking pattern from the two sides of slabs S16, S17, S18 and S19 when stacked on top of each other.

splice length changes from 105 to 135 and 165 mm, respectively, with failure more remained unchanged. 4.1.1.6 Group G5

kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.84. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab with increase of applied load. Also, other diagonal cracks appeared just beside the point load on the support side and propagated further in the slab thickness till reaching a sudden flexural-shear failure at an ultimate load of 79.25 kN as shown in Figures 4.84 and 4.85. The jointed slab S23 with splice length of 165 mm and joint width of 215 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.86 and 4.87.

Also, other diagonal cracks appeared just beside the point load on the support side and propagated further in the slab thickness till reaching a sudden flexural-shear failure at an ultimate load of 79.25 kN as shown in Figures 4.88 and 4.89. Figures 4.117 and 4.115 show the cracking pattern from the two sides of slabs S20, S21, S22 and S23 when stacked on top of each other. One may observe that with increase in bar splice length and hence the joint width, the failure mode changed from pure flexural to combined flexural and shear. When comparing results for slabs S20 and S21 of the same failure mode, it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 75 to 105 mm increased the slab capacity by 28%. Also, when comparing results for slabs S21 and S22, it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 105 to 135 mm increased the slab capacity by only 2.4% while the failure mode changed from flexural to combined-flexure and shear. Moreover, when comparing results for slabs S22 and S23,
45

Chapter 4| Experimental results

it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 135 to 165 mm showed slight change in the load carrying capacity of 3% while the failure mode remained unchanged. The slight difference of 3% may be attributed to the slight difference in compressive strength of the concrete materials as depicted in Table 4.1. So, it can be concluded that the load carrying capacity of the slab may remain unchanged increase in splice length beyond 135 mm and hence the joint width beyond 185 mm. 4.1.1.7 Group G6

Slabs in Group G6 were identical to those in group G4 but the later has UHPFRC target compressive strength of 120 MPa. The jointed slab S24 with splice length of 75 mm and joint width of 125 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.90 and 4.91. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 6.75 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.92.

Chapter 4| Experimental results

The jointed slab S26 with splice length of 135 mm and joint width of 185 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4. 97 and 4.98. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 5.49 kN. This crack continued propagating upward along the interface of the joint and the precast slab with increase in applied load as depicted in Figure 4.99. Other flexural cracks within the precast slab started to appear between the quarter points of the slab and continued propagating towards the top of the slab with increase of applied load. Also, other diagonal cracks appeared just beside the point load on the support side and propagated further in the slab thickness till reaching a sudden flexural-shear failure at an ultimate load of 105.35 kN as shown in Figures 4.99 and 4.100. One may observe that wide flexural crack occurred at the joint-precast slab interface indicating bar slip from concrete at failure. So, two types of failure appeared in this specimen at failure, namely: flexural failure at the joint-precast slab interface due to bar slippage and flexural-shear failure just beside the point load towards the support. The jointed slab S27 with splice length of 165 mm and joint width of 215 mm was tested to-collapse with setup before and after failure as depicted in Figures 4.101 and 4.102. The first flexural crack was observed at the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPFRC-filled joint at 4.30 kN.

Also, other diagonal cracks appeared just beside the point load on the support side and propagated further in the slab thickness till reaching an ultimate load of 100.3125 kN. This slab showed signs of wide flexural crack at the joint-precast slab interface indicating bar slippage from UHPFRC as shown in Figures 4.103 and 4.104.

Chapter 4| Experimental results

Figures 4.117 and 4.118 show the cracking pattern from the two sides of slabs S24, S25, S26 and S27 when stacked on top of each other. One may observe that with increase in bar splice length and hence the joint width, the failure mode remained generally unchanged as flexural mode with an exception of slab S26 that showed flexural crack at joint-precast slab interface combined with flexural-shear crack almost at the quarter point. When comparing results for slabs S24, S25 and S26, it can be observed that the slab capacity increased by 22% and 44% when increasing the splice length from 75 to 105 and 135 mm, respectively. Also, when comparing results for slabs S26 and S27, it can be observed that the increase of splice length from 135 to 165 mm changed the slab capacity by only 5%. 4.1.2 Deflection patterns and ultimate strain Figures 4.121 through 4.127 present the load-deflection relationships for each test group, this relationship could be used to indicate the change in slab flexural stiffness due to cracking. Figure 4.121 shows incremental load-deflection relationship of slabs S1, S2 and S3 in the control group. It can be observed that slab S1 with normal strength concrete and S3, both with continuous bars had identical load-deflection relationships irrespective of the presence of the 185 mm wide UHPFRC joint. The load-deflection relationship for both slabs followed an elastic pattern up to the cracking load. The cracking load of S1 was slightly but non-significantly higher than that of S3 due to the presence of a cold joint at the interface of the shear key. The failure of slabs S1 and S3 exhibited similar deflection change in response to increasing the load, reaching an ultimate deflection of 51.57 and 68.94 mm, respectively. Slab S2 being entirely from UHPFRC exhibited a more ductile behavior with linearly elastic load-deflection relationship up to 88.15 kN. Then, flexural stiffness started to decrease as cracks started to develop and the load-deflection relationship stated to experience a non-linear behavior up to about 216.6 kN then the load dropped
48

Chapter 4| Experimental results

as the curve proceeded in a negative slope to reach 206 kN reaching a point of zero slope. Then, the slab picked up the load and hence the load-deflection relationship continued in a positive slope in a linear manner till failure at 236.72 kN. Slabs in groups G1 to G6 followed the same behavior of the control Slabs S1 and S3. A comparison of the deflection values of slabs in groups G1, G2, and G3 to the deflection of S1 and S3 is presented in Table 4.9. Figure 4.128 through 4.181 presents the load-concrete strain relationship load-bar strain relationship for slabs S1 through S27. Summary of the ultimate concrete strain gauges, and bars strain gauges are presented in Tables 4.2 through Table 4.7. Comparisons have been conducted between the control slabs and slabs in group G1, G2, and G3, in terms of ultimate load, ultimate deflection, ultimate bottom reinforcement strain, and the ultimate concrete top compression fibers strain respectively. Table 4.3 presents a comparison of the bar stress at failure resulting from multiplying ultimate bar strain by bar modulus of elasticity. Then, the bar stress was compared to the bar tensile strength as obtained from the manufacturer. This gives an indication of the level of bar stress at failure. One may notice that bar tensile stresses at slab failure were generally less than the guaranteed tensile strength of the bar except for a few specimens with greatest joint width. On the other hand, when comparing experimental ultimate strain values with the ultimate tensile strain of the bar of 2.6% as provided by the manufacturers, one may observe that all bars remained in the elastic range at slab failure. 4.2 Effect of lap splice spacing and joint width Figure 4.206 shows the change in the experimental ultimate load with the change in the lap splice spacing. One may observe that the change of lap splice spacing as 0, 50 and 100 mm

49

Chapter 4| Experimental results

appears to have insignificant change in general if the change was considered for contact splice bars and the 100 mm spaced slice bars. The data in the graph for 50 mm lap splice spacing is considered relatively scattered with other data for the joint width of 185 mm. Figure 4.207 depicts the change in the resisting moment per meter width of the tested slab with the change in bar spacing from 100 to 200 mm with increment of 50 mm. It can be observed that the moment capacity per meter width decreases with increase bar spacing, as expected. Figures 4.208 and 4.209 present the change of the experimental failure moment per meter width with the increase in bar splice length and bar development length into the joint, respectively. It can be observed that the slab resisting moment generally increases with increase in bar lap splice length as well as the development length. 4.3 Theoretical moment and shear capacities Theoretical moment and shear capacities for the precast slabs were calculated based on ISIS Canada manual No. 3 (ISIS, 2007) and CHBDC of 2014. Sample calculations of the moment and shear capacity of a typical slab is shown in Appendix A. The capacities were calculated using spreadsheets programed based on the equations and procedures presented in the above-mentioned references. These capacities were obtained considering resistance factors for concrete and GFRP bars of 0.75 and 0.55, respectively. However, the experimental capacity requires a matching resistance factor for the sake of comparison. Chapter 2 of CHBDC (2014) specifies that the designer shall consider the environmental conditions and deterioration mechanisms for the FRP reinforcement. Clause 16.4 in Chapter 16 of CHBDC refer to durability of GFRP without considering a value for the durability factor to be taken in design. On the other hand, Clause 16.5.3 specifies resistance factors to be considered in design calculations. Such resistance factors are generally associated with uncertainty in material's
50

Chapter 4| Experimental results

mechanical properties obtained from standard mechanical test method (i.e. tensile strength test method for example). On the other hand, since the publication of the previous edition of the CHBDC, it is now recognized that the variability of the strength of FRPs is affected more by environmental exposure than by geometric properties and stress levels. It is for this reason that experts in the structural use of FRP are now suggesting that the resistance factors for FRPs should be specified as products of a "material" factor and an "environmental" factor (ACI 440, 2002; Karbhari, 2000). However, Clause 16.4 in CHBDC commentaries states that findings from analyses of available data in the literature have confirmed that the concerns about the durability of GFRP in alkaline concrete, based on simulated laboratory studies in alkaline solutions, are unfounded. Thus, the resistance factor for design calculations of GFRP in CHBDC was 0.75, as given in CHBDC Commentaries, which was mainly drawn from the Japanese document (JSCE, 1997). It is common practice that structural members shall be designed by one of the following methods: (a) standard design procedures and practices provided by the design code and any standards and specifications referred to in this code, or (b) one of the following three bases of design, (i) analysis based on generally established theory, (ii) evaluation of a given full-scale structure or a prototype by a loading tester, (iii) or studies of model analogues, provided the design ensures a level of safety and performance at least equivalent to that provided for or implicit in the design carried out by the methods referred to in Clause (a) above.

Chapter 4| Experimental results

Since the scope of this research is to provide experimental findings to qualify the proposed GFRPreinforced closure strip connecting precast deck slab panels, the experimental factor of safety is considered at least equivalent to 1 to ensure that the experimental capacity is at least equal the factored applied moment in the deck slab specified in CHBDC. In case of using experimental findings to qualify the proposed joint details, the resistance factor for design calculation in nonexistence. However, the author believes that a generic durability factor of 0.75 should apply to the experimental data. Table 4.12 present the factors of safety in design of the proposed joint details in the tested slabs as the ratio between the experimental moment resistance and the theoretical resistance moment as well as the ratio between the experimental shear resistance and the theoretical shear resistance GFRP when a durability factor of 0.75 is introduced to the experimental findings and the code resistance factors are applied to code theoretical equations for resisting moment and shear forces. One may observe that the factors of safety in pure shear capacity in the right column in the table is always more than 1. However, the factors of safety for moment is less than 1 for the jointed slabs. This may be attributed to the fact that the moment capacity was calculated for the GFRP-reinforced concrete section just outside the joint considering full bond between the GFRP bars and concrete. This criteria of full bond between the bar and concrete may not be applicable herein since the jointed slabs with pure flexural failure exhibited very wide flexural crack at the joint-precast slab interface, indicating bar slip from UHPFRC at slab failure. Also, the factor of safety for only pure moment capacity may not apply to slabs failed in combined flexure and shear. Thus, for design purposes, the experimental findings can directly be compared to the applied factored moment in the deck slab due to dead and live loads to obtain the maximum span between girders so that Design Engineers can implement one of the developed joint details in their projects. The follows section presents the procedure to achieve this task.

4.4 Design charts for moment capacity Table 4.8 provides a summary of correlation between the jointed slab capacities with respect to that for cast-in-place slab S1 as well as slab S3 with UHPFRC-filled joint but with continuous reinforcement through the joint. It can be observed that the capacities of the jointed slab are smaller than those for slabs S1 and S3. Also, it can be observed that the slab capacity increases with increase in joint width. As such, it was decided to be calculated the maximum served span between longitudinal girders in slab-on-girder bridges by comparing the applied factored moment in deck slab due to dead and live load with the experimental values. The applied transverse moments were calculated based according to Section 5 of CHBDC and using equations 2.23 and 2.24 mentioned in Chapter 2 for live load moment for simple slab and continuous slabs, respectively. Thus, the factored applied moment, Mf, is then given by, Mf = MfD + MfL And MfD = Mslab + Masphalt 4.2 4.1

Where Mslab = factored moment due to self-weight of the slab, Masphalt = factored moment due to weight of asphalt. Spreadsheet output for transverse moment calculations are presented in appendix A. The slab thickness considered in this study was 200 mm with unit weight of concrete of 24 kN/m3 and dead load factor of 1.2. The asphalt layer was assumed of 90 mm thickness and unit weight of 23.5 kN/m3 with dead load factor of 1.5. The wheel load for live load moment calculations was 87.5 kN with dynamic load allowance of 0.4 and live load factor of 1.7. The applied factored moment in deck slab was calculated for slab spans ranging from 1 to 4.5 m with 0.5 increments. Two deck slab conditions were considered in this study, namely: simple span deck span supported over two

girders and deck slab continuous over 3 of more supports. A reduction factor of 0.8 was applied to the live load moment for continuous span deck slab per CHBDC. On the other hand a durability/resistance factor of 0.75 was applied to the experimental resisting moment that was normalized to be per meter width rather than the actual slab width considered in the tested slab. Figures 4.210 through 4.215 show comparison between the applied factored moments for simple span and continuous span deck slabs against the modified experimental findings for girder spacing ranging from 1 to 4.5 m. From these figures, limiting girder spacing was determined for each joint configuration as the point of intersection of the factored applied moment and the resisting moment obtained experimentally. This data was then summarized in Table 4.13 to assist engineers in selecting the proper joint type per the girder spacing in their bridge project. The use of this data is limited to the materials and geometric conditions in this research. Also, some potential factors of interest could not be addressed in this study. So, bridge designers are expected to include these factors in their design.

Chapter V Conclusion and Recommendations for Future Research
5.1 General Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are used in bridge decks to overcome the problem of corrosion of steel bars and concrete spalling. However, design guidelines for joints between GFRPreinforced precast deck panels supported over girders for accelerated bridge replacement is as yet unavailable. The proposed research investigates the use of GFRP bars in the closure strip between jointed precast deck panels, which is filled with ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). Four different bar splice lengths in the joint were considered in this study, namely: 75, 105, 135 and 165 mm, with bar splice spacing taken as 0, 75 and 100 mm. 27 specimens were constructed and tested to-collapse to determine their structural behavior and load carrying capacity. Correlation between experimental findings and available design equations for moment and shear capacities was conducted, leading to recommendations for the use of the proposed joints between precast deck panels in slab-on-girder bridges. 5.2 Conclusions Based on experimental findings and theoretical analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The ultimate load capacity of UHPFRC slab reinforced with GFRP bars is higher than the capacity of an identical slab but made from normal strength concrete, as expected. The capacity of precast jointed slab with UHPFRC as filling material in the closure strip and continuous reinforced is slightly higher (about 9%) than that for cast-in-place slab with identical material and geometric properties.

Chapter 5| Conclusion and Recommendations for Future Research

2. The capacities of slabs with UHPFRC joints having spliced bars were less than the capacity of cast-in-place slab with made of normal strength concrete and similar GFRP properties. 3. The capacity of the jointed slabs increase as a result of increasing the bar splice length in the joint. Similar conclusion can apply to the bar development length into the joint as well as the joint width. 4. Slabs with joint width of 185 mm and 215 mm with contact spliced bars and slab with joint width of 215 mm with non-contact 100-mm-offset spliced bar spacing experienced flexural-shear failure mode away from the joint. Other slabs experienced flexural failure at the joint-precast slab interface, primarily due to bar slip from UHPFRC. 5. The slab with non-contact configuration of 50 mm offset yields the lowest capacity for any of the four given joint width, compared to the contact splice and the non-contact equally-spaced splice of 100 mm spacing which falls almost within the same range of the ultimate capacity for any of the four given joint widths. 6. Design tables and charts specifying the girder spacing limits for each joint configuration were developed based on the moment capacity of each tested jointed slab and the applied factored moment in bridge deck due to dead and live loads. This would assist engineers in selecting the proper joint type per the girder spacing in their bridge project. The use of this data is limited to the materials and geometric conditions in this research. Also, some potential factors of interest could not be addressed in this study. So, bridge designers are expected to include these factors in their design.

5.3 Recommendation for future research Based on the outcome of this research, the following recommendations for future research can be made: 1. Study of long term effects (creep, shrinkage, freeze/thaw cycles, fatigue loading) that may compromise the developed joints. 2. Investigation of the capacity of joints slabs at the negative moment region when they are subjected to local moment from wheel load and tensile force from the global bending moment on the composite girder. 3. Study the load carrying capacity of deck slabs made of fiber-reinforced concrete. 4. Study the load carrying capacity of the ribs of the ribbed-surface GFRP bars and its effect on the development length.
