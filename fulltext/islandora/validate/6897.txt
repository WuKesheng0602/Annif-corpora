The Enhanced Mentoring Program for Skilled Korean Immigrants: An Effective Tool for Successful Integration into The Canadian Labour Market? (A Grant Proposal)

Yang-Gyu Lee Master of Arts 2017 Immigration and Settlement Studies Ryerson University

ABSTRACT

Koreans have immigrated to Canada in the last twenty years seeking a better quality of life. The vast majority of recent Korean immigrants have been accepted under the economic class category, which indicates that they have either human capital or financial capital. However, most Korean immigrants experience downward mobility and reside in an ethnic bubble. Furthermore, mainly low confidence in English communication and cultural differences have impeded the participation in multicultural settlement services. Even some of the existing employment programs offered by settlement service providers are not approachable due to the limitation of eligibility. This practical MRP attempts to find a pragmatic solution to address the skill under-utilization issues experienced by skilled Korean immigrants. A specialized mentoring program is examined as a support for skilled Korean immigrants. The program aims to give them access to the Canadian labour market by integrating multiple facets of settlement and employment services.

Chapter 1. Introduction 1.1. Research purpose The purpose of this applied MRP is to develop an actual grant proposal that engages with issues related to immigration and/or settlement in a policy, service-delivery or advocacy context. This practical MRP attempts to find a pragmatic solution to address the skill under-utilization issues experienced by skilled Korean immigrants. A specialized mentoring program is examined as a support for skilled Korean immigrants. The program aims to give them access to the Canadian labour market by integrating multiple facets of employment services. The MRP also includes an analysis of the Korean Canadian Women's Association Family and Social Services (KCWA hereafter), a Korean ethnic non-profit settlement service agency. This agency is the only settlement agency that solely specializes in services for the Korean ethnic community. This research project is guided by the following research questions: 1. What are the issues hampering skilled Korean workers from integrating into the Canadian labour market? 2. How can a mentoring program contribute to achieving access to the Canadian labour market? 3. To what extent can a mentoring program evolve through the integration of additional components? 1.2. Background and research problem

Canadian immigration policy and labour market issues Canada is known as the country of immigrants. Historically, since the late 1960s, after the removal of restrictions relating to the source country of migrants and the introduction of the points system, the number of immigrants from non-European countries has increased
1

dramatically (Reitz, 2003). Also, in the context of the globalization, the Canadian economy has transformed from a traditional industrial economy to a post-industrial knowledge-based economy starting in the 1980s and 1990s. The knowledge-based economy has resulted in an increasing number of both service and information technology industries. One outcome of this knowledgebased transition was the demand for high-skilled labour by increasing economies (Beckhusen, Florax, Poot, & Waldorf, 2013). Changes in the Canadian immigration policy followed as the points system was established, specifically targeting immigrants with a high-level of human capital (Liu, 2007). Hence, assessing potential immigrants on the basis of their education, work experience, and language proficiency, using a points-based system became an established way to enter Canada (Grubel, 2013). From 1991 to 2001, the labour force due to immigration grew to 70 percent for Canada, 97 percent for Ontario and 132 percent for Toronto (Weiner, 2008). In particular, the number of skilled immigrants from the Global South, who have high levels of education and work experience, showed a steep increase. This trend has led theorists to argue that Canada's immigration policy has been mainly influenced by human capital theory (Li, 2003). The human capital model suggests that the individuals with a similar level of education will gain a comparable amount of financial returns (Becker, 1975). However, despite rising education levels, the economic performance of recent immigrants continues to decline (Frenette & Morrisette, 2003; Galarneau & Morrisette, 2004). Many scholars have been raising issues regarding immigrants' low level of attainment of gainful employment, as indicated by lower employment rates, lower earnings, and employment in professions outside of the immigrants' areas of training (Reitz, 2001; Alboim et al.,2005; Teelucksingh and Galabuzi, 2005). This phenomenon is attributed to both the underutilization of
2

immigrants' skills and immigrants' experiences of racism based on their origins (Reitz et al., 2013). There are several possible factors that may explain the devaluing of immigrants' foreignobtained human capital. These factors include language difficulties (Conference Board of Canada, 2004; Chiswick & Miller, 2003; Aydemir & Skuterud, 2004); a lack of both Canadian experience and knowledge of Canadian workplace norms and practices (Conference Board of Canada, 2004; Alboim et al., 2005); a lack of access to informal social and employment networks (Kunz, 2003); discrimination based on race, ethnicity and religion (PROMPT, 2005; Ornstein, 2006; Teelucksingh & Galabuzi, 2005; Kunz; 2003); and changes in the composition of the labour force (Reitz, 200l). Korean immigrants in Canada Canada's open immigration policy and the introduction of the points system based on personal assets such as education, work experience, and English skills resulted in a steep increase in the number of visible minority immigrants, especially from Asian countries (Kelley & Trebilcock, 2010) including Korea (Kwak, 2004; Hong, 2008). Particularly, in the late 1990s, Korea suffered from an unexpected economic crisis, which contributed to an unprecedented increase of Koreans' emigrating to Canada (Hong, 2008; Kwak, 2004; Song, 2010). According to Lindsay (2007), the Korean community is the seventh largest non-European ethnic group in Canada. Koreans have immigrated to Canada in the last twenty years seeking a better quality of life, including a better future for their children. A vast majority of recent Korean immigrants have been accepted under the economic class category, which indicates that they have either human capital or financial capital. Korean immigrants are known to possess the highest
3

education level among the top ten source countries (Hong, 2008; Kwak, 2008). However, according to Statistics Canada's 2006 census data, the Korean ethnic group shows the lowest labour market participation, highest unemployment rate and lowest income among all ethnic groups in Canada (Block & Galabuzi, 2011). Furthermore, Koreans tend to reside in their own ethnic enclaves rather than integrate into the mainstream society. Also, a large number of skilled immigrants end up being self-employed running small-sized family businesses.(Kwak, 2008; Park, 2016; Song, 2010) A study claims that the reasons that skilled Korean immigrants have difficulty finding a job matching their qualifications are due to: a lack of international credential recognition; a lack of confidence in the English language; a lack of social networking; and settlement services not meeting needs (Park, 2016). Mentoring programs in settlement sector Governments and non-profit organizations have initiated and supported a number of employment service programs in an effort to lower the barriers (Alboim & McIsaac, 2007; Reitz et al., 2013). These interventions, include enhanced language/communication training, mentoring, bridge training programs, work experience programs and loan programs (Alboim & McIsaac, 2007). Mentoring programs offered in settlement service organizations are designed to tackle the Canadian experience issue. Many settlement service organizations claim that they provide mentoring services to build immigrants' networks, or social capital, which I will discuss in more detail later in this paper, and to provide an opportunity to improve knowledge about the Canadian work environment. According to my observations, there are not many settlement organizations actively employing the internet as a tool for service provision, even though internet-based services are a dominant trend in many other service industries. In addition, it is hard to find studies that address
4

the use of internet services in the settlement sector. It is particularly noteworthy that online mentoring programs have been employed in diverse service sectors for efficient service delivery. It is noticed that recently, only a handful pre-arrival service providers have started using internet tools for their services. This MRP argues that the Enhanced Mentoring Program (EMP), which is the combination of incorporating web-based platforms, collaboration with other service providers, and conventional mentoring services is an effective way to improve the opportunity for the labour market integration of skilled Korean immigrants. Based on this argument in support of the EMP, I propose an actual grant for a settlement service organization that works with the Korean community. 1.3. Significance of the study This study focuses on the mentoring service and the expansion of the service to improve the impact of the service towards a target population. The expansion of service includes using web-based platforms so that it can accommodate online networking, integrating other employment services through the collaboration with other service providers; sharing of resources and information, workshops, and consultation. There have not been enough studies available discussing how mentoring services are provided in the settlement sector. This MRP study focuses on the delivery of effective mentoring services by introducing services offered by other industries. In addition, this study is unique because it initiates the discussion of ethno-specific mentoring service idea. Ultimately, a Korean-oriented mentoring service will benefit the Korean community that has limited access to existing employment service programs due to eligibility issues. Furthermore, this MRP study adopts a pragmatic approach that can be directly employed by settlement service agencies for the development of a new project idea and funding sourcing.

Chapter 2. Literature Review 2.1. Background of current labour market issues As discussed earlier, Canada's current immigration policy is largely based on the human capital theory, which claims that workers' earnings reflect the productive value of their skills, especially formal education and work experience (Reitz, 2005). Canadian immigration policy has a close link to the transformation of the structure of Canadian economy since the mid-1970s, which is moving out from a manufacturing based economy to a post-industrial knowledge-based economy. This shift towards a knowledge-based economy resulted in the change of focus in the Canadian labour market (Davidson, 2007). Consequently, Canadian immigration policy has gone through a change in it's emphasis on education over all other criteria in the selection process (Reitz, 2001). This emphasis on education and other qualities of human capital that are applied in the points system in the immigration policy is rooted in the assumption that immigrants who satisfy the criteria will successfully integrate into Canadian labour market. As a result, the education levels of recent immigrants to Canada have steadily increased (Davidson, 2007). However, Reitz (2005) argues that immigrants' labour market outcomes for the last three decades show contradictory results in contrast to human capital theory. According to Statistics Canada (2003), among immigrants who arrived in 2000, university graduates comprise 45 percent, yet their earnings after a year in Canada were less than those who arrived in the 1980s. Also, the official language skills of immigrants who arrived in 2000 were almost the same as those who arrived ten years ago (Reitz, 2005). Schmidtke (2007) argues that the immigrants who arrived in Canada in the mid-1990s earned 20 percent less than Canadian-born individuals, as opposed to those who immigrated in the 1980s who received 23 percent more than their Canadian-born cohorts. This result demonstrates that the income level of immigrants has

6

dropped 43 percent over the past twenty years. Considering this ironical situation, it is evident that there are certain factors that are restricting immigrants from fully utilizing their human capital that they have obtained overseas. The recent arrival of highly educated professionals and tradespeople shows evident contrast that recent immigrants are worse off than earlier immigrant cohorts. Teelucksingh and Galabuzi (2005) demonstrate the declining labour force participation rates for recent immigrants in the twenty-year span from 75.7 percent in 1981, to 68.6 percent in 1991, and to the latest 65.8 percent in 2001. Walsh (2004) recorded that 47 percent of employed immigrants worked in jobs unrelated to their fields; 60 percent of foreign-educated professionals took jobs not related to their training when they first came to Canada, and many held the same job three years later; and less than 25 percent of those who were actually employed were working in the field for which they had been educated. A similar study by Statistics Canada compared occupations of immigrants before and after arrival in Canada and found that 60 percent of new immigrants did not find employment in the same occupational fields they had prior to arriving in Canada. Fiftytwo percent of these people were looking for another job. After six months in Canada, 24.9 percent of employed immigrant men and 37.3 percent of employed immigrant women were working in sales and service occupations. Before arriving in Canada, only 10.2 percent of these men and 12.1 percent of these women were employed in such occupations. Likewise, only about half of the immigrants who were previously employed in natural and applied science occupations had these occupations after arrival in Canada (CLBC, 2004). As recent immigrants have not been able to translate their educational attainment and work experience into commensurate occupational status or income, such a situation is often referred to as "brain waste" (Reitz, 2001, p. 349). As a result, poverty rates for recent immigrants have risen substantially from 24.6

7

percent in 1981 to 35.8 percent in 2001 (Statistics Canada 2003). The decline of immigrants' home ownership advantage, as well as, the rising self-employment rates in recent immigrant populations further illustrate this precarious situation (RBC Financial Group, 2005). Lochhead (2003) argues that the increasing poverty rates are evident for newcomers in all age groups, at all education levels, of all language backgrounds, and in all family types. This increasing poverty number tells us that the transition into the Canadian society is becoming more difficult for new arrivals. A number of studies also testify that newcomers face numerous barriers in their initial settlement process, of which the most significant is gaining access to employment. This transition penalty clearly points to the initial lack of access to employment as the culprit, which consequently has a long-lasting impact on immigrants' labour market performance. According to newcomers, employment is the single most important aspect of settlement and their greatest need. This need usually surfaces within one year upon their arrival. Therefore, how fast and well newcomers can find gainful employment in their initial settlement stage dictates their labour market integration in the long run (Grenier, 2010). In fact, labour market integration is a multi-dimensional issue involving multiple players including all levels of government, educational institutions, employers, unions, regulatory bodies, academic credential assessment services and immigrant settlement agencies, as well as skilled immigrants themselves and their associations. Li (2003) also argues that human capital theory, which the current Canadian immigration policy is relying on, has failed to take into account the structural barriers and inequalities that have discounted the value of the immigrants' human capital. It is largely because the human capital theory focuses on individual attributes as determinants of economic performance, while ignoring factors such as systemic discrimination and individual barriers affecting the economic performance of immigrants (Li, 2003). A large volume of literature has

8

addressed the barriers facing both newcomers and the host society (Alboim et al., 2005; Dlamini et al., 2012; Gilmore & Le Petit, 2008; Li, 2003; Luk, 2011; Reitz, 2005; Sakamoto, 2007). For instance, according to a longitudinal survey of immigrants to Canada, 70 percent of new immigrants trying to enter the labour force identified at least one problem with the process (Chui & Tran, 2005). The top three barriers immigrants cited were a lack of Canadian work experience, a lack of transferability of foreign qualifications and language barriers (Baklid et al., 2005). In addition, all the signs of unemployment and underemployment seem to suggest some systematic problems that exist in the host society. Occupational barriers, including both formal and informal occupational barriers, are defined as entry requirements that seek to control access to employment in different occupations (Ahamad et al., 2003). Licensing regulations that govern entry to occupations constitute the main formal barrier to employment. Access to employment can also be affected by other aforementioned factors such as failing to recognize foreign credentials and work experience. These are often referred to as informal occupational barriers. 2.2. Informal obstacles to employment Lack of knowledge and information According to the research executed by Allies (2015), many newcomers do not have the information they need to successfully integrate into the Canadian labour market prior to their arrival in Canada. Allies (2015) claims that in fact, many of them do not recognize what information they need until they spend a period of time struggling to find jobs. Alboim et al. (2005) pointed out that immigrants may not be aware of the worth of their credentials or the necessary steps that they need to take to upgrade their skills so that their human capital can be successfully recognized in the Canadian labour market. Schmidtke (2007) also addresses the lack

9

of knowledge of labour market regulations and the steps to take to enter the particular labour market. Lack of Canadian experience The terms `Canadian experience' and `Canadian work experience' have been used interchangeably because both are mostly used to explain the experience necessary to gain employment opportunity in Canada (Davidson, 2007). When it comes to Canadian experience, it entails a broad range of factors. For example, the direct definition of Canadian experience can be stated as the existence of current or previous work experience in Canada. However, the scholars who are specialized in studying barriers to labour market integration of immigrants consider the much broader understanding of this concept. The following categories can be counted as `Canadian experience': language and communication skills, knowledge of Canadian standards ability to fit into Canadian workplace culture and norms, doing things the `Canadian way'(PanCanadian Sector Council and Immigrant Dialogue, 2005), soft skills including teamwork, leadership, presentations skills, technical and non-technical knowledge, knowledge of business practices and ethical codes (Girard and Bauder, 2005), telephone skills, fluency and absence of accent in language (Hakak et al., 2010), following the dress code/blending in with coworkers, acculturation and assimilation (Lu et al., 2011), and social capital (Pan-Canadian Sector Council and Immigrant Dialogue, 2005). Sakamoto et al. (2013) address that Canadian experience has been identified as a major obstacle for new immigrants who are trying to enter the Canadian labour market. In particular, skilled immigrants who suffered from the difficulties of gaining employment recognize that Canadian experience has subtle meanings behind the words (Sakamoto et al., 2010). They argue that Canadian experience is an elusive but influential factor in immigrants' failure to obtain meaningful employment. It would be comprised of hard skills,

10

and more importantly, soft skills, such as an ability to function within a Canadian workplace environment, an idea that is "tacitly understood within a given context and difficult to articulate" (Sakamoto et al., 2013, p.1). Sakamoto et al. (2010) also testify that some immigrants believe that it serves as a means of exploitation. The authors argue that "employers use Canadian experience as a tool to take advantage of immigrants and obtain free labour" (Sakamoto et al., 2010, p. 146). In this paper, the narrow definition of Canadian experience which means `direct work experience' in the Canadian work environment is utilized, and the other concepts are explained separately as barriers for skilled immigrants who possess post-secondary education and foreign work experience. Empirical research, conducted by Oreopoulos (2011) demonstrates that employers value Canadian experience even more than Canadian education during the process of hiring applicants who have foreign backgrounds. Sakamoto et al. (2013) introduce the term `tacit knowledge' to conceptualize the meaning of Canadian experience. They explain that when employers require Canadian experience, it means that they require both the hard skills and soft skills of the applicants. Hard skills refer to documented or recognized training and knowledge that can be written down on a resume and is, therefore, easier to share, such as educational credentials or recognized certificates or licenses. However, when it comes to soft skills, which consist of elusive concepts that are not spoken, implicit, nor naturally attained, they become difficult to acquire. Sakamoto et al. (2013) argue that these soft skills can be explained as tacit knowledge. They claim that the tacit knowledge in many workplaces can be obtained through learning by doing, on the job or through a contextual and relational learning process such as practicums, internships, mentoring and on-the-job training (Sakamoto et al., 2010). However, unless newcomers are allowed to be in a workplace, tacit knowledge is difficult to obtain. Yet

11

the problem is, Canadian experience is usually recognized as the immigrants' own deficiency (Sakamoto et al., 2013). The authors address that Canadian experience as an employment barrier contributes to high levels of un/underemployment and disproportionate poverty levels that racialized immigrants face in Canada (Sakamoto et al., 2013). In Canada, where multiculturalism is highly esteemed as a national identity, it is generally prohibited to overtly and directly articulate the social undesirability of racialized people. However, as long as such racialized perceptions exist, they are indirectly or covertly internalized, and it is difficult to pinpoint the actual implications of the Canadian experience when it is told to racialized immigrants. Since racialized immigrants are perceived to be deficient from the beginning, without any reference to their racial and social undesirability, but instead to their lack of Canadian experience, the focus on the acquisition of skills seems justified in order to become integrated into the "meritocratic and democratic society" (Sakamoto et al., 2013, p. 7). Consequently, the existence of racism that lies beneath the requirement of Canadian experience is difficult to acknowledge, and it appears that there is no need for structural remedies when the problems lie within the immigrants themselves. Therefore, it becomes easy to blame those individuals who experience discrimination for their state of `otherness' (Sakamoto et al., 2013). Sakamoto et al., (2013) claim that the notion of Canadian experience is deeply interrelated with discourses associated with skilled immigrants and notions of self-reliant immigrants. Under the current neoliberal immigration policy, Canada eagerly accepts immigrants who are well equipped with the required human capital and, who in principle should not need public intervention. Sakamoto et al. (2013) argue that even though there is some sympathy for newly arrived skilled immigrants who have problems entering the labour market, the media suggest that this should not be a burden to Canadian society. Media often advise on several steps immigrants

12

need to take to successfully enter the labour market, but if unsuccessful, they view it essentially as the immigrants' own problem (Sakamoto et al., 2013). This justifies the rhetoric that immigration policy should be more selective to find the right match, and it also serves clear justification for recent directions taken by the Canadian government (Sakamoto et al., 2013). In 2013, the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) announced a new policy, called "Removing the Canadian Experience Barrier." It outlines the recommendations and restrictions for employers based on the Ontario Human Rights Code section 5: prohibiting discrimination in employment based on race, ancestry, colour, place of origin and ethnic origin and section 6: prohibiting discrimination with respect to membership in any trade or occupational association or self-governing profession based on race, ancestry, colour, place of origin and ethnic origin (OHRC, 2013). These sections of the Ontario Human Rights Code are significant steps toward the equitable approach to employment opportunities for immigrants who are seeking gainful employment. However, despite the fact that it offers restrictions and recommendations, there is no practical responsibility or penalty mentioned in this policy, hence, it is not legally binding. Moreover, as previously discussed, the Canadian experience requirement consists of implicit bias and discrimination, which would make it challenging to see the feasible accomplishment of this policy. The policy concludes with the statement below: The OHRC's position is that a strict requirement for Canadian experience is prima facie discrimination (discrimination on its face) and can only be used in limited circumstances. The onus will be on employers and regulatory bodies to show that a requirement for prior work experience in Canada is a bona fide requirement, based on the legal test set out in this policy. Employment and accreditation requirements should be clear, reasonable, genuine and directly related to performing the job (OHRC, 2013, p. 3). Non-recognition of foreign credentials Although one of the major selection criteria under the current immigration policy, with which skilled immigrants were deemed qualified and accepted to Canada for residency, non13

recognition of foreign education degrees and credentials by employers construct a barrier to accessing the Canadian labour market. Reitz (2001) argues that employers demand educational prerequisites and other qualifications for many types of jobs, not only for the licensed trades and professions, but also for regular professions that, are not formally regulated. For foreign-trained professional immigrants, whose occupations are regulated professions in Canada, the process to have their credentials accredited is required. They must earn credits for relevant work experience in their countries of origin and also obtain Canadian recognition of qualification in their professions, which often requires certification examinations (McDade, 1988). Reitz (2001) identifies a number of situations that are related to the recognition of credentials: non-recognition of foreign professional or trade credentials by Canadians; non-recognition of foreign professional or trade credentials by employers, for immigrants who have received Canadian licenses; nonrecognition of foreign occupational credentials by employers in non-licensed occupational fields; discounting foreign-acquired skills not specifically credentialized, but nevertheless deemed relevant to the ability to perform a job; non-recognition of general foreign education by Canadian employers. Reitz (2001) also raises the issue of unequal acknowledgment of the educational quality of immigrants based on their countries of origin. According to Oreopoulos (2011), job applicants with an English-sounding name with a Canadian education received 2.6 times more call backs than those with a foreign sounding name and an Asian education even though the other components in the resumes were exactly the same. Reitz (2003) estimates that the potential loss due to barriers related to qualification recognition would be $15 billion annually. Insufficient language skills Official language proficiency is often discussed as one of the major factors hindering immigrants' access of gaining meaningful occupations. The Conference Board of Canada (2004)

14

revealed that language was the number one barrier to successful employment identified by immigrants. It is well documented that language ability has a direct effect on immigrant earnings. The study found that high proficiency levels in one of Canada's two official languages allowed immigrants to receive higher returns to their foreign obtained human capital (Derwing & Waugh, 2012). Another study by Oreopoulos (2011) reveals that employers are concerned about employee's accents since employees with accents are perceived to have issues when communicating with customers and coworkers. Oreopoulos (2011) demonstrates that candidates with foreign sounding names were overlooked because of the employers' perception that their English language skills may be insufficient on the job site. This may simply be because the employers have a fear that strong accents will not being understood by customers and/or coworkers (Oreopoulos, 2011). From a survey of employers and employees, Allies (2015) reveals that there is a large gap between employers and employees regarding the perception of the importance of language proficiency in the labour market. A total of 95 percent of employers interviewed for this study reported that language and communications skills form a barrier for newcomers seeking employment in Ontario, as opposed to the 27 percent of newcomers who believe that they are barriers. Although it is hard to agree that only one-third of immigrants recognize language as a barrier, it is apparent that employers consider language and communication skills as a prime issue in employment. In addition to the perception that language skills are less than adequate, the requirement of language proficiency can serve as another source of discrimination toward immigrants. Munro (2003) argues that foreign accents can create `accent stereotyping' toward certain groups of people and may lead to discriminatory behavior toward particular groups. Also, some people do not favor accented speech, not only because it is

15

hard to comprehend, but also because it is associated with the belief that a foreign accent is a type of speech defect and people with accents are deemed less intelligent (Munro, 2003). Thus, immigrants are blamed for having an accent; rather than acknowledging the structural and systemic forms of discrimination in the Canadian labour market. Lack of social capital It is often addressed that immigrants may experience disadvantages because they do not have social capital, such as networks linking them to information about job opportunities (Reitz, 2007). Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992, p.119) define social capital as, "the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutional relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition." Kunz (2003) claims that social capital is just as important as human capital for successful integration into the labour market. In the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (LSIC) data analysis, Grenier & Xue (2010) demonstrates that personal networks facilitate faster access to the intended occupation. It is strongly recommended to build networks as much as possible. Based on qualitative research, the Conference Board of Canada (2004) emphasized that regardless of the characteristics of the network; internal or external, professional or personal, social capital plays a significant role in visible minorities' success at work. Nakhaie and Abdolmohammad (2012) also suggest that social capital can generally serve a positive role in job attainment for new immigrants; even though there is a risk of deterring social inclusion of immigrants depending on the forms of social capital in which they are involved. For example, ethnic enclaves act as a hindrance for the integration of immigrants into mainstream Canadian society (Kwak, 2004). Today's immigrants to Canada are more educated, and so they seek more skilled positions in the labour market. Many have the education, experience and language skills to apply

16

in the workforce but lack the social capital, the connections, and networks they need to increase the prospects of a successful job search. Mentoring is suggested as one way of overcoming this barrier (Affiliation of Multicultural and Social Service Agencies of British Columbia, 2006) Racial discrimination As observed, discrimination based on race is broadly embedded in most of the barriers that hamper gaining access to employment for new immigrants. Schmidtke (2007) criticizes that although Canada has been successful in banning overt forms of racism from public life, hidden discrimination against visible minorities continues to play a critical role in the labour market. Lack of `Canadian experience,' not `fitting in,' absence of `cultural competence' are some examples of rhetoric used with immigrants who possess a non-European background. Under these circumstances, immigrants are often subjected to exploitation and receive considerably lower incomes than their Canadian-born cohorts (Schmidtke, 2007). As discrimination takes a more implicit form in our society, it is hard to pinpoint specific situations in which immigrants experience discrimination in the labour market. However, there is some evidence, which testifies that this may be an important indicator affecting immigrants' poor employment outcomes. As briefly mentioned earlier, Oreopoulos (2011), in a resume-sending experiment, shows that job applicants with English-sounding names are about 40 percent more likely to receive a call back for an interview than applicants with ethnic sounding names. This result reveals the interrelation with language-based discrimination because the employers answered that the reason for favoring English-sounding names is because they often treat the name as an indicator that an applicant lacks critical language skills for the job. Based upon data from the 1996 and 2001 censuses and other labour market statistics, Teelucksingh and Galabuzi (2005) outlined the racially discriminative nature of the Canadian labour market: they found that during the census period,

17

racialized groups and new immigrants continued in a double-digit income gap and a higher rate of unemployment. Also, they found that the labour market segmentation was different depending on racial groups. For example, people from racialized groups were over-represented in many low-paying occupations with a high level of instability, and they were under-represented in the better, secure jobs. They addressed that the income disparity can be linked to labour market discrimination. Conclusively, Teelucksingh and Galabuzi (2005) argue that racial discrimination continues to be a major factor in the Canadian labour market and it affects the life of racialized people and immigrants in Canada, including their health. Reitz (2005) suggests that ethnic and racial stereotypes may affect perceptions of immigrants' qualifications and subsequently, the policy process based on this perception will pose an effect in the minority status of immigrants. He argues that the issue of race and employment has been a part of the debate over employment equity in Canada. However, due to the controversial nature of this debate, the policy outcomes have been weak (Reitz, 2005). 2.3. Economic and social consequences It is apparent that the under-utilization of skilled immigrants' human capital causes adverse impacts not only on immigrants, but also on society (Davidson, 2007). For example, the Conference Board of Canada Report estimates that the Canadian economy loses between 4.1 billion and 5.9 billion annually due to skill under-utilization. Reitz (2001) also estimates that there is an annual $2 billion of potential income loss due to the under-utilization of human capital. Other impacts can be a loss of potential tax revenue due to un/under employment of skilled immigrants, poverty and social welfare cost, social inclusion issue and health problems of immigrants (Davidson, 2007; Block & Galabuzi, 2011). 2.4. Mentoring programs in settlement sector

18

Mentoring is a relationship that is designed with the intention of being mutually beneficial to the mentor and mentee, as well as the organization (Kram, 1985). In general, mentoring is a helping relationship. It has been called a process in which a more experienced individual, the mentor, helps guide a newcomer or a less experienced individual in advancing their own career (Kram, 1985). Current research on mentoring has introduced different forms of mentoring, such as formal and informal mentoring, peer mentoring, and group mentoring (Broitman, 2000). Mentoring programs in the settlement sector, which started in 2003, are a relatively recent service for immigrants to tackle the issue of the lack of Canadian experience and social capital that immigrants confront (Shan & Butterwick, 2016). In 2002, the Maytree Foundation, a private Canadian charitable foundation, envisioned a service system for the country to maximize the integration of skilled immigrants. Among others, it proposed formal mentorship programs as a possible means of integrating immigrants (Alboim, 2002). The objective of this initiative is to give under- or unemployed skilled immigrants the access to a person employed in the occupation for which they are trained. The mentor shares professional networks and offers guidance through the job search and/or the licensing process; the job-seeking immigrant gains a greater understanding of a specific occupational context and its trends. Although finding employment opportunities for the immigrant is not the ultimate objective in the mentor's scope of work, participating immigrants are able to often secure positions in their field (Alboim & McIsaac, 2007). Mentoring programs have been practiced by a number of community-based agencies. They also ensure that a close occupational fit exists between mentor and skilled immigrant worker and that both parties have clear expectations of the match. Finally, they provide training, support, and monitoring of the matches (Alboim & McIsaac, 2007).

19

With mentorship programs, immigrants are paired with volunteer mentors in corresponding professional fields, meeting once a week for two hours for a period of four months. Training is given to mentors on their roles, the resources they could use and how they can help new immigrants learn about Canadian workplace culture, build their professional networks, improve their professional English, practice self-marketing techniques, and identify potential employers. Shan & Butterwick (2016) argue that while mentors are encouraged to respond to the needs of newcomers and not just provide a checklist of information, the structure, and orientation of this program remains, to some extent, associated with a one-way approach to integrating newcomers into the host society. Regarding the outcomes of the mentorship program for skilled immigrants, Zikic (2015), who directed the research conducted by York University with the collaboration of the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC), claimed that mentees gained profound knowledge on the local labour market and job search strategies through the mentoring program. With the assistance of mentors, mentees were able to expand their social network and meet other local professionals. The author also testified that the most powerful outcome of the program for mentees was that mentees were motivated to feel ready and confident to confront job search challenges (Zikic, 2015). Through the mentoring relationship, mentors also experienced improvement in their leadership skills. However, the much more powerful outcome was that the mentors attained direct knowledge about the perils that newcomers go through in the local labour market (Zikic, 2015). It is apparent that the mentors learned not only about the diversity in the labour market but also about the human side of suffering and the resilience needed to overcome these barriers. Shan & Butterwick (2016) also claimed that mentors experienced critical social change through the program. For example, mentors could re-assess their preconceived

20

assumptions about the immigrants, and sometimes they unlearned certain social stereotypes (Shan & Butterwick, 2016). This experience in shifted perceptions of mentors/employers toward newcomers is positive, and overtime, it can contribute to lowering the employment barriers that are hindering the integration of immigrants. Conclusively, Ontario Roundtable (Ontario, 2012) recommends that a greater emphasis on developing "soft skills" is required for skilled immigrants entering the Canadian labour market. Practical employment programs such as mentorship programs should be expanded because they have proven effective in helping new immigrants attain additional skills needed to meet employers' expectations and to integrate into the labour market at a level commensurate with their professional expertise (Ontario, 2012). 2.5. Online mentoring program Advances in technology and the popularity of the internet have facilitated globalization and generated new businesses (Ensher et al., 2003). It also created a wide variety of innovative work practices and positions. Current estimates indicate that there are approximately 228 million people who access the internet in English alone (Global Reach, 2002). The internet has increased a variety of venues, including chat rooms, newsgroups, mailing lists, interactive websites, and text-based virtual environments (Parks & Roberts, 1998). These media, collectively known as computer-mediated communication (CMC) and other forms of technology have contributed to greater career mobility, an increasing emphasis on project work, virtual organizations, and boundary-less careers (Sullivan, 1999). Kram and Hall (1996) claim that within the changing career environment, knowledge workers would find that relying on a network of mentors to navigate organizational and career paths can be a significant strategic advantage.

21

Ensher et al. (2003) propose five strengths associated with online mentoring. First, increased accessibility to one another and the sheer convenience is a significant opportunity for online mentors and mentees. CMC decreases the need for communicators to share time and space (Ensher et al., 2003). For example, email and social media allow communicators to exchange information and advice at their convenience, whenever they have the time to read and respond to their messages. A second opportunity related to online mentoring is the potential for reduced costs in terms of time and money. One of the major reasons why online training is increasing is due to a reduction in costs as training online allows a trainer to teach more people from one location and reduces travel costs (Kiser, 1999). The third opportunity for mentors and mentees would be the equalized status between mentors and mentees as typically mentors are of higher status than mentees. CMC reduces social cues among the communicators (Sproull & Keisler, 1986). People do not see the superficial characteristics of the people with whom they communicate. Therefore, communicators are less likely to categorize others or treat them differently based on these characteristics (Schuler, 1996). A fourth opportunity for online mentors and mentees is the reduced importance of demographics. One of the advantages of an internet relationship is that it changes the focus from the impression of appearances to inner idea and feelings (Toufexis, 1996). Hence, individuals may be more likely to develop relationships with one another based on commonality of interests or goals, rather than on stereotypes or assumptions caused by initial impressions of salient demographic characteristics (e.g., age, race, and gender) (Ensher et al., 2003). Finally, the author testifies that the online mentoring can provide a structured system and a historical record of interactions between mentees and mentors, which can be especially useful for mentees in formal mentoring programs (Ensher et al., 2003). 2.6. Online mentoring for settlement sector

22

As discussed, online mentoring serves numerous benefits as a substitute or reinforcement of existing mentoring services. More importantly, considering the economic dependency of nonprofit service providers on public funding which seems to be the root of many problems faced by non-profit service providers, cost-effectiveness is one of the priorities that the service providers should consider (Shields, 2016). Online mentoring is an efficient tool the service providers can utilize with lower cost (Ensher et al., 2003). In addition, there is a strong need for community outreach strategies that enable non-profit agencies to better serve those immigrants with very limited social resources (Sidhu & Taylor, 2016). If service providers can offer online-based mentoring services, it will provide more accessibility to both mentors and those being mentored. Moreover, according to Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants (OCASI) (2012)'s report, the vast majority of respondents who reported using employment and skills training programs and services used employment support services such as resume and cover letter preparation, job interviewing (70.8 percent), and to a lesser extent, accreditation or academic services (17.6 percent), bridge training programs for internationally-trained professionals in a regulated profession or trade (13.7 percent), and mentoring and internship programs (12.8 percent). It demonstrates that fewer immigrants used mentoring programs compared to other employment services. When it comes to the degree of satisfaction of the program, mentoring and internship programs got 57.5 percent whereas bridge training program received 66.1 percent and self-employed or business development programs/training received 72.8 percent (OCASI, 2012). Although there may be various reasons for comparatively lower usage and satisfaction of the mentoring programs, considering that the online mentoring programs can provide a wider range of tools to increase the interaction, usage, and promotion, it will play a positive role to improve the overall quality and capacity of mentoring services. Furthermore, the current lack of

23

coordination between non-profit service providers hinders their ability to create and facilitate sustainable links with immigrant groups (Shields, 2016). Through connecting online service networks among service providers, collaborated mentoring services will be achievable. Alboim & McIsaac (2007) also claim that creating a strong pool of mentors has been a challenge due to lack of funding for marketing and mentor outreach. Online mentoring will enable group mentoring through online platforms and maximize the efficiency of mentors and organizations. In addition, recent immigrants who arrived in Canada since 1995 who have online access have higher levels of online activity than earlier immigrants and Canadian-born residents (Haighta, 2014; Veenhof et al., 2008). Particularly, 58.8 percent of recent immigrants, compared with 30.7 percent of Canadian-born cohorts, used the internet for job search. (Veenhof, et al., 2008). Finally, Wellman et al. (2016) testify that the internet can be a useful tool to build and maintain social capital when people use it for communication and coordination with friends, relatives, and organizations near and far. Lin (2009) also claimed that the internet based groups have the potential to help the settlement process of immigrants. When it comes to the use of online tools, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) (2015) addresses the development of online service delivery models, or sector supports to improve the effectiveness or efficiency of service to newcomers as one of the regional priorities of Ontario. Furthermore, CIC outlines the adaptation of emerging technologies in settlement programs: Emerging technologies such as mobile applications, use of open data, social media and other technology-based solutions have potential to improve settlement outcomes through increasing awareness, learning, making connections in communities and other areas. As new technologies emerge their relevance in the settlement sector can also be considered (CIC, 2015, p. 43).

24

In conclusion, the literature review claims that diverse socioeconomic and structural barriers have devalued the human capital of skilled immigrants and impeded the integration into the Canadian labour market. The scholarly research considered also suggests that the role of the settlement sector is to tackle the barriers lying in front of skilled immigrants. In particular, this study focuses on mentoring services. Mentoring programs are not only an effective tool for new immigrants to help build social networks and gain access to employment in the mainstream Canadian labour market but they also have the potential to diminish structural barriers by shifting employers' perception towards immigrants. Finally, the adaptation of online tools in the settlement sector is still in its infancy, however, it is imperative to find solutions to maximize the outcomes of the service in the era of neoliberalism, where resources to serve immigrants are limited.

Chapter 3. Online Mentoring Program for Skilled Korean Immigrants 3.1. Korean immigrants, the facts The Korean community in Canada is known as one of the fastest growing groups compared to the overall population. According to Lindsay (2007), the increase rate of the Korean population between 1996 and 2001 was 53 percent as opposed to that of the overall Canadian population which was only 4 percent. Among the Korean population, the vast majority of Korean immigrants were born outside of Canada. In particular, among foreign-born Korean immigrants in Canada, 60 percent of them have arrived within the last ten years. The context of this steep increase of Korean immigrants to Canada will be discussed later. The statistics reveal that another 36 percent of immigrants arrived in Canada between 1971 and 1990, and only 4 percent had moved to Canada before 1971 (Lindsay, 2007). The Korean population possesses comparatively a high level of education. It was indicated that in 2001, 37 percent of Korean adults were university graduates whereas 15 percent of the overall Canadian adult population had university degrees (Statistics Canada, 2007). Song (2010) explains the phenomenon of recent Korean immigrants in Canada showing outstanding features compared to the previous arrivals. About 80 percent of total Korean immigrants have immigrated under the economic class, which is comprised of skilled workers and business applicants. This class of Korean applicants require high human capital or a substantial amount of financial assets (Song, 2010). Kwak (2008) claims that in comparison to the immigrants from the top ten source countries, Korean immigrants show the highest proportion of those who had a university degree or higher education at the time of landing. Their high educational qualifications would have led to achieving middle socioeconomic class in their home country. Yoon (2004) claims that recent Korean immigrants in Toronto who arrived after 1997 were in the middle class when they were in Korea. Also, the

26

majority of them had post-secondary education and work experience in professional and whitecollar occupations in Korea. All in all, recent Korean immigrants are well equipped with either high human capital or financial capital, which qualifies them according to the requirement of contemporary Canadian immigration policy. Despite the Korean immigrants are being adorned with outstanding qualifications, statistics data disclosed disappointing results in their socio-economic performance. According to Lindsay (2007), Canadians of Korean origin have an employment rate of 51 percent, as opposed to the overall employment rate of 62 percent for Canadians. When comparison is done by age, the gap between the employment rate of Canadians of Korean origin and the rest of the population becomes larger. For example, the employment rate of Korean immigrants aged 25 to 44 was 59 percent, whereas that of the overall Canadian cohorts was 80 percent (Lindsay, 2007). Block and Galabuzi (2011) reveal an even worse situation for the Korean immigrants through analysis of the 2006 Census data. According to their analysis, Koreans, as an ethnic group, have the lowest labour market participation rate of 54.8 percent out of an average of 67.3 percent and the lowest employment rate of 50.1 percent compared to 61.5 percent. When it comes to income level, based on data from the year 2000, the Korean ethnic group's average yearly earning was just over $20,000, and it was $10,000 less than the figure for the overall Canadian population (Lindsay, 2007). Block and Galabuzi (2011) also demonstrate that the average employment income of Koreans is the lowest among all ethnic groups with incomes of $25,929 versus the average of $30,385. Moreover, the Korean ethnic group's earnings in 2005 have dropped 4.6 percent compared to 2000, and this is the biggest decrease among ethnic groups. On the contrary, earnings of the non-racialized group in this period have increased 2.7 percent (Block and Galabuzi, 2011). Lindsay (2007) indicates that a relatively large proportion of Koreans are

27

experiencing poor living conditions with 43 percent of the Korean community falling below the official Low-Income Cut-Off line (LICO), while 16 percent of the overall Canadian population falls below of LICO. Although this labour market disparity for racialized populations is generally a debated phenomenon for most of the visible minority population, the poor income statistics for Koreans was significant since most of the Korean immigrants were in the middle class prior to emigrating and they were financially stable when they started their life in Canada. Considering that employment income level is generally used as an indicator of successful integration of immigrants (Alboim et al., 2005), it is valid to argue that Korean immigrants are not successfully integrating into Canadian society. 3.2. Historical overview of Korean immigration to Canada Korean migration to Canada has shown steady growth since the official commencement of immigration of Koreans in 1962. There are four major time periods of changes in Korean immigration mainly due to the change of Canadian immigration policies: before 1976, 19771985, 1986-2001 and 2002-present. During the first period, the significant reason for immigration was for the pursuit of better economic opportunities. Since 1967, with the introduction of the points system, more Korean immigrants moved to Canada. Those Korean immigrants consisted of Koreans who were living in Vietnam, South America, and Germany. A visible Korean community was established in this period. During the second period, there was a change of policy, which excluded siblings and other relatives from the family reunification category, and there was a slight decrease in the number of Korean immigrants. The third period started with a steady increase. It is noteworthy that in 1986, a newly revised business immigration program prompted a large influx of immigrants from East Asian countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea. This revision to the Canadian immigration policy was attractive

28

to those who possessed financial capital. Since 1997, the number of skilled Korean immigrants has been increased enormously (Kwak, 2008). This rapid increase in the number of Skilled Korean worker immigrants was mainly due to the economic crisis in Korea which happened in 1997. In order to escape from the unstable socio-economic conditions in Korea on one hand, and to look for a better country for their children's education and their future on the other hand, highly-educated middle-class families began an `exodus' from Korea. Those who could arrange migration to Canada were typically skilled/professional workers or wealthy immigrants who could satisfy the requirements for human capital or financial capital. The data from the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Korean MOFAT, 2008) shows that in 1999, the number of Korean emigrants who reported their landing destination as Canada surpassed those who emigrating to the United States (which was the most favoured destination for Koreans for almost 35 years), and the trend lasted until 2003 (Kwak, 2008). During the fourth period, Korean immigration was affected by the revised immigration policy of 2002, which required higher proficiency in the official languages for skilled workers and a minimum one year of actual business experience for the business immigration category. There was a decrease of immigration until 2004 due to this stricter language requirement, but it began to recover in 2005. Meanwhile, there was a rapid growth of temporary status holders, which suggests some Koreans came to Canada on a temporary permit first and then applied for immigration after improving their qualifications (Song, 2010). Conclusively, unprecedented growth out of the four periods has emerged since the late 1990s. Although there has been a decrease after 2004, 4,000 to 6,000 Koreans yearly have attained permanent residency in Canada. The Korean immigrants who have arrived in Canada since 1996 comprise a majority of the population, accounting for 42.1 percent of the Korean population who immigrated to Canada between 1962 and 2005 (Song, 2010).

29

3.3. Employment related issues of Korean immigrants and the responses With the massive influx of highly skilled Korean immigrants since the late 1990s, it was expected that they would immediately contribute to the Canadian labour market with credentials for work. However, as examined earlier, the performance of Korean immigrants in the Canadian labour market has not reached anticipated levels of success. When it comes to the difficulties that racialized immigrants experience in the Canadian labour market, there are commonly discussed factors such as lack of Canadian experience, insufficient official language proficiency, nonrecognition of foreign education and foreign work experience, racial discrimination, lack of social capital, and insufficient support system for immigrants (Hong, 2008; Kwak, 2004; Song, 2010). Skilled Korean immigrants are not exempted from those barriers. Particularly, for skilled Korean immigrants, Song (2010) claims that the language barrier is often regarded as the first, and the biggest barrier, which most internationally trained professional immigrants experience, and it also affects almost every aspect of Korean immigrants' daily lives, limiting their social relations. Although recent Korean immigrants have shown improved language facility compared to their predecessors, still language proficiency appears within the major challenges of the immigration experience for Koreans (Kim, 2007). Language barriers are often strongly intertwined with unemployment, so their limited language facility serves as a primary cause of Korean immigrants' hardship and hindering job opportunities (Song, 2010). Although they left Korea with the hope of a better quality of life for their family, many Korean immigrants begin to realize that it is not easy to integrate into Canadian society with their educational background and work experience from Korea and try to find solutions. Park (2016) reveals the responses from her research: some immigrants went to Canadian post-secondary institutions to upgrade their qualifications or increase their opportunities for employment. Some

30

immigrants were unable to obtain a gainful job in their area of expertise in the Canadian labour market, so they turned to opening their own businesses. The Korean population in Canada has become well known for its high level of self-employment, mainly family business arrangements (Lindsay, 2007). Song (2010) argues that this is the typical mode of modified adaptation of skilled Korean immigrants. Lindsay (2007) illustrates that 31 percent of the employed Korean population is self-employed as opposed to 12 percent of the overall self-employed population. In fact, the self-employment rate of Korean immigrants in Canada is over 30 percent compared to only 15 percent of the general Canadian population (Lindsay, 2007) It also discloses significant data regarding unpaid family employees. It states that in 2001, two percent of all workers in Canada designated as unpaid family employees were Korean in origin, whereas the Korean population made up only 0.3 percent of the total Canadian workforce. Again, this data illustrates that many Korean families are involved in small family owned businesses. The five typical business types for Korean immigrants are grocery, smoke shop, coffee and sandwich shop, coin laundry and dry cleaning (Kwak, 2004). Kwak (2002) introduces disadvantage theory (Light, Portes and Bach, as cited in Kwak, 2002) which views the high rate of self-employment among immigrants as a reaction to barriers in the labour market. Due to language barriers, lack of recognition of credentials and work experience, discrimination, and other disadvantages, those who are unable to find gainful employment seek alternatives through self-employment. In particular, limited information shared within the local Korean ethnic community and failure to obtain information and services from multicultural settlement agencies affected their decision opting for self-employment (Kwak, 2002; Park, 2016). This highlights the needs of integrated support to help skilled Korean immigrants get access to the information and services related to

31

the integration into the Canadian labour market which is available from various settlement service providers. As Breton (2003) illustrated, skilled immigrants choose the self-employment option as a defensive structuring because they face various barriers. Kwak (2002) also illustrates this phenomenon with 'blocked mobility theory' (Li, 2000), which explains that the disadvantaged group tries to achieve social and economic mobility by participating in entrepreneurial activities since improving their socio-economic status is difficult otherwise (Kwak, 2002). Another response to the harsh reality of entering the Canadian labour market is that people stop focusing on getting employment in their perspective industries that they have education and training in. A number of highly skilled immigrants tend to use less established formal or informal ethnic networks to find employment opportunities when their foreign experience and credentials are not recognized by Canadian employers (Salaff et al., 2003). After realizing that it is hard to find a job that commensurates with their qualifications, they decide to take any jobs available for survival and experience downward mobility. Many of them seek job opportunities within the Korean ethnic community because they lack confidence using English and lack social capital in Canada (Park, 2016). Yoon (2004) argues that working in the Korean ethnic economy and utilizing Korean social networks are typical survival strategies. The author also claims that three-quarters of Korean immigrants in Toronto are involved in the Korean ethnic economy (Yoon, 2004). Park (2016) argues that those who are experiencing downward mobility do not have the opportunity to interact with Canadians of other ethnic origins. Also, they have no interest in social or political issues in Canada. Finally, many Korean families choose to become transnational families. As explained earlier, advanced communication, finance, and transportation system allow increased mobility to

32

immigrant families. Hong (2008) argues that Korean middle-class families believe that providing their children global competency through English and an educational investment in North American education may secure their families' - and especially their children's - social status. However, as Korean immigrant families experienced severe downward mobility in Canada, they were forced to choose alternative survival strategies. This practice has led to the creation of `transnational families,' where mothers stay in Canada with their children for the educational benefits, forcing fathers to go back to Korea for financial support. This type of family, referred to as a `Kirogi family,' meaning goose family, is only achievable when the father has enough income and ability to support both his family and himself. This arrangement requires the sacrifice of all family members and often causes issues for the family (Hong, 2008). Consequently, many Korean immigrant parents of transnational families plan to go back to Korea once their children become college students because they did not have a chance to integrate into Canadian society (Yoon, 2014). However, the flip side of such a family rearrangement is that it can be attributed to the exclusion of skilled immigrants from the Canadian labour market since it is almost impossible for the male breadwinner to maintain his economic status in Canada (Hong, 2008). Considering that the dominant number of settlement processes of Korean immigrants was made through limited information within the ethnic community (Park, 2016), it is safe to conclude that fewer number of families will choose to be transnational families if they were exposed and connected to more information and services related to the access to Canadian labour market. 3.4. Needs of dedicated employment program for skilled Korean immigrants There is a significant need of effort to motivate integration of skilled Korean immigrants into the Canadian labour market. Having discussed above, Koreans, as an ethnic group, shows

33

comparatively worse economic outcomes in Canadian economy compared to other ethnic groups (Canada.ca, 2013; Lindsay, 2007). Most Korean immigrants experience downward mobility, reside in ethnic enclaves, become entrepreneurs, and develop into transnational families mainly due to the barriers such as low language skills, non-recognition of credentials and lack of Canadian experience (Chan and Fong, 2012; Lindsay, 2007). It is apparent that certain measures should be employed to address these issues directly. Also, Korean immigrants have been heavily influenced by other Korean immigrant cohorts in terms of jobs and the business categories they are involved in (Kwak, 2004). It would be a likely assumption that the path of a skilled immigrant might have changed if he or she had a chance to be connected with a skilled Korean immigrant who has successfully entered into the Canadian labour market and obtained advice from this successful predecessor. Particularly, it is difficult for skilled Korean immigrants to be involved in existing mentoring programs designed for skilled immigrants due to the narrow scope of requirements. For example, in order to be eligible for the mentoring program, a high level of English skill (CLB 7+) is required (TRIEC, 2011). Considering the fact that English is recognized as a major hindrance for the integration of skilled Korean immigrants into the Canadian labour market, the high language proficiency requirement for the mentoring program is a stumbling block to skilled Korean immigrants. Mentoring services for skilled Korean immigrants who possess a low level of English proficiency will help provide the opportunity and hope to challenge themselves to achieve a higher goal of gaining access to the mainstream Canadian labour market. In addition, although they are mainly ethnic language websites, the internet is considered to be a major information source for Korean immigrants during their settlement process (Yoon, 2017). An ethnic language internet based service, which offers linkage to mainstream Canadian labour market and ultimately to Canadian society through the

34

collaboration with Korean ethnic internet media, is a worthy consideration. Furthermore, the Korean ethnic group has a collectivistic, high-context cultural orientation which affects communication and style of social networking, as such, the social networking and communication need to be addressed accordingly. Park & Jun (2003) claims that people from a collectivistic, high-context culture are deeply involved with each other with high levels of social bonds, commitment, and harmony and develop a shared understanding of symbols and codes for communications. It is demonstrated that people from the collectivistic, high-context culture view the internet as a means of social interaction, whereas people from the individualistic, low-context culture use the internet as a medium for information seeking and gaining (Chau et al., 2002). Finally, it is well documented that the social network and support from people of the same ethnic background is very effective in helping immigrants deal with acculturation stress and in maintaining good health and well-being (Noh & Kaspar, 2005; Ye, 2006). Particularly, various socio-cultural factors, such as the language barrier and employment-related difficulties forced the Korean ethnic group to remain in high levels of ethnic attachment and low levels of assimilation (Chan & Fong, 2012; Hurh and Kim, 1984). However, it is hard to find well-organized employment services and employment related information for the Korean ethnic community from either online or offline services. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a bridge to connect the Korean ethnic community with mainstream society by offering ethno specific programing mainly focusing on this purpose.

Chapter 4. Case Studies 4.1. Case Study I: The mentoring partnership by Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC) As discussed earlier, improving social capital is crucial for skilled immigrants to obtain employment (Kunz, 2003). Mentoring programs are recommended by the government and some of the scholarly literature as a useful tool to help skilled immigrants build social networks, gain knowledge of the Canadian work environment and increase job accessibility commensurate with their human capital (Alboim & McIsaac, 2007; Allies, 2015; Conference Board, 2004; Ontario, n.d.). The Mentoring Partnership is operated by the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC), and this service was introduced by the government of Ontario's mentoring program information website, as well as the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)1 and City of Toronto websites (IRCC, n.d.; Ontario, n.d.; Toronto, n.d.). TRIEC is a nonprofit organization founded in 2002 for the purpose of dealing with immigrant employment issues. The Mentoring Partnership program was launched by TRIEC in 2004 and is geared toward building occupation-specific mentoring relationships between newly arrived skilled immigrants and established professionals. The biggest strength of this program is that it works collaboratively with 15 major employment service providers including Accessible Community Counselling and Employment Services (ACCES Employment), COSTI, JVS Toronto and major community colleges and universities (Mentoring Partnership, n.d.). TRIEC acts as a coordinator between employer partners and service delivery partner organizations. They provide a centralized database so that service delivery partners can find

matching mentors. Moreover, the Mentoring Partnership program provides professional development opportunities to mentors so that they can improve their mentoring skills. According to their website (www.mentoringpartnership.ca), the professional development sessions include workshops, webinars, and e-learning modules that mentors can access during the four months of the mentoring period (Mentoring Partnership, n.d.). Fifteen service delivery partners (mostly employment service agencies) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) recruit mentees and match them with mentors who are recruited by TRIEC. They arrange event sessions such as orientations and workshops, support mentoring relationships, and track the outcomes to assess the effectiveness of these relationships. Employer partners participate in the program by encouraging their employees to become mentors and hosting orientation events for their mentors. According to TRIEC, currently, over 50 employer organizations have participated and promoted mentoring programs to their staff (Mentoring Partnership, n.d.). Individuals who are interested in the mentoring program can join this program by applying to one of the service delivery partner agencies. The agencies find matching mentors appropriate for the occupation and industry, as well as, educational background. Once mentors and mentees are matched, they participate in an orientation session and continue a one-on-one mentoring relationship for a total of 24 hours over a period of four months (Mentoring Partnership, n.d.). The eligibility of mentees is limited to skilled immigrants who have more than three years of experience in his/her profession in the country of origin. Also, the potential mentee should have landed in Canada no more than five years before he/she apply for the mentoring program. More importantly, in order to be eligible for the program, mentee candidates should possess a high level of English proficiency (CLB 7-8) (TRIEC, 2011; TRIEC, n.d.). The Mentoring Partnership announced that they had achieved 12,000 mentoring matches in 2016 and

37

over 7,600 volunteer mentors have participated in the program since its inception in 2004 (Mentoring Partnership, n.d.). 4.2. Case Study II: MentorCity, the online mentoring service provider MentorCity (www.mentorcity.com) is a commercial online mentoring service mainly focusing on career development. It provides a free online mentoring service for individuals, and it also provides an online mentoring platform to companies and organizations who are interested in setting up an internal mentoring service system (MentorCity, n.d.). MentorCity claims that its online mentoring programs connect clients' members to meaningful relationships through their self-directed and comprehensive programs (MentorCity, n.d.). They also argue that their mentoring platform is designed to save clients' time and money by minimizing their matching responsibilities and allowing program administrator(s) to focus their efforts on creating a mentoring culture and ensuring that program objectives are achieved (MentorCity, n.d.). MentorCity's online mentoring platform is comprised of profile set up, mentor-mentee matching algorithm, message exchange tools, event promotion, a process management tool, resources, a program evaluation tool, and a database (MentorCity, n.d.). For example, a program evaluation tool, which produces diverse statistics and charts based on the data accumulated in the database, will save time in producing the report. It is notable that the online mentoring platform will increase the efficiency of the facilitator of the mentoring program. In addition, MentorCity's platform provides a linkage to Skype for one-on-one or group mentoring. Furthermore, the additional merit of the program is that they provide resources, tips, and training to help service users. They claim that the platform is compatible with mobile devices as they employ a responsive design. All in all, MentorCity demonstrates the plausible merit of an online mentoring

38

service through diverse communication channels between mentors and mentees, linkage to resources, and increased efficiency of management tools.

Chapter 5. Grant Proposal 5.1. Introduction to the proposal The present proposal is designed under the permission and guidance of the KCWA. The target community and the services that KCWA offers aligns with the main purpose of this study. In my discussions with KCWA, the Ontario Trillium Foundation's (OTF) granting program was chosen as the funder organization to apply for this grant proposal. This section further discusses the components of the program to provide a better context of the proposal. Target Population As a primary target population, this program aims to serve skilled Korean immigrants, who possess credentials from a university and work experience from Korea. Particularly those who experience difficulty entering the Canadian labour market due to well-known barriers such as lack of English proficiency, Canadian experience, and social network will be considered as the major target population. In addition, the skilled immigrants who failed the eligibility requirement of existing mentoring programs offered by other settlement service providers due to insufficient English skill level and who have surpassed the length of residency in Canada will be accepted as primary service recipients. As a secondary target group, immigrants in Korea before arrival to Canada, Korean immigrants in other provinces, Canadian citizenship holders, and international students living in Ontario or other provinces who are planning to apply for permanent residency in Canada will be included as service recipients. This secondary target group may have a partial limitation on available services they can use depending on their geographical location and immigration status.

Grantee: KCWA Family and Social Services KCWA is a non-profit settlement service organization that was founded in 1985. It aims to provide a one-stop settlement service for ethnic Koreans in a manner that is culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate (KCWA, n.d.). On average, the KCWA delivers around 30,000 service encounters per year and in addition offers numerous classes, workshops, and lectures on subjects like English-language training and job search techniques. For over 30 years, the KCWA has played a vital role as it has worked to improve the quality of life of the Korean community in Ontario (Heritage Toronto, n.d.). Their services mainly cover employment services, family services, health services, settlement services, and social services (211 Toronto, n.d.). Funder: Ontario Trillium Foundation As one of the Government of Ontario agencies, OTF provides funding to organizations to support community growth. OTF is known as one of Canada's largest granting foundations, and it has been awarding funding for the development and sustainability of strong communities in Ontario for over 30 years. With the budget of more than $136 million, every year, OTF continues to release funding to over 1,300 charities and non-profit organizations (NPOs) enabling them to deliver their services to enhance community function and support. Organizations can receive $5,000 to $500,000 per year to contribute to community building projects which address six key action areas which are of increased significance to the health and ongoing wellness of Ontario communities (Ontario Trillium Foundation, n.d.). Six key action areas that OTF established to identify themes and projects which would provide benefits to a range of Ontarians include Active People (supporting physical activity and healthy lifestyles); Connected People (fostering a collaborative, inclusive community); Green
41

People (supporting a sustainable environment and impact reductions); Inspired People (building an appreciation for culture, arts, and heritage); Prosperous People (providing greater economic opportunities and sustainability); and Promising Young People (development of children and youth to make next steps) (Ontario Trillium Foundation, n.d.). OTF suggests four investment streams of funding which applicants can apply for depending on the nature of their project: 1. Seed Grants: $5,000-75,000 to projects at the idea/conceptual stage (1 year max); 2. Grow Grants: $50,000-250,000/year to build on the success of a proven or existing model/program (2-3 years); 3. Capital Grants: $5,000-150,000 to broaden access to and improving community spaces (1 year max); and 4. Collective Impact Grants: $500k/year to bring about fundamental change with collective action (up to 5 years). All four streams operate independently, with their own program focus, eligibility criteria, and application timelines. It is recommended that the applicants identify their projects from the six key action areas and acknowledge the funding needs would be satisfied by one of the investment streams (Casemore, 2017). This proposal aligns with the category of `Connected People' among the six key action areas because this action area mainly focuses on the notion of sense of belonging and creating a more inclusive community by providing engagement opportunities to diverse groups. In addition, this action area seeks the funding initiative that reaches out to, and encourages the participation of, individuals who are isolated or marginalized. Enhanced Mentoring Program (EMP) Notwithstanding the mentoring programs offered by settlement service providers, most of the services are focusing on face-to-face and one-on-one connection between mentors and mentees. A handful of pre-arrival settlement service providers use online based mentoring

42

services for immigrants who have not yet arrived in Canada. Still, their mentoring services are mainly relying on conventional mentoring concepts that depend on a one on one transaction between a mentor and a mentee. The main concept of the EMP is to provide internet-based integrated employment services on top of the conventional mentoring program. The core of the EMP is the online hub/portal system. This system will provide a user-friendly online mentoring platform, that enables the process of matching, interacting, and managing the mentoring activities. More importantly, this online hub will be a one-stop information source that provides crucial resources, which are related to employment services. It includes various employment service information including webinars, workshops, bridging programs, and internship programs organized by settlement service providers in the GTA. In addition, this online hub will provide virtual communities that stakeholders can actively engage in for networking purposes. Incorporating mobile applications and social networking services (SNS) will increase the networking and efficiency of service provision. This program will allow clients to actively find the right employment programs through real-time networking and assistance of a mentor and facilitator. Facilitators can easily monitor the status of each client and efficiently intervene in the mentoring activities as the online program will inform the progress of each mentee and provide necessary input to the facilitator. Particularly, the facilitator plays a critical role in the EMP as she/he becomes involved in the recruitment of participants (mentors, mentees, and supporting volunteers) to managing interactions between participants, and events. Also, the facilitator would actively be engaged in networking with service providers and ethnic institutions to gain the support from the partners.

43

The epic strength of this program is the utilization of Korean mentors who have successfully integrated into the Canadian labour market. The EMP will provide skilled Korean immigrants with an opportunity to connect with Korean leaders in their field. As role models, the Korean mentors will be able to provide inspiration and information and empower mentees so that they can strive to reach out to mainstream Canadian society. In addition to the technical aspect, the EMP requires a great deal of contribution from volunteers. Typically, volunteers become involved in trivial jobs that often fails to motivate them. However, in this program, volunteers play a vital role in searching for available employment services, programs, and networking events. Also, they can help mentors and mentees find customized information or resources. Another critical factor for the success of the EMP lies in the active collaboration and information sharing with other settlement service providers. Considering that KCWA provides limited services due to the capacity of the organization, it is crucial to have support from other service providers. For example, specialized Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) curriculum for skilled Korean immigrants can be discussed with JVS Toronto. Likewise, the bridging program and Enhanced Language Training (ELT) specialized for skilled Korean immigrants would be a possibility with JVS Toronto or ACCES employment. Furthermore, training and networking opportunities for Korean mentors and mentees besides establishing mentoring relationships can be discussed with TRIEC. Lastly, when it comes to collaboration, not only can it be with other service providers, but it can also be with ethnic institutions such as the Korean Consulate General, online/offline ethnic media, religious institutions, Korean businesses, and ethnic associations that can become crucial

44

components in the program. These ethnic institutions can participate in promoting the program, recruiting the mentors and volunteers, as well as raising funds for the program. In sum, the EMP seeks to provide the initial stage of a bridge to connect skilled Korean immigrants to the Canadian labour market by leveraging online tools and close collaboration of stakeholders. 5.2. Grant proposal This grant proposal was prepared based on OTF's Seed grant proposal guidelines with minor modification. 1. Brief backgrounder on your organization's typical activities, services, or programs (max.500 words) KCWA is a non-profit settlement service organization that was founded in 1985. Our primary service aims to provide a one-stop settlement service for ethnic Koreans in a manner that is culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate. In this capacity, clients receive timely services in their own languages without the need for interpretation to receive settlement services from reception to termination. On average, we deliver around 30,000 service encounters per year and in addition, offers numerous classes, workshops, and lectures on subjects like English-language training and job search techniques. For over 30 years, KCWA has played a vital role as it has worked to improve the quality of life of the Korean community in Ontario (Heritage Toronto, n.d.). We provide pre-arrival and settlement services at two of our offices in downtown Toronto and North York, and four itinerant locations including the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea's Toronto office and the offices of the Korean Canadian Cultural Association in Hamilton, London,

45

and Kitchener-Waterloo. Our services mainly cover employment services, family services, health services, settlement services, and social services. Specifically, our employment services provide one on one employment counseling which covers resume clinic, interview skill development, career training referrals, career networking club, employment workshops and job fair. Our family services include safety plan development for victims of domestic violence, transitional housing support, referrals to community services, legal information, educational workshops, and self-help groups. Health services include a mobile health clinic for cervical cancer screening, pap tests, screening for sexually transmitted infections, and breast cancer support group. Settlement services cover one-on-one orientation or information workshops, form filling, interpretation and translation, citizenship preparation, and referrals. Finally, our social services provide assistance in accessing social assistance and other services. Additionally, our social services cover recreational and educational programs to reduce social isolation. As one of the major projects, KCWA conducts the Bridge to Integration project which aims to achieve primary goals such as providing appropriate information and services to address settlement needs; enhancing awareness of community and other resources to deal with settlement issues; improving knowledge of life in Canada, including laws, rights, and responsibilities; and providing connections to communities and public institutions. In an effort to achieve our primary goals, we strive to empower newcomers to integrate into local labour markets, broader communities, and social networks, and furthermore, help them make informed decisions about life in Canada, enjoy rights and act on their responsibilities in Canadian society. Finally, we have maintained a successful relationship with IRCC by demonstrating the capacity to complete the delivery of IRCC funding programs

46

successfully. 2. Your organization's mission statement/principal mandate/overarching goal (max. 100 words) Mission statement: Building the Korean-Canadian community, one person at a time Vision: Barrier-free integration into Canada Core values:  Inclusiveness: We value individuals as they are and seek to create an inclusive environment for all  Excellence: We strive to provide high-quality services that effectively meet the needs of our clients  Integrity: We are committed to transparency, accountability, honesty, and professionalism in our actions  Respect: We promote the dignity of all persons, recognizing the inherent worth of each individual  Collaboration: We encourage teamwork and partnerships, both within KCWA and beyond 3. Your organization's impact on your community (max. 250 words) Since its inception in 1985, KCWA has been committed to the central role in settlement, social wellbeing and networking of the Korean ethnic community in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). It is known that Korea is the 9th largest source country in the Toronto CMA and there are more than 50,000 Korean people in this area (Statistics Canada, 2016). It has been discussed that the Korean ethnic group in Canada remains highly ethnically attached (Chan and Fong, 2012) and seeks help from the same ethnic community. In this context, KCWA, as the
47

only Korean ethno-specific settlement service provider in the Toronto CMA, has taken on the vital role for the Korean immigrant population to provide a diverse range of support that addresses various needs that arise during the settlement period. On average, we deliver around 30,000 service encounters per year, and also offer numerous classes, workshops, and lectures on subjects like English-language training, job search techniques, legal information, and Canadian life. The significance of KCWA is that we focus on providing community-centric, culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate services to ethnic Korean newcomers. All the staff at KCWA are bilingual, and we provide a safe space as a social and economic support for the ethnic Korean newcomer population from the same country. Moreover, we play a major role in connecting with particularly hard to reach newcomers living in areas with fewer community resources such as Hamilton, London, and Kitchener-Waterloo. These areas have the highest rate of Koreans newcomers beyond the GTA in Ontario.

4. Project Description: Provide a very brief description of your project The Enhanced Mentoring Program (EMP) is a multifaceted employment support program specialized for skilled Korean immigrants who are willing to enter into the Canadian labour market. Contrary to conventional mentoring programs organized by settlement service providers, the EMP employs online technology and structured collaboration with various stakeholders. 5. Is this a collaborative initiative? If yes, please provide details regarding the collaborators and planned nature of the collaboration (up to 125 words). The EMP is mainly based on collaboration with other service provider organizations (SPOs) in its nature. Due to the limited resources that KCWA has to offer, it is crucial for us to

48

identify and utilize diverse employment and settlement related services and programs as well as events that other SPOs already have. For example, JVS provides multiple services for immigrants such as LINC, ELT, employment workshop and the Bridging Program. Through the partnership with JVS, we will connect our mentees with applicable programs. TRIEC's resources and networking events are useful tools for training mentors and mentees. ACCES Employment has developed successful Bridging programs and employment resources, and they can be arranged for mentees. Those existing services and programs will be arranged through the online hub. 6. How much money are you requesting from OTF?: ($5,000 to $75,000) We are requesting $75,000 for this project. 7. Please select the population that is the primary focus of your grant. Select one: People with disabilities/ Francophones/ Aboriginal/ Diverse communities and racialized groups/ Women/ LGBTTQIA/ General populations: Racialized, Age, Size of the community Diverse communities and racialized groups 8. Please select the community size that is the primary focus of your grant. Select one: Rural or small communities (20,000 or less)/ Mid-size communities (20,001- 100,000)/ Urban centres and metropolitan suburbs (100,000+) Mid-size communities (20,001- 100,000) 9. Please select the age group primarily served by the grant. Select one: Children up to 12 years/ Youth/ Adults (25-64)/ Seniors (+65)/ General population (all age groups)

49

Adults (25-64) 10. Funding purpose: Funding for seed grants is for specific purposes. Will your project: (Select one): Research a new concept, idea or approach/ Develop, launch or test a new idea, approach or event/ Convene around an emerging issue/ Conduct a feasibility study/ Other ( If other, please explain (25 words max.)) Develop, launch or test a new idea, approach or event 11. Strategic alignment o Select the Action Area that most aligns with your project The Action Area of this program is `Connected People'- Building inclusive and engaged communities together o Select the grant result that most aligns with your project: (Select one from the table of priority outcomes and grant results) Diverse groups work better together to shape community o What is the idea, challenge or opportunity that your organization will explore in this project? (100 words max.) There are many employment service agencies who provide diverse employment programs for newcomers such as bridging program, ELT, Occupation Specific Language Training (OSLT), mentoring, and internship programs. However, many newcomers experience difficulty in getting access to the services due to lack of information, eligibility issues, or failure to get satisfactory results due to the inefficiency of the service. The EMP is designed to provide internet based integrated employment services on top of the conventional mentoring program. As a multifaceted employment support service, the EMP will provide online mentoring, virtual community, and accessible employment related resources and events.
50

o What is the need or opportunity in the community that this project will address? How pressing is the need or opportunity? How will you address that need or opportunity through the initiative? (200 words max.) (Please describe the community or population that the program is focused on. If appropriate, identify (ideally with numbers or percentages) any gaps in the community's well-being that this project will address. Describe how you identified the need or demand (focus groups, research, needs assessment, etc.). It is known that recent Korean immigrants who arrived after 1997 possess comparatively higher education levels compared to the overall Canadian population. However, the Korean ethnic group shows poor economic performance compared to other ethnic populations (Lindsay, 2007). Due to the language barrier and cultural differences, the majority of the Korean ethnic group remains in an ethnic bubble and does not easily integrate into the Canadian mainstream society. In addition, it is difficult for skilled Korean immigrants to be involved in existing employment programs designed for skilled immigrants due to the narrow scope of requirements. It demonstrates that there is a need for significant effort to motivate the successful integration of skilled Korean immigrants into the Canadian labour market. It has been claimed that social network and support from people of the same ethnic background are vital in helping immigrants deal with acculturation stress (Noh & Kaspar, 2005; Ye, 2006). Finally, the internet is considered a major information source for Korean immigrants during their settlement process. Therefore it is imperative to provide a bridge to connect the Korean ethnic community with mainstream society by offering ethno specific programing through means of technology.

(100 words max) (As appropriate, include what your organization, the community or sector expect to learn as a result of this project. Please outline next steps expected as a result of this Seed grant. (e.g., Specific new skills, new understandings or changes in attitudes on an issue, or changes to ways of working.); if it's proven successful or promising; this concept can be applied to other mentoring programs. Through the program, we strive to motivate skilled Korean immigrants so that they can attempt to enter the Canadian labour market. We anticipate learning the impact of the marriage of online hub system and the collaboration of stakeholders. The effectiveness of integration of mentoring service platform, resource centre, and networking space is to be examined. Furthermore, we expect to learn that the Enhanced Mentoring program can contribute to the betterment and overall quality of life for the Korean ethnic population in Canada. Therefore, the next step of the EMP will be the expansion of the scope beyond the employment service. 13. Process o Provide a brief description of the activities that you will perform to complete this project. (50 words max.) The EMP is comprised of six major components: an online hub system, a facilitator, mentors, mentees, volunteers, and partners. Major activities in this program
52

include the development of the online hub, recruitment, and training of Korean mentors who have established profession in Canada, and outreach to local partners and ethnic institutions. o Are there other organizations that are essential for the success of this project? If yes, please provide the names of these essential organizations. (25 words max.)     Employment programs: ACCES Employment Language programs: JVS Mentoring programs: TRIEC, Mentorcity Promotion partners (Ethnic institutions): The Korea Times, Mil Al Church

Chapter 6. Conclusion Canada's points-based immigration policy and Korean economic turmoil in the 1990s triggered the influx of Korean middle-class skilled workers. Comprised of mostly those from the economic class, the majority of Korean immigrants possessed superior human capital including a high level of education and professional experience compared to their predecessors. However, their limited official language proficiency and systemic barriers hampered them from integrating into the Canadian labour market and forced them to either find employment opportunities in the local Korean ethnic community or become self-employed. As a result, it is demonstrated that the Korean ethnic group shows a low level of economic outcomes even compared to other ethnic groups. Most Korean immigrants experience downward mobility and reside in an ethnic bubble. Furthermore, mainly low confidence in English communication and cultural differences have impeded the participation in multicultural settlement services. Even some of the existing employment programs including mentoring programs offered by SPOs are not approachable due to the limitation of eligibility. Therefore, it is evident that there should be customized employment services that are linguistically appropriate and culturally sensitive. Particularly, considering that Korean immigrants have been heavily influenced by other Korean immigrant cohorts, a customized employment service will change the lives of skilled immigrants if they were to have an opportunity to meet a role model who has become successfully established in his/her profession. In this paper, an alternative solution is suggested to address employment issues that prevent the integration of skilled Korean immigrants into the Canadian labour market. The EMP is presented in the form of a grant proposal. The EMP is a multifaceted employment support program, specialized for skilled Korean immigrants who are willing to enter into the Canadian
55

labour market. Contrary to conventional mentoring programs organized by SPOs, EMP employs online technology and structured collaboration with various stakeholders. Many Korean immigrants who are not engaged in the Canadian mainstream labour market do not feel a close attachment to Canadian society as argued by Omidvar& Richmond (2003). An ethnically customized and systemically integrated mentoring program will provide effective options to improve access to the Canadian labour market for the Korean ethnic community. It will open doors to allow for successful integration into Canadian society and to increase their overall sense of social inclusion (Omidvar& Richmond, 2003).
