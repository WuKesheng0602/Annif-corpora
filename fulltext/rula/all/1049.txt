Abstract

This thesis investigates a potential imaging method to provide high spatial resolution impedance information, known as Magneto-Acousto-Eiectrical Tomography (MAET). Both the forward and the inverse problems in MAET are explored by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The current density distribution that would exist in a sample if Andrew Hrbek a current were to be applied through the measurement electrodes or a coil is first mapped by applying the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism. Once the current distribution is known, it is possible to calculate the conductivity from this current density by solving a system of ordinary differential equations for the conductivity. These are obtained by applying the method of characteristics on the relevant Maxwell's equations involving the conductivity.

1.1 Electrical Impedance of Biological Tissue

While electrical parameters have long been measured for every possible substance known, the need to consider the electrical behaviour of complex substances can arise from the interest in how well any modality which depends on these parameters will perform. Unlike pure substances, biological tissue is very heterogeneous in structure, and one can expect the electrical behaviour, a property of the material, to also exhibit complex behaviour [1 ,2].

Biological tissue is organized into cells, which comprise 80░/o of the volume. Cells have a closed outer boundary, known as a membrane, which separates the extracellular fluid from the intracellular fluid. The extracellular fluid is the medium outside of the cell which contains mostly electrolytes and occupies the interstitial fluid between cells. The

intracellular fluid is the medium inside the cell and it contains the protoplasm that supports the organelles and the nucleus of the cell. As the intra- and extra- cellular fluids occupy the bulk of the biological tissue both within and between cells, it is the free ions in these fluids which then become the carriers of charge. For a fluid containing dissociated ions there will be charges contained in both

the cation (positive charge) and anions (negative charge). The ionic conductivity depends on the concentration, mobility, and degree of dissociation of the ions, as well as the temperature and viscosity of the fluid. For biological tissue, the most common

ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride.

Apart from the fluid phase, the other major influence in the conductivity of tissue is the cell membrane. It is a thin and elastic structure of proteins and lipids, 55o/o and 43░/o by composition respectively. The structure is that of the classic lipid bi-layer often shown in . texts on cell biology. The lipid molecules have a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, and in an aqueous environment the hydrophillic heads attract together and form two surfaces that orient towards both the intracellular fluids and extracellular fluids. In the region between these two surfaces are the hydrophobic ends of all the lipid molecules which bond together in a region devoid of water thus effectively separating the intracellular and extracellular fluids. The direct current conductivity of the membrane will be very poor as the ions, carriers of electrical current, cannot pass through the nonaqueous region contained in the lipid bilayer. This feature of the membrane is electrically equivalent to a capacitor. This is somewhat an oversimplified picture, as any living cell does need to pass substances through the membrane. To this end, various proteins are dispersed throughout the membrane to act as narrow channels to allow water and ions to pass through the membrane, effectively making the membrane more of a leaky capacitor. The cell membrane is an insulator, but it is also a dielectric as it is capable of being polarized by an external electric field. Although biological tissue is a very complex structure, a simple but effective model of biological tissue may be based upon the electrical behavior of the extracellular and intracellular fluids, as well as the cell membrane, using a conductance

a conductor when an electric field is applied. For biological tissue, the extracellular and intracellular fluids are the conductors,and the current density is due to the movement of ions. The permittivity is a measure of how much the electric field in the material is reduced from the free-space electric field. For insulators, the charges cannot move, but if the material is polar, then there will be charge distributions separated by some finite distance, called dipoles. An applied electric field will orient these dipoles so that they together generate an opposing field, and the net electric field in the insulator is then

The macroscopic description of the electrical properties of tissue is simplistic but it is far more practical to do than the microscopic view as the latter would be very complicated due to the extreme heterogeneity found in biological tissue. admittance Y = : The two possible extremes of electrical behaviours may now be treated by using a simple circuit model with the capacitance in parallel with a resistance.

instead vary with frequency of the applied signal. This frequency dependence of the material properties is called dispersion, and biological tissue exhibits several different types of dispersions over a wide frequency range. Since the model accounts for both moving and fixed charges, one can analyze these dispersions in terms of dipoles and charge carriers. At low frequencies, the dipoles can easily align themselves in response to the applied field and the charge carriers, the ions, have a significant field to travel relatively larger distances. For the charge carriers, it is also more likely that they may become trapped at an interface or defect because of the longer possible path. As a result of this trapping, further polarization is created and in effect the conductivity will be low and the permittivity is high. At higher frequencies, the dipoles have less time to respond to a changing field, so it is

The cell membrane will still prevent most ions from flowing through, but fewer ions will become trapped there because the shorter half-cycle of the alternating field prevents them from travelling far. As a result, there are fewer bound charges to create an opposing field to the applied field and the polarization is smaller, and the applied field is now stronger within the cell. Polarization of any constituent molecules such as proteins will still occur and contribute more to the overall permittivity. It is in this region that the capacitive reactance of the membrane now begins to decrease and effectively short the membrane resistance. The relative magnitudes of the two types of current, displacement and conduction, are best seen as a ratio of the two,

more difficult for them to oppose the field, so their polarization effect disappears. For the free ions that carry charge, the field may change before they travel an appreciable distance, so that the length of their path is now shorter for each shorter half-cycle of signal. With smaller distances travelled by the charge carriers, the likelihood that they will become trapped and contribute to the permittivity diminishes. Since the ions still are

very small compared to unity, (J

<< 1, even though the relative permittivity may high.

For frequencies up to the MHz range, biological tissue is primarily conductive, and treating it electrically like a real resistance is justified. Tissue is a very inhomogeneous structure, and because of this it is difficult to make consistent measurements of its electrical properties. At low frequencies, cells may be considered as insulators suspended in a conductive fluid, but at higher frequencies, such as the MHz range, the membrane reactance becomes lower so that the dispersion in the membrane and the interior of the cell must now be accounted for. Also, the tissue itself may contain several different kinds of cells, each with their own electrical properties, all together within an extracellular matrix which may also have its own electrical behaviour. Unlike a standardized sample of single and identical cells, living

able to move, the conductivity increases, as fewer of them become trapped. The dispersion that occurs at frequencies below 1OkHz is called a -dispersion, and it is a result of free ions becoming trapped at interfaces, or cell membranes, and creating significant polarization due to the trapping of ions of both charges. Any dipoles are able to readily orient themselves and thus create an opposing field to the signal which also

tissue will have even more complicated behaviour as it may be an integral component of several systems, such as the cardiovascular or nervous system. Some tissues also have anisotropic behaviour in that the dielectric and conductive quantities are dependent on direction. This occurs in muscle or bone, for example, in which the forces act predominantly in one direction, so the tissue is able to accommodate this anisotropy in its normal function. As a result, the conductivity along a cell in muscle fiber may be more than the conductivity of adjacent cells. The anisotropy of tissue will still be dependent on frequency, and especially so if the effect is due to cell membranes, which at higher frequencies will exhibit a lower reactance and a corresponding decrease in the direction dependence. The anisotropy is just one physiological trait of certain tissues that may be detected with a change in conductivity. Often another factor in the conductivity is the water content. Fat is a poor conductor in comparison to muscle, and any change in the relative compositions in these two substances will lead to a significant change in the conductivity. This would lead to the conclusion that the conductivity is dependent on the concentration of fluid in the material. On one side of the conductivity spectrum is blood, which is almost entirely liquid and very conductive, and on the other side is skin or fat which make relatively poor conductors. Skin in particular, is also very inhomogeneous, and it consists of three layers called the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue and its main purpose is to protect the body from the environment. Of these, it is the epidermis, which is the outermost layer and composed of dead cells, that poses the

reasoning may now be expanded to whether differences in the physiology of the same tissue may now be differentiated according to differences in impedance. Detecting these variations can determine the presence of a tumor, which is an abnormal growth of tissue surrounded by normal healthy tissues. It has no useful function and grows to the detriment of the normal biological environment around it. With a background of a known conductivity ranges for healthy tissue, a localized region of higher conductivity due to the cancer may be visible in an otherwise lower-conducting tissue, for example. A study by Smith on tumor liver tissue showed a considerable difference in the electrical properties between healthy and normal tissues. Tumor conductivity was found to be 67.5 times higher than that of the normal liver, and the permittivity was 2-5 times higher. For such an increase in conductivity, it is likely that the tumor will have a higher water content. The relative difference in the electrical properties between tissue and tumor will depend on the type of tissue as well as the stage of the tumor itself, as both factors will influence the amounts and distributions of biological conductors and insulators, so it may not be possible to generalize these results. Even so, there has been considerable work done so far to develop devices that may be used to determine the electrical conductivity of biological tissue so that this phenomenon may be better understood and detected.

greatest resistance making it a very effective insulator near DC especially when dry. One item of great interest is the possibility of using impedance measurements for the non-invasive measurements of the physiological changes and differences in tissues. Given that there are many different tissues each with their own structures and electrical properties, one can imagine that impedance measurements would be able to reconstruct these differences and offer a view of these relative variations.

1.2 Electrical Impedance Imaging

A later imaging modality, known as MREIT [3] (magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography), was designed to overcome the ill-posed ness in the reconstruction that plagued EIT. It makes use of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in

Any electrical impedance imaging device will apply some current or voltage to the object of interest. The electrical properties, being the conductivity and the permittivity are then inferred from measurements of the electromagnetic quantities elsewhere in the material which are the response to the applied field. In principle, this method of imaging is safe and makes use of easily available technology, so it is no surprise that it is the subject of considerable research interest for clinical application. The established and documented techniques in impedance measurement to date are electrical impedance tomography (EIT), magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT), and magnetic induction tomography (MIT). Historically, the first impedance images were done using EIT (electrical impedance tomography). (see appendix A for a full account). Typically, sixteen electrodes are placed about the circumference of a patient for Sheffield systems, the standard model for this device. For each set of measurements, current is injected in any two adjacent electrodes while voltage measurements are taken from the remaining fourteen. Then the current source is shifted to the next pair of electrodes with which the voltages are collected from the remaining electrodes, and the cycle continues until all adjacent pairs of electrodes have been used as a current source. The conductivity is obtained from the transfer impedance derived from these voltage measurements for a given current configuration. The major drawback to this method is known as the ill-posed ness of the inverse problem. The finite sets of measurements, which are confined to the boundary of the test subject, severely limit the spatial resolution possible. There are other problems including errors in the placement of electrodes, as well as the insensitivity of the electrode voltages to a change in conductivity deep in the interior of the object.

conjunction with a injected currents. These currents will produce an induced magnetic flux within the object which is synchronized with the MR imaging pulse sequence. If two currents in two different directions are injected in sequence, then by using the magnetic flux densities, a cross-sectional image of conductivity distribution may be obtained. A high spatial resolution may be obtained in this image using an additional boundary voltage measurement. One major disadvantage to this technique is the high costs associated with the MRI, as well as the shielding effect from the electrodes. Unlike the previous two techniques, MIT [4] does not require any direct physical contact of the sensors to the object that is to be imaged. Instead, a magnetic field is applied from one or more generator coils to induce eddy currents in the study object, so that the region of interest is penetrated with an oscillating magnetic field. The primary field generated by the exciting coil as well as the secondary field created by the induced eddy currents are then detected by another set of coils known as receiving coils. The manner in which the measurements are taken is similar to EIT. For example, if there are n measurement coils and m excitation coils per layer, forming a ring, then the total number of measurements possible is m(n-1) if every coil about the circumference is an excitation coil once. Unlike EIT, MIT can also measure the permeability of the material in addition to the conductivity. The measurements are performed in a manner similar to EIT with its electrodes now replaced by exciting and receiving coils, and the inverse problem is also nonlinear and ill-posed. The resulting conductivity image from this technique also has a poor resolution.

inverse problem (are the signals or measurements sufficient to reconstruct the conductivity). The current investigation of the feasibility of MAET has two components: experiment and theory. This thesis investigates the theoretical aspects of MAET and

Given the present state of devices intended for imaging electrical properties and their capabilities, there is still no commercial device capable of producing high-resolution images of the conductivity. Continuing research may hopefully develop one that will find use in the future. One potential imaging method for current density and electrical impedance is known as MAET (Magneto-Acousto-Eiectro-Tomography),[5,6] and it relies on the action of ultrasound in a static magnetic field to image the electrical properties of tissue. This idea has already been reported in the literature by other authors, notably by Han Wen [7], although in his paper it was referred to as Hall Effect Imaging. An ultrasonic pulse is transmitted into a sample in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. Charged particles in the medium are displaced by the acoustic vibration, and since they are moving in a magnetic field, experience the Lorentz force. As the material is itself neutral because it is composed of equal numbers of positive and negative charges, then these charges are separated and a voltage signal is produced on the surface of the sample. As the ultrasound wave propagates through the sample, the time-varying voltage signal represents the degree to which the charges separate along the signal path. Unlike EIT, in which the signal source is confined to the surface of the sample, the sound beam may be swept throughout the sample. Provided that the magnetic field is always

compares its predictions to the experimental findings when possible. This thesis also investigates the inverse problem of the modality, which is an important part of its feasibility.

Hypothesis in MAET

The hypothesis behind MAET is essentially two-fold, both of which are addressed in the thesis: The first hypothesis is that the lead field current density or the coil field current density may be mapped pointwise, at least to a good approximation in a volume conductor. The validation of this hypothesis is largely experimental, but there are some theoretical considerations also, owing to the application of the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism in experimental work and its justification of the simulations to which the experimental results were compared. The first hypothesis is the motivation behind the forward problem. The second hypothesis, which is the feasibility of obtaining the conductivity once the lead or coil field current density is known, will be addressed in more detail when the inverse problem is introduced.

present, this source of EMF has been compared to a moving battery. As an ultrasound is being used to ultimately drive an electrical signal at the output, it is assumed that the resolution similar to that from ultrasound may be obtained in MAET. Although Wen's paper [7], upon which MAET is based, promises two or three dimensional conductivity images with Hall Effect Imaging there is only a brief derivation of the forward problem (the physics needed to get a signal) and no mention of the

2.1.1 Lorentz Force

Since it is the path of least time that is being solved for, the function q is varied only within the interval, and it is fixed at either endpoint,

&j lbdy == 0.

Now

MAET depends on the Lorentz force acting upon moving ions to generate a signal. It is the critical component in this modality. Its importance merits this section, devoted to the derivation of the Lorentz force and its consequences.

The Lorentz force acts on moving charges, and the velocity is assumed uniform, which is not strictly the case with MAET since the oscillatory velocity is alternating direction by accelerating. However, if the charge separation has a smaller timescale than the change in velocity, then a uniform velocity during the charge separation is justified. If the force on a charge is force

Any accumulated electrostatic charge that contributes to the gradient of the scalar potential always be modified by the impressed field.

dimensions of a realistic ultrasound focus as well as any effects of its wave nature on the induced electric field. A direct simulation reveals more details, although such an approach is also computationally time-consuming. This variational approach used to derive the Lorentz force is open to at least two extensions. In this case, the trajectory of a single charged particle was only considered, but in a real fluid there will be an immense number of them. Also, the issue of conductivity was not addressed, but its effects may be included as a term in the Lagrangian which decreases the kinetic energy of the particle and is both position and velocity dependent. As the conductivity increases, less kinetic energy is lost to friction, and as the conductivity decreases more kinetic energy is lost. The Lorentz force would then include a damping term representing this friction, which is inversely related to the conductivity. Once the damping factor to the Lorentz force is included, the next step

would be to find the Hamiltonian from the Lagrangian by using a Legendre transform, and then extending this Hamiltonian to an ensemble of particles. This approach, not yet attempted, will lead to a statistical mechanics interpretation of the conductivity for dissociated ions, and for now it remains only a possible avenue in further work.

2.1:2 Poynting's Theorem

The two previous equations may be added: Poynting's Theorem will be derived in this section. It is a statement of the conservation of energy of an electromagnetic field in the form of a continuity equation [13]. Its derivation is also the basis of how the reciprocity theorem is derived from Maxwell's equations. The only difference between the two theorems is that Poynting's theorem involves one field, whereas the reciprocity theorem involves two independent fields. The energy in an electromagnetic field is a critical point in the analysis of the forward problem in MAET, because the reciprocity theorem in electromagnetism allows a simpler forward model with fewer computational demands at the expense of neglecting the wave properties of ultrasound. The derivation of Poynting's theorem begins with Faraday's law and Ampere's law. The identity:

E. atjj + fi. atf3 =E. (v X fi )- fi. (v xБ)- J. E
The left hand side may be grouped as a single time derivative:

_l_a 1 (cE иE + flliи ii)= E и (Vxii)- ii и(Vxi)-J. E.
2

E. (vxfi)-fi. (vxБ)= -V. (ffxfi)
may be substituted into the previous equation, to get Poynting's theorem:

Vx E = -a 1 B (Faraday's Law)
V X fi = J +a 1 D (Ampere's Law)
The vector Ex H is the Poynting vector, which is a flux of energy into (or out of) a Together with the relations for the material:

The inner product of Ampere's Law may be taken with E:

2.1.3 The Reciprocity Theorem

Poynting's theorem leads to a continuity equation of the energy of the electromagnetic field, and the flux vector Ex fi is known as the Poynting vector. So far, all that has been considered is the energy as an inner product of two electric field vectors These two equations may then be added together to form.

E and
Using the constitutive relations Ba = JlaH a and Db = БbEb on the left hand side of the previous equation leads to:

two magnetic field vectors H both from the same field . This concept of energy may now be generalized into inner products for two independent fields Ea fi a ,and Eb fibto what is known as the reciprocity theorem [16]. Consider Faraday's Law for field a and Ampere's Law for field b:

Assuming a single frequency of oscillation for each field using the frequency domain eliminates the derivatives with respect to time leads to:

With two fields, there are now four possible sets of constitutive relations defined for each field.

j(J)af1aiib . ii a + j(J)bБbEa . Eb = Ea . (v xiib )-fib . (v X Ea )- ] b . Ea.
The right hand side may be simplified by the identity:

This simplification leads to:

ill .,,

The left hand side may be simplified by assuming a common frequency of oscillation OJ to each field, using OJa = OJb =OJ leads to: The inner product of Faraday's Law for field a may be taken with fib, and the inner product of Ampere's Law for field b may be taken with

Ea:

24

25

For both fields, the material properties are the same,

fla = flb = /1

and

Бa = Бb = Б,

because the independent fields exist in the same material in question:

fJb.E;a -]a иEbdV=O.
n
In reciprocity, the field quantities which are actually used in the above integral are referred to as impressed fields, otherwise known as non-conservative fields which are

}m(pHb и Ha +ББa и Eb) = -V и (Ea X fib)- Jb и Ea и
Another equation may easily be obtained by interchanging the a and b indices, since Ampere's Law could have been used for field a and Faraday's Law could have been used for field b :

not the result of charges, but they serve to alter the distribution of charges. Recalling the expression for the total electric field derived from the Lorentz force:

E;' =-Vб+(vxli)
The conservative term is Subtraction of the last two equations leads to

Vб, and the non-conservative, or impressed term, is

(v x B). Being an inner product between an electric field and a current density, the
physical quantity present in the reciprocity theorem is that of power dissipation, which implies a flow of current. A steady current may only be produced in the presence of non-

conservative fields, so their use is justified. Having arrived the final form of the reciprocity theorem in electromagnetism, it is now possible to examine the forward problem of MAET, which is the current density produced with a known conductivity.

Ja = aaEa

and

Jb = abEb:

Vи (E aX Hb)- Vи (E bX Ha)+ (jbEbи Ea- (jaEaи Eb = 0 и
Since the material is the same for both fields, for consistency both conductivities must be the same a a = ab =a. The reciprocity becomes:

V и(E a X Hb)- Vи (EbX Ha ) = 0 ,
111 .,

and

The last expression may be integrated over the entire domain of the material:

In reality, these leads are used lated to the current density J 1ead .

The COMSOL simulations of J 1ead in Figures 1 and 2 were compared to experimental measurements of the lead field current density obtained from the actual MAET setup.

In practice, Poisson's equation is best solved using COMSOL, a finite element method software package, which is ideal for solving partial differential equations. It is a very versatile tool for visualizing solutions of a wide range of these equations with modest hardware and software requirements. It is also user-friendly, and indeed all of the work done in COMSOL for this thesis was done using its graphical user interface.

The electrodes in this model are assumed to have a point sized region of contact which maintains a constant charge density, and these source terms to the divergence may be represented in COMSOL as the weak form.

Figure 1. Lead field current density in a phantom-shaped domain represented as streamlines. The point of contact of the electrodes is represented as a point source at either end of the domain. The intensity of the horizontal component of the current density peaks within the channel. The experimentally determined current density may be compared to this model.

The models from COMSOL, also have another use, which is to test the inverse problem of finding the conductivity from the lead field current density. This will be addressed in the latter part of the thesis. The experimental determination of the lead field current density was done by Syed Haider in his thesis [24]. Phantoms with uniform conductivity were used in the actual MAET setup, and the results were compared with these simulations.

2.2.1.2 Discussion

The evaluation of the rightmost integral cannot proceed any further unless more is known about Acoil, which is the vector potential generated by a current flowing through a coil. This requires a temporary detour from this application of the reciprocity theorem. A general analysis of the vector potential begins with Ampere's law, simplified for a negligible displacement vector D . This is consistent with the lead field current density discussed earlier, because the frequency range of MAET excludes significant permittivity contributions and magnetic fields may be considered to be magnetostatic: with the solution:

3.1 Theory

Until now, the forward problem has been developed extensively in which a known conductivity allows a current density to be calculated. Now it is time to explore the inverse problem, which is to determine the conductivity from the current density. The relations between these two quantities involve the first derivatives of the conductivity in the form of first order partial differential equations. Provided that first derivatives exist, every first order partial differential equation has a solution. Recalling the hypothesis for MAET: и In the forward problem, the lead field or coil field current density may be mapped in a volume conductor. и In the inverse problem, the conductivity may be obtained from the lead field or coil field current density

3.1.1 The Method of Characteristics

The surface S

= {x,y,u(x,y)}

is constructed by a union of curves

r =: {x(s),y(s),u(s)}
The method of characteristics [17] offers a way to solve for the conductivity by converting partial differential equations to an equivalent system of ordinary differential equations. It is a general technique that may be applied to any first-order partial differential equation in any number of variables, although the following work involves mainly two independent variables. Given the linear equation: between the normal to

tangent vector is defined as (x(s),j;(s), u(s)),

where ( x s , y s , u s

. ( ) . ( ) . ( )) = _ (dx(s) , dy(s) , du(s)) , ds ds ds au ax au ay

and it is also perpendicular to the normal (-(x,y),-(x,y),-1). The inner product

.

S and the tangent to

r

is also zero:

au . au a(x,y)-(x,y) + b(x,y)-(x,y) == c(x,y), ax ay
the solution is the surface S

(au (x, y), au (x,y),-1). (.X(s), y(s),u(s)) = au x(s) +au y(s)- u(s) = 0.
~ ~ ~ ~

= {x,y,u(x,y)}.
The tangent vector to

S must be equal to the tangent vector of r, as the vector field

To find this solution it is first useful to express the partial differential equation as an inner product:

(a(x(s),y(s)),b(x(s),y(s)),c(x(s),y(s))) is also tangent tor. (a(x(s ), y(s)),b(x(s ), y(s)), c(x(s ), y(s ))) = (x(s ), y(s ), u(s)).

au au (a(x,y),b(x, y),c(x,y)) и (-(x, y),-(x, y),-1) = 0. ax ay
This inner product suggests that the vector (a(x,y),b(x,y),c(x,y)) is perpendicular .

The curves r

= {x(s),y(s),u(s)}

are the solutions of the system of equations, known

as characteristic equations:

au au au ' to(-a (x,y),-(x,y),-1). The vector (-(x,y),-(x,y),-1) is the normal to S, so X ay ax ay
at each point {x,y,u(x,y)} the vector (a(x,y),b(x,y),c(x,y)) must lie in the tangent plane of S.

which is the solution to the POE.

3.1.2 The Conductivity as the 'Energy'

3.1.3 Liouville's theorem

The forward problem was initially an electrodynamics problem, but the inverse is analogous to a mechanical problem, as it now involves trajectories. Given that

Now that the method of characteristics has provided both a phase space and a Lyapunov function, Liouville's theorem may be applied to find the density of trajectories in phase space. It is a statement of particle conservation in which a large number of trajectories in the phase space are compared to that of a fluid [20]. Let p be the density of particles in a volume V of phase space. The number of particles in the volume of phase space is:

x = a(x(s),y(s)) and y = b(x(s),y(s)) provide the coordinates of the phase space,
one quantity that is highly pursued in the solution of systems of ordinary differential equations is the energy, although this name is used in a different context from the more familiar physical energy. It is more formally called the Lyapunov function to prevent confusion, and normally there is no way to find it except by trial and error. If the Lyapunov function is defined as H, its derivative is defined as [see 18,19,21]

(it is easier to go downhill than it is to

go uphill). Using the method of characteristics automatically provides

H in the form of

u(x,y).
In systems of ordinary differential equations obtained by solving for the conductivity using the method of characteristics, the Lyapunov function will be the conductivity since

Since each particle can be associated with one trajectory, then the density of particles is identical to the density of trajectories.

3.2 Methods

The method of characteristics along with Liouville's theorem have been introduced as a tool for solving first order partial differential equations. They may now be applied to any partial differential equation involving the conductivity and current density, with the goal of solving for the conductivity for a given current density. The two partial differential equations considered will be both Poisson's equation (the divergence of the current density), and Faraday's law.

The result of using the method of characteristics to determine the conductivity from the current density in Poisson's equation is that the conductivity will be an indeterminate constant.

Once these current densities are known, they may then be used to for the system of ODE's. Unlike the characteristic equations for Poisson's equation, the trajectories are perpendicular to the current density, and the conductivity is obtained along these curves. As the streamlines of the current density form closed loops, there will be a single point in the domain where all of these trajectories intersect. This is called the

The initial conditions are { x(O) , y (O) , a(O)} at s == 0 as the system is an initial value problem. There is no rule for finding the initial conductivity at the fixed point, but once the fixed point is known, even an erroneous initial conductivity will quickly converge to the correct conductivity along the trajectory.

Figure 9. With modifications, the trajectories are constrained to straight lines in (x,y) space originating from the fixed point, which is visible in this plot as a central disk. The time required for a reconstruction with a modified phase space is no different from the unmodified one. The time required to complete 400 trajectories with MATLAB is about 20 minutes on a standard desktop computer. These trajectories are then interpolated together to form the image in Figure 10.
The inverse does not necessarily need to be confined to a thin slab domain. Domains with geometries resembling those of the actual phantom used in experiments may be used to test the performance of the inverse. An example is included in Figure 11, the forward problem, and Figure 12, the inverse problem. The coil field current density may be obtained from the solution of the for-Ward problem with COMSOL. The coil field current density may then be used in the system of ordinary differential equations, which lends itself to a solution in MATLAB.

The method of characteristics applied to Faraday's Law has proven, at least in principle, to provide a reliable reconstruction of the conductivity for the coil field current density. In spite of its ability to reproduce distinct constant conductivities, the unaltered method is inherently unstable. The instability can, however, be remedied by modifying the phase space so that trajectories originating from the fixed point are constrained to propagate along straight lines in a direction away from the fixed point. This modification increases the stability because the trajectories cannot diverge as a result of a conductivity increase. Even so, the trajectories still diverge away from the coil axis and resolution can be expected to diminish away from the coil axis. The utility of solving Faraday's law with the method of characteristics may also be applied to solving for the conductivity from the lead field current density. and for a conductivity a

The inverse for the coil field forward problem can now be slightly modified to find the conductivity from the forward problem of the lead field.

trajectories are nowhere tangent to each other. Although any streamline tangent to the current density will be sufficient for generating initial points, it is a straight line joining the two electrodes as a generator for initial conditions that is often convenient. The reason for this is mainly due to the geometry of the phantom involved. It is symmetrical about such a line, and the domain tends to narrow abruptly near the centre into a channel. In this case, the current density about this channel will predominantly contain a component parallel to a straight-line joining the two electrodes. With such a line of initial conditions, the domain may be split into two halves, each containing trajectories that move away from the initial points on the line . It is also worth considering Liouville's theorem for stability. Using the equations:

regions of higher conductivity, but not to the extent as the trajectories in the coil, since the continuity equation lacks the forcing term aB z . The advantage with better stability is that in practice, there are no modifications needed as those used for the coil.

3.2.3.1 Results
It has been found that the initial conditions all lie on a streamline, and this curve divides the domain into two regions. Trajectories beginning at initial conditions along the streamline will traverse only one of the regions with the characteristic equations so far. The current density due to the lead field has a very different geometry from the coil and a plot of the phase space trajectories now contains separatrices, boundaries which separate two trajectories with very different long-term behaviours, shown in Figure 13. There is no longer a single fixed point and individual trajectories do not intersect each other anywhere throughout the domain.

Figure 14. Happyface conductivity distribution. The domain is mostly filled with a region of constant conductivity, and it is possible to find a streamline which traverses only this region. This may be used for initial conditions to find the conductivity in Figure 15. This COMSOL forward model will generate current densities which are then used to generate the trajectories in the reconstruction.

Figure 15. Reconstructed happyface conductivity using the background conductivity. The time needed to complete 400 trajectories is comparable to the coil, about 30 minutes.
Another solution to uncertain initial conductivities uses the observation that the calculated conductivity eventually converges to the real conductivity after a longer trajectory time. The remedy for the lack of initial conductivities is to sample the neighbourhood of the initial line to determine whether the conductivity changes along the trajectories. This is done by solving the characteristic equations for very short trajectories for each initial condition and then updating the initial conductivity once each

82
83

integration has terminated, with the conductivity at the end of the trajectory. There is no limit on how many times the initial conductivity may be updated, except computational time. The initial conductivity will slightly improve with each update, but the updated conductivities may also converge to very unrealistically small values. While the idea behind making repetitive updates is to make the initial conductivity converge to the correct form, each update must be multiplied by a scaling factor to ensure that the new maximum is the same as the maximum of the pre-updated conductivity. By doing successive updates over short trajectories near the initial conditions, the intent is to create an overall longer path composed of many short trajectories. Also, conductivity updates along these short trajectories will take into account the local distribution of conductivity near the initial conductivity.

The only option at present is to begin at the line of symmetry in the horizontal axis in Figure 17. The initial conductivity along this line will be a constant due to the lack of knowledge of the actual initial conditions along the initial conditions. An example is provided in Figure 16 in which the conductivity changes everywhere. There is no longer any streamline which traverses a region of constant conductivity and conductivity distribution along any streamline cannot be inferred otherwise.

3.2.3.2 Discussion

Chapter 4. Discussion and Future Work
In closing, the reconstruction of the conductivity may be achieved for the lead field current density in addition to the coil field current density. Its properties, when applied to the lead field, differ greatly from those of the coil field. The geometry of the lead field current density changes the initial conditions from the fixed point seen in the coil field to a streamline of the current density. In particular, the conductivity along the streamline of current density can be indeterminate unless it is known background conductivity. The reconstruction involving the lead field current density is, however, more stable to increases in conductivity than its coil field equivalent. With stability also comes improved resolution, because the characteristic curves do not diverge so easily. The application of the method of characteristics to the solution of Maxwell's equations for the conductivity has been proven to provide reasonable reconstructions from either the lead field current density or the coil field current density, with few caveats. The method has not been tried on current densities obtained from experimental data, which may have unexpected effects on its ability to obtain the conductivity. There is also room for improvement in the handling of noise in the current density. Given all of the uncertainties of its further use, it is helpful to know the important aspects of the theory behind the method of characteristics, so that improvements may be carefully applied. This theory has been presented throughout this thesis as needed. In future work there are several avenues to the improvement and extension of this method.

4.1 Initial Conditions of the Conductivity

The initial conditions of the conductivity have not yet been addressed entirely. For the coil method, they are not as major an impediment as they are for the reconstruction with the lead field. The conductivity was already found to correspond to the 'energy' function of the phase space created by the method of characteristics when applied to first order partial differential equations involving the current density and the conductivity. This 'energy', not necessarily the physical energy, is often referred to as the Lyapunov function, and it is typically found by trial and error. In a physical system it may be the Hamiltonian from which the equations of motion are derived. Any ongoing research in differential equations is likely to include newer analytical techniques that may help to

Perhaps such a technique may aid the lead field reconstruction by providing at least an initial estimate of the conductivity distribution along the line of initial conditions. Finding initial conductivities more effectively will also serve in realizing three dimensional images of the conductivity.

Typically 400 trajectories are needed for a reasonable resolution in the inverse with a run-time on the order of a half hour. With noise, the time to complete this number of trajectories will be on the order of a day. Possible remedies in the near future may be to apply filtering to the noisy data to exclude high frequency oscillations, or to include regularization [25] in the reconstruction to exclude a rapidly varying conductivity along the trajectories.

The profile of the ultrasound cross-section has been assumed to be a delta function so that we can obtain an ideal distribution of current density point-wise. In experiments, the resolution of the current density distribution is limited by the beam diameter of the ultrasound wave. Consequently, the resolution of the reconstructed electrical conductivity cannot have a better resolution than the ultrasound beam diameter even in an ideal reconstruction case (see Appendix 8.3 for focused ultrasound). In addition, noise in the experimental data will deteriorate the image resolution further due to the cut-off of the high frequency component of the signal.

a thin (compared with the ultrasound wavelength) sample due to the oscillatory nature of ultrasound waves. Therefore, two dimensional image reconstruction was concentrated upon in this thesis. The method to measure the current density in the interior of a thick sample is being investigated, and the question of three dimensional images will be addressed. Recall that Faraday's law originally had three components, although only the third was used. Four sets of phase spaces will require four parameters (s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 ) .The coordinates which these parameters will determine are:

(x, y, z, o-) == (x (s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 ), y (s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 ), z (s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 ), o- (s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 ) ) , since
the conductivity is now also a coordinate. With four phase spaces, there is every possibility that the transformation (s 1 ,s 2 ,s 3 ,s 4 ) ---7 (x,y,z,a) will determine unique conductivities. The Jacobian for this transformation is:

space will be orthogonal to each of the three other equations, even if they are not orthogonal to each other. It may be possible to use Poisson's equation trajectories as initial conditions for the three curl equations to find the conductivities in the yz, xz, and xy planes throughout the three dimensional domain. The question of initial conductivities will also be important here. All of these data will be four dimensional points, but MATLAB is very capable of interpolating such points. Hopefully this will lead to the three dimensional images of conductivity alluded to in Wen's paper [7].

The method of characteristics applied to partial differential equations of the conductivity resulting from Maxwell's equations has been able to provide conductivity images for at least two configurations in current density, the lead field and the coil field.

There is much work that needs to be done in this area, and nothing has been tried, but there is one possible route that may be attempted.

Appendices

Appendix A: Electrical Impedance Tomography

The background to electrical impedance tomography is presented here for comparison The inherent resolution is still limited by diverging trajectories, but not to the extent seen in the coil. The initial conditions lie along a streamline of current density, and the resulting trajectories can fill the phantom more uniformly. The overall resolution is better than that for the coil. Aside from the different configurations and their reconstruction properties, use of the method of characteristics is based on the assumption that the current density and the conductivity are both continuous functions of position with continuous first derivatives. It is anticipated that even in the presence of noise, real current densities with real conductivities will indeed have these properties even with noise and smoothing of the data. Although real conductivities may change over short distances, a sudden jump, such as a Heaviside step function is unlikely. Electrical impedance tomography is an imaging modality that makes use of an applied This system of reconstruction is relatively new, but given these considerations, it should be pursued further, especially now that its basic properties are known. electrical current to probe the inside structure of a body. The method is sensitive to electrical conductivity since a known current is injected into the body and the resulting electrical potential is then measured at regular points along the boundary. It is possible to then reconstruct these voltage measurements in such a way as to obtain a picture of the conductivity distribution within the body. Since alternating currents can be used, it is also possible to measure the impedance, although it is the conductivity (real resistance) that is more often done. to MAET. Like MAET, EIT is a device intended to measure the conductivity in a volume conductor, and its analysis consists of both a forward and inverse problem. Unlike MAET, it is already in widespread use, although its resolution is poor due to the illposedness of the inverse problem. Due to the similarities between MAET and EIT, the inverse for EIT was also considered as a possible method of reconstruction in MAET, although a more appropriate technique was found.

A.1 Introduction

A.2 Sheffield systems

Sheffield systems need multiplexers to switch current to adjacent electrode pairs and this switching will introduce extra shunt capacitance on the electrodes. As a result, only the real (resistive) component of the voltage is used while the reactive component is

The most common EIT systems are the 16 electrode systems with a single current source from Sheffield. There are three versions : the mark 1, mark 2, both of which are single frequency, and the multifrequency mark 3. The mark 1 supplies current at 50kHz at 1 rnA, and the potentials are measured from the remaining electrodes. The mark 2 operates with a 5 rnA sinusoidal current source at a frequency of 20.83kHz, which is generated using a DAC that reads a ROM lookup table as it is very difficult to generate stable sine waveforms otherwise. Using any other waveform will lead to corrupted signals as only certain harmonics would be corrupted by the complex impedance ,of biological tissue. The current source is coupled via a transformer primarily for safety reasons to allow the subject to float with ground potential so as to prevent electric shock. A current sensing resistor is then placed in series with the subject to monitor current. Differential voltages are then measured between adjacent electrodes using AC coupled instrumentation amplifiers. These instrumentation amplifiers are then
I

ignored, omitting any impedance reconstruction. For any object with cylindrical symmetry, there are normally 16 electrodes evenly distributed about the circumference per layer. This measurement strategy is called the Sheffield measurement protocol and adjacent electrodes between layers are used to apply current while voltages are measured along the remaining electrodes about the circumference except for those electrodes closest to the current sources. For 16 electrodes there will be 16 measurement patterns each with 13 voltage measurements along the circumference for a total of 208 per layer. Of the 208 measurements, only 104 are non-redundant due to reciprocity.

transformer coupled to OTA's or variable gain amplifiers. These OTA's (operational transconductance amplifiers) usually operate as matched transistor pairs so AC coupling will allow proper biasing of the transistor bases. Since instrumentation amplifiers are used, it is important that they have a high CMRR. Ideally, if the two inputs are tied to the same voltage then the output of such an amplifier should be zero. Any mismatch between input impedances will inadvertently cause a differential input voltage and nonzero amplified output. Problems with CMRR worsen with increasing frequency, but they may be compensated for by adding an extra current source far away from the electrodes so as to create an extra voltage and reduce the common mode seen by all amplifiers. For such compensation the gain must be kept relatively low so that unwanted oscillations do not occur. The divergence of Ampere's Law is: For a single frequency

A.5 Optimization and reconstruction

Although it is desirable from an optimization point of view to have many slack variables, the main disadvantage lies with experimental error and noise. Any error in the measured voltage could likely result in a suboptimal determination of all conductivities.

With the Jacobian, if there are as many conductivity regions as there are measurements then by finding the inverse of the Jacobian one should be able to use these measurements to find the distribution of conductivities. 208 total measurements can only determine 104 conductivities in 104 subdivisions of a cylindrical cross-section uniquely due to reciprocity. Unfortunately, this is poor resolution, as this is far greater than the millimeter resolution for ultrasound for anatomy-sized dimensions. One might wish to increase the resolution by introducing more conductivity regions for the same domain, for example to 256 or 512. In that case, the Jacobian is no longer a square matrix but a rectangular one. The excess conductivities introduce slack into the corresponding voltages so that the transformation from voltages to conductivities is no longer unique and matrix inversion is no longer straighforward. In this case we must consider some way to 'guess' at the conductivity so that its corresponding voltages match the observed voltages as closely as possible.
II
I

One way to invert the matrix J dm,k == J is to use singular value decomposition. As the Jacobian is non-square then there will be two possible ranks determined by the number of conductivities and voltage measurements. This leads to two metrics J HJ and JJ H both of which are positive definite square matrices but differ in rank. The superscript H denotes the Hermitian transpose where the conjugate of complex entries is taken.

at the discontinuity and zero value elsewhere. The use of a Jacobian is based on the assumption of a linear relationship between voltage and conductivity for small conductivity variations. For realistic calculations it is likely that this relationship is nonlinear and that the optimization so far is only somewhat useful. It is still possible to use the optimization covered so far, but as successive approximations to the true conductivity. Keeping in mind that the Jacobian and its inverse are an array of gradients, and that

The singular value decomposition alone is not sufficient to solve practical problems which involve noise. It may inadvertently change in the rank of the Jacobian, so that its inversion leads to erroneous results. One common method is to introduce regularization, and there are several kinds, two of which will be covered. They all involve constraining the conductivity so that it retains 'reasonable' values while at the same time the inverse, though not exact exists. The first is Tikhonov regularization and it is essentially a simple penalty function:

A gradient search method may be visualized as a search for a hill or valley depending on whether a maximum or a minimum are desired.

the single variable case, second derivatives are neglected (although they need not be) for simplification purposes. These optimization methods and their variants work for practical reconstructions in EIT. They are all seemingly unconstrained optimizations, and they all search conductivity space to find the set of conductivities that will allow the forward problem to match experimental measurements with varying success. The reconstruction of EIT is not so straightforward and it is amazing how far simple optimization can lead to success given the ill-posed ness of the problem. Although it is not apparent, the constraints are indirectly used in the objective functions in the form of the Jacobian, and in a standard optimization they would be multiplied by Lagrangian multipliers. As the Jacobian is included in the objective function, all constraints are always active saving much algebra which would otherwise result, though at the cost of adequately representing nonlinear conductivities.

conductivity together with regularization in EIT was surpassed by a more applicable method. Optimization is useful if no relation is known to exist between measured (in EIT it is voltage, in MAET it is current density) and inferred (conductivity) quantities. In MAET, there was a definite relation, and optimization was not needed.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT}. It uses well defined physics and easily available technology to image conductivity (and impedance) safely, but research continues for improved impedance imaging. The inverse for EIT was presented in detail because it was tried as a prototype to the inverse in MAET. Both modalities are designed to measure the electrical conductivity within a volume conductor, but it is MAET which promises higher resolution conductivity images, made possible by an emf created inside the volume by ultrasound. The inverse for MAET should also accommodate this innovation, and indeed the optimization in the

In practice, an ultrasound transducer not only has a finite size, but it also has a curvature, so that the pressure produced is focused into a relatively small volume. The plane wave solutions derived so far are more of an idealization of a focused transducer but the basic relations still hold. In re-visiting Euler's equation:

Using the effect of a Lorentz force on a charged fluid particle due to its velocity, a solution was made using COMSOL. Recalling that electric field is a gradient of a scalar potential, density is

The pressure and velocity potential are just proportional to one another and can be interchanged. This approach also has the advantage that both the velocity potential and the pressure are scalars, which is simpler to work with.

The focal region is clearly distinguished in Figure 25. The simulated transducer was positioned above the page facing down towards the phantom. The magnetic field is assumed to have only a constant positive, and nonzero y component in this simulation, so that

The assumption in the reciprocity theorem, is that the ultrasound would resolve the lead field current density to within the size of a point, but this is just an approximation. Instead, the field from the ultrasound has the form shown in Figure 26. In this plot, the electric field is significant in a finite volume, but reciprocity may still be applied.

In the actual experiments, the focal point would be scanned along the x-axis (horizontal line of symmetry), and the current density would be deduced from voltage measurements at electrodes placed on either side of this line of symmetry. With the

The value of the lead field current density near zero on the horizontal axis will be a centroid weighted about this function. An integral of this electric field a test function such as the lead field current density is known as a distribution[23], since the electric field
