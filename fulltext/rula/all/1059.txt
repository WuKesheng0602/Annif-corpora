Abstract
This thesis is about investigating a potential imaging modality, magneto-acousto-electrical tomography (MAET), to provide high-spatial-resolution images of lead field current density and electrical impedance of biological tissues. A lead field current density distribution is the one obtained when a current/voltage source is applied to a sample via a pair of electrodes.

I further authorize Ryerson University to reproduce this thesis by photocopying or by other means, in total or in part, at the request of other institutions or individuals for the purpose of scholarly research.

The lead field current density distribution can potentially be used to obtain electrical impedance distribution which is helpful in differentiating normal and cancerous tissues. To image lead filed current density, instead of directly applying a current/voltage source to the sample, the sample is placed in a static magnetic field and an ultrasound is focused on it to simulate a point like current dipole source in the focal zone. Electrodes are used to detect the voltage/current generated by the ultrasound in the sample, which according to the reciprocity theorem is proportional to a component of the lead field current density.

Introduction
1.1 Electrical properties of a biological tissue

The biological tissue consists of cells and extra-cellular fluid. The constituents of a tissue determine its electrical properties. The cells occupy roughly 80% of the tissue volume and contain intra-cellular fluid inside a lipid membrane. The extra-cellular fluid is the ·

medium surrounding the cells. It contains proteins, electrolytes, plasma and the interstitial fluid. The cell contains the protoplasm that contains the cytosol, the organelles and the

nucleus of the cell as shown in figure 1.1 [ 1].

1.1.1 Charge carriers in a tissue
Both the intra-cellular and extra-cellular fluids in a tissue contain electrolytes. The charge in an electrolyte is carried by the ions, unlike electrons in the metals. The positive charge carriers are called cations and the negative charge carriers are called anions. The total ionic conductivity of a solution depends on a number of factors e.g. concentration, activity, charge and mobility of all free ions in the solution. The most common ions contributing towards the ionic current are K+, Na+ and Ca2+. The ionic conductivity is also influenced by the viscosity and the temperature of the solution.

hydrophilic and a hydrophobic side. The hydrophobic sides attract each other and forces the hydrophilic head into the exterior and the hydrophobic into the interior of the structure. The plasma membrane is considered as an insulator. The overall structure in a

biological tissue formed by the intracellular fluid (conductor), plasma membrane (insulator) and extra-cellular fluid (conductor) acts as a capacitor. The bi-layer structure contains proteins of various types. The proteins pass through the lipid bi-layer creating very narrow channels for ions and water to pass. When viewed electrically this acts as a resistive path which allows current to pass.

1.1.2 Cellular plasma membrane
The cell is completely elclosed in a plasma membrane that consists mainly of proteins and lipids. The plasma membrane is a thin and elastic structure with a width of roughly 100

1.1.4 Frequency dependence of impedance

Figure 1.3 (a): Schematics of a typical capacitor, (b): Equivalent circuit diagram

If the applied voltage is sinusoidal then the electrical characteristics of the circuit in figure 1.3(b) varies with frequency and can be specified in several ways. At the excitation frequency m, the complex admittance y* can be expressed as:

A biological tissue is considered as a dispersive medium and both permittivity and conductivity are functions of frequency as shown in figure 1.4 [2]. This observed frequency dependence is called dispersion and it arises from several mechanisms as shown in [4]. Dispersions can be understood in terms of the orientation of the dipoles and the motion of

(1.3)

ions. At relatively low frequencies, it is easier for the dipoles to orient in response to the changes in the applied field, whereas the ions travel larger distances over which a greater

opportunity exists for trapping at a defect or interface.

Therefore at low frequencies,

able to diffuse through the narrow protein channels. Hence the total impedance of the tissue is large. The B-dispersion occurs in the frequency range from 10 kHz to 100 MHz. The Bdispersion is because of the partial charging of the cell membrane. The current at these higher frequencies is able to flow through the lipid membrane, charging the small intracellular space structures. Hence in B-dispersion the total impedance of the tissue is smaller. The 8-dispersion, centered at frequencies between 100 MHz and 1 GHz, is due to the relaxation of bound water molecules, small proteins, amino acids and protein side chains [4]. The y-dispersion is centered at 20 GHz and is due to the dipole moment of free water molecules.

permittivity is relatively high and conductivity is relatively low. As the frequency increases, the dipoles are less able to follow the changes in the applied field and the corresponding polarization disappears. In contrast, the ions travel shorter distances during each half cycle and are less likely to be trapped. As the frequency increases the permittivity decreases and since trapping becomes less important the conductivity increases. Four dispersion regions are identified namely a-, B-, 8- andy-dispersion.

1.1.5 Equivalent circuit model of a biological cell
Considering the main constituents of the cell as introduced earlier and applying the
Frequency [Hz] Frequency [Hz]

theory of electric circuits, it is possible to deduce an equivalent electrical model of a cell as shown in figure 1.5(a) [2]. Figure 1.5(b) represents simplified cell model. The resistance Rm parallel to the capacitance Cm can be neglected, since its value is quite high. The model can

counter-ion effect which is the formation of an electric double layer as a result of the ionic diffusion through the membrane. The ion passes through the narrow channels of the proteins as shown in figure 1.2. The characteristic frequency range of this dispersion is from 1 Hz to 10 kHz. The a-dispersion is because of the complete charging and discharging of the outer membrane of the cells. The current is not able to penetrate the lipid membrane but is only 6 7

regime showed a significant difference in the

electrical properties between healthy liver tissues and tumours. Results show that tumour conductivity is 6-7.5 times higher than normal liver conductivity; the difference in permittivity values is 2-5 times. However, the dielectric properties of tumours cannot be generalized as large differences exist between different tumour types and even between tumours of the same type. Electrical properties depend greatly on the size or the

to the conductivity changes in regions far from the electrodes, the shielding effect [14-17] due to low conductivity fat or skull layer, and the errors related with the placement of electrodes on the body [15]. Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography [18] is based on the measurements of current density distribution inside a subject body using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While the current is injected through the electrodes attached to the body surface of the subject, at the same time MR images are obtained using a spin-echo sequence synchronized with the current pulses. The magnitude of the current density mapping can be computed from MR images. After that, the current density data is utilized to reconstruct the static cross-sectional resistivity images. The internal current density data eliminate the sensitivity problem in conventional EIT image reconstruction. The disadvantages of MREIT include the shielding effect, high cost due to the use of MRI, and the safety issue due to the injection of relatively long current pulses(---- 40 ms) into the body. Magnetic induction totnography [19-20] uses the interaction of an oscillating magnetic field with conductive media. The field excited by coils is perturbed by eddy currents in the object and the perturbed field can be measured by small coils arranged around the object. The conductivity (and permittivity) can be reconstructed from the measurements of the perturbed magnetic field outside the object. However, so far, MIT has not been able to produce high-spatial-resolution images and accurate reconstruction algorithms still need to be developed. Hence, currently, there is no readily available imaging modality to produce highresolution images of electrical conductivity of tissues for medical applications. 13

The imaging of electrical properties has been used in various clinical applications and continues to attract substantial research interest because of the functional nature of information it provides [6-7]. The electrical properties determine the pathways of current flow through the body and thus are very important in the analysis of a wide range of biomedical applications such as functional electrical simulation and the diagnosis and treatment of various physiological conditions with weak electric currents, radio frequency hyperthermia, electro-cardiography, and body composition. On a more fundamental level, knowledge of these electrical properties can lead to an understanding of the underlying basic biological processes. There are several methods for imaging electrical impedance such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT), magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT), and magnetic induction tomography (MIT). Each of the above techniques has its strength and weakness. However, none of them can produce high-spatial-resolution images of electrical impedance for any application. In electrical impedance tomography [8-13], many surface electrodes are attached to an object to measure the electric potentials produced by the injected currents. An impedance image can be reconstructed from a set of independent measurements of transfer impedances. The advantages of EIT are: low cost, patient safety, simplicity, rapid data collection, and potential for tissue characterization. The major disadvantage of EIT is that the spatial resolution is poor due to the ill-posedness of the corresponding inverse problem involved in image reconstruction. Other disadvantages include the low sensitivity of the surface voltage 12

experimentally, i.e. without directly applying a current/voltage source, the sample is placed in a static magnetic field and an ultrasonic pulse is focused on the sample to simulate a point like current dipole source at r as shown in figure 1.1 0. The vibrations of ions in the sample caused by the ultrasound can induce an electric current distribution via the Lorentz force mechanism. Consequently, a voltage/current can be measured through electrodes [21-24]. It will be shown in chapter 2 that the measured voltage/current is proportional to a component of Jab(r) based on the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetic waves [25].

The voltage/current detected by the electrodes attached to the sample is proportional information by using this technique, the first part is to obtain the current density distribution, to a component of Jab· This can be shown using the Reciprocity Theorem of electromagnetics the second part is to solve for conductivity from the measured current density distribution. [26-27]. The second part is called the inverse problem and is studied by another graduate student in our group. This thesis deals with the first part i.e. obtaining the current density distribution experimentally by combining acoustics and electro-magnetics. In its simplest sense the reciprocity theorem states that the relation between a source and the resulting probe/measurement remains unchanged when the position of the source and the probe/measurement point are interchanged. Reciprocity can be understood by utilizing (a) discrete model, which is simply an electric circuit consisting of discrete electrical components and (b) continuous model, which shows the validity of reciprocity in a volume conductor.
2.1.1 Discrete model

Reciprocity for discrete electrical components can be understood by examination of the two circuits shown in figure 2.1. In circuit 1, the 5 V source in branch A produces a current

h equal to 0.147 A in branch B. In circuit 2, the 5 V source is moved to branch B which
produces a current h equal to 0.14 7 A in branch A. The equality of both the currents h and h is due to the reciprocity.

current density at a given point in a biological tissue, it is not necessary to measure it directly by invasively placing a current probe at the location. Instead, a "point battery" can be

generated at the same location, no-invasively, by a combination of static magnetic field and a focused ultrasound. The voltage/current produced by this "point battery" can be measured at the boundary of the tissue.

2.1.2 Continuous model
Reciprocity for a continuous model can be understood by looking at two volume conductors as shown in figure 2.2.

In the left diagram of figure 2.2, a galvanometer G is connected at the surface of the volume conductor. Inside the conductor is a thin double layered source representing a dipole across which the voltage is Vd and which causes a current IL in the galvanometer circuit.

The Lorentz force mechanism E; = v x Bo can be considered as an applied (impressed) electric field which induces an electric field of E1 in the sample, where v is the vibration velocity of ions in the ultrasound field and Bo is the static magnetic field.

If an ultrasound is focused on the tissue, the vibration velocity v can be localized to a small volume in space as shown in figure 2.3. The length and cross-section of this volume are determined by the ultrasound pulse width and the beam diameter respectively.

In this case, J ah is the current density distribution induced in the sample if a current of 1 Ampere is applied through the two coil terminals, a and b.

This section deals with the description of experimental setup for MAET.

schematics of the MAET setup is shown in figure 1.10. A photograph of the experimental setup is shown in figure 3.1. The sample is placed in a static magnetic field of 0.2-0.3 T verified by the hall probe. For most of the experiments a function generator is used to generate a burst of sinusoidal waves with a central frequency equal to that of the ultrasound transducer, which passes through the power amplifier and then to the transducer. The

function generator also synchronizes the triggering of the data acquisition card attached to a PC and the excitation of the transducer. The voltage detected by the electrodes is amplified before the data acquisition. As shown in figure 1.1 0, the ultrasound beam transmitted by the transducer strikes perpendicularly on the face of the sample, this is essential in MAET in order to produce a stronger signal. Since the total MAET signal is the summation of all individual signals produced by each point of the sample in the ultrasound beam. The spatial extent of the pulse along the transducer axis (or the wave propagation direction) defines the axial resolution (i.e. the resolution along the transducer beam). If the transducer produces a burst of duration r P , then the axial resolution is given by l P = v s r P, where v s = 1. 5 mm/jjs is the speed of the ultrasound in water or soft tissues. The lateral resolution (i.e. the resolution perpendicular to the transducer beam) is determined by the ultrasound beam width

3.3 Verification of MAET signals

3.3.1 MAET signal from a single point

The MAET signal (i.e. measured voltage) is first verified by us1ng a thick gel phantom sample as shown in figure 3.6. By thick it means, that the dimension of the sample along the ultrasound propagation axis (i.e. z-axis) is much larger than the wavelength of the ultrasound in gel which is 1.5 mm for 1 MHz transducer. The sample has a 1 em x 2 em x 0.8 em rectangular cavity in the middle. When the sample is placed in the oil, that cavity is filled up by the oil. A 1 MHz transducer connected to a function generator produces 2 J.!S duration ultrasonic pulses. The time trace of the voltage detected by the electrodes is related to the current density profile along the sound path.

When the ultrasound is incident at point A on the sample shown in figure 3.6, it travels throughout the thick sample without encountering the cavity. The MAET signal obtained is shown in figure 3.7. The MAET signal is recorded from the interface of two mediums with different conductivities. The reason behind it will be explained later.

transducer to the front (oil-gel) and rear (gel-oil) interfaces. This suggests that the signal is caused by the ultrasonic pulses. The MAET signal at 79 J.!S is weaker than the one at 59 J.!S. This is primarily because of the non-perpendicular incidence of the ultrasound beam on the rear face of the sample. The ultrasound pulse also attenuates as it travels through the gel but the non-perpendicular incidence is the main reason behind the weakening of the pulse. As

discussed the MAET signal at a given transducer position is the summation of all individual signals produced by each point of the sample in the ultrasound beam. If the ultrasound strikes perpendicularly on the sample (figure 3.8(a)), then the signal from each point in the ultrasound beam adds up constructively giving a stronger signal and when the ultrasound strikes at an angle (figure 3.8(b)), the signals from each point of the sample in the ultrasound beam may cancel each other resulting in a weaker signal.

This is because the As discussed previously, the MAET signal is detected only at the interface of two ultrasound velocity in oil is smaller than in gel.

In the case the sample is considered to In MAET the signal is an integration of (vx B0 ) ·Jab over the spatial extent of the ultrasound pulse, as shown in equation 2.8. v is spatially oscillatory with the period of ultrasound wave. The transducer in the experiments is driven by a sinusoidal wave, so the The geometry of the thin sample is shown in figure 3.13. It has two wide regions and integration of v over the spatial extent of the ultrasound pulse is zero because of the positive a narrow strip in the middle.

regions having different conductivities. Consequently, when the ultrasound pulse propagates within a uniform part of the sample, the integration of (v x Bo) ·Jab over the spatial extent of the ultrasound pulse reduces to a value proportional to the integration of v over the spatial extent of the ultrasound pulse, and this latter integration results in zero. Therefore, this oscillatory nature of the ultrasonic wave renders a signal that is very small inside the homogeneous part of the sample. At the interface of regions having different conductivities, there is a step change in Jab , which yields an integration of (v x Bo) ·Jab over the spatial extent of the ultrasound pulse that is much larger than that of the non-boundary points (i.e. 34

For the above sample the current density is approximately uniform along the z-axis. Assuming that v and Bo in equation 2.8 do not change during the scanning. Then the amplitudes of the signals at the instant when the ultrasound pulse reaches the sample can be used to represent the current density at the focal point of the ultrasound. A 2.25 MHz transducer connected to a function generator is used to generate an ultrasound burst with a full width half maximum pulse length of about 5 J.lS.

This agrees with the 1:3 ratio between the heights of the sample at the narrow and wider portions of the sample along y-axis. Since the area of the narrow strip is three times smaller than area of the wide region therefore the current density in the narrow strip is three times larger than the wider area. The dashed line corresponds to line 1 1 and shows that the current density drops to noise level in the center region because the focal point is within the insulating oil where

3.4.3 Improvement of SNR by CHIRP
Since J ab is defined as the current density distribution in the sample if a current of 1 Ampere is applied to the sample, J ab is inversely proportional to the thickness or cross sectional area of the sample; this can be deduced from the fundamental equation 2.8. Therefore the MAET signal will decrease with increasing thickness of the sample. For a thin sample, high spatial resolution MAET signal can be obtained with high SNR. For a thick sample, in order to obtain high SNR MAET signals, either the ultrasound pressure has to be increased or a long ultrasound chirp burst would be used and the data would be processed by the pulse compression techniques to obtain high axial resolution [30-31 ].

After obtaining MAET signals from the gel phantoms, experiments are performed on biological tissues. For all the experiments fresh pork meat is used. The sample has layers of muscle and fat tissues. All the experiments for the biological tissues are performed with 1 MHz transducer. Table 3.3 gives acoustic properties of muscle and fat at 1 MHz [32].

Experiments are performed on two different biological samples, one having two layers (muscle-fat) and the other having four layers (muscle-fat-muscle-fat). Figure 3.22 shows the top view of a 2-layered biological sample. Three interfaces are visible. Interface 1 is between oil and muscle, interface 2 is between muscle and fat and the interface 3 is between fat and oil. The dimension of the sample along the ultrasound z-axis is approximately 1.5 em. The dimension along y-axis is approximately 0.9 em. A pulse of 1 flS duration from a function generator is applied to the 1 MHz transducer. The scanning is done between the dashed lines along the x-axis with a step size of2 mm.

inhomogeneous and has regions of varying conductivity then the placement of electrode becomes important and affects the distribution of current. For example if a sample has two regions, one is of higher conductivity while the other is of lower conductivity, and if both the electrodes are placed in the higher conductivity region, then the current distribution would only be in the higher conductivity region since it's a least resistive path. Now, if the

electrodes are placed so that they cover both regions of conductivity, then the current will be distributed in both the regions with higher conductivity region having more current density than the lower conductivity region. The electrodes for MAET experiments are simply a bundle of small wires as shown in figure 3.24.

Figure 3.29: Tomographic images at cross-sections along y-axis

Although in the first (1-3) and the last (12-14) images, the transducer does not point directly on the sample, all the 4 interfaces are somewhat visible, but they are relatively weaker and have thicker boundaries. This is due to the blurring of the interfaces as compared with the other cross sections. The 1 MHz transducer has a relatively large beam diameter (of about 8 mm), so even if the transducer is not focused directly on the sample, part of the acoustic energy still falls on the sample and generates MAET signal. In image 7, all

interfaces are clearly visible and have sharp boundaries because the focal point falls directly on the sample. When carefully observed differences in internal structures can also be found

Challenges and Conclusions
MAET signals are expected at the interfaces between cells and sub-cellular components.
4. 1 Challenges and possible solutions

Many of these small signals add up together and this accumulation generates speckle, in the same manner as in sonography speckles are generated by many small, randomly distributed scattered acoustic waves. In sonography, speckles have been used to characterize the tissues [33-34]. In principle these methods can be adapted in MAET to analyze speckles in order to determine the local current density. Experiments discussed in this thesis are mostly

I have presented a preliminary study on MAET as a potential imaging method for lead field current density and electrical impedance. High-spatial-resolution current density distribution is obtained for the first time for a thin gel phantom. Experimental results are compared with the numerical simulation and good agreement is observed. 2-D and 3-D MAET images for biological tissues are also obtained. But there are several challenges which need to be addressed before MAET can be a quantitative imaging modality of current density and electrical impedance. The first and the foremost challenge is obtaining MAET signals from the interior of a homogeneous sample. So far the MAET signals are only detectable at the interfaces of two mediums of different conductivity. The signals from the interface are still useful and tell us about the electrical heterogeneity of the sample. But it is much more desirable to develop a quantitative imaging modality on electrical impedance by which signals can be obtained not only from the interfaces but also from the interior of the sample. There are different ways which can be investigated to overcome the cancellation of

performed by using 1 MHz transducer and no speckles are observed. Since the ratio between the signals generating speckles and the signals from interfaces increases with ultrasound frequency [35]. Therefore, in our future study we will use transducers with higher frequency to explore the speckles in MAET. Another possible method to generate MAET signals from the homogeneous part of a sample is to utilize radiation force to generate non-linear MAET signals from the interior of samples by taking advantage of unidirectional nature of radiation force. When an acoustic wave is propagating in the medium, part of its energy is attenuated through absorption and scattering in the medium. Consequently, the momentum carried by the attenuated energy (or phonons) is transferred to the medium and a radiation force is exerted upon the medium. The radiation force can be static and dynamic. In the static case, the radiation force contains a

In the ultrasound B-mode, the images of tissue contain a background that ultrasonic wave that oscillates in space, the radiation force does not. Therefore, the volume has a granular like appearance. It is due to the presence of many small randomly distributed 54 integral of the force and the induced motion in the medium will not be zero. Consequently, 55 Unlike the incident

the MAET signal in equation 2.8 generated by the static radiation force will not cancel out. Similar conclusions can be found out for dynamic radiation force if the frequency of radiation force is properly chosen. For example, if the dimension of the sample is 10 em and· the radiation force has a frequency of below 7.5 kHz, corresponding to a wavelength larger

Several experiments are performed on gel Consequently, the MAET signal from different points of the interior of the sample will not phantoms and excised biological tissues. MAET signal is verified for a thick gel sample by cancel each other. checking the flight time. High-spatial-resolution current density distribution is obtained for MAET signals are inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the sample under investigation. Normally the cross-sectional area of the subjects in clinical applications is much larger than that of the samples used in our initial experiments. Therefore, the MAET signals in clinical applications will be much weaker than these in our preliminary experiments. The strength of the signal can be improved by using a high voltage pulser to generate stronger ultrasound wave. Also the MAET signals are directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field so a stronger magnet would improve the signal strength. Lastly, CHIRP can be used to improve the SNR of MAET signals further, as demonstrated in Chapter 3 of this thesis. the first time for a thin gel phantom. Experimental results are compared with the numerical simulation and good agreement is observed. It is shown that chirp can be used to improve the SNR of MAET signals. 2-D and 3-D MAET images for biological tissues are obtained. Our investigations provide the proof-of-principle that MAET can be an imaging modality showing the interfaces between different biological tissues. But there are several challenges which need to be addressed before MAET can be a quantitative imaging modality of current density and electrical impedance. More investigations need to be carried out to understand the full potential of this novel imaging modality.

4.3 Conclusion
New methods need to be explored to detect the MAET signal. One possibility is to For thin samples high spatial resolution images for lead field current density use coil as discussed in the end of chapter 2. This method is more robust than the detection distribution is obtained. For thick samples signals are only obtained from the interfaces that by attaching electrodes to the sample. Because the detection with coil doesn't need the are related to the current density distribution. contact with the sample as in the electrode detection case, which might result in large investigations are required to make MAET a quantitative imaging modality. variation in the detected signals due to the changes in electrode position and contact impedance between different measurements. In addition, the coil detection method provides 56 57 It is concluded that more rigorous
