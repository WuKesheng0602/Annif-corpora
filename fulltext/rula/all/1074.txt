ABSTRACT

I further authorize Ryerson University to reproduce this paper by photocopying or by other means, in total or in part, at the request of other institutions or individuals for the
purpose of scholarly research.

"South Asian" is a term commonly used in Canada to refer to individuals with

ancestry in the Indian subcontinent and surrounding countries. The label has been created
through Canada's means of statistical data collection on visible minority populations.
Signature

Drawing from sociological, cultural studies, and geographic literature, this exploratory study seeks to determine the reciprocal relationship between South Asian identities as
they are considered in Canada and urban space in Toronto. The research has been conducted through a critical review of literature regarding ethnic identity, hybridity, the

production of urban space, and two key informant interviews. The key findings of the

research suggest that South Asian identities are often multiple/situational, and that certain

aesthetic aspects of South Asian identity are displayed in urban spaces in Toronto which
may be labelled South Asian. These spaces may be considered hybrid spaces.

Canada's high levels of immigration mean multiple ethnic groups reside in the

country's metropolitan areas (Bauder and Sharpe, 2002, p. 205). These groups are often classified as ethnic minorities or visible minorities when compared to Canada's perceived
Caucasian majority population (Symmott & Howes, 1996, p. 141). Visible minorities are

often lead to a hybridization of migrant and diaspora identities.

In order to consider the questions raised by the article, it was imperative to determine

what identity means to immigrant and visible minority populations in Toronto. The era of
postmodern scholarship has rejected ideas of biologically determined identities (Phadnis

Hybrid identities may exist in social space (Verkuyten, 2004), gendered space

(Butler, 1990; Rose, 1993), colonial space (Bhabha, 1996), and urban space (AlSayyad,
2001; Sandrecock, 2003); each position creating its own struggle to produce and define
space and identity. The urban spaces discussed in this paper are interpreted as socially constructed. Instead of a platform for social interaction, space is created by the

identity. In this framework, identity is "historically, not biologically, defined.. .formed and transformed in relation to the ways we are represented or addressed in the cultural systems which surround us" (Hall, 1996a, p. 598). Identity is "constantly in flux" (Davis,

This kind of collective belonging also means group identities are formed by illuminating the differences between self and other: "identity becomes visible as the point where.. .one subject or agent may come to see itself in others, to be itself through its mediated relationships with others, and to see others in itself (Gilroy, 1996, p. 228).

1. IDENTITY AND ETHNIC MINORITY IDENTITY:

Paul Gilroy (2005) writes that current state-centred concepts of ethnicity make it "impossible to imagine that local, national, and ethnic connections and loyalties do not
exhaust any individual" (p. 23). Ethnic identities are becoming a key organizing feature
for social interaction; "This is a time in which what (no longer even who) you are can

This definition suggests that ethnic identity requires a personal attachment to the ethnic community and that international migration can change both the way ethnic groups are formed and the way individuals identify with their ethnicity. Race, "a category of physical characteristics" (Isajiw, 1999, p. 21) which
individuals may possess, and ethnicity, are becoming synonymous categories. Cultural and ethnic belonging is supplanting the term "race" in discourses of difference and belonging (Gilroy, 2005, p. 36-37). Nonetheless, both race and ethnicity are "products of interaction between diverse populations" and often formed by outsider interpretations
(Cornell & Hartmann, 2007, p. 32). Race, like ethnicity, is a social rather than a biological phenomenon. According to Isajiw (1999), people do not frequently form

The category of visible minority is problematic for a number of reasons; it racializes

those populations labelled visible minorities (Ibid.) and denies that Canada's Caucasian
population contains multiple 'minority' populations within it (Symmot & Howes, 1996). The idea of visible minority is not synonymous with ethnic minority, however, as not all ethnic minorities in Canada are visible as non-white (Ibid., p. 141). The use of the term
visible minority implies that Canada's Caucasian population is not visible (Isajiw, 1999,

racial characteristics only "as a response to being categorized and excluded by outsiders" (p. 22). Ethnicity on the other hand is not always an imposed classification; it often has
origins in a group's own process of self-definition (Cornell & Hartmann, 2007, p. 28).

2002; Tran, Kaddatz, & Allard, 2005). Categorizations such as visible minority status mean that immigrant groups often only gain an ethnic identity after migrating and being placed in a category which they previously did not know existed, or did not identify with.
The process of migration can consequently create ethnic and minority groups (Cornell & Hartmann, 1997, p. 31). Therefore, visible minority identities are only relevant in Canadian national space. The use of large, pre-determined categories of visible minority

There are three primary means of considering ethnic identity: the primordialist,

The final means of considering identity, situational identity, describes instances in which individuals choose which identity, personal or social, to emphasize in a given situation (Sets & Burke, 2000, p. 231). When considering ethnic identities, situational

ethnicity, primordialism is often blamed for stereotypical and prejudicial ideas which
render identity static and unchanging (Butler 1990; Gilroy 2006; HaU, 1996c; Verkuyten,

explains a form of situational ethnic identity with a term borrowed from the study of
linguistics; "code switching" (Georgiou, 2006, p. 63). This concept is discussed in more
depth below.

The alternative viewpoint, constructivism, grew out of the field of sociology (Hall,

1996a, p. 597); in this case, ethnic identities are socially constructed, and occasionally
consciously chosen (Nagel, 1994; Phadnis and Ganguly, 2001; Verkuyten, 2004).

2. HYBRID IDENTITIES

Hybrid identities occur through a mixing and combining of multiple cultural identity traits outside of "exclusionary, fixed, binary notions of identity" (McLeod, 2000,

and "conceptualized as the relationship between subjects and broader discursive

groups either through colonial settlement or interaction between diverse populations in
countries of migration (Ibid,).

The literature discussed above considers concepts of hybridity as they relate to

individuals' interpretations of their own ethnic identity. However, in order to answer the research questions guiding this work, it is crucial to consider the ways in which hybrid identities are performed in and change physical spaces. The following section explores three areas of scholarship in hybridity and space: hybridity as a postcolonial theory; the
practice of hybrid identities in daily life and space; and existing empirical research.
Homi Bhabha, the seminal scholar in postcolonial theories of hybridity (McLeod,

situations (p. 20). Vertovec (1999), drawing from Stuart Hall, posits that the diaspora

essay "Culture's in-between" summarizes how colonial and postcolonial population
movements have created "in-between" or "partial cultures" through mixing the cultural traits of colonizers with those of the local population (p. 54). According to Bhabha, the
new cultures were simultaneously similar to their original incarnations, but also unique; no longer recognizable or tied to a particular territory (Bhabha, 1996, p. 54). He questions assumptions that culture is a purely national phenomenon, noting that within this national

experience is entirely coloured by hybridity and cultural fluidity (p. 20). However, what
Vertovec and Scheffer do not emphasize strongly enough is that the process of
hybridization also works in reverse, changing how identity is experienced by newcomers

as well as the existing population in the country of migration. There is a reciprocal relationship between groups, producing hybridity on both sides (Bhabha, 1996, p.54).
Hybrid identities can also be expressed through personal choice, rather than

ascribed through country of residence or comparisons with other ethnic groups. Like the

illustrates the subjectivity of hybridity, and its contingency upon personal experience. Canada's urban centres, as the primary destinations for immigrants to the country (Bauder & Sharpe, 2002, p. 205) are natural sites for hybrid identities to form. The daily interaction between individuals of different ethnic groups (Goonewardena & Kipfer, 2005, p. 676) and the proximity of ethnic neighbourhoods to each other will undoubtedly
lead to this kind of reciprocal exchange (Scheffer, 2003, p. 153).

and hegemony used by Lefebvre, in which gaining the right to the city requires overcoming barriers prohibiting marginalized groups from fully participating in placemaking (Goonewardena & Kipfer, 2005, p. 676). Goonewardena and Kipfer (2005) state that Canada's doctrines of multiculturalism have falsely reified performances and
displays of hybridity in Toronto. Consumerist cosmopolitan doctrines have prevented any real intercultural engagement in the city, or a true appropriation of space. This
consumerist ideology has in turn prevented minority groups from gaining the right to the city (p. 675). Multiculturalism, according to these two authors, is a profit-driven creation
designed to promote commercial displays of ethnicity and hybridity (Ibid.). 'Cosmopolitan' has become the label of choice for major urban centres desiring to

This section reviews the literature regarding the production of space by different

social groups as well as the historical processes which have prevented the appropriation
and production of urban space in cosmopolitan and multicultural cities. Urban space is not distributed equally, nor does it equally represent all city residents (Isin and
Siemiatycki, 1999, pg. 5). There are two primary explanations for this inequality: a Marxist viewpoint which discusses unequal distribution of space based on economic class (Lefebvre, 1976,1991; Purcell, 2003); and a culturalist viewpoint which looks at inequality through the lens of cosmopolitanism and urban ethnic diversity (Qadeer, 1997;
Sandrecock, 2003)

Philosopher Henri Lefebvre uses class conflict to explain how space is used and produced in the modern city. Discussing neglect in urban planning, Lefebvre argues that space is considered normatively by governments and planners, without due consideration
for the social needs of those who would use it (Lefebvre, 1976, p.30). Brenner (2004) asserts that space is in fact political and representative of societies' power-holding classes. The exclusive representation of elite interests in urban space alienates its unprivileged

governance, according to Binnie et al prioritises aesthetically cosmopolitan urban environments rather than the actual needs of transnational urban communities (Binnie et al., 2006, p. 16). In order to be marketed as cosmopolitan, diversity has to be visible in
urban spaces (Calhoun, 2001; Sandrecock, 2003). Within this framework, immigrant and

transnational groups can benefit by being encouraged to spatially display their ethnic

users (p. 79). In many urban settings ethnic minorities form these underprivileged groups
(Isin and Siemiatycki, 1999, p. 5). In order for urban groups to produce their own space, they must have access to

not true representations of their needs (Isin & Siemiatycki, 1999; Mitchell, 1997b). Racialized and immigrant groups are often disadvantaged by hegemonic

AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF SOUTH ASIANS IN TORONTO
In order to explore some of the themes emerging from this literature review, a
short exploratory study was conducted in the form of in-depth interviews with two key
informants during the summer of 2009 in Toronto. The key informants were chosen
because of their academic work in the fields of immigration and South Asian identity and because they had acknowledged some connection with the idea of South Asian.

classes onto space (Agrawal & Hathiyani, 2007, p. 135). Similarly, Isin and Siemiatycki
(1999), andQadeer (1997), explain hegemony in the production of space as aresult of

institutionalized discrimination and Eurocentric norms in aesthetic and spatial
preferences (Isin & Siemiatycki, 1999, p. 12; Qadeer, 1997, p. 482).

Leonie Sandrecock (2003) perceives a link between identity and space, especially
in multicultural and cosmopolitan urban environments. She explains: "When residents with different histories, cultures and needs appear in 'our' cities, their presence disrupts the taken-for-granted categories of social life and urban space" (p. 20). The above

interviews provide a thick description of the how the informants interpret and experience
South Asian identity and its relevance to urban space in Toronto. Two major themes were covered in the topical interviews; the exploration of
South Asian Identity, and the identification of South Asian Spaces in the Toronto CMA. Under the first theme, the participants were requested to describe how they felt about the term South Asian, the specific situations in which they were likely to self identify as South Asians, and markers of South Asian identity. Under the second theme, the

By grounding my research in constructivism and theories of socially constructed identities, I am likely to challenge many commonly accepted ideas of how individuals
navigate their own identities and understand life in Canada. Such epistemological and

ontological predispositions lead me to question the utility of a multiculturalism based on

national, or in this case regional, ethnic identities, and common understandings of ethnic
identity as singular and national (Beck, 2006, p. 27; Gilroy, 2005, p. 23).

The scholarship reviewed above illustrates how individuals navigate multiple
ethno-racial identities and how these identities may be variously expressed in physical
spaces. The two interviews were conducted to further explore these ideas and the three
main research questions that have guided this project

Dasmohapatra, & Shakir, 2004; Ghosh, 2006)3. The key informants confirmed these
ideas to a large extent.
South Asian: An externally imposed and internalised identity

Corroborating Ghosh's contentions about South Asian identity, the key
informants pointed out that the term South Asian is created by the Canadian census. Although they would not consistently want to identify themselves as South Asian, they

and it was after I discovered how I was being labelled, particularly in the census data" (Interview with Naseem, 2009). Sumir suggests that Canada's means of data collection

on ethno-racial and visible minority populations have "created" the ethno-racial category of South Asian in this country; being South Asian is not inherent in an individual, but "is

interpreted and race-based statistics collected in Canada, South Asian is something which must be "adopted." Thus, for both key informants, "South Asian" is an externally
imposed identity.

Sumir discusses modulating his cultural performance in different situations:

ethno-racial markers.

South Asian appears to be a flexible concept which can be used or not used

depending on the situation (however, both respondents concede that this level of choice is
not present in the collection of official statistics). While this flexibility does not necessarily confirm that South Asian identity is hybrid, it does suggest that some who

Qadeer, (1999) explains that these dispersed commercial areas, rather than being localized in South Asian residential neighbourhoods,

catering to other ethnic groups" rather than residential centres (Qadeer, 1999, p. 19).

Naseem considers ethnic spaces in terms of recognizable enclaves or commercial
areas like Ghinatown. She states that since Toronto's South Asians are residentially
dispersed in "pockets" around the city that the community cannot appropriate space in the
same way as other groups with a more localized population: "[South Asian space] isn't as large as I would say like a Chinatown which is much larger, much more well-established. But these are smaller pockets but you do see artefacts of South Asian culture in those
spaces" (Interview with Naseem, 2009).

Naseem's comments below appear to directly echo this research and indicate that there is a separation between South Asian commercial spaces and dispersed residential space, as
well as a large number of South Asian commercial areas spread around the city. South

Asian public and private spaces were differentiated by the key informants: defining residential spaces as private space and commercial spaces as public space. Sumir sets apart "South Asian identity in public" from South Asian identity in

general (Interview with Sumir, 2009), suggesting that South Asian identity is best
represented and recognized in public space. Sumir states that there is very little which is recognizable in private South Asian space, and that the material and aesthetic

Sumir and Naseem emphasize that South Asian space is recognized by aesthetic, material, and commercial goods. Naseem again mentions the Gerrard India Bazaar as a South Asian space in addition to Thorncliffe Park, and parts of Scarborough and Mississauga. She identifies the presence of stores and shops selling South Asian food and products as definitive signifiers of South Asian space (Interview with Naseem, 2009). Within public space, Sumir says that representations of consumer and material culture are the predominant ways in which South Asian space is recognized, and possibly the only things which make public spaces South Asian. Without these uses and traits
"space is just space;" it is neutral:
Space is just space. Is it private or public? Space encompasses many things. There can be a South
Asian mall or a store, but spaces are the buildings, structures, roads, surrounding areas. Spaces

demonstrations which make up South Asian identities are found only in public: "Public
spaces have a public display of South Asian culture and physical form. Private spaces are not recognizable as South Asian. Homes and houses have very little display of South
Asian culture outside" (Interview with Sumir, 2009).

Naseem says that residential concentrations of South Asian people are an

important way to recognize South Asian space. When asked if there were South Asian
spaces in the city, Naseem responded by describing an area with a large South Asian
residential population:
There's a very large grocery store and there's a mosque, and in the buildings surrounding that area there's a lot of residents from South Asian background....so if you go to the school you see a lot of children from South Asian backgrounds so it seems there's a concentration of people from
South Asia in Thorncliffe Park area. (Interview with Naseem, 2009)

have been adapted for South Asian needs and to be used by South Asian people. I would be
careful saying South Asian space, though. (Interview with Sumir, 2009)

Therefore, according to Sumir, places where South Asian products are found, or where South Asian People go to receive services, are as close as one can get to South Asian
space. For Naseem, these kinds for spaces are definitively South Asian.

Although one may not immediately recognize private spaces as South Asian spaces, a
large South Asian residential population is enough for Naseem to consider space South
Asian.

simultaneously. There is the possibility that this is simply a preponderance of Indian

et al., 2005, p. 21); however, it is also possible that there is evidence of hybridity in the
spaces Naseem claims are simultaneously Indian and South Asian.

Naseem's descriptions of South Asian space suggest that it is defined by Indian

culture more than that of any other South Asian country. This is illustrated in an example regarding a theatre which shows only Indian films. Naseem defines this as South Asian
space. She describes the theatre:
There is a cinema... the Albion Cinema. And if you go see a movie there, they show Indian movies.. .And over there the audience used to be primarily people from South Asia. Even the food that you'd buy there for snacks would be Samosas and so on rather than popcorn (Interview with
Naseem, 2009)

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The above analysis offers multiple explanations of South Asian identity and its spatial expression in Toronto. When read in light of the literature review, a number of

similarities and connections can be found between the theoretical scholarship on the
topics of identity and space and the answers given by Naseem and Sumir.

The theatre showing Indian films for a South Asian audience is an example of a space

which "would definitely indicate the presence of people from South Asia," but Naseem clearly says that the theatre shows "Indian" and not South Asian films (Interview with
Naseem, 2009).

The interview analysis demonstrates that South Asian identity can be formed through a combination of inscribed and ascribed traits. As explained by Nagel (1994), ethnic identity "is a composite of the view one has of oneself as well as the views held by
others about one's ethnic identity" (p. 154). Some aspects such as aesthetic choices or

Naseem says that in order to recognize a South Asian space one should look for

evidence of film: "That is a big thing particularly in India. Not so much in Pakistan... .but
Indian film is a very strong feature of Indian culture" (Interview with Naseem, 2009). It

demeanour may be preferred and emphasized, while other "phenotypic" and ascribed

33

34

traits such as skin colour are not subject to the same kinds of individual choice and may
be assigned meaning by those outside the group (Marshall, 1994, p. 25). Therefore, as Naseem's and Sumir's answers illustrate, South Asian identity as it is perceived in
Canada is represented through inscribed traits such as dress in conjunction with traits

Naseem and Sumir believe stereotypes and preconceptions have developed which colour
the way Canadian discourse considers South Asian as a racial and ethnic identity (Ghosh
2000b, p. 4; Ghosh, 2007, p. 224; Patel, 2006, p. 150.

Phadnis and Ganguly (2001), drawing from the scholarship of Keyes, emphasize the need for members of an ethnic group to claim belonging in the collective in order for
it to be useful as a means of political organization or a tool for nationalism (Phadnis and
Ganguly, 2001, p. 25). Keyes (1981) in Phadnis and Ganguly (2001) states: "The most

over which one has less control like skin colour. As the informants have noted, they do
not accept these kinds of traits as equally salient, and will often prefer to identify with the inscribed traits they choose for themselves.

Both Sumir and Naseem emphasize that South Asian and its constituent national identities are imperfectly understood in Canada (Ghosh, 2007; Patel, 2006); neither participant wants to be identified with stereotypes and caricatures. Therefore, when given
the opportunity, they will situationally choose how they refer to themselves rather than
accepting the South Asian identity ascribed to them in Canada/Canada's long-standing categorization of South Asian as a visible minority/racial marker (Bauder and Sharpe,

crucial aspect of ethnic identity creation is that 'the symbols of ethnic identity must be
appropriated and internalized by individuals before they can serve as the basis for orienting people to social action'" (p. 25). Since South Asian is a category whose history and commonalities have been determined in Canada (Ghosh, 2000b, p. 4; Patel, 20069 pg. 150), the shared traits which would usually be accepted as representative by members of a given ethnic group are denied by a number of South Asians. The ethnicity has not been
internalized by either Sumir or Naseem, and if this is true of others in Canada, it may not be possible to consider South Asian as an ethnic identity at all. The interpretations of identity explained by Naseem and Sumir, however, echo

2002, p. 205; Tran et al, 2005, p. 21) means that the identity has become fixed. Markers

of visible minority status are not, however, enough to signify ethnic identity (Hall, 1996a,
pg. 617). Scholarship interpreting ethnicity and culture as biologically predetermined has

fallen out of favour to allow for more constructivist and non-racist explanations (Gilroy,
2005; Hall, 1996a; Phadnis & Ganguly, 2001). The two research participants appear to

the conclusions put forward by Mahtani (2002). Like Mahtani's participants who
"exercised their right to choose their own ethnic allegiances" (Mahtani, 2002, p. 25), Sumir and Naseem discuss the different situations in which they are willing to claim a
South Asian identity. Although they are not of "mixed race" like Mahtani's research

believe that Canada's creation of a visible minority category of South Asian has denied flexibility in defining the identity by endeavouring to produce a coherent ethnic group out

of disparate and diverse populations. Canada's categorization of South Asian as an ethnic
identity does not allow for the fluidity in group composition which is crucial in
definitions of ethnic identity (Davis, 2004, p. 184; Marshall, 1994, p. 202). Consequently,

participants (Ibid., p. 7), their responses do illustrate the ways in which identity is situational (Sets & Burke, 2000), as well as instances of choosing a desired identity from

Vertovec; 1999).

themes and determine questions for further investigation. While the two interviews
conducted generated rich data, the participants could not offer insight into all of the perspectives and opinions held by Toronto's south Asian population.

2. URBAN SPACE

If the same research questions were to be investigated more intensively, the
number of participants would be increased. Input would be sought from participants born
in Canada as well as those who had immigrated. Ideally, such a project would include
discussions with 12-16 participants who would share their experiences with hybridity, South Asian identity, and urban space in Toronto through guided focus group discussions.

Like South Asian identity, South Asian space was not uncritically accepted by

Sumir. It appears from Sumir's answers to questions regarding South Asian space that his
ideas of space are counter to theories put forth in the literature by Brenner (2004), Lefebvre (1976; 1991), and Purcell (2003) which explain a struggle to achieve "rights to
the city" (Purcell, 2003, p. 577) and appropriate urban public spaces. Sumir's statement

Focus groups would be the best method with which to approach these questions in
a larger project as they would allow me to study "how individuals collectively make
sense of a phenomenon and construct meanings around it" (Bryman and Teevan, 2005, p.

that "space is just space" that can only be "adapted" rather than claimed suggests he does
not believe that space in Toronto can be or has been appropriated by the South Asian
community. For Sumir there is no such thing as South Asian space.

group identity, it makes sense to query it in a group setting. The interactions which occur

in the presence of others with similar ideas (Bryman and Teevan, 2005, p. 194).

37

could consider the same questions with recent immigrants to Canada; with South Asian youth; and with second generation Canadian members of the South Asian population.
Information regarding hybrid identity and space in Toronto did not arise to the
extent expected in the two interviews. If focus group studies were conducted, specific

research questions addressed in this project are large in scope and the research conducted
merely scratched the surface of the topics under consideration.

It appears from this preliminary study that there is room for further exploration
into the research questions. Both informants have offered some criticism of Canada's use
of South Asian as a category for ethnic belonging and believe that its uses in this country are not amenable to internalizing South Asian as a personal identity. It may therefore be
possible to determine through further study a) why some in Canada choose to identify themselves as South Asian, and b) what they believe that claim illustrates about
themselves. Although the research project has not managed to fully address the questions arising from November's Globe and Mail article, it has helped create a better
understanding of some aspects of South Asian commercial spaces in Toronto. The interviews with Sumir and Naseem have created a framework from which to understand what makes South Asian space. They have also helped develop an understanding of what
the term South Asian actually means in Canada. If the malls described by Radhika (2008) really do focus on providing customers with clothing, food, and music (p. M2) which

questions could be asked to draw out experiences of hybridity among participants.

Questions developed for expanded focus group studies could query different aspects of

hybrid identity and its spatial representation, including asking participants to identify
specific spaces which represent or in which they perform multiple identities. Naseem's

discussion of spaces as simultaneously South Asian and Indian suggests that there may be
avenues for continued investigation on this point. As well, there is room for further

consideration on how Canadian norms of spatial representation and planning, such as discussed by Agrawal and Hathiyani (2007) and Isin and Siemiatycki (1999), are

incorporated in the kinds of South Asian spaces discussed in the key informant interviews.
The work included in this project is highly critical of Canada's homogenized use of South Asian as a marker of visible minority status. Continued research on the
connotations of the term and how it is interpreted by South Asians in Canada could have

policy implications. Continued study may be able to provide policy options for statistics
collection in Canada which better reflect diversity and self-identification within the
country's South Asian and other visible minority populations.

represents South Asia, then it appears, according to the evidence and explanations collected above, these spaces are in fact South Asian.

The literature review and two interviews included in this work are not intended to

be exhaustive, and are not in-depth enough to constitute a complete case study. However,
this research does lay the groundwork for a potential future project determining in what
ways hybridity and South Asian identity are represented spatially in Toronto. The
