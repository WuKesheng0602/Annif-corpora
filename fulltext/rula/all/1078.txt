Abstract
The omnipresence of wind, low production cost and much advancement within the field, wind power provides a vast and promising renewable energy resource. With the current high prices of oil and pressure to reduce carbon emissions, wind energy has achieved great interest creating high demands for innovative wind technology. Additionally, producing energy at the door step of consumers, such as at consumer dwellings in urban areas, wind power provides a means of producing efficient and reliable energy. The use of architectural structures to provide an augmentation source for the wind has been pursued by some ambitious architects but the effects of building augmentation are still uncertain. This study used computational fluid dynamic models to analyze varying building geometries and their effects on power augmentation. A porous region was used to model a wind turbine back pressure across the gap between the buildings. Results show augmentation increases power production one to two times compared to equivalent size free-standing wind turbines. Results also show that certain wind incidence angles provide the best augmentation indicating that building geometry is optimal when design takes into consideration winds regularity azimuth.

Introduction
Wind power is generating interest amongst many nations to produce cheaper and sustainable electrical power to combat the soaring prices on fossil fuels and to reduce CO2 emissions [20]. It is well known and documented that CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels is contributing to global warming which has been felt all around the world. Figure 1.1 shows the average global temperature change documented by NASA indicating a dramatic rise in temperature caused by CO2 emissions [3]. Fox [6] stated the world's energy demand has increased two fold from 1971 to 2003, and currently will increase 40% by the year 2020. It is imperative that renewable energies is further developed and integrated into power systems to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Compared to other renewable energies such as hydro, wave energy and solar, wind energy is the most promising form of renewable energy. It has sustained a 25% compounded rate of growth for over a decade and has exceeded a total capacity of 60,000MW [6]. The winds ability to produce power any hour of the day and season makes it a good source of energy [6]. Vast wind farms far from city centers have been constructed to mitigate the pressure of increased power demands due to growing urban areas. However, the great lengths of transmission lines used in power delivery to the areas are expensive to build and maintain, which makes wind farm energy less of an economical energy resource. The problem of the integration of wind turbines into the urban environment is the spatial constraints imposed on the turbine size. Wind turbines extract kinetic energy from the wind through the turbine capture area and power increases capture area. Imposing size limit constrains turbines to produce little energy and making wind energy in urban environments not appealing. A way to combat the size constraints was to increase power by increasing kinetic energy of the air. One method was to accelerate air velocities through a duct and a turbine by means of a pressure drop. It was shown ducted turbines boosted power and became integrated into the roof tops of some commercial building. Research has been done by Campbell [22] to utilize the airflow between buildings where wind speeds increase to pass through narrow gaps. The increased wind velocity that occurs between building structures is known as the venturi effect which many researchers are utilizing to increase kinetic energy of the wind to drive smaller turbines to produce equivalent energy yields to larger turbines in open fields. 1

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION The size of urban turbines are constrained by space in which makes them less viable compared with their larger stand alone counterparts [22]. Concerns with the implementation of turbine into urban areas are the energy yield and the return on investment. A system where two buildings are used to increase the winds kinetic energy is called building augmented wind turbine (BAWT). The Bahrain World Trade Center (BWTC) shown in Figure 1.2, was the first BAWT system to have been erected in 2008. Three 29m diameter turbines are suspended between its two tower facing north to take advantage of the blowing winds from the Persian Gulf from a 90 azimuth. The BWTC was shown to produce 11%­15% of the buildings electrical power [22]. Reasonings for the architectual building shape and optimized performance test results were not obtained. Campbell [22] found in his research an optimal shape that would generate best power augmentation. He derived his shape using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyse the shapes of the buildings and verified his results with scaled wind tunnel and field tests.

Figure 1.2: Bahrain World Trade Center (Manama, Bahrain) This study uses CFD (computational fluid dynamics) software to compute the mass flow of air driven through a series of BAWT configurations with a simplified turbine model and compares the total power captured by the various configurations. This thesis will show that building shapes can be varied for maximizing power generation by wind augmentation. Wind turbines are only 60% effective which is called the Betz limit and will be derived in subsequent 3

sections. It should be noted that some published studies made the mistake to state that the augmentation increases performance past Betz limit. An augmentation of the wind has only taken place to accelerate velocities through the rotor where the turbine can extract a maximum power factor of 59.3%.

1.1

Ducted Wind Turbines

Ducted wind turbines are categorized as small wind turbines which and are situated inside or at the end of air duct. These turbines are mounted generally on a roof top or integrated into the buildings facade. One end receives ambient air to be accelerated through the duct and directed to the turbine and the exit flow is directed perpendicular to the outside wind. This is done to utilize the separated flow from the leading edge of the turbine unit or the buildings roof. Such setup produces a low pressure region which increases the mass flow and energy potential in the air. A schematic of the flow streamline passing over a building is shown in Figure 1.3. Figure 1.4 is the first model of a ducted wind turbine produced in 1979 by a Glaswegian engineer [9].

Figure 1.3: Schematic sketch of mean flow stream line pattern around a building [9] Building integrated ducts increase air velocity from outside ambient air to the turbine by 20% and provide a 1.7 power increase compared to a bare stand-alone turbine of equal size. Spoilers can also be added to the top of the inlet to increase the performance. Spoilers slightly increase velocities from 30% to 40% at wind incidence angles up to 40 with a power increase to 2.2 to 2.7 [9]. Figure 1.5 shows a 4

Building Augmented Wind Turbines

A building augmented wind turbine (BAWT) system utilizes the venturi effect where the facade of the building is used to create a pressure drop through the system to increase the kinetic energy of the wind at the turbine rotor. Augmentation of the wind using buildings can be done either by integrating and retro-fitting existing buildings with wind turbines or designing buildings aerodynamically. There are different types of BAWT system that are in use today where turbines are mounted on the side or top of a building. This study is focused on BAWT systems where two buildings are acting as a wind augmenter with turbines suspended between the buildings. This type of BAWT is shown in Figure 1.6. Several studies have been performed in the exploration of two-building BAWT systems. Imperial College [5] developed and tested BAWT systems where the building designs were contrived by the aerodynamic performance of the augmenters. This project is known as Wind Energy for the Built Environment (Project WEB) [22] and is shown in Figure 1.7 . The key findings from that research were that optimal augmenter geometries were smooth, rounded and resembled a structural footprint of a `kidney' or `boomerang' shape. It was also found that losses due to flow separation could be reduced by incorporating closely fitted wings or an infill to shroud the turbine and good wind augmentation could be obtained at high angles of incidences up to 75 [5]. Results from the Project WEB are shown in Figure 1.8. Substantial power enhancement up to 2.5 was obtained for low velocities and considerable power enhancement around 1.5 was obtained for speeds greater than 5m/s. Figure 1.8 also shows good power enhancements at 0 , 30 , and 60 incidence and power generation still occurs at a wind incidence angle of 90 . There were some issues raised by Campbell [22] concerning the environmental integration of the BAWT systems. Aerodynamically optimal designs may prove suboptimal economically and the buildings performance may not be energy efficient. Floor plans may not provide practical living space for the occupying residence. Spaces adjacent to the turbines would be less inviting due to concerns over noise, flickering of rotating blades and electromagnetic interference with electronic devices. Campbell suggested the possible solutions to tackle these concerns by placing service areas such as elevators and stairs adjacent to the turbines where these service areas could act as a buffer to the occupied spaces [22].

Betz Limit

The principle of wind turbines is to extract kinetic energy from the prevailing wind and convert it into electricity. A limit to the maximum extractable kinetic energy from the wind by a wind turbine was theorized to be 59.3% by Betz in 1919 [13], and is appropriately termed the Betz limit. Betz formulated the limit using simple one dimensional Bernoulli equation to model incompressible wind flow across the rotor. The assumptions used in the derivation were a constant, uniformly distributed velocity and pressure profile across the turbine's seeping area. Due to this model is one dimensional, tip losses due to rotational effects and viscous dissipation are neglected. 6

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Figure 1.7: Project WEB [22] Referring to Figure 1.9, Betz assumed a stream tube of constant mass flow starting with the undisturbed wind flow defined as V1 , and V2 as the velocity of the wind before and aft of the rotor. Also it was assumed the wind velocity at the turbines rotor is the mean velocity of the wind before and aft of the rotor. Thus the mean wind speed at the rotor is given as V = 1 (V1 + V2 ) 2 (1.1)

The assumption of incompressibility makes the mass flow of the given stream tube to be constant at the rotor inlet and is defined as m  = Ar V (1.2)

where,  is density of air, Ar is the rotor sweeping area, m  is the mass flow through turbine rotor area and V is the mean velocity of air at the rotor. The kinetic energy extracted by the turbine is defined by the change in kinetic energy of the inlet and exit of the stream tube. The Betz limit is defined as the ratio of change in kinetic energy to the undisturbed kinetic energy. Simplified, the power ratio is defined as PR = P 1 = (1 - V R2 )(1 + V R) Po 2 (1.3)

where V R = V2 /V1 is considered the velocity ratio. A graphical representation of Equation 1.3 is presented in Figure 1.10. The inflection point is the Bezt limit and is found by the minimization of the 8

Figure 1.9: Turbine performance [13] differential form of Equation 1.3 to yield the velocity ratio corresponding to the maximum power ratio. Maximum power ratio of 0.593 is the Bezt limit and is represented in Figure 1.10. In reality the Betz limit cannot be achieved with a wind turbine alone due to aerodynamic losses, viscous dissipation, and efficiency losses though mechanical and electrical power converting devices. Such losses arise due to mechanical efficiency losses which reduces the power to 35%­45%. There are energy converters, transmitters, generators and storage devices, the energy extracted drops to 10%­30% of the available potential wind power. However, engineers are using shrouded and ducted turbines to increase the overall mass flow to the turbines increasing the flows kinetic energy. These devices are known as wind augmentation devices because they increase the mass flow and kinetic energy at the rotor plane by utilizing the pressure differential to increase the energy density of the flow.

Background
It is well known that turbulence generated aft of an obstacle can affect the upstream flow characteristics and therefore proper modeling techniques of the turbulence aft of the BAWT systems were utilized. Vortex shedding occurs in a fluid as it passes blunt objects. Alternating low-pressure regions form behind objects which curls the flow into these regions creating a vortex. The vortex low-pressure regions propagate downstream and affect the pressure throughout the solution domain which is known as a pressure cascade. Modeling this pressure casade from vortex shedding will influence the flow characteristics upstream of the BAWT which affects the velocity of the flow passing through the Turbine boundary. This chapter presents the background information for the formulation of methods used to mode vortex shedding in the subsequent sections.

2.1

Flow Between Cylinder Pair

Investigation into flow around paired cylinders had been studied by many researchers like Bearman and Wadcock [7], and Kim and Durbin [17]. Figure 2.1 shows the von Karman street aft of cylinder pairs in low flow Reynolds numbers. The spatial distance separating the cylinder normalized by the cylinder diameter (gap ratio) was the subject of study. They concluded that with gap ratios of 0.5 to 1, the flow is deflected from one body and back to the other in an alternating manner and becomes asymmetric downstream. For gap ratios less than 0.5, the flow around the two cylinders resembled a flow around a single bluff body and produced a single vortex street. The studies also noted that there were multiple modes and Strouhal Numbers for the quasi-stable and alternating behaviours complicating the determination of the vortex shedding period [7, 17]. 13

2.2

Strouhal Number

The von Karman street which forms aft of the BAWT will develop regular periodic oscillation of vortex shedding. Physicist Strouhal described these oscillating frequencies of the vortex street from a circular cylinder as a dimensionless number appropriately named the Strouhal number. The formula for the Strouhal number is shown in Equation 2.1 St = fr L V (2.1)

where fr is the frequency of the vortex shedding, L is the characteristic length of the circular cylinders and V is the velocity of the fluid. For Strouhal numbers high as 1 represent flows dominated by viscosity where slow oscillating motion happens. For Strouhal numbers to the order of 10-4 , high speeds dominates the flow and intermediate number characterise turbulent flow with build up of shedding vortices [23]. Experimental results from Zdravkovich [24] on for flow over a cylinder at a Reynolds number of 106 give Strouhal numbers ranging from 0.18­0.50 and relative frequencies are given in Tabletab::Strouhal numbers. For the purpose of this study a Strouhal number of 0.18 is used to predict the vortex shedding 14

frequency using L = 20m and V = 4.16m/s giving a frequency of 0.0374Hz or and a shed period of 26.7s. Flow simulation accuracy can be achieved by using low order time steps to analyse the vortex structures. Due to the computational resources needed, CFD simulations were performed using 1s time step, one order less than the shedding period.

2.3

Von Karman Street

This study is focused on the augmented power ratio resultant of the BAWT geometry and transient pressure fluctuations created by the resultant von Karman street. The technique used in viewing vortices was given by [2] wherein creating an isoplot of the Q-Criterion at the lowest calculated value. The Qcriterion is a factor used in determining vortex structures in turbulence where flow rotation dominates strain [18]. Using the ANSYS post processing program, an isoplot of the Q-Criterion at the lowest calculated value is created to describe the von Karman street generated downstream as shown in Figure 2.2.

of the shed vortices previously mentioned in Table 2.1. It is shown in Figure 2.2 a periodic von Karman street forms downstream. The bubble formations are vortex rollups which occur after its been shed from the building. There are three vortecies within the designated vortex street clearly defined by the bodies of influence. Von Karman street conforms to the belief that the vortex size does not have considerable change downstream and falls within the expected Strouhal numbers. Fluctuations of the measured augmented power were either small or insignificant at low wind incidence angles. Where at wind incidence angles of 40 and 60 , oscillations in the measured augmented power are evident. Figure 2.3 is a look at a solution oscillating with respect at 60 wind incidence angle.

Figure 2.3: Oscillation of measured power for results of case (Rt = 0, Rx = 0, Ry = 0,  = 60 )

Scrutinizing the solution oscillations in Figure 2.3, there are 8­9 periods in a span of 100s resulting in shedding frequencies within the range of 0.08Hz­0.09Hz. The range of Strouhal numbers corresponding to the shedding frequency range is 0.385Hz­0.433Hz respectively. The measured Strouhal number fall within the range given by Zdrakovich in Table 2.1 thus verifies the solution model of this study. 16

2D Optimized BAWT Footprint

Research of a 2D BAWT was performed by Hans Hamm [14].His model consists of a base 2D geometry where he obtained through a CFD study optimal designs that provides the greatest wind augmentation factors in cases with high and low wind incidence angles. Figure 2.4 is Hamm's illustration of the optimal two dimensional BAWT configuration at low variations in wind incidence angles. The dimensions parameters are nondimensionalized with respect to the base diameter of the BAWT. Hamms [14] research was a study on deriving geometries for best wind augmentation. However a configuration which produces best wind augmentation may not necessarily be the best for power production. The total power produced by wind turbines should also be taking into consideration for BAWT optimization studies. Wind speeds were shown to increase with the reduction of the gap distance but limits the wind turbines rotor diameter to produce small amounts of energy. Maximizing the rotor 17

Statement of Purpose

This research is intended to analyse variations of building facades with respect to three different parameters to determine their effects on power augmentation performance at various wind incidence angles. The BAWT will be modeled from a base two-dimensional building footprint where a controlled extruded three-dimensional building facade is varied under the three parameters of: taper (Rt ), forward lean (Rx ) and spread (Ry ). All BAWT configurations were analysed with wind incidence angle as a factor in the overall performance. The goals of this research are: 1. Determine power variations of different BAWT configuration using three varying parameters such as; taper (Rt ), forward lean (Rx ), and spread (Ry ) 2. Determine increase of power that can be achieved using building facades as augmenters/concentrators 3. Determine the augmentation factors for each configuration 4. Determine the best BAWT configuration for three varying wind regimes 5. Determine the overall BAWT power ratings

Model and Mesh Development
This section discusses the approach used in the development of the models and the mesh. Nineteen BAWT model configurations were created varying in shape using three parabolic parameters with associated constraints and contained within a solution domain. The grids were created to adequately defined the boundary layer along BAWT walls and the resulting turbulent flow structures downstream of the domain.

3.1

Modeling

Modeling was done using Design Modeller from ANSYS Workbench. The dimensional BAWT footprint generated by Hans Hamm is used as for the cross-section of the 3D model. Hamm's geometry was optimized for greatest velocity augmentation at low wind incidence angles which makes it a good starting point for this 3D optimization study. The 3D model was created by extruding and varying a 2D footprint geometry 100m in height. Multiple BAWT configurations were generated by controlling the extrusion process using three parameters to create nineteen BAWT models. Also described is the turbine capture area to simulate the presence of a wind turbine. Lastly the size of the domain will be discussed.

3.1.1

Domain Boundaries

Urban landscapes are densely packed with tall residential and commercial buildings separated by roadways. The separation gaps between adjacent buildings provide corridors for wind to flow through. Since wind directions in urban landscapes are constrained to the orientations of the surrounding buildings, this study assumed low variation of wind incidence angles approaching the BAWT. The base footprint for all contrived 3D BAWT models will be the optimized two-dimensional geometry for low varying wind incidence angles generated by the work of Hans Hamm. The optimal footprint parameters for low wind incidence are listed below: 1. a moderate thickness (bx /Do = 20/20) 19

3.1. MODELING 2. high oblateness (a/Do = 15/20) 3. small gap ratio (g/Do = 3/20)

CHAPTER 3. MODEL AND MESH DEVELOPMENT

The footprint was extruded in the vertical z axis to create Wall boundaries and was controlled using three normalized parameters with respect to the base characteristic diameter o of 20m which was equivalent to Do characteristic diameter of Hans Hamm. The parameters governing the vertical taper (Rt ), forward lean (Rx ), and spread (Ry ) are:

Rt Rx Ry

= = =

1 - t /o xt /(Rt o ) yt /(Rt o )

(3.1) (3.2) (3.3)

Where t is the building diameter at 100m height, o is the buildings base diameter, xt is the forward shift if the building top with respect to the building base and yt is the distance from the symmetry plane to the edge of the building top. Parabolic profiles were chosen to define the vertical profile of the BAWT systems. The parabolic profile was inspired from the velocity profile of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) which will be discussed in subsequent sections. It was thought that a uniform velocity profile normal to the turbine capture area could be achieved in augmentation to provide uniform loading distribution to the turbines. This would require higher velocity augmentation of the low elevations and lower velocity augmentation of the high elevations of the ABL. Prabolic inflection point is constrained to the roof top of the BAWT with respect to their coordinate systems. Constraints are imposed to limit the values of Rx and Ry . These constraints are imposed to maintain a configuration where there is no overhang of the building over the referenced footprint.

where  is a place holder for various cases. Parabolic profile derivation can be found in Appendix A. Figure 3.1 illustrates the use of each parameter. Figures 3.2 and 3.3 represent the geometric variations of the BAWT with respect to each parameter.

Figure 3.1: Variation of 3D BAWT parameters The cases analysed used each building parameter at three different points of interest: minimum (0), medium (0.5) and maximum (1) values for Rx and Ry ; 0, 0.33 and 0.66 for Rt and where subject to four incidence angles of 0 , 20 , 40 , and 60 . The different variations of models totalled to 76 and are shown in Table 3.1 with their respective incidence angles. The velocity profile also defined the starting location of the modeled turbine above a referenced potential wind speed, up at 10m height. The potential wind speed equated to the bottom speed limit of a HAWT at 4.16m/s [1] and modeling turbines under this limit below 10m is not appropriate. The turbine is also constrained at the augmenter throat where the maximum wind augmentation occurs. Thus it is constrained to Equation 3.6 for case x(z ) when 10m  z  100m and is illustrated in Figures 3.4 and 3.5. The domain sizing is critical for the proper analysis of flow characteristics such as pressure to diffuse throughout the domain without any adverse effects from the boundaries of domain. Appropriate domain sizing for flows above Reynolds number 3.5 · 106 are suggested by Grinstein [10]. The Inlet boundary is 21

3.1.2

Bodies of Influence

The fidelity of the solution of the BAWT configurations is dependent on the mesh resolution of the defining von Karman street. The latter occurs from the resulting shedding and propagation of vortex structures downstream from bluff bodies. Grid resolution must define these turbulent structures well enough to accurately model the pressure cascade of the von Karman street. Tapered cylinders produces varying vortex structures which are described to be a linear function of taper by Piccirrillo and Van Atta [11, 12, 21]. Two bodies of influence will refine the mesh to resolve the varying shed vortex scales. The size of the body of influence to define the von Karman street from a cylinder for Reynolds numbers above 5.5 · 105 was suggested to be three times the cylinder diameter by Grinstein [10]. A coarse body of influence was defined by a sphere of diameter 120m extending its centroid from the Ground at the center of the BAWT extending to 100m in height, and spanning the length of the Domain downstream 400m. The fine body of influence is defined by a sphere of 80m also extending its centroid from the Ground at the center of the BAWT extending 100m in height and spanning 250m downstream. Figure 3.9 shows the Bodies of Influence defining the von Karman vortex street. 24

Meshing

CFD requires the computational domain to be discretized into elements for the solver to apply the discrete RANS fluid equations at each element interface. ANSYS MESH was used to discretize the solution domain around the various BAWT geometries. An unstructured grid system was chosen for its suitability to model complex turbulent flow structures within the von Karman street [16]. Modeling of the von Karman street relies on accurate modeling of the adverse pressure gradients of vortex shedding and requires adequate boundary layer resolution on the Wall boundaries. A near-wall model was used to approximate transition to laminar boundary layer where boundary layer accuracy can be reduced to y + values from 1­10. The boundary layer was defined at the first prism height, y of 0.001m with 25 inflated prism layers at an expansion ratio of 1.2.

3.3

Inflation Layers

Inflation layers were used to capture the velocity gradient of the boundary layer developed by shear friction occurring from a no-slip wall condition of the domain Walls. Also it is critical to capture the laminar separation with appropriate mesh refinement to capture the separation bubble from the shed vortex. To resolve flow calculations to a degree of accuracy, FLUENT uses an enhanced wall treatment for the selected k ­ shear stress transport (SST) model. This wall treatment uses a near-wall approximation method predicts the boundary's viscous and transition layers. This reduces the need to extensively refine the mesh near a Wall boundary to capture the boundary layer profile, and also reduces computational cost. Figure 3.10 shows inflation layers surrounding a cross section of the buildings facade, y+ = u yp µ (3.7)

where u =

at the surface wall, yp is the displacement of the first adjacent nodal point P from the wall and  is the density of the fluid. For the k ­ (SST) turbulence model, Fluent recomends when using the enhanced wall treatment to obtain a y + value of the first adjacent nodes to be within 1  y +  5. FLUENT approximates the first inflation layer height with Equation 3.8,  y = Ly + 80Re(-13/14) (3.8)

where y + is the targeted value of the first adjacent node, L is the structural cord length and Re is 29

A y +  10 was used to define the first non-dimensional off-wall spacing. The reference y + of 5 was not used for the purpose of reducing mesh size and computational time. The first node spacing off the wall with respect to a Reynolds number of 5.5 · 106 is calculated to be,

The number of inflation layers was selected in FLUENT MESH operation to define the resultant inflation around the buildings. The final inflation layer thickness of 0.1m was assumed to generate a cell height to length ratio of 10 to provide good solution transition from the inflation layers to the domain elements sized at 1m. Inflation layer height was increased by the standard growth factor of 1.2, thus the number of inflation layers is calculated by Equation 3.10,

Thus the inflation applied to the building in this study uses 25 layers, with a starting inflation height of 0.001m and a growth factor of 1.2. Figure 3.11 shows a plot of the y + values up along the building height for transient solutions. The y + values in Figure 3.11 are shown to be within the reasonable range which FLUENT determines to be good for near-wall approximations to take effect. 31

A single 5m inflated prism layer called a `sponge layer' shown in Figure 3.12 was used.

Grid and Time Step Study

The accuracy a numerical simulation has is dependent on the grid resolution. Through parametric studies of grid resolutions, insight is gained into when the physics modeled becomes independent of grid spacing and does not change with increased grid refinement. Steady state simulations are conducted for this preliminary grid independence study. This study conducted tests using four grids ranging in density of 0.66 · 106 ­3.9 · 106 elements. The power within the wind at the Turbine plane was the monitored parameter in determining solution convergence. This study looks into the concentrator affects of a BAWT under time averaged conditions. Transient simulations are used to perform time step simulations where the solution is found for a series of time-step for a specified time interval. Just like the grid independence study, a time-step study is performed with the derived grid from the grid independence study. The three time-step sizes used in this study were 0.1s, 1s and 10s. Lastly a verification of the resultant time-step was used in conjunction with the parametric grid study under a transient simulation. This study will verify mesh independence with the resultant time-step.

3.6.1

Steady State Grid Convergence

The grid study used four meshes with all the same controls applied to them but are different in their scaling parameters. This parameter allows all elements to be adjusted in scale, varying in the x, y , and z directions. The initial mesh was scaled by factors of 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 1.4 where a scaling less than 1 represents a stretch factor, and a factor above 1 is shrinkage factor. Each scaled mesh was tested until convergence 34

of the augmented power of the BAWT was reached. The resultant augmented powers plotted with respective to their mesh element densities. A Richardson extrapotation was performed using Matlab where the asymtote of the converging power solution is found. The extrapolated solution was then used as base point in determining the accuracy of the solution to the respective mesh sizings. Figure 3.15 shows the comparative study of the four scaled meshes where the solutions appear to describe an asymptotic convergence of the augmented power to an extrapolated power of 346.9kW.

Figure 3.15: Steady state mesh convergence Resultant deviations of the augmented power ratios compared to the extrapolated power ratio from the cases are shown in Table 3.3. Using a steady state solution it is shown the finest mesh has a deviation of 5.45% from the extrapolated power which is too high to conclude the solution of the discretized domain to be grid dependent. A solution is considered grid independent if there less than 1% deviation between the measured power and the extrapolated value. The steady state augmented powers are noted to be high and unrealistic. This is due from the assumed steady state solution and the values were approximated with no transient fluctuations affecting turbulence in the flow resulting in the over evaluations of scalar variables. Thus a transient grid study 37

was conducted to resolve this issue.

3.7

Time Step Study

Conversely, just like the grid convergence a study in time step size was done such that the transient turbulent behaviour and von Karman street is modeled and resulting turbine back pressure is simulated. A time-marching or dual-time scheme method used by ANSYS FLUENT which finds a converged steady state solution at the respective flow time and then advances the solution by the time step and converges another steady state solution for that time step, so on so forth. Eddies are formed the flow through viscous shearing stemming from the flows surface friction form the ground and buildings. Eddies formed by the buildings separate from the surface, known as vortex shedding and migrate downstream with the flow. Length and time scales are needed to be resolved to obtain adequate turbulent characteristics within the flows discretized domain. Thus a time step study was performed using the previous resolved mesh number 4 of the grid study. The effects of time step size where performed using three time step sizes of 0.1s, 1s and 10s. The convergence of power ratio was used to determine the appropriate time step. It should be noted the case of time step of 0.1s had not completed to a convergence value less than 0.5% of its mean extrapolated power ratio in over a hundred processing hours. Due to the vast amount of time needed to complete a full study using 0.1s time step, it was not considered. Conversely, solution convergence was not obtained using a 10s time step and fluctuations of the measured power ration varied 10%, thus is inappropriate for this study. The case using 1s time step resolved to a converged value and the solution remained within a 0.5% deviation range for several hundred time step. Logically the 1s time step seemed most appropriate to begin with since the average element size to the discretized solution is of 1m and which are of similar size in scale. The processing time for solution convergence is shown in Table 3.4. Within the maximum alloted processing time Sharcnet provided was 100h. Using a time step of 0.1s and a grid size of 3.9 · 106 elements, the processing did not finish (DNF). For the larger time step of 10s, the solution did not converge (DNC). The convergence time for the cases of one second time steps was around 24h of processing time with the use of 8 way parallel processing on Sharcnet's Guppy system. Guppy uses Inlet Xeon cores with 2.67 GHz and 24.0 GB RAM and cores are connected by a QDR InfiniBand. A sample read out from 38

Grid-Time Step Study

Simulations were tested for a length of time until results showed a steady mean of transient augmented power. The solution was considered converged when the change in power was less than 0.5% from the extrapolated mean over a few hundred time steps. Evaluating the mean power from t = 0 to time step t = ti , defined in Equation 3.11 as Pi =

(3.11)

The assumed 1s time step from the previous time step study was used to conduct transient mesh independence study of the previous scaled meshes. Figure 3.16 shows convergence values of the mean augmented power ratio of the four meshes with respect to node density. Deviations of the resultant grid-time convergence study are shown in Table 3.5. It can be seen that mesh 4 deviated from the extrapolated result by 0.66%. For case tested for mesh and time convergence, no taper was applied to the BAWT but was analyzed with a wind incidence angle of 0 . It is assumed smaller vortex will be shed in tapered cases, thus the finer mesh should be used to capture the smaller vortex scales. Modeling the smaller turbulent scales more accurately will lead to better pressure fluctuation results aft of the turbine to better predict augmented power at the rotor. Therefore mesh 4 will be used for the purpose of this study.

This section contains discussions of the approaches to the conditions for the solution boundaries, simulation parameters and the result criteria. Specified solution parameters for turbulent modeling were used to simulate the von Karman street. The analysis of power at the Turbine was used to determine solution convergence of the mean transient to a specified accuracy.

4.1

Boundary Conditions

Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). ABL is the naturally occurring velocity profile developed when air passes over Earths terrain. Viscous forces become dominant near the terrain where shear forces resist fluid momentum until zero velocity is reached at the surface. Zero velocity at the surface is considered a no slip condition. A commonly used model to define the velocity profile of ABL is the logarithmic law (Log-Law). A Log-Law defining the boundary layer over a flat plate was derived by Prandtl was also found to be valid to define the ABL near the Earths surface [15]. Velocity profile from a referenced height of 60m is used to calculate the velocity profile for any reference wind speed. ABL defined by Holmes [15] was simplified with defining a surface roughness, zo of 0.03m and represented as Equation 4.1[19] ln u(z) = 1.31up ln
z zo 60 zo

(4.1)

where up is the potential wind speed 10m above ground and z is the elevation height. The Log-Law profile was used with the velocity inlet condition to define the ABL normal to the Inlet boundary with a 10% turbulence intensity suggested by ANSYS when the inlet turbulent characteristics are unknown. Figure 4.1 shows the ABL velocity vectors and stream lines along a segment of the domain. A gauge pressure of 0Pa far field was chosen for pressure at the Outlet condition. Symmetry conditions were imposed on the Sides and Top boundaries of the domain to artificially 41

simulate a greater domain space. Flow variables are allowed to develop along these symmetry boundaries where the normal gradients of the flow variables are equated to zero. Normal gradients however are not zero at the Walls and Ground boundaries. A no-slip condition is used for the two boundaries where the surface roughness zo of 0.03m is defined for the Ground to simulate terrain. The Walls are assumed to be smooth [22] thus zero surface roughness was used. The Turbine boundary was defined with a porous jump condition where a pressure drop was applied to simulate the presence of a turbine. A simplified Navier-Stokes equation for momentum derived in Appendix C was used to define the pressure drop across the Turbine in Equation C.2 as 1 P = -C2 u2 m 2 (4.2)

where  is the density of the fluid, C2 is the momentum loss term corresponding to the pressure loss coefficient defined by Hans Hamm as 0.4 [14], u is the velocity magnitude normal to the cell face, and m is the thickness of the porous jump.

4.2

Solution Parameters

The solver used for this CFD analysis is FLUENT (ANSYS Inc.). This solver was chosen because of its reputation for solving both high and low Reynolds flows and around bluff bodies and the ability to obtain good boundary layer flow characteristics in all flow regimes. A density-based implicit solver was used where only Navier-Stokes equations are solved simultaneously using algebraic multi-grid (AMG) solver. A second-order upwind scheme recommended by ANSYS for accuracy in solving the discretized solution domain using the finite volume method was used. The shear stress transport (SST) k -  model was chosen over traditional k - model for its accuracy in solving adverse pressure gradients induced by wall bounded turbulent structures [2]. Mentor developed the SST which incorporates the qualities of models k ­ and k­ by using a blend factor to activate the k ­ to calculate shear stress at low Reynolds number within the flow boundary layers and at far field where negligible shear stresses occur the k­ model is activated.

deviation from the extrapolated mean of the augmented power for several hundred seconds. The extrapolated mean augmented power was calculated using built in Richardson extrapolation function within Matlab to calculate the convergence value of mean augmented power. Plots of the solution convergence is shown in Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 is the associated error with respect to the converged value.

Various BAWT configurations produced oscillations of the augmented power at high incidence angles and wide spread. Pressure fluctuations formed from vortex shedding occurring at the Turbine boundary.

Where n, is the normal vector of the sweeping area and 1 = u + V 2 + gz 2

Simplifications are made by neglecting internal energy and the hydrostatic terms. Due to the incompressibility of the fluid and lack of heat transfer the internal energy is constant, the fluid is gravitational the potential energy remains constant thus they can be negated reducing the equation to the kinetic energy of the fluid. = 1 2 V 2 (4.6)

The first term of the 4.9 is dropped because the Turbine only varies in the y -direction. Thus change in Turbine area becomes A = y (z )z Equation 4.10 can be substituted back into Equation 4.7 and simplifications are made 47 (4.10)

Results
An analysis of the data obtained from this study is synthesised and presented in various sections to illustrate of the purpose of this study. ANSYS FLUENT software was used to perform transient simulations of 76 BAWT cases where their wind augmentation performance was measured with respect to four wind incidence angles. The BAWT performances were measured by various criteria of augmentation of both velocity and power, and the ratio of augmented power to unaugmented power. Also along with analysing their power ratings using three different wind regimes with equivalent frequencies, power rating was obtained from the sum of the product of the augmented power and the frequency of the wind incidence angle. Figures 5.1 5.2 shows all data relevant to the results sections. Only BAWT configuration with Rx values at 0.5 are presented. This was done because change in results varied minutely with the change in Rx for all cases.

5.1

Velocity Augmentation

One of the purposes of this study was to determine the velocity augmentation factor the BAWT configurations have on the imposing wind. The augmented velocity is the average normal velocity at the Turbine boundary. The unaugmented wind speed was taken as the average normal velocity of the ABL through Turbine boundary. Augmentation factors were calculated by normalizing the augmented velocity with the unaugmented velocity. The BAWT velocity augmentation factors were obtained for each of the various wind incidence angles and are shown in Figure 5.3. It can be seen from Figure 5.3 that augmentation factors for all BAWT configurations are at their highest at zero wind incidence angle and a gradual decrease occurs with increasing angles. Looking at the results for zero wind incidence angles, it is noted there the highest value of 1.3 is obtained for the case with no taper, Rt is 0. Velocity augmentation factors are shown to decrease by 1.5% and 4.6% with the increasing in taper from 0.33 and 0.66 respectively while and keeping an equivalent turbine capture area with a spread factor of 0. 49

5.2. AUGMENTED POWER

The spread factor Ry is shown to have a negative effect on velocity augmentation factors for all cases. At zero incidence angle and using spread factor of 1 and 0.5 for cases of taper Rt 0.33 and 0.66 respectively, augmentation factors decreased from their 0 spread configuration by 10.2% and 11.3% and respectively. These results correlate to the law of continuity well, which states the incompressible flow must increase velocity through the BAWT gap region to maintain mass flow conservation. The velocity is also related to the pressure through the system where greater pressure differentials create higher velocities. Figure 5.3 also illustrates the angles at which the BAWT configurations produce no velocity augmentation. Augmentation factors below 1 depict a decrease in performance values comparative to the free stream ABL. The BAWT configuration with taper 0.66 and spread of 1 is shown to prove no augmentation for incidence at 20 and poor augmentation for angles greater than 20 . Positive augmentation remains for at higher angles with decrease in spread factor, and the decrease in taper. The BAWT with 0 taper and 0 spread factors maintained to generate the highest augmentation factor for all incidence angles.

5.2

Augmented Power

This section analyses the augmented power delivered to the turbine capture area for all BAWT configurations with a comparison to the power in the ABL at the Turbine boundary.

5.2.1

Total Power

The total power within the flow at the Turbine boundary was obtained from the integral power developed normal to the Turbine boundary. Total power was obtained for each BAWT and was graphed in correlation to the four wind incidence angles shown in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4 shows there is a clear case when taper is 0.66 with spread factor of 1 generates the greatest energy of 255.7kW at the Turbine at 0 wind incidence. It is interesting to note from the previous section, this case provided the least velocity augmentation but outperforms in power generation. Moreover, the tapered cases with 0 spread factors which produce the highest wind augmentation factors result in generating the least power. This suggests the study of wind power generation is sensitive to changes in the capture area of turbines. For the cases with spread factor of 0 with equivalent capture areas of 540m2 , the total augmented power of the three cases for taper of 0, 0.33 and 0.66 are 106.2kW, 100.3kW, and 91kW respectively with a difference of 10.6%­11.7% . Changes in capture area produce wide degree of augmented power for the BAWT configurations. When spread factor was increased from 0 to 0.5, the Turbine boundary area increased 82.7% and 165.5% for tapers 0.33 and 0.66 respectively. This increased area augments the total power by 108.2% and 95.8% for the tapered cases of 0.33 and 0.66 respectively. The configuration with the lowest power production at o wind incidence angle is taper ratio of 0.66 with spread factor of 0. This resulted from the lack of velocity augmentation through the BAWT where the flow does not accelerate comparably to the cases with increases in taper ratio and 0 spread factor. 53

5.3. POWER RATING

Looking at Figure 5.4 from the best configuration to operate at 60 is the configuration with 0 taper. It outperforms configurations with taper at maximum spread factor of 1 by 20.1% and 38.8% for tapers of 0.33 and 0.66 respectively. Power values decrease with increasing wind incidence angle. This is an adequate result with correlations to the venturi effect with respect to incidence where venturi factor decreased as a result of the lack of low pressures aft of the BAWT system. The case where taper is 0.33 at max spread factor of 1 surpasses the total power of cases with taper 0.66 and 0 is at a wind incidence angle of 30 ­40 . The difference in total power is 6.75kW, a difference of 5.6% and 15.6% at 40 and 60 wind incidence angles respectively. The two cases are surpassed by case of 0 taper between 50 ­60 . The measured powers at wind incidence angles of 60 are; 41.4kW, 47.9kW, and 57.5kW, with a difference of 38.8% and 20% with respect to the cases when taper of 0.33 and 0.66, both spread factors at 1 respectively. The critical factor controlling power production is the building spread which maximize turbine capture area, and higher wind augmentation factor plays a minimal role in the overall total power of a BAWT.

5.2.2

Power Augmentation Factor

Power augmentation factor determines how much power augmentation the specific BAWT configurations have in comparision to the ABL. The power augmentation factor is the ratio of the measured augmented total power to the total power from an unaugmented ABL. Power augmentation factors were measured for each BAWT configuration at each of the wind incidence angles and are plotted in Figure 5.5. An average drop in power augmentation factor of 0.5 occurs when spread increases from 0 to 0.5 and an average drop of 0.2 occurs from 0.5 to 1. Power augmentation factor of 1 occurs just below 50 for spread factor of 0 and occurs at 30 and 20 with Ry = 0.5 and Ry = 1 respectively. A factor of 1 shows when a BAWT system produces no increase in total power compared to the power available in the ABL.

5.3

Power Rating

This study looked into defining the power rating of BAWT configurations varying wind regimes. Power rating is defined as the sum products of the augmented power and corresponding wind frequencies of the wind regime. Wind regimes are frequency of the measured wind directions based on the statistical averaged for a particular location. Frequency of wind regimes are location dependent and any specified frequencies would be arbitrary. For this study three even frequency regime distributions are analysed where their frequencies of the wind incidence angles are equivalent and the regimes sum total of the frequencies equate 100%. Also a case study with a wind regime based on referenced statistical yearly averages at a referenced location is studied for a more realistic analysis of BAWT power rating. 55

Even Frequency Regimes

This section is sub divided into three sub sections each pertaining to the analysis of each wind regime given in Table 5.1. The power ratings are plotted with respect to their turbine capture area. High Regime The high wind regime incorporates all wind incidence angles tested ranging from 0 ­60 . Since the study contained a symmetry plain through the BAWT at 0 , the negative reflective angles are taken into account creating a wind azimuth of ±60 . The frequencies of the seven incidence angle are assumed to be equal value of 14.3% to sum 100%. The rated power for the BAWT system for a high wind regime is shown in Figure 5.6. Figure 5.6 depicts the power ratings for each BAWT configuration in the high regime with respect to the turbine capture area. Figure 5.6 shows when spread factor is constant at 0, the power rating is highest for cases of 0 taper and produces a power rating of 84kW. The other ratings vary 12.9% and 38.2% for tapers of 0.33 and 0.66 respectively from the case of 0 taper. It is interesting to note there are two cases of similar power ratings. The cases of tapered 0.33 and 0.5 spread factor is rated at 105.9kW and case of 0.66 tapper and spread factor of 0.5 is rated at 108.5kW with a difference of 2.4%. The greater power rating developed by wind augmentation is counter balanced by a greater capture area. For the case of 0.33 taper and spread factor of 1 the power rating is 22% higher than case of 0.66 taper at its maximum spread factor of 1 with equivalent Turbine areas. The velocity augmentation becomes the defining factor for energy capture rating. Medium Regime The medium wind regime incorporates the wind incidence angles ranging from 0 ­40 . Symmetry plane previously mentioned used at 0 bisecting the BAWT generating a wind azimuth of ±40 . Equal frequencies for each wind incidence angle are 20% summing to 100%. Figure 5.7 depicts the power rating the BAWT configurations in the medium regime. Equivalent trends to that of the high regime are produced for the medium regime were the results appear as scaled high regime results. For a constant spread factor of 0 of all tapered cases, the highest power rating of 95.1kW is from the case with no taper, with an 11.3% and 29.6% difference in power ratings from cases when taper is 0.33 and 0.66 respectively. 57

The two same cases are in close proximity also within the medium regime. Their values of 130.3kW and 138.8kW for the cases of taper at 0.33 with spread factor of 0.5 and case of taper 0.66% with spread factory of 0.5 respectively. The difference of these values is 6.4%. When the case of 0.33 taper has capture area equal to case with taper 0.66, a difference of 20% is shown. The highest energy captures obtained from all tapers were generated at their max spread factors where turbine capture area is maximized. These values are given in Table 5.3 were the differences compared to the case of 0 taper are 75.1% and 100% from tapers of 0.33 and 0.66 respectively. Low Regime The low wind regime incorporates the wind incidence angles ranging from 0 ­20 with a symmetry plane at 0 generates a wind azimuth of ±20 . Equal frequencies of each wind incidence angle are 33.3% summing to 100%. Figure 5.8 depicts the power rating of each BAWT configuration for a low regime.

grouping of configurations that is noted within Figure 5.8. The values for of these configurations are shown in Table 5.3. The differences of cases of 0.33 taper with spread factor of 0.5 and 0.66 taper at spread factor 0.5 is 12.5%. When the 0.33 taper case increases to spread factor of 1, it then out performs the 0.66 taper with an equal turbine capture area by 20.5%. Power rating is maximized for each taper case when maximum spread factor and turbine capture area is reached. The power rating increases 84.5% and 122.4% from tapered cases 0.33 and 0.66 with respect to the case of 0 taper.

5.3.2

Wind Regime Case Study

The previous power ratings made use of an even frequency distribution across the evaluated wind regimes which generates an over evaluates the power rating. A more realistic approach is taking in the section where measured values of yearly averaged wind characteristics are refferenced from the Toronto Island Airport, Toronto, Ontario. The wind regime's frequency was obtained by from a wind rose plot and used to calculate the power rating. Finally power ratings for all the BAWT configurations analysed are made and compared. A wind rose plot is essential in determining the appropriate site for wind turbines and BAWT systems. It states three main characteristics of the wind engineers need to determine if a location is suitable in harvesting wind. The three characteristics are: speed, direction and frequency. A wind rose plot from the Toronto Island Airport was select for this study for its comparable ABL to the simulated ABL. Winds are coming off the water where the surface roughness is low and close to that of the simulated 0.03m surface roughness. Figure 5.9 is the wind rose plot of the Toronto Island Airport. It can be seen from 5.10 the dominant wind direction is of West South West direction. Thus the BAWT system was oriented to face into that direction and have the BAWT's plane of symmetry directed West South West. Figure 5.10 illustrates the orientation of the BAWT system and it's encompassing wind azimuth of ±60 . The sectors for the wind rose plot are sepparated by 22.5 and it was assumed the sectors are close enough to the simulated wind sectors of 20 . The wind incidence angles and their frequencies are tabulated in Table 5.2. Similarly to the previous section, power rating was defined as the sum products of the augmented power and corresponding wind frequencies of the wind regime. It is noted the sum of the frequency for the regime within the BAWT azimuth totals 42.2%, hence a lower power rating will incur. The power ratings for the BAWT configurations are presented in Figure 5.11. Figure 5.11 depicts the power ratings for each BAWT configuration Toronto Island Airport wind regime with respect to the turbine capture area. Figure 5.11 shows when spread factor is constant at 61

The other ratings vary 13% and 34.8% for tapers of 0.33 and 0.66 respectively from the case of 0 taper. The cases of tapered 0.33 and 0.5 spread factor is rated at 45.2kW and case of 0.66 tapper and spread factor of 0.5 is rated at 44.6kW with a difference of 1.3%. The greater power rating developed by wind augmentation is counter balanced by a greater capture area. For the case of 0.33 taper and spread factor of 1 the power rating is 25.8% higher than case of 0.66 taper at spread factor of 0.5 with equivalent Turbine areas. The velocity augmentation becomes the defining factor for energy capture rating. Comparing the rating for the taperred cases at their maximum spread factor and maximum turbine capture area, there is little increase in power rating. There is a 9.6% difference in power rating between the two configurations suggesting no real gains occur in power rating.

Conclusion
It should be noted the simulated turbines was simplified using a porous jump boundary condition with a one-dimensional pressure drop approximation. Turbine turbulent factors such as rotational effects and tip losses were not taken into account within the simplified porous jump bounday. The key aim of this study was to find a BAWT geometry which provides greatest velocity augmentation, total augmented power and overall power rating with respect to different wind regimes. This thesis utilized an optimized two dimensional BAWT footprint for low wind incidence angles derived from the work of Hans Hamm [14] where parabolic parameter definitions were imposed on the three dimensional extruding of the BAWT configuration. Also important in this investigation was the modeling of ABL to obtain realistic flow characteristics. Proper modeling of the von Karman street developed the pressure cascade to influence the pressure upstream and ultimately the BAWT augmented power at the turbine. In summary: 1. Augmentation factor correlates with continuity law and venturi effect 2. The BAWT configuration with no taper produced highest augmentation 3. The BAWT with greatest spread factor and taper produced lowest augmentation 4. Turbine capture area is the primary factor in generating best captured power 5. Velocity augmentation is a secondary factor in producing best capture power 6. Best configuration may lay between a taper ratio of 0.33 and 0.66 at max spread of 1

Future analysis would be to model BAWT systems and include other building obstructions for the wind. Perhaps obstructions can act as a diverter or channel to provide consistent and high wind regime 65

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSION

frequencies to BAWT. A realistic urban ABL maybe modeled for the study which may generate different BAWT profiles for greatest power augmentation. Furthe study can also be made in varying the original gap size for greater range of turbine capture area. A trade of study of the gap area between the buildings and the turbine sweeping area and the number of turbines used can be done. Direct modelling of rotating turbines can generate the rotational effects and tip losses which occur in real flows across turbines. The cross-section of the BAWT system can also be varied with height. The variation of the 2D parameters set by Hamm can be varied as a function of height and potentially a new parameter of twist may be incorporated. The design may also incorporate a bi-directional flow where the turbines can counter rotate and receive wind from the other end and generate power. Lastly an optimization routine can be utilized in directing the researcher in the direction of the optimal BAWT configurations according to the imposed various constraints.

Appendix A

Parabolic BAWT Profile Formulation
It was mentioned in the Methodology section the BAWT profile follows a parabolic profile for each of the three pamameters. This section derrives the the parabolic profile as a function of the buildings height. The base parabolic equation is defined as P (z ) = az 2 + bz + c (A.1)

where a, b and c are constants to the parabolic equation. It was assumed there to be no change in the profile at the building roof 100m high, thus differentiating Equation A.1 and substituting the defined variables we get

P (z )

=

2az + b

P (z ) = 0 0

@ z = 100 = 2a(100) + b -200a

b =

P (z ) = az 2 - 200bz + c

Aslo, the parabolic profile is 0 at the ground when z = 0m. Substituting the known variables into Equation A.2 67

Equation A.4 is the derived parabolic profile defining the BAWT taper and forward lean parameters. Spread factor has an added constant at the end of A.4 which defines the initial gap of 3m set by the refferenced model of Hans Hamm. Thus the parabolic function for spread factor is given as P (z ) = z (200 - z ) +3 500 (A.5)

Bodies of Influence
Bodies of influence are used to control element sizing at specified locations within the control volume without modeling an internal body. Two bodies of influence were used to define the vortex street with varying element sizes of influence. The sizes were varied from finest located up the center of the of BAWT system with a gradual coarsening in the bodies of influent as they move further downstream in the domain. A body of influence of 120m diameter encapsulated the BAWT system and was extended downstream to the outlet area to capture the von Karman street. Figure B.1 shows the bodies of influence encapsulating the BAWT system as domed structures which are stretched downstream in the von Karman street. The length of the medium body of influence was defined by the assumption vortex would dissipate enough kinetic energy and extend turbulent length scale to be captured in the coarser body of influence after three shedding periods. The frequency of shedding was determined from the Strouhal numbers defined by Zdrakovich for flows over cylinders at flow Reynolds nuber 1 · 106 defined in Table B.1. The distance a vortex propagates from a body after three periods is found by multiplying the inverse of frequency and the potential wind speed define in Equation B.1.

APPENDIX B. BODIES OF INFLUENCE bers. Zdravkovich defines Strouhal numbers to fall within the range from 0.18­0.50 which is dependent on the turbulence model chosen for analysis. Since there is a range of Strouhal numbers it was assumed any number may appear within this study. Therefore the largest propagation distance was used which corresponds to the lowest shedding frequency from a Strouhal number of 0.18. Figures B.2 and B.3 show the turbulent von Karman street formed behind the BAWT systems. They depict vortex bubbles to remain within the defined bodies of influence for the modelling of the upstream pressure cascade.

Figure B.2: Q-Criterion Iso Surface with Turbulent kinetic energy variations (Rt = 0.33, Rx = 0.5, Ry = 0.5 and  = 0 Also in the two Figures B.2 and B.3, three separation bubbles are visibily defined within the 330m length of the Fine Body of Influence. Thus it can be said the k ­ (SST) model, near-wall modeling and vortex shedding produces a pressure cascade well enough for the purpose of this study.

Porous Jump
Turbines were modeled using the porous jump boundary condition at the Turbine boundary. The NavierStokes equations with the addition of momentum source terms where used to model the porous media. The Navier-Stokes equations with momentum sources terms are given below in Cartesian coordinates in Equation C.1 P = - µ 1  + C2 u2 m  2 (C.1)

µ is the fluid viscosity,  is the dynamic viscosity,  is the permeability of the porous media. Two source terms account for the viscous losses and inertial loss when the fluid passes through the porous jump Turbine boundary condition. The first term is called the Darcy term which is the instantaneous discharge rate of a fluid through a porous medium. The simplification does not incorporate the effects and flow characteristics of the vortex shedding created by the rotating blades, thus omitting three dimensional wake and tip effects. The simplified modeled turbine consists of no porous media therefore no viscous losses incur thus the Darcy term is dropped and porous jump is defined by Equation C.2. 1 P = -C2 u2 m 2 (C.2)

To maintain consistency with the work from Hans Hamm [14] his arbitrary pressure coefficient C2 = 0.4 was used for the pressure loss coefficient of the porous jump with a unit length of m = 1. Figure C.1 illustrates the pressure drop though the mid section of the BAWT along the x-axis at a height of 60m. The pressure drop accros the turbine was measured from the difference of the measured pressures at the Tubine capture area and 1m downstream. The pressure difference of the cell values are calculated to be P = -11.49Pa. Verification of the pressure drop found at the porous section is based on the fluid velocity entering the porous jump boundary and was measured to be 6.71m/s. Using equation C.2 the pressure drop 73
