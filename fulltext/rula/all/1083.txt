AGORA 2012: The Return to the Traditional Markeplace
Master of Architecture Degree 2011 Winnie Lam Ho Suen Master of Architecture Ryerson University

Abstract Market forms such as shopping malls and department stores have been cloned endlessly in both rural and urban areas in many countries as a successful retail model. Despite the fairly homogeneous architectural expression and internalized (isolated) environment of new market forms (cut off from the city at large), the mass production of generic markets are seen favourably, since they are cost effective and offer the high dollar-per-square-footage that developers seek and that favours a global consumer economy. Therefore, the more traditional public markets that were once an expression the local life and culture are now being replacing by the "McDonaldized" (Rizter, 2006 page 123) marketplaces. They all have a similar architectural form, type and style that have little or no linkage to the locale and, in addition, are private zones. Since the 1970s, the intensity of construction of such generic market places has been slowly overriding the authentic identity of market architecture in many regions. In order to distinguish and express the unique architectural developments and the difference in local lifestyles of different regions, it is important to maintain local identity of building that houses "historically stable programs" (Leong, 2011, p. 138) such as Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 1

local market. It is also crucial to keep the marketplace public in nature where people can socialize with greater freedom. This project intends to re- capture the local identity in a specific urban marketplace as a test of how contemporary design can maintain, revitalize and reinterpret the essence of the local architecture. The site is a typical residential- commercial neighbourhood known as Li-Nong in Shanghai. It is a row house neighbourhood built in 1924 in the heart of the city. The deterioration of buildings and limited access into the neighbourhood has contributed to the decline of businesses in the neighbourhood's commercial strip. This project attempts to revitalize the historical laneway commercial neighbourhood and make it into a pedestrianized and inviting neighbourhood where locals can still have a shopping experience that is informed by the 1924 Shanghai-nese architecture.

Acknowledgements
First of all, I would like to say thank you to my supervisor, Dr. June Komisar who is a very knowledgeable professor and has been incredibly supportive throughout the making of this thesis project. I am so grateful to work with June as she has always supported my interest in retail architecture. June has helped me an incredible amount. June's aspiration and dedication inspired me to keep pushing myself to develop a strong thesis project. She was very informative and critical about the ideas that I have brought up to the table during the meeting sessions. But most importantly, she gave me the freedom to try new ideas and encouraged me think in different perspectives. I have learnt a lot about the evolution of retail architecture, and the social and public space as the two inseparable components. Thank you June for all your hard work! It was a fun experience to work with you. Thanks for sparing you 6:30pm to 7:30pm so that we can meet after my working hours. Thanks for your time and consideration! The second person that I would also like to thank is Dr. Daniel Chieh from Shanghai. Dr. Chieh help me to circulate the surveys "Shopping in Shanghai" in his class. As a pilot research on this topic, the data collected during the exploration period was very useful. It covered a wide demographics, income range and detailed comments about how Shanghai-nese thinks about shopping. It really helps me a lot in understand the shopping trend in Shanghai. Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family for their support and understanding. Thank you MSC Fund for the scholarship. Thank you mom for listening to my thesis findings all the time that I know you may not be interested in it but you did it anyway! Thank you everyone!

Chapter 1- The Generic Market

Markets today are expressed in different forms. From the Oxford English Dictionary, Market is defined as: 1- a regular gathering of people for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other commodities 2- an open space or covered building where vendors convene to sell their goods. 3- an area or arena in which commercial dealings are conducted. In this sense, a market can be as basic as a street market selling produce, as simple as a corner store where shoppers walk to pick up one or two items. It can also be as tangible as shopping mall that houses hundreds of stores, or as intangible as online shopping which does not require any physical store. All kinds of markets have emerged in our societies at different times for different reasons. They come in all sizes and express various architectural styles. Among all, the shopping mall is the most popular shopping facility built around the world today while the department store comes second. Both market types originate from the American and European culture and societies. However, most of the recently built shopping malls are, in fact, located in the economy-rising countries including China, India, the Philippines, Dubai and Brazil. In 2011, 12 out of 20 world's largest shopping malls (Figure 1a) are located in Brazil, Middle East and in Asian Pacific countries. These countries cloned these western market forms to their land because they see such buildings as successful economic precedents from the developed countries. In the rising countries' point of view, these alien market types (Figure 1b & 1c) are seen as exotic marketplaces that attract populace to stay in the shopping realm. The longer period they stay in these commodified spaces, the higher chance for more sales. As a Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 11

result, the adoption of western market types creates a leapfrogging scenario in the marketplace evolution of rising countries. In other words, there is no linkage between old markets and the new market forms; as one is created though heritage and local culture and the other is borrowed from another culture. Because of the globalization of the American and European market models, old markets all over the world with their local histories and regional characters have been taken over slowly by the internationally recognized market typology ­ the shopping mall. New shopping facilities are built like fast food as suggested by George Ritzer in his essay (Ritzer, 2006). "McDonaldized" is the word to describe the concern for economic and mass production efficiency and thus, it disregards the local needs and activities, heritage, and regional architectural style. Seeing the authentic local shopping environment is diminishing in the generic market and its homogeneous shopping experience (Figure 1d), is there a way preserve the authenticity or capture the essence of old market in a region?

Figure 1.e &1.f shows malls built in the international style create a homogenous shopping experience and a restrictive social environment that has no relationship to the country it resides within. There is no cultural identity expressed in these spaces. People can easily lose their sense of place when they are inside the mall. It is no different to be in a mall in Istanbul and in a mall in Brazil. In addition, people are constantly under surveillance and are restricted in their range of activities because it is a private controlled space. Consequently, people behave the same way in all the homogeneous shopping malls.

Chapter 2 ­ What was a Market?

"Shopping has had to invent new techniques to make itself accessible and appealing to the public while the market place and the individual shop have endured as forms that have followed the development of civilization, other forms have taken shape to reflect the changing relationship of humans to material goods and to the city." (Leong, 2001)

In early civilization, the market was a place for people to showcase, buy and sell their agricultural and crafted goods. It has been integrated into human settlements since the earliest civilization. Our trading format has evolved from selling on a woven mat on the ground to simply clicking the mouse on a vinyl mat at home. Market forms and types have grown and diverged though mutation and reinventions to adopt to every little change and need in our society ­ the ever changing economy, the advancing technology, rising trends and pop culture, as well as the improvement in living standard.

2.1 ­ The Market as an Expression of a Region
Like an iconic structure in a city, authentic markets can exhibits the essence of a city or region through the architectural expression of market forms. Distinctive markets forms can easily inform the shoppers about the location, history and culture of a place. This spans from medieval town centres in England to the Moroccan Bazaar. These are discussed below.

Figure 2.1 a - Farmers' boats docked at the pier and form the floating market in Thailand ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1278355&page=2 )

A very different market type is the mobile floating market in Thailand (Figure 2.1a). The fertile soil in Thailand was connected by networks rivers, streams and artificial cannels constructed 150 years ago. Villages flourished along the waterways. Since then, boats became the major means of transportation to other villages. Farmers used boats as movable "market stalls" to transport their produce from village to village for trading. Boats park along the wooden dock structure and form a series of floating stalls that become a form of market. Farmers still practice this type of mobile market in some cities today. Another example of a mobile market is the Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 17

mobile market on bikes, motorcycles and carts (Figure 2.1b) in Shanghai. Mobile markets usually occur in the afternoon. They can be found in laneway intersections and on the streets temporarily at the outskirts of the Shanghai City. Fresh produce, fish, accessories and street food are available in these markets. There is no anchor of any structure in this type of market. When vehicles have to pass through the intersection, these on-the-wheel-market stalls will move aside and come back together when the vehicle passes. Such markets are cheap and easy to set up with absolutely no order or controls.

Figure 2.1 b - Mobile market in Shanghai (http://shanghaistreetstories.com/?category_name=street-stories&paged=10 )

Subject to each unique regional context, markets were established in a variety of formats. Traditional market facilities are expressed with locally distinct architectural styles and configurations as well as building techniques and materials. They were built in accordance to the availability of local materials, considering local climate, geography, culture and heritage. Figure 2.1c shows the Canterbury Town Centre and the Burlington Arcade from the early 1900s in England. These show variations in just one country ­ the UK.

Figure 2.1 c ­ Two different market forms in England: Town Centre (left) and Arcade (right)

These two markets address shopping in different ways. The shop fronts in the town centre are facing outward to the public space and pedestrian street, while the shops in the Burlington Arcade face inward to form internal covered streets with a high ceiling and skylight. It demonstrates there can be different variations of local market forms and architectural style even within the same country. They often possess a unique local shopping environment that is familiar to residents and speak of local traditions of the recent or distant past. An "Upstairs" market is an interesting market expression originating in Hong Kong (Figure 2.1d). This emerged when Hong Kong was experiencing the economic downturns and financial crises in 2003 when the SARS virus broke out in Hong Kong. Businesses at the time were under pressure because of the high rent in a suddenly shrinking economy. It was too expensive for people, especially the younger generation, to start a business with a shop and window front at the street level. The image below was taken in Causeway Bay, a popular local shopping district. Young investors gave up the traditional idea of having shop fronts on the ground level. Instead, they transformed the second and third floor of the old residential building with stores, and turned the units into boutiques, cafés, salons, pet

Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011

19

stores, studios, designer stores and art galleries much more cheaply than street ­ level stores would have been.

Figure 2.1 d - "Upstairs" shops in Hong Kong. The blue box shows the entry point to the "Upstairs" market above the street shops. (http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/finance/20090827/00204_014.html)

The "upstairs" retail space is usually long and linear with tight corridor spaces and stair width which punctures through several old residential buildings (Figure 2.1e).

Figure 2.1 e - Minimal interior to address the new shopping environment (http://www.check1check.hk/ads/%E5%B0%96%E6%B2%99%E5%92%800solo-13f%E6%A8%93%E4%B8%8A%E8%88%96%E6%8B%9B%E7%A7%9F)

"Upstairs" markets do not have display windows on grade, nor attractive building facades to attract shoppers into the shops. They are not housed by any new architecture, but inhabit within existing residential buildings. The beauty of the hidden markets is the mysterious shopping environment that provokes shopper's curiosity and desire to explore. Shops in the "upstairs" market are not organized like the shopping mall, categorized by price range or brands. They are totally random. The business hours of shops also vary. The entrance to the "upstairs" market is always small and hidden (Figure 2.1d & 2.1f). The huge variety of specialty shops and the cheaper price make them the popular local shopping places. Ones can find cheap clothing and high fashion in the same market. These markets are usually known through the word of mouth and online websites. Hence the "upstairs" market is a real local market today that responds to the local economy without the sanitized controlled order of a modern mall. This low cost market type is still continuously expanding as the new creative nest to nurture young artists and business in Hong Kong (Figure 2.1g).

The Moroccan bazaar (Figure 2.1h & 2.1j) was developed in parallel with medieval town halls in the 13th century. What makes the Moroccan bazaar market distinctive is the "covered streets" with shops in various sizes lined up along the central street. Fabrics, grass mat and Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 22

wooden structure are used to protect the pathways from direct penetration of sunlight. Shops are elevated one step above the road with trading counters across the frontage. The stone flooring and white mud walls, wooden structure and trading counters, and roof made out of hay, altogether create a warm and simple market atmosphere (Figure 2.1j).

Figure 2k shows the classic street market, Ye-Shi in China. It literally means "night city" where shops and restaurants open until eleven or mid night. Hawkers in carts, simple booths and tables will join the business on the street. Snack booths, handmade art and crafts stands can be found everywhere along the street. The street always packed with locals and visitors for mid-night snacks, chatting, shopping watching puppet shows and listening to local people singing on the street.

Older markets were true reflection of human life. They were built with particular configurations and architectural styles which were tailored for the local environment and people's daily needs. Therefore they naturally attract local people to utilize and congregate in the market space on daily bases. In other words, old marketplace speaks about the local way of life, as well as how local socialize and interact. While the current generic shopping facilities are designed and built to associate with other programs that are not necessarily attached to the locals' daily life. They are purposed to artificially attract more human activities and interactions. Ancient markets are expressions of different regions. Their architectural forms and the way they were built exhibit the character of a region and the most down ­to-earth daily life of locals. Some of these markets have successfully evolved and adapted to the constantly changing regional conditions at specific period of time. Like the floating market in Thailand and the "upstairs" shops in Hong Kong are interesting examples of locally adapted marketplaces that are also economically viable.

2.2 ­ Market as a Spectacle of Life

"Basic trade stalls in market have grown into the various shopping formats we have today... They affect our environment and become the place we identify with, serving as backgrounds to our social and leisure lives. They often form the memories we grow up with and look back as our pleasant parts of our lives." (Coleman, 2006)

We shaped markets and markets shaped us. Historically, the market was a fundamental built form to accommodate trading activities. With a growing population in a city, it implied a potential increase in the catchment population of that area. In other words, more people needed to shop and required more space for social interaction. Responding to this situation, market architecture expanded its functions and complexity in terms of programming, organization and the building form to account for the change. Take the Greek Agora as an example. Figure 2.2a is a map of the ancient agora of Athens in the 5th century BC.

FIgure 2.2 a ­ Master Plan of the Greek Agora, Athens, 5 BC Market is the only area that overlaps with all other programs in the agora including temples (place to worship), civic buildings (place to rule/govern), and recreation (place to play and compete). (Background image: http://www.planetware.com/map/agora-map-gr-agor.htm )

The agora was situated along the way to the Acropolis, a major site for worshipping. It had an open square surrounded by a number of building types including the civic buildings, Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 27

markets, temples, and recreational facilities where all kinds of human daily events took place.The blue solid line on the map shows the boundary of the market buildings (the stoa, Figure 2.2b) which had occupied a majority of the space in the agora.

FIgure 2.2 b - Stoa, market building in the agora (http://www.stoa.org.uk/pages/stoa.html )

Stoa was a covered, semi-open structure built out of stone. Goods are laid out on mats and stalls temporarily to share space with other activities- such as voting, meeting, debates, sports and parades. There were several stoa in the agora of Athens. Some of them simple market buildings, some are jointed with other programs. Like the stoa on the south side of the site wrapped around a gymnasium (the orange building on the south) and jointed with the concert theatre to its north, so that games and performance were blended into the shopping realm. Residential and hotels are separated from the agora, creating a clear division between live, work and entertainment at that period of time. Civic and military buildings (buildings in green) are located on the west side of the agora while the temples are loosely dispersed into the open space, mixing the religious activities into the shopping area indirectly.

The third example to show market as a reflection of local life is the night market at the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Figure 2.2d).

The difference in geographic location, culture, local life, resources and context create two markets that are completely different architectural style, form and operation. The Indian bazaar operates during daytime. It is a market targets to the local residence which sells mainly produce and dye. Its architecture comprise of simple gable roof wood building, with a series of large and simple bamboo structure supporting the nylon canopy that covers one third of the pathway. While the market in Brazil consists of several rows of small easy-to-assemble steel booth modules spaced out separately along the shoreline. The booths are put away during daytime with people occupying the beach. In the evening, the beach turns into a popular night markets for both locals and tourists to hand out. Food, drinks, music extravaganzas, art and crafts, ones can find all kinds of night life in this market. From these two examples, it is obvious that local markets inherit their own regional characteristics- the society and the local life. Its presence (as in its architectural form) is a narrative of the life style in the region.

2.3 ­ Western Market Evolution and Variations

Arcades, department stores, shopping malls, and life style centers are different expressions of market in the evolution of commercial architecture with more than two thousand years of time span. Appendix A shows the emergence of major shopping facilities in recent history. The increasing population, complex networking and densification of city fabric especially in the earlier developing countries, there is a constant shifting of market form in terms of architectural style, organization, concept, functions and the relationship to the context. Appendix B illustrates the changing relationship between shopping space, the circulation pattern and designated social spaces within a dominant shopping typology at a specific period of time. There are many reasons that influence the western shopping to change and diverge rapidly since the industrial revolution period. Some mechanical and technological inventions like the introduction of cast iron structure and efficient construction method that increase the floor area and volume of shopping interior. The wide adoption of huge window glazing and skylight promotes the use of natural lighting which saves operation costs. It also allows the window as a display showcase to attract customers. During the world war period in the early 1900s, the societal and cultural change of a region has greatly influenced the European and American contemporary shopping forms. In America, the rise of Fordism and the encouragement of private car ownership subsequently after the mass production of machinery in the first World War and Second World War. The increasing automobile culture became a major consideration for new shopping facility design. In the reconstruction of developed countries, many utopian urban planning ideas were proposed and influenced the post war town planning in the western countries. Some examples Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 31

are like the satellite city, Bedford in London United Kingdom and American suburban neighbourhood, Redburn, New Jersey America, was advocated by urban planner Ebenezer Howard who proposed the Garden Cities in 1900. Similar scenario for Europe and America, in America, the baby boom, and the American Dream appeared after the WWII. There was a huge increase in population, the need for residential spaces and amenities drastically. The extended travelling distance further promoted the automobile culture and the extensive construction of infrastructure. To satisfy the growing country and increasing number of consumers, market facilities have to go big and fancy to capture as much potential customers as possible to induce consumerism and materialism and to thrive the economy. Now, city development takes place inside and outside the city boundary. Therefore the evolution of shopping facility has also diverged into "in-town" shopping facilities and "out-of-town" shopping facilities as Coleman categorised in his book. Figure 2.3a-2.3d are different types of market expression in the American and European countries between early and mid 1900s.

The above market expressions were responses to the building construction technology, the automobile culture, Fordism, post-war baby boom and the rise of satellite cities in western countries after WWII. These facilities have successfully promoted consumerism and have thriven the western economy. There shopping is a symbols of economic success. Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 33

2.4 ­ What is a Market today?
In the essay, "...And Then There Was Shopping" , Leong suggested that materialism and the market economy continuously shape our surroundings and us, thus shopping is an important element that is firmly attached to our space, buildings, cities, activities and lives. It is a marketplace, a city and a world. He explains that shopping is strongly expressed in the form of markets in a city and in our heritage. It is an activity even more popular than citizen's obligations and human needs like attending high school, going to church and visit a clinic or hospital. However, shopping is absolutely sensitive as it depends on external factors like economy, trends and even weather. The attendance can fluctuate dramatically in monthly or even in hourly cycle (Leong, 2001). In this sense, shopping as an unstable, vulnerable and most short lived activity. Therefore shopping facility developers have to seek ways to secure the amount of guaranteed visitors. One of the most important shopping facility design strategy today is to combine shopping with other historically stable programs in a city such as civic buildings, and housing. Figure 2.4a ­ 2.4h show shopping has merged with other programs in the city.

With the global economic downturn, people seek alternatives to the mall to shop cheaply. Rather than shopping in physical shopping facilities, people turns to internet shopping which offers cheaper price and with more choices. Figure 2.4i shows increase in online retail in US from 2000 to 2009. At the same time, an increase in percentage on the vacancy rate of shopping centre in US has also increased drastically (Figure 2.4j). This shows that the reliance on physical shopping space has decreased. One device to keep people in the physical mall, rather than the virtual marketplace is attaching shopping to other aspects of our daily life. This has successfully redirected people into the commodified environment. However the expansion of shopping into other programs creates gigantic mixed use complexes that are losing their novelty.

Rising countries like China also see an increase in online retail users (Figure 2.4k). A survey on Shopping in Shanghai (Appendix C) was conducted in 2010 summer shows only 38% of people find shopping mall complexes to be their favourite shopping place. 62% of people prefer to be in public and local marketplaces like the pedestrian shopping streets, or repurposed scenic areas with shops, flea markets, laneway markets and arcades. 85% of people spend less than 10 hours each week on shopping, while 15% of people spend 10 to 15 hours per week on shopping. That said, 90% of people stay in the market realm to dine, to meet friends, to exercise and to watch movies apart from shopping. The survey in Appendix C has pointed out that locals enjoy being in the local markets more than monolithic shopping complexes and that the majority of the locals socialize in marketplaces.

In other words, the market today is still a part of our daily lives but les and less for shopping. People visit the physical marketplace for other reasons. Therefore the marketplace with other programs is becoming a place for daily and social activities rather than shopping. (Figure 2.4l)

Chapter 3 ­ Strategic Design for a Market Facility Today

"The shopping mall prolongs the exchange by offering a plethora of possible purchases that continuously accelerate the creation of new bonds between objects and consumer. By extending the period of `just looking' the imaginative prelude to buying, the mall encourage `cognitive acquisition' as shopper mentally acquire commodities by familiarizing themselves with a commdity's actual and imagined qualities." (Crawford, 1992)

Designers have to create new market facilities that can expand on use, designers also have to capture people's time and interest in the realm of shopping to increase the chance for sales. Over the time, mechanical inventions have greatly improved the comfort level in a shopping environment. Several design strategies have also proven to create an `interesting' and `exciting' shopping atmosphere with high rate, including a certain success with attracting consumers. Margaret Crawford suggests all these design strategies involve a process called "indirect commodification" (Ibid, 1992) which non-saleable objects, images and activities that share no similarity are purposely placed in the shopping realm and they can mutually supporting each other. The following chapter will talk about this type of intervention and how the three retail strategies ­ the adjacent attractions, the fake authenticity, as well as the disneyfication (AlSayyad, 2007), have turned markets today into a whole new dome of pleasure where the shopping facility becomes a separated city with no sense of place and heritage.

3.1 ­ The Mechanical Invention
M. Crawford points out shopping facilities require a comfortable and safe shopping environment to capture the shoppers' time and interest. Such `happily regulated vision of pleasure' (Crawford, 1992) can be implemented by the different mechanical inventions like the air conditioning, escalators, skylights and more. The use of air conditioning allows air to penetrate deep into the shopping space and embraces the customers in a protected, comfortable environment. The constantly regulated temperature, humidity, and brightness create a mini-world within the market all year round. Second, the enclosure of shopping with surveillance enables a secure environment for both shoppers and sellers. The escalator and elevator are efficient means to connect shoppers to multiple floors effortlessly (Figure 3.1a & 3.1b).

\
Figure 3.1 a Figure 3.1 b

Skylight enables natural light to flood into the deep interiors with no cost. Advancement in building construction technique enables the stacking of multiple, easily accessible planes to expand retail square footage as much as possible within a confined building foot print. Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 43

3.2 ­ Fake Authenticity & Disneyfication
The fake authenticity is the placing of unrelated image of one cultural heritage into another region in a totally different context. This results in such stage-set construction as the almost identical the Venetian Casino, hotel and shopping mall complex built both in Las Vegas, U.S. and Macau, China (Figure 3.2a- 3.2d).

The two buildings are expressed identically from exterior to interior. Both of them are imitating the buildings in Venice (Figure 3.2e) despite the fact that one is located in a desert area and the other is an island with a Portuguese colonial background. By throwing in a random historical reference and reconstruction of structures from another country and time into a totally irrelevant context perhaps can create a great `exotic destination' for the locals to enjoy. However there is no real architectural value given by the structure to the local region, its culture or traditions.

Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011

Disneyfication is a term used by Alsayyad in his essay, Consuming Heritage or the End of Tradition. The term is a way of labelling the phenomenon described above where the original character of a real place or event is stripped and then repacked in a `sanitized way' (AlSayyad, 2007) or with other borrowed authenticity. Either way, they do not involve novelty of the region and relationship to the context. West Edmonton Mall is an example that has literally Disneyfied its interior to look like Disneyland Main Street. (Figure 3.2f)

Figure 3.2 f ­ West Edmonton Mall, Canada

(http://www.flickr.com/photos/32631586@N07/3060347142/ ) The purpose of Disneyfication is to create a surreal shopping environment for the locals to enjoy as an escape from reality. However such marketplaces have no relationship between the building and its context.

3.3 ­ Adjacent Attractions
Adjacent Attraction is the insertion of other programs into the shopping realm as a secondary attraction. During the period of arcade and department from 1800 to 1950 (Appendix B), shopping space was translated as pure commoditized space which did not have space for social or gathering purpose. In 1950, America first introduced a first-generation shopping mall (Figure 3.3a) which incorporates social space in form of open courtyard and large atrium that housed escalators and benches.

Figure 3.3 a & b ­ Seating area in the atrium of the first shopping mall in America, the Southdale Centre, Minnesota, contrasted with the ice rink in City Plaza in Hong Kong, with ever-increasing space devoted to adjacent attractions. ( http://urbanneighbourhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/southdale-old.jpg )

Seeing the insertion of adjacent attractions in shopping malls has successfully captured the shoppers to stay longer and stimulate the American economy and consumerism, developers started to reproduce hundreds of malls in America using different adjacent attractions and ways to address the shopping environment and mutate the malls in different fashion. From simple fountain, benches, planters and food court, now we started to incorporate unrelated programs Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 48

into the shopping realm to further absorb bigger crowd to prolong consumers' stay for longer periods of time. The close proximity of these joint programs also makes people stay in the shopping realm involuntarily. Figure 3.3b illustrates how adjacent attractions induce shopping.

Figure 3.3 c ­ Placing adjacent attractions within the market gives people the flexibility to from other activities to shopping easily.

Richard Sennett supports and explains another rationale behind the placement of dissimilar attraction and objects into the shopping realm are to temporarily suspend the use value of object from its context temporarily. He points out that because there is no relationship between the scene or attraction and the commodity, the appearance of the two entities together becomes unexpected and therefore stimulating the shoppers' interests towards the commodities (Sennett, 1976). In particular, different form of entertainment like movie theatre and theme parks have nicely fitted into today's shopping facilities (Figure 3.3c & d). Market has evolved into a complex that is built bigger than ever before because of all these extra programs. Also because Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 49

of mix of different programs, the definition of space becomes ambiguous. It is hard to distinguish between social, collective, recreational, public and private space.

Chapter 4 ­ Critiques in McDonalization of Shopping Facilities Today

Shopping malls have become the most popular market type in both western counties and across the globe, but especially in America. George Rizter call this repetitive building form and landscape feature the `generica' which is the short form for "generic America" (Rizter, 2007). He claims that the shopping mall has been replicated worldwide because it is easy to mass produce with low cost and high profitability as supposed to the one-of-a-kind market. In Ritzer's essay, Can Globalized Commercial Architecture by Anything but Highly McDonalized?, he describes the production of commercial architecture as McDonaldization (Rizter, 2007) which means it is highly efficient but homogeneous in appearance. The cloning of the generic shopping facilities is already everywhere and will only continue to grow in numbers. Despite the globalization of "generica" such as shopping malls and department stores carry no regional architectural character and their existence is inevitable, architects should continue to advil the regional market evolution and acknowledge the local architecture and heritage as potential marketplace design and development in the future.

4.1 ­ Suburban and Rural Market
In North America, people live further apart from each other outside the city. The population density in rural and suburban is very low compare to the urban area. The rural land value is therefore lower than the city. This allows the suburban and rural markets to build cheap on huge plots of land and shorter building height. Because of the comparatively low population density, rural shopping facilities also need to attract people from great distance to maintain a similar catchment population as the urban market. In North America, automobiles and massive infrastructure are the crucial means to connect the residents in suburban area and the marketplaces. Huge parking lots became an essential component in all out-of-city marketplace design. (Figure 4.1a, b)

Figure 4.1 a - (Left) First Shopping Mall in America - Southdale Centre, Edina, Minnesota ( http://www.retrothing.com/2008/12/the-worlds-firs.html ) Figure 4.1 b ­ (Right) Shopping Mall built in 2000 ­ Flatiron Crossing, Broomsfield, Colorado ( http://maps.google.com )

54

As suburban and rural areas used to be open farmland or wilderness areas, with little protection for the historic landscape and few design restrictions, makes the resulting building do not relate to the regional culture or landscape. Thus it makes sense that the suburban and exurban shopping malls lack contextual or regional architectural expression. For instance, generic first generation suburban shopping malls (Figure 4.1 a) and big box shopping centres (Figure 4.1c) in the North American are two types that illustrate the homogeneous and alien expression in building design.

Figure 4.1 c - Big Box Shopping Centre (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wal-Mart_in_Madison_Heights.jpg )

Now architects have started to design-build rural and suburban entertainment - shopping facilities like Flatiron Crossing outside Bloomfield (Figure 4.1d - f) with environmental consciousness which respond to climate and energy savings. However, presently, in North America, access to such malls in only by car. The dominance of suburban and rural shopping

Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011

55

facilities have turned themselves into legitimate places for social, economic and cultural interaction without contextual and heritage reference.

4.2 - Urban Market
Urban Markets are built in the city with higher population density than the rural area. It is usually built on a smaller piece of land because of the high property values and it serves a large catchment population in closer proximity. Therefore verticality and spread are the key words for urban market. Department stores, "main streets" with individual stores, vertical shopping malls and market buildings, arcades and street markets are common urban market types in the North America and Europe. In particular, the older market types like the street shops and arcade tend to be built with more regional architectural characters. They are easy to recognize and thus gives a sense of place to the populace. One advantage of building markets in a city is the markets can easily make reference to the surrounding. The market in a compact city is naturally close to other programs like the residential, retail, recreation facilities and government buildings. Hence it also makes sense to create mixed-use markets in an urban context to save space and facilitate population growth and efficiency of the city. John Jerde is an architect specialized in designing shopping facilities and entertainment mix use complexes that respond to local context. A majority of his work is dealing with the shopping experience in the urban area. Take the shopping mall complex, Namba Parks in Osaka as an example. It is a shopping mall and office complex located at the heart of the Osaka City where the old baseball stadium is used to be. It is also the first train stop to enter the city from the Kansai Airport. John Jerde sees this shopping mall as the gateway to the city and its identity should well represent the city of Osaka. In order to keep that essence of recreation and sooth Osaka's dense urban condition, John Jerde conceived this shopping mall as a large "natural" landscape where he created a shopping facility that resembles a canyon with a series of roof garden with abundant hard and soft landscape combined (Figure 4.2a ­ c). It is now one Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 57

of the popular parks in Osaka. This is one way to relate modern condition of Japan, however, not its heritage architecture. Can contemporary projects both address the contemporary city and the traditional landscape?

Chapter 5 ­ MARKETS, PUBLIC SPACE AND HERITAGE

Noticing the changing nature of today's contemporary marketplace, I realized that modern marketplaces, including the high street, department stores, shopping malls, and online shopping have gradually reshaped our concept of marketplace, and the nature of public space. People still visit the meg- sized shopping facilities discussed in earlier chapters, although they can shop online. However, a majority of people go to shopping areas for leisure activities including socializing with others. Therefore we see a trend of contemporary marketplaces augmented by multi-entertainment programs like incorporating cinemas and daily destinations like offices and schools, so that people cannot avoid socializing in such private commodified spaces. It is clear that people today go to physical markets for reasons besides shopping. This leads to a number of questions: Are other forms of marketplace where we can foster social life in public realm rather than private commodified spaces? Can both contempoprary lifestyles and heritage be addressed when creating an urban market, while also maintaining a non- privatized public realm? I would like to use this revitalization proposal to argue that we can promote social life in public spaces by looking at the local traditional market forms for architectural inspiration as they were successful models for holding spectacles everyday activities and even shopping in local life in the past. By reusing and modifying local market architecture, it allows local markets to evolve into new forms of shopping and socializing in accordance to local conditions and heritage.

5.1 ­ The Attempts in Preserving Heritage
Xintiandi is a car-free, shopping, eating and entertainment destination in Shanghai, China (Figure 5.1 a). Located in the French Concession, the site was previously a colonial neighbourhood occupied by a series of adjoining residential and commercial mixed use houses called Shikumen (Figure 5.1 b).

Figure 5.1 a - Xintiandi today (http://www.rihanyu.com/upfiles/content/9-2010721144627124.jpg ) Figure 5.1 b - Xintiandi site in 1930s (http://lh5.ggpht.com/_e0MjFR6we5g/TZLnHfbROQI/AAAAAAAABRE/hWHLatGXweA/s512/DSCF3011.JPG )

Shikumen is a unique colonial architecture which mixed the English row house exterior with a Chinese interior as well as different ornamentation from various architectural traditions . These old residential and market buildings are now threatened due to rapid urbanization and demolition in Shanghai. These neighbourhoods are disappearing quickly and replacing by highrise buildings. Architects Ben Wood and Ma Qingyun notice the importance to keep this one-ofa-kind colonial architecture in Shanghai as a cultural heritage. Therefore they created Xintiandi Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 61

as a re-imagination of the old Streetscape that reminds the locals of their old days with colonial architectural detailing. It also allows foreigners to experience the traditional Shanghai shopping environment (Figure 5.1 c).

Figure 5.1 c - Laneway in Li-nong, Xintiandi (http://lh3.ggpht.com/_e0MjFR6we5g/TZLnFsCm2_I/AAAAAAAABRA/et1GitP5LVI/s512/DSCF3010.JPG )

"Xintiandi is a place where older people find it nostalgic, younger people find it trendy, foreigners find it Chinese, and Chinese people find it foreign. It is a place where everybody finds something of his or her own, Xintian di belongs not only to Shanghai, but to China and the world." (Shikumen Museum, Xintiandi) The quote above points out that the architects, Ben Wood and Ma Qingyun, want to show the life the Shanghai-nese used to have- a place for locals to hang out apart from the dazzling modernized Shanghai through the Xintiandi project. "That's true Chineseness," Ma Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 62

Qingyun says. "Everything is in constant mutation; nothing is set as fixity. We don't follow any spatial models. We don't care about the look of the building so much so everybody still lives in Shanghai in ugly buildings. We care about how convenient life is." (Lim, 2006). Waterhouse is another reinterpretation of how Shikumen buildings are seen today in the modernized and urbanized Shanghai. (Figure 5.1 d-f) The Waterhouse was orginally a warehouse located in Shanghai's historic Shi-Liu-Pu dockyard district. It is now being renovated into a boutique hotel with an event warehouse. Chinese architects, Neri & Hu Research and Design Office conceived the idea of inverting the interior and exterior spaces and creating a disorienting yet refreshing spatial experience for guests by stripping the ordinary Shikumen style warehouse. This exposes the untreated old concrete structure and wooden doors which gives a sense of the modern Chinese aesthetic while maintaining the old building. The installation of large clear windows and private terraces enable the public to glimpse into the private rooms while the private rooms also invite guests to look out into the public area. A new Corten steels extension is also added on the existing roof to create more hotel rooms, further mixing the new and the old.

5.2 ­ The History of Shanghai & Laneway Retail Market
The Birth of Shanghai-nese Style Architecture
Brief History of Shanghai starting from the Opium War in early 1840s After China's lost in the Opium War in 1842, the British army occupied Shanghai and the banks of the Yangtze River. They cut off the financial resources from the South to the capital and forced the Qing (the last dynasty of China's empirical rule) Government to sign the Nanjing Treaty on 29 August 1842. Apart from the external ports established in the South China region, Britain asked for other external port establishments in the Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Xiamen. Apart from that, Britain also took advantage of selling of Opium in China, for there it was a legal activity. But the most influential "benefit" to China is the "renting" of land to Britain for their traders to settle in Shanghai. Within the "rented" area, Britain had an option to rule with British law. This treaty started the inflow of western culture and architecture. French was the next to sign the treaty with China. Shanghai became an open trade port under the rule of China and the establishment of British and French concession in 1842. China was defenceless after the loss of the Opium War and series of rebellions from the locals before the First World War. Many western counties forced China to sign many unfair treaties. Spain, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, in total, thirteen countries arrived in Shanghai to take business advantage and set up their own embassies to claim their ports and territories in Shanghai. Therefore the city was divided into many small colonial districts where foreign countries built their neighbourhoods that blended Western architectural style with Chinese architecture. Because of the social unrest and rebellions by locals at the same time as the Opium war, a lot of Chinese sought protection from the colonial power and moved into the colonial neighbourhoods. It gave rise to the fusion of culture and architecture between the Chinese and eleven other nations between 1850 and 1950 (Figure 5a). Shanghai gradually Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 66

developed into an international port (Figure 5b, c) just like her sister's city Hong Kong, with a mix of unique western-eastern architecture.

5.3 ­ Shikumen & Li-Nong
Shikumen is composed of series of adjoining houses called Shikumen and narrow alleys. Shikumen is literally translated as "Stone-Gate" (Figure 5.3a). Such gates are used as the entrance to the Shikumen neighbourhood (know as Li-Nong) and the entrance to each living unit. Shikumen is a typical Shanghai-nese live-and-work place during the colonial period constructed by the eleven nations during that colonized Shanghai for trading purposes.

Figure 5.3 a ­ the "Stone Gate"

The look and internal layout of Shikumen vary slightly in different parts of a Li-Nong. They are generally divided into three types- Shikumen at the perimeter of a Li-Nong, Shikumen with private gardens, and Shikumen inside a Li-Nong (Figure 5.1b-d). Shikumen is a fusion of Western and Chinese architecture. Typical shikumen is shaped and organized like British row house. However distinct Chinese building components and details are also found in a majority of Li-Nong. Like the light well and courtyard at the entrance to the living room, stepped wall (fire-proof wall) that separate each house, the Chinese style interior. (Figure 5.1 e, f)

Figure 5.3 f - Typical Shikumen interior.

Shikumen has evolved into different forms during the colonial period to accommodate the demographics in Shanghai. From garden villas for the upper class, to semi-detached houses for the middle class, to row house and the apartment style Shikumen for the lower class, all of them are recognised as Shikumen because they all have the "stone gate" entrance.

Figure 5.3 g ­ Colonial Li-Nong

Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011

71

The organization of a Li-Nong which was developed by western colonialists, adopted the grid systems with a main lane going through the site and sub-lane going across the site (Figure 5.3h). This form enables Li-Nong to be a protected neighbourhood. Shikumen that face the public streets always wraps around the Li-Nong like a fort with only a few openings into the neighbourhood.

Figure 5.3 h- (Left) Organized Circulation in a Colonial Li-Nong Development. Figure 5.3 i ­ (Right) Organic circulation in a Local Li-Nong Development.

The Li-Nong built by the Shanghai locals is less organized (Figure 5.3i). It also has a main lane to support major traffic through the site, but its sub lanes are branched out asymmetrically because the local Li-Nong was developed through time to reconcile the changing population, while the colonial Li-Nong was planned prior to construction. Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 72

5.4 - Characteristics of Laneway Market
People living in Li-Nong make use of the ground floor as retail stores and second and third floors as liveable space. Hence they created many live-work communities since the early 1900s. The marketplace in Shikumen has two parts ­ the market streets that are facing outward to the public streets, and the laneway market inside the neighbourhood (Figure 5.2a&b). From food store, to tailor shop, to hair salon, to restaurant, this marketplace houses all kinds of retail stores which make it a self sufficient neighbourhood. Since it is easy to access all kinds of retail in close proximity, locals mostly travel on foot or by bike.

Chapter 6 ­ The Return to Traditional Marketplace Using a Local School as a Catalyst

With reference to Arata Isozaki's opinion on "emphasizing architecture as a cultural practice beyond its mere functional determination" (Lee & Baumeister, 2007), I think architecture shall respond to its context and region. In other words, the expression of the building and space shall recall its vernacular or historical essence, which generate the collective memories of the locals and provide authentic experience for the non-locals. This idea is manifest through this thesis project. A school in Huaihai Fang, a traditional Shanghai Li-Nong, is chosen to be remodelled to introduce a new public market space and shared amenities for the surrounding neighbourhoods. Using the new school as a catalyst to induce more social activities in the neighbourhood, it ultimately aims to reactivate and bring back the activities that exist in a traditional laneway market. In all, this project is to acknowledge the fact that people go to physical market spaces for reasons other than shopping.

6.1 - Huaihai Fang: The Hidden Laneway Market and Community
Huaihai Fang is a colonial live-work neighbourhood located in the French concession in Shanghai. It was built by the Belgian Church in 1924. Huaihai Fang is located along a historically siginificant shopping street called Huaihai Road. Even today, Huaihai Road is still one of the major shopping streets in Shanghai (Figure 6.1a).

Figure 6.1 a ­ Location of Huaihai Fang, Shanghai

Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011

75

Huaihai Fang is a traditional Li-Nong with typical row house style Shikumen and laneway retails. It was a popular live-work community among the Chinese writers and scientists in the early and mid 1900s. In 2004, the Shanghai Government decided to preserve the central portion of Huaihai Fang as a heritage and historically significant area. However the peripheral shikumen and the laneway market in Huaihai Fang were excluded from Shanghai Government protection and were left unprotected. As a result, these unprotected buildings continue to deteriorate. The poor living condition and retail environment in the south east portion of Huaihai Fang are not attracting people to visit and socialize in that area. The current condition is also hindering the retail businesses in the neighbourhood (Figure 6.1b & 6.1c).

Figure 6.1 b ­ The unpreserved heritage and local market verses the newly developed area in the same neighbourhood.

Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011

76

Figure 6.1 c ­ Vacant stores on Nan Chang Road with very little traffic during daytime.

The deterioration of shikumen and shops along the east and south side of the neighbourhood turned people away from this historically successful laneway marketplace. The laneway market is hidden from the outside and only limited traffic brings people into the neighbourhood. The result is, the current amount of visitors and residents in Huaihai Fang is so small that it is not enough to support these laneway shops. Thus many businesses have been closed down. The traditional laneway marketplace in Huaihai Fang is disappearing (Figure 6.1d).

Figure 6.1 d - Six out of nineteen stores in the outer laneway market is currently vacant.

Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011

77

Another factor that discourages people to visit the laneway market is the limited access into Huaihai Fang. Huaihai Fang was built like a fort that has only two entrances into the neighbourhood. One of them is located on Huaihai Road which is also an entrance to the underground parking garage for the surround malls and commercial buildings. Another entrance is the main gatehouse that is located on the south east corner of Huaihai Fang. The permeability into Huaihai Fang is low Figure 6.1e shows the existing entrances to the neighbourhood.

Figure 6.1 e ­ Two Entrance of Huaihai Fang, one locates at the northwest corner and one locates at the southeast corner of the neighbourhood.

78

Huaihai Fang is a typical colonial Li-Nong which was seen as a successful "selfcontained" and "live- shop/work" community during the colonial period and First World War period. In the past, residents in Huaihai Fang occupied the laneways and the surrounding public spaces like home. Different kinds of social activities happened in the laneway market. Figure 6.1f to 6.1i shows the different kinds of activities in Huaihai Fang. However, due to the deterioration and closed-off shikumen configuration with limited entrances, the local laneway market and the public social life in Huaihai Fang are struggling to survive.

The ultimate reason for the laneway market to fail serving its purpose is because there is a lack of visitors to support the laneway market on Nan Chang Road and the inner laneway street in Huaihai Fang that is hidden from the public. As a majority of the laneway shops are located on Nan Chang Road, there is a need to open the south side of the neighbourhood to the public so as to reintroduce the social crowd in Huaihai Fang. Figure 6.1j & 6.1k shows the two main programs along Nan Chang Road which is a one-way street that leads traffic toward Maoming South Road. There are two components on Nan Chang Road. An elementary school locates closer to Shaanxi South Road, and a series of shikumen laneway shops near Maoming South Road. With a greater pedestrian and vehicular flow on Shaanxi South Road than Maoming South Road and further away from existing two entrances, the idea is to take the school as a new gateway into Huaihai Fang.

By transforming the school ground floor into a pubic and neighbourhood friendly marketplace, the school acts as a catalyst to stimulate the current residents' social life in the neighbourhood. It also attracts people to visit the new marketplace and the traditional laneway market next to it.

6.2 ­ Concept: The Continuity
Through re-working the ground floor of the school and the playground, a new social public market will be introduced. Open market / covered recreation space, and a running/walking track will be introduced to create shared spaces among the school and Huaihai Fang neighbourhood. The word "Continuity" is expressed in different ways to tie this transformation of school with its existing neighbourhood contextually, visually and socially. Figure 6.2a is a conceptual image of "continuity" for this project that reveals the inner laneway market to the public visually and physically.

6.3 ­ Design Proposal
Figure 6.3a shows the current layout of the school. There are 16 regular classrooms, 4 special rooms in the main building, a gym building and administration building with staff rooms. The only connection between the three buildings is the bridge from the third floor of the gym building to the fourth floor of the main building. The administration and staff office building is completely separated from the main and gym building. Fences and trees are placed to fill up the gap between the three buildings; making the school a block that divides the old and new retail street and hide the inner laneway market completely.

6.3.1 ­ The "Good Morning!" Plaza & the Running Track

Figure 6.3.1 a ­ The "Good Morning" Plaza

The "Good Morning!" Plaza is the public morning exercise ground on the other end of the running track with circular patches of greens, wood decks and stone chess / majong tables. It provides the residents a place to exercise, play majong and do Tai Chi any time. Surrounded by the preserved shikumen and traditional laneway market, it is also a resting place for visitors to sit and feel the neighbourhood. A running track will be introduced to loop around the Good Morning Plaza, the laneway market and the playground / new market space in the school. It is a shared amenity for the Winnie Lam Ho Suen | AGORA 2012 | Dr. June Komisar | November 15, 2011 88

neighbourhood and the school. Part of the track will be closed during the school hours. However the school still have the priority to use the full track for physical education classes if needed. The track extends the activity space beyond the school. The track will also function as a guide to walk the visitors into the inner laneway market during the off-school period through the school / new market entrance.

The ground floor of the school building will be recreated into an open playground which is also the basketball court and the covered art-land/ assembly space for the school during the day. Students' art-work can be put on the walls and can be hung from the ceiling in the enclosed market space as a display showcase for the school.

Figure 6.3.2 b ­ Night market on Friday night in the open market (basketball court) & covered art-land (covered playground)

At night, the ground floor of the school will be turned into a night marketplace where residents from the nearby neighbourhood can gather after dinner to perform common Chinese social activities such as chatting, group dancing, TaiChi, small carnivals and mid night snacks booths. The market acts as a funnel to collect social crowds from the surrounding neighbourhood and introduce more visitors to the inner and outer laneway market. Besides, part of the retail shikumen in the south and east side will also be remodelled to increase the retail area and the number of entrances into the inner shikumen laneway retails. With a higher permeability into the neighbourhood and more shops, it eases people to get into the neighbourhood. By going through the outer laneway retail into the inner laneway retails, visitors can also experience the live-shop life-style in a traditional shikumen neighbourhood.

A new passageway is created from the existing north entrance to the new south entrance of the Huaihai Fang neighbourhood. It enables a direct vehicular and pedestrian circulation by passing through the heritage / historical area and the new market / playground area. When ones is looking south into the Huaihai Fang, he or she will immediately see the three big Chinese character hanging from the existing school wall. These three characters are the Chinese words for Huai-Hai-Fang and are appeared on the stone gateway at the south entrance as well.

By opening up the ground floor of the school, people can easily see and access the shops in the inner laneway. This hidden laneway and the shikumen around it are located in the non- preserved area. In order to keep the traditional Shanghai-nese style live-work environment, only minimal modification is made to keep the originality and architectural style of this neighbourhood. After modifying the ground floor of the peripheral shikumen, the shops become bigger and can be access on both sides of the street.

Materials In order to mix the new market school with the existing context, materials with similar color and texture are picked. Concrete cladding, Corten steel, Sand stone, Galvanized steel, wood and glass will be used on the exterior facade of the main school building. Rubber flooring will be used for the running track and basketball court. The running track will be painted in bright color as one of the major feature of the new market/ playground. The fence at the front facade will be replaced by bushes and shrubs to avoid visual blockage into the inner laneway market from the street. Circular wood decks and patches of lawn will be applied to the "Good Morning!" Plaza.
