Abstract
Mehrnaz Tabibi. OPTOACOUSTIC IMAGING OF GOLD NANOROD BASED PHOTOTHERMAL THERAPY M. Sc. Biomedical Physics Ryerson University, Toronto, 2011 Gold Nanorod Photothermal Therapy (GNR-PTT) is a minimally invasive technique and an alternative to surgery for destroying tumors while sparing normal tissues. Gold Nanorods (GNRs) with strong extinction peaks in the near infra-red (NIR) spectrum is a good candidate to convert light into thermal energy to destroy tumors. Opto-acoustic imaging (OAI) is a non-invasive method that detects time-resolved acoustic waves created by short pulses of NIR in tissue. It leads to a pressure rise in the irradiated volume. The question of whether OAI is a suitable candidate for temperature monitoring of GNR-PTT in the NIR spectrum was examined. In this thesis, for the first time, GNRs in a gel phantom was used to monitor the temperature during PTT with different laser powers and GNR concentrations. The imaging was performed by a commercial device IMAGIO, Seno, TX. The results show changes of the OA signal follow to temperature changes. The concentration of GNR and the power have a significant role in producing good results.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Cancer
Cancer is a term used for a group of diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and are able to invade the surrounding and distant healthy tissues. Cancer cells can spread from its origin to other parts of the body area through the blood and lymph systems. This spread, called metastasis can result in death [1]. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy and removal or destruction of the tumor by surgery or ablation, or a combination of these approaches are typical cancer treatments [2, 3]. The most direct therapeutic intervention for cancer is surgery. Removing all cancerous cells is the goal of cancer surgery. Choosing surgery depends on factors such as type, size, and location of the tumor. Cancer surgery is not suitable for the treatment of smaller and poorly visible tumors that are deeply embedded in crucial organs. New treatment methods like high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), Laser Interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) and radio frequency (RF) ablation are alternative choices for cancer surgery [2-4].

1.2 Thermal Therapy
Many sources of energy, including laser, microwave, and ultrasound are being investigated for tissue heating. Each has advantages and disadvantages. HIFU is a non- invasive
1   

 

method that can raise tissue temperatures up to 100 ºC. Long duration treatment and nonspecificity are disadvantages of HIFU. Although RF ablation and microwaves are both noninvasive methods of thermal therapy, they are restricted to being close to the tissue.

Figure 1.1 LITT in ex-vivo porcine liver. The lesion was created using 6W laser for 6 minutes. Lesion with this size cannot be created in-vivo because the cooling effect of blood perfusion. [Adapted from Heisterkamp et al.] Thermal therapy dates back to 1700 BC when the glowing tip of a fire drill was used for breast cancer therapy [5, 6]. It targets small localized solid tumors to destroy them by coagulation. Because of the poor blood supply to the tumors, their heat tolerance compared to normal tissue is reduced, leading to their destruction. Hyperthermia causes irreversible cell damage by fluidizing cell membranes and denaturing proteins [6, 7]. Thermal therapy in the temperature range from 41-47 ºC has had limited success. Cell death is the result of coagulative necrosis which happens after heating of tissue above 55ºC for two minutes [8-11]. Temperatures greater than 55ºC, particularly 60 -100 ºC or even more, led to

2   

 

significant tissue ablation and a successful result. The goal of thermal therapy is to ablate the tumor plus proper distance of margin in the surrounding to normal tissue [4]. Clinical trials have shown thermal therapy is a suitable treatment for head, neck, sarcoma, melanoma, lung, prostate, brain, breast, bladder, cervix, and liver [12]. The usage of light as a therapy modality has been known for more than three thousand years ago, when ancient Egyptian, Indian and Chinese civilizations applied it to treat various diseases, like psoriasis, rickets vitiligo and skin cancer. More than 100 years ago, researchers also observed combination of light and certain chemicals could induce cell death [13]. Ophthalmologists in 1963 reported using lasers in surgery. In 1965 tumor eradication was reported by laser, and then was followed by much attention in late 1960s. There are two ways for transmitting laser light: 1- external: exposing light on the tumors in the air by optical fiber tip, 2interstitial: distributing into a restricted area by inserting the unconcealed end of the fiber into the center of the target tumor. The second method is called interstitial laser hyperthermia [6]. Monochromaticity, collimation and coherence identify laser light characteristics. These three make a high precised and minimal power loss of a high intensity narrow beam, which transmits almost deep down into the target tissue [6]. Photothermal therapy has been demonstrated using near infrared (NIR) radiant energy and metal nanoparticles. The nanoparticles efficiently absorb radiant energy and convert it to heat, leading to temperature increases up to 50°C or more [12, 14, 15].

Penetration depth of the laser irradiation in tissue is one of the crucial concerns in imaging and therapy. The absorption coefficient of the various tissues is one of the factors which decrease the penetration depth and it depends on the wavelength. High power laser output up to tens to hundreds of watts has to be used to efficiently induce the tumor ablation [18, 19].

1.3 Gold Nanorod Thermal Therapy
 

Photothermal therapy alone does not distinguish between cancer and normal cells. Nonselectivity is the major disadvantage of laser therapy. Both normal and tumor cells in the path of laser light are damaged. The use of optical photo-absorbers are taken up by a tumor, is one solution for overcoming this problem. It causes normal tissues to not drastically absorb Near Infra Red (NIR) wavelengths, and minimizes the damage. Photo-absorbers are able to generate optical resonance in the region in the tumor. They absorb light and it guides to transitions of electrons from the ground level to the excited level. The electronic excitation energy consequently relaxes through non-radiative decay processes channels. This leads to an increase in the kinetic energy and creates overheating of the local environment around the light probe, in the tumor lesion. The temperature creates tissue coagulation and cell death [18]. In recent years, development of nanotechnology has afforded a variety of nanostructures with unique optical properties that are valuable in biology and biomedical applications [20]. Introducing photo-thermal agents in the form of anisotropic gold nanoparticles is one approach. Plasmon-resonant gold nanoparticles are appealing in several respects: (a) their intrinsic toxicity is low; (b) their optical resonances can be optimized for specific NIR frequencies by a function of size and shape of the particle; (c) their small size (<100 nm) enable

4   

 

transport through vessels  and  adsorption by diseased cells and tissues; and (d) their plasmon enhanced properties enable them to serve as contrast agents for biological imaging[18, 21].  Strong absorption cross section and highly efficient light to heat conversions are the basis of photothermal agents. These factors decrease the amount of energy and ensure effective laser therapy at relatively lower energies rendering the therapy method minimally invasive. At present, gold nanospheres, gold nanorods, gold nanoshells, gold nanocages, and carbon nanotubes are the principal nanostructures that have been used in photo thermal therapeutics. Gold nano- particles strongly absorb light due to their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) oscillations in the visible and NIR regions. They have distinctive specifications: easily prepared, capable of functionalization and tunable optical properties [18] . In pre-clinical investigations of photothermal therapy, increasing the temperature as much as 30°C  higher than initial temperature was produced using near infrared laser light tuned to matching photoasborbers causing irreversible tumor damage [15-17]. Gold nanoparticles are hydrophobic. After injecting the nanoparticles in the blood, they are exposed to plasma proteins. The reticulo-endothelial system removes them rapidly from blood circulation. However, coating the nanoparticles with hydrophobic polymer chains such as polyethylene glycol can improve the blood circulation time notably and it can restrain the immunogenic responses.[6, 17] Gold nanoparticles can have desirable chemical properties; they are chemically stable and inherently biocompatible, and they do not interact with other existing components in a tissue microenvironment. In the past, gold nanoparticles (GNP) have been used for long term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with doses of up to 1.2-1.8g/year for 10 years. Such lengthened treatment

time with gold salts lead to the creation of gold crystals and their deposition in macrophages [6, 17]. This is known a chrysiasis. It has no pathological effects and is considered to be merely cosmetic. In addition, chrysiasis only develops after passing the threshold of at least 20mg/kg gold content or after directing a few grams intravenously. Therefore, the long term exposure to GNP does not seem to have detrimental effect [18].

El-Syed, calculated the expected absorption and scattering properties of different types of gold nanoparticles. By reviewing the optical properties of different shapes and sizes of gold nanoparticles, Gold NanoRods (GNRs) supply the strongest light absorption for their size [22].

The relation between the aspect ratio of gold nano-rods and their peak absorption is presented in Fig.1.3. By increasing aspect ratio, gold nanorods absorb light at longer wavelengths.

1.4 Monitoring Gold nanorod Thermal Therapy
 

As it was already mentioned irradiating with laser light creates SPR of nanoparticles and it generates heat. The SPR increases the temperature of hot electron of the nanostructures to reach thousands of Kelvins on the time scale of about 100 ps [18]. The temperature pattern is able to reach tens of degrees Celsius. During photothermal therapy, it is desirable to monitor, noninvasively, the tissue temperature for safety and efficacy. The ideal spatial resolution for the control over temperature distribution has to be on the order of a millimeter, and temperature resolution should be less than 1 ºC. There are various techniques for monitoring the temperature during photothermal therapy [22].
7   

 

Each monitoring technique has advantages and disadvantages [23]. Although infrared thermography is a real-time method with 0.1ºC accuracy, it is limited to surface temperature measurement only [12]. Ultrasound (US) is an inexpensive method; it can be applied for real time measurements at depth, however, the accuracy of temperature monitoring is poor and the temperature range is limited to 5 ºC. The other technique is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). High resolution and accuracy are its advantages. Disadvantages are the complexity of the technique implementation, and expense [12].

1.5 Optoacoustic Monitoring
 

Optoacoustic imaging is a novel technique to measure temperature by tracking the temperature- induced changes in the optoacoustic signal amplitude [24, 25]. To create a strong optoacoustic signal two conditions should be met: thermal confinement and stress confinement. To achieve thermal confinement, the laser pulse duration, p, should be smaller than the thermal dissipation duration, th, (in other words the heat diffusion is minimal during the excitation pulse). To achieve stress confinement, the time for the stress to travel through the absorbing structure should be smaller than, p. After fulfilling both conditions, the pressure rise P(z) due to the thermoelastic expansion produces an optoacoustic (OA) signal. Optoacoustic pressure generation was discovered by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century [12]. First he reported the observation of sound generation by light in 1880. He showed that thin discs emitted sound when exposed to a beam of sunlight that was rapidly interrupted with a rotating slotted disk. The absorbed energy from the sunlight is transformed
8   

 

into kinetic energy of the sample. This results in local heating with expansion of the absorbing material, produces a pressure wave, or sound. The optoacoustic technique has been recently applied in biomedical imaging. Some of the applications are breast tumor imaging, real time blood oxygen monitoring, brain functional and structural imaging, and tumor angiogenesis [7, 26]. Also OA imaging can be a suitable candidate to monitor the temperature of tissue during thermal therapy. This technique is real time in clinical applications such as ophthalmologic laser surgery and photothermal therapy [27, 32]. The GNR may be the best preference for thermal therapy not only due to the preferential heating that can be achieved but the fact that using OA imaging can be used for a temperature monitoring. GNR absorption is very sensitive to the aspect ratio (length/width). Additionally, their peak absorption can be tuned in the NIR by adjusting the aspect ratio for these nanoaparticles.

1.6 Hypothesis
 

The objective of this research is to explore the potential of using optoacoustic imaging for monitoring the temperature variation during a photo thermal procedure. Also this research attempts to verify that optoacoustic imaging is a reliable technique for detecting and imaging tissue mimicking gel phantoms with GNRs. Therefore the hypothesis is that optoacoustics can be used to detect heating caused by gold nanorod photothermal therapy.

Chapter 2 Theory
2.1 Optoacoustic (OA) Generation
 

Optoacoustic imaging is a method that relies on absorbtion of electromagnetic energy and consequent acoustic wave generation. By irradiation a medium with a 5 to 10 nanosecond pulse an instant rapid heating around 0.01 -1°C is produced; it causes an expansion or a strain in the substance (around 10-5) resulting in a broad band acoustic wave. The wave detected by a transducer exhibits a pressure rise, P, in the irradiated volume and is represented by a voltage increase as shown in Fig 2.1.

Figure 2.1 Schematic representation of the generation of optoacoustic signals by detection of ultrasound transducer of hit light pulse to the tissue.

11   

An optoacoustic signal is produced by the transient heating of a restricted volume using light energy. This condition is referred to as "stress confinement" and for providing this condition, it is necessary that a laser pulse irradiates the object in a very short time to achieve stress confinement. The duration of the laser pulse should be much less than the amount of time that acoustic energy needs to propagate out of the area of absorption [28].  In a planar medium, there is represented as the (1)

, and the optical

Generally three categories of tissue properties can effect the generation of an optoacoustic wave.

2.1.1 Optical property (Pure absorption)
 

According to the Beer Lambert Law [29-31], there is a logarithmic dependence between the transmission (or transmissivity) of light, Tr = (2) , and the

through a substance or product of the absorption coefficient of the substance,

distance the light travels through the material, . The absorption coefficient can be related to: (3) as a product concentration, c, by extinction coefficient, .

is the intensity after depth  and I0 is the initial intensity of light. When large absorption

values are measured, dilution is required to achieve accurate results. Therefore, log Also, absorbance becomes linear with the concentration (or number density of absorbers)  (6) (7) (8) H (y) is the fluence at depth y and H0 is the fluence at the surface. (5)

  13   

Therefore, the attenuation of light has a direct relation to the concentration of GNRs. By diluting, the concentration of GNR, the absorption of the medium in will decrease [29-31]. Details about the GNR used in this work can be found in the chapter 3.

2.1.2 Heat Generation
 

The general formula for heat generation is: . (9)

which  and C in order are the density and specific heat capacity of the medium. k is the thermal conductivity and QS is the external heat source. There are two lasers utilized in this work. One is used to heat the phantom and another is used for optoacoustic imaging. The second item in equation (9) is the external heat source : (10) in photothermal therapy is dependent on the laser fluence, H, which characterizes the light distribution in tissue, and the tissue absorption coefficient, a [27, 28] which in the presence of gold nanorods increases tissue heating.   In this thesis is the combination of both lasers heating and imaging. , the energy density can be expressed as a

Given the incident radiant exposure, H(y) function of depth with the following equation .

(11) This energy will be converted to heat. , is the laser fluence on the surface incedience.
14   

Gold nanorods generally behave as photoabsorbers in photothermal therapy. In clinical studies they are injected either directly into the tumor or intravenously. Because of the small size of nanoparticles (10-100nm), the incident nanosecond laser irradiation does not meet the principal requirements of stress and thermal confinement. In its place, there will be an instantaneous heating between nanoparticles and the immediate surrounding tissue. Therefore the nanoparticles act as a local heat source that their temperature decrease quickly and transfer to the surrounding tissue which increase the thermal expansion of tissue and leads to generate a strong optoacoustic signal without the existence of any photoabsorbers.

2.1.3 Mechanical
 

The pressure wave can be described as:   (12) (13)

The Grüneisen parameter ( ) is related to thermo-dynamical and mechanical properties of thre medium. Both the absorption coefficient of light ( medium. Therefore the initial pressure distribution, ) and laser fluence depend on the

 represents the fraction of absorbed light energy converted to mechanical (acoustic) energy. Generation of optoacoustic waves is the result of the optical and mechanical properties of the medium. By considering the relationship between different parameters as shown in the
15   

following equations, it can be shown that an induced temperature change yields a change in volume and leads to pressure variation,  . So pressure, P, in any time or depth will be:

heat capacity at constant pressure, the heat capacity at the constant volume, thermal coefficient of volume expansion and the absorbed energy density. The Grüneisen parameter is a dimensionless, temperature dependent factor proportional to the fraction of thermal energy converted into mechanical stress.

16   

For an increase in temperature from 20 °C to 30°C, the volume expansion coefficient of water changes from 0.2×10-3 (K)-1 to 0.3×10-3 (K)-1 and the speed of sound from 1481 m/s to 1507m/s [17]. This causes a 50% rise in optoacoustic signal for a 10°C increasing of temperature (an almost 5% per Celsius degree variation in signal amplitude). As a result, the Grüneisen parameter, , and thus optoacoustic signal is directly related to temperature in water based tissues[32].     a and b are constants and T is the water temperature. Eq. 23 proves a basis for monitoring temperature using optoacoustic pressure signals during the photothermal therapy. Therefore the temperature variation is proportional to changes of OA pressure and Grüneisen parameter during photothermal therapy [24, 33].
 Also, it can be written, if P is the initial pressure and P' is the pressure after OA laser

3.2 Experimental Setup
 

The optoacoustic imaging system, IMAGIO, (Seno Medical Instruments Inc. San Antonio, TX, USA), (Fig.3.1), creates and detects sound pressure waves generated by stimulating the sample with pulsed laser energy to obtain images of structures inside the sample. 

 

Figure 3.1 A view of IMAGIO, optoacoustic device used in all experiments
    20   

The main components of the system are a probe containing at least one ultra wide band ultrasound transducer with signal detection circuitry, an electronics unit containing data processing and image construction circuitry, a user control interface and a pulsed laser illumination source containing a laser source with a light delivery device (the articulated arm in (Fig.3.1)). The phantom was placed in the examination reservoir near the probe in a manner that enables laser light to be applied to the GNR gel phantom. The space between the external layer GNR gel phantom and the detector elements require a coupling medium like water to fill the void so that ultrasonic waves can reach the ultrasound detector (Fig.3.1) [34]. The IMAGIO reservoir was filled with a sufficient amount of degassed water to cover the upper surfaces of the phantom; the location of the IMAGIO laser and the transducer are 5 cm below the top of IMAGIO reservoir (Fig.3.2), (Fig.3.5) [34]. The phantom mold was attached to a frame which was attached a phantom holder. The phantom was positioned between the laser light probe and the ultrasound transducer of the IMAGIO. The three coordinate axes of the device are shown in the (Fig.3.2). The heating laser was a Diomed 60 (Cambridge Research Panel, Cambridge, UK). The laser was coupled to the phantom through a 1000 m core, standard hard cladding multimode, low OH fiber (BFL37-1000-Custom, THORLABS, Newton, NJ, USA), which was situated over the phantom perpendicularly. The distance between the top layer of the phantom and fiber tip was around 25 mm, and the focal point of the heating laser was focused in the middle of the width of the phantom as shown in (Fig.3.3) and (Fig. 3.4).

21   

AS fluoroptic thermometer (Luxtron Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA, model 3100), was embedded perpendicularly from the center of the top surface and inserted half way through the GNR gel phantom (Fig.3.4).

Figure 3 .2 Experiment setup The focal point of the transducer array was determined to be around 25 mm ± 2.5 mm from the transducer surface. The middle layer of the phantom was placed at the transducer focus. The front surface of the middle layer of the phantom that contained GNRs, was 15 mm away from the transducer. This distance was measured manually by a ruler. Averaging the received RF signals is one of the factors that increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Averaging is done by collecting several RF lines resulting from a number of laser pulses and averaging the RF lines in the time domain. The number of averages were 8,16 and 64 (table 4.1).

3.3.1 Layered Phantom geometry
 

The tissue mimicking gel phantom can be thought of as simplified layers of body tissues in three layers: two external layers and one internal. The upper layer of the gel is the external layer that may contain skin and similar tissues, and the middle layer mimicked a tumor with GNR were injected to enhance the imaging contrast and thermal therapy efficiency and the bottom layer was 3external layer (Fig.3.7).

3.3.2 Gel preparation
 

Porcine skin gelatin powder was added gradually to water which was warmed by a heater (Rose scientific Ltd, USA, model IKA C-MAG HS-7 S1) up to 90ºC as measured by a thermocouple (DATA LOGGER, OMEGAETTE HH306). The solution was stirred gently until the solution appearance changed to clear while ensuring the bubbles were not generated. Then the container of liquid gel was put on magnetic stirrer (Cole-Parmer, UK, 300Ma) until the temperature of the liquid gel dropped to 42ºC. Formaldehyde was added to the liquid, and after the temperature dropped to 40ºC, the liquid was poured into a brick shape mold. The mold was kept in a fridge while GNR gel layer was made. The procedure for making gel layer with GNR was identical with the first step except the water was replaced by a mixture of GNR and water and it was poured over the first layer into the brick shape mold. The third layer, a pure gel layer, was made similar to the first layer and was poured over the second layer. The three layered phantom was kept in the fridge until the entire phantom solidified.

3.4 Data acquisition
3.4.1 Temporal Scanning at a specific point during photothermal therapy
 

The GNR layer was made to examine how GNR could be used for imaging (by enhancing contrast) and therapy (to increase the light absorption). The spatial location at which RF data were acquired as a function of time was in the center of the phantom in the X direction, which was located 1.5 ­ 2 mm farther of the tip of the sensor of fluoroptic thermometer (Fig. 3.4). The location chosen could not be closer to the thermometer for two reasons: light from the OA laser could be scattered by the fluoroptic sensor; and the sensor could produce an artifact if the scan point was too close to the sensor. RF data was acquisition in three phases: the preheat phase, the heating phase (when the laser was turned on); and the cooling phase (when the heating
28   

laser was turned off) and RF data acquisition was continued for a pre-determined time or until the ambient temperature was reached.

3.4.2 Imaging before and after thermal therapy
 

The IMAGIO device scans in the X-Z plane to produce an image. For each location in the in the XZ plane, a line scan in the Z direction was performed in discrete spatial time steps while RF data were collected along the Y direction (Fig.3.2). Images were collected before and after heating. The location of acquisition of single RF lines is at the center of phantom in the X direction. The duration of imaging depends on the area and step size. Another factor that affects the duration is the number of averages for the RF data. The number of averages can enhance the quality of the image by increasing the signal to noise ratio (SNR).

3.5 Data processing
 

After the experiment, all of the OA data sets were stored to a PC for further analysis. Images of the phantom were made in the preheat phase and after cooling. The A-scan or RF data were used to create data graphs to study the variation of the OA signal during thermal therapy for different powers and GNRs concentration (table 3.1). Also all of the temperature data acquired by Luxtron thermometer were stored for further analysis. The Optoacoustic signal, P ( , , can be calculated as a function of space and slow-time. P , =P ( , t) (37)

29   

which

is time difference between when the sound wave is generated and the detected called is

the fast-time, t is the duration time after starting the experiment called the slow-time, and

the distance of the OA signal to the transducer along the horizontal line between transducer and OA laser. In order to detect the envelope of the OA signal, the absolute values of the Hilbert transform of the P , was determined, , = P , , [35].

The last quarter of the RF signals collected during the experiments was analyzed. This represented the phantom region closest to the OA laser (Fig.3.12). This region had the highest optical illumination and should, therefore, produce the strongest optoacoustic signal provided the optical absorption in the GNR phantom was uniform. The OA signal was integrated in this region to determine the area under the between two distances of yi and yf . , (38) RF line

This was repeated RF lines collected as a function of time to produce graph of IOA vs. t (Fig.3.14).

The data sampling of temperature vs. time was greater than the data sampling of IOA vs. time since: 1- Temperatures were measured before OA measurement started and ended after OA measurements ended (Fig.3.15). 2- The time interval between temperature measurements data was shorter than that between OA signal measurements.

35   

The two sets data of

(t) and T (t) have time as a common axis. To relate data were interpolated to match the

(t) and (t) time-

T(t) and provide a common time axis, the points to produce (T) graph (Fig. 3.16).

 

Figure 3.15 Variation of Temperature with time for a laser exposure of almost 2 minutes
 

Fig.3.3 and Fig.3.4 show the location of fluoroptic thermometer and the location that the RF data were collected. It is noted that the temperature was not measured at the same location as the OA pressure signal during the experiments. Therefore, in T-t graph the X axis does not represent the temperature of the last quarter of phantom. This is an important point as the signal of analysis region is location 13 mm away from where these temperatures were measured.

36   

Therefore, the temperatures were measured, cannot be directly related the OA data. However qualitative changes in the temperature are expected to be symmetric about the center of the phantom.

3.6 Ranking Method
   

After visual inspection of the eighteen sets of results, some items were checked to rank the results. Ranking was based on the linearity of the IOA (T) graphs. It means, after turning the laser on, the temperature increases and this increase corresponds to an ascending hypothetical line on the IOA(T) graph. Also the temperature decrease corresponds t a hypothetical descending line. If these two ascending and descending lines of one set of experiments are corresponds to each other, set of experiment places at the first rank of linearity. If these lines are a little away due to each other, that set gets the next rank. Ranking is based on the amount of the distance of the two lines due to each other. Therefore the Table 4.1 was made based on this assumption of linearity.

                         

38   

 

Chapter 4 Results
Eighteen sets of experiments were carried out using four series of different dilutions of GNRs exposed to four different powers for each set of dilution, as described in the methods section. In all eighteen cases of temperature variation versus time, a common trend was observed. Ranking of experiments was based on the linearity of the IOA ­T diagrams. According to these criteria a consistency table was made (Table 4.1). As was mentioned in section 3.4.1 before and after laser heating, two images were taken of the region of interest (ROI). The image shows an OA image of the ROI of the phantom of the phantom before laser heating. (Fig.4.1) shows image of the ROI before heating on the phantom which will be explained in next chapter. The data of experiments in different powers and dilutions according to table 3.1 for the three stages of preheat, heating and cooling, will be presented in (Fig.4.2) to (Fig.4.19) as a) a change of temperature with time, T(t), b) a change of integrerated OA signal with time, IOA (t), c) the change of OA signal with temperature, IOA (T). In all of the eighteen set of the figures (Fig.4.2) to (Fig.4.19) in part (a), all the temperatures measured by the fluoroptic thermometer, which it's sensor was 2 mm away of

scanning point. It is necessary to mention that this temperature is different by the analyzing area which is loated in the last quarter region of the phantom.

Chapter 5 Discussion
 

This thesis presents a method of using gold nanorods (GNRs) for photothermal therapy. GNRs are used to increase heating and as a contrast agent for imaging. Eighteen sets of experiments were carried out with four different types of GNR dilutions and various laser powers. In all of the eighteen sets the plots of temperature vs. time were recorded: before, during and after laser heating. The result shows that the use of GNR enhances both the contrast between phantom material with and without GNRs and also improves the photothermal therapy temperature efficiency and tracking. The selected range for analyzing the optoacoustic data was in the region of the phantom closest to the OA laser. The optoacoustic signal should be maximized in this region due to the exponential nature of the OA laser fluence with depth. At greater depths the light intensity decreases in relation to the absorption coefficient of the phantom material [36].   The location of the RF measurement is the middle of X direction of the phantom and the fluoroptic thermometer is almost 2 mm further in the X direction. The last quarter of the phantom in the Y direction was approximately 30 to 35 mm from the transducer, while the location of the fluoroptic thermometer is estimated to be 27 mm from transducer (Fig.3.3) and (Fig.3.4). As the tip of the heating fiber was pointed to the center of the top surface of the phantom, then the temperature of the phantom at 23 mm from the transducer should have the same temperature at 27 mm. Therefore, it can be concluded by passing a hypothetical circle with
61   

 

a 2 mm radius is drawn around the center point of the phantom which passes the points of 23mm and 27 mm distance from the transducer has the same temperature (Fig.3-4). Therefore it is assumed that the scanning point and the fluoroptic thermometer have the same temperature. Heat transfer produces a temperature gradient from the source to the analyzed area. The temperature gradient can potentially vary strongly with distance [37, 38]. Also the phantom is surrounded with water that causes to cool down the phantom. Since the water cools the phantom near the boundaries, the temperature at the measurement location and at the boundary is probably not linearly related. If, on the other hand, the temperature at these locations are linearly related, then collinearity can be used as a criteria. Hence, all of the diagrams which present the variation IOA vs. T do not indicate the temperature profile at the location that the OA signal was collected, but are likely representative of the general trends of temperature profiles all the locations that the OA signal was collected. For this reason, graphs of IOA (T) were presented without numerical values for temperature. Table 4.1 shows that lowest maximum temperature is 72°C among the first seven of data sets. As the temperature increases, the two types of the diagrams T-t, IOA(t), have a steeper slope. Signal averaging decreases the OA signal noise and therefore it is anticipated that it is related to increasing the SNR. Table 4.1 illustrates that, GNRs phantoms with factors of two and five dilution, led to better results based on the linearity criteria. Increasing power also lead to better results based on the linearity criteria. However, range of factor four dilutions which have lower dilution of GNRs did not follow the same linearity criteria.

62   

 

In table 4.1 it is apparent that the ratio of thermal laser power to the dilution of the GNRs solution was a major determinant in consistency of the results. When this ratio is greater than 1.5, experiments show good linearity between the OA signal and temperature. High power and less dilution of GNR have the most major role for obtaining these results. Experimental uncertainties may explain some of the variability of the results in the thesis. Some of these uncertainties include: 1Gel phantom heterogeneity. This could cause some locations receiving a higher

concentration of GNRs, higher absorption and therefore generating higher temperatures and stronger signals. 2Heating laser alignment to the phantom surface may produce light reflection and

therefore variable heating; it depends on the angle of the laser fiber with the top surface plane of the gel phantom. 3The gel phantom was made of porcine skin. The threshold temperature for porcine skin

coagulation is between 92 and 104°C [43]. Among 18 experiments, 4 had maximum temperatures of greater than 90°C, with two of them nearly 100°C. Of those 4 experiments and (2X - 10W) in Fig.(4-6) and (2X - 5W) in Fig.(4-8) produced results that are consisted with gel coagulation, but (2X - 10W) in Fig.(4-6) produced results that were not conclusive and (2X 5W) in Fig.(4-8) produced results not to indicative of coagulation. Therefore, the role of coagulation in the findings is unclear. 4Table 4-1 indicates that the dilution factor of GNRs has a significant role on the GNRs with high concentration (or less dilution), produce

maximum temperature obtained.

higher maximum temperatures. There was a limitation on the maximum temperature in order to

63   

 

prevent of damage the thermal laser fiber. The maximum temperature should not exceed 100°C.This limitation did not allow an investigation of the relation between maximum temperature and dilution factor of GNRs consistently for all sets of experiments. This limitation affected two experiments (2X ­ 8W) in Fig. (4-7) and (2X ­ 10W) in Fig. (4-6). In these experiments the heating duration was less than the others. By considering the heating laser power of the rank numbers 7, 8 and 15, which is 5W for all dilution factors of 2, 5, 6, it can be concluded that the dilution factor related to the rank. Also the intensity of heating laser is another factor which affects the results. By referring the table 4.1, it can be observed that higher power helps to obtain better ranking results. On the other hand, the ratio of power over the dilution factor correlated with rank. Table 4.1 shows that the power/dilution is equal to or greater than 1.5, for the top seven ranked experiments. The combination of higher power and greater nanorod concentration leads to higher temperatures and therefore greater changes in the optoacoustic singal. If gel coagulation would occur, this would likely lead to irreversible changes in the optoacoustic signal which would likely impact the ranking. One of the consequences of photothermal therapy is increasing the OA signal amplitude with the temperature and changes in acoustic properties such as speed of sound and density. The sharp increase in temperature, especially more than 55 to 70 °C could lead to change in the Grüneisen coefficient. An increase in the Grüneisen coefficient can increase the OA signal. By observing the RF lines (A-scan) during heating (Fig.5.1) and cooling (Fig.5.2), it can be seen that OA signal increased during heating and decreased during cooling.

64   

 

By increasing both the thermal laser power and concentration of GNR it can help to decrease the heating duration since the target temperature can be attained in a shorter time. Also in most cases IOA (T) increased during heating. Graphs have a steeper slope when higher power is used for the thermal laser irradiation and when higher concentration of GNRs are used due to the increased power deposition. There is a possibility that as gel phantom was made of porcine skin some of the ingredients include fat. In fat tissue, as temperature increases the speed of sound and thermal expansion coefficient decrease [12, 27]. Figures (Fig.5.1) and (Fig.5.2) also show that the OA signal shifted towards the left during heating and shifted towards the right during cooling. In other words the peak of the OA signal moved closer to the transducer during heating and shifted further from the transducer during cooling. This suggests that changes occureed in the speed of sound of the phantom during the temperature increases. Optoacoustic thermal monitoring is based on temperature induced changes in the speed of sound and the volume expansion coefficient. Both speed of sound and the volume expansion coefficient have a nearly linear relationship with temperature range (Fig.4.21) [27]. The data were analyzed, primarily based on variation of the Hilbert transform of the optoacoustic signal as a function of temperature. We expected the integrated Hilbert OA signal to be linearly proportional to temperature. It was based on the assumption that there is no denaturation in pure gel and mixed by GNR gel. As it was mentioned in chapter 2, variation of optoacoustic signals during photothermal therapy for the gel phantom or GNR gel phantom

65   

 

should remain linear. Therefore, the optoacoustic signal variation with temperature during heating and cooling should the same.

It can be observed that in (Fig. 5.1) and (Fig. 5.2) in the region out-sided the phantom between (0 mm and 15mm) and (40 mm and 56.8 mm), the optoacoustic signal is proportional to temperature [44]. Water can produce an OA signal, and this is known to the temperature dependent. As heat transfers from the phantom to the surrounding area, heating the surrounding water, it may be the possible that these variations produced in the signal from the water ate related to this temperature increase.

Chapter 6 Conclusions and Future Work
6.1 Conclusions
In this thesis a real time and non- invasive technique for imaging and temperature monitoring during photothermal therapy is presented. In this work I examined how this technique can be used to monitor thermal therapy. The experiments were done on non-biological tissue, a tissue mimicking gel phantoms. The optoacoustic signal amplitude increased linearly with temperature when the ratio of the heating laser power over due to dilution times of GNR is equal or more than 1.5. 1.5 GNRs could not only be used to substantially increase the heating efficiency of photothermal therapy, but also to generate an optoacoustic signal. It was shown in this work that they are a suitable candidate for thermal therapy enhancement and optoacoustic imaging. Laser power and GNR concentration are two principal factors that determine the effectiveness of this technique. The ability to generate optoacoustic images in the tissue equivalent phantom, as well as the ability to detect changes in the optoacoustic signals as a function of the temperature in a mimicked tissue gel phantom during photothermal therapy confirms that optoacoustic imaging has the potential to monitor temperature elevation during

69   

 

photothermal therapy.

6.2 Future work
 

Experiments were performed on a GNR gel phantom which was a water based phantom. The variation of OA signal vs. temperature shows there is potentially a linear relationship between the temperature increase and the change in the optoacoustic signal. But in some sets of experiments, this linearity was not observed. As it was mentioned in the discussion the possibility of fat in porcine skin gel phantom makes an idea for research. The effect of fat tissue on these types of measurements should be carefully examined in the future. Photothermal therapy is based on heat transfer. Modeling the temperature changes during photothermal therapy (such as the effect of different GNR concentrations in the gel phantom on the temperature distribution and the optoacoustic signal) can be another research. Determining the (a) and (b) parameters in  of the equation 21 in chapter 2 could be

obtained by temperature measurement during photothermal therapy. Generating IOA (T) images during photothermal therapy instead signals as a single location is one of the next steps in the project. Generating images takes more time which depends to step size of the raster scan, the imaging area and the RF averaging.

Appendix A - RF lines
In this chapter all of the raw data during heating and cooling according to table 3.1 are sorted. The rising of the amplitude during heating shows the IOA (t) has a direct relation to the temperature. Also the falling the amplitude after turning off the heating laser shows this relation repeatedly. Legends indicate the time of firing of OA laser during the experiment for each RF line. The two purple dashed show the boundaries of phantom edges and their distances due to OA transducer. The rising of the RF line in area of the heating laser, around 25 m from the transducer, especially for the first six set is observable too.
