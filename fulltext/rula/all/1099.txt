Abstract  The  purpose  of  this  thesis  is  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  current  legal  measures  for  protecting  species  at  risk  in  Canada  through  an  interpretive  qualitative  method.    Four  species  case  studies  were  analyzed:    The  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike,  Jefferson  Salamander,  Northern  Spotted  Owl,  and  Vancouver  Island  Marmot.    Policy  recommendations  for  reforms  arising  from  the  research  are:    i)  interjurisdictional  cooperation  is  imperative  for  protecting  species  at  risk  ii)  dedicated  species  at  risk  legislation is crucial, and it is recommended that such legislation exist at both federal and  provincial  levels  iii)  flexibility  instruments  and  exemptions  to  existing  law  should  be  scientifically  informed  and  used  cautiously  iv)  private  landowners  are  significant  stakeholders  and  stewardship  efforts  are  important  v)  scientific  information  and  the  definition  of  critical  habitat  for  species  at  risk  are  crucial.    The  thesis  concludes  that  a  sciencebased precautionary approach to species protection is fundamental to address the  plight of species at risk in Canada.

CHAPTER 1.0 INTRODUCTION  This thesis is the result of reflecting upon the current biodiversity and extinction  crisis  that  is  taking  place  on  a  global  scale  (Novacek  and  Cleland,  2001).    Rates  of  species  extinctions  have  reached  alarming  proportions,  significantly  threatening  the  interconnected web of  biodiversity on the planet (Wilson, 1992: 254279 Myers, 1993  Pimm  et  al.,  1995).    Canada  is  not  immune  to  the  biodiversity  crisis.    Despite  the  country's  reputation  for  pristine  wilderness  and  healthy  natural  ecosystems,  it  is  beginning  to  exhibit  the  tolls  of  over  a  century  of  industrial  and  agricultural  activity.  Evidence  indicates  that  biodiversity  trends  in  Canada  are  pessimistic  and  numbers  of  species at risk continue to rise (Mosquin, 2000: 6876).  This thesis is motivated by the  following  question:    Which  policy  tools  and  instruments  could  be  more  effective  to  address problems of species at risk in Canada?  In response to that question, the primary  objective was to undertake an interpretive qualitative evaluation of existing legal tools for  species at risk in Canada.  The purposes of this thesis are to contribute to the legal body  of knowledge and to provide recommendations on `program improvement' for species at  risk preservation and legal measures, with a specific focus on provincial measures.  The  central  focus  of  the  thesis  is  that  legal  protection  should  be  science  based.    The  importance  of  scientifically  informed  species  at  risk  policy  and  legal  protection  is  emphasized  throughout.    The  effectiveness  of  implementation  of  existing  measures  for  individual  species  is  analyzed  through  four  case  studies  of  species  at  risk  in  two  provinces in Canada.  Legal  and  policy  tools  at  the  federal  and  provincial  levels  of  government  were  evaluated.    Case  studies  were  used  to  stress  the  importance  of  current  scientific  information  in  taking  a  precautionary  approach  to  the  formulation  of  legal  tools  and  policy  instruments  for  the  protection  of  species  at  risk.    In  order  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  implementation  of  policy  goals,  existing  legal  measures  and  policy  instruments must be individually evaluated and improvements devised.  This is the crux  of the thesis.  By  analyzing  individual  case  studies,  evidence  for  the  application  and  implementation  of  existing  policy  and  legal  tools  and  the  subsequent  outcomes  is  accumulated and evaluated.  The application of the legal tools and their implementation

1 

can be more readily understood.  In addition, the importance of scientific information for  the  creation  and  implementation  of  legal  tools  is  highlighted.    Moreover,  decisions  and  recommendations  for  improvement  can  be  more  easily  pinpointed  where  flaws  in  the  implementation  or  enforcement  of  legal  tools  are  evident.    Thus,  the  interpretive  qualitative  evaluation  of  case  studies  provides  supporting  material  for  new  recommendations.  The  protection  of  species  at  risk  is  central  to  mitigating  extinctions.    Scientific  facts are also crucial to understanding causes of individual species declines.  The existing  legal tools currently relied upon for managing species at risk must be scrutinized.  For a  policy  problem  of  this  sort,  legal  measures  tend  to  have  a  great  deal  of  potential  for  controlling human activities and effecting meaningful and consequential changes.  While  education  and  social  pressure  are  important  determinants  of  human  behaviour,  law  has  the  benefit  of  being  imbued  with  enforcement  powers  that  bind  citizens  to  follow  the  rules.    It  is  an  important  influence  because  it  is  backed  by  the  power  of  the  state  (Cunningham and Kagan, 2005 Kube and Traxler, 2010).  Law in the form of legislation  is  the  main  vehicle  for  the  implementation  of  policy.  Legislation  and  litigation  have  a  significant role in inducing government action (Amos et al., 2001 Elgie, 2003 Illical and  Harrison, 2007 Elgie, 2009).  Hence,  the  most  feasible  approach  to  mitigate  species  loss  is  by  developing  sciencebased  policy  and  implementing  sciencebased  legal  and  policy  tools.  Implementation,  to  be  effective,  needs  to  be  carried  out  at  both  the  national  and  sub  national levels in Canada.  Many policy treatments of species at risk to date have focused  attention on the federal level (Amos et al., 2001 Elgie, 2003 Illical and Harrison, 2007  Elgie,  2009).    A  very  significant  contribution  of  this  thesis  to  the  literature  is  to  focus  simultaneously on the policy tools available at the federal and provincial levels.  This  thesis  is  very  timely  as  biodiversity  protection  continues  to  remain  on  the  international agenda.  The United Nations proclaimed 2010 to be the International Year  of Biodiversity, in order to draw attention to the protocols outlined in the Convention on  Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992 as well as to encourage continued action to safeguard  biodiversity at present and onward into the future (CBD, 2010a).  The main objectives of  the Convention are as follows:  "the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable

2 

use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the  utilization of genetic resources" (CBD, 2010b).  In  attempts  to  address  the  biodiversity  crisis  within  national  borders,  and  by  signing  onto  international  treaties  such  as  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  in  1992, Canada has committed to policy goals for the protection of species at risk.  Some  provincial  governments  have  made  these  policy  goals  a  priority  as  well.    Some  policy  tools  have  been  implemented  over  the  last  three  decades  to  attempt  to  fulfill  species  at  risk  management  goals.    Presently,  many  such  goals  are  not  always  entirely  rooted  in  science.    As  is  the  case  with  much  of  the  environmental  policy  realm,  there  is  a  great  need for the intersection of science, law, and policy, for the effective implementation of  policy  goals  based  on  legal  and  policy  instruments.    Sound  science  is  imperative  for  defining  environmental  problems.    To  maximize  the  effectiveness  of  species  at  risk  protection, scientists recommend that species at risk policy be based on sound scientific  facts.  The effectiveness of policy goal implementation and legal and policy instruments  must also be  individually  evaluated.  As scientific  information changes, policies will  be  in  constant  need  of  evaluation  and  continuing  reform.    Where  required,  improvements  must be developed and implemented.  This thesis, an interpretive qualitative evaluation,  fits  into the final stages of the policy cycle, which  include  implementation of policy (in  the form of legal tools), policy evaluation, and legal reformulation and restatement.  The  policy cycle is illustrated in Figure 1.1.  In order to provide legitimacy and justification for the investment and diversion of  resources and personnel towards the preservation  of biodiversity, and  more specifically,  species at risk, the importance of biodiversity and the benefits that the variety of life on  Earth imparts must be comprehended.

1.1 Importance of Biodiversity and Threats to Biodiversity:  Why Should  Biodiversity Be Protected? 

1.1.1 Importance of Biodiversity:  Theories and Hypotheses on the Web of Life  Human beings are bound to the planet, and rely on its resources to survive.  On a  global  scale,  humans  are  only  a  minuscule  subset  of  the  balanced  and  harmonious  ecosystems  that  have  existed  for  centuries.    The  web  of  life  is  a  representation  of  the  diversity of life forms (MacArthur, 1955 Hutchinson, 1959 Wilson, 1992).  Every link  within the web of life interacts with other portions or links, forming the building blocks 

4 

to  vast  ecosystems  and  biomes  that  dot the  planet  extensively.    The  web  of  millions  of  species on Earth is the essence of biodiversity, or the diversity of life forms.  The  variety  and  richness  of  life  on  Earth  has  captivated  biologists  for  centuries.  The  concept  of  biodiversity  began  to  surface  in  the  works  of  prominent  ecologists  G.  Evelyn  Hutchinson  and  Robert  MacArthur  in  the  late  1950s.    In  the  1970s,  the  term  "natural diversity" was used to refer to the richness of species by the US environmental  nongovernmental organization, the Nature Conservancy.  It was not  until 1980 that the  word biodiversity or "biological diversity" was coined by Thomas Lovejoy in the Global  2000 Report to the President (Barney, 1980 Kramer et al., 1997: 117).  Biodiversity  represents  the  variety  and  diversity  of  all  life  forms  on  Earth,  including  genetic  diversity,  the  diversity  within  species,  between  species,  and  of  entire  ecosystems.  In simple and succinct ecological terms, biodiversity can also be defined as  species richness, or the number of species present in a defined geographical area (Wilson,  1992:  xii  Townsend  et  al.,  2000:  354).    B.A.  Wilcox  (1984)  defines  biodiversity  more  specifically  as  "the  variety  of  life  forms,  the  ecological  roles  they  perform,  and  the 
1  genetic diversity they contain"  .  The notion that biodiversity encompasses the variety of 

all  life  forms  highlights  the  importance  of  the  existence  of  individual  species.  The  diversity of life forms is apparent among the vast variety of species that are present on the  planet.  The working definition of biodiversity for the purposes of this thesis is based on  that  which  has  been stated  by  Wilcox.    Each  species  performs  specific  ecological  roles  and contributes to the fabric of ecological and genetic diversity to enable the functioning  of ecosystems.  The  species  concept  is  vital  to the  study  and  protection  of  biodiversity  (Wilson,  1993:  38).    Organisms  can  be  biologically  classified  as  being  members  of  the  same  species if they are genetically distinct from other species, and are potentially capable of  interbreeding and reproducing.  In other words, members of a single species are members  of  genetically  distinct  reproductive  communities  that  are  geographically  isolated  from  other  genetically  distinct  reproducing  communities  (Mallett,  1995  Townsend  et  al.,  2000: 59).  The variety of species aids in maintaining `biological integrity', wherein they

sustain the delicate balance and functional organization of the ecosystem which they are a  component  of  (Hughes  and  Nosh,  1992).    Individual  populations  of  species  will  shift,  adapt, or disappear, in response to environmental changes.  Hence, there is a necessity to  thoroughly  understand  and  protect  species  and  their  habitats  in  order  to  sustain  biodiversity and biological integrity.  Eminent  biologist  and  "dean"  of  biodiversity  studies,  E.O.  Wilson  (1988)  describes  a  vision  of  "biodiversity"  that  is  rooted  in  individual  species  but  is  expanded  holistically to entire life systems.  Intrinsic in this vision of biodiversity is the realization  that it is in danger, and once it disappears it is irreversible.  Wilson was the first scientist  to introduce the notion of a "biodiversity crisis" on a large scale.  Wilson (1993: 35) also  accentuates  the  importance  of  biodiversity  by  asserting  that  "the  variety  of  organisms,  from alleles (differing gene forms) to species, once lost, cannot be regained".  Every life  form  that  exists  within  an  ecosystem  performs  different  functions  and  contributes  to  various  ecosystem  services  that  aid  in  maintaining  the  system  over  time.  The  ultimate  response of ecosystems to a decline in biodiversity is not entirely known.  Some theories  are currently in existence.  Pioneering ecologists maintained that the stability of whole ecosystems is entirely  related to their diversity.  Prior to the 1970s, prominent ecologists such as Odum (1953),  MacArthur  (1955),  and  Elton  (1958)  subscribed  to  the  theory  that  increasing  diversity  contributes  to  the  stabilization  of  an  ecosystem.    This  is  also  known  as  the  diversity  stability relationship.  Charles Elton (1958) was the  first to clearly state and build upon  the  arguments  of  Odum  and  MacArthur.      Elton  stated  that  "simple  communities  were  more  easily  upset  than  richer  ones  that  is,  more  subject  to  destructive  oscillations  in  populations, and more vulnerable to invasions" (Elton 1958: 45).  Both Odum (1953) and  Elton (1958) similarly observed that more violent fluctuations in population density were  characteristic of simplified terrestrial communities as opposed to more stable population  density in diverse terrestrial communities.  For instance, it was found that invasions were  more  frequent  on  disturbed,  cultivated  land,  where  anthropogenic  activity  had  largely  simplified ecological communities (McCann, 2000: 228).  According to this theory, any  interruptions and deletions in the harmonious web of life has the possibility of disrupting

6 

natural  processes  and  bringing  about  devastating  negative  consequences  for  environmental, ecosystem, and human health (Suzuki, 2001).  MacArthur (1955) illustrated the importance of interconnections in food webs and  energy.    He  hypothesized  that  greater  `connectance'  is  a  driver  of  community  and  ecosystem stability.  A greater diversity of species within a food web causes an increase  in  the  number  of  energy  pathways,  strengthening  the  food  web  and  increasing  the  stability  of  the  system  (McCann,  2000:  228).    In  fact,  more  recently,  Romanuk  et  al.  (2006)  corroborated  MacArthur's  hypothesis  that  populations  that  are  present  in  a  food  web  with  greater  connectance,  and  consequentially  have  access  to  a  greater  range  of  resources,  are  more  stable  than  those  which  consume  a  more  restricted  range  of  resources.  This appears to be a further "benefit of high levels of species richness in food  webs" (Romanuk et al., 2006: 376).  In  1973,  Robert  May  challenged  the  diversitystability  theory.    He  used  mathematical  relationships  to  come  to the  conclusion  that  diversity  tends  to  destabilize  community  dynamics.    Hence,  he  hypothesized  that  diversity,  alone,  is  not  a  driver  of  stability (McCann, 2000: 228).  This notion tends to concur with the consensus that food  webs are a  complex of energetic pathways.   These webs do not rely  solely on diversity  for stability and support.  The energy present in the diverse pathways of the various food  webs  that  compose  the  fabric  of  complex  ecosystems  may  be  just  as  important  as  the  diversity present within each web (McCann, 2000: 232).  Ultimately, based on theory and empirical evidence, all ecologists have come to a  consensus  that  declines  in  diversity  should  "accelerate  the  simplification  of  ecological  communities"  (McCann,  2000:  228).    Conservation  of  biodiversity  is  a  very  important  aspect  for  the  preservation  of  ecosystem  function  and  health.    McCann  (2000:  233)  suggests that an ecosystem and its component species are to be preserved by proceeding  "as  if  each  species  is  sacred".    Also,  any  species  removals  (extinctions)  or  species  additions  (invasions)  "can,  and  eventually  will,  invoke  major  shifts  in  community  structure  and  dynamics",  and  the  repercussions  of  these  changes  are  unpredictable  (McCann, 2000: 233).  Notable  ornithologist,  Bridget  Stutchbury  (2007:  31)  stresses  the  importance  of  species  diversity  for  human  well  being  and  survival  and  maintains  that  "the  natural

7 

resources we use directly are supported by tens of thousands of species that we pay little  attention to".  The wellbeing of humankind is reliant on the existence of a vigorous level  of biodiversity, which promotes ecosystem health.  The 2005 United Nations Millennium  Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report estimates that 60 percent of the world's ecosystem  services have been degraded or used unsustainably (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,  2005:  1).    Since  only  about  15  percent  of  the  Earth's  biodiversity  and  the  interconnections  among  them  are  understood,  there  is  much  left  to  be  comprehended  (Suzuki  in  Beazley  and  Boardman,  2001:  vi).    A  complete  knowledge  of  the  repercussions  of  a  continued  loss  of  biodiversity  is  not  known.    There  is  a  general  consensus that there will be an onslaught of negative ramifications as genetic resources,  community  attributes,  and  ecosystem  properties  are  lost  forever  with  the  extinction  of  each  individual  species  (Van  Dyke,  2003:  80).    In  addition,  "the  impact  of  losing  a  species, or set of species, [...], depends on whether their role in the environment can be  filled  by  other  animals",  and  effectively  sustain  the  web  of  life  (Stutchbury,  2007:  31).  Relying  on  other  species  to  fill  the  void  left  by  extinct  species  is  effectively  a  gamble.  There may not always be species which are as well adapted as the extinct species were at  performing the specific ecological role. 

1.1.2 Value of Biodiversity and Species  The decision to protect biodiversity is defined by two major arguments.  It is a  debate that takes place on the philosophical and ethical front alongside the ecological and  political front.  Two major arguments for the protection of biodiversity exist.  Proponents  of either of these arguments insist that the current biodiversity crisis should be addressed  because the variety of life and diversity of species not only provide critical utility to  humans and entire ecosystems, they also hold much value in and of themselves.  Hence,  endangered species can be valued intrinsically or instrumentally (Beazley and Boardman,  2001: 13).  The  argument  to  preserve  endangered  species  based  on  intrinsic  value  is  essentially  a  call  for  conservation  based  on  inherent  worth.    Each  species  exists  as  a  product and continual process of evolution.  Each holds value in and of itself, regardless  of utility.  According to this level of worth, humans have a moral and ethical obligation to

8 

avoid interference with the right of other species to exist.  This is the biocentric, or life  centred view to preserving endangered species (Beazley and Boardman, 2001: 13).  The anthropocentric, or humancentred, view of conservation regards biodiversity  and species in terms of their instrumental value.  Endangered species are a portion of the  web that sustains life.  All species contribute to biodiversity of ecosystems.  The survival  of  humans  within  these  ecosystems  relies  on  the  continued  existence  of  biodiversity.  With the accelerated disappearance of endangered species from the web of life, the level  of biodiversity also decreases.  Hence, endangered species hold instrumental value.  The  anthropocentric  view  proposes  that  endangered  species  should  be  conserved  out  of  "enlightened selfinterest" (Beazley and Boardman, 2001: 13).  The  earlier  and  more  dominant  views  of  conservation  biology  tended  to  value  endangered species based on their inherent worth.  Conservationists have long argued and  championed  the  importance  of  preserving  biodiversity  based  on  the  intrinsic,  religious,  and  cultural  values  of  organisms.    More  recently,  the  United  Nations  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment of 2005  has  brought about a shift  in  scientific perception of the  fundamental role and value of biodiversity.  The important role that biodiversity plays in  offering ecosystem services and contributing to human well being is now being strongly  emphasized  (Mosquin,  2000:  108  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment,  2005  Ninan,  2009:  1).    Justification  of  actions  to  conserve  biodiversity  and  individual  species  no  longer lies mainly within the realm of conservation for solely spiritual and ethical reasons  and  the  right  of  a  species'  existence  independent  of  human  use.    As  mentioned  earlier,  this  concept,  which  encompasses  the  acknowledgment  of  value  in  something  in  and  of  itself, irrespective of it utility, is largely referred to as `intrinsic value'.  Ecosystem services that  species, biodiversity, and the web of  life provide on the  larger  scale  are  presently  being  emphasized  in  addition  to the  intrinsic  value  argument.  People  tend  to  value  ecosystems  based  on  consideration  of  their  own  benefit  and  well  being  in  some respects, and  based on  intrinsic  value  in other respects (Ninan, 2009: 1).  This  added  facet  to  the  importance  of  biodiversity  protection  arises  from  the  interconnections  between  people,  biodiversity,  and  ecosystems.    Anthropogenic  activity  impacts biodiversity and ecosystems both directly and indirectly.  The ecosystem services  that  they  provide  to  humans  are  greatly  affected,  consequently  resulting  in  impacts  on

9 

overall  human  wellbeing  (ibid).    It  is  imperative  to  note  that  other  natural  factors  independent  of  anthropogenic  activity  may  influence  biodiversity  and  ecosystems,  and  that other factors not necessarily associated with changes in biodiversity and ecosystems  can  affect  human  conditions  (Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment,  2005:  vviii  Ninan,  2009: 1).  Nonetheless, the loss of biodiversity and the corresponding ecosystem services  that  biodiversity  provides  is  one  of  the  greatest  threats  to  humanity.    The  argument  to  promote  biodiversity  protection  is  thus  supported  based  on  both  the  case  for  species'  valuable  contributions  to  human  needs  and  survival  as  well  as  the  ethical  case  for  conservation  based  on  inherent  value.    As  such,  conservation  of  biodiversity  must  be  taken seriously on all fronts, at local, subnational, national, and global levels (ibid.).  The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment identifies four main facets of ecosystem  services  that  contribute  to  human  wellbeing.    They  include  provisioning,  regulating,  cultural, and supporting services.  Examples of provisioning services include food, water,  timber, and fibre provisioning.  Regulating services include the controlling and buffering  of  climate,  floods,  disease,  wastes,  and  water  quality.    Cultural  services  encompass  recreation,  aesthetic  enjoyment,  and  spiritual  fulfillment.    Natural  supporting  services  include soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling, to name a few.  Human well  being as defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment refers to material welfare and  livelihoods alongside security, resiliency, social relations, health, and freedom of choice  and action.  The loss of biodiversity affects the critical ecosystem services that ultimately  sustain  human  life  and  human  wellbeing  (Mosquin,  2000  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment, 2005: vviii Ninan, 2009: 2).  In  essence,  biodiversity  is  important  to  humans  because  it  holds  ecological,  economic, and cultural values.  The importance of maintaining biodiversity and theories  of the web of  life  have  been thoroughly discussed.  Ecologically,  human beings rely on  healthy levels of biodiversity to sustain food webs and maintain systems of life support.  The  economic  importance  of  biodiversity  is  very  extensive.    Essentially,  biodiversity  provides  humans  with  the  necessities  of  life  and  forms  the  basis  for  the  economy.    All  that  is  purchased  and  sold  commercially  originates  from  the  natural  world.    Some  examples  include  medicinal  ingredients  and  remedies,  forest  products,  agricultural  products, fishing, and recreational activities.  Culturally, humans are biologically attached

10 

to  nature  and  inspired  by  its  intrinsic  beauty.    Every  culture  makes  use  of  natural  attributes  and  species  to  give  symbolic  meaning  to  human  tradition  and  society.    For  example,  the  bald  eagle  is  extensively  used  as  a  symbol  of  freedom.    A  well  known  example of this is the national significance given to the Bald Eagle in the United States  (Mosquin, 2000 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005: 610). 

1.2 The Global Biodiversity Crisis  Most  scientists  estimate  the  total  number  of  species  on  the  planet  to  range  between  10  and  20  million  (Wilson,  1992:  132).    Only  about  1.5  million  species  have  been  identified,  named,  and  classified.    However,  species  that  have  been  thoroughly  studied, whose detailed biological information is known and whose life history traits are  understood are  much  less  in  number.  Less than  1 percent of all species that have  been  classified  are  well  understood  (Suzuki,  2001:  vi  Wilson,  1992:  346).    Vertebrates  are  welldocumented organisms when compared to invertebrates and plants and fungi, which  compose the vast majority of species on the planet (Cooney and Dickson, 2005: 3).  Although extinction is a natural process and massive extinction events have taken  place in the past, the present rate of extinction has reached crisis proportions worldwide  (Wilson,  1992:  243259  Lindenmyer  and  Burgman,  2005:  154).    Scientists  have  only  been able to estimate various predictions of species loss.  Some estimates predict a loss of  a  minimum of 0.25 to 0.50 percent of all  species  per decade.  However, scientists warn  that these estimates are conservative, merely due to what little is understood about all the  species  in  existence  (Lindenmyer  and  Burgman,  2005:  156).    Evidence  suggests  that  current  extinction  rates  are  substantially  higher  than  the  "background"  rate  at  which  species  have disappeared due to natural evolutionary processes  in the past (Lindenmyer  and Burgman, 2005: 157).  High extinction rates, alongside accelerating species invasion  rates  due  to  increased  globalization  in  a  modern  world,  place  ecosystems  under  great  stress.   Thus,  it  is crucial to understand  how the  loss of  species or the addition of  non  native species influences the stability and function of the ecosystems that humans rely on  for survival.  The  current  extinction  crisis  is  defined  by  the  disappearance  of  thousands  of  species from the planet on a daily basis.  Scientists are calling this phenomenon "the sixth

11 

great extinction" because species are going extinct at a faster rate than they have since the  dinosaurs disappeared (Suzuki, 2001 Ninan, 2009: xvii).  Although there is much uncertainty as to the number of species that currently exist on  the planet as well as the actual  current rates of extinction, causes of species extinctions  are  attributed  to  anthropogenic  actions.    Even so,  exact  causes  are  difficult  to  pinpoint.  Anthropogenic  action  is  defined  in  the  Canadian  Oxford  Dictionary  as  anything  that  is  "caused  by  human  activity",  such  as  anthropogenic  environmental  damage.    While  the  overharvesting  of  organisms,  pollution,  invasive  species,  and  climate  change  are  all  factors  that  have  negatively  affected  biodiversity  worldwide,  the  alteration,  fragmentation,  and  disappearance  of  habitat  are  the  primary  anthropogenic  threats  to  biodiversity  (Wilson,  1988:  3  Wilson,  1992:  253  Sisk  et  al.,  1994  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment,  2005:  15  David  Suzuki  Foundation,  2009b).    The  latter  is  a  crucial factor in the decline of the four species at risk case studies that are the subject of  this thesis. 

1.3  Uncertainty  and  Precaution  in  Species  at  Risk  Policy  and  the  Need  for  Local  Solutions  The  biodiversity  crisis  is  occurring  on  a  global  scale,  across  the  entire  planet  (Wilson, 1992).  However, it is impossible to attempt to resolve the issue on such a vast  scale.    The  problem  can  only  be  tackled  effectively  at  national  and  subnational,  or  provincial levels.  Localized responses can ultimately be more effective means to protect  and  manage species at risk.  In addition,  legal tools apply within a defined  jurisdiction.  Across  jurisdictions,  the  efforts  of  other  stakeholders  such  as  nongovernmental  organizations, voluntary stewards, and private landowners are also crucial elements in the  effort to protect species at risk.  Since there  is a great deal of uncertainty  in the actual dimensions of the current  biodiversity crisis, and  scientists are the  most thoroughly  informed on the causes of the  crisis, it is recommended that scientific knowledge should inform the basis of species at  risk  policy  and  law.  Science  alone  cannot  protect  species  at  risk  because  it  lacks  enforcement powers that have the potential to affect human behaviour.  Law, on the other  hand, can have an impact on human behaviour via the enforcement of norms, as it is the

12 

only  way  to  enforce  changes  in  behaviour  via  legal  sanctions.    Anthropogenic  actions  have  accelerated  extinction  rates  and  human  behaviour  is  linked  to  species  extinctions  (Sisk  et  al.,  1994  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment,  2005:  15).    Since  science,  by  itself, does not have the legal power to effect changes via the enforcement of norms, legal  and policy tools are essential.  There  is  substantial  uncertainty  among  the  scientific  community  as  to  the  potential  longterm  impacts of  losses of particular species on ecosystems (Myers, 1993  Hector  et  al.,  2001:  625).    Since  there  will  always  be  a  certain  amount  of  uncertainty  present,  the  precautionary  principle  is  crucially  important  for  addressing  problems  of  endangered species (Hector et al., 2001).  The precautionary principle  is a  fairly recent  policy and regulatory instrument.  It has emerged as a guide for law, policy, management,  and decisionmaking, where uncertainty is involved.  The  precautionary  principle  encompasses  the  premise  that  absolute  certainty  regarding an environmental  harm  must not be a prerequisite  for taking action to stop it.  In  other  words,  if  there  is  no  absolute  certainty  that  specific  actions  will  impart  heavy  burdens  on  future  generations,  but  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  they  may,  then  the  specific  action should  not take place (Folke et al., 1993: 63).  The principle  is  in direct  opposition to the presumption that all activities should take place until there is evidence  that the activities are causing harm.  The principle also advocates action to anticipate and  prevent  environmental  harm,  even  in  the  absence  of  scientific  proof  that  the  action  is  necessary.    The  precautionary  principle  is  present  in  many  international  environmental  treaties, such as the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, which is briefly discussed  in Chapter 3.  It is also present in some Canadian federal and provincial statutes, such as 
2  Canada's federal Species at Risk Act  , discussed at length in Chapter 3, which advocates a 

precautionary  approach  to  protection  of  species  at  risk  on  the  basis  of  Canada's  ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Cooney and Dickson, 2005: 45,  159).  Justification for the application of the precautionary principle within the realm of  biodiversity  has  been  also  advocated  by  Norman  Myers  (1993).    Myers  states  that  the  precautionary  principle  applies  to  biodiversity  more  than  any  other  environmental

problem  because of serious concerns of adverse repercussions on  biological, ecological,  economic,  and  other  levels.    The  possible  repercussions  of  biodiversity  degradation  warrant  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  policy  initiatives  that  take  biodiversity  protection into account (Myers, 1993: 74). 

1.4 Importance of Biodiversity in Canada  Biodiversity  is  important  because  it  encompasses  ecological  or  indirect  utility  economic or direct utility and cultural values alongside intrinsic value based on inherent  worth  and  the  basic  right  of existence  of  all  life  forms.    Ecologically,  the  entire  planet  relies on the  integrity of  biodiversity to sustain  food webs and  maintain  systems of  life  support within  ecosystems.  In essence,  biodiversity also sustains  human existence, and  human beings extract indirect utility or benefit from the variety of all life forms (Wilson,  1988 Wilson, 1992 Mosquin, 2000 Townsend et al., 2000: 338 Millennium Ecosystem  Assessment, 2005: 610).  Biodiversity provides indirect benefits to humankind by supplying the necessities  of  life and  it also  forms the  basis  for the economy.   Remarkable amounts of goods that  are purchased and sold commercially originate from the natural world.  Some examples  include  medicinal  ingredients  and  remedies,  forest  products,  agricultural  products,  fishing,  and  recreational  activities  (Wilson,  1988  Wilson,  1992  Mosquin,  2000  Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005: 610).  On  the  national  front,  some  of  the  economic  development  in  Canada  is  reliant  upon  the  biodiversity  that  is  a  constituent  of  the  country's  natural  landscape.    The  Canadian economy is mainly a staples economy that is mostly driven by natural resource  extraction.    Although  mining,  oil  and  gas  extraction,  forest  fibre  extraction,  aggregate  extraction,  and  agriculture  are  not  as  greatly  reliant  upon  biodiversity,  the  health  of  the  country's  fishing  industry  is  contingent  upon  the  integrity  of  ecological  systems  and  biodiversity.    For  instance,  over  the  last  three  decades  marine  and  other  wildlife  stocks  have  declined  rapidly  (Hessing  et  al.,  2005:  272273).    Forestry  related  industries  and  agriculture  contribute  to  the  loss  of  genetic  diversity  through  the  promotion  of  monocultures.    Reforestation  failures  in  oldgrowth  stands  in  British  Columbia  are  rampant,  depleting  species  and  habitat  diversity  (Bocking,  1999:  21).    Aquaculture  is  a

14 

human activity that is affecting the biodiversity of fish, mostly by the accidental release  of unfit fish or nonnative strains that hybridize with native populations, decreasing their  genetic diversity and vigour (Norris et al., 1999 Redpath Museum, n.d.).  In  addition,  an  indication  of  the  economic  importance  of  recreational  activities  resulting from biodiversity and affinity with nature in Canada can be noted in the results  of a 1991 Statistics Canada survey on the `Importance of Wildlife to Canadians'.  Results  from  the  survey  indicate  that  nearly  nineteen  million  Canadians  spent  over  five  billion  dollars  while  partaking  in  wildliferelated  activities  (Filion  et  al.,  1994).    In  1995,  Resource  Futures  International  reported  similar  amounts  (almost  $5.6  billion).    With  specific reference to endangered species,  it  is reported that "net benefit to Canadians of  wildliferelated  activities  involving  endangered  mammals  and  birds"  could  be  $40  million per year.  The amount would be much higher in present circumstances as it would  have  to  be  adjusted  for  inflation.    Also,  the  amount  does  not  account  for  endangered  species other than mammals and birds (RFI, 1995: 24 Gray et al., 2003).  As  the  Canadian  government  has  not  made  it  a  priority  to  update  this  data  and 
3  surveys  on  the  matter  have  not  been  conducted  since  ,  it  can  be  assumed  that the  same 

trends  have  upheld,  with  affinity  towards  nature  and  wildlife  continuing  to  remain  an  integral  part  of  the  `Canadian  identity'  and  continuing  to  be  embedded  within  the  Canadian economy.  One would expect that since Canadians evidence concern for nature  in surveys and public opinion research (Amos et al., 2001: 144146), Canada would have  strong policy tools in place for protecting species at risk.  The effectiveness of these tools  is a fundamental focus of this thesis. 

1.5 Biodiversity Challenges in Canada  Habitat loss has been attributed as the number one threat to over 80 percent of  Canada's species at risk (Elgie, 2009: 211).  Measures of the state of current biodiversity  in  the  country  include  the  condition  of  genetic  and  species  diversity,  ecosystems,  and  ecological  functions  and  processes  (Mosquin,  2000:  59).    A  survey  of  Canada's  taxonomic  biodiversity conducted by Ted Mosquin  in the early 1990s,  including groups  in  marine  regions,  revealed  that  Canada  has  an  estimated  140,000  species,  with  only

15 

70,000  having  been  identified  and  known  to  science  (Mosquin,  2000:  63).    Of  great  concern are also the  loss of genetic diversity and the pool of unique and rigorous genes  among  species  in  Canada.    This  is  especially  evident  in  the  agriculture  and  forest  fibre  industries,  where  oldgrowth  forests  have  been  replaced  with  genetically  redundant  monocultures  (Mosquin,  2000:  61).    Negative  trends  are  emerging  in  biodiversity  in  Canada.  With  regards  to  species  at  risk  in  Canada,  as  outlined  in  Table  1.1,  as  of  November 2010, 617 species were considered to be at risk however, the actual number is  thought  to  be  much  higher  (Suzuki,  2001  Illical  and  Harrison,  2007:  367  COSEWIC,  2010).  Thus, the biodiversity crisis is also very severe on the home front.

1.6 Canadian Legal Tools for the Protection of Species at Risk  Despite  the  presence  of  scientific  uncertainty  in  the  biodiversity  crisis,  much  information  is  known  about  certain  species  in  Canada.  Individual  species  case  studies,  analyzed  in  depth  in  Chapter  5  and  Chapter  7,  serve  to  highlight  the  importance  of

16 

scientific information in the creation and implementation of species at risk policy.  This  thesis  focuses on  four specific case studies that have  been  very well studied  in order to  conduct an interpretive qualitative evaluation of the legal protection of species at risk in  Canada.    The  motivation  behind  the  focus  of  case  studies  for  the  evaluation  of  legal  species at risk protection in Canada is the present lack of case study literature that focuses  on provincial  measures  in conjunction with  federal  measures.  Canadian  lawyer Stewart  Elgie has comprehensively analysed the federal jurisdiction with regards to species at risk  protection  (Elgie,  2003  Elgie,  2009).    Case  studies  that  are  the  subject  matter  of  this  thesis highlight legal protection measures at the provincial level of jurisdiction as well as  the federal level, with particular consideration of the fact that the provincial jurisdiction  plays a very important role in the protection of Canada's species at risk, a matter that will  also be discussed in this paper.  Case studies are also an effective method of evaluating  legal  measures  for  protecting  species  at  risk  because  the  knowledge  that  exists  about  certain wellstudied species is enough to facilitate the pursuit of effective protection, with  the  proper  legal  tools  and  sufficient  political  will.  In  the  Canadian  context, there  are  a  range of  legal tools available  for protecting species at risk. These tools  include:  federal  and  provincial  statutes  and  regulations  species  listing  processes  critical  habitat  identification and recovery plans.  Chapter  3  outlines  the  existing  legal  tools  for  protecting  species  at  risk  at  the  federal  level  and  their  shortcomings.    Since  jurisdiction  is  a  crucial  component  for  the  effective implementation of species at risk protection in Canada, the central contribution  of  this  thesis  consists  of  a  comparison  of  the  legal  tools  provided  by  the  provinces  of  British  Columbia and Ontario.  The provinces were selected  for study as they  are often  compared in the legal and policy literatures and they contain the highest identified levels  of species at risk among all the regions in Canada.  The rationales for the selection of the  two provinces are elaborated on in Chapter 2.  After setting out the main legal tools for  Ontario  in  Chapter  4,  there  are  two  case  studies  from  Ontario  in  Chapter  5.    The  main  legal tools for British Columbia are addressed in Chapter 6, while two case studies from  British  Columbia  are  encompassed  in  Chapter  7.    The  rationales  for  the  selection  of  species  at  risk  case  studies  are  outlined  in  Chapter  2.   Vertebrate  species  were  selected  because  of  access  to  available  data.    Also,  all  species  selected  for  study  are  indicator

17 

species  whose  health  and  existence  are  indicators  of  the  health  of  their  habitats  and  environs.  In  the  case  of  the  legal  tools  available  in  Ontario,  where  there  is  dedicated  endangered species legislation at the provincial level, the Endangered Species Act, 2007,  Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations (ENGOs) are pushing  for the abolition  of exemptions that undermine the provisions of the Act.  In British Columbia, ENGOs are  pushing  for  the  establishment  of  dedicated  endangered  species  legislation which  should  be generally  modeled after the Ontario law.  Jurisdictions can draw policy  lessons  from  one another on the basis of successful solutions to defined issues.  In  essence,  there  is  a  requirement  for  more  effective  management  tools  for  the  problem of biodiversity loss and species at risk.  These tools must be rooted in scientific  understanding  about the  specific  causes  of  species  decline  and  the  habitat  requirements  for the recovery of species in decline.  Sciencebased policy, legal, and management tools  following  a  precautionary  approach  must  be  implemented  at  both  the  federal  and  provincial levels for more effective management of species at risk in Canada.  The  recommendations  resulting  from  the  scrutiny  of  existing  legal  tools  and  original legal documents as well as the evaluation of legal inadequacies are elaborated in  Chapter  8.    Emerging  themes  include  the  importance  of  interjurisdictional  and  intra  jurisdictional  cooperation  for  effective  species  at  risk  policy  the  judicious  and  scientifically  informed  use  of  flexibility  instruments  such  as  permits  and  exemptions  to  existing  law  and  the  importance  of  funding  private  landowner  stewardship  efforts.  Scientific information and the proper definition of critical recovery habitat for species at  risk alongside the importance of using a precautionary approach are also discussed.  The  research  methodology  of  this  thesis  is  rooted  in  interpretive  qualitative  evaluation techniques, via the close scrutiny of legal documents to obtain qualitative data  so  as  to  evaluate  their  effectiveness  (Patton,  2002:  412).    Case  studies  also  served  to  highlight the qualitative data.  Methodologies will now be discussed in Chapter 2.

CHAPTER 2.0 METHODS  The  research  method  for  this  thesis  was  based  on  an  interpretive  qualitative  evaluative method (Patton, 2002: 10).  Patton (2002: 10) describes the particular research  method  that  was  used  for  this  thesis  as  qualitative  `program  evaluation'.    The  effectiveness  of  policy  tools  and  legal  measures,  also  known  as  qualitative  data,  was  evaluated based on their ability to achieve the goals of species at risk protection.  After  close  scrutiny  and  reading  of  legal  documents,  the  implementation  of  species  at  risk  protectionist policy  goals was analyzed and their  effectiveness  for the  management and  preservation  of  species  at  risk  in  Canada  were  assessed.    The  policy  tools  and  legal  measures available at the federal level have been much studied (Amos et al., 2001 Elgie,  2003  Illical  and  Harrison,  2007  Elgie,  2009),  but  there  are  significant  gaps  in  the  literature with respect to the provincial level.  Evaluation case studies are pertinent to the application of interpretive qualitative  evaluative research.  This method of research emphasizes the integration of case studies. 
4  The  method  is  often  used  in  legal  evaluation  and  policy  analysis  .   The  purpose  of  this 

method  is  to  amass  information  and  generate  findings  that  are  useful  based  on  the  information.    By  understanding  individual  case  studies,  processes  and  outcomes  of  the  `program',  or  the  effectiveness  of  the  legal  tools,  can  be  more  readily  understood.  Implementation gaps can be more easily identified when legal tools are evaluated on the  basis  of  their  effectiveness  at  protecting  individual  species  on  a  casebycase  basis.  Recommendations for improvement can be more easily pinpointed and suggested (Patton,  2002: 10).  At the outset of this thesis, a substantial portion of Canadian environmental policy 
5  literature  was  initially  consulted  .    A  focus  on  species  at  risk  policy  was  emphasized. 

Case  study  research  is  well  established  in  scientific,  social  science,  policy,  and  legal  research.    Case  studies  are  a  substantial  portion  of  this  thesis  as  well.    Some  recent  examples  of  case  studies  illustrating  biodiversity  and  species  integrity  as  a  policy  challenge within the Canadian context are contained in case study anthologies edited by  Gore and Stoett (2009) and VanNijnatten and Boardman (2009).  The main biodiversity

case  studies  in  Gore  and  Stoett (2009)  emphasize  local  solutions  to  global  problems  in  biodiversity and only two species case studies are evaluated:  polar bears in the Canadian  Arctic  and  salmon  aquaculture  issues  in  British  Columbia.    Bocking  (2009:  1337)  identifies  the  importance  of  biodiversity  in  terms  of  various  Canadian  values  and  perspectives,  in  relation  to  economic  repercussions  and  the  management  of  resources  such as forests and fish all the while protecting the integrity of species and habitats.  The  only case study  in  VanNijnatten and Boardman (2009), Elgie (2009: 197212) analyzes  the very long process that was undertaken for the creation of the federal Species at Risk  Act, with a  very  limited portion of the study dedicated to the current policy situation at  the federal level of government.  The  first  portion  of  the  research  methodology  that  is  the  basis  of  this  thesis  encompassed the complete review of original legal documents and existing legal tools for  the protection of species at risk in Canada.  Documents including provincial and federal  statutes  and  regulations  as  well  as  species  recovery  strategies  and  management  plans  were thoroughly scrutinized.  A statute is defined in standard dictionary definitions (such  as  the  Canadian  Oxford  Dictionary)  as  "a  decree  or  enactment  passed  by  a  legislative  body,  and  expressed  in  a  formal  document".      A  regulation  is  defined  in  the  Canadian  Oxford Dictionary as "a prescribed rule or an authoritative direction, often appearing as a  subordinate form of legislation that may be established without the necessity of enacting  a  new  statute".    Regulations  have  legal  clout  yet  are  different  from  legislation  because  they  are  appendages  to  existing  legislation  that  essentially  modify  existing  statutes  in  efforts to avoid enacting entirely new legislation.  The statutes and regulations that were  closely examined and evaluated are those that specifically address species at risk or that 
6  7  affect  species  at  risk  .    Press  releases,  documents,  and  report  cards  published  by 

6 

Statutes examined and evaluated include the federal Species at Risk Act the Ontario Endangered Species  Act, 2007 the BC Wildlife Act, the Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act, and the BC Forest and  Range Practices Act.  Regulations evaluated include Ontario Regulation 242/08 under the Endangered  Species Act, 2007 and BC Government Actions Regulation 17/04 under the Forest and Range Practices  Act.  Specific species' recovery strategies were also analyzed.  7  Documents evaluated include the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario's Report on the Ontario  Endangered Species Act, 2007 (February 2009), which is available here:  http://www.eco.on.ca/eng/index.php/pubs/ecopublications/thelastlineofdefense.php and the Nature  Canada report card on the performance of the Species at Risk Act (April 2009), which is available here:  http://www.naturecanada.ca/endangered_atrisk_saraRC2009.asp

prominent  Canadian  Environmental  NonGovernmental  Organizations  were  also 
8  evaluated  .    In  addition  contemporary  textbooks  on  Canadian  environmental  law  were  9  extensively reviewed  as well as prominent cases that were brought to the Federal Court 

of Appeal.  The most prominent case in the thesis is that of the Spotted Owl, as well as  litigation resulting from applications for judicial review of the Species at Risk Act for the 
10  Greater SageGrouse and the Nooksack Dace  . 

Since science and policy often intersect in environmental law, scientific literature 
11  on biodiversity  was  also  reviewed  .    An  investigation  of  the  current  biodiversity  crisis 

led  to the  realization  that  a  case  study  approach  was  required  to  specifically  assess  the  consequences of current legal measures for species at risk.  The  case  studies  focused  on  four  endangered  vertebrate  species  and  include  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  (Lanius  ludovicianus  migrans),  Jefferson  Salamander  (Ambystoma jeffersonianum), Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  (Marmota  vancouverensis).    Two  species  from  Ontario  and  two  from  British  Columbia  are  token  examples  of  species  at  risk  in  Canada.    The  case  studies  are  highlighted  to  garner  insight  into  the  degree  of  protection  that  exists  at  the  level of  federal  and provincial  jurisdictions.  They also provide  insight  into the efficacy  of  this  protection.    Each  species  is  analyzed  in  various  contexts.    First,  differences  in  species  protection  based  on  ecological  and  life  history  traits  were  evaluated.  Subsequently, the protection granted to each species allows comparison of two different  types  of  provincial  endangered  species  protection:    dedicated  endangered  species  legislation  versus  legislation that  is  not specifically dedicated to endangered species  yet  includes minor provisions to account for endangered species protection.  The case studies  illustrate  how  both  types  of  provincial  endangered  species  protection  measures  work  in  tandem with the federal level of protection, as well as their effectiveness.

The  research  stresses  the  importance  of  the  case  study  approach  in  light  of  the  interpretive  qualitative  evaluative  method.    Legal  and  policy  tools  for  species  at  risk  protection  were  reviewed  and  analytically  assessed.    For  instance,  federal  tools  and  the  Species  at  Risk  Act  are  described  in  Chapter  3,  while  the  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007  is  discussed  in  depth  in  Chapter  4,  alongside  other  important  species  at  risk  management  and  legal  tools.    Although  British  Columbia  lacks  dedicated  endangered  species  legislation,  statutes  that  affect  species  at  risk  are  described  in  Chapter  6  along  with other legal measures.  After evaluating the existing legal measures via the case study  method, conclusions were drawn and policy recommendations for changes or reforms are  provided on the basis of the analysis.  The recommendations are found in Chapter 8, and  stress the importance of interjurisdictional and intrajurisdictional cooperation as well as  the benefit of dedicated species at risk legislation at both federal and provincial levels of  jurisdiction and private landowner cooperation. 

2.1  Rationale  for  the  Selection  of  British  Columbia  and  Ontario  as  Comparator  Provinces  As previously mentioned, a major component of this research investigation is the  selection  of  British  Columbia  and  Ontario  as  comparator  provincial  jurisdictions.    Two  case  study  species  were  chosen  from  each  province.    Ontario  was  selected  because  the  Ontario Endangered Species Act, 2007 is considered to be the best example of species at  risk legislation in the country.  Given the lack of extensive species at risk legal tools and  dedicated  legislation,  British  Columbia  was  also  selected  as  a  comparator  province.  Both provinces also contain the highest identified levels of species at risk among  all the regions in Canada, according to Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife  in  Canada  (COSEWIC).    Currently  there  are  617  species  identified  as  being  at  risk  in  Canada.    British  Columbia  is  home  to  202 of  these  species,  while  205  of  these  species  reside in Ontario (COSEWIC, 2010).  Similarities in number of species at risk in the two  provinces also allow them to be useful comparators in the realm of species at risk policy  in  Canada.    The  similarities  between  the  two  provinces  permit  each  provincial  jurisdiction to draw lessons from the other.  It is for these reasons that species from these  two provinces were selected for case study in this investigation.

24 

2.2 Rationale for the Selection of Case Study Subjects:  Vertebrate Species at Risk  Vertebrates  were  selected  not  because  they  are  the  most  important  species  in  existence  with  regards  to  ecosystem  contribution,  but  because  there  is  a  greater  availability of  information which provides access to comparators  for research purposes.  Charismatic  vertebrates  are  used  as  comparators  because  their  aesthetic  and  cultural  appeal  garners  more  interest  and  as  a  result  allows  more  attention  and  funding  to  be  diverted toward their study (Wilson, 1993: 49).  The  Northern  Spotted  Owl  and  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  are  both  charismatic  vertebrate species that were chosen because there is more scientific data and information  available on these  more aesthetically popular species.  These species obtain the greatest  amount  of  funding  that  can  in  turn  allow  for  population  surveys  and  species  health  assessments.    Policy  research  can  only  be  compiled  on  the  basis  of  availability  and  accessibility of information.  It is for this reason that charismatic vertebrate species that  cultivate  popular  appeal  among  nongovernmental  organization  (NGO)  campaigns,  as  well as the general public, and in turn appeal to governments, are the subjects of the case  studies in this thesis.  Both the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike and the Jefferson Salamander  have  been  the  subject  of  minor  NGO  campaigns  and  exist  as  very  important  indicator  species  of  the  health  of  the  sensitive  and  densely  populated  southern  Ontario  and  Greenbelt region.  Both Ontario cases have some degree of charismatic appeal as they are  the subject of public NGO campaigns, albeit not as large a scale as the British Columbia  case  studies.    In  addition,  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  is  a  species  that  was  legally  protected under Ontario's first piece of species at risk legislation, the Endangered Species  Act, 1971.  A comparison of similarities and differences of legal protection in the original  Act and the new Act is juxtaposed in this thesis.  As  a  result  of  the  evaluation  of  legal  tools  and  selective  case  study  analysis,  conclusions were drawn and policy recommendations were made for possible future legal  changes and reforms.  These recommendations are outlined in Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 3.0 FEDERAL LEGAL MEASURES FOR SPECIES AT RISK IN  CANADA  Those  who  wish  to  ensure  the  effective  protection  of  species  at  risk  continually  turn their attention to legal measures. Legal tools for the protection of biodiversity have  the  considerable  advantage  of  enforcement  measures.  In  the  chapters  that  follow,  the  impacts of the presence and absence of  legal tools at the provincial  level are examined.  In this chapter, the central focus is on setting the stage for scrutiny of the provincial tools,  by  indicating  what  is  available  at  the  federal  level  and  explaining  why  the  tools  at  the  federal  level  are  insufficient.    Then,  the  nature  of  jurisdiction  in  Canada  and  how  it  affects species at risk protection is briefly described.  Legal species at risk protection  is  not immune to jurisdictional matters.  Subsequently, the focus  is turned to the influence  of international law upon Canadian law, and followed with a discussion of legal tools and  of the key federal legal tool, the Species at Risk Act.  The extent of the current biodiversity crisis spans the entire globe.  However, it is  impossible to attempt to resolve the crisis at such a  large scale.  Legal tools to mitigate  the biodiversity crisis only take effect at the national and subnational level.  In the early  1990s, when the biodiversity crisis was acknowledged to be a serious global problem, the  international  community  mobilized  to  establish  international  norms.    International  law  exerts influences on federal law, and obligates the federal government to implement legal  measures  for  the  protection  of  endangered  and  threatened  species.    The  influence  of  international  law  led  to  the  creation  of  the  federal Species  at  Risk  Act  (SARA)  in  2002  (Gore and Stoett, 2009: 2023 Greenbaum and Wellingon, 2010: 374378).  However, prior to the passage of the Act, various federal laws for environmental  protection were in place.  None of those laws was specifically dedicated to species at risk  protection, leaving a void in the federal protection of species at risk.  Species at risk were  acknowledged and listed by way of a decision making process by the Committee on the  Status  of  Endangered  Wildlife  in  Canada  (COSEWIC),  which  was  founded  in  1978.  Prior to the enactment of SARA, the results of the process did not have any legal effect.  The  Recovery  of  Nationally  Endangered  Wildlife  (RENEW)  committee,  established  in  1988,  was  also  in  existence  prior  to  SARA.    Its  purpose  was  to  establish  recovery  strategies  for  endangered  or  threatened  species  as  listed  under  COSEWIC.    For  many

27 

years,  these  policy  tools  had  no  legal  clout.    Canadian  endangered  species  law  was  in  great need of improvement if protectionist measures were to become legally binding, and  subject to  enforcement  measures.    Nonetheless,  even  with  the  recognition  of  the  urgent  need  for  species  at  risk  legislation  at  the  federal  level,  conflicting  stakeholder  interests  created  challenges  and  a  long  time  passed  before  an  adequate  compromise  could  be  reached  (Amos  et  al.,  2001:  139  Elgie,  2009).    The  main  elements  of  SARA  will  be  discussed in this chapter.  Even  though  the  Species  at  Risk  Act  has  been  in  existence  for  9  years,  its  implementation  over  the  previous  years  has  been  viewed  as  insufficient  for  protecting  species at risk.  Many environmental nongovernmental organizations such as the David  Suzuki  Foundation,  Ecojustice,  Environmental  Defence,  and  Nature  Canada  have  been  successful  in  emphasizing  its  shortcomings  (Nature  Canada,  2009).    Litigation  for  judicial review  has recently played a crucial role  in outlining  inadequacies  in  species at  risk protection (Valiante, 2009: 4445).  The Act's shortcomings will be described in this  chapter alongside recommendations for further reform. 

3.1 The Institutional Composition of Canadian Environmental Law and Policy  The  present  responsibility  of  various  levels  of  government  with  respect  to  environmental issues is rooted in the division of jurisdictional powers between the federal  and provincial governments that was originally outlined in the British North America Act,  1867  (BNA,  1867).    As  set  out  in  the  Act,  provincial  governments  are  responsible  for  natural resources, public lands and forests, and mines and minerals.  Fisheries, aboriginal  matters,  interprovincial  and  international  transport,  as  well  as  regulation  of  trade  and  commerce, are under the  jurisdiction of the  federal government.  Although this division  of powers was intended to be clear and precise, there is a history of jurisdictional conflict  with respect to environmental issues, as the environment is not clearly defined within the  constitution.  These problems persisted even after the repatriation of the constitution from  Britain to Canada in 1982 (the Canada Act, 1982) (Rogers and Wilkinson, 2000: 191).  Jurisdictional  responsibilities  were  originally  outlined  for  the  purposes  of  economic  expansion,  growth,  and  development.    In  an  era  of  concern  for  sustainable  development  and  biodiversity  preservation,  jurisdictional  conflict  exists  with  regard  to

28 

environmental  issues.    The  reason  is  that  environmental  problems  flow  from  one  jurisdiction  to  the  other,  generating  issues  that  require  coordination  and  consultation  among the various branches of government and all the various stakeholders.  This results  in  what  has  been  coined  "jurisdictional  gridlock"  within  the  Canadian  environmental  policy  process  (Rogers  and  Wilkinson,  2000:  192).    In  other  words,  "jurisdictional  gridlock"  results  from  conflicting  jurisdictional  claims  between  different  government  jurisdictions, impeding the resolution of problems (ibid.).  Jurisdictional conflict is intrinsic to Canadian law as a result of the distribution of  heads of power in the Canadian constitution.  Issues pertaining to the environment can be  found at every  level of  jurisdiction.   For this reason, environmental policy can  be quite  messy.  The  imprecise  definition  of  the  environment  and  the  responsibility  of 

jurisdictions  within  the  Canadian  constitution  has  a  vast  influence  on  the  Canadian  environmental  policy  process,  and  ultimately,  on  environmental  law  within  various  jurisdictions.  The influence of international law upon domestic law is also an important  factor  in  the  outcome  of  environmental  law  and  policy  in  Canada,  specifically  at  the  federal level of jurisdiction.  These influences are described in section 3.2. 

3.2 Influences of International Law upon Canadian Law  International law is influential because it impacts the behaviour of countries at the  national level.  States respect it and "regard it as law" (Muldoon, 2003: 608).  Events and  actions in the international system can have a major impact on the activities of domestic  states depending on the adoption of  international  law  into domestic  law (Hessing et al.,  2005:  85).    It  cannot  have  any  effect  unless  it  is  transformed  into  domestic  law.    In  Canada, this usually occurs in the form of legislation (Currie, 2001: 199200).  When  countries  sign  international  treaties,  they  commit  themselves  to  enacting  domestic  legislation  to  implement  the  obligations  contained  in  the  treaty.    In  Canada,  only  the  federal  government  has  the  authority  to  enter  into treaties,  and  yet  the  federal  government is limited to passing implementing legislation only within the constitutional  limits of  its authority.  Its authority  is  not permitted to extend beyond  its  jurisdiction to  the  provincial  level.    Therefore, the  federal  government  cannot  implement  international  law at the level of provincial jurisdiction.

29 

Examples  of  important  international  wildlife  and  biodiversity  treaties  that  have  been  ratified  by  Canada  which  eventually  spurred  the  creation  of  federal  legislation  include  the  Migratory  Birds  Protection  Convention,  leading  to  the  Migratory  Birds  Convention Act, 1994 the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species  of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), leading to the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and  Regulation  of  International  and  Interprovincial  Trade  Act  (WAPPRITTA)  and  the  Convention  on Biological  Diversity,  which  led  to  Canada's  Species  at  Risk  Act.   These  are elaborated on below.  Very  few  worldwide  environmental  treaties  pertaining  to  species  protection  had  been established prior to the 1970s.  The Migratory Birds Protection Convention is a rare  case.    It  was  initially  established  in  1916  as  a  treaty  between  the  United  States  and  Canada  (Great  Britain)  on  the  basis  that  international  cooperation  is  required  to  protect  migratory birds, because their habitat spans more than one country.  It was subsequently  negotiated  for  the  entire  continent  of  North  America:    Canada,  the  United  States,  and  Mexico.    The  treaty  was  negotiated  to  prevent  the  extinction  of  migratory  birds  and  to  "establish regulations  for their crossboundary protection" (Greenbaum  and  Wellington,  2010: 9192 Heritage Canada,  n.d.).  The Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 is the  current federal legislation that arose from the international convention.  The Act commits  Canada  to  implement  the  protection  of  North  American  migratory  bird  habitat.    The  federal  government  asserts  its  authority  over  transboundary  species  through  this  Act.  Commercialization by hunting and trafficking of migratory birds is prohibited under the  Act, while the establishment of Migratory Bird Refuges in sensitive areas of importance  is  encouraged,  in  order  to  protect  them  from  the  threat  of  habitat  destruction  and  overhunting (Greenbaum and Wellington, 2010: 9192, 386).  All  migratory  birds  fall  within  federal  jurisdiction  and  their  protection  is  the  responsibility of the federal government.  However, the Act protects only migratory birds  and it does not apply to other species at risk.  For this reason, it does not address holistic  biodiversity protection, nor is it beneficial to the specific protection of species at risk.  Canada ratified the 1973 Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of  Wild Flora and Fauna, commonly known as CITES, and then followed up with passage  of  Canada's  Wild  Animal  and  Plant  Protection  and  Regulation  of  International  and

30 

Interprovincial Trade Act (WAPPRIITA).  One  large drawback to WAPPRIITA is that  it  only enables the protection of species at risk within the context of trade and commerce.  Hence, its protection of biodiversity is extremely limited.  Also, the administration of the  Act  is  shared  among  federal  and  provincial/territorial  agencies,  thus  relying  upon  inter  jurisdictional cooperation (Amos et al., 2001: 139 Greenbaum and Wellington, 2010: 92  93).    This  may  even  complicate  matters  further,  since  it  is  always  more  difficult  to  achieve  a  consensus  when  there  are  matters  of  overlapping  jurisdiction.    Nonetheless,  even  when  the  responsibility  is  distributed  among  different  levels  of  government,  cooperation  is  further  complicated,  paving  the  way  for  "jurisdictional  gridlock",  a  term  that was defined and explained in section 3.1.  This concept will be further elaborated in  section 3.4.  The  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  was  introduced  at  the  United  Nations  Conference  on  Environment  and  Development  of  1992,  also  known  as  the  Rio  Conference,  or  the  Earth  Summit.    The  Convention  required  that  each  nation  establish  measures  for  conserving  biological  diversity,  insofar  as  also  developing  legislation  or  other  regulatory  provisions  for  the  protection  of  threatened  species  and  populations  (Amos  et  al.,  2001:  140).    It  is  also  one  of  only  a  few  international  agreements  on  sustainable development that are legally binding, when transformed into law (Greenbaum  and  Wellington,  2010:  386).    The  CBD  is  particularly  significant  for  incorporating  the  precautionary  principle.    Recall  that  the  conception  behind  the  principle  is  that  action  should  be  taken  to  decrease  or  eliminate  environmental  hazards  even  if  there  is  no  scientific  proof  that  the  suspected  hazard  is  causing  harm.    Within  the  context  of  endangered  species  preservation,  the  burden  of  proof  should  lie  with  those  whose  activities  disrupt  the  environment,  endanger  species,  and  cause  biodiversity  loss,  to  demonstrate that their  actions  will  not result  in  damage  to  species,  ecosystems,  and  the  biosphere.  If this cannot be proven, it is best to err on the side of caution and thus it is  important  to  preserve  as  many  species  as  possible.    The  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity paved the way for the establishment of the Species at Risk Act (SARA).  In turn,  the  precautionary  principle  is  present  as  a  cornerstone  of  the  SARA.   It  is  worth  noting  that the precautionary principle can be found in other Canadian environmental laws, such  as  the  omnibus  Canadian  Environmental  Protection  Act,  1999.    The  principle  has  also

31 

been incorporated into some provincial laws such as the Ontario Endangered Species Act,  2007.  It is readily apparent that international law has quite a bearing on what occurs on  the  national  legal  front.    It  is  especially  evident  that  Canada  has  been  slow  to  enact  legislation  pertaining  to  biodiversity  protection  after  signing  the  CBD.    In  doing  so,  Canada has also demonstrated that it lags behind other nations when attempting to legally  safeguard biodiversity through legislation.  One of the most notorious examples of this is  the United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA), which was passed in 1973 twenty nine  years  before Canada's  long awaited SARA (Illical and Harrison, 2007:  367).  The main  reason  for  the  prolonged  time  span  for  enacting  SARA  is  the  difficulty  in  satisfying  all  stakeholders and ultimately coming to a consensus in a timely manner.  In addition, the  Canadian  government  was  able  to  draw  lessons  from  the  United  States  Act,  which  incorporates "command and control" and "prohibitive policy", while Canada opted for a  persuasive  model.    The  American  experience  also  mobilized  Canadian  business  and  agricultural interests to lobby the Canadian government to avoid the costly US direction  of  conflict  and  litigation.    In  doing  so,  the  lobbyists  hoped  to  avoid  the  burden  of  financial  and  nonfinancial  costs  due  to  excessive  litigation  and  intentional  killing  of  endangered  species  for  fear  of  punishment  in  the  absence  of  protectionist  measures  (Greenbaum and Wellington, 2010: 479481).  The United States Act played an important  role in the debate over the establishment of the Canadian Species at Risk Act.  However, a  thorough and detailed discussion of the US Endangered Species Act is beyond the scope  of this paper.   For further elaboration on the  specifics of the United States Endangered  Species  Act  please  see  Greenbaum  and  Wellington  (2010:  479481)  and  Illical  and  Harrison (2007). 

3.3 Policy Tools and Legal Measures at the Federal Level  3.3.1 Before the Species at Risk Act  Prior  to  the  1990s,  there  was  not  much  recognition  of  the  importance  of  biodiversity  and  protecting  species  at  risk.    Some  federal  legislation  yielding  legal  authority had been previously enacted that covered some aspects of species at risk.  Yet,  no  one  single  statute  had  been  dedicated  to  prioritizing  the  preservation  of  endangered

32 

species.    The  Canada  National  Parks  Act  is  only  restricted  to the  protection  of  species  that have a connection to national parks, which, on the grand scope of the entire nation  means  that  it  is  not  necessarily  protecting  very  many  endangered  species.    The  Act  authorizes penalties for individuals who `hunt, disturb, confine, or possess threatened or  protected species' within the context of Canada's national parks (Amos et al., 2001: 139).  The Fisheries Act and the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 both grant the federal  government  authority  and  jurisdiction  over  the  protection  of  species  at  risk,  but  neither  include  provisions  that  specifically  mention  "species  at  risk",  nor  do  they  mandate  development of strategies to protect them (ibid.).  Also, these Acts only give the federal  government  jurisdiction  over  the  protection  of  aquatic  species  and  migratory  birds  respectively.  Mentioned in section 3.2, WAPPRIITA only authorizes the protection of species at  risk  within  the  context  of  trade  and  commerce,  by  prohibiting  the  international  or  interprovincial  transport  of  endangered  species  (Amos  et  al.,  2001:  139).    The  Canada  Wildlife Act is potentially the most useful of the legislation that predates the Species at  Risk Act, since it gives authority to the federal government to carry out public education  and  research  for  wildlife  conservation,  providing  for  some  means  of  protecting  endangered  flora  and  fauna,  while  generating  public  concern.    Nonetheless,  it  is  not  centrally focused specifically on protecting endangered species (ibid.).  The  importance  of  interjurisdictional  cooperation  to  the  conservation  and  protection of species at risk was recognized in October of 1996, when federal, provincial,  and territorial wildlife ministers came to an agreement in the Wildlife Ministers Council  of  Canada.    Each  jurisdiction  committed  to  pass  legislation  and  programs  to  protect  species at risk and their habitats, endorsing the establishment of the National Accord for  the  Protection  of  Species  at  Risk.    The  accord  delineates  basic  principles  of  species  conservation and a number of commitments to protect species at risk.  The emphasis on  governments to play  a  leadership role  in the conservation of species at risk outlines the  economic  and  noneconomic  importance  of  biodiversity  and  species  at  risk  protection  nationwide.    It  is  specifically  noted  within  the  Accord  that  provincial  cooperation  is  essential to provide effective protection  for species at risk and their  habitats throughout  the nation.  Under the  Accord, the Canadian Endangered Species  Conservation Council

33 

(CESCC)  was  created  in  1998  to  facilitate  cooperation.    The  Council  is  composed  of  federal  ministers  of  Environment,  Fisheries  and  Oceans,  and  Heritage,  as  well  as  the  provincial and territorial ministers who are responsible for wildlife species (Amos et al.,  2001: 141 Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk Backgrounder, n.d.).  The Accord obligates each jurisdiction to pass endangered species legislation and  establish  specific  minimum  requirements  such  as  recovery  plans  and  habitat  protection  (Elgie,  2003:  518).    Yet,  presently,  only  six  provinces  Â­  Nova  Scotia,  New  Brunswick,  Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador Â­ have enacted legislation  that was created specifically for the protection of species at risk.  In September of 1998,  the  ministers reinforced the provisions of the  Accord by emphasizing the  importance of  stewardship  in  protecting  species  at  risk  (Accord  for  the  Protection  of  Species  at  Risk  Backgrounder, n.d.).  Stewardship and voluntary initiatives as policy tools will be further  highlighted in the case studies in chapters 5 and 7.  Prior to the development of a specific piece of endangered  species  legislation  in  Canada,  few  legal  bodies  and  tools  dedicated  to  species  at  risk  protection  were  in  existence.  Those that did exist were also very limited in scope, in terms of their authority  over the protection of species identified as being at risk.  Federal government bodies that  existed,  and  continue  to  exist,  had  no  actual  legal  authority.    Examples  include  the  Committee  on  the  Status  of  Endangered  Wildlife  in  Canada  (COSEWIC),  which  was  established  in  1978.    Composed  of  a  panel  of  scientific  experts  from  provincial,  territorial,  and  federal  wildlife  agencies,  alongside  nongovernmental  organizations,  its  primary function is to issue status reports on species thought to be at risk, and to assign  designations to each species.  COSEWIC  is  specifically  composed  of  members  from  each  provincial  and  territorial  wildlife  agency,  four  federal  agencies  (Canadian  Wildlife  Service,  Parks  Canada,  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada,  and  the  Federal  Biodiversity  Information  Partnership, chaired by the Canadian Museum of Nature), three nongovernment science  members,  and  the  cochairs  of  the  Species  Specialist  and  the  Aboriginal  Traditional  Knowledge  Subcommittees  (Amos  et  al.,  2001:  139).    The  members  of  COSEWIC  provide advice as specialists  in their  field, and  not as representatives of their  individual  agencies,  in  attempts  to  establish  a  platform  for  the  convergence  of  interests  of  various

34 

actors holding stakes in species at risk in Canada (ibid.).  Currently, COSEWIC is made  up  of  31  members.  The  voting  membership  consists  of  members  from  each  of  the  13  provincial  and  territorial  government  wildlife  agencies,  4  federal  agencies  (Canadian  Wildlife  Service,  Parks  Canada  Agency,  Department  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans,  and  the  Federal  Biodiversity  Information  Partnership,  chaired  by  the  Canadian  Museum  of  Nature),  3  nongovernment  science  members,  10  Cochairs  of  the  Species  Specialist  Subcommittees  (SSCs)  and  1  Cochair  from  the  Aboriginal  Traditional  Knowledge  (ATK)  Subcommittee.    Members  have  extensive  experience  with  wildlife  and  biology,  including  Aboriginal  Traditional  Knowledge,  ecology,  genetics,  and  management.  Members  of  COSEWIC  are  university  academics,  independent  experts,  Aboriginal  people, or government, museum or independent biologists who volunteer their time and  efforts (COSEWIC, 2010b).  To  this  day,  COSEWIC  has  no  legal  authority,  as  it  only  yields  the  power  to  designate  or  list  a  species,  but  does  not  actually  have  the  authority  to  protect  a  species  that has been listed (Elgie, 2003: 510).  The committee is, however, a crucial component  of the decision making process which readily intersects with implementation of the policy  goal of protecting species at risk.  The categories applied by COSEWIC are outlined and  defined in Table 3.1.  Table 3.1:  COSEWIC Wildlife Species Definitions and Status Categories  Wildlife  Species:  A  species,  subspecies,  variety,  or  geographically  or  genetically  distinct population of animal, plant or other organism, other than a bacterium or virus,  that  is  wild  by  nature  and  is  either  native  to  Canada  or  has  extended  its  range  into  Canada  without  human  intervention  and  has  been  present  in  Canada  for  at  least  50  years.  Extinct (X): A wildlife species that no longer exists  Extirpated (XT): A wildlife species that no longer exists in the wild in Canada, but  exists elsewhere  Endangered (E): A wildlife species facing imminent extirpation or extinction  Threatened (T): A wildlife species that is likely to become Endangered if nothing is  done to reverse the factors leading to its extirpation or extinction

35 

Special Concern (SC): A wildlife species that may become Threatened or  Endangered because of a combination of biological characteristics and identified  threats  Not at Risk (NAR): A wildlife species that has been evaluated and found to be not at  risk of extinction given the current circumstances  Data Deficient (DD): A category that applies when the available information is  insufficient (a) to resolve a wildlife species' eligibility for assessment or (b) to permit  an assessment of the wildlife species' risk of extinction

In 1988, the Recovery of Nationally Endangered Wildlife (RENEW) was formed.  It  is  made  up  of  representatives  from  federal  and  provincial  wildlife  agencies.    These  include three  federal departments:  Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans  Canada,  and Canadian Heritage.  RENEW was also intended as a means of reporting to the public  on  progress  made  under  the  Accord  for  the  Protection  of  Species  at  Risk.    As  such,  RENEW is under the general direction of the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation  Council (CESCC) (Environment Canada, 2001).  The primary responsibility of RENEW  is to establish recovery teams for species which are listed as endangered or threatened by  COSEWIC.  These tend to be vertebrate species.  It is notable to mention that RENEW  has  not established  many recovery plans over the duration of  its existence.  It had only  had 21 plans approved by 2003, in 15 years of existence.  Also, these recovery plans do  not  have  legal  force  (Elgie,  2009:  510).    In  addition,  RENEW  is  heavily  reliant  upon  volunteer effort and is often riddled with inadequate funding (Scudder, 1999: 963).  Academics,  scholars,  and  scientists,  many  of  which  are  members  of  COSEWIC  and RENEW, understand most causes of species declines in Canada.  These individuals  directly  affect  Canada's  species  at  risk  by  informing  policy  makers  and  they  are  indirectly  responsible  for  maintaining  Canada's  biodiversity.  They  take  it  upon  themselves to scientifically inform political decisionmakers (Amos et al., 2001: 149).

Scientists play a very crucial role in biodiversity protection.  Bocking (2004: 16  19) maintains that science must accomplish two functions if it is to play an effective role  in the resolution of environmental problems  such as species  at risk conservation.   First,  the  available  scientific  information  must  be  relevant  and  credible,  as  per  the  scientific  method.  Second, it must be readily available so that all stakeholders have liberal access  to the information they need in order to present and support their views.  The  different  interests  of  each  stakeholder  group  has  an  impact  on  whether  a  consensus,  or  "minimum  willing  coalition"  can  be  reached  to  successfully  satisfy  each  stakeholder  interest  and  maintain  a  delicate  balance  while  guaranteeing  adequate  protection for Canadian species at risk (Amos et al., 2001: 139).  Once a decision is made

37 

on the formulation of specific policies, there are numerous policy tools that are available  for  the  implementation  of  policy.    With  regards  to  species  at  risk  policy,  enabling  legislation and regulations are the primary instruments.  Soon  after  the  passage  of  the  National  Accord  for  the  Protection  of  Species  at  Risk, and after many years of stakeholder consultation, Bill C65 was introduced.  It was  intended to become the Canada Endangered Species Protection Act (Amos et al., 2001:  141).    The  bill  was,  however,  frowned  upon  by  "virtually  every  stakeholder  group  Â­  industry,  landowners,  environmentalists,  First  Nations,  and  provincial  governments"  (Amos et al., 2001: 144).  Most opposition also arose because of controversies within the  United States regarding the US Endangered Species Act of 1973.  Stakeholders did  not  want  those  same  controversies  echoed  within  Canadian  borders.    Bill  C65  pitted  economic  interests  against  environmentalists.    Business,  agricultural  lobbyists,  and  landowners  did  not  want  a  regulatory  "commandandcontrol"  approach  to  species  protection which places a financial burden on the private sector, similar to the approach  in  the  US,  and  they  emphasized  the  need  for  publicly  funded  voluntary  stewardship  instead.  Environmentalists stressed the need to preserve the critical habitat of endangered  species,  as  the  bill  was  only  proposing  "a  ban  on  destruction  of  a  species'  `residence',  defined  by  the  bill  as  its  nest or den, [which] would do  little to address  loss of  habitat,  which is viewed by the scientific community as the primary threat to biodiversity" (Illical  and Harrison, 2007: 377).  They claimed that bill C65 was not sufficient because it did  not  include  mandatory  habitat  protection  for  species  at  risk.    At  the  same  time,  the  provinces  feared  that  their  provincial  authority  over  Crown  lands  for  resource  and  economic  exploitation  would  be  compromised  by  overarching  federal  government  jurisdiction,  creating  jurisdictional  gridlock  (Illical  and  Harrison,  2007:  377).    The  provinces claimed that the bill allowed the federal government to overstep jurisdictional  boundaries  and  allowed  it  too  much  intervention.    First  Nations  also  questioned  the  authority of the federal government to pursue its proposals (Amos et al., 2001: 140, 144).  Among all this controversy, Bill C65 was left to die on the order paper with the calling  of an election in June of 1997 (ibid.).

The importance of scientific criteria for the selection and listing of species at risk  was  deemed  to  be  essential.    This  ultimately  would  make  scientific  and  not  political  criteria for designation of utmost significance.  The ideal would be to allow COSEWIC to  legally  list  species  at  risk  under  the  endangered  species  legislation  (Amos  et  al.,  2001:  139).    It  was  hoped  that  sound  scientific  information  could  also  be  the  basis  of  "nondiscretionary critical  habitat protection, recovery plans, and prohibitions on takings  of listed species" (Illical and Harrison, 2007: 378).  Prior to the  introduction of the  Species at Risk Act, there were  insufficient  legal  tools  dedicated  to  specifically  target  the  problem  of  species  at  risk.  There  are  serious  questions as to whether the Species at Risk Act has adequately  filled the void.  The Act  will now be described and its shortcomings will be highlighted. 

3.3.2 The Federal Species at Risk Act (SARA)  Designated laws are the main legal tools that all jurisdictions in Canada rely upon  for  the  protection  of  species  and  habitat.    The  centerpiece  of  policy  tools  for  the  preservation  of  species  at  risk  in  all  of  Canada  is  the  federal  Species  at  Risk  Act.    As  enacted legislation, it is the primary instrument that has been set in place by the federal  government.  A summary of SARA is provided in table 3.4. 

Table 3.4:  A summary of the Species at Risk Act (Bill C5) Â·  The  purposes  of  this  enactment  are  to  prevent  Canadian  indigenous  species,  subspecies  and  distinct  populations  of  wildlife  from  becoming  extirpated  or  extinct,  to  provide  for  the  recovery  of  endangered  or  threatened  species,  to  encourage  the  management  of  other  species  to  prevent  them  from  becoming  at  risk. Â·  This  enactment  establishes  the  Committee  on the  Status of  Endangered  Wildlife  in  Canada  (COSEWIC)  as  an  independent  body  of  experts  responsible  for  assessing and identifying species at risk. Â·  It provides that COSEWIC's assessments are to be reported to the Minister of the  Environment and to the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation Council and  it authorizes the Governor in Council to establish by regulation the official list of  species at risk based on that process.

39 

Â·  It  creates  prohibitions  to  protect  listed  threatened  and  endangered  species  and  their critical habitat. Â·  It recognizes  that  compensation  may  be  needed  to  ensure  fairness  following  the  imposition of the critical habitat prohibitions. Â·  It  creates  a  public  registry  to  assist  in  making  documents  under  the  Act  more  accessible to the public. Â·  It  is  consistent  with  Aboriginal  and  treaty  rights  and  respects  the  authority  of  other federal ministers and provincial governments.

Within  the  SARA,  a  variety  of  policy  instruments  are  advocated,  including  recovery  strategies,  action  plans,  and  management  plans.  Recovery  strategies  are  mandatory  for  all  listed  species.    They  are  "detailed  plans  that  outline  shortterm  objectives  and  longterm  goals  for  protecting  and  recovering  species  at  risk"  (SARA,  Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2009).  Action plans are used to provide a  summary of "the projects and activities required to meet recovery strategy objectives and  goals"  (ibid.).    The  plans  are  used  to  implement  projects  and  activities  in  order  to  improve the status of a species (ibid.).  Management plans  "set goals and objectives  for  maintaining  sustainable  population  levels  of  one  or  more  species  that  are  particularly  sensitive  to  environmental  factors,  but  which  are  not  yet  considered  in  danger  of  becoming extinct" (ibid.).  Offences  and  punishments  are  laid  out  in  Section  97  of  the  Species  at  Risk  Act.  They  are  applied  in  the  event  of  an  infringement  of  the  provisions  of  the  Act  or  an  emergency order.  Despite the existence of these punishments, an emphasis is placed on  voluntary  measures  and  subsidized  stewardship,  as  outlined  in  Section  10  of  the  Act  (Illical and Harrison, 2007: 367).  Monetary  compensation  is  also  a  facet  of  Canada's  endangered  species  policy,  whereby  funding  is  granted  to  private  interests  that  may  be  affected  by  subsequent  regulation.  The advocacy of such permissive policy tools is a stark contrast to the more  adversarial, regulatory, command and control approach of the United States Endangered  Species  Act  (Illical  and  Harrison,  2007:  367).    In  essence,  the  Canadian  approach  to

40

endangered species policy allows species at risk to persist based on the availability and  the allocation of state funds.  With  regards  to  policy  formulation,  decision  making,  and  implementation,  administrators  acting  under  statutory  authority  make  most  environmental  regulatory  decisions.    They  have  a  responsibility  to  design  regulations  and  guidelines,  interpret  statutory  terms,  apply  the  interpretations  to  facts,  and  use  discretion  when  making  decisions  on  individual  cases,  often  while  attempting  to  balance  competing  interests  (Valiante, 2009: 34).  Under  some statutes,  including the  Species at Risk Act, decisions  made  by  administrators  can  be  appealed  to  specialized  tribunals.    The  court's  involvement  is  usually  limited  to  appeals  on  a  `question  of  law'  or  through  judicial  review.  Judicial review is "a mechanism for ensuring the accountability of administrative  decisionmakers  through  the  courts,  but  on  limited  grounds"  (ibid.).    Some  prominent  cases  have  been  appealed  under  SARA.    These  cases  highlight  the  inadequacies  of  the  Act, as outlined in section 3.3.4.  The Species at Risk Act outlines specific mandatory criteria that allows for a more  delineated  discretion  and  greater  opportunities  for  courts  to  provide  supervision.    For  instance,  the  SARA  includes  a  requirement  for  the  development  of  recovery  strategies  addressing particular criteria within a specified deadline for all listed endangered species  (Valiante, 2009: 35).  Environmental groups have brought judicial review applications for  numerous instances of failure to identify critical habitat in recovery strategies (Valiante,  2009: 44, note 37).  "Critical habitat" is all habitat that is necessary and essential for the  survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species (SARA, 2002).  Two judicial review cases  under SARA are described in section 3.3.4.  The  Species  at  Risk  Act  is  centred  on  habitatbased  species  protection  and  voluntary stewardship with an incorporation of compensation if there would be a need to  take over lands as outlined in Sections 10 and 11 of the Act.  The SARA was able to quell  the  concerns  of  the  major  stakeholders:    environmentalists  and  scientists,  and  business  and  agricultural  parties.    The  Act  that  came  to  fruition  was  essentially  a  compromise  between  the  environmental  and  business  communities,  one  that  has  been  called  a  "minimum  willing  coalition"  by  Amos  et  al.  (2001:  139)  (Illical  and  Harrison,  2007:  381).

41 

The goals of the Species at Risk Act incorporate the prevention of the extirpation  or  extinction  of  species.    The  Act  also  stresses  the  importance  of  providing  for  the  recovery  of  endangered  or  threatened  species  via  recovery  plans,  as  well  as  the  encouragement  of  the  management  of  other  species  in  order  to  prevent  them  from  becoming at risk, as outlined in Sections 37 to 55 of the Act.  Sections 14 to 31 of the Act  delineate  that  COSEWIC's  species  designations  are  still  to  be  taken  into  consideration.  However, they are to be reported to the Minister of the Environment and to the Canadian  Endangered Species Conservation Council.  The council then authorizes the Governor in  Council  to  establish  an  official  list  of  species  at  risk  (Illical  and  Harrison,  2007:  381).  Ultimately, the final decision rests in the hands of the politicians.  Critical  habitat  of  listed  threatened  and  endangered  species  is  protected  under  prohibitions  in  the  Act.    Compensation  is  granted  to  parties  that  are  economically  impacted  by  critical  habitat  prohibitions.    The  Act  encourages  public  education  via  the 
12  creation  of  a  public  registry  ,  making  documents  under  the  Act  more  accessible  to the 

average citizen.  In addition, aboriginal and treaty rights are also respected under the Act,  as well as the authority of other federal ministers and provincial governments, so as not to  overstep  federal  jurisdictional  boundaries,  respecting  the  constitutional  division  of  powers.  With respect to jurisdiction, only  "federal species" are afforded protection under  SARA.    "Federal  species"  are  aquatic  species,  migratory  birds,  and  species  found  on  federal  Crown  lands.    The  patchwork  of  authorities  as  outlined  by  the  constitutional  division of powers affords different species varying levels of protection.  Migratory birds are treated differently from other "federal" species with respect to  habitat protection, in line with Article II of the Migratory Birds Convention.  Migratory  bird  species  benefit  from  an  additional  layer  of  protection  under  the  Migratory  Birds  Convention  Act,  1994  (Elgie,  2003:  511).    "Nonfederal  species",  or  species  that  fall  within provincial jurisdiction, are not directly protected by the SARA.  Accentuating the complexities of varying levels of protection afforded to species  at  risk  under  the  Act,  provisions  to  protect  the  critical  habitat  of  species  on  provincial  land  exist  under  Section  61  (3).    Under  the  federal  `safety  net'  clause,  the  federal

environment  minister  is  given  the  authority  to  invoke  these  provisions  and  make  a  recommendation to protect the critical habitat of a "nonfederal species" that is listed as  endangered  or  threatened,  provided  it  is  not  adequately  protected  under  provincial  or  territorial  laws.    This  occurs  if  the  Minister  is  requested  to  do  so  by  a  provincial  or  territorial  minister, or by the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation Council.  If a  SARA listed species is deemed to not be effectively protected under existing provincial or  territorial laws, the Minister must recommend that Cabinet order protections under SARA  to  apply  on  private,  provincial,  or  territorial  lands  (Elgie,  2003:  517  Elgie,  2009).  Emergency protection  for a listed species  is also made possible under Section 80 of the  Act, allowing the Governor in Council to make an emergency order to protect the listed  species upon recommendation by the Minister (ibid.). 

3.3.3 Inadequacies of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)  Some  loopholes  and  inadequacies  of  the  Species  at  Risk  Act  have  already  been  alluded  to  above.    They  will  be  reiterated  and  discussed  further  below.    Non  governmental  organizations  have  provided  extensive  documentation  and  analysis  to 
13  demonstrate that SARA has not lived up to its promise. 

The  challenges  of  SARA  seem  most  prominent  when  it  is  contrasted  with  the  United  States  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973.  The  approach  of  the  US  endangered  species law relies primarily upon what is termed as `command and control' regulation.  It  has generated considerable controversy due to the costs of protection borne by the private  sector.  SARA on  the  other  hand,  emphasizes  publicly  supported,  voluntary  stewardship.  Yet,  many  environmentalists  insist  that  SARA  is  too  cautious,  and  simply  does  not  do  enough to protect Canada's endangered species (Suzuki, 2001).  The  statute  was  created  based  on  a  decentralized  approach  as  a  result  of  the  constitutional  division  of  powers.    Mary  Illical  and  Kathryn  Harrison  (2007:  370)  eloquently explain the importance of the division of powers with respect to protection of  endangered species:

(...)  the  constitution  grants  provincial  governments  ownership  of  very  extensive  Crown  resources,  with  which  comes  authority  to  manage  species  resident  on  those  Crown  lands  (...)  While  the  provinces  have  uncontested  authority  to  conserve  their  own  resources  as  they  see  fit,  provincial  governments'  defensiveness  concerning their natural resource jurisdiction arguably owes more to  their  desire  to  exploit  those  resources  as  a  source  of  economic  development.  The jurisdictional gridlock created by the constitutional division of powers is essentially  the  root  cause  of  disagreement  and  litigation.    An  example  of  this  is  illustrated  in  the  lawsuit  involving  Western  Canada  Wilderness  Committee  v.  British  Columbia.    The  outcome of the  litigation will  be discussed  further  in  section 7.1.  Two other cases that  have been brought to court for judicial review will be discussed in section 3.3.4.  The ultimate decision to list species lies within Cabinet, and not COSEWIC, and  members  of  the  environmental  community  are  still  very  critical  of  this  (Illical  and  Harrison,  2007:  379).    As  well,  many  environmental  advocates  maintain  that  the  mechanism  for  listing  species  should  be  based  on  scientific  criteria,  not  political  ones  (Illical  and  Harrison,  2007:  378).    Also,  protection  of  critical  habitat  is  left  to  the  discretion of Cabinet, which may choose not to actually enforce action.  This all depends  on the involvement of the provincial government in the protection of the critical habitat.  The  cooperation  between  the  two  levels  of  government  creates  yet  another  situation  of  jurisdictional gridlock (Illical and Harrison, 2007:  379).  The  Act  essentially  allows  for  some  legitimate  measures  and  options  for  preserving endangered species.  All of them require an adequate amount of resources, be  they  financial  or  otherwise.    Some  options  include  the  purchase  of  private  land  for  conversion into federal parkland, and providing compensation to private landowners and  industry for any economic losses they may incur as a result of voluntarily refraining from  critical  habitat  destruction.    Also,  the  government  has  a  responsibility  to  recompense  industry  for economic  losses and  for  licenses that  may  have  been previously  granted to  extract resources, such as logging and mining, from Crown lands, which are now deemed  to be critical habitat.  These measures can be very costly and are extremely limited, since

44 

there are limits to the amount of funds that taxpayers are willing to allocate to endangered  species  preservation.    The  same  dilemma  arises  when  ordering  directives  for  resource  extraction and development, as well as parks and land use planning, once the previously  mentioned actions have been taken.  These procedures require a great deal of monitoring  and enforcement, and hence necessitate adequate funding and personnel training.  It is for  this reason that voluntary measures and stewardship programs are favoured over all other  options,  within  the  realm  of  the  SARA.    Through  the  encouragement  of  private  landowners and  industry,  as  well as the opportunity  for  financial  incentives  such  as tax  exemptions,  voluntary  measures  are  hailed  as  the  most  cost  effective  of  all  available  measures of endangered species protection.  It remains to be seen if they are truly the best  means of species at risk preservation.  An  overview  of  existing  legal  measures  at  the  provincial  level  in  Ontario  and  British  Columbia  and  their  effect  on  case  study  species  in  conjunction  with  the  federal  Species at Risk Act is discussed in the following chapters. 

3.3.4 Litigation for Judicial Review  Litigation is a policy tool that is available to stakeholders, usually public interest  groups, to appeal to the courts to ensure that the provisions of a statute are being properly  upheld.  With regard to the Species at Risk Act, there have been several important cases  brought  to  Federal  Court.    Two  cases  in  particular  resulted  in  the  setting  of  important  precedents  for  endangered  species  with  regard  to  SARA.    One  concerned  the  Greater  SageGrouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) while the other concerned the Nooksack Dace 
14  (Rhinichthys cataractae). 

3.3.4.1  The  Greater  SageGrouse:    Alberta  Wilderness  Association  v.  Canada  (Environment)  In July 2009, a precedent was set for the use of the Species at Risk Act to compel  judicial  review  of  environmental  policy  (Association  of  Corporate  Counsel,  2009).  Working  in  cooperation,  in  February  2008,  a  coalition  of  ENGOs  submitted  an  application  for  judicial review of the  "Recovery  Strategy  for the Greater SageGrouse".

The endangered species was once widespread across the prairies.  It is now only found in  remote areas in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan.  The habitat of the  bird has been fragmented due to oil and gas development (Ecojustice, 2009).  Concerning the case of Alberta Wilderness Association v. Canada (Environment),  the ENGOs pointed out that the "Recovery Strategy issued by the [Environment] Minister  [Jim Prentice] did not identify any critical habitat" (Federal Court Decision, July 2009).  Siding with the ENGOs, Federal Court justice Russell Zinn ruled that the Minister of the  Environment broke the law because sufficient knowledge exists to identify critical habitat  of  the  species,  particularly  their  breeding  grounds  (Ecojustice,  2009).    The  judge  maintained that there is no provision of discretion in this matter, and that the requirement  to  list  all  critical  habitat  reflects  an  application  of  the  precautionary  principle.    He  also  held that as long as some critical habitat is identifiable, it must be listed in the Recovery  Strategy.  This case is of utmost significance for endangered species policy, as the ruling  provides a guide on how the Minister  must consider critical  habitat protection, and thus  consider current scientific fact to inform policy.  Scientific knowledge that allows for the identification of the causation of species  declines  is  incorporated into recovery strategies  and  management plans.   As outlined  in  Section 41(1) of the Species at Risk Act, it is required that critical habitat be identified to  the  most  complete  extent  possible  and  that  it  be  based  on  the  best  available  scientific  information.  If available knowledge is not taken into consideration, then implementation  gaps will occur and critical habitat will not be adequately protected.  As a result, a species  could  continue  to  suffer  declines.    Gaps  in  implementation  could  lead  to  serious  infringements of policy objectives.  Such gaps may result in defeating the purpose of the  policy that was initially created to resolve the defined problem. 

3.3.4.2 The Nooksack Dace:  Environmental Defence Canada v. Canada  Litigation  also  took  place  over  the  endangered  Nooksack  Dace,  a  small,  freshwater minnow found in four rivers in the Fraser Valley area of British Columbia.  A  coalition of ENGOs launched an application for judicial review in Federal Court in 2007,  claiming  that  the  recovery  strategy  for  the  Nooksack  Dace  did  not  conform  to  the

46 

requirements  of  the  Act  because  it  did  not  identify  critical  habitat  to  the  best  extent  possible.  Adequate  scientific  information  was  available  that  explained  the  decline  of  the  species,  as  well  as  the  requirement  of  the  species  to  sustain  a  stable  population,  and  to  ensure  its  survival  and  recovery.    The  Recovery  Team  recommended  that  all  suitable  habitats be designated as critical.  Even though critical habitat had been mapped out and  defined,  it  was  not  included  in  the  final  version  of  the  "Recovery  Strategy  for  the  Nooksack Dace".  Critical habitat definitions were being left out of recovery strategies in  accordance with a "new" SARA policy directive that ensured that "critical habitat should  be removed  from all  RS [Recovery Strategies  in  the Pacific Region]  in  process and  for  the  foreseeable  future  until  a  clear  policy  direction  has  been  provided"  (Environmental  Defence Canada v. Canada, para. 16).  The government stated that this policy directive  was  introduced  because  critical  habitat  information  in  some  recovery  strategies  had  not  yet  been  submitted  for  peer  review.    It  stated  that  it  wished  to  conduct  scientific  peer  review  in  order  to  ensure  that  critical  habitat  identification  would  be  "scientifically  defensible" (Environmental Defence v. Canada, para. 18).  Other reasons  for not listing  critical  habitat  in  recovery  strategies  included  the  need  to  consult  with  all  potentially  affected parties prior to including the  information.  In addition, another reason was that  the definition of critical habitat in the Fisheries Act and Oceans Act were not consistent  with  that  found  in  the  Species  at  Risk  Act  (Environmental  Defence  Canada  v.  Canada,  para. 16).  However,  Federal  Court  Justice  Campbell  maintained  that  neither  reason  could  justify  the  excising  of  information  that  was  known  about the  critical  habitat  of  a  listed  species, because, as per s. 41 of SARA, the critical habitat information did not need to be  subject  to  peer  review,  nor  did  it  require  consultation  with  stakeholders  who  would  be  affected  by  the  identification  of  critical  habitat.   Consultation  could  wait  until  the  final  stages  of  the  process,  such  as  inclusion  within  the  action  plan.    There  was  no  adequate  justification  for  the  exclusion  of  critical  habitat  information  from  recovery  strategies.  The focus of the judge's decision was based mainly on the statutory interpretation  of SARA.    Justice  Campbell  sided  with  the  ENGOs,  insisting  that  a  broad  approach  to  interpretation be applied to fulfill Canada's commitment to applying the principles of the

47 

Convention  on  Biological  Diversity,  and  the  application  of  the  precautionary  principle.  The  precautionary  principle  should  apply  in  the  preparation  of  recovery  strategies  in  accordance  with  s.  38  of  SARA.    The  judge  also  sided  with  the  ENGOs  where  he  maintained  that  an  expansive  definition  of  "habitat"  that  includes  both  location  and  attributes  complies  with  the  values  and  principles  of  the  CBD,  as  they  comprise  what  would be necessary to ensure the protection of a species.  In addition, the identification of  as  much critical  habitat as possible  based on the  best available  scientific  information  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  s.  41  of SARA  are  now  mandatory,  as  this  precedent  was set by Justice Zinn in the case concerning the Greater SageGrouse.  Justice  Campbell  concluded  by  stating  that  the  case  concerning  the  Nooksack  Dace  was  "absolutely  necessary"  because  the  omission  of  mapping  or  designation  of  critical  habitat  were  found  to  represent  `errors  in  law'.    By  approving  such  a  recovery  strategy,  the  Minister  failed  to  "follow  the  law".    The  ENGOs  were  successful  in  their  application for judicial review concerning the Nooksack Dace.  In addition, the case set a  precedent.    Justic  Campbell's  decision  has  significant  implications  for  the  recovery  strategies  of  all  the  other  listed  Pacific  Region  species.    The  implementation  of  the  federal policy directive denying identification of critical habitat in recovery strategies for  species at risk has also been halted as a result of this case.  Hence, via the possibility for judicial review, ENGOs are making use of the court  system  in  order to  establish  proper  protection  for  species  at  risk  under  the  Act  because  existing instruments are not functioning properly, as acknowledged in the aforementioned  case.    Both  cases  also  highlight the  importance  placed  upon  applying  the  precautionary  principle and updated scientific knowledge to the implementation of laws.  3.4 Jurisdictional Challenges and Proposals for Reform  The concept of jurisdictional gridlock was introduced in section 3.1. It is a much  lamented  fact  in  Canadian  policy  circles  that  the  Canadian  constitution  makes  environmental  protection  especially  difficult,  due  to  what  has  been  characterized  as  jurisdictional gridlock.  Welldelineated jurisdictions are often easy to follow in all other  ambits of Canadian law and policy.  However, the environment, which was never given a  clear and apparent place within the Canadian constitution, can be found no place at all, or

48 

it  may  arise  in  every  jurisdiction.    This  is  what  makes  environmental  matters  so  extremely  complicated  in  Canada.    Protection  of  species  at  risk  and  biodiversity  in  Canada is not immune to these issues.  These very obstacles are also apparent in the case  studies that will be examined further in Chapters 5 and 7.  The Species at Risk Act defers much care and protection of species at risk to the  provinces  in  accordance  with  the  constitutional  division  of  powers.    According  to  The  Constitution Act, 1867, all Canadian provinces and territories are granted authority over  natural resources and conservation as outlined in Section 92a.  The constitutional power  that  provides  the  provincial  governments  with  the  authority  to  protect  the  environment  also  grants  direct  authority  to  exploit  natural  resources  for  economic  potential,  and  in  order  to  provide  an  important  source  of  provincial  revenue.    Thus,  provincial  governments  are  very  likely  to  remain  assertive  over  their  constitutional  authority.  Federal  jurisdiction  over  the  environment,  on  the  other  hand,  is  indirect,  and  it  only  applies  to  federal  lands  (only  4  percent  of  Canada's  land  base)  (Harrison,  1996:  19).  Hence,  environmental  policy  tends  to  be  fragmented  among  various  jurisdictions  in  Canada.  The protection of species at risk does not fall solely in the hands of the federal  jurisdiction.  By virtue of the constitutional division of powers, most of the responsibility  lies at the provincial level of government.  As  a  consequence  of  the  federal  system  of  government,  federal  and  provincial  governments  shape  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  public  policy,  either  by  fighting  to  maintain  authority  over  certain  issues,  or  by  deferring  the  responsibility  to  another  level  of  government.    In  the  context  of  environmental  protection,  Kathryn  Harrison (1996: 20) maintains that "constitutional ambiguity and overlapping jurisdiction  provide  an  opportunity  for  either  level  of  government  to  avoid  responsibility  for  environmental protection by pleading inadequate authority and `passing the buck' to the  other level".  In environmental matters, the federal government is most likely to surrender  its  authorities  to the  provinces  in  order to  avoid  `electoral  blame'.    The  `passing  of  the  buck'  is  also  known  as  `blame  avoidance'.    As  is  evident  in  the  case  studies  analyzed  further in Chapters 5 and 7, the same is true within the realm of species at risk protection.  In  the  case  of  the  critically  endangered  Spotted  Owl  in  British  Columbia,  environmentalists  argue  that  the  federal  government  is  not  taking  advantage  of

49 

emergency  provisions  that  are  possible  under  the  Species  at  Risk  Act  to  force  the  protection of the species' critical habitat.  The species is not present on federal lands, nor  does  it  fall  specifically  within  federal  jurisdiction.    By  not  allowing  the  emergency  provision, the federal government is `passing the buck' to the provincial level.  Thus, the issue of blame avoidance highlights the importance of analyzing policy  solutions  between  and  among  levels  of  government.   In  the  case  of  endangered  species  protection, since most of the burden for their management and protection rests upon the  provinces,  it  is  appropriate  for  the  provinces  to  examine  solutions  that  are  currently  functioning in other provinces, and pinpointing which solutions might work well in their  jurisdiction.    The  rationale  for  legal  lesson  drawing  in  this  paper  exists  under  the  same  premise.    The  province  of  British  Columbia,  which  lacks  dedicated  legislation  for  the  protection  of  species  at risk,  is  compared  to  Ontario,  which  has  recently  enacted  a  new  and  revised  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007.    The  province  of  British  Columbia  may  benefit  from  gathering  ideas  and  drawing  lessons  from  the  Ontario  endangered  species  policy experience, considering that Ontario has had endangered species legislation since  1973.    Other  examples  in  the  legal  literature  include  the  work  by  Mary  Illical  and  Kathryn Harrison (2007), who incorporate lesson drawing into their analysis of Canada's  Species at Risk Act and compare  it to the United States Endangered Species Act.  Elgie  (2009) also discusses the  influence of crossjurisdictional  learning  in the creation of the  Species at Risk Act.  A similar method can be used to compare endangered species policy  approaches  among  the  two  different  provincial  jurisdictions  of  British  Columbia  and  Ontario.

50 

CHAPTER  4.0  PROVINCAL  LEGAL  MEASURES  FOR  SPECIES  AT  RISK  IN  ONTARIO  Since  most  species  at  risk  reside  on  nonfederal  lands,  the  provinces  hold  the  greatest  responsibility  for  the  protection  of  species  at  risk  as  outlined  by  the  Canadian  Constitution.  For this reason, prominent current legal measures at the provincial level in  Ontario  and  British  Columbia  are  evaluated  and  later  compared  in  Chapter  8.    Eighty  percent  of  the  province  of  Ontario  is  allocated  as  provincial  land  (Greenbaum  and  Wellington, 2010: 480).  The province of Ontario has a greater array of  legal tools that  are  dedicated  to  species  at  risk  protection.    Thus,  Ontario  legal  tools  are  first  outlined  here, setting the stage as comparator to British Columbia.  The legal measures that exist  in British Columbia will be discussed in Chapter 6.  This chapter encompasses an overview of all provincial legal measures for species  at  risk  in  Ontario.    In  order  to  understand  the  current  legal  situation  in  Ontario  with  regard to species at risk, the chapter begins with a description of legal tools that were in  existence  prior  to  the  central  piece  of  provincial  legislation  dedicated  to  species  at  risk  protection  in  the  province,  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007.    The  Act  and  its  key  components  are  also  outlined,  while  the  chapter  concludes  with  a  description  of  exemptions and flexibility tools that are intrinsic to the ESA, 2007.  The  legal  situation  that  existed  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  recent  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007  indicated  that  changes  were  long  overdue.    The  original  endangered  species  legislation  that  was  enacted  in  1971  was  outdated.    Evaluation  and  assessment  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  1971  and  all  policy  tools  pointed  to  grave  inadequacies.    The  Act  was  deemed  ineffective  because  sciencebased  designation  of  species  at  risk  was  not  mandatory,  nor  was  protection  of  critical  habitat  for  listed  endangered  species.  Scientists  and  ENGOs  maintained  that  changes  to  species  at  risk  policy in Ontario were urgently required.  Their push eventually led to legal reform:  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007.    The  factors  that  set  the  stage  for  legal  reform  and  the  enactment of the recent Act are discussed below.

51 

4.1 Before the Ontario Endangered Species Act, 2007  In  Canada,  Ontario  set  the  stage  for  the  establishment  of  legislation  designated  specifically  for  the  protection  of  species  at  risk  of  extinction.    It  is  significant  that  in  1971,  it  was  the  first  province  to  ever  enact  endangered  species  legislation.    The  Act  coincided with the environmental movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s that placed  considerable  political  pressure  on  the  government  to  put  environmental  issues  on  the  agenda.  The  movement gave way to federal  statutes such as the Canada Shipping Act,  1970,  which  prohibits  the  discharge  or  dumping  of  oil  or  oily  waste  from  ships  the  Fisheries Act, 1970, which prohibits the harming of fish habitat and fishing grounds the  Environmental  Contaminants  Act,  1974,  which  prohibits  the  release  of  toxic  substances  in excess of predetermined limits and the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1970, which  makes it illegal to harm migratory bird habitat and migratory species.  Other significant  Acts  that  were  concerned  with  the  environment  emerged  at  the  provincial  level  during  this  period,  such  as  the  Ontario  Environmental  Protection  Act,  1971,  which  is  the  principal statute in the province that is concerned with enforcing pollution regulation.  It  is  therefore  apparent  that  the  environmental  movement  had  a  tremendous  influence  on  legal reform during this period.  The  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  1971  predated  the  United  States  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973.  The  Act  protected the  species  listed  in  regulation  as  well as their habitats.  The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources was responsible for the  Act's  enforcement.    The  protection  provided  under  the  Act  was  discretionary,  and  the  approach to listing species was not sciencebased.  The Act did at least protect 42 species  and their habitats.  Without the requirement for sciencebased listing, and covering such a  small portion of the species needing protection, it was clear that the Act was in dire need  of  revision.    Reform  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  1971  which  eventually  led  to  the  creation of the Endangered Species Act, 2007 is discussed in Section 6.2.  Aside from a designated statute specifically dedicated to enforcing species at risk  protection, other policy and legal tools have been established in the province of Ontario  for the purposes of protecting species at risk of extinction.  These  are discussed  below.  The  province  has  a  body  with  no  individual  legal  authority,  similar  to  COSEWIC.  Known as the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), it is

52 

responsible  for  reviewing  documentation  on  species  that  may  possibly  be  at  risk.    The  committee is comprised of 11 members.  They are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor  in Council (i.e., Cabinet), who designates one of the members as chair.  Members serve  up to a maximum of three years, and are eligible for reappointment.  COSSARO is made  up  of  experts  originating  from  various  disciplines  and  backgrounds,  such  as  scientific  disciplines  or  Aboriginal  Traditional  Knowledge.    Presently,  the  committee  consists 
15  mainly of scientists with backgrounds in biology, ecology, and zoology. 

COSSARO  was  created  by  the  Ontario  Ministry  of  the  Environment  in  1995.  However,  it  did  not  have  any  legal  clout  prior  to  the  enactment  of  the  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007.    The  committee  evaluates  the  conservation  status  of  species occurring in Ontario and makes recommendations on the status of species at risk.  Based  on  their  expertise,  COSSARO  will  determine  when  species  are  at  risk.    When  determined to be so, these species are listed on the Ministry of Natural Resources Species  at  Risk  in  Ontario  (SARO)  list.    When  a  species  is  classified  as  being  endangered  or  threatened, it will receive protection under the ESA, 2007 (MNR, 2009). 

Table 4.1:  COSSARO Wildlife Species Definitions and Status Categories  The categorization of species at risk under COSSARO is as follows:  Extinct:  A species that no longer lives anywhere in the world.  Extirpated:  A species that lives somewhere in the world, and at one time lived in the  wild in Ontario, but no longer lives in the wild in Ontario.  Endangered:  A species that lives in the wild in Ontario but is facing imminent  extinction or extirpation.  Threatened:  A species that lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered, but is likely  to become endangered if steps are not taken to address factors threatening it.  Special concern:  A species that lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered or  threatened, but may become threatened or endangered due to a combination of biological  characteristics and identified threats.

COSSARO designations are similar to COSEWIC designations, which were discussed in  Chapter 4.  However, there are fewer categories available under COSSARO with respect  to COSEWIC.  COSSARO lacks the Not at Risk and Data Deficient categories that are  available under COSEWIC.  Table 4.2:  Elements of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario  (COSSARO) 
Purpose/Function  Issue sciencebased status reports on species thought to be at risk and to  assign  designations  to  each  species.    Reports  classifications  to  the  Minister  of  Natural  Resources.    Has  only  become  a  legally  recognized  committee after the enactment of the Endangered Species Act, 2007.  A  panel  of  11  members  appointed  by  the  Lieutenant  Governor  in  Council,  who  designates  one  of  the  members  as  chair.    Members  are  experts  in  the  following  areas:    conservation  biology,  population  dynamics, taxonomy, systematics  or genetics  or Aboriginal Traditional  Knowledge (ATK). Expert knowledge of species in a particular region of  Ontario or in a specific taxonomic group, as well as a reasonably broad  knowledge of Ontario's flora and fauna is also required.

The Endangered Species Act, 1971 was very outdated.  Over the years, changes in  land  and  resource  use,  planning  processes,  and  increasing  threats  to  native  species  had  taken place.  The species listing approach was a major element of weakness that required  great  revision.    The  full  spectrum  of  categories  of  species  at  risk  was  not  adequately  protected.    The  1971  Act  left  much  room  for  interpretation  and  limited  protection  to  species  listed  in  the  "endangered"  category.    Hence,  species  that  fall  within  any  other  categories, such as the "threatened" and "special concern" categories, would not have had  the benefit of protection.  The  discretionary  approach  under  the  1971  Act  did  not  provide  for  a  science  based process  for  including species on the endangered  list. Once  a  species appeared on  the discretionary list, there were no mandatory programs to protect species deemed to be  at risk nor were there programs to aid in recovery.  In addition, the Act did not take into  consideration  the  critically  important  roles  of  private  landowners  and  voluntary  stewardship in the protection and restoration of species and their habitats, nor did it take  indigenous knowledge  into consideration.  As a result of these combined  factors, it was  evident that Ontario was in urgent need of new endangered species legislation, and legal  reform  (MNR,  2006:  12).  The  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  1971  was  eventually  revised and rewritten.  It is now called the Endangered Species Act, 2007.

4.2 The Ontario Endangered Species Act, 2007  The  current  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007  (ESA,  2007)  was  passed  in  May  of  2007 and came into full force on June 30, 2008.  See table 4.3 for a detailed explanation  of the Act.  The ESA, 2007 was hailed as the best piece of endangered species legislation 
16  in the entire country  by  a  multitude of ENGOs and environmentalists.  The Act  is the 

first in Canada to include sciencebased listing in combination with mandatory protection  for threatened  and endangered species and their  habitats.  It offers  mechanisms such as  permits and agreements in order to encourage stewardship.  The permits and agreements  also allow for land use that would prove not to harm threatened and endangered species,  or the recovery of these species.  The new Act is significantly better at addressing species  at  risk  issues  in  comparison  to  the  previous  Act  because  it  follows  an  independent,  scientific and timely process for listing and protecting all species at risk, with the help of  COSSARO.  The new  legislation also  includes a  mandatory requirement to prepare and  carry  out  recovery  plans  for  threatened  and  endangered  species  as  well  as  management  plans for species of special concern.  It provides for the allocation of funds for species at  risk programs (MNR, 2007). 

4.2.2 Recovery and Management Plans  Recovery of species encompasses attempts to prevent further loss of a species at  risk.    Recovery  efforts  are  performed  in  order  to  reduce  threats  or  remove  them  altogether.    Once  a  species  is  deemed  to  be  at  risk  by  COSSARO,  the  government  is  responsible for outlining the steps that will be taken towards the recovery of the species.  The  ESA,  2007  requires  that  "recovery  strategies"  be  prepared  for  endangered  and  threatened species, while "management plans" are to be organized for species of special  concern.  The plans and strategies are organized, sciencebased plans that outline advice  for  the  government  and  recommend  steps  for  recovering  species  at  risk.    Recovery  strategies  include  information  that  is  pertinent  for  the  consideration  of  a  species'

recovery.    These  elements  include  habitat  needs,  existing  threats  to  the  species  or  ecosystem, recommended actions for protecting and recovering species and their habitats,  and  the  defined  area  that  is  considered  to  be  a  species'  habitat.    The  ESA,  2007  has  a  mandate for strict timelines for the preparation of recovery and management plans.  For  species listed as endangered, a recovery strategy must be set in place within one year of  its listing on the SARO.  For threatened species, a recovery strategy must be in existence  within  two  years  of  listing.    Species  of  special  concern  must  have  an  established  management  plan  within  five  years  of  listing  on  the  SARO,  unless  a  plan  is  already  in  place or in preparation by the federal government (MNR, 2010).  Recovery strategies are most often prepared by recovery teams.  These teams are  comprised  of  organized  groups  of  experts  usually  including  scientists  and  academic  researchers.    The  teams  are  responsible  for  using  the  most  relevant  and  best  available  scientific, community, and `Aboriginal Ecological Knowledge', or traditional knowledge,  in  order  to  recommend  the  best  possible  actions  for  preventing  the  decline  of  species  listed  as  being  at  risk  in  the  province  of  Ontario.    The  Ontario  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  is  currently  working  with  partners  on  recovery  projects  all  across  Ontario.  Some  partners  include  ENGOs,  educational  institutions  such  as  universities,  private  entities  and  donors,  in  conjunction  with  the  Ontario  MNR  and  funding  from  the  Endangered  Species  Recovery  Fund,  launched  by  WWFCanada  and  Environment  Canada in 1988.  Approximately 80 recovery teams are working to help curb the decline  of endangered and threatened species in the province (MNR, 2010).  Some examples of  recovery  efforts  include  the  recovery  teams  organized  for  the  Redside  Dace,  the  Woodland  Caribou,  the  Ontario  Badger,  the  Butternut,  the  Loggerhead  Shrike,  and  the  Jefferson  Salamander.    The  latter  two  will  be  discussed  in  the  Ontario  case  studies  described in Chapter 5.  Once  a  recovery  strategy  or  a  management  plan  is  in  place,  the  government  is  required to respond within 9 months of the completion of the documents.  The response  will provide a summary of actions that the government will take in order to accomplish  each strategy or plan.  At this point, the government must prioritize its impending actions.  Similar  to  the  SARA,  public  participation  is  incorporated  in  the  ESA,  2007.    The  Act  encourages  public  education  and  dissemination  of  information  as  responses  to recovery

56 

strategies and action plans are posted on the internet and made available for public review  and comment.  The responses are made available on the Ontario MNR website as well as 
17  the  Environmental  Registry  .    All  recovery  strategies  and  management  plans  are  also 

made public and posted on the registry (MNR, 2010). 

4.2.3 Stewardship Programs  One  of  the  main  goals  of  the  ESA,  2007  aside  from  the  use  of  sciencebased  listing  of  species  at  risk  and  the  protection  of  species  at  risk  and  their  habitats,  is  the  promotion  of  "stewardship  activities  to  assist  in  the  protection  and  recovery  of  species  that  are  at  risk"  (ESA,  2007,  c. 6,  s. 1.).   This  is  a  major  element  upon  which  the  ESA,  2007 places a  high priority, which was greatly  lacking  in the previous  legislation.   The  Species at Risk Stewardship Program was created to fulfill the high priority stewardship  component  of  the  Act.    The  program  encourages  all  citizens  of  Ontario  to  uphold  a  responsibility  for  the  conservation  of  biodiversity  and  the  protection  and  recovery  of  species  at risk.  The stewardship program  includes education and outreach components,  private landowner incentive programs, and funding for stewardship actions.  Private landowner support is a vital component of the protection of species at risk,  considering that a vast proportion exist on private lands.  Hence, voluntary conservation  efforts  are  imperative  to  species  at  risk  recovery.    The  Ontario  Species  at  Risk  Stewardship  fund  provides  a  total  of  $18  million  to  eligible  stewardship  projects,  composed of mostly protection and recovery activities.  These funds are guaranteed over  four  years,  from  2007  to  2011.    The  Stewardship  Fund  is  available  to  individuals  and  groups  across  the  province,  including  landowners,  farmers,  aboriginals,  academic  institutions,  conservation  organizations,  industries,  municipalities,  and  stewardship  councils.    Examples  of  some  projects  that  have  received  funding  include:    mapping  tallgrass prairie  habitat, restoring of  habitat by an aggregates company, and designing a  wireless system to track at risk turtle species (MNR, 2010).  Stakeholders  have expressed concern over the selection of  fund recipients  in the  20072008  and  20082009  fiscal  years,  because  not  enough  time  was  allocated  to  the

57 

consideration  of  applications  for  funding.    Recovery  teams  responsible  for  specific  species  at  risk  were  also  not  consulted  during  the  application  process.    In  addition,  the  majority  of  funded  projects  are  not  directly  linked  to  existing  recovery  plans.    Future  funding applicants are being encouraged to consult with MNR staff and species experts in  order to maximize fund allotments (Miller, 2009: 53).  Farmers play an especially important role in the conservation of species at risk in  Ontario.    With  this  understanding,  the  MNR  established  the  Species  at  Risk  Farm  Incentive Program (SARFIP) in 2008.  SARFIP is a costshare program that is funded by  the  Ontario  MNR.    The  program  specifically  targets  Ontario  farms  that  are  registered  under the CanadaOntario Environmental Farm Plan, so as to promote and encourage the  protection and conservation of habitat for species at risk (MNR, 2010).  Landowner stewardship is also being encouraged via the Conservation Land Tax  Incentive  Program  (CLTIP).    It  is  a  program  that  recognizes  and  supports  the  private  stewardship of provincially significant conservation lands in Ontario.  The strategy of the  program encompasses the granting of property tax relief to private landowners who agree  to  protect  the  integrity  of  natural  heritage  that  is  present  on  the  land.    Presently,  the  program is offering a 100% tax exemption on eligible areas of property.  The landowners  benefit  from  retaining  ownership  of  the  land  as  the  CLTIP  is  not  a  land  acquisition  program.    The  program  encourages  the  participation  of  private  landowners  while  instilling  stewardship  values  and  cooperation  for  the  preservation  of  Ontario's  natural  heritage and species at risk (MNR, 2010).  However, the MNR reserves participation to  landowners with only endangered species inhabiting their land.  There are no incentives  that exist for habitats of threatened species, or other species at risk.  Not all stakeholders  are benefitting from the program.  As of 2009, only 60 properties across Ontario actually  were  recipients  of  tax  relief  for  the  habitat  of  endangered  species  under  the  CLTIP  (Miller, 2009: 54).  At  the  outset,  the  new  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007  received  many  accolades  and  much  praise  from  numerous  environmental  organizations  and  academics.  However, due to the application of numerous exemptions, the Act has been the target of  much recent criticism.

Table 4.3:  Bill 184, [Ontario] Endangered Species Act, 2007 Explanatory Note  PURPOSES of the BILL  1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information,  including  information  obtained  from  community  knowledge  and  aboriginal  traditional knowledge.  2.  To  protect  species  that  are  at  risk  and  their  habitats,  and  to  promote  the  recovery of species that are at risk.  3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of  species that are at risk.  The  Committee  on  the  Status  of  Species  at  Risk  in  Ontario  (COSSARO)  is  continued. Its  members  must  be  persons  who  have  relevant  expertise  drawn  from  a  scientific  discipline  or  aboriginal  traditional  knowledge. COSSARO  is  required  to  assess  and  classify  species  and  to  report  the  classifications  to  the  responsible  Minister. The  Bill  sets  out  rules  for  classifying  species  as  extinct,  extirpated,  endangered,  threatened  or  special  concern  species. Classifications  must  be  based  on  the  best  available  scientific  information,  including  information  obtained  from  community  knowledge  and  aboriginal  traditional  knowledge. See sections 3 to 6.  A designated Ministry official is required to make and file a regulation (referred  to in the Bill as the Species at Risk in Ontario List) that lists all the species that  are  classified  by  COSSARO  as  extirpated,  endangered,  threatened  or  special  concern  species.  When  new  information  is  reported  to  the  Minister  by  COSSARO,  the  Ministry  official  must  amend  the  regulation  to  accurately  reflect the new information... See section 7 and Schedules 1 to 5.  PROTECTION AND  RECOVERY OF  SPECIES  If  a  species  is  listed  on  the  Species  at  Risk  in  Ontario  List  as  an  extirpated,  endangered or threatened species, the Bill prohibits killing, harming, harassing,  capturing,  taking,  possessing,  transporting,  collecting,  buying,  selling,  leasing,  trading  or  offering  to  buy,  sell,  lease  or  trade  a  member  of  the  species,  or  selling,  leasing,  trading  or  offering  to  sell,  lease  or  trade  anything  that  is  represented to be a member of the species... See Section 9.  If a species is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as an endangered or  threatened species, the Bill prohibits damaging or destroying the habitat of the  species... The regulations may specifically prescribe an area as the habitat of a  species  but,  if  no  habitat  regulation  is  in  force  with  respect  to  a  species,  "habitat"  is defined to mean an area on which the species depends, directly or  indirectly, to carry on its life processes... See Section 10 and 2 (definitions).  The Minister is required to ensure that a recovery strategy is prepared for each  species that is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as an endangered or  threatened species.... See Sections 11 to 15.  The  Minister  may  enter  into  agreements  for  the  purpose  of  assisting  in  the  protection  or  recovery  of  species  that  are  listed  on  the  Species  at  Risk  in  Ontario  List. Such  an  agreement  may  authorize  a  person  to  engage  in  an  activity that would otherwise be prohibited. See section 16.  The Minister  may also  issue a permit that authorizes a person to engage  in an
59

AGREEMENTS,  PERMITS and OTHER  INSTRUMENTS 

activity that would otherwise  be prohibited. These permits  may only  be  issued  in specified circumstances. See section 17.  If  specified  conditions  are  met,  instruments  issued  under  other  Acts  that  authorize  a  person  to  engage  in  an  activity  have  the  same  effect  as  a  permit  issued by the Minister under the Bill. See section 18.  Special  provisions  govern  agreements  and  permits  relating  to  aboriginal  people. See section 19.  Permits  issued  by  the  Minister  under  the  Bill  may  be  amended  or  revoked  in  specified  circumstances. If  the  Minister  intends  to  amend  or  revoke  a  permit  without the  consent of  the  holder  of  the  permit,  notice  must  be  given  and  the  holder  of  the  permit  may  require  that  a  hearing  be  held  before  the  Minister  makes a decision. See section 20.  ENFORCEMENT  The  Bill  contains  a  number  of  provisions  relating  to  enforcement.  These  include  provisions  designating  enforcement  officers  and,  in  specified  circumstances,  authorizing  them  to  conduct  inspections  and  searches. Orders  may  be  made  in  specified  circumstances. A  person  against  whom  an  order  is  made  may  require  that  a  hearing  be  held  and,  after  a  hearing  is  held,  the  Minister may confirm, amend or revoke the order. See sections 21 to 35.  A  contravention  of  specified  provisions  of  the  Bill,  or  of  provisions  of  agreements, permits or orders under the Bill, is an offence. A person cannot be  convicted  of  an  offence  if  the  person  establishes  that  the  person  exercised  all  due  diligence  to  prevent  the  commission  of  the  offence,  or  that  the  person  honestly  and  reasonably  believed  in  the  existence  of  facts  that,  if  true,  would  render the person's conduct innocent....  See sections 36 to 45.  The Bill  makes clear that  it does not abrogate or derogate from the protection  provided  for the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples  of  Canada  as  recognized  and  affirmed  in  section  35  of  the  Constitution  Act,  1982. See section 46.  The Species at Risk in Ontario Stewardship Program is established. Its purpose  is to promote stewardship activities that relate to species listed on the Species at  Risk in Ontario List...  See section 47.  COMMENCEMENT and  With  certain  minor  exceptions,  the  Bill  comes  into  force on  June  30,  2008  or  SHORT TITLE  such earlier day as may be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor.  The short title of the Bill is the Endangered Species Act, 2007. See sections 63  and 64.

4.3  Exemptions  and  Flexibility  Tools  in  the  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007  Although  it was to be considered the strongest legislation of  its kind  in Canada,  the Endangered Species Act, 2007 allows for some forms of flexibility via exceptions and  exemptions.    These  are  referred  to  as  "flexibility"  tools  by  the  MNR.  These  options  allow  for  the  legal  killing  of  species  at  risk  or  the  destruction  of  their  habitat  under  special  circumstances.    Permits,  agreements,  and  other  instruments  may  be  legally  granted under the  Act, while exemptions  may  be  created by regulation.  The  legislation  allows  for the  establishment  of  stewardship  agreements  "for  the  purpose  of  assisting  in  the  protection  or  recovery  of  a  species"  (ESA,  2007  c. 6,  s. 16 (1)).    Such  agreements  would allow for activities to occur that would otherwise be prohibited under the Act, but  would  be  deemed  permissible  based  on  long  term  recovery  goals.    Correspondingly,  permits allow activities to occur that would otherwise be prohibited by the Act.  A permit would be granted at the Minister's discretion if the main purpose of the  activity  is to ultimately assist  in the protection or recovery of a species at risk, or if the  Minister  decides  that  action  is  required  for  the  benefit  of  human  health  and  safety.  Similarly,  permits  may  be  issued  to  allow  otherwise  prohibited  activities  to occur.   For  instance, a permit may be granted if the Minister is of the opinion that the main purpose  of the permit is not related to the protection or recovery of a species at risk, but the permit  meets the following tests:
Â·  Â· 

an overall benefit to the species will be achieved within a reasonable time and, reasonable  alternatives  have  been  considered,  including  alternatives  that  would  not adversely affect the species, and the best alternative has been adopted and,

Â· 

reasonable steps to minimize any adverse affect are required as conditions of the  permit (Miller, 2009: 3435).  A  permit  would  also  be  granted  if  it  were  required  to  assist  in  the  recovery  or 

protection  of  a  species  at  risk,  such  as  stewardship  agreements  with  conservation  organizations.  An example would be a permit granted to allow an organization to carry  out a prescribed burn in order to restore habitat of a species at risk.  Also, a permit may  be  granted  where  an  activity  "will  result  in  significant  social  and  economic  benefit  to  Ontario"  (ESA,  2007  c. 6,  s. 16 (1)).    In  all  cases,  the  Minister  must  use  discretion  to

61 

ensure  that  the  ultimate  recovery  and  survival  of  a  species  will  not  be  compromised.  Information  regarding  permit  proposals  and  granted  permits  is  posted  on  the 
18  Environmental Registry. 

Once  granted,  exemptions  via  instruments  such  as  permits  or  approvals  can  be  granted if instruments were previously granted under other statutes.  Prohibited activities  may  be  allowed  to  occur  if  such  an  instrument  has  already  been  granted  under  other  existing provincial or federal statutes.  All of the above exemption instruments occur on a  casebycase  basis  and  take  place  at the  discretion  and  scrutiny  of  the  Minister  (Miller,  2009: 3435).  In July of 2008, soon after the Act came into force, some blanket exemptions to  the  provisions  of  the  Act  were  approved.    These  exemptions  can  be  granted  through  regulation  at  the  discretion  of  Cabinet.    They  can  apply  to  a  category  or  activity,  or  in  relation to specific species.  Ontario Regulation 242/08 was filed in June of 2008 so as to  coincide  with  the  coming  into  force  of  the  ESA,  2007.    The  regulation  allowed  for  23  exemptions  from  the  provisions  established  in  the  Act.    The  exemptions  fall  into  three  major  categories.    These  include  exemptions  for  numerous  major  industrial  and  development  sectors  exemptions  for  specific  activities  that  the  MNR  deems  are  not  harmful to species at risk and exemptions for emergency response, public safety, and law  enforcement.    As  outlined  by  the  regulation,  particular  exemptions  apply  to  several  specific  activities  on  an  ongoing  basis,  as  in  the  case  of  field  cultivation  of  American  ginseng  for  instance.    The  regulation  also  contains  a  limited,  predetermined  transition  period.  Within this time, activities are exempted from the provisions of the Act.  Once  the  time  has  elapsed,  the  activities  will  apply  and  be  prohibited.    An  example  of  this  occurs in the exemption granted to the commercial forestry industry (Miller, 2009: 38).  The regulation also facilitates the creation of agreements to exempt activities for  an  undetermined  amount  of  time.    These  agreements  apply  to  infrastructure  and  development.    Agreements  made  under  the  regulation  are  different  than  stewardship  agreements  as  instruments  under  the  Act.    Regulated  agreements  allow  the  complete  circumvention of key components of the Act.  They do not need to exist specifically for  the protection and recovery of species at risk.  Rather, they only require that reasonable 
18

62 

steps  be  taken  to  ensure  the  minimization  of  adverse  effects  on  species  at  risk,  that  survival or recovery  is  not made  vulnerable, and  that the agreements are  not in conflict  with any means that the Minister of Natural Resources intends to take to protect a species  (Miller, 2009: 39).  Specific exemptions that will negatively affect the vast majority of species at risk  that  are  slated  to  be  protected  under  the  Act  include  the  exemption  for  commercial  forestry on Crown lands, the exemptions for development and infrastructure, for pits and  quarries, and for hydroelectric generating stations (Miller, 2009: 3940).  For this reason,  they  are  considered  the  most  severe  and  intrusive  of  the  exemptions.    The  exemptions  have  the  potential  to  undermine  the  purpose  of  the  Act,  while  weakening  protective  measures. The  commercial  forestry  industry  was  granted  a  one  year  exemption  to the  Act,  until  June  30,  2009,  after  which  compliance  with  the  legislation  was  expected.    The  exemption allowed commercial timber harvesting on Crown lands, essentially permitting  the  industry  to  disregard  the  prohibitions  of  the  Act  associated  with  the  destruction  of  habitat  and  the  killing  of  species  at  risk  until  that  date.    However,  there  is  a  lack  of  current  information  on  the  expiry  of  this  exemption,  nor  on  a  possible  extension.    It  is  assumed  that  the  forestry  industry  is  allowed  to  continue  conducting  business  as  usual.  Presently, no public information is available on the status of extended exemptions beyond  June 30, 2009.  The industry continues to lobby intensely for a blanket exemption with no  expiry date (Kryzanowski, 2009).  The MNR has stated that "it is committed to working  with the forestry industry to harmonize its existing processes with the new Act" (Miller,  2009:  39).    There  are  59  species  at  risk  inhabiting  the  areas  of  Crown  lands  zoned  for  commercial forestry (ibid.).  Developers  were  granted  a  two  year  exemption,  until  June  30,  2010.    If  an  approval was completed prior to the coming into force of the ESA, 2007, the exemptions  to  certain types  of  development  and  infrastructure  apply  until  the  expiry  date.  Various  approvals  under  other  Acts  are  eligible  for  such  exemptions.    Some  examples  of  these  acts include the Planning Act, 1990, the Building Code Act, 1992, the Condominium Act,  1998,  the  Ontario  Energy  Board  Act,  1998,  the  Drainage  Act,  1990  and  the  Environmental  Assessment  Act,  1990.    The  exemptions  for  development  and

63 

infrastructure also apply to certain class environmental assessments as well as regulations  established under the Environmental Assessment Act, 1990 (Miller, 2009: 40).  Exemptions for aggregate extractors apply to all pits and quarries that obtained a  license prior to the coming into force of the ESA, 2007.  The exemptions are valid until  June 30, 2010.  The need for expiry dates or renewal has not yet been addressed in this  case (Miller, 2009: 40).  Ontario Regulation 242/08 permits the exemption of hydroelectric facilities from  the  prohibitions  outlined  in  the  Act.    The  prohibitions  are  not  applicable  until  the  third  year after a target species  is  listed on the SARO  or the third  year after the date that the  species  is  shown  to  exist  at  the  facility.    The  exemption  is  only  applicable  if  the  construction  of  the  facility  began  before  the  three  year  anniversary  date,  or  if  required  approvals  were  acquired  before  this  date.    For this  sector, there  is  no  exact  deadline  to  obtain  an  agreement  as  with  the  other  sectors  regulated  under  O.  Reg.  242/08,  and  the  need  for  an  expiry  date  and  renewal  is  not  specified  (Miller,  2009:  4041).    This  particular  exemption  applicable  to  the  hydroelectric  sector  will  severely  affect  endangered species in central and southern Ontario, where the majority of hydroelectric  facilities are situated (Ontario Nature, 2008).  A  very  broad  exemption  exists  within  the  regulation  that  potentially  permits  the  killing of species at risk or the destruction of their habitats where actions are permissible  if a person  "reasonably"  feels that there  is an  imminent risk to the safety or health of a  human  being  or  animal  (ibid.).    For  instance,  in  the  event  that  a  listed  species  at  risk  attacks a human being, endangering his or her life, the person is entitled to justifiably hurt  or kill the animal, sacrificing the species at risk in order to ensure their safety.  All  exemptions  are  ultimately  at  the  discretion  of  the  Minister  of  Natural  Resources.    For  information  on  all  23  exemptions,  refer  to  the  Ontario  Endangered 
19  Species Act, 2007 O. Reg. 242/08  .  The previously discussed industry exemptions have 

weakened the provisions of the Act and are undermining its purpose.  Under the previous  ESA, 1971, 42 species at risk of extinction and their habitats were fully protected.  As a  result  of  the  exemptions,  these  same  42  species  and  their  habitats  are  no  longer  fully

protected under the ESA, 2007.  This is because the exemptions now apply to the original  42 species listed under the outdated Act, which have been relisted under the ESA, 2007.  The previous  Act did not include such exemptions, and provided  full protection to each  of the 42 listed species.  The exemptions are essentially allowing the clock to be turned  back on endangered species protection in Ontario as protection of the 42 species has been  weakened by the exemptions, rather than fortified.  Municipal  jurisdictions also play an  active role  in endangered species protection  in  the  province  of  Ontario.    Land  use  planning  by  each  municipality  decides  the  future  outlook  of  a  community,  as  certain  areas  are  allocated  for  development  and  others  are  slated  for  conservation.    Official  plans  provide  broad  instructions  for  community  planning  and  land  use  for  1020  years.    They  usually  include  natural  heritage  policies  governing  features  such  as  wildlife  habitat,  wetlands,  woodlands,  and  rare  species  or 
20  species at risk.  Under the Planning Act, 1990  , the Provincial Policy Statement provides 

a  guide  for  the  development  of  Official  Plans  and  other  planning  documents.  Consequentially, municipalities are guided in the development of private lands via zoning  bylaws,  site  plan  control,  subdivision  plans,  severances,  and  other  land  use  decisions. 
21  The  Provincial  Policy  Statement  issued  under  Section  3  of  the  Planning  Act,  1990 

provides  direction  on  ensuring  species  at  risk  and  their  habitats  are  considered  in  municipal  landuse  planning  and  that  they  are  protected  when  areas  are  developed.  Section  2.1.3  of  the  Provincial  Policy  Statement  indicates  that  "development  and  site  alteration  shall  not  be  permitted  in  significant  habitat  of  endangered  species  and  threatened  species".    This  is  significant  as  it  is  in  line  with  the  provisions  of  the  ESA,  2007.    In  addition,  the  Provincial  Policy  Statement  goes  beyond  many  stewardship  incentive programs under the ESA, 2007 which only guarantee funding for owners of land  that  consists  of  habitat  of  `endangered'  species.    The  Provincial  Policy  Statement  also  stresses  the  importance  of  preserving  the  habitat  of  `threatened'  species.    Hence,  the  significance  of  attempting  to  protect  species  when  they  are  threatened  is  highlighted.

Protective measures at this stage may prevent these species from becoming `endangered'  in the future.  Now that all existing legal and policy instruments in Ontario that are dedicated to  the  protection  of  species  at  risk  have  been  reviewed,  two  individual  case  studies  of  species at risk in Ontario are analyzed in Chapter 5.  The effectiveness of existing legal  tools and the importance of scientific fact as an informative framework for these tools are  also evaluated.

66 

CHAPTER 5.0 ONTARIO SPECIES AT RISK: TWO CASE STUDIES  Case studies of two specific Ontario species at risk were evaluated to discover if  existing protectionist measures and legal tools, as well as proposed reforms in the Ontario  Endangered Species Act, 2007 are sufficient for protecting species at risk.  Two  cases  of  endangered  species  in  Ontario  are  analyzed  individually:    the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  and  the  Jefferson  Salamander.    They  are  both  listed  as  endangered  on  the  SARA  public  registry  and  are  important  indicators  of  environmental  health.  The decline of these species denotes environmental and ecosystem deterioration.  In particular, the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike was also selected for study because it is one  of the original 42 species listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act, 1971. 

5.1 The Eastern Loggerhead Shrike  5.1.1 A Songbird on the Precipice of Extinction:  Indicator of Southern Ontario  Landscape Health  The Eastern Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans) is an indicator of  the  health  of  open  field  savanna  grassland,  tallgrass  prairie,  and  alvars,  as  it  nests  and  survives in these locales (Yosef, 1996: 279 Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2008: 9).  Over  the  years,  and  with  an  increase  in  the  size  and  density  of  the  human  population  in  southern  and  central  Ontario,  much  development  and  urbanization  has  consequently  taken place, vastly degrading these ecosystems.  The presence and health of the Eastern  Loggerhead Shrike provides a signpost for the fate of the remaining fragile and sensitive  areas of prairie, savanna, and alvars in southern Ontario.  However, the species tends to  be mostly found within alvars, as areas of tallgrass prairie and savanna have disappeared,  with  few  areas  remaining,  consisting  of  less  than  three  percent  of  their  original  range  (Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2008: 9).  Preservation efforts that allow for the recovery  of  this  endangered  species  can  be  extrapolated  to  other  species  that  occupy  the  last  remaining  tracts.    It  is  thus  beneficial  to  conduct  a  focused  case  study  on  an  indicator  species that is representative of a disappearing ecosystem and the other species that rely  on the same  habitat  for survival.  Any conclusions and policy recommendations will  be  applicable  to  many  other  species  at  risk.    This  case  study  focuses  on  the  status  of  the

67 

Eastern Loggerhead shrike as an  indication of the effectiveness of existing policy tools,  and the reliability and availability of scientific information to inform these instruments. 

5.1.2 Ecological Traits and Habitat Requirements  The Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) has suffered a very severe decline  over the last 50 years.  There are eleven subspecies of Loggerhead Shrike in existence in  North  America.    Two  subspecies  currently  exist  and  breed  in  Canada:    the  Prairie  Loggerhead  Shrike  (Lanius  ludovicianus  excubitorides)  and  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  (Lanius  ludovicianus  migrans)  (Chabot  et  al.,  2001  Telfer,  2010).   The  Eastern 
22  Loggerhead Shrike  has suffered the  most severe declines of the two.  It is endemic to 

very  small  pockets  of  Manitoba  and  is  found  mostly  in  Ontario.    A  very  unique  subspecies, it is the only predatory songbird, or passerine, that exists in Ontario.  As such,  it  is  an  important  top  predator  in  the  food  web  and  it  holds  individual  ecosystem  importance.  It hunts for prey, and its diet consists of larger insects as well as mice, small  snakes,  and  other  small  birds.    It  consumes  large  quantities  of  major  agricultural  pests  such  as  grasshoppers,  field  mice,  and  meadow  voles  (ibid.).    It  is  also  known  as  the  "butcher  bird"  because  of  its  hunting  instincts,  whereby  it  impales  its  prey  on  sharp  thorns and barbed wire to assist in tearing the food apart before consumption.  The Eastern Loggerhead Shrike was once a very common subspecies in southern  Canada.    Its  range  spanned  from  southeastern  Manitoba,  across  southern  Ontario  and  Quebec, and into the Maritime provinces.  It now only nests in some pockets of southern  Ontario  and  southeastern  Manitoba.    In  Ontario,  persistent  habitat  loss  has  forced  the  shrike to nest in limestone plains at the southern edge of the Canadian Shield (Chabot et  al., 2001 Royal Ontario Museum, 2008).  Specifically, these core areas of the Canadian  Shield are the Carden Plain, northeast of Lake Simcoe the Napanee Plain, just north of  Lake Ontario in the Kingston area and the Smith's Falls Plain, in eastern Ontario (ibid.).  Figure  5.1  below  shows  the  approximate  locations  of  these  three  core  areas  within  the  shrike's historic breeding range in Ontario (Bird Studies Canada, n.d.).

5.1.3 Current Status and Causes of Decline  Of  all  North  American  songbirds,  grassland  species  like  the  Loggerhead  Shrike  are  undergoing  the  most  drastic  decline  in  numbers  (Chabot  et  al.,  2001  Stutchbury,  2007:  115).    The  decline  of  grassland  birds  is  more  pronounced  than  that  of  forest  songbirds.  Native  grasslands  are  among  the  most  endangered  ecosystems  in  North  America  because  they  are  easily  converted  into  land  for  agricultural  purposes  or  slated  for  development.    More  than  90  percent  of  tallgrass  prairie  and  savanna  has  been  lost,  correlating with the  local extinctions of  Loggerhead Shrike all  across the Canadian and  American western prairies.   With the disappearance of  native grasslands, songbirds that  were  originally  adapted  to  the  native  landscape  have  been  forced  to  adapt  to  an  assortment of habitat types.  Presently,  with  the  disappearance  of  all  but  tiny  fragments  of  native  grasslands,  birds such as the Loggerhead Shrike are  forced to survive on agricultural  lands.  There,  the habitat is poorer in quality and severely altered by heavy grazing and mowing.  May  and  June are trying  months  for the survival of  young  nestlings.  This  is when  hayfields

69 

are mowed, obliterating the nests of grassland birds such as the shrike (Stutchbury, 2007:  183184). The  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  is  declining  in  number  faster  than  any  other  grassland  bird  in  North  America.    The  exact  reason  for  the  decline  of  the  Loggerhead  Shrike is unknown.  However, it has been suggested that a combination of various factors  including  habitat  loss,  pesticide  exposure,  increased  predation,  and  car  strikes  have  contributed  to  the  decline.    Scientists  have  not  yet  been  able  to  determine  the  exact  number or reasons why the birds suffer fatalities at the hatchling stage, preventing them  from reaching maturity (Telfer, 2010).  Habitat  loss  is  a  major  threat to the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  and  it  poses  the  greatest  danger.    Over  the  second  half  of  the  last  century,  intensive  farming  and  conversion of grasslands to farmland, natural succession, reforestation, and development  have all drastically reduced the amount of habitat available to the species.  Younger and  inexperienced  shrikes  are  also  susceptible  to  car  strikes,  particularly  when  they  are  nesting and breeding in roadside fields and edges.  When they swoop across roadways to  catch prey, they are also susceptible to being killed by vehicles (Nature Conservancy of  Canada, 2006 Wildlife Preservation Canada, 2008).  Chemicals  such  as  pesticides  can  infiltrate  the  bird's  food  sources.    This  is  because  shrikes  forage  and  breed  near  agricultural  fields  where  chemicals  are  often  applied  to  control  pests.    The  Loggerhead  Shrike  is  a  species  that  prefers  to  dwell  in  grasslands,  but  is  forced  to  thrive  in  and  around  farmland,  as  grasslands  are  being  converted to agricultural lands and residential lands at alarming rates (Stutchbury, 2007:  117).  Poisoned  birds  are  more  susceptible  to  dying  from  collisions  with  buildings,  fences, or other objects, and are more easily hit by passing cars (Stuchbury, 2007: 119).  Many  modern  pesticides  are  hormone  disruptors  that  can  negatively  affect  fertility  and  reproduction.    All  possible  sublethal  effects  of  pesticides  are  not  entirely  known,  but  some are thought to impede  normal embryonic development and cause thinning of egg  shells (Bartuszevige et al., 2002 Stuchbury, 2007: 121, 123).  In  conjunction  with  habitat  loss  and  car  strikes,  high  levels  of  predation  on  Loggerhead Shrike young have also placed the population in peril.  Nest predation tends

70 

to  be  very  high  in  open  grasslands.    Birds  that  prefer  to  nest  in  grasslands,  like  the  Loggerhead  Shrike,  are  easier  prey.    Subsequently,  birds  that  nest  in  smaller  grassland  patches are more readily preyed upon than those that nest in more optimal, larger areas of  grassland  (Friesen  et  al.,  1999  Winter  and  Faaborg,  1999  Burke  and  Nol,  2000  Stutchbury,  2007:  183184).    This  was  confirmed  by  a  largescale  study  of  remaining  native grassland  fragments  in the 1990s.  The study  focused on  four common grassland  birds  and  looked  at  more  than  three  thousand  nests  in  thirtynine  grassland  fragments  ranging in size from a tiny 24 hectare to 40 000 hectare preserves.  It was concluded that  nest  predation  was  vastly  higher  in  the  smaller  fragments  where  four  out  of  every  five  nests were destroyed (ibid.).  Loggerhead Shrikes are not only easily accessible to natural predators in the wild  they  are  also  susceptible  to  attacks  by  domestic  and  feral  cats.    Felines  that  prowl  grasslands in search of mice, hunt in the same habitat where shrikes live, nest, and hunt.  Domestic  cats  that  are  permitted  outdoors  are  a  major  predator  of  birds  that  nest  in  suburban and rural agricultural areas.  One particular study observed that every domestic  cat kills on average one bird per week (Stutchbury, 2007: 174175).  Considering the vast  numbers  of  domestic  and  feral  cats  in  Ontario,  the  number  of  dead  songbirds  is  unimaginable, and may possibly number in the millions.  Although cats only follow their  natural  hunting  instincts, their predation on  birds  is  not a natural part of the ecosystem,  and  they  have  never  been  a  natural  part  of  the  food  chain  in  Canada.    They  were  introduced to North America with the arrival of the Europeans and became popular in the  1800s (CWS, 2009a Stutchbury, 2007: 174175).  The combination of pressures on Eastern Loggerhead Shrike populations has led  to  significant  declines  in  numbers.    At  present,  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  is  considered  to  be  critically  endangered  in  Canada  under  COSEWIC  and  it  is  also  listed  under  the  federal  Species  at  Risk  Act  (Telfer,  2010).    The  species  is  also  listed  as  endangered  on  the  SARO  and  under  the  Ontario  ESA,  2007.  As  of  2009,  there  were  approximately  only  31  breeding  pairs  remaining  in  the  wild  in  Ontario.    This  is  an  encouraging  number  considering that 28  breeding pairs were  counted  in the wild  in the  preceding  year, and only 19 the  year before that.  However, as illustrated in Figure 5.2,

71 

healthy populations are yet to stabilize and numbers of breeding pairs remain dangerously  low (Nature Conservancy of Canada, 2006 Wildlife Preservation Canada, 2008).

Figure 5.2:  Population Monitoring of Eastern Loggerhead Shrike Breeding Pairs  (Population Size is determined in numbers of breeding pairs).  [Source:  Wildlife Preservation Canada, 2010]  The Eastern Loggerhead Shrike is an attractive charismatic subspecies that has a  large amount of public appeal.  As such, there has been a great deal of mobilization over  the  last  decade  to  attempt  to  protect  the  species.    Considering  the  few  breeding  pairs  remaining in Ontario, there is evidence that the efforts have not been successful thus far  (Wildlife Preservation Canada, 2008).  Taking  into consideration that habitat  loss  is the  primary  cause  of  the  disappearance  of  the  species,  some  efforts  have  been  made  to  protect existing habitat and plans to establish new habitat for the Loggerhead Shrike are  in existence (ibid.).  Monitoring  of  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  population  numbers  in  the  wild  has  been occurring since 1991.  In 1993, a national Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Team was  established.    It  later  branched  into  two  groups,  one  responsible  for  the Eastern

72 

Loggerhead  Shrike  Recovery  Program  and  the  other  for  the  Prairie  Loggerhead  Shrike  Recovery  Program.  Members  of  the  groups  include  representatives  from  the  Canadian  Wildlife  Service,  provincial  wildlife  agencies,  environmental  nongovernmental  organizations  (ENGOs),  the  Canadian  Cattlemen's  Association,  some  provincial  cattlemen's associations, a few universities, and the Toronto Zoo, as well as a number of  private landowners (Telfer, 2010).  The ultimate goal of the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike  Recovery  Strategy  is  to  increase  the  population  nesting  in  Eastern  Canada  to  a  self  sustaining number of a minimum of 500 breeding pairs (WPC, 2005).  Much  research  on  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  populations  continues,  including  population  monitoring,  bird  banding,  DNA  studies,  and  the  establishment  of  captive  breeding  programs.    A  fundamental  portion  of  the  recovery  strategy  involves  the  formation of  various Recovery  Action Groups (RAGs)  for each of the six core existing  areas of shrike habitat.  Each group concerns itself with coordinating shrike recovery in  its  area.    Some  examples  of  RAG  activities  include  the  organization  of  habitat  stewardship  programs,  outreach  and  education  programs,  community  groups,  farming  organizations,  and  naturalist  clubs  (Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  Recovery,  n.d.).    In  essence,  the  primary  goal  of  the  Loggerhead  Shrike  Recovery  Action  Groups  is  to  coordinate  landowner  stewardship  efforts.    This  is  extremely  important  because  almost  every  breeding  pair  in  Ontario  is  found  on  private  property.    Government  support,  subsidization, and funding for private land stewardship are imperative for the promotion  of Loggerhead Shrike conservation and recovery.  There is a constant need for additional  support from governments, groups, and individuals for the protection of existing habitat,  and for the establishment of new habitat, if the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike is to overcome  the looming possibility of extinction (Telfer, 2010).  A  captive  breeding  program  for  the  bird  is  currently  in  existence.    The  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  captive  breeding  program  was  started  by  Environment  Canada  in  1997.    Fortythree  nestlings  were  captured  in  1997  and  1998  in  order  to  establish  two  breeding  populations  located  at  the  Toronto  Zoo  and  at  the  Avian  Science  and  Conservation  Centre  at  McGill  University  in  Montreal.    The  captive  population  now  numbers  more  than  100.    The  goal  of  the  program  is  to  use  captive  populations  to  re  establish populations in the wild, once actual causes of species decline are identified, and

73 

in turn become manageable.  Since 2001, 221 captivebred shrikes were released into the  wild.  Two females that were released the previous year were found to successfully breed  in the wild the following year, proving that captivebred birds can migrate, overwinter,  and return to breed.  However, not enough captivebred shrikes have had this success in  the  wild.    More  must  be  understood  about  the  factors  and  dynamics  that  affect  the  interactions between captivebred and wild shrikes alongside the interaction of causes of  the decline of wild populations (Eastern Loggerhead Shrike Recovery, n.d.).  Also, many 
23  scientists question the genetic viability of captivebred animals.  Thus, the plight of the 

Easter Loggerhead Shrike is still riddled with much scientific uncertainty.  In addition, there are other biodiversity issues with regards to species at risk.   A  population numbering in small sizes, as is often the case with species at risk, endangered  species,  and  captivebred  populations,  can  encounter  genetic  diversity  issues.    Such  populations  are  susceptible  to  genetic  drift,  or  the  "random  fluctuation  in  gene  frequencies that occur as a result of  nonrepresentative combinations of gametes created  during  breeding."    Drift  can  lead  to  the  loss  of  genetic  variation  and  diversity  (Berry,  1971 Van Dyke, 2003: 115).  Small populations are also susceptible to increased rates of  inbreeding  due  to  a  greater  probability  of  individuals  of  aboveaverage  relatedness  interbreeding  (Franklin,  1980 Frankel  and  SoulÃ©,  1981  Van  Dyke,  2003:  116).   These  problems eventually lead to a population bottleneck.  Once a bottleneck takes place in a  small  population,  "the  remaining  individuals  represent  only  a  sample  of  the  original  source population."  They are no longer an adequate genetic representation of the original  source, accounting for a loss in genetic variation and diversity (Frankel and SoulÃ©, 1981  Van Dyke, 2003: 115).  As  is  evident  from  population  censuses  that  have  been  occurring  since  1991,  populations  had  been  steadily  declining,  and  have  recently  become  unstable,  increasing  slightly some years and decreasing other years (See Figure 5.2).  This instability indicates  that populations are not yet fully recovering, and there is still a long way to go.  Hence,  the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike is still likely susceptible to extinction.  Efforts to restore  wild populations that have  been taking place since  monitoring  began are not deemed to

74 

be  successful  as  the  ultimate  goal  of  500  breeding  pairs  in  the  wild  is  still  far  from  attainment.  The Eastern Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Program has been funded mostly at the  federal  level  by  Environment  Canada,  with  funds  destined  for  habitat  stewardship  programs.    The  Ontario  Species  at  Risk  Stewardship  Fund  and  private  donations  have  also fuelled the recovery program throughout its  years of existence.  In 2007,  however,  federal  funds  to  the  program  were  cut,  which  placed  the  program  in  a  predicament  to  continue with a greater reliance on private donations. 

5.1.4 Existing Legal Measures for the Protection of the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike  The  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  is  fully  protected  under  the  federal  Migratory  Birds  Convention  Act,  1994,  the  Species  at  Risk  Act,  and  the  recently  enacted  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007.    Shrike  nesting  habitat  is  protected  under  the  Ontario  Planning Act, 1990 whereby  it  is  noted in the  natural  heritage portion of the Provincial  Policy Statement associated with the Act that a municipality must not allow the alteration 
24  of  "significant  habitat  of  endangered  and  threatened  species"  .  Based  on  the  Policy 

Statement, a 400 metre radius wherein development is not permitted has been applied by  the Ontario MNR around any Loggerhead Shrike nest site (Stauffer, 2007).  The shrike has the benefit of being protected under two acts that were specifically  created to target species at risk issues at both the provincial and federal levels.  Hence, it  is  legally  protected  by  multiple  jurisdictions  (Telfer,  2010).    Unfortunately,  the  extra  layers of protection it should receive from the various jurisdictions are not having a very  positive effect on existing populations (see fluctuations in Figure 5.2).  Under the SARA, every year, the federal Habitat Stewardship Program for Species  at  Risk  (HSP)  provides  funding  to  support  species  recovery  nationwide.    Annually,  the  federal HSP provides approximately $2 million for species recovery in Ontario.  In order  to be eligible for funding, the amount must be matched, either financially or "in kind" by  the recipient organization.  HSP projects are established to aid in the recovery of species  at  risk  by  supporting  actions  outlined  in  recovery  strategies,  action  plans,  and 

24 

Provincial Policy Statement under the Ontario Planning Act, 1990.  2005. Available <  http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Asset1421.aspx >

75 

management  plans  prepared  under  the  SARA  (Environment  Canada,  2007).    The  SARA  provides support and funding to the Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Program via the HSP.  The  HSP  grants  funding  to  Wildlife  Preservation  Canada,  which  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  recovery  strategy,  including  monitoring,  captive  breeding  and  releasing,  habitat  mapping,  stewardship  and  restoration,  and  public  education.    Federal  funds  are  being  allocated  towards  habitat  stewardship  and  enhancement,  landowner  contact,  communication,  and  outreach.    Environment  Canada  has  also  confirmed  that  it  will  provide  some  financial  support  for  the  captive  breeding  program  and  for  the  maintenance of the captive population (Wildlife Preservation Canada, 2008).  In 2008, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources' Species at Risk Stewardship  fund granted $83,500.00 to shrike recovery.  These funds were allocated from the Species  at Risk Stewardship  Fund.   Provincial  funds are  being allotted towards wild population  monitoring and habitat stewardship projects (Wildlife Preservation Canada, 2008).  Apart from support for shrike recovery from Environment Canada and the federal  and provincial stewardship funds, most of the support received by Wildlife Preservation  Canada  for  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  Recovery  Strategy  originates  from  private  donors.    Shrike  recovery  efforts  would  not  be  possible  without  private  donations  (Wildlife Preservation Canada, 2008).  In order for population  numbers to  increase, the  recovery  program  must  be  allowed  to  continue,  and  it  may  only  do  so  via  adequate  funding.  Although the Ontario Endangered Species Act, 2007 was originally applauded as  one  of  the  strongest  pieces  of  endangered  species  legislation  in  existence,  the  twenty  three exemptions approved in July of 2008 undermine its effectiveness.  The exemptions  for  forestry,  aggregate  extraction,  hydro,  and  development  affect  species  like  the  Loggerhead  Shrike,  that  were  initially  afforded  complete  scientificallybased  habitat  protection under the ESA, 2007 prior to the introduction of O. Reg. 242/08.  Specifically,  the  exemptions  for  aggregate  and  hydro  industries  as  well  as  development  have  the  potential to severely affect endangered species in southern and central Ontario.  Under the Endangered Species Act, 1971, 42 species were listed and their habitats  were to be  fully protected.  Although there was  no scientific  basis  for  listing  species as  endangered  under  this  Act,  once  a  species  was  listed  it  was  fully  protected  without

76 

subjection  to  exemptions.    The  exemptions  to  the  ESA,  2007  no  longer  grant  these  42  species  the  same  degree  of  protection  they  originally  had  under  the  outdated  Act.   The  Eastern Loggerhead Shrike is one of these 42 species.  The legislation is taking one step  in  reverse,  to  its  detriment,  instead  of  moving  forward  to  improve  endangered  species  protection.    Hence,  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  habitat  is  subject to  certain  exemptions,  placing its ultimate survival in the wild in danger (Ontario Nature, 2008). 

5.1.5 Implementation Gaps  As  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  is  a  migratory  bird,  the  responsibility  for  its  legal protection falls well within federal jurisdiction as well as provincial jurisdiction.  At  the federal level, the most important piece of legislation with specific regard to species at  risk  is  the  Species  at  Risk  Act.   Its  influence  extends  only  to  species  located on  federal  lands,  or  to  aquatic  species  and  those  protected  under  the  Migratory  Birds  Convention  Act,  1994 (SARA,  2002  34(2)).   In  the  case  of  the  Loggerhead  Shrike,  there  are  so  few  individuals  remaining  in  the  wild,  that the  possibility  of  individuals  residing  on  federal  Crown,  or  public,  territory  is  very  slim.    Most  of  the  remaining  populations  reside  on  private lands held by private landowners.  In October of 1996, all jurisdictions in Canada ratified a national approach for the  protection of the country's species at risk.  The agreement, known as the National Accord  for  the  Protection  of  Species  at  Risk,  was  sanctioned  by  the  federal,  provincial,  and  territorial  governments  in  a  commitment  to  preserve  Canada's  species  at  risk.    In  the  accord,  a  great  emphasis  is  placed  on  the  importance  of  stewardship  in  combating  the  plight of species at risk (The Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk Backgrounder,  n.d.).  As outlined in the Species at Risk Act, the federal Minister of the Environment can  "enter  into  a  conservation  agreement  with  any  government  in  Canada,  organization  or  person  to  benefit  a  species  at  risk  or  enhance  its  survival  in  the  wild."  (SARA,  2002  11(1)).    Under  the  Act,  and  resulting  from  the  National  Accord,  there  is  much  cooperation  and overlap  between the  various  jurisdictions with regard to species at risk  policy instruments.  As specified in the Act, the federal government is required to allocate  funding  for  the  recovery  of  endangered  species  from  the  federal  Habitat  Stewardship  Fund.

77 

In  the  fall  of  2007,  Federal  Environment  Minister  John  Baird  announced  that  funds  were  to  be  cut  in  the  budget  of  Environment  Canada.    The  programs  affected  include  the  Canadian  Wildlife  Service  along  with  the  Migratory  Bird  Program,  whose  budget  was  cut  by  fifty  percent.    The  budget  allocated  for  National  Wildlife  Areas,  a  program  that  protects  significant  wildlife  habitats,  has  been  completely  eliminated,  dropping from $1.9 million to zero (CBC, 2007).  In the case of the Eastern Loggerhead  Shrike,  these  funding  cuts  affected  the  20082009  and  20092010  recovery  effort  field  seasons, with even greater repercussions to possibly occur in the future.  No reasons were  given  to  justify  the  funding  cutbacks  except that the  office  of  the  Environment  Minster  indicated  that  funding  was  to  be  siphoned  to  priorities  in  climate  change  initiatives  (ibid.).  In essence, shrike recovery  is  being  made possible  mostly as a result of private  donations,  underlining  the  increasing  reliance  on  external  private  sources  to  aid  this  endangered  species,  and  emphasizing  the  decrease  in  government  funding.    In  fact, the  20092010  field  seasons  for  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  recovery  efforts  are  only  being  permitted  to  continue  mainly  due  to  private  "bridge  funding"  from  a  major  corporate donor (Hess, 2009: 32).  Hence, the federal budget cuts jeopardize the future of  the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike, and many other endangered species in Canada (Wildlife  Preservation Canada, 2007).  The  federal  government  is  reneging  on  its  obligation  to  aid  in  the  best  possible  manner in the recovery of species at risk, as outlined in SARA.  In the case of the shrike,  without  adequate  funding  from  the  Habitat  Stewardship  Fund,  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  recovery  effort  faces  an  uncertain  future,  essentially  placing  the  survival  of  the  species in dire circumstances (Canadian Association of Zoos in Ontario, 2009).  The  federal  government  also  has  a  responsibility  for  protecting  all  Canadian  migratory  birds,  including  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike,  under  the  Migratory  Birds  Convention Act, 1994.  Although the Act strictly prohibits the harming of migratory birds  and  the  disturbance  or  destruction  of  their  nests and  eggs,  these  actions  may  still  occur  unintentionally  via  commercial  activities.    Such  activities  include  mining,  forestry  and  agriculture,  electrical  generation  and  transmission,  fishing,  infrastructure  management,  and  urban  development.    Destruction  resulting  from  these  activities  is  referred  to  as

78 

"incidental take".  This form of destruction is illegal in accordance with the MBCA, 1994  (CWS, 2009b).  Where some activities are illegal at the level of federal jurisdiction, they may be  deemed  to  be  legal  under  provincial  jurisdiction.    This  is  when  jurisdictional  overlap  becomes  a  major  implementation  gap.    In  this  case,  a  federal  Act  prohibits  certain  activities  while  a  provincial  Act,  the  ESA,  2007,  via  permit  and  regulation,  may  allow  such activities and facilitate the action of "incidental take".  For instance, the exemptions  to the ESA, 2007 under Ontario Regulation 242/08 that were previously mentioned above  allow  for  the  legal  conduct  of  many  activities  where  "incidental  take"  is  possible.    For  example, pits and quarries had been exempted until June 30, 2010 from the prohibitions  of the ESA, 2007 relating to the destruction of  habitat and the killing of  species at risk.  The  ESA,  2007  exemptions  facilitate  the  possibility  of  committing  a  prohibited  act  according to the MBCA, 1994.  In this case, the two jurisdictions confound one another.  This scenario is but one example of the problems that may arise in the Canadian political  system  that  is  founded  on  the  premise  of  separation  of  powers  as  directed  by  the  constitution.  Jurisdiction  is  a  major  obstacle  to  implementation  of  policy  however,  many  obstacles are present within the same jurisdiction as well.  For instance, some statutes in  the  province  of  Ontario  may  authorize  activities  that  may  be  prohibited  under  other  Ontario  statutes.    A  case  in  point  is  evident  where  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007  allows  for  the  occurrence  of  prohibited  activities  if  an  instrument,  such  as  a  permit  or  approval,  has  been  issued  under  other  provincial  or  federal  statutes,  and  prescribed  general conditions have been met.  These conditions are the same as those that apply to  permits issued directly under the ESA, 2007:  that an overall benefit to a species will be  achieved, reasonable alternatives have been considered and the best alternative has been  adopted,  and  reasonable  steps  to  minimize  adverse  affects  are  required  as  conditions  of  the  permit.  For  all  instruments  that  are  applicable  under  other  legislation,  the  Minister  must  be  of  the  opinion  that  these  conditions  were  met  at  the  time  the  instrument  was  issued or approved.  The problem with this method of approval is that other Acts do not  take  conservation  and  preservation  into  consideration  in  the  same  manner  as  the  ESA,  2007 does (Miller, 2009: 36).  Hence, any habitat destruction that may legally take place

79 

under, for instance, the Ontario Aggregate Resources Act, 1990, will not necessarily take  into  consideration  the  conservation  of  a  species  at  risk  when  undertaking  the  lawful  destruction  of  their  habitat  in  the  same  manner  as  such  an  exemption  or  permit  would  allow under the ESA, 2007.  Implementation  gaps  are  also  evident  within  single  pieces  of  legislation  and  policy.  For instance, the recent exemptions to the Ontario Endangered Species Act, 2007  will  prove  damaging  to  the  preservation  of  species  and  will  specifically  harm  the  recovery effort for the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike.  Defeating the purpose of the revisions  to the statute, the Act will no longer grant full protection towards the habitats of species  at  risk,  one  of  the  defining  elements  that  represented  the  laudable  nature  of  the  new  legislation.  Industries that qualify  for the exemptions  are no  longer required to explore  all available options to justify their activities.  The exemptions allow business to operate  as  usual,  in  complete  disregard  for  endangered  species.    Permits  and  other  instruments  were created to enable activities that would not otherwise be permitted under the Act, and  guarantee that the activities would still foster stewardship, protection, or rehabilitation of  a species.  When exemptions are permitted without the requirement of such instruments,  the purpose of their creation is undermined.  For instance, permits give industries higher  standards  for  conducting  business  while  protecting  a  species.    Exemptions  facilitate the  process of allowing certain industries to ignore endangered species.  Even the use of permits can pose implementation gaps if extreme care and caution  are  not  taken.    It  is  imperative  to  ensure  that  flexibility  tools  such  as  permits  and  agreements  do  not  become  loopholes  for  business  to  function  as  usual  within  the  framework of the legislation.  The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario also warns of  taking  extreme  caution  in  authorizing  the  limited  use  of  these  flexibility  tools  and  exceptions while ensuring that the purpose of the ESA, 2007, the protection and recovery  of species at risk, is not undermined (Miller, 2009: 35).  Hence, it is crucial that the law  does not become too permissive  in  favour of economic  interests.  This could ultimately  undermine the purpose of the legislation (Illical and Harrison, 2007).  A major obstacle to the implementation of policy and legislation is the willingness  to  cooperate  on  behalf  of  a  significant  actor:   the  private  landowner.    The  Endangered  Species Act, 1971 did not include any stewardship incentives for the protection of species

80 

deemed  to  be  at  risk  under  the  Act.    No  flexibility  tools,  recovery  strategies,  or  stewardship support existed.  The only options for conservation of species listed as being  at  risk  were  along  the  lines  of  command  and  control,  such  as  the  enforcement  of  strict  fines,  as  opposed  to  more  permissive  voluntary  stewardship  initiatives  and  flexibility  instruments, such as permits and regulations.  Thus, a culture has flourished among some  private landowners to rid their properties of endangered species so as not to deal with the  consequences.  These actions are often coined as "shoot, shovel, and shutup" (Helferty,  2007).  The  new Endangered Species Act, 2007 attempts to stimulate  more  involvement  in  species  protection  on  behalf  of  the  private  landowner  and  includes  a  voluntary  stewardship element, relying less on harsh command and control with punitive elements,  as was the case under the old Act.  Even so, if an endangered species such as the Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  establishes  habitat  and  nests  on  private  land,  Ontario  municipal  law  states  that  a  400  metre  radius  must  be  preserved  wherein  interference  with  the  endangered  species  is  not  permitted,  as  previously  stated  above  (Stauffer,  2007).    As  such, some private landowners are still spurred to "shoot, shovel, and shutup" rather than  deal with all the consequences of having an endangered species making its home on their  land.    This  is  of  particular  importance  when  considering  that  some  fines  have  been  increased  with  the  passing  of  the  new  ESA,  2007.    For  instance,  if  a  species  is  harmed  within its buffer nesting area and critical habitat, the penalty is a daily fine of $250,000,  or $1,000,000 for a corporation, or time spent  in  jail (ESA, 2007, 40(1)).  This  fine  has  been increased from the previous $50 000 per day (MNR, 2010).  Increases in such fines  may  ultimately  result  in  the  undermining  of  voluntary  stewardship  and  continue  to  facilitate the  "shoot,  shovel,  and  shutup"  culture  that  was  already  prevalent  in  farming  communities and among many other types of private landowners prior to the passing of  the  ESA,  2007.    Ridding  the  property  of  the  species  altogether  reduces  the  effort  and  financial impact that an endangered species would incur to a private landowner.  The  existence  of  adequate  habitat  stewardship  initiatives  and  incentives  provide  measures  with  which  to  cooperate  with  private  landowners  to  ensure  more  effective  protection.  In November 2008, it was publicly announced that the MNR was allocating  $800,000 on a yearly basis to partake in the costs of existing programs in order to reduce

81 

some of the financial burden to private landowners.  An example of an existing program  that is subsidized by the MNR is the Species at Risk Farm Incentive Program (SARFIP),  where  up  to  $20,000  is  granted  per  farm,  for  all  eligible  projects.    For  all  other  private  landowners,  the  Conservation  Land  Tax  Incentive  Program  (CLTIP)  encourages  and  grants  support  for  longterm  stewardship  of  various  categories  of  conservation  land  by  granting  property  owners  tax  relief  in  exchange  for  the  protection  of  natural  heritage  features  on  their  property.    However,  landowners  and  farmers  are  only  allowed  to  participate in stewardship programs, and they are only eligible for property tax relief if an  endangered  species  is  known  to  presently  inhabit  the  land.  There  are  no  incentives  in  existence for the habitats of threatened species or other species at risk (Miller, 2009: 54).  The  implementation gaps present  in Ontario affect all  species at risk.   A second  case study on the Jefferson Salamander also attempts to highlight weaknesses in current  species  at  risk  legal  protectionist  measures  in  Ontario.    Most  weaknesses  and  implementation gaps encountered in the case of the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike also arise  in the subsequent case. 

5.2 The Jefferson Salamander  5.2.1 Shining the Spotlight on the Jefferson Salamander  The  case  of  the  Jefferson  Salamander  (Ambystoma  jeffersonianum)  serves  as  a  key  illustration  of  the  importance  of  indicator  species.    Understanding  the  ecology  of  a  species  is  a  crucial  component  of  establishing  policies  for  protection.    Since  it  is  an  amphibian,  the  salamander  is  extremely  vulnerable  to  negative  environmental  change.  The salamander's  life  cycle consists of both an aquatic and terrestrial  stage  hence,  it  is  often  exposed  to  a  wider  variety  of  pollutants  throughout  its  entire  life  history  in  comparison to other organisms that live out their life cycles in one main type of habitat.  Its moist, permeable skin adsorbs chemicals from the surrounding environment.  The  Jefferson  Salamander  is  a  very  important  indicator  species  for  Ontario's  Greenbelt,  a  protected  area  of  green  space  found  within  densely  populated  and  highly  urbanized areas of southern Ontario.  As there is much scientific uncertainty in the face of  massive urbanization, the species also provides a telling illustration of the challenges of  species protection in the context of significant scientific uncertainty.  The salamander, as

82 

elaborated below, is hard to identify, and its members live secretive lives, making habitat  protection difficult.  Initiatives taken to protect the species can very likely be extrapolated  to other less sensitive species at risk that reside within the area. 

5.2.2 Ecological Traits and Habitat Requirements 
25  The Jefferson Salamander  (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) is a fairly large grey to 

brownishgrey  salamander.    The  amphibian  reproduces  by  amalgamating  its  eggs  into  gelatinous  masses,  that  are  subsequently  attached  to  sticks  and  plant  stems.    Each  egg  mass typically contains 16 to 40 eggs.  The eggs contain a dark brown or black pigment,  and  they  are  protected  by  a  layer  of  gel.    These  elements,  along  with  the  presence  of  dissolved organic matter in the breeding pond, serve to protect developing embryos from  damage  due  to  exposure  to  ultraviolet  Â­B  radiation  (Licht,  2003:  551  Jefferson  Salamander  Recovery  Team,  2010:  1).    Highly  dependent  on  water  temperature,  eggs  complete  their  development  in  two  to  four  weeks.    In  July  and  August,  juvenile  salamanders  begin  to  move  out  of  the  breeding  pond  and  search  for  shelter  amid  the  forest litter (Jefferson Salamander Recovery Team, 2010: 1).  The  Jefferson  Salamander  is  a  unique  species  that  exhibits  unusual  reproductive  biology  and  genetics.    It  is  widely  known  to  coexist  with  the  Bluespotted  Salamander  (Ambystoma laterale).  These polyploid individuals tend to be A. laterale females, which  are  unable  to  reproduce  successfully  without  the  contribution  of  male  gametes  from A.  jeffersonianum.    Since  these  polyploid  populations  cannot  exist  alone,  they  cannot  be  defined  as  a  separate  species.    Most  of  the  polyploids  are  triploid,  having  three  sets  of  chromosomes,  with  a  predominance  of  A.  jeffersonianum  chromosomes.    These  Jeffersonianumdominated  individuals  are  referred  to  as  members  of  the  A.  laterale  jeffersonianum  complex.    Since  these  individuals  cannot  be  distinguished  from  pure  A.  jeffersonianum individuals by habitat or by morphology, often genetic analysis is the only  method  of  determination.    This  makes  the  delineation  of  the  A.  jeffersonianum  species  range a rather difficult task.  Essentially, this also presents challenges for the protection 
25 

Information on the Jefferson Salamander is available under the SARAs public registry:  Species at Risk  Act (SARA), Registry. June 2008. Jefferson Salamander. <  http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=642 >.

83 

and recovery of the species.  Individuals of the A. lateralejeffersonianum complex occur  at  greater  abundance,  typically  encompassing  a  staggering  9095%  of  local  Ontario  populations (Lowcock et al., 1987 Lowcock et al., 1991 NoÃ«l et al., 2008).  Thus,  from  a  policy  perspective,  the  elements  of  the  existing  recovery  strategy  should apply to both types of  individuals (Jefferson Salamander Recovery Team, 2010:  23).  Figure 5.3 illustrates documented occurrences of the Jefferson Salamander, which  makes  up  the  Canadian  range  of  the  species.    The  Ontario  population  inhabits  the  northern  limit  of  the  species'  North  American  range  (Jefferson  Salmander  Recovery  Team, 2010: 56).  The  Jefferson  Salamander  has  very  specific  breeding  and  habitat  requirements.  Its survival is dependent on the limited availability of ideal habitat, such as the presence  of  fishless  vernal  pools  and  wetlands,  within  or  in  close  proximity  to  woodland,  so  the  species  can  successfully  breed  and  burrow.    Thus,  in  addition  to  being  an  indicator  species  of  the  health  of  the  local  woodland  environment  and  high  quality  vernal  pools,  the Jefferson Salamander plays a crucial role in channeling nutrients between the aquatic  environment and the upland wooded environment, due to it carrying out its life history in  both aquatic and terrestrial environments (Jefferson Salmander Recovery Team, 2010: 3).  Since  it  is  an  amphibian,  the  Jefferson  Salamander  is  dependant  upon  water  for  breeding  and  survival.    Breeding  takes  place  during  the  first  spring  rains  in  March  and  April,  usually  in  temporary  vernal  pools  and  wetlands.    Breeding  ponds  are  typically  vernal pools that are sourced by groundwater, snowmelt, or surface waters.  These vernal  pools will tend to disappear and desiccate  in  mid to late summer.  Some other types of  breeding  areas  may  include  wetlands  that  may  also  have  permanent  or  semipermanent  water  stands.    Breeding  ponds  tend  to  be  located  within  a  woodland,  or  in  very  close  proximity to a woodland.  The Jefferson Salamander has a tendency to return to the same  breeding pond in subsequent years.  A key factor for breeding success is the availability  of  low  shrubs,  twigs,  fallen  tree  branches,  or  other  forms  of  vegetation,  which  are  required for the attachment of egg masses (Jefferson Salamander Recovery Team, 2010:  9).  Food items must be readily available.  These are typically small aquatic invertebrates  and amphibian larvae.  Essential to the breeding success of the species is the absence of  fish predators within breeding ponds (ibid.).

[Jefferson Salmander Recovery Team, 2010: 7] 

Adding  to  the  specificity  of  the  species'  breeding  grounds  and  habitat,  the  Jefferson  Salamander  also  makes  use  of  moist  soils  that  are  prevalent  in  deciduous  or  mixed  woodlands.    This  terrestrial  habitat  is  absolutely  essential  for  the  survival  of  the  species as it is used during all portions of its life cycle:  migration to and from breeding  grounds, summer and fall movement and foraging, and overwintering.  The habitat must  contain moist microhabitat, such as leaf litter, fallen branches, tree stumps, rock fissures,
85 

and rodent burrows.  It is  in this  locale that the Jefferson Salamander resides when  it  is  not migrating or breeding.  Migratory movements can range from distances of 300 m up  to 1 km from the breeding pond to surrounding habitat.  The species is fairly mobile for  its size (Jefferson Salamander Recovery Team, 2010: 10). 

5.2.3 Current Status and Causes of Decline  The  distribution  of  the  Jefferson  Salamander  is  not  entirely  known.    The  most  recent  data  suggest  that  it  exists  within  a  total  of  13  localities  in  three  main  areas  of  southern  Ontario.    As  of  October  2008,  distribution  of  the  species  is  restricted  to  328  breeding  ponds,  representing  27  populations  (Jefferson  Salamander  Recovery  Team,  2010: 6).  However, population size is unknown.  Such population estimates are difficult  to obtain due to the secretive nature of the species and the presence of triploid females of  the A. lateralejeffersonianum complex that carry three copies of each chromosome:  two  copies  from  the  Jefferson  Salamander  species  and  one  copy  from  the  Bluespotted  Salamander species.  Furthermore,  it  is  very  likely  that  the  species  is  in  a  state  of  continual  decline,  especially considering its limited habitat located within the Greater Toronto Area and the  surrounding  Greenbelt,  the  most  densely  populated  area  of  Ontario.    COSEWIC  and  COSSARO have both designated the species as being "threatened".  Historically, prior to  the  clearing  of  forests  for  agriculture,  the  Jefferson  Salamander  was  most  likely  more  widespread  throughout  southwestern  and  southcentral  Ontario  (Jefferson  Salamander  Recovery Team, 2010: 6).  Habitat  loss  is considered to be the greatest threat to the species.  The  Jefferson  Salamander  inhabits  deciduous  forests  that  contain  nonpermanent  ephemeral  bodies  of  water, which it uses for breeding.  Examples include limestone sinkhole ponds and kettle  ponds fed by spring runoff, groundwater, or natural springs.  Presently, suitable habitat is  available  only  on  fragmented  deciduous  woodlots  of  agricultural  land  (SARA  Public  Registry,  2010).    Anthropogenic  activities  linked  to  urbanization,  aggregate  extraction,  and resource development, are the greatest threat to the species in southern Ontario.  The  development  of  roads,  linked  to  urbanization,  can  establish  barriers  to  dispersal  and  migration, and result  in  habitat fragmentation.  Individuals  have  been killed  by  vehicles

86 

while attempting to migrate across roads, and curbs and catch basins may pose as barriers  and  traps.    Climate  change  and  anthropogenic  development  is  linked  to  the  drying  and  filling of  vernal pools, and  may also contribute to the  modification of the timing of the  breeding  season.  Habitat  destruction  also  takes  a  toll  on  the  breeding  success  of  the  species.  Particularly, considering the pond fidelity of the species, if breeding ponds are  destroyed  from  year  to  year,  once  they  migrate  to  their  previously  existing  breeding  grounds, breeding individuals will not have the ability to successfully reproduce.  It will  prove  laborious  to  find  new  breeding  grounds,  or  they  may  be  nonexistent  (Jefferson  Salamander Recovery Team, 2010: 1112). 

5.2.4 Existing Legal Measures for the Protection of the Jefferson Salamander  The  Jefferson  Salamander  is  protected  at  the  federal  level  under  the  federal  Species at Risk Act.  It is also  protected at the provincial  level  by the Ontario  Fish and  Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997 which prohibits the killing, harassment, or capture of the  species.  The species also receives protection under the Ontario Endangered Species Act,  2007  (SARA  Public  Registry,  2010).    As  required  under  c.  6,  s.  9  of  the  Ontario  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007,  a  recovery  strategy  has  recently  been  compiled  which  explicitly outlines strategies for the protection and recovery of the species.  A  regulation  to  protect  the  habitat  of  the  Jefferson  Salamander  under  the  Endangered Species Act, 2007 came into force on February 18, 2010.  The salamander is  one of nine species that is the subject of a specific habitat regulation as outlined under c.  6, s. 56 of the ESA, 2007. A  "habitat regulation  is a  legal  instrument that prescribes an  area that will be protected as the habitat of the species" (Jefferson Salamander Recovery  Team, 2010: 21).  Since the species is typically found along the Niagara Escarpment, the  habitat  regulation  is  limited  to  the  City  of  Hamilton,  the  counties  of  Brant,  Dufferin,  Elgin,  Grey,  Haldimand,  Norfolk  and  Wellington  and  the  regional  municipalities  of  Halton, Niagara, Peel, Waterloo and York.  The  regulated  habitat  for  the  Jefferson  Salamander  protects  wetlands,  pools  and  ponds that are being used by individuals or that were used in the past 5 years.  The area  within 300 m of these wetlands is also protected as habitat.  In addition, suitable breeding  areas  to  which  Jefferson  Salamanders  may  disperse,  up  to  1  km  away  from  protected

87 

breeding  ponds,  are  protected  (MNR,  2010b).    These  limits  have  been  set  in  place  because  it  has  been  discovered  that  the  species  is  very  mobile  for  its  size,  as  it  can  migrate  from  300  m  up  to  1  km  from  breeding  ponds  to  habitat  (Jefferson  Salamander  Recovery Team, 2010: 10).  5.2.5 Implementation Gaps  Implementation gaps exist for data and for action, particularly when compared to  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike.    There  has  previously  been  little  information  available  with  regards  to  recovery  efforts  and  there  is  currently  no  breeding  program  for  the  Jefferson Salamander.  Only recently, with the advent of the Ontario Endangered Species  Act, 2007 has a recovery strategy  been set  in place.  Perhaps this could  be attributed to  the more recent media attention given to the plight of the species.  The public perception of species at risk is greatly influenced by the availability of  information that is mainstream and accessible.  In recent years, the Jefferson Salamander  has  been  featured  in  a  number  of  media  stories  and  newspaper  articles  (for  instance,  Kyonka, 2008), giving the species a significantly higher level of media exposure than the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike.    Both  species  are  ecologically  important,  and  each  play  different roles in the ecosystem.  As  noted  above,  the  Jefferson  Salamander  is  particularly  important  for  the  identification  of  adversely  impacted  ecosystems.    It  would  be  wise  to  protect  these  organisms,  because  they  are  as  helpful  as  they  are  important  within  the  food  web.    Dr.  Jim Bogart, chair of the Jefferson Salamander Recovery Team stresses the importance of  protecting  the  species,  and  notes  that  "the  goal  is  to  know  exactly  where  these  salamanders  are  living  [...]  then  we  can  justify  legislation  to  protect  these  areas"  (Edmonson,  2003).    In  accordance  with  a  habitat  regulation  under  the  ESA,  2007  specifically  outlined  for  the  Jefferson  Salamander,  a  strong  recovery  strategy  has  been  composed for the species, having recently been completed in March of this year.  ENGOs  such as the Save Ontario Species Coalition (S.O.S) are applauding the strategy as setting  a  precedent  by  following  sciencebased  ecological  recommendations  based  on  the  species'  life  history  traits  to  enable  the  protection  of  breeding,  migrating,  and  overwintering grounds (Richmond Hill Naturalists, 2009).

88 

Indeed,  the  greatest obstacle  for  the  protection  of  the  salamander  is  the  species'  own  characteristic  traits  and  preference  for  obscurity.    Although  the  ecology  of  the  species  is  very  well  known  in  comparison  to  other  species  at  risk  in  Ontario  due  to  extensive study based on its unique genetic traits, widespread habitat protection is crucial  to its protection.  Since the species  is obscure and populations are difficult to delineate,  the selection of appropriate habitat slated for protection in accordance with the recovery  strategy  is  extremely  important,  as  well  as  the  impetus  for  applying  a  precautionary  approach to habitat protection.  Obstacles to the implementation of the habitat regulation  also arise  in the physical  limitations that  impede  adequate  monitoring and enforcement.  It may also prove to be a trying task in terms of the allocation of funds and personnel to  specifically  enforce  the  implementation  of  the  habitat  regulation  that  was  recently  brought into force.  For instance, habitat regulations do not restrict all land uses.  Instead,  the regulation is in place to identify the areas where the MNR has jurisdiction to regulate  any  harmful  activities.    Any  activities  deemed  not  to  harm  habitat  are  allowed  to  continue,  while  those  deemed  to  harm  habitat  are  only  allowed  to  proceed  by  permit  (Richmond Hill Naturalists, 2009).  However, all such activities are difficult to monitor  as it is impossible for personnel to be present at all locales for a continued period of time,  particularly during an economic recession, where governments usually opt to cut funding  and personnel.  In  addition,  the  S.O.S.  coalition  continues  to  voice  its  concern  for  the  species.  There is a hope that the regulation will allow the Jefferson Salamander to survive amidst  constant  development  pressures  within  its  habitat,  and  a  great  stress  is  placed  on  the  importance of applying as precautionary an approach as possible.  Nonetheless, it is too  early to determine the impacts of the regulation (Richmond Hill Naturalists, 2009).  Other  gaps  in  implementation  may  arise  since  most  research  on  the  Jefferson  Salamander  has  primarily  focused  on  the  biology  and  genetics  of  the  species,  and  research that is specifically focused on natural and anthropogenic threats to the species is  very  scarce.    Hence,  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  and  evaluate  all  elements  that  are  responsible for the decline of the species.  Lack of information on all possible threats to  the  species  will  pose  barriers  in  mitigation  of  species  declines  (Jefferson  Salamander  Recovery Team, 2010: 13).

89 

The case of the Jefferson Salamander brings to light the potential benefits of legal  protection that is based on sound scientific knowledge and on ecological importance and  sensitivity.    Furthermore,  it  illustrates  the  importance  of  obtaining  this  knowledge  for  obscure  species,  by  performing  scientific  research  so  as  to  better  understand  their  preference for certain habitats as well as comprehending life history strategies.  Lack of  scientific  knowledge  and  foresight  could  lead  to  difficulties  in  protecting  obscure  and  understudied species.  Ecology of species must be well understood in order to create and  subsequently implement recovery strategies.  With  specific  reference  to  the  Jefferson  Salamander  recovery  strategy,  although  recovery  objectives  and  goals  are  explicitly  outlined  and  prioritized  by  level  of  importance and urgency, an outline of the time required to implement the objectives and  fulfill the goals is lacking (Jefferson Salamander Recovery Team, 2010: 1820).  Hence, a  significant barrier to implementation is the lack of specific timelines for the recovery of  the species. 

Dedicated legislation and policy tools within multiple jurisdictions are in place to  protect  Ontario  species  at  both  the  federal  and  provincial  levels.    Yet,  both  Jefferson  Salamander  and  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  populations  remain  in  dire  shape.    It  is  important  to  consider  the  plight  of  species  at  risk  in  a  province  which  does  not  have  designated  endangered  species  legislation,  such  as  British  Columbia.    The  legal  and  policy tools available for species at risk in BC will now be examined, with two BC case  studies to follow.

CHAPTER 6.0 PROVINCIAL  LEGAL MEASURES FOR SPECIES  AT RISK IN  BRITISH COLUMBIA  Most wildlife species and species at risk reside on provincial land.  Therefore the  provinces  wield  the  largest  responsibility  for  the  protection  of  species  at  risk.    Ninety  percent  of  the  province  of  British  Columbia  falls  under  provincial  jurisdiction  (Greenbaum and Wellington, 2010: 480).  Thus, the biodiversity crisis is best addressed  at the provincial level.  With this knowledge, all available legal tools for the protection of  species at risk in the province of British Columbia at the provincial level of government  are evaluated in this chapter.  This has been done in the previous chapter for the province  of Ontario, and the efficacy of available tools in both provinces is compared in Chapter 8,  in addition to recommendations for future reforms.  British  Columbia  is  one  of  the  most  diverse  provinces  in  all  of  Canada,  both  geographically  and  biologically.  The  BC  Ministry  of  Environment's  website 

substantiates the province's crucial contributions to Canada's overall biodiversity: B.C. is  home to more than 1138 species of vertebrates, including 488 bird species, 142 mammal  species,  18  reptile  species,  22  amphibian  species,  83  freshwater  fish  species  and  368 
26  saltwater fish species.  The highest number of native species in all of Canada resides in 

British Columbia.  Three quarters of Canada's birds and mammals inhabit the province,  with  24  species  endemic  to  the  province.    The  province  houses  76  percent  of  the  country's  bird species, 70 percent of  its  freshwater fish, and 60 percent of  its evergreen  trees (Pojar, 2010: 9).  Alongside Ontario, British Columbia has the highest number of at  risk species in the nation, with 43% of its species at risk of disappearing, 86% of which  are in danger due to habitat loss and degradation (Austin et al., 2008).  The BC government states that 152 wildlife species and subspecies are considered  candidates for endangered, threatened, or vulnerable status.  Scientists have indicated that  over  1300  species  and  their  habitats  are  at  risk  in  the  province  (Western  Canada  Wilderness Committee, 2008).  It is remarkable that of these numbers, only three species  are  legally designated by the provincial government as endangered  in BC these are the  Burrowing  Owl  (Speotyto  cunicularia),  the  American  White  Pelican  (Pelecanus

erythrorhynchos) and the Vancouver Island Marmot (Marmota vancouverensis).  The Sea  Otter  (Enhydra  lutris)  has  been  designated  a  threatened  species  and  there  are  other 
27  species under consideration for future listing. 

While  urban  and  agricultural  development  is  a  key  cause  of  species  declines,  much of the biodiversity loss in British Columbia is due to industrial logging.  Almost all  logging  in  Canada  is  done  in  oldgrowth  forests  by  governmentsanctioned  clearcut  logging.    Under  the  BC  Timber  Sales  Program  (formerly  known  as  the  BC  Small  Business Program), which was established in 2002 to strengthen the provincial economy,  planners are employed to select cutblocks, or areas where logging will take place.  All at  the  expense  of  the  government,  road  builders  construct  logging  routes  and  the  rights  to  log  the  areas  are  auctioned  off  to  the  highest  bidder.    The  contractor  logs  the  trees,  specifically  using  the  clearcut  method  where  entire  expanses  of  forest  are  obliterated.  Once the trees are logged, they are transported to a mill.  The lumber is often sold under  another  company's  logo.    Many  consumers  are  uninformed  about the  BC  Timber  Sales  Program and how it functions.  In this manner, and via provincial government sanction,  every day in British Columbia, pristine old growth coastal temperate rainforests, among  the worlds' rarest ecotypes, are being logged (WCWC, 2005).  In BC, of  species that rely on  forests  for survival, 31% of  freshwater fish are at  risk, as are 25% of amphibians, 5% of mammals, and 8% of birds.  Just over one quarter  (27%) of BC's endangered species rely on the province's forests for existence (Canadian  Council of Forest Ministers, 2005).  There are only two provincial statutes that govern wildlife and  logging practices  in  British  Columbia:    the  Wildlife  Act,  1996  and  the  Forest  Practices  Code  of  British  Columbia Act, 1996.  Neither of these was designed to specifically address species at risk  or the  loss  of  biodiversity.    They  do  not  include  endangered  species  as  a  central  focus.  These  statutes  only  contain  brief  provisions  that  mention  endangered  and  threatened  species.  As such, British Columbia is one of several provinces that have no standalone  provincial endangered species legislation.

The Wildlife Act, 1996 contains provisions that are solely discretionary based on a  decision by the Lieutenant Governor in Council (i.e. Cabinet) (see Table 6.1 for details).  However,  the  Forest  Practices  Code  of  British  Columbia  Act,  1996  has  been  mostly  repealed.  In essence, the statute has been supplanted by the Forest and Range Practices  Act, 2002.  This  more recent Act contains  a regulation that was enacted specifically  for  the  purposes  of  addressing  species  at  risk.    The  Government  Actions  Regulation,  also  known  as  the  British  Columbia  Regulation  17/04,  which  was  enacted  under  the  Forest  and  Range  Practices  Act,  2002,  contains  discretionary  clauses  under  Section  13  that  essentially  leave  the  listing  and  designation  of  COSEWIC  listed  species  at  risk  to  the  same  minister  that  is  responsible  for the  Wildlife Act,  1996.   Protectionist  measures  are  not  clearly  outlined  or  defined.    Once  the  Minister  decides  to  assign  protection  to  COSEWIC  listed  species,  discretionary  protection  by  way  of  a  management  planning  process would ensue.  However, there are no mandatory recovery plans or critical habitat  protection under the regulation.  There  is  also  a  category  of  species  at  risk  in  British  Columbia  that  has  been  established by order under section 11(1) of the Government Actions Regulation (BC Reg.  17/04) of the  Forest and Range  Practices Act, 2002.  According to the BC Ministry of  Environment website, "this category of species at risk represents those species that may  be  affected  by  forest  or  range  management  on  Crown  land  and  are  listed  by  the 
28  Committee on the Status of Endangered  Wildlife  in Canada (COSEWIC)."  There are  29  presently 85 species at risk  by order under this category.  These  listed species are the 

core  of  the  Identified  Wildlife  Management  Strategy  (IWMS),  as  directed  under  provisions of the Forest and Range Practices Act, 2002.  According to the BC Ministry  of  Environment  website,  "the  IWMS  provides  direction,  policy,  procedures  and  guidelines  for  managing Identified  Wildlife.  The goals of the Strategy are to minimize  the effects of forest and range practices on Identified Wildlife situated on Crown land and  to maintain their limiting habitats throughout their current ranges and, where appropriate,

30  their historic ranges"  .  However, the goals only include management initiatives, and do 

not include recovery strategies, nor do they  mandate habitat protection.  The goals only  discuss the maintenance of their `limiting habitats'.  In correspondence with federal government actions, the only instance of recovery  planning  in  BC  occurs  in  accordance  with  the  CanadaBritish  Columbia  Agreement  on 
31  Species  at  Risk  ,  under  the  Accord  for  the  Protection  of  Species  at  Risk  in  Canada. 

Although  it  is  mentioned,  recovery  planning  is  by  no  means  a  mandatory  action,  as  explicitly  illustrated  under  Section  2.10  of  the  accord.    This  section  states  that  "cooperative,  voluntary  measures  are  the  first  approach  to  securing  the  protection  and  recovery  of  species  at  risk".    Voluntary  measures  are  never  intended  to  be  mandatory.  The importance of valid factual information is also stressed in Section 8.1 of the  accord, where it is stated that "the parties will provide their best available information to  [COSEWIC]."  Nonetheless, the validity of the information is left to discretion, as there  is  no  mention of  a  method  of  substantiating  the  information.    With  respect  to  recovery  planning, implementation of recovery plans is not explicitly mandated.  This is noted in  Section  11.1  of  the  accord,  where  the  preparation  of  a  two  step  recovery  process  is  discussed  very  briefly.    The  two  step  process  includes  the  creation  of  a  technically  and  biologically feasible recovery strategy and that of an action plan which outlines the socio  economic costs of recovery and implementation.  A specific mandate and instructions for  implementation  of  these  policy  tools  is  not  mentioned.    Hence,  as  discussed  in  the  entirety of Section 11.0, a recovery process for listed species at risk in British Columbia  is minimal, vague, and highly discretionary.  In  essence,  British  Columbia  is  taking  the  opposite  approach  to  Ontario,  a  province that has standalone species at risk legislation.  BC has opted to address species  at  risk  issues  within  statutes  that  are  not  specifically  dedicated  to  the  issue,  or  within  vague regulations that have been established specifically to attempt to address the issue.  However, the entire process is completely discretionary.

British  Columbia  is  in  urgent  need  of  legislation  that  is  tailored  to  the  requirements of species at risk.  In order to better address the problem of biodiversity loss  within the province, species that reside on provincial Crown lands and private lands must  be protected by legislation within the provincial jurisdiction, as the federal Act does not  apply within these areas.  As a result, "nonfederal" species at risk of extinction are not  granted any specific protection tailored to address their conservation.  The  province  is  required  to  prepare  recovery  strategies  in  order  to  fulfill  its  commitments to recover species at risk under the Accord for the Protection of Species at  Risk in Canada, and the CanadaBritish Columbia Agreement on Species at Risk.  Both  the accord and agreement emphasize the importance of interjurisdictional collaboration,  among the provincial jurisdictions and at the federal and provincial levels.  Despite its commitment to the accord and the agreement, the province of British  Columbia  has  not  created  dedicated  endangered  species  legislation  to  date.    It  has  the  advantage  of  having  many  lessons  to  draw  from  various  examples  of  provincial  endangered  species  statutes  that  have  already  been  in  existence  for  a  number  of  years.  The  most  notable example  is the  newly revised  Ontario  Endangered Species Act, 2007,  which was discussed in Chapter 4.  In fact, a coalition of environmental groups in British  Columbia  comprised  of  the  David  Suzuki  Foundation,  EcoJustice,  ForestEthics,  Sierra  Club BC and Western Canada Wilderness Committee have started a campaign entitled "The  Last Place on Earth Without an Endangered Species Law".  The title is intended as a play on  words  for the  BC government's tourism advertisement campaign  entitled  "The Best Place 
32  on Earth". 

The Liberal Party was returned to power in the spring of 2009, under the leadership  of Gordon Campbell.  The BC government throne  speech  in  August 2009  inaugurated the  formation  of  a  Species  at  Risk  Task  Force  (Ecojustice,  2009b).    ENGOs  are  pushing  the  direction of the Task Force to follow in the footsteps of the Ontario model for endangered  species  legislation  one  which  includes  an  expert  panel,  sciencebased  listing,  and  mandatory habitat protection to enable species recovery and survival (ibid.).

The province of Ontario was selected for comparison in this study so as to outline  the benefits of specific species at risk protection under two jurisdictions, at the provincial  and federal levels, in contrast to dedicated species at risk protection solely at the federal  level, as is the case in British Columbia to date.  Although it does contain many aspects  that  will  require  some  improvement,  the  Ontario  ESA,  2007  currently  maintains  its  reputation as the strongest provincial endangered species legislation in the country.  The  two  case  studies  of  endangered  species  in  British  Columbia  that  follow  in  Chapter 7 are intended to accumulate evidence of the  inadequacies of the existing  legal  measures of species at risk in the province, as well as at the level of federal jurisdiction.  The  importance  of  the  validity  and  timeliness  of  scientific,  biological,  and  ecological  information  for  the  development  of  protectionist  policies  is  also  highlighted.  Recommendations for further reforms are found in Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 7.0 BRITISH COLUMBIA SPECIES AT RISK: TWO CASE STUDIES  The  case  study  approach  is  intended  to  highlight  inadequacies  in  the  existing  provincial  and  federal  legal  measures  for  the  protection  of  species  at  risk,  and  shine  a  light on possible areas of improvement to aid in the revision of existing policies and the  creation of  new ones.  Thus  far, the  focus  has  been on  species at risk policy  in Ontario  and  the  highlighting  of  inadequacies  and  implementation  gaps  in  the  existing  legal  measures via two different case studies.  Ontario is a province that reaps the benefits of  the  existence  of  combined  dedicated  species  at  risk  legislation  at  both  provincial  and  federal levels.  As discussed in Chapter 6, it is evident that British Columbia, on the other  hand,  lacks  dedicated  species  at  risk  legislation  and  relies  on  other  legal  measures  alongside  existing  federal  legislation  to  address  species  at  risk  issues.    Two  British  Columbia case studies are evaluated to analyze the effects of existing legal tools on two  different  species  at  risk:    the  Northern  Spotted  Owl  and  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot.  Both  species  are  listed  as  endangered  on  the  SARA  public  registry.    Like  both  Ontario  case  studies,  these  two  species  are  also  important  indicators of  ecological  health  where  their alarming decline is a signpost for environmental and ecosystem deterioration.  The  accumulation of evidence in the two cases is intended to determine if existing measures  are sufficient for protecting species at risk in BC, and to conclude with recommendations  for change and reform. 

7.1 The Northern Spotted Owl  7.1.1 Canada's Most Endangered Bird and Indicator of West Coast Forest Health  The  Northern  Spotted  Owl  (Strix  occidentalis  caurina)  is  Canada's  most  endangered bird, and British Columbia's most endangered species.  It is also an indicator  species  that  represents  the  health  of  an  extremely  important  Canadian  ecosystem:  Canada's  last  remaining  oldgrowth  forests.    These  forests  contain  a  vast  amount  of  biodiversity.    The  loss  of  the  Spotted  Owl  presents  a  warning  sign  that  the  extensive  logging  which  is  currently  taking  place  will  disrupt  natural  processes  that  millennia  of  forest growth have facilitated:  food web development prevention of soil erosion, floods,  and landslides nutrient enrichment of soil and reducing the greenhouse effect, to name  but a few.  The Spotted Owl is also an indicator and possible future predictor of the fate

99 

of  the  71  vertebrate  species  that  occupy  the  same  habitat  as  the  bird  (Stone  and  Reid,  1997: 80). 

7.1.2 Ecological Traits and Habitat Requirements 
33  The  Northern  Spotted  Owl  (Strix  occidentalis  caurina)  is  one  of  Canada's 

largest  owl  species.    It  is  endemic  to  a  very  small  pocket  of  coastal  Pacific  forest  in  British Columbia.  Like all other owl species, the Spotted Owl has adapted a capability to  hunt for prey at night.  It possesses the characteristic traits of light, fluffy plumage, which  facilitates soundless  flight sharp talons and a  hooked bill to allow  for the catching and  tearing  apart  of  prey  eyes  that  are  adapted  for  night  vision  and  very  sharp  hearing.  These  characteristics  allow  the  owl  to  hunt  unsuspectingly  during  the  night.  Approximately 95 percent of the species' diet is composed of small mammals such as the  Deer Mouse, woodrats, voles, moles, and hares.  The remainder of its diet is composed of  birds, large insects, and reptiles (BC MOE, 1998).  Studies  of  radiotagged  Northern  Spotted  Owls  have  produced  evidence  that the  owl  prefers  to  forage  in  oldgrowth  stands  of  forest.    Hence,  its  preferred  foraging  and  nesting  habitat  is  very  limited  to oldgrowth  forest  (BC  MOE,  1998).  The  owl  requires  more than 100 acres (or 40.5 hectares) of old growth low elevation coniferous forests to  breed,  forage,  and  raise  young.    It  gives  preference  to  trees  over  200  years  of  age  (ForestEthics,  2002  Payton,  2006).    The  owl  does  not  nest  above  1,200  metres,  and  roughly 70 percent of Spotted Owl habitat has already been logged. 

7.1.3 Current Status and Causes of Decline  The  logging  of  oldgrowth  forests  in  British  Columbia  is  negatively  affecting  many  species  at  risk.  Logging  is  especially  damaging  for  the  remaining  population  of  Northern  Spotted  Owls.    The  species  was  declared  to  be  endangered  by  COSEWIC  in  1986.    The  bird  has  been  documented  to  be  declining  by  810%  annually,  or  by  about  84%  over  the  last  decade  (David  Suzuki  Foundation,  2005).    This  is  an  appalling  rate,

considering that it is thought that about 150 years ago, over 1,000 spotted owls lived in  the oldgrowth forests of southwest British Columbia.  Presently,  less than twenty birds  remain.  In 2005, only  four breeding pairs  could  be tracked  in the wild.  Only  six owls  currently  exist  in  the  wild,  while  ten  are  being  held  in  captivity  for  the  purposes  of  captive breeding, in hopes of eventually contributing to a population recovery (WCWC,  2010).  Two owls are slated  for removal  into captivity,  leaving only two independently  breeding  pairs  in  the  wild  (ibid.).    The  biggest  threat  to  the  remaining  birds,  or  to  the  future  existence  of  released  captivebred  birds,  is  the  fragmentation  of  their  precious  habitat due to commercial logging, or the disappearance of their habitat altogether. 

7.1.4 Existing Legal Measures for the Protection of the Spotted Owl  The Northern Spotted Owl is only protected under the Species at Risk Act at the  federal  level.    As  the  owl  is  not  a  migratory  bird,  it  does  not  have  the  benefit  of  being  protected by the Migratory Bird Convention Act, 1994.  Although British Columbia does  not  have  any  provincial  statutes  that  dedicate  specific  protection  to  species  at  risk,  the  owl  is  somewhat  protected  under  the  Forest  Practices  Code  of  British  Columbia  Act,  1996,  Forest  and  Range  Practices  Act,  2002,  and  the  Wildlife  Act,  1996.    Of  these  statutes, the Wildlife Act, 1996  includes the  most protective  measures  for the owl.  The  Act  encompasses  provisions  that  prohibit  the  harming  of  owls  and  their  nests  (Wildlife 
34  Act,  1996  c.48  s.34).  The  other  Acts  refer  to the  overall  health  of  forests  and  do  not 

mention protection of owl species to a specific degree.  The  Northern  Spotted  Owl  was  recognized  to  be  endangered  in  Canada  by  COSEWIC  in  1986.    In  1990,  a  Canadian  Spotted  Owl  Recovery  Team  (SORT)  was  established,  which  was  comprised  of  professional  biologists  and  professional  foresters.  SORT provided the British Columbia government with a report on management options  in  December  1994.    In  1997,  the  British  Columbia  government  sought  to  attempt  to  prevent  the  extirpation  of  the  owl  by  establishing  the  Spotted  Owl  Management  Plan  (SOMP).    The  goal  of  the  Plan  was  stated  in  the  following  terms:  "to  achieve  a  reasonable level of probability that owl populations will stabilize, and possibly improve,

over the longer term without significant shortterm impacts on timber supply and forestry 
35  employment"  .  In approving the Spotted Owl Management Plan, the British Columbia 

Cabinet accepted a "60 percent probability that spotted owl populations will stabilize and 
36  possibly  improve  over  the  long  term"  .    It  is  notable  that  the  BC  government  has 

accepted quite a low level of probability of population stability.  The  SOMP  was  created  with  the  goal  of  balancing  environmental  and  socio  economic  objectives  while  encouraging  innovative  forest  management  practices.    The  SOMP  covers  21  areas  totaling  approximately  363,000  hectares  in  the  Chiliwack  and  Squamish forest districts, Northeast of Vancouver.  The complete area includes 159,000  hectares of protected areas and approximately 204,000 hectares of Crown forested land.  Areas  called  Special  Resource  Management  Zones  (SRMZs)  were  created  in  order  to  "integrate"  spotted  owl  management  and  forest  management  objectives.    Within  each  SRMZ, 67 percent was to be held as  suitable owl habitat over the longer term while 33  percent was  made available  for clearcut harvesting.  There are 18 SRMZs, each  located 
37  about 15 km apart on average  (Blackburn and Godwin, 2004: 910). 

A drawback to the SOMP is that it permits clearcut logging in one third of forests  situated  within  Spotted  Owl  critical  habitat.  However,  it  encourages  other  methods  of  harvesting that  "might"  have  less  impact on owls and their  habitat.  Nonetheless, clear  cut logging is the most widely used method of logging in this area (Payton, 2006).  In the  SOMP, the BC government claims that it attempts to "balance Spotted Owl requirements  with  social  and  economic  concerns."    The  Plan  turned  out  to  be  a  "selfdescribed  compromise  between  economics  and  conservation  which  may  or  may  not  save  the  Spotted Owl" (ibid.).  Hence, ecologists and environmentalists have criticized the SOMP  for  not  being  adequately  precautionary,  mainly  because  it  still  allows  for  too  much  logging within Spotted Owl critical habitat.

The SOMP has also been criticized by scientists as described in the report entitled 
38  Population  Assessment  of  the  Northern  Spotted  Owl  in  British  Columbia  19922001. 

The report makes use of existing science as a critique for current legal tools.  Essentially,  scientists predicted the demise of the species based on the SOMP.  The study consisted of  the monitoring of Spotted Owls within 40 survey areas located inside and outside SRMZs  between 1992 and 2001.  Actual population declines documented between 1992 and 2001  were  compared  with  expected  declines  based  on  the  implementation  of  the  SOMP.    A  simulation  model  was  used  to  predict  expected  population  numbers  resulting  from  the  implementation  of  the  SOMP,  and  based  on  SOMP  goals.    Researchers  discovered  that  the Spotted Owl population declined by 49% within the survey areas between 1992 and  2001.    This  rate  amounted  to  an  average  annual  rate  of  decline  of 7.2%.    This  rate  of  decline  is  4.8  times  faster  than  the  rate  predicted  by  the  model.    Despite  protective  measures  for  suitable  owl  habitat  in  the  survey  areas  and  SMRZs  from  1997  to  2001,  populations were declining at a significantly greater rate than that expected by following  and implementing the SOMP.  Further declines were predicted over the next few decades.  Based on the results of the study, the SOMP was deemed to be  inadequate at achieving  the  intended  goals  of  stabilizing  the  owl  population.    Scientists  urgently  recommended  that additional  management actions take place  in  order to prevent the extirpation of the  Spotted  Owl  from  the  wild.    Thus,  the  SOMP  has  been  criticized  by  scientists  and  environmentalists  for  not  being  adequately  precautionary,  and  for  allowing  too  much  logging.  The heated debate between the BC government and environmentalists has resulted  in litigation for judicial review concerning the Spotted Owl.  ENGOs sought to make use  of  this  legal  tool  to  attempt  to  mandate  the  protection  of  species  at  risk.    More  recent  examples  of  judicial  review  were  mentioned  in  Chapter  3,  in  the  cases  concerning  the  Greater SageGrouse and the Nooksack Dace.

7.1.5 The Plight of the Spotted Owl in the Courts:  Western Canada Wilderness Committee v. BC (Ministry of Forests)  The plight of the Spotted Owl has prompted litigation, but the outcome of the case  did  not  improve  the  species'  chances  of  survival.  The  context  in  which  the  case  arose  involves  complex  matters  of  environmental  management  and  also  concerns  logging  approvals. Logging can take place in BC only in accordance with a Forest Development 
39  Plan  approved  by  the  forest  District  Manager  .    The  content  of  a  Forest  Development 

Plan  (FDP)  is  stipulated  in  the  Forest  Practices  Code  of  British  Columbia  Act  and  the 
40  accompanying  regulation  entitled  the  Operational  Planning  Regulation  .    The  Forest 

Practices  Code  of  British  Columbia  Act,  section  41,  provides  that  a  District  Manager  must approve a Forest Development Plan (FDP) if it was prepared in accordance with the  laws  and  regulations  and  the  DM  is  satisfied  that  forest  resources  will  be  adequately  managed  and  conserved.  The  definition  of  "forest  resources"  found  in  the  Act  includes  wildlife, and thus includes endangered species.  Cattermole  Timber  applied  to  log  four  cutblocks  of  forest  which  had  been  classified as  "type  A old growth owl  habitat"  in the Chilliwack  Forest District, the area  within  which  the  "forest  resource"  of  the  Spotted  Owl  resides.  Logging  was  initially  approved  at  all  four  sites.  The  Western  Canada  Wilderness  Committee  applied  for  judicial  review  of  that  decision.    A  judge's  order  directed  a  different  District  Manager,  Cindy Stern, to revisit the  information and reconsider the decision to grant approval  for  the  proposed  logging.    District  Manager  Stern  decided  that  for  three  of  the  requested  cutblocks, the FDP did not adequately manage and conserve the spotted owl, whereas for  one  of  them  (Cutblock  371)  the  FDP  was  adequate.    The  one  cutblock  approved  for  logging was the smallest of the four, covering 88 hectares and calling for removal of 33  percent of the timber.  Cattermole Timber was to use new techniques of patch, strip and  selective  cutting  on  the  site.    DM  Stern  acknowledged  that the  FDP  for that  site  would  pose some risk to the owls, but in her judgment the risk was small, and moreover, it was

The Forest Act, divides the province of British Columbia into forest districts (FD), each of which has a  District Manager (DM) in accordance with the Ministry of Forests Act. The latter law has been renamed the  Ministry of Forests and Range Acts through the Forests and Range Statutes Amendment Act, 2006, s. 27.  40  Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act Operational Planning Regulation, B.C. Reg. 107/ 98,  enacted under the Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act.

outweighed  by  the  benefit  of  obtaining  comparative  information  for  monitoring  (i.e., 
41  information comparing the owls' use of selectively logged versus unlogged forests)  . 

The  WCWC applied  for  judicial review of DM Stern's decision, on the grounds  that the DM had "erred" in her interpretation of the relevant section of the law, and that  she  had  failed  to  apply  the  precautionary  principle.    The  claim  was  inherent  in  the  following  terms:  "because  of  the  scientific  uncertainty  surrounding  Cattermole's  proposed  method  of  harvesting  and  the  endangered  status  of  the  spotted  owl,  the  precautionary principle would operate to foreclose all  harvesting  in the  cutblocks under 
42  consideration"  . 

The  British  Columbia  Court  of  Appeal  found  that the  government  had  intended  there  to  be  a  considerable  amount  of  reverence  to  forestry officials  on  factual  matters,  given their specific expertise.  The key issue at stake was the application of the law to the  facts.    Given  the  phrasing  of  the  relevant  provision  of  the  Act,  to  ensure  "adequate"  management and conservation, and the factual information considered, the decision made  by  the  District  Manager  had  a  rational  basis.    The  Court  held  that  although  the  District  Manager  may  not  have  given  full  effect  to  the  precautionary  principle,  her  decision  "reflects  a  degree  of  caution  akin  to that  reflected  in  the  precautionary  principle".    The 
43  NGOs appeal to the court to have the logging approval overturned was unsuccessful  . 

The  Spotted  Owl  has  been  listed  under  SARA  since  2003.    The  BC  government  continued  to  approve  logging  inside  the  habitat  of  the  Spotted  Owl,  as  a  result  of  its  Timber  Sales  Program.    The  program  is  described  in  section  7.1.6  below.    In  2004,  a  coalition  of  five  ENGOs  including  the  Sierra  Legal  Defence  Fund  (now  known  as  Ecojustice), the Western Canada Wilderness Committee, ForestEthics, the David Suzuki  Foundation,  and  the  Sierra  Club  Canada,  submitted  a  petition  to  ask  then  Environment  Minister David Anderson to impel an emergency order under the safety net provisions of  the  federal  Species  at  Risk  Act  to  protect  the  remaining  owls.    The  request  failed  as  successive federal Environment Ministers were not responsive to invoking the safety net  provisions  of  SARA  (Page,  2007  Payton,  2006  Plotkin,  2007).    The  provincial

government  has  not  yet  reversed  its  decision  to  allow  logging  in  Spotted  Owl  critical  habitat.    In  fact,  provincial  Environment  Minister  Barry  Penner  suggested  in  2005  that  "some logging in oldgrowth forests may benefit the Spotted Owls because it opens [up] 
44  their hunting territory"  . 

In  December  of  2005,  a  federal  court  challenge  was  launched  by  the  combined  forces  of  the  Sierra  Legal  Defence  Fund  (now  known  as  Ecojustice),  representing  the  Western Canada Wilderness Committee, ForestEthics, the David Suzuki Foundation, and 
45  Environmental  Defence  (Page,  2007  Plotkin,  2007).    The  lawsuit  demanded  that  the 

federal  government  intercede  on  behalf  of  the  Spotted  Owl  in  British  Columbia.    The  lawsuit represented the first legal action of its kind under the Species at Risk Act.  The Western Canada Wilderness Committee reports that the lawsuit was avoided  because  the  BC  government  promised  "to  protect  Spotted  Owl  sites",  in  critical  habitat  areas  such  as  Fire  Mountain  (WCWC,  2008b).    In  October  2008,  Western  Canada  Wilderness  Committee  set  up  a  protest  camp  where  activists  protested  against  logging  which had been continuing on Fire Mountain, and organized a rally, demanding an end to  oldgrowth  logging  on  Vancouver  Island  and  the  Lower  Mainland  of  BC  (WCWC,  2008b).  Seven Spotted Owls were counted in 2009, and only six individuals are thought  to currently exist (David Suzuki Foundation, 2010).  The species appears to be en route to  extirpation  (ibid.).  Thus,  the  province  is  failing  to  implement  its  plan  to  protect  the  species by not adequately protecting "even limited habitat areas" (Plotkin, 2007). 

7.1.6 Implementation Gaps  As of 2002, two of the province's largest logging companies, and largest loggers  of  Spotted  Owl  habitat,  International  Forest  Products  (Interfor)  and  Canadian  Forest  Products (Canfor), have voluntarily stopped logging  in Spotted Owl  habitat.  Ironically,  the provincial government has continued to be the largest logger of Spotted Owl habitat  via  its  BC  Timber  Sales  program.    The  program  is  a  Crown  corporation  that  was  established in 2002 to bolster the provincial economy.  It plans and logs "cutblocks", and

then  auctions  the  timber  in  order  to  institute  market  prices  (Payton,  2006).    The  entity  defines itself as:  "An independent organization within the BC Ministry of Forests created  to  develop  Crown timber  for  auction  to  establish  market  price  and  capture the  value  of  the  asset  for  the  public"  (Forest  Practices  Board,  2005).    The  province  has  actually  intensified logging in Spotted Owl habitat since 2002 (Payton, 2006).  More  recently,  promising  to  better  protect  Spotted  Owl  habitat,  the  BC  government,  under  approval  from  Environment  Minister  Barry  Penner,  has  allowed  logging to continue in one of the last active Spotted Owl sites in the province.  The site is  located on Fire  Mountain  in the  Lillooet Valley of  northern  British Columbia.  It is the  best remaining recovery habitat for the Spotted Owl.  Habitat for recovery of the species  will  not  remain  if  logging  is  allowed  to  continue.    Pristine  habitat  is  being  fragmented  into sections by the day, and the owls will not forage and breed in noncontiguous areas  of oldgrowth forest.  Alongside clearcutting projects, the environment minister has also  approved  the  construction  of  hydroelectric  projects  in  the  Lillooet  Valley,  which  will  also  prove  to  be  damaging  to  the  recovery  habitat  (Western  Wilderness  Committee,  2009).  In  May  of  2007,  the  BC  government  released  plans  for  a  captive  breeding  program for the Spotted Owl.  Environmentalists disagree with the plan because they see  it  as  an  excuse  to  continue  logging  prized  timber  within  the  owl's  habitat,  while  eliminating a major obstacle:  the owl (Envirolinks, 2007).  The government has already  moved forward with its plan, which essentially signifies the extinction of the owl in the  wild.    Indeed,  some  ENGOs  have  been  blaming  the  BC  government,  alleging  that  the  Spotted  Owl  captive  breeding  program  is  presently  being  used  as  a  scapegoat  to  keep  owls as captive zoo specimens, destined to never return to the wild  again,  and to allow  timber harvesting to continue unscathed.  Only  six  owls  are  thought  to  currently  remain  in  the  wild  in  British  Columbia.  The rest were captured for the captive breeding program that was established by the BC  government  in  2007  (Western  Wilderness  Committee,  2007  Nature  Canada,  2009  Western Wilderness Committee, 2009 David Suzuki Foundation, 2010 WCWC, 2010).

107 

The  captive  breeding  program  continues  to  be  highly  contentious.   The  BC  Minister  of  the  Environment  is  refusing  to  halt  clearcut  logging  practices  in  critical  Spotted  Owl  habitat  that  would  be  imperative  for  the  existence  and  recovery  of  Spotted  Owl  populations, including those individuals that would eventually be slated for release from  captivity.  Implementation  gaps  and  legal  inadequacies  also  occur  at  the  federal  level,  as  evident  in  the  case  of  the  Spotted  Owl.    Recall  that  the  SARA  applies  only  to  federal  lands, which only  include post offices, national parks, airports and RCMP detachments.  Most public (Crown) lands in Canada are under provincial jurisdiction.  This means that  only a tiny fraction of Canada is under the SARAs direct protection (Illical and Harrison,  2007:  384).    In  the  case  of  the  Spotted  Owl,  the  remaining  few  individuals  exist  on  private land.  Hence, the species is not adequately protected under.  Correspondingly, the BC government has been discussing opting out of caring for  numerous endangered species, including the Spotted Owl, for years.  The Species at Risk  Act  does  contain  special  provisions  that  can  protect  areas  that  are  normally  under  provincial  jurisdiction,  but  these  apply  only  under  special  circumstances,  and  at  the  discretion of government officials.  In addition, since the Spotted Owl is not classified as  a migratory bird, federal jurisdiction over its protection is limited, and it does not qualify  for protection under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994.  The  Species  at  Risk  Act  contains  a  federal  "safety  net"  clause.    The  clause  contains provisions which require the federal minister to take action if a jurisdiction is not  providing adequate and effective protection.  It  is essentially  "a requirement  for federal  action  in  the  face  of  provincial  or  territorial  inaction"  (Gau  et  al.,  2007).    The  federal  minister  must  recommend  to  the  Cabinet  that  federal  prohibitions  and  protection  must  apply to a threatened or endangered species.  This is to be done if the competent minister  feels  that  a  province  or  territory  is  failing  the  task  of  protecting  listed  species  or  their  critical habitat (Gau et al., 2007).  The Spotted Owl litigation was initiated to attempt to  invoke the federal "safety net", to no avail, despite the fact that all requisites to invoke it  were in place.  The BC government was failing the severely endangered species, yet the  federal  government  failed  to  use  the  provisions  outlined  in  the  SARA  accordingly.    In

108 

2004,  when  the  request  to  enable  the  emergency  provisions  was  made,  there  were  20  Spotted Owls in the wild.  Had the WCWC won its 2005 case, the provisions could have taken Spotted Owl  protection into consideration, based on the fact that the owl severely risks extirpation as a  result of inaction (Plotkin, 2007).  Therefore, in order for the SARA to be efficient, it must  allow  the  federal  government  to  strongly  assert  jurisdiction  for  the  protection  of  any  severely endangered species, regardless of where its habitat is located.  Hence, the failure  to  invoke  the  emergency  provisions  thus  far  constitutes  a  severe  implementation  gap  within the framework of the Act.  Some implementation gaps and inadequacies of policy  tools that were highlighted in this case study also arise in the case that follows. 

7.2 The Vancouver Island Marmot  7.2.1 Canada's Most Endangered Species  The  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  (Marmota  vancouverensis)  deserves  special  attention  for  many  reasons.  In  1978,  the  species  was  the  first  ever  to  be  listed  as  endangered  by  COSEWIC.    The  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  is  one  of  the  most  studied  mammals  in  its  home  province  of  British  Columbia,  and  its  life  history  traits  are  well  understood.  The species is an indicator of the forest health on Vancouver Island.  Since  the  marmot  thrives  best  in  the  presence  of  contiguous  forest  containing  high  quality  corridors,  the  decline  of  the  species  is  an  indicator  of  fragmentation  and  lower  quality  forest parcels on the island.  The species is a charismatic mammal that has a huge public  appeal, as evidenced by its choice as a mascot for the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Winter  Games.  In addition,  it  is an  important choice  for a case study  because there  have  been  substantial amounts of resources dedicated to marmot preservation and recovery efforts. 

7.2.2. Ecological Traits and Habitat Requirements

one of 14 existing marmot species worldwide.  Like all other marmot species, its habitat  consists  of  burrows.    It  is  restricted  to  habitat  in  subalpine  meadows.    Foraging  predominantly on grasses and herbaceous flowering plants, the species hibernates during  the winter.  The  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  survives  in  small  colonies,  which  on  average  contain fewer than five adults (COSEWIC, 2000: v).  The species depends upon dispersal  from  one  colony  to  another  in  order  to  avoid  inbreeding.    The  marmot  thrives  within  many  small  colonies  so  as  to  sustain  a  healthy  existence  for  the  species.    This  phenomenon is known as the `metapopulation' theory.    Dispersal of occasional migrants  among the colonies is a very important function in the marmot's life history and enables  marmot  communities  to  remain  viable  and  healthy  (COSEWIC,  2000:  v  Vancouver  Island Marmot Recovery Foundation, 2007). 

7.2.3 Current Status and Causes of Decline  The Vancouver Island Marmot is the rarest of the 14 species of marmots that are  in existence worldwide (COSEWIC, 2000).  Steep  declines  in  population  occurred 
47  during the mid1980s and throughout the 1990s.  The species was nearly extinct in the 

wild by 2003 (Janz et al., 2000).  The decline of the Vancouver Island Marmot has occurred as a result of a number  of  factors,  including  a  decrease  of  survival  rates  and  subsequent  increase  of  high  mortality  episodes.    The  species'  most  common  predators  include  wolves,  cougars,  and  golden eagles, which  are highly abundant on Vancouver Island.  Their predation on the  marmot is partly responsible for significant losses at some marmot colonies.  On the other  hand,  no  evidence  has  been  uncovered  to  suggest  that  declining  reproduction  rates  contributed to species declines (Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Foundation, 2007).  The predominant factor that has been attributed to the decline of the marmot is the  extensive logging on Vancouver Island.  Logging practices have caused fragmentation of  habitat and as such have resulted in the creation of manmade islands.  The fragmentation  has led to the isolation of the population in concentrated pockets, subsequently increasing 
47 

The marmot experienced a pronounced temporary increase in population numbers in the 1980s and 1990s  due to the temporary availability of new manmade habitats resulting from clearcut logging and forestry  activities.  Ultimately, the population declined in the long term (Janz et al., 2000).

110 

the risk of mortality from predation and reducing survival rates.  Logging has also served  to disrupt the `metapopulation' model that sustains viable marmot populations by cutting  off access to dispersal corridors.  The landscape surrounding natural habitat patches has  been  extensively  altered  by  years  of  logging  activities  (Hebda  et  al.,  n.d.).   In the  past,  hunting  and  collecting  for  scientific  purposes  were  most  likely  important  factors  however, they are negligible factors at present (UNEP, 2002).  Marmots  are  loyal  to  colony  sites.    Studies  have  found  that  colonies  that  had  previously  been  isolated  were  unlikely  to  be  recolonized,  even  if  the  habitat  remained  suitable.  Other studies have also suggested that colonies that had been recently occupied  by marmots, yet had been abandoned for several marmot generations, had been connected  at  some  point  via  betweenmountain  dispersal  movements.    Inbreeding  may  therefore  pose  a  longterm  threat  in  isolated  colonies  (UNEP,  2002  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  Recovery  Team,  2008:  1011).    Figure  7.2  illustrates  active  and  inactive  (or  isolated)  Vancouver Island Marmot colonies.  As of 2003, fewer than 30 mature wildborn marmot individuals were present in  the wild and 74 existed in captivity, indicating that the population of marmots totaled less  than 100  individuals.  Successful reintroductions  via the captive breeding program  have  increased  the  total  number  of  individuals  in  the  "wild"  to  160,  while  240  remain  in  captivity,  for  a  total  of  400  overall  (Vancouver  Island  Marmot  Recovery  Team,  2008).  The  species  is  very  sensitive  to  stochastic  events  and  it  is  especially  vulnerable  to  predation.  Predation continues to threaten the future viability of the species in the wild.  The  species  is  also  at  risk  from  the  negative  impacts  of  climate  change  and  inbreeding  depression (ibid.).  Even with captivebred marmots continuing to shore up the numbers  of  the  species  with  their  releases,  the  pressures  arising  from  anthropogenic  habitat  disturbance remain a serious concern.

7.2.4 Existing Legal Measures for the Protection of the Vancouver Island Marmot  In  1978,  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  was  one  of  the  first  species  listed  as  endangered by COSEWIC.  The species is protected under provisions of the Wildlife Act,  1996  in British Columbia  and SARA, and  is  listed as endangered under  both Acts.  The  marmot has mass media appeal as a result of its cute and cuddly appearance as well as its  status as the most endangered species in Canada.  Sensitivity of public perception and an  elevated public profile for the species has been facilitated by dedicated ENGO campaigns 
48  that  are  committed  to  publicizing  the  plight  of  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  .    As 

mentioned  above,  the  selection  of  the  species  for  a  2010  Vancouver  Olympic  Winter

The major ENGO that is dedicated to advocating the recovery of the Vancouver Island Marmot is the  Marmot Recovery Foundation (www.marmots.org) which partners its recovery efforts with Wildlife  Preservation Canada (www.wptc.org).  The Western Wilderness Committee (wildernesscommittee.org) is  another major ENGO that has contributed to publicizing the importance of marmot recovery.

112 

Games  mascot illustrates and reinforces  its  high  public profile.  The Olympic campaign  has vastly increased worldwide public exposure of the species.  The province has taken on commitments to species at risk, through the Accord for  the Protection of Species at Risk in Canada and the CanadaBritish Columbia Agreement  on Species at Risk.  A dedicated recovery strategy for the Vancouver Island Marmot has  also been developed, which relies upon captive  breeding and reintroduction (Vancouver  Island Marmot Recovery Team, 2008:  2).  The  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  Recovery  Team  was  established  in  1988.  Recovery plans were published in 1994, 2000, and 2008.  In 1998, the nonprofit Marmot  Recovery  Foundation  was  established  in  order  to  aid  in  raising  funds  and  in  the  administration of recovery efforts (Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team, 2008: iv,  2).  As a result of the charismatic and aesthetic appeal of the species and the attention that  it  has  garnered  over  the  years,  the  recovery  effort  is  the  most  successful  of  its  kind  in  Canada, to date.  In 1999, the BC Ministry of Environment acquired 1400 hectares of parkland on  Vancouver  Island  with  the  intent  of  preserving  key  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  habitat.  However,  since  critical  habitat  for  the  species  has  not  yet  been  defined  to  date,  it  is  difficult to know whether the acquisition will prove to benefit the species in the long term  (High Beam Research, January 1999 WWWC, 2009). 

7.2.5 Implementation Gaps  As  highlighted  in  the  case  of  the  Spotted  Owl,  all  species  at  risk  in  British  Columbia  are  not  fully  protected  under  the  federal Species  at  Risk  Act  because  the  Act  only applies to lands that fall within federal jurisdiction (Illical and Harrison, 2007:  384).  Recall that there are a few minor instances where the Act can apply to other lands outside  of  federal  jurisdiction,  with  strict  limitations  on  when,  where,  and  how  it  can  apply.  These provisions are referred to as a federal `safety net'.  Since  it  is an endemic species to British Columbia, and special provisions under  the  `safety  net'  or  an  emergency  order  have  not  been  invoked  for  the  species,  the  Vancouver Island Marmot is not afforded complete protection under the Species at Risk  Act.  The reason being is that most marmot habitat exists on privately owned forest lands,

113 

which  are  owned  by  Island  Timberlands  and  TimberWest  (Vancouver  Island  Marmot  Recovery Team, 2008: 10).  A commonly recurring issue in species at risk policy is the  applicability of the SARA specifically to public land.  There is a difficult challenge to the  protection  of  habitat  where  laws  predominantly  apply  to  public  lands,  even  where  provisions exist.  Provisions to apply the laws on private lands are only on a case by case  basis.  Since only 4% of all land in Canada is federal public land, this poses a problem for  those  species  that  reside  on  privately  owned  land,  and  where  critical  habitat  exists  on  private land.  The  federal Species at Risk Act  stresses the  importance of protecting the critical  habitat of endangered species.  Recall that a species' only hope of survival lies within the  viability of  its critical  habitat, the habitat that is  necessary  for the ultimate survival  and  recovery of a species.  The current Vancouver Island Marmot recovery strategy explicitly  outlines  that  critical  habitat  has  yet  to  be  defined  and  identified,  despite  the  fact  that  marmot habitat is easily identifiable and there is more than enough scientific knowledge  to do so (Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team, 2008: 19).  It  was  discovered  that  a  lack  of  critical  habitat  identification  is  common  among  many recovery strategies launched by the BC government as required under SARA.  The  Wilderness Committee and Ecojustice discovered an internal government memo in 2008  where  the  BC  government  specifically  instructed  recovery  teams  to  avoid  mapping  critical  habitat.    The  absence  of  maps  pointing  to  critical  habitat  does  not  allow  for  its  adequate location, and in turn undermines the protection of the species at risk (WWWC,  2009).  In addition, a lack of defined critical habitat may pose a problem to the viability  and  recovery  of  new  introduced  populations,  and  undermine  the  integrity  of  reintroductions.  When  important  scientific  and  ecological  information  such  as  life  history  traits  and the characteristics and location of critical habitat that is available within the planning  and  management  process  is  not  noted  or  is  ignored,  it  is  impossible  to  implement  effective legal protection.  Hence, the scientific basis of species at risk policy is crucial to  ensuring adequate protection.  The  case  of  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  is  not  the  only  instance  where  deliberate exclusion of critical habitat information in recovery strategies has occurred in

114 

Canada.  ENGOs have applied for judicial review for other instances of failure to identify  critical habitat in recovery strategies (Valiante, 2009:  44, note 37).  Recall, as mentioned  in  Chapter  3,  the  case  of  the  Greater  SageGrouse  (Section  3.3.4.1)  and  that  of  the  Nooksack  Dace  (Section  3.3.4.2).    Even  though  information  on  critical  habitat  was  available  for  each  species  in  both  instances,  inclusion of  this  crucial  information  in  the  corresponding recovery strategies was neglected.  In both cases, the judges sided with the  ENGOs, agreeing that defining critical habitat and including it within recovery strategies  is mandatory as laid out in the Species at Risk Act.  Attempts to protect critical habitat is  also  a  precautionary  approach  to  protecting  species  at  risk.    As  such,  it  satisfies  the  requirements of the CBD and the SARA.  In fact, the inclusion of available knowledge on  critical habitat location and attributes is now mandatory as the precedent was set in 2009  resulting  from  the  case  of  the  Greater  SageGrouse.    There  is  no  excuse  to  excising  important details and scientific information that would assist in the development of better  protectionist regimes and policies.  With regards to the marmot captive breeding program, successful reintroductions  leading to a drastic increase in the marmot population as outlined in the recovery strategy  could  potentially  be  overshadowed  by  continuously  looming  current  threats.    Since  the  lands  of  Vancouver  Island  are  mostly  privately  owned,  and  the  climate  is  such  that  logging is permitted up to high altitudes of mountainous terrain, further development may  be facilitated, in the absence of land acquisitions or stewardship agreements.  Continued  logging would likely pose an incessant threat to the existence of the species.  In addition,  captivebred  individuals  could  compromise  the  genetic  integrity  of  wild  populations.  Genetic  interaction  and  viability  cannot  be  completely  foreshadowed,  nor  can  it  be  modeled  to  perfection.    Reintroduced  populations  will  be  left  to  stochastic  forces  (Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team, 2008: 7).  Taking  these  implementation  and  integrity  gaps  into  consideration,  recommendations  for  adjustments  in  the  policy  process  based  on  this  case  study  are  provided in Chapter 8.  Being  the  first  listed  endangered  species  in  Canada,  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot, in a sense, set a precedent for species a risk protection and recovery measures in  Canada.    There  are  many  lessons  to  be  drawn  from  the  species.    Due  to  the  species'

115 

heightened  appeal  as  a  charismatic  mammal,  and  it  being  the  subject  of  intensive  scientific study, the presence of implementation gaps and legal inadequacies of protection  for  such  a  well  studied  species  indicates  that  the  same  gaps  are  most  likely  found  elsewhere.  It could be assumed that a much lesser effort is being applied for protection  of more obscure, lesser known species.

116 

CHAPTER 8.0 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS  Current  legal  measures  for  the  protection  of  species  at  risk  have  been  evaluated  for the federal level of jurisdiction in Canada (Chapter 3), and for two different provincial  jurisdictions:  Ontario (Chapter 4) and British Columbia (Chapter 6).  Given the crucial  importance of biodiversity issues and the challenges posed by species at risk in Canada,  there seems to be a substantial need for more case studies, and especially ones that deal  with  the  provincial  level  of  jurisdiction.    Furthermore,  the  scientific  and  ecological  particulars  of  each  case  are  often  not  prominent.    If  they  are  mentioned,  they  are  not  elaborated.  Yet, if the policy community is to be scientifically informed to allow for the  generation  of  the  most  scientifically  grounded  policy,  these  particulars  should  be  addressed within case studies.  Thus,  four  different  case  studies  have  been  analyzed  in  this  thesis  to  further  understand the impact of the current legal tools on specific species at risk that have been  listed  under  COSEWIC  (and  COSSARO  in  Ontario).    In  doing  so,  various  implementation  gaps  have  been  identified  and  highlighted.    In  this  chapter,  recommendations  for  possible  future  changes  and  reforms  to  existing  species  at  risk  policy are provided, as determined from implementation gaps highlighted in the four case  studies.    Overall,  the  importance  of  interjurisdictional  and  intrajurisdictional  cooperation  is  stressed,  as  well  as  the  benefit  of  dedicated  species  at  risk  legislation  at  both  federal  and  provincial  levels  of  jurisdiction.    Also,  it  is  recommended  that  any  flexibility instruments, such as permits or exemptions, be used with extreme caution.  In  addition,  the  importance  of  stakeholders  such  as  private  landowners  in  the  effort  to  protect  species  at  risk  should  not  be  underestimated,  and  as  such  should  be  cultivated.  These recommendations are discussed more thoroughly in this chapter. 

8.1 Species at Risk in Ontario:  Federal and Provincial Policy Recommendations  8.1.1 InterJurisdictional and IntraJurisdictional Cooperation  The overarching theme in species at risk policy and legal measures in Canada is  the  importance  of  collaboration  among  different  jurisdictions  in  achieving  the  goals  of  species at risk protection.  In the National Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk, a

117 

great  emphasis  and  responsibility  for  recovery  and  conservation  is  placed  on  voluntary  stewardship.    This  same  emphasis  is  echoed  in  the  Species  at  Risk  Act.    However,  as  illustrated particularly in the case study of the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike, and appearing  as a common thread among all species at risk, the federal government is failing to provide  adequate funding to support stewardship initiatives.  The federal government must ensure  the existence of an adequate pool of funds to subsidize stewardship programs, since it has  taken the path away from command and control policy in favour of voluntary initiatives.  The  Habitat  Stewardship  Program  as  well  as  alternative  funding  sources  should  be  expanded,  or  at  the  least  maintained,  instead  of  being  reduced,  as  has  occurred  under  Environment Minister John Baird in 2007.  Also, access to funds by potential stewards is  imperative for the program to function appropriately (Nature Canada, 2006).  Great  caution  must  also  be  taken  to  avoid  conflict  within  jurisdictions  and  in  avoidance  of  jurisdictional  overlap  between  jurisdictions.    Better  cooperation  and  communication must take place among the jurisdictions in order to satisfy the terms that  were initially laid out in the Accord.  Cooperation is imperative for the conservation and  protection of species at risk  because they occur on  federal,  but mostly provincial  lands.  A  combination  of  federal  and  provincial/territorial  legislation,  regulations,  policies,  and  programs  are  crucial  to  protecting  species  at  risk  (Canadian  Intergovernmental  Conference Secretariat, 1999 SARA Registry, 2010).  With regards to intrajurisdictional dynamics within the province of Ontario, it is  imperative that the MNR exercise care when allowing exceptions for other statutes from  the  ESA,  2007.    When  doing  so,  the  MNR  should  ensure  that  only  branches  of  government  that  are  renowned  for  their  conservation  efforts  are  given  authorization  to  allow  the  harming  of  a  species  at  risk  or  the  destruction  of  its  habitat.    Although  no  statutes have been granted exemptions in this manner as of yet, extreme caution must be  taken if such exemptions are to take place in the future (Miller, 2009: 36).  It would also  be  important  for  the  MNR  to  consult  with  the  public  on  its  agreements  with  other  branches  of  government,  both  internally  and  externally  to the  MNR,  in  order to  clearly  explain  how  overall  species  benefit  tests  of  the  ESA,  2007  will  be  met  while  allowing  otherwise prohibited activities to take place.  It should also ensure that any records of a

118 

decision  made  by  the  Minister  or  any  other  authorized  person  be  made  available  to the  public (ibid.).  Other individual programs can be established at the level of specific jurisdictions.  For  instance,  with  regard  to the  case  of  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike,  and  the  threats  that exist to all songbirds, the predatory threat of housecats and feral cats can be kept to a  minimum by introducing regulations to keep all housecats indoors and applying programs  to reduce the feral cat population, either at the provincial or municipal level. 

8.1.2 Flexibility Instruments and Exemptions  With regards to flexibility instruments within the Act, it is recommended that the  MNR  should  apply  the  "overall  benefit"  test  outlined  in  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  2007, with the inclusion of an assessment of cumulative impacts resulting from otherwise  prohibited  activities,  when  examining  these  activities  prior  to  granting  permits  or  agreements (Miller, 2009: 35).  The overall  benefit test encompasses the opinion of the  Minister that "an overall benefit to the species will be achieved within a reasonable time  through  requirements  imposed  by  conditions  of  the  permit"  or  other  instrument  (ESA,  2007,  S.O.  2007,  c.6,  17(2)(c)).    Caution  should  still  be  taken  when  applying  the  test  because  the  final  opinion  of  the  Minister  is  discretionary.    Perhaps  it  would  be  wise  to  allow a scientific body to approve the decision, allowing it to be less discretionary.  In order for the Ontario  Endangered Species Act, 2007 to function appropriately  and fully protect all listed species and their habitats, it is imperative that all exemptions  granted  to  industries  effectively  be  reversed,  and  that  no  new  exemptions  should  be  established.  If, indeed, exemptions are to stand, only projects that were approved prior to  the  introduction  of  the  new  Act,  and  that  are  not  able  to  meet  higher  permit  standards,  should apply.  If permits are to be granted, they should be approved on a project by project basis  as opposed to the current blanket exemptions for entire industries.  This will ensure that  the ESA, 2007 is not made ineffective by too many exemptions.  In addition, all flexibility  instruments do not have mandatory expiry dates.  These instruments include agreements  and  permits  as  well  as  all  exemptions  under  O.  Reg.  242/08.    Neither  the  Act  nor  the  regulation require expiry dates, review  at specific  intervals, or predetermined timelines.

119 

Permits  are  only  susceptible  to  being  amended  or  revoked  by  the  Minister.    The  above  situation could potentially allow the permissible harming and killing of species at risk for  an indefinite amount of time without any `statutemandated review'.  The Minister is the  only individual that can make a decision.  Thus, flexibility instruments are discretionary.  It is therefore recommended that expiry dates apply to all flexibility instruments so as to  allow  the  evaluation  of  these  instruments  in  accordance  with  the  ESA,  2007  or  its  regulation (Miller, 2009: 42).  As also emphasized in the case of the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike, species such as  the  Jefferson  Salamander  and  the  Shrike  could  potentially  be  adversely  affected  by  Ontario  Regulation  242/08,  and  exemptions  for  development  and  aggregate  extractors  more  specifically,  as  business  is  permitted  to  continue  as  usual,  particularly  for  those  developers and pits and quarries that obtained a license prior to the coming into force of  the ESA, 2007.  These individuals would not be subject to the provisions of the Act, nor  to those in the habitat regulations.  In  addition,  the  exemptions  for  hydro,  pits,  and  quarries  alongside  those  for  development  and  infrastructure  do  not  require  these  industries  to  explore  all  options  to  meet  higher  standards  of  permits  and  other  instruments.    Rather,  their  activities  are  allowed  blanket exemptions, which severely  undermine the  scope and the provisions of  the ESA, 2007.  It is recommended that revisions to the  Act should take place whereby  only projects that were approved prior to the passing of the Act that are not able to meet  the higher standards of permits and other instruments are to be exempted. 

8.1.3 Private Landowner Rights and Stewardship  Since  a  vast  majority  of  species  at  risk  occur  on  private  land,  landowners  are  considerable  stakeholders  of  species  at  risk  and  potentially  play  a  crucial  role  in  stewardship.  Concerning the property rights of private landowners, a greater investment  must be incorporated into stewardship activities.  On a positive note, the MNR increased  its  operating  budget  from  a  stable  $2  million  over the  last  decade  to  $6  million  for  the  20082009  fiscal  year  (Miller,  2009:  53).    It  is  unclear  whether  the  budget  will  be  increased further in future years.  Support for stewardship initiatives is very important in  densely  populated  southern  Ontario,  where  the  majority  of  the  species  at  risk  inhabit

120 

privately  owned  land.    A  prime  example  is  the  location  of  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike  territory on private fields.  However,  it remains to be seen  if the current budget will  be  enough to satisfy the needs of private landowner stewardship and other tasks at hand.  It  is recommended that a large amount of available  funds  be allotted to private landowner  stewardship initiatives.  Nevertheless,  even  where  stewardship  programs  are  in  existence,  the  scope  of  some  programs  exhibits  some  weakness.    For  instance,  the  Species  at  Risk  Farm  Incentive  Program  (SARFIP)  is  only  available  to  farm  owners.    Even  so,  not  all  farm  owners  are  eligible.    Only  those  registered  under  the  CanadaOntario  Farm  Plan  can  qualify  (Miller,  2009:  54).    In  the  same  light,  the  Conservation  Land  Tax  Incentive  Program  (CLTIP)  only  grants  funding  to  landowners  who  own  land  that  contains  endangered  species  habitat.    For  instance,  under  the  present  plan,  Jefferson  Salamander  habitat would not be eligible  for the  incentive, as it  is  listed as a threatened species.  In  fact, only 60 properties in the entire province of Ontario are presently receiving tax relief  for  endangered  species  habitat  under  the  CLTIP  (Miller,  2009:  54).    It  is  thus  recommended that the MNR expand the CLTIP to include private property that contains  habitat for a broader spectrum of listed species at risk.  These should also be extended to  recovery lands in addition to conservation lands. 

8.1.4  Recovery  Strategies,  the  Importance  of  Current  Scientific  Information,  and  Precautionary Policy  With regard to the 42 species that were originally protected under the ESA, 1971,  it is recommended that exemptions to the ESA, 2007 not apply to these particular species.  This  is  recommended  because  any  affected  industries  have  most  likely  already  taken  species protection into account as per the ESA, 1971.  There is no need to wipe the slate  clean and allow business in such industries to turn the clock back and revert to practices  that  existed  prior  to  the  listing  of  species  under  the  ESA,  1971.    By  applying  the  ESA,  2007 exemptions to the 42 original species, a precautionary approach is not taken.  Furthermore,  the  case  of  the  Jefferson  Salamander,  and  its  recovery  strategy,  highlights another negative facet of the ESA, 2007.  Though the Jefferson Salamander is a  threatened species in Ontario with a dedicated recovery strategy, still many species at risk

121 

lack  one.    There  is  a  transition  period  of  five  years  (until  June  30,  2013)  to  develop  recovery strategies for those species listed as endangered or threatened in the schedule of  the  ESA,  2007.    It  is  possible  that  the  transition  period  is  further  undermining  the  legislation that is set in place to protect species at risk.  The time lag may prove not to be  precautionary  enough.    It  is  plausible  that  the  lag  in  time  for  the  creation  and  implementation, as well as the mobilization of resources for monitoring and enforcement  could actually place some species in danger of being pushed even closer to the brink of  extinction.  When  implementing  the  ESA,  2007  and  creating  recovery  strategies,  it  is  imperative  that  research  on  the  conservation  biology  of  species  as  risk,  as  well  as  the  elements  and  interacting  factors that  cause  the  decline  of a  species,  be  conducted.   The  case of the Jefferson Salamander  highlights the  importance of quality of  information  in  the effort to pursue the recovery of species at risk.  Scientific information is the basis of  all recovery efforts, and is an integral foundation to the development and implementation  of  species  at  risk  policy.    Obscure  species  are  at  a  disadvantage  and  the  focus  of  conservation efforts tend to shift to wellstudied species.  Hence, it is recommended that  as  much  scientific  research  as  possible  be  conducted  on  all  listed  endangered  and  threatened  species.    In  addition,  the  MNR  should  commit  to  adequate  resourcing  of  research  to  fill  in  as  many  gaps  in  scientific  knowledge  as  possible  in  order to  monitor  species  recovery  satisfactorily.    Best  available  knowledge  should  be  incorporated  into  recovery  methods  so  it  can  be  adopted  within  policy  and  inform  a  sound  yet  precautionary approach.  Acting in a precautionary manner is the most opportune way to  avoid  further  species  declines,  even  in  the  absence  of  comprehensive  scientific  information.  Also,  all  recovery  strategies  should  include  integrated timelines  to  ensure  that  a  well  organized  and  chronological  research  and  monitoring  program  can  be  established  and implemented.  Furthermore, it is recommended that recovery strategies, for all listed  species that currently lack one, be established as expeditiously as feasible.  With respect  to species at risk, time  is of the utmost importance.  The greater the  lag  in time  for the  creation  and  implementation  of  a  recovery  strategy,  the  further  at  risk  a  species  may  become.

122 

With  respect  to  habitat  regulations,  it  is  imperative  that  they  be  as  specific  and  appropriate  as  possible.    Habitat  regulations,  in  a  similar  light  to  entire  recovery  strategies,  are  only  as  good  as  the  availability  of  scientific  information.    Hence,  it  is  important  that  the  regulations  and  recovery  strategies  be  compiled  based  on  the  most  recent  and  best  available  information,  or  their  integrity  could  be  compromised.    As  illustrated in both Ontario cases, range maps and maps displaying documented locations  of the species at risk should be an integral part of a habitat regulation.  In this manner, it  would facilitate the delineation of where the actual regulation would apply. 

8.2  Species  at  Risk  in  British  Columbia:  Recommendations 

Federal  and  Provincial  Policy 

8.2.1 Importance of FederalProvincial InterJurisdictional Cooperation  The results of the Spotted Owl litigation provide evidence that the Species at Risk  Act  has  already  been  failing  this  endangered  species,  and  that  the  Act  is  most  likely  failing many others.  After evaluating legal inadequacies for the protection of species at  risk  at  the  federal  level  in  Canada,  it  is  apparent  that  there  is  still  much  room  for  improvement.    Canada  requires  a  tough,  well  defined,  federal  endangered  species  act,  which directly protects all wildlife species that are most at risk.  Critical habitat must also  be preserved, regardless of where the species resides.  Since only 4 percent of all land in  Canada  lies within  federal  jurisdiction, very  few  species are completely protected under  the SARA (Austen, 1997).  For example, in the case of the Spotted Owl, much of the old  growth forests that are currently being logged under the authority and permission of the  BC government exist within provincial jurisdiction.  For this reason, endangered species  legislation must not be limited to the federal level of government.  It has been proven, as noted in the case of the Spotted Owl, that the SARA is not  strong enough to withstand jurisdictional gridlock for preservation of a species at risk.  If  the federal government undertook much stronger protective measures, it would be posing  a  threat  to the  provincial  government  and  its  authority  over  economic  development  via  resource  exploitation.    This  is  especially  relevant  to  a  province  like  British  Columbia,  which is rich in natural resources, where the province itself is an investor in the forestry

123 

industry, via the Timber Sales Program.  The  forestry  industry  is the  largest  industry  in  the  province.    It  is  very  evident  that  conflict  runs  rampant  in  situations  such  as  these,  where  jurisdictional  issues  lie  at the  heart of  the  discord.    That  said  it  is  also  apparent  that  laws  have  no  meaning  without  proper  funding,  monitoring,  and  enforcement.    The  government must be willing to appropriately train high performing personnel.  Taxpayers  must also be willing to allot their hard earned dollars to the issues at stake.  These are all  resources  that  are  limited  within  the  constraints  of  government  and  the  economy.  Without the collaboration of all these factors, the SARA will just linger as a document full  of words with no meaning. 

8.2.2 Provincial Recommendations  It is fundamental that individual provinces establish legislation for species at risk  since  the  federal  government  has  very  little  jurisdiction  over  them  in  comparison  to  provincial  governments  (Beazley  and  Boardman,  2001:  4).    Wildlife  is  considered  a  natural  resource.    The  management  of  these  resources  has  traditionally  been  the  responsibility  of  the  provinces  in  accordance  with  the  Canadian  constitution.    The  establishment of provincial endangered species legislation is extremely important, so that  species at risk may be protected at every level of government and every jurisdiction.  Not  all provinces currently have a legislation that was enacted specifically for the purpose of  protecting  species  at  risk.    Manitoba,  New  Brunswick,  Nova  Scotia,  Ontario,  Prince  Edward Island, and Quebec have passed endangered species  legislation to date.  Hence,  proper legislation is lacking at the provincial level in British Columbia.  This is one of the  major reasons why both the province and the federal government are failing the Spotted  Owl.    Candace  Batycki,  of  ForestEthics,  reiterated  this  fact  by  stating  that,  "The  BC  government  must  pass  meaningful  endangered  species  legislation  to  remove  the  stigma  created by its shameful forest policies" (ForestEthics, 2002).  Therefore, a combination of  strong  federal  and  provincial  legislation  is  crucial  to  adequately  protect  endangered  species  in  all  jurisdictions  across  the  country,  without  allowing  them  to  fall  though  the  cracks  of  the  legal  framework.    The  laws  must  also  incorporate  and  respect  the  precautionary approach.

124 

Canada  requires  a  tough,  well  defined,  federal  endangered  species  act,  which  directly  protects  all  wildlife  species  that  are  most  at  risk.    However,  tough  provincial  legislation,  as  in  the  case  of  Ontario,  would  also  be  beneficial  for  the  protection  of  species at risk.  The presence of both jurisdictional layers of protection would prove most  optimal.   For  instance,  if  it were possible  for the province of British Columbia to enact  endangered species  legislation at the provincial  level,  it could  have greater prospects of  success than maintaining sole reliance on SARA within the provincial context.  It is clear  that  sciencebased  policy  must  also  allow  for  the  preservation  of  critical  habitat,  regardless of where it is located.  Since very few species are completely protected under  the  SARA,  interjurisdictional  cooperation  is  imperative  for  the  protection  of  critical  habitat.    For  instance,  in  the  case  of  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot,  private  land  on  Vancouver Island that is currently being logged does not fall within federal jurisdiction.  This  point  also  illustrates  the  importance  of  cooperation  between  the  government  and  private landowners.  It would be beneficial if BC followed a similar stewardship strategy  to that which exists in Ontario.  Private  landowner  rights  and  voluntary  stewardship  are  issues  that  arise  in  both  British Columbia case studies as well as both Ontario case studies.  Most species at risk  critical  habitat  exists  on  privately  owned  residential  or  commercial  property.  Landowners are fundamental stakeholders and have the potential to play a crucial role in  the protection of species at risk.  In addition to legislative protection, the collaboration of  private  landowners  via  stewardship  agreements  is  imperative  to  the  preservation  of  critical habitat.  The acquisition of land for the purposes of critical habitat conservation is  another  feasible  alternative  to  command  and  control  regulation.    However,  it  can  be  a  very costly option.  A combination of these options could potentially be effective.  As  it  stands,  the  province  of  British  Columbia  has  much  to  learn  from  other  provinces  that  have  enacted  dedicated  species  at  risk  legislation.    Ontario  provides  the  best scenario from which to extract lessons.  Even though the Ontario ESA, 2007 contains  some  flaws,  the  presence  of  multiple  jurisdiction  legislation  is  still  a  much  better  alternative to protection based solely on a federal statute.

125 

8.3 Charismatic Species, Public Exposure, and Scientific Information  Another important consideration in Canadian endangered species protection is the  heavily  skewed  focus  of  conservation  efforts  towards  aesthetically  appealing  and  well  studied  charismatic  species.    To  combat  this  issue,  more  scientific  research  must  be  conducted in order to inform the policy community about the importance of more obscure  species at risk.  Obscure species encompass an equally important role in the composition  of ecosystem biodiversity.  The  case  of  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  highlights  the  effect  of  charisma  in  garnering  support  via  ENGOs  to  raise  public  awareness  of  endangered  species.    The  increased  public  and  media  exposure  of  ENGOs  grants  them  avenues  to  allow  them  to  reach the general public via their various campaigns, and more increasingly via electronic  media  and  the  internet.    Increased  media  exposure,  and  in  turn  public  perception  and  public  voice,  elevates  the  sensitivity  of  government  to  adjust  public  policy  based  on  ENGO and public pressure.  For instance,  in the  case of the Vancouver Island  Marmot,  the  Marmot  Recovery  Foundation  and  its  pervasiveness  via  electronic  and  other  media  campaigns as well as the designation of the "cute" species as a mascot for an important  international event highly increases the visibility of the species, while other more obscure  species at risk  may  not have the  benefit of  "cuteness", charisma, and  heightened public  interest.  As a consequence, obscure species may lag behind on the species at risk policy  agenda, subsequently suffering from a lack of recovery efforts and funding.  In addition, extensive academic and scientific research has been conducted on the  Vancouver Island  marmot over a period of about thirty  years, having  been the  focus of  conservation  efforts  since  the  1980s  (Vancouver  Island  Marmot  Recovery  Team,  2008:  11).    The  heightened  academic  and  intellectual  investment  in  a  species  allows  for  informed policy and decision making.  On the other hand, more obscure species may not  reap the same benefits.  The case of the Vancouver Island Marmot in particular serves to  highlight the imbalance and partiality.  Current scientific information is crucial to informing recovery strategies.  The BC  government  must  ensure  that  critical  habitat  is  defined  in  all  recovery  strategies.    For  instance, in the case of the Vancouver Island Marmot, if the captive breeding program is  to be successful in the long term, it is imperative that marmot critical habitat be defined

126 

within  the  recovery  plan.    Once  it  is  defined,  adequate  policy  must  be  established  and  proper  protectionist  measures  be  set  in  place  via  an  effective  action  plan  in  order  to  protect the habitat.  Proper enforcement measures are also imperative in order to ensure  that protectionist measures are being appropriately implemented.  As  is  apparent  in  all  the  other  case  studies,  mobilization  to  protect  a  species  by  preserving  its critical  habitat is  imperative.  Recovery  strategies are only as good as the  scientific  information they are  based on.  It is  important to base  maps of critical  habitat  on existing sound science.  The importance of quality and availability of information for  establishing adequate protectionist measures is a theme that arises in all cases.  Yet, the  case  of  the  Vancouver  Island  Marmot  in  particular  illustrates  that  policy  makers  must  embrace  scientific  information  and  include  it  among  the  set  of  policy  tools  to  facilitate  species at risk preservation.  Currently, all available  information  is  not being utilized to  its  full  potential,  as  shown  by  a  lack  of  definition  of  critical  habitat  within  recovery  strategies for this species, alongside many other BC species at risk.

CHAPTER  9.0  CONCLUSIONS  AND  APPLICATIONS  FOR  FUTURE  RESEARCH  This thesis  is a representation of the policy cycle  in action.  It  is  specifically an  example of an evaluation of policy analysis (see Figure 1.1, (5)).  The recommendations  for change or reform of existing legal tools for species at risk legislation can be applied to  various Canadian jurisdictions.  It is hoped that this thesis will continue paving the way to  similar  research  on  other  case  studies  that  may  uncover  similar  challenges  for  different  species at risk, or with the same species in different jurisdictions.  An interpretive qualitative evaluation of existing legal tools for species at risk in  Canada  was  conducted.    Case  studies  were  used  to  stress  the  importance  of  current  scientific  information  and  a  precautionary  approach  in  the  formulation  of  policy  instruments for the protection of species at risk, in light of the current biodiversity crisis  in Canada.  The evaluation led to a questioning of the effectiveness of the existing legal  measures in light of the overarching policy goal of preserving species at risk.  Several  important  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  the  research.    The  causes  of  biodiversity  loss  must  be  understood  and  one  must  rely  on  the  best  available  scientific  facts  to  find  these  answers.    The  protection  of  species  at  risk  is  central  to  mitigating  extinctions.  As extracted from the case study analysis, it is becoming ever apparent that  Canadian legal tools are presently not sufficient to promote and sustain biodiversity and  ecosystem  health  in  Canada.    Especially  at the  provincial  level  of  government,  existing  legal  measures  are  not  adequately  protecting  endangered  species.    The  effectiveness  of  these tools were assessed and highlighted by the case studies.  Federal protection alone  is  not sufficient to protect all species at risk  in  Canada.  For this  reason,  provincial  legal  measures  must  be  strengthened  to  make  up  for  federal  weaknesses.  Ontario currently has dedicated species at risk protection:  the Endangered  Species Act, 2007.  British Columbia, on the other hand, relies solely on statutes that very  briefly mention species at risk, yet are not dedicated to their protection.  After comparing  both provinces, it is recommended that interjurisdictional cooperation is the best option  for protecting  species at risk.  Such cooperation  would  strengthen the  impact of federal  initiatives  given  the  limits  of  their  application across  provincial  jurisdictions.  It  is  also

129 

recommended  that  provinces  enact  dedicated  species  at  risk  legislation  similar  to  the  Ontario statute.  The significance of this research consists in its contributions to the scientific and  legal  literature,  particularly  considering  the  relative  scarcity  of  discussions  that  specifically focus on species at risk protection at the provincial level.  A crucial focus of  the research is on the importance of provincial policy tools for the protection of species at  risk  in  Canada,  in  cooperation with  federal  legal  measures.   An emphasis on  incentives  for private landowner participation and understanding the crucial role these stakeholders  play in species at risk protection in Canada is also an integral component of the research.  The case study method serves to highlight inadequacies and implementation gaps in the  existing  legal  measures.    In  essence,  the  overarching  message  of  the  research  is  the  requirement for more effective management tools for the problem of biodiversity loss and  species  at risk  in  Canada.  These tools  must be rooted in scientific understanding  about  the  specific  causes  of  species  decline  and  the  habitat  requirements  for  the  recovery  of  declining species.  Legal and management tools must be implemented at both the federal  and provincial levels for more comprehensive management of species at risk in Canada.  The  recommendations  based  on  the  evaluation  of  legal  inadequacies  are  elaborated in Chapter 8.  An overarching theme  is the  importance of  interjurisdictional  and  intrajurisdictional  cooperation  for  effective  species  at  risk  policy  the  careful  and  scientifically informed use of flexibility instruments, permits, and exemptions to existing  law  and  the  importance  of  funding  private  landowner  stewardship  efforts.    Scientific  information  and  the  proper  definition  of  critical  recovery  habitat  for  species  at  risk  alongside the importance of using a precautionary approach are also discussed.  Evidently,  there  is  much  more  research  potential  in  the  realm  of  endangered  species  in  light  of  the  heightening  biodiversity  crisis.    The  issue  has  reached  vast  proportions  on  global  and  local  scales.    It  is  imperative  that  all  stakeholders  including  governments, decision makers, private landowners and citizens be sufficiently informed.  Armed with the proper information, each stakeholder can play a crucial role in attempting  to reverse the crisis by protecting species at risk.  The  research  is  centered  on  species  at  risk  policy  and  legislation  in  federal  and  provincial  jurisdictions.    An  expanded  analysis  of  the  cooperation  between  different

130 

jurisdictions  in  a  harmonized  effort  to  protect  all  officially  listed  species  at  risk  would  make  for  an  interesting  followup.    In  addition  to  the  research  on  interjurisdictional  cooperation,  and  also  stemming  from  the  current  research  at  hand,  recommendations  could  be  made  to  allow  for  the  cooperation  of  municipalities  via  the  development  of  specific policies and regulations in support of protection for certain endangered species.  This could be initiated through interjurisdictional agreements.  For instance, in the case  of  the  Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike,  house  cats  and  feral  cats  as  well  as  pesticides  are  detrimental to the health of the species and have greatly contributed to its drastic decline  in number (Eastern Loggerhead Shrike Recovery, n.d.).  Municipal regulations requiring  that house cats be kept  indoors and the  introduction of programs to reduce the  feral cat  population  could  be  potential  options  to  control  the  outdoor  feline  population.    In  a  similar light, pesticide bans or the introduction of limits to amounts of pesticides used for  cosmetic purposes are reasonable steps that  municipalities can take to participate  in the  effort to help reverse declines in migratory songbird populations like that of the Eastern  Loggerhead  Shrike.    Hence,  it  is  imperative  not to  underestimate  the  importance  of  the  municipal jurisdiction, even though this particular level of government was not discussed  thoroughly  here.    This  is  definitely  an  important  area  of  future  species  at  risk  policy  research.  Alongside the contributions to future policy reform and development, the policy  recommendations that resulted from the case study evaluations could lead to applications  involving  nongovernmental  organizations  and  other  active  partners  involved  in  stewardship  initiatives.    Another  application  includes  the  furnishing  of  important  information that will aid ENGOs in developing policy documents and campaigns.  The  present  research  will  also  set  the  stage  for  future  directions  whereby  the  policy analysis of legal protection of species at risk can be expanded to other cases.  For  instance,  the  Polar  Bear  is  of  timely  interest.   The  species  was  not  included  among  the  case studies in my research because it is a species that merits individual attention that is  beyond the  scope of this paper.   Also, analysis of  legal  protection of  marine organisms  and  marine  mammals  is  warranted,  especially  considering  that  the  federal  government  has  full  jurisdiction  over  marine  environments  and  inland  fisheries.    Policy  on

131 

aquaculture and the farming of fish could also be included in future research (Volpe and  Shaw, 2008).  Other  future  directions  of  the  present  research  could  include  a  comparative  analysis  of  similar  case  studies  in  other  jurisdictions,  such  as  the  United  States.    The  significance  of  multilateral  international  agreements  and  their  effects  on  the  protection  of these species could also be analyzed to see whether the agreements are adequate and if  they are being followed.  Such research would help uncover any implementation gaps in  legal tools in other jurisdictions where endangered species reside.
