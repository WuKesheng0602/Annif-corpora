EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON THE STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOR OF INSULATED SANDWICH FOAM-TIMBER PANELS UNDER COMBINED AXIAL COMPRESSION AND BENDING
By Mahmoud Mohamed. Master of Applied Sciences in Civil Engineering Department of Civil Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto

2009

ABSTRACT
Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) can significantly reduce emissions produced by our homes and commercial buildings by reducing the amount of energy used for heating and cooling. A SIP is composed of expanded polystyrene insulation (EPS) board laminated between two oriented-strand boards (OSB). SIPs are used all over the world because of their superior strength and quality build. The objective of this thesis it to evaluate the effectiveness of the foam core in providing composite action in SIPs under axial and bending loads to meet both the strength and serviceability requirements. This thesis presents the experimental program and the results of 32 full-size panels tested to-collapse at the Structures Laboratory of Ryerson University. The data generated from this extensive experimental program can easily be used to determine the load carrying capacity of the SIP walls when subjected to axial compressive loading or combined axial compressive loading and bending moment.

Keywords: Sandwich panels, Test methods, experiments, codes and standards, serviceability and strength limit states, wall construction, combined axial and bending.

CHA PTER I INTRODUCTION

1.1 General
The structural insulated panel (SIP) is an engineered composite product composed of an insulating foam core sandwiched to provide the insulation and rigidity, and two face-skin materials to provide durability and strength The core material may take the form of oriented strand board (OSB), traded plywood, fibre-cement board, and sheet metal. The SIP can be compared, structurally, to an I-beam; the foam core acts as the web, while the facings are analogous to the !-beam's flanges as shown in Fig. 1.1. In case of flexural loading, all of the elements of a SIP are stressed; the skins are in tension and compression, while the core resists shear and buckling. Under axial concentric in-plane loading, the facings of a SIP act as slender columns, and the core stabilizes the facings and resists forces that may cause local bucking of the facings. However, in the conventional stud wall system shown in Fig. 1.2, the studs transfer the load from the roof and floor down to the foundation, while the foam is installed between studs to provide insulation. SIPs are usually available in a thickness ranging fron1 100 to 350 mm, depending on climate conditions. These panels can be used in industrial, commercial and residential construction as lading. However, their significant use is walls, floors and roofs in lowrise residential buildings and as basement walls, as shown in Figs. 1.4. The energy saving insulation, design capabilities, cost effectiveness, speed of construction and exceptional strength make SIPs the future material for high performance buildings.

1.2 The Problem
The developed structural insulated sandwich timber panels compnse insulated foam glued between two OSB boards. To determine the structural adequacy of the level of adhesion
1

between the foam and the OSB boards and the level of composite action between them, it is fel t
necessary to conduct experimental testing to-collapse on the developed structural insulated sandwich timber panels. Clause 8.6 of the Canadian Standard for Engineering Design of Wood, CAN/CSA-086-01, (2001) specifies the effective stiffness, bending resistance and shear resistance of stressed skin panels. These stressed skin panels have continuous or splice longitudinal web metnbers and continuous or spliced panel flanges on one or both panel faces, with the flanges glued to the web members. These strength equations are not applicable to SIPs since they do not address the adequacy of the foam as the main shear carrying eletnent near the supports and the connector between the facings at the maximum motnent location. Also, CAN/CSA-086-01 specifies expressions for the effects of combined axial and bending on the titnber stud walls and posts which are applicable to SIPs. However, the available CAN/CSA086-01 compressive resistance equations for studs and posts can not be applied to SIPs as a result of their structural perfom1ance at failure. The technical guide of Canadian Construction Materials Conunission (CCMC) and National Research Council Canada (NRC) for stressed skin panels (with lumber 1200 mm o.c. and EPS core) for walls and roof, formed the basis for the experimental testing conducted in this thesis for flexure, axial eccentric and axial concentric, with the ultimate goal of providing enough technical data for strength and serviceability of the · developed structural insulated sandwich timber panels. With this database, design tables can be established. CAN/CSA-S406, Construction of Preserved Wood Foundations, (1992) allows the use of permanent wood foundation (PWF) which is referred to in Part 9 of the National Building Code of Canada (2006) and in provincial building codes as applied to buildings not exceeding 557 square meter in building area and not more than two storeys high. Building that exceed these limits must be designed according to Standard CSA 086.1, Engineering Design on Wood, which

2

is referenced in Part 4 of the NBCC. The P\VFs are loe1d-beari ng \VOocl-frame system des igned
as foundation for light frame construction. They are built using lumber and plywood, pressuretreated with approved water-borne wood preservatives. Design information for PWFs made of lumber studs is available which it is as yet unavailable for SIPs. Clause 4.1.1.4 of the 2005 Ontario Building Code (Institute for Research in Construction-2005) specifies that buildings and their structural members shall be designed by one of the following methods: (a) standard design procedures and practices provided by Part 4 of this code and any standards and specifications referred to in this code, except in cases of conflict the provisions of the building code shall govern, or (b) one of the following three bases of design,

(i) analysis based on generally established theory,
(ii) evaluation of a given full-scale structure or a prototype by a loading tester, or (iii) studies of model analogues, provided the design is carried out by a person qualified in the specific rnethod applied and provided the design ensures a level of safety and perfom1ance at least equivalent to that provided for or implicit in the design carried out by the methods referred to in Clause (a) above.

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 General Structural insulated panel (SIP) is a composite building material. It consists of tWo layers of structural board with an insulating layer of foam in between. The board is usually oriented strand board (OSB) and the foam either expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) or polyurethane foam. Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) are prefabricated insulated structural elements for use in building walls, ceilings, floors and roofs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the average U.S. home releases 22,000 lbs of carbon dioxide (C02) into the atmosphere each year. This is twice the amount of the average vehicle. By reducing the amount of energy · used for heating and cooling, SIPs can significantly reduce emissions produced by our hon1es and commercial buildings. Building with SIPs is better bec·a use it is more comfortable, stronger & safer, lightweight, faster to construct, more resource efficient, healthier living environment, save money, wave of the future, greater energy savings, straighter walls and more design friendly. A basic SIPs panel is made from Orientated Strand Board (OSB) facing boards with a Polyurethane core. SIPs can be used to construct the floor, walls and roof of a building enabling uniform detailing at interfaces providing continuity of insulation and minimal air leakage. The literature review conducted is presented in the following 1nanner: 1. History of SIPs; 2. Types of Structural insulated sandwich panels; 3. Structural analysis and design of Sandwich panels; and 4. Experimental studies.

2.2 H istory of SIPs SIPs are environmentally friendly and ecologically sound. SIPs are the innovative building constn1ction method of the twenty first century allowing the rapid deployment of buildings for domestic and commercial use. SIPs are structural insulated panels used to construct buildings. In the past, a significant an1ount of research was conducted to predict the behaviour of sandwich panels. Ho·wever, only very few researchers have undertaken experimental studies to investigate the accuracy of design of timber sandwich panels. Building panels come in many configurations, known variously as foam-core panels, stressed-skin panels, nail-base panels, sandwich panels, and curtain-wall panels, among others. Many of these building panels are non-structural, while some have no insulation. And the term "panelized construction" can also include prefabricated stud walls and other configurations associated with the 1nodular industry.

The SIPs have been used extensively in the USA and Canada over the past 50 years but the historical development of the theory of sandwich panels shows that a very few papers have been published which deal with the bending and buckling of sandwich panels with cores which are rigid enough to make a significant contribution to the bending stiffness of the panel, yet flexible enough to permit significant shear deformations (Allen, 1969). 1935- The concept of a structural insulated panel began as the Forest Products Lab (FPL) builds the first in a series of experin1ental SIP houses in Madison, WI. 194 7- FPL builds the Experimental Sandwich building, which is tested and monitored for 31 years. The structure is still in use today. · 1952- Alden P. Dow, one of the Wright's students, builds SIP homes in Midland, MI. 1958- NAHB builds demonstration research homes with SIPs.

2.3 Types of Common Stru ctura l In sulated Sandvrich panels

2.3.1. Fiber Cement Faced Structural Insulated Panels
SIPs are engineered laminated panels with solid foam cores and structural sheathing on each side. The most common types of sheathing or skins materials are oriented strand board (OSB) and plywood. Cement Faced Structural Insulated Panels can be used for below grade applications, as foundation or basement walls, and· above grade applications, as floors. Some manufacturers produce cementitious SIPs with typically n1anufactured fiber cellulose reinforced cement boards for inside and outside skins. Fiber cellulose reinforced cement boards eliminate the need for gypsmn drywall for fire resistance and can be taped and finished on the interior surface. The exterior surface is painted or coated with a vinyl or synthetic stucco permanent finish. OSB can be used instead of cellulose reinforced cetnent board for Fiber Cement Faced Structural Insulated Panels to accept brick veneer wall ties, to accept nailing of siding and for _ · stucco applications. Cetnentitious SIP spans are up to 5 m, load-bearing walls up to four stories and roof panels up to 6 m spans. Cementitious SIPs are fastened together with power-driven screws through the inner and outer skins into either cement board or wood splines. Cen1entitious SIP is as energy efficient as OSB SIP and has similar connection details those of OSB-sheathed panels. Cementitious SIPs typically last longer and require less .maintenance than other types of SIPs panels. Cementitious SIP has higher strength, higher fire rating, higher rot and vermin resistance, higher resistance to moisture absorption and lighter in weight than OSB SIP. Cementitious SIP is air tight as it has continuous air barrier with very low air leak, fully insulated with uniform insulation coverage and thermal bridge panels. Cementitious SIP has finishes as smooth finish, stucco, vinyl siding, brick or stone which can be installed.

8

2.3.2 Precast Co ncre te San dwic h Pane l Concrete panels have been in use for more than 50 years. Precast concrete sandwich panels are made with two reinforced slabs of high strength concrete. The space between concrete slabs is filled with a sound attenuating foam barrier. To make precast concrete sandwich panels, a first concrete slab is formed having embedded in it one end of connectors which extend from it's surface in two directions with the path between the two containing only thermally insulative material, a layer insulative material is positioned adjacent to a central portion of said connectors to form a solid layer and a second layer of concrete is cast so as to receive the upper ends of said connectors. The connectors provide resistance to shear in at least two directions and include insulative high tensile strength members extending in more than one direction between the concrete slabs. The face shells of sandwich panel's main functions are providing protection to the insulation and n1eeting the immediate demands of handling and in1posed loads. The face shells of sandwich panels must continue to give satisfactory performance under long time service. The structural concrete shells of the sandwich panels were reinforced with welded wire fabric should confirm to ASTM A82-62T, "Cold Drawn Steel wire for concrete reinforcement." They are available with a perfectly smooth face, ready for paint. Provisions are made for electrical boxes and conduits in the panel at the factory. The conduit is stubbed out above the ceiling line for cmmection by the electricians in the field. There is no need to install furring strips and drywall on either side of the demising wall. The precast concrete has benefits as a cladding material. It has strength and solidity, recalling traditional concepts of enclosure, yet is a modem prefabricated product with all the advantages of quality control, 'just-in-ti1ne' site delivery, fast installation and extreme durability. In most cases, precast panels are cast using a n1ix that will simulate the appearance and texture of natural stone, generally known as reconstructed or cast

9

sto ne. Pane ls may also be faced with brick slip s, natural stone or te rracotta tiles . l\'{ost precast concrete cladding systems comprise single layers of factory-manufactured precast concrete that are installed on a building, providing a weather-resistant external finish. Standard sandwich panels, with two layers of precast with insulation between, are a well-established product. The insulating materials were commercially available rigid board stock or batting: one foamed polyurethane plastic, two foamed polystyrene plastics, one glass fiber, one foamed glass and one autoclaved cellular concrete. Brick clad concrete panels have a service life greater than 60 years. The two layers are connected by proprietary stainless steel connectors, typically consisting of wind and shear connectors. The latter are strategically positioned orthogonally to achieve suitable suspension of the outer leaf. The system provides structural integrity as it does not rely on insulation for load transference. Various insulation types can be used, including mineral fibre insulation materials. In order to optin1ise the cladding systetn, the itmer leaf of the sandwich panel n1ay be used as a load-bearing structural elen1ent to support floor units. This provides further efficiencies for the construction process and n1inimises the need to co-ordinate different trades. Exposure conditions n1ay cause temperature and moisture differentials is sandwich construction and these conditions may have a more pronounced effect on the satisfactory long time structural behaviour than do the imposed loads.

2.3.3. Light Weight Steel Frame Panels
As "Light Weight Steel Frame Panels" are an open type of Structural Insulated Sandwich panels, insulation is located on the external side of the frame to overcome the risk of cold bridging. Protection against corrosion of the mild steel panels is provided by galvanizing.

10

2.3.4. Plyvvood San(hvich Panels

Plywood serves as an ideal facing material for the sandwich panels. Plywood Sandwich Panel has high strength and light weight. In addition, it is easily finished, dimensionally stable, and easily repaired if damaged. Polystyrene foams, and paper honey combs can be used as core material in the Plywood Sandwich Panel after considering the resistance of the core material to shearing forces, to heat and vapour transmission, to degradation by heat, age, and moisture; and compatibility with glues.

2.4 Structural Analysis and Design of Sandwich Panels
Sandwich panel is consisting of two relatively thin faces and a foamed plastic core. The structural performance of the Sandwich panels depends on the two faces and the core acting together as a composite element, and this raises unique design problems, not all of which may be fully understood by those responsible for their n1anufacture, design, and use. Sandwich panels have flexible cores therefore their behaviour is more complex than that of the plain plates and it is important to understand the numerous failure modes of sandwich panels so that appropriate design criteria can be developed. In addition to face buckling, the other possible modes of failure are as follows: · Failure of fasteners · crushing of the sandwich panel at a point of support or line load · yielding of metal face in tension · shear of the core, including shear bond failure · Failure of the sandwich panel at a point of connection · Blistering

11

T he expected service life of all the structural pane l sys tems is in excess of 60 yea rs. The fully profiled sandwich panels are susceptible to local buckling effects under compression, bending, or their combinations. Extensive research has been carried out in Europe and USA to investigate the behaviour and design of sandwich panels for different failure conditions. In Canada, the choice of faces and cores is not infinite; face materials may be available in relatively few gauges or standard thicknesses; core materials are restricted in the choice of thickness and density. Since the plate elements of the profiled sandwich panels are supported by foam core, their local buckling behaviour is significantly better than that of plate elements without foam core. Buckling of the panels may occur at a stress level lower than the yield stress of steel, but the panels, particularly those with low b/t ratios, will have considerable post-buckling strength. Such local buckling and post-buckling phenomena are very important in the design of sandwich panels. The process of trial and error is often the most effective n1ethod of designing sandwich panels. Design methods should be as precise as the final analysis or check calculation and should indicate roughly where the process of trial and error should begin. The practical usage of sandwich panels as the cladding of buildings has increased dramatically in recent years. This has stimulated increased activity in research and development as a result of which most technical probletns associated with this form of construction have been solved but still a lot of research needed to be done on: · The influence of the shear flexibility of the core on the global behaviour. · The influence of the core in restraining local buckling of the faces. · The variability of core material properties.

12

· The influence of temperature-induced stresses has to be considered as structural sand\vich panels have low thermal capacity, poor fire resistance with rigid plastic foam cores and it may defonn when one side of faceplate is exposed to intense heat. · Creep under sustained load with rigid foam cores . · The influence of deflections.

The basic concept of a sandwich panel is that the faceplates carry the bending stresses and the core carries the shear stresses. As a sandwich with thick faces and a weak core is an inefficient sandwich because the faces are working as two independent elements, one short cut is to ignore completely any effects due to the thickness of the faces. For identification and comparison for core tnaterial properties, density, shear strength, shear modulus and compression modulus have to be determined by test for each panel type produced. Classical methods of analysis solutions have only been derived for a few sin1ple cases of greatest practical significance. An early contribution to the subject was made by Chong and Hartsock and their colleagues. A-useful approximate solution for panels which have either one or both faces profiled has been given by Wolfel ( 1978). He makes the usual assumption that the applied load is shared between two separate load-carrying systems -- namely, the sandwich part, which includes the influence of core shear; and the flange part, which merely involves bending of the flanges. He then makes the further assumption that these two systems are quite independent, except that their deflections coincide at some critical point, usually at the mid-span. This method is vvorth describing in a little more detail because, as well as yielding equations of practical value, if also provides a valuable insight into the way in which sandwich panels behave. If the bending stiffness of the faces is neglected, we have the 'sandwich part' of the section which carries load as

13

a consequence of axial forces in the tl angcs and a shear force, in the core. \Vhen irregul ar
loading or support conditions arise, it becomes necessary to resort to numerical methods of analysis. Jungbluth and Berner (1986) have described a finite difference approach which appears to be the favoured method in Germany. An alternative numerical method, related to the finite element solution, has been given by Schwmize (1984). Yet another technique has been . developed in the US in which thin faces are n1odelled by finite shell strips and relatively weak cores by finite prisms (Chong, 1986). However, for general purposes, it is believed that the conventional finite element method offers the best approach. In many applications, the finite element method is approximate and it is necessary to use a large number of elements in order to obtain accurate solutions. For three-layered sandwich beams, the solutions are exact and the minimum number of elements necessary to model the problem \vill give a precise solution. The general solution for the bending of panels with profiled faces was first given by the author (Davies, 1986), who then extended it to panels subject to combined axial load and bending, giving solutions for panels with both flat and profiled faces (Davies, 1987). As the fom1er is a special case of the latter, there is little point in omitting the axial load terms when programming the method.

2.4.1 Historical Development of Sandwich Theory
In recent years, sandwich panels are increasingly used in building structures particularly as roof and wall cladding systems. They are also being used as internal walls and ceilings. Because of their good thermal properties, they have been used in cold-storage buildings. Sandwich (S W) structures are three-layer high performance lightweight structures (Wiedemann,

1996; Stamm and Witte, 1974; Plantema, 1966), consisting of a soft core which is covered by

14

stiff skin layers . They are characterized by both excellen t bend ing stiffness and low weight. However, due to their comparatively high shear flexibility, the global behaviour concerning deflection and buckling is described by a shear flexible theory (Mindlin, R. 1951; Reissner, E. 1945), where only the membrane stresses in the thin skin layers are considered, whereas the inplane stresses appearing in the core are neglected. This theory is known as the Sandwich Membrane Theory (SWMT), which has proven to be reliable for a long time. Past research (Davies and Hakmi, 1992, 1991) has investigated the local buckling behaviour and developed n1odified effective width rules for the plate elements in sandwich panels. For an at least approximate description of both global structural behaviour of SW and local phenomena, the SWMT must be extended. For this purpose (Kuhhom, 1993, Kuhhom, 1991; Kuhhom and Schoop, 1992) presented a thickness flexible, geometrically nonlinear SW-shell theory using seven kinematic degrees of freedom. This theory is able to solve the problems tnentioned above with sufficient accuracy if the local perturbations considered are characterized by wavelengths which are not too short (numerical investigations show that this theory is applicable for wrinkling problems characterized by half waves longer than 0.8-times of the core thickness). This extended theory includes the independent bending stiffness of each skin separately. Also a linear thickness stretch distribution over the height of the core is taken into account whereas the core in-plane stresses remain unconsidered. Due to the increasing interest in the use of structural sandwich panels, a good deal of research has continued in recent years (Davies, 1993). Research and developn1ent of sandwich panels with profiled faces began only in late 1960s (Chong and Hartsock, 1993). These rules can be applied successfully for plate elements with low width to thickness ratios (b/t), but their applicability to slender plates is questionable. In sandwich panel construction, the b/t ratio can be as large as 600 (Mahendran and Jeevaharan, 1999). To

15

investigate the app licabi lity of current design rules for slender plates vvith such large b/t ratios, a
detailed investigation into the local buckling behaviour of profiled sandwich panels was conducted using extensive series of laboratory experiments on 50 foam supported steel plates. The static behaviour and strength of sandwich panels is based on the composite action of the three structural layers, namely the two faces and the core (Davies, 2001 ). For design purposes, such local buckling and post buckling problems are treated by utilizing the concept of effective width principles.

2.4.1.1 The General Method

The general method has been investigated by Reissner (1948) in relation to isotropic panels with very thin faces. It has been concluded that the effect of core flexibility in the zdirection is less important than the effect of core shear deformation in the transverse planes. A relatively simple differential equation for the transverse displacement has been driven by neglecting the effect of direct transverse core strains. A very similar equation to Reissner's equation has been driven by Eringen (1951) where the geometrical thickness of the equal faces was neglected, and their local bending stiffnesses and also the bending stiffness of the core was included. By the assumption that the vertical and horizontal displacements in the core are directly proportional to z-direction, the inclusion of the latter is contradicted to some extent. A much more recent analysis conducted by Heath (1960) also included a very similar equation, but for a sandwich with an orthotropic core. Heath's analysis was based on earlier work by He1np (1948) and is apparently independent ofReissner's work (1945).

Raville ( 1955) npp li ed the gene ral n1ethod to the problem of

rectangular panel with uniform transverse load and with thin faces. The three displacements of points in the orthotropic anti-plane core are expressed as polynomials in z, but the complexity of the analysis again makes it necessary to revert to the simplifying assumption of infinite core stiffness in the z-direction. For practical purposes the general method is evidently intractable when applied to sandwich panels, but more success has been achieved in relation to sandwich struts and beams. The early works of Williams et al (1941) and Cox and Riddell (1945) fall into this category. The first of these deals with a sandwich strut with thick faces and an isotropic core (with an extension for orthotropic cores) and the analysis is used to form a link between the extreme cases of wrinkling instability (no longitudinal displacement of the faces during buckling) and of overall Euler-type instability, modified for shear deformations in the core (no direct core strains in the z-direction). A very thorough analysis of the behaviour of struts with isotropic faces and cores has been outlined by Goodier (1946) and Goodier and Neou (1951 ).

2.4.1.2 The Selective Method
Selective method; bending problem Most of published work on sandwich panels refers to the selective method and, in particular, to the bending problem, in which core strains in the z-direction is neglected. The assumption that the core is weak in the xy-plane leads in any case to the conclusions that the core makes no contribution to the flexural rigidity of the sandwich, that the core shear stresses in zx and yz planes, are independent of z and that a straight line drawn in the unloaded core normal to the faces remains straight after deformation, but is no longer normal to the faces. These assumptions (core weak in xy-plane, stiff in z-direction) allow the displacements of the panel to be expressed

t\VO

The literature of the wrinkling problem is less extensive than that of the bending problem. As has been mentioned, wrinkling is characterized by its short waves involving bending of the skins and compression or elongation of the core material in the transverse direction. This type of local failure occurs when the core thickness is such t h at the overall buckling is not likely to happen. The problem o f symmetrical wrinkling of sandwich panels was studied by many investigators with the first major paper by Gough et al. (1940). It contains an examination of the stability of a straight strut stabilized in various ways by an isotropic elastic medium. Some of the cases considered are directly applicable to the compression faces of sandwich beams and to the antisymmetrical wrinkling of sandwich struts which it n1ay be referred to it as a "skew ripple". An analysis of the same kind is made by Hoff and Mautner (1945) for sy1nmetrical wrinkling of sandwich struts. In all these studies, a linear distribution of the transverse displacement through the core was considered, and the faces were treated as plates on elastic foundation. The analytic solution for the symn1etrical wrinkling stress can be obtained by using an elasticity approach. The assumptions commonly accepted for this type of analysis are: The in-plane stresses in the core are neglected. That is, with X-Y axes in the plane of a sandwich plate, and Z- axis perpendicular to it: in which normal, shear stresses and subscript denoting the core. Thus, the relevant deformations in the core are in the transverse direction and shear deformations in XZ and YZ planes. The wrinkling consists of a plane deformation. Thus, if a sandwich panel is compressed in X- direction, the lateral deflection is independent of y. The core can be treated as a semi-infinite medium in which the displacement decreases exponentially with maximum value

18

at the interface \V ith the skin. The faces are th in in compariso n \vith the core th ickness. This
implies that the deflection of each face is identified with the displacement of the core at its surface. The effect of Poisson's ratio of the core material is neglected.

2.4.1.3 Flexural Stresses in Sandwich Panels
A number of researchers have studied the failure modes of sandwich stn1ctures in flexure

(Zenkert et al., 2002; Thomsen, 1995; Yoshii, 1992; Triantafillou and Gibson, 1987). Triantafillou and Gibson studied failure modes of sandwich beams with aluminum face sheets and a rigid polyurethane foam core. Failure maps for various core densities and span-to-depth ratios were constructed for face yielding face wrinkling, core yield in shear, and core yield in tension and compression. Based on similar failure equations, a weight optimum design of composite sandwich structures was proposed by Yoshii ( 1992). A sumn1ary of design approaches to sandwich construction may be found in a book published by Zenkert ( 1997) while information on cellular solids is available elsewhere (Gibson and Ashby, 1988). Under flexure a sandwich beam exhibits various failure modes depending on the state of stress and the materials used. The flexural rigidity for the sandwich panel is highly affected the failure mode. It can be defined as the sum of the flexural rigidities of the faces and the core n1easured about the neutral axis of the sandwich cross-section, Allen (1969). The potential failure modes together with the corresponding simplistic failure criteria are sumn1arized below:

1. Face failure in tension or compression: - crfc ~crr~crft
2. Face wrinkling due to compression: crr~0.5(ErEcGc) 3. Core failure in shear:

modulus, G = shear modulus, sub f = face, sub c = core, sub i = interface, sub fc = face compressive strength, sub ft =face tensile strength, sub cs =core shear strength, and sub is = interface shear strength. In case of localized loading, face/core indentation is an additional failure mode.

2.4.1.4 Flexural and Shear Stresses in Sandwich Panels
The use of the terms long beam flexure and short bean1 flexure when addressing sandwich panel testing is very essential, as the former is used to determine face-sheet, i.e. the surface layers of the sandwich panel, properties and the latter to determine core shear properties. Such a distinction is logical since we know that, for a given applied loading, the flexural stresses (tensile and compressive) in the face-sheets increase as beatn length increases, but the shear stresses in the core do not. That is, long beams produce high bending stresses while short span lengths do not. Most recently, Sennah et al. (2009, 2008) and Butt (2008) performed experimental studies on the static flexural and flexural-creep performance of SIPs for roofs and floors in residential construction. The experimental program included testing 52 panels of different thickness and span length under increasing static loading to-collapse. The results proved that the tested SIPS are as good as the conventional timber joist system specified in part 9 of the NBBC, with respect to strength and serviceability.

2.4.1.5 Elastic Deflection Analysis of Sandwich Panels
The plywood Design Specification Supplement, entitled "Design and Fabrication of plywood Sandwich Panels" (APA 1990) si1nplifies the total elastic mid-span deflection (L1r) for the
20

uniformly loaded-simply supported sandw·ich berun with relatively thin and stiff faces , and thick
weak cores. It is simplified to the sum of bending and shear deflection as follows:

Where:

68

=

deflection at mid-span of the sandwich panel due to bending

L1s = deflection at mid-span of the sandwich panel due to shear The form of the elastic bending deflection for a simply-supported homogeneous beam of uniform cross-section in quarter-point loading, as follow: 11PL fl. B = -38_4_E_I

Where:

P = total applied load L =beam span E =modulus of elasticity of the beam tnaterial I = moment of inertia of the uniform cross-section EI = flexural rigidity

As per Allen (1969), by applying the boundary conditions for the simply-supported quarter point load beam (w2 = 0 at x = 0, the maximum shear deflection (at x = L/4) associated with the shear deformation of the sandwich loaded at quarter points is defined by the following equation:
/). =w

Where

A= bd2 /c and AG is referred to as the shear stiffness

P = total applied load L =beam span

G = core shear modulus X = distance from the reaCtion in shear zone of beam w 2 =displacement at x

Thus, the total sandwich beam deflection reflecting the bending and shear component is defined in by the following equation:

t1 = 11 PL + PL s 384D 8AG

2.5 Permanent wood foundation The pennanent wood foundation (PWF), shown in Fig. 2.1, is a complete wood frame · foundation (load-bearing walls) for low-rise, residential, industrial, comn1ercial and other types of buildings (CSA, 1997). All lumber and plywood in PWF is pressure treated with water-borne preservatives. Nails and straps must be corrosion resistant. The walls are designed to resist soil pressure loads in addition to the nonnal vetiicalloads from roofs, floors and top walls. Improved moisture control methods around and beneath the foundation result in comfortable, dry living space below grade. The foundation is placed on a granular drainage layer which extends 300 mm beyond the fo.otings. Porous backfill is brought up to within 300 mm of finished grade and the remaining space filled with less permeable or native soil sloped away from the house. The porous drainage material directs ground water to below the basement, thus preventing hydrostatic pressure and leaks in he basement walls or floors. A sump is provided, in accordance with the building code, and is drained by mechanical or gravity means. No drainage (weeping) tile is needed around the footings as this may impede the flow of water. The granular drainage layer can accon1modate a large influx of water during peak storm conditions. It also provides a

22

large surface area fo r water to percolate into the subsoi l. Cau lking bet\Yeen all wa ll pane ls and between the walls and the footings, and a moisture barrier applied to the outside of the walls provide additional protection against moisture. The result is a dry basement that can be easily insulated and finished for maximum comfort and energy conservation. PWF has many other advantages including (i) increased living space since drywall can be attached to the foundation wall studs, (ii) rapid construction, whether framed on site or prefabricated off-site, and (iii) buildable during winter times using minimal measures around the footings to protect them from freezing. CAN/CSA-S406, Construction of Preserved Wood Foundations, (CSA, 1992) allows the use of permanent wood foundation (PWF) which is referred to in Part 9 of the National Building Code of Canada (Institute for Research in Construction-2005) and in provincial building codes. It describes the required materials and methods of construction of permanent wood foundations made of lumber studs. While more design information is available in the CSA book "Pern1anent Wood Foundation (CSA, 1997). Design info1mation of PWF n1ade of SIPs is as yet unavailable.

CHAPTER III EXPERIMENTAL STUDY

3.1 General
The SIPs which have been used in the experimental study, are produced by Thermapan Inc. in standard sizes of 1.2 m wide and lengths of 2.43, 2.72, 3.05, 3.66, 4.27 and 4.90 m. SIPs can be used in used for many different applications, such as interior and exterior walls, roofs, floors, foundations, ti1nber fran1e, additions, and renovations. Thermapan SIPs are composed of thick layer of expanded polystyrene insulation (EPS) board laminated between two sheets of oriented strand board (OSB), as shown in Figure 3 .1. The facing of these developed panels is made of two faces of Oriented Strand Board (OSB), 11 mm (7 /16") thickness, holding a foam core for floor and wall constn1ction. These SIPs meets building code for many residential and commercial applications based on the R-Value, as shown in Table 3.1 (Thern1apan, 2007).

SIP floors and roofs are installed by placing the panels side by side as shown in Fig. 1.3. The joint between the panels in the span direction can be either foam-spline connection or lumber-spline connection. In the foam-spline connection, shown in Fig. 3.2, a recess is formed in the foam core at the long edges of the panels. A foam block, with two OSB facings glued to it, is inserted at the edge of one panel. Then, the other panel is slide over the spline. The block OSB facings are then nailed to the OSB of the connected panels which provides structural integrity to the floor or wall. Figure 3.2 shows a typical section of foan1-spline connection before and after assembly. The width of the insert for the foan1-spline connection is usually half the width of the solid sawn lumber. It is preferred for roof construction to assist in energy efficiency. In case of lumber-spline joint, shown in Fig. 3.3, a recess in formed along the longitudinal edges of the

24

foam during manufacturing. After placing the panel O"Ver the wall, a saYvn lurnber is inseriecl in the recess along the panel length. Then, the adjacent panel slides over the sawn lumber, followed

by nailing the OSB facings to the solid lumber. Figure 3.3 shows a schematic diagram of the
solid lumber-spline connection. The experimental research program aimed to develop a better understanding of the structural behaviour of these timber sandwich panels at service and ultimate loading conditions when they act as walls or cladding in residential construction. 32 tests were performed on different panel sizes at the structures laboratory of Ryerson University to provide experimental data that would then be evaluated for building code compliance. This chapter summarizes the geometrical and material properties of the tested panels, the different setups for the tests, and the test procedure.

3.2 Description of Panels:
The tested panels were divided into 9 groups based on the size or the panel, the connection between adjacent panels in real structure (i.e. foan1-spline or lumber-spline), and the thickness of the OSB facings. This is in addition to the type of testing to be conducted on the panel group. Tables 3.2 through 3.5 summarize the geometric characteristics of the tested panels. The description of each panel group is summarized as follows.

All panels were n1anufactured for wall constn1ction with 1.2 m wide and 11 n1m (7 /16") thick

OSB boards for the side facings, except for those for basement construction. Group A consisted
of 3 identical panels of 2.73 m (9') length, 165 mm (6 12") total depth, and foam-spline connection. It should be noted that the foam core depth is simply the difference hetween the total depth and the thickness of the two OSB facings. Group B is similar to Group A but with lumber-

25

spline connection. It should be noted that in Groups A and B, the compress ive load \\"as applied
concentrically at the mid-thickness of the panel. Group C consisted of 3 panels identical to those for Group. However, the applied compressive load was eccentric to the mid-thickness of the panel. An eccentricity of t/6 was considered, where t is the thickness of the panel. Group D, E, and F are identical to Group A with respect to geometry and loading except that the length of the panels were 3.05 m (10'), 3.66 m (12'), and 4.90
111

(16'), respectively. Table 3.2 stnnmarizes

panel geometries and loading type for Groups A to F. To examine the effect of combined axial and bending of the capacity of the tested wall panels, it was decided to conducting testing to determine the axial load carrying capacity from the axial load tests as specified in Table 3.2 for zero eccentricity and the resisting motnent of the san1e panels as obtained from flexure tests on identical panels. Table 3.3 summarizes the geon1etries of panel groups G and H which are identical to Groups A and E, respectively, shown in Table 3.2. This type of combined loading is applicable to wall construction over ground. However, to study this combined effect in basement wall construction, identical panel Groups I and J were considered for axial load and flexural load tests, respectively. The size of each panel in these groups was 2.74 n1 (9') length, 1.20 m (4') width and 210 mn1 (8 Y,.") total depth. To allow for the construction of preserved wood foundation the interior facing was made of 11 mm (7/16") OSB sheets, while the exterior facing exposed to soil was made of 15.5 mm (5/8") Canadian softwood plywood.

3.3 Material Properties
The exterior faces of the Thermapan SIPs, are oriented strand board (OSB) manufactured

When expanded Polystyrene exposed to steam, it creates a uniform closed cell structures highly resistant to heat flow and moisture penetration. This process called in-plant expansion process and it is fused into blocks. Blocks are cured for dimensional stability and cut into boards. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) core type 1 has been used to fabricate the panels. The priority density demonstrates a load failure of 25 psi when tested as per ASTM C297. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) core material must meet the standard CAN/ULC-S701 and demonstrate the following characteristics:

To allow for the construction of preserved wood foundation the panel exterior facing exposed to soil was n1ade of 15.5 mm (5/8") Canadian softwood plywood (CSP). CSP has 5 plies and demonstrates the following characteristics: Bending resistance = 520 N .mm/mm if the applied force is in the direction of face grain Bending resistance= 280 N.mm/mm if the applied force is normal to the direction of face grain Bending stiffness, EI = 2000,000 N.mm /mrn if the applied force is in the direction of face grain Bending stiffness, EI = 630,000 N.mm2/mm if applied force is normal to direction of face grain Axial stiffness, EA = 71,000 N/mm if the applied force is in the direction of face grain Axial stiffness, EA = 4 7,000 N/mm if the applied force is normal to the direction of face grain Axial tensile resistance, Tr

For all panels, 2"x0.095" dian1eter, hot-dipped galvanized, gun nails at 8" spacing with %"minimum edge distance to connect the OSB sheets to the foam splines and limber splines. Also, this nail arrangement was used to connect the panel facings to the lumber studs at the top and bottom of the walls.

3.4 Test method for SIP Panels under Axial Compressive Loading
The objective of this set of testing is to provide design tables of wall panels in the fonn of factored design resisting line load. These design tables will assist in establishing the maximum span of joists of roof/floor panels or the maximum span of SIP floor or roof served by SIP wall as based on different snow load values (i.e. 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 kPa for example). For the purpose of structural qualifications of SIPs, the Canadian Construction Materials Commission (CCMC) produced a technical guide (IRC, 2007) in collaboration with the National Research Council Canada (NRC) to describe the technical requirements and performance criteria for the assessment of stressed skin panels (with lumber 1200 mm o.c. and EPS core) for walls and roofs. In this guide, The performance of the stressed skin panels for walls and roofs, have been evaluated, as an alternative solution, with respect to Part 4, Structural Design, and Part 9,

29

Housing and Smal l Build ings, of the National Bu ildin g Code of Canada (NBCC, 2005). The
Technical Guide focuses on structurally qualifying the stressed skin composite panels to be as good as the structural capacity of the conventional wood-frame buildings. A successful evaluation conforming to this Technical Guide will result in a published CCMC Evaluation Report. The published CCMC Evaluation Report is applicable only to products bearing the proper identification number of CCMC's evaluation number. This NRCIIRC/CCMC Technical Guide specifies test methods for SIPs which is similar to those specified in ASTM E72-02, Standard Test Methods for Conducting Strength Tests of Panels for Building Construction, (ASTM, 2002) as well as ICC AC04, Acceptance Criteria for Sandwich Panels, (2004). The ICC AC04 acceptance criteria are based on ASTM E72 standard test methods. The 2008 ANSI/APA PRS-61 0.1, Standard for Performance-Rated Structural Insulated Panels in Wall Applications, published by APA-The Engineered rVood Association in USA, provides sitnilar structural qualification procedure and criteria for the perfom1ance-rated SIPs to those in ASTM E72-02 and ASTM E 1803-06, Test Methods for Determining Structural Capacities of Insulated Panels. ASTM E72-02 specifies at least three identical specimens for each test group. As such, Groups A, B, D, E, F and I have been selected for tests under axial compressive loading as shown in Tables 3.2 and 3.4.

3A.l Axial Compressive Load Test setup
AC04 specifies that load bearing wall panels shall support an axial loading applied with an eccentricity on one-sixth the panel thickness to the interior or towards the weaker facing material of an interior panel. The test setup shall be capable of accommodating rotation of the test panel at the top of the wall due to out-of-plane deflection with the load applied throughout

30

the duration of the t.est with the required eccentri city. AC04 also spec ifi es that the tes t panel shall
have wall sill and cap plate details with connections matching the proposed field installations. Axial loads shall be applied uniformly or at the anticipated spacing of the floor or roof framing.

To prepare for the test, the wall panel aligned vertically and supported directly over the laboratory's floor or over an elevated precast concrete slab units. A unif01mly distributed line load was applied on the top side over the 1200 m width using a loading assembly. This loading assembly was composed of a 1200x350x12 tnm steel base plate resting over the top side of the panel. A 125x125x12.7 mm HSS box beam of length 1200 m1n was welded to the top side of the steel base plate to transfer the applied jacking load over the panel width. Two 70x70 x9 mn1 steel angles of 1200 mm length were welded to the steel base plate, one on each side of the wall panel to stabilize the loading assembly during the test. The weight of the loading assembly was calculated as 1.25 kN. Figure 3.4 and 3.5 show schematic diagrams of the elevation and side view of the test setup for axial loading. While Fig. 3.6 shows schematics diagram of the loading assembly for both concentric and t/6 eccentric compressive loading. Figure 3. 7 shows view of Wall W2 before testing, while Fig. 3.8 shows view of the top loading system for Wall W2. Figure 3.9 and 3.10 show views of the top loading assembly with the concentric and eccentric HSS beam.

3.4.2 Instrumentation for Axial Compressive Load Test
Four Linear Variable Displacement Transducers, (LVDT's) were used to n1easure horizontal displacement at the mid-height of the panel. The four L VDTs were located at the midheight of the wall panel, two on each side of the panel facing. Each LVDT was located at 300

31

mm from the ve rti cal free edge of the wall panels. LV DTs 1 ancl 2 have been install ed on the
south side of the panel while LVDTs 3 and 4 have been installed on the north side of the panel as shown in Fig. 3.11. Four potentiometers (POTs) were installed vertically over the four comers on the top side of the panels as shown in Figs. 3.9 and 3.10 to record axial shortening of the wall panel under load. The compressive load was applied through a jacking load system with a universal flat load cell of 222 kN (50,000 Ib) capacity to measure the jacking load. During testing, the process for collecting and converting data captured by the L VDT' s, POTs and load cell were done using a test control software (TCS) with SYSTEM 5000 data acquisition unit which was adjusted to sample the data at rate of 10 reading per second during the test.

3.4.3 Axial Compression Load Test Procedure
ASTM E72 specifies that wall panels shall be loaded in incrernents to failure with deflections taken to obtain deflections and set characteristics. The tests were performed in the structures laboratory of Ryerson University. The test set-up was prepared for each test which included installing the POTs and LVDTs at the predetermined locations. For each panel, the jacking load was continuously at a slow rate. Visual inspection was continuously conducted during the test record any change in the structural integrity of the wall panel. Each test was terminated after the wall panel failure. Failure of the panel was considered when the recorded jacking load was not increasing or when the panel could not absorb more loads while recorded axial shortening was increasing by continuously pressing the pump handle. Mode of failure was recorded · and test data was then used to draw the load-deflection and load-axial shortening relationships for each panel.

Test m eth od fo r SJP P anels un d er F lexura l Loa d
As it was mentioned earlier, the objective of this test was to establish the factored design

flexural capacity of selected wall panels that would further be uses with the obtained factored design axial compressive load with zero eccentricity to apply the axial load-moment interaction equation to determine either the factored axial load or factored bending moment that can safely be applied on the wall panels. Bending qualification tests on the panels were conducted as specified in the method described in the ASTM £72-02, Transverse Load Test. ASTM E72-02 specifies at least three identical specimens for each test group. Groups G, H and J listed in Tables 3.3 and 3.5.

3.5.1 Flexure Load Test setup
Each tested panel was supported over two 25.4 mm steel rollers at each side in the short direction. 1200x 150x 12 mm steel plates were inserted between the steel rollers and the supporting steel pedestal resting on the laboratory strong floor. Other similar-size steel plates were inserted between the supporting roller and the panel bottom facing. A 150x 150 x I2.7 mm HSS beam of 2400 mm length used to transfer the applied jacking load to a I 02x I 020x6.4 mm HSS beam that was laid transversally over the top panel facing at the quarter points to spread the load over the panel width. Steel roller and plate assetnbly similar to that used to support the panel over the steel pedestals was used to suppo11 the 2400 mm length HSS beam over the two 1200 mm length HSS spread beams at the quarter points. The weight of this loading system is 2.0 kN. Figure 3.13 shows view ofthe test setup ofWS31 wall panel.

33

3.5.2 In strumentation for the F lexure Load Test Mid-span deflection was measured using 4 Linear Variable Displacement Transducers (L VDTs). These LVDTs were positioned underneath the panel, with two L VDTs were located at 25 mm from the panel free edges and other two L VDTs located at the third points of the panel width. Figure 3.14 shows view of the L VDTs installed at mid-span location under panel WB 19. The load was applied through a jacking load system with a universal flat load cell of 222 kN (50,000 Ib) capacity. During each test, the process for collecting and converting data captured by the L VDTs and load cell was done using a test control software (TCS) with a SYSTEM 5000 data acquisition unit which was adjusted to sample the data at rate of 10 reading per second during the loading test.

3.5.3 Flexure Load Test Procedure
Flexural tests were perfonned in the structures laboratory of Ryerson University. The test set-up was prepared for each test as. explained earlier. For each panel, jacking load was applied in increments so that visual inspection could be performed to record any change in structural integrity of the sandwich panel. The tests were terminated after panel failure when the jacking load was not increasing while panel deflection was increasing by continuous pressing of the pump handle. Aj: that stage, failure mode was observed and test data was then used to draw the load-deflection relationships for each panel.

CHAPTER IV
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 4.1 General This Chapter discusses the experimental results of testing to-collapse 32 actual-size timber panels according to ASTM standards to qualify them based on code requirements and test · method criteria The experin1ental results for all panels, in the form of load-axial shortening relationship, load-lateral deflection relationship, and failure pattern, are presented in sequence for each panel group .. The structural adequacy of the tested sandwich panels for possible use in residential construction was presented at the end of the Chapter.

4.2

Code Requirements for the Structural Qualification of the SIPs The Structural qualifications of the SIPs have been assessed based on:

1- The general design principles provided in CSA Standard CAN/CSA-086.1, Engineering Design of Wood; 2- The evaluation criteria set forth in the NRC/CCMC Technical Guide which focuses on SIPs as being "as good as" the conventional wood-frame buildings with respect to strength and serviceability; and 3- CSA Standard CAN/CSA-S406-92, Construction ofPreserved Wood Foundations, (1992) and the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 2005).

Based on NBCC and CAN/CSA-S406, the following loads and load factors can be used to examine the structural adequacy of the panels for serviceability and ultimate limit states design:

35

Dead load bc tor Live load factor Dead load for roofs Dead load for floors

The intensity of the triangular lateral soil pressure= 4. 7 kN/m2 Live load for residential construction= 1.9 kPa Snow load for residential construction= 1.9 kPa (for simplification of comparison) Deflection limit for serviceability (live load effect)= span I 360

The deflection limit of span/360 is a serviceability limit condition which may be waived in case of industrial buildings, with span/180 as live load deflection limit when no roof ceiling is provided and with span/240 when ceilings other than plaster or gypsum are used (NBCC Part 9, 2005). The deflection limit of span/360 is intended to limit floor vibration and to avoid damage to structural elements or attached nonstructural elen1ents. The average deflection and ultimate load carrying capacity of each panels group are basically the average of those for the three panels in each panel group as per the Acceptance criteria for SIPs set forth in ICC-ES AC04 (2004). Further, when the results of one of the tested panel vary more than 15% from the average of the three panels, one of the following two actions was chosen: (i) the lowest test value may be used; or (ii) the average result based on a minimum of five tests tnay be used regardless of the variations. Moreover, the results from two tests could be used when the higher value does not exceed the lower value by more than 5% and the lower value is used with the required factors of safety. Factor of safety for ultimate load carrying capacity of SIPs is dependant on the

followings: (i) consistency of materials, (ii) the range of test results, and (iii) the load-

36

deformation characteristics of the panel. AC 04 generally applies a facto r of safe ty of 3 to the
ultimate load based on the average of three tests which called in this research as panel group. However, for the case of the tested panels in this research, AC04 provides the following factors of safety applicable to uniform transverse loads: F.S. = 3.0 F.S. = 2.5 F.S. = 2.5 for ultimate load at shear failure for all loading conditions. for ultimate reaction at failure for all loading conditions for ultimate load determined by bending (facing buckling) failure under allowable snow loads. F.S. =2 for ultimate load determined by bending (facing buckling) failure under allowable live loads up to 0.958 kPa (20 Lb per square foot).

In case of wall panel axial load tests, AC04 specifies that wall panels shall support an axial loading applied with an eccentricity of 1/6 the panel thickness. Also, AC04 specifies that the factored design resisting axial load is detern1ined from the experimental axial load at a net axial deformation of 3.18 mm (118") or the ultimate load divided by a factor of safety determined in accordance with those specified for transverse load testing mentioned above, whichever is lower.

4.3 Group A

In this group, three identical panels were tested to complete collapse under uniformly distributed axial concentric compression load. Each panel was of 9 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick, with foam-spline connection. Figure 4.1 shows view of panel WI before testing, while Figs. 4.4 through 4.9 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after

37

failure as \V eil as close-up views of the local damage and defo n11ation.

[t

\vas obse rved that the

failure mode in wall Wl was due to OSB facing crushing near the top qumier point on one side of the panel and near the lower quarter point on the other side of the panel that led to global permanent lateral deformation of the panel as shown in Fig. 4.9. It should be noted that local OSB crushing along its connection with the top and bottom wall studs as shown in Figs. 4.5 and 4.7. The failure was abrupt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-axial shortening relationship in Fig. 4.2. It was observed that linear elastic behaviour was maintained till failure.

Figure 4.10 shows view of panel W2 before testing, while Figs. 4.13 through 4.16 show views of the pennanent defonned shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.11 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing near the top part of the wall as well as at the connection with the top wall stud. Figure 4.17 shows view of panel W3 before testing, while Figs. 4.20 through 4.22 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.18 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the 1nodel. It was observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing occurred on one side of the panel near its midheight as well as at the connection with the top wall stud.

Figures 4.3, 4.12, and 4.19 depict the jacking load-lateral deflection relationships for walls W-1, W2 and W3, respectively. It can be observed that lateral deflection increase with increase in the applied load. This may be attributed to the lateral unstability of the OSB facings

38

as a result of the hi gh flex ibility of the foa m in between. Hovveve r lateral deflection is not considered in this study as design criteria per AC04. Table 4.1 shows that the experimental ultimate jacking load was 324.97, 323.27 and 283.84 kN for walls W1, W2 and W3, respectively. As per AC-04, the ultimate factored design axial resisting compressive load is the experimental ultimate load divided by 2.5. Thus, the factored design axial resisting load is 130.00, 129.31 and 113.54 kN for walls WI, W2 and W3, respectively. Since the obtained design values for each walls is within 15% difference with the average value of the three panels, the design factored axial compressive load for Group A is 124.30. kN. This value will be farther be used to examine the axial force-moment interaction for this wall group.

4.4 Group B

In this group, three identical panels were tested to-collapse under uniformly distributed axial concentric compression load. Each panel was of 9 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick, with lumber-spline connection. Figure 4.23 shows view of panel W4 before testing, while Figs. 4.26 through 4.29 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation. It was observed that the failure mode in wall W 4 was due to OSB facing crushing near the top of the panel and that led to global permanent lateral deformation of the panel as shown in Fig. 4.28. Foam-OSB facing delamination at their interface was observed at the same location at failure. The failure was abrupt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-axial shortening relationship in Fig. 4.24. It was observed that linear elastic behaviour was maintained till failure.

Figure 4.30 shows view of panel \V5 before testjn g, \Vhil e Figs . 4. 33 through 4.36 sho\V views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.31 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing near the top quarter point in addition to foam-OSB facing delamination at their interface at the same location. Figure 4.37 shows view of panel W6 before testing, while Figs. 4.40 and 4.41 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.38 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing at the top of the wall. Figures 4.25, 4.32, and 4.39 depict the jacking load-lateral deflection relationships for walls W4, W5 and W6, respectively. It can be observed that lateral deflection increase with increase in the applied load. This may be attributed to the lateral unstability of the OSB facings as a result of the high flexibility of the foam in between. However lateral deflection is not considered in this study as design criteria per AC04. Table 4.1 shows that the experimental ultimate jacking load was 286.35, 286.50 and 344.64 kN for walls W4, W5 and W6, respectively. As per AC-04, the ultimate factored design axial resisting compressive load is the experimental ultimate load divided by 2.5. Thus, the factored design axial resisting load is 114.54, 114.50 and 127.86 kN for walls W4, W5 and W6, respectively. Since the obtained design values for each walls is within 15% difference with the average value of the three panels, the design factored axial compressive load for Group B is 122.30 kN. This value will be farther be used to examine the axial force-moment interaction for .this wall group. One may observe that the design resisting axial compressive load for Group B with lumber spline connection is 1.6%

40

less than that for Group A with foan1 -spline connection. Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of lumber studs at the joint between wall panels has insignificant effect of the load carrying capacity.

4.5 Group C In this group, three identical panels were tested to complete collapse under uniformly distributed axial compression load with t/6 eccentricity. Each panel was of 9 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick, with foam-spline connection. Figure 4.42 shows view of panel W7 before testing, while Figs. 4.45 through 4.47 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation. It was observed that the failure mode in wall W7 was due to OSB facing crushing at one side of its top leading to global permanent lateral deformation of the panel as shown in Fig. 4.45. The failure was abrupt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-axial shortening relationship in Fig. 4.43. It was observed that linear elastic behaviour was n1aintained till failure.

Figure 4.47 shows view of panel W8 before testing, while Figs. 4.50 and 4.51 show views of the pem1anent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.48 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing near the top part of the wall on one facing and tensile fracture on the other facing at the same location. Figure 4.52 shows view of panel W9 before testing, while Figs. 4.56 and 4.57 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local

41

dm1 1age and deforn1atio n in the OSB facing . Figure 4.54 dep icts the load-ax ial shortenin g
relationship for the model. It \Vas observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing occurred on one side of the panel near its top quarter point, associated with diagonal tensile fracture of the foam at the same location as shown in Fig. 4.56, as well as at the connection with the top wall stud as shown in Fig. 4.57.

Figures 4.44, 4.49, and 4.55 depict the jacking load-lateral deflection relationships for walls W7, W8 and W9, respectively. It can be observed that lateral deflection increase with increase in the applied load. This may be attributed to the lateral unstability of the OSB facings as a result of the high flexibility of the foan1 in between. However lateral deflection is not considered in this study as design criteria per AC04. Table 4.1 shows that the experimental ultimate jacking load was 199.58, 172.36 and 268.23 kN for walls W7, W8 and W9, respectively. As per AC-04, the ultimate factored design axial resisting compressive load is the experimental ultimate load divided by 2.5. Thus, the factored design axial resisting load is 79.83, 68.94 and 107.29 kN for walls W7, W8 and W9, respectively. Since the obtained design values of two of the walls are more than 15% difference with the average value of the three panels, the design factored axial compressive load for Group A is 68.94 kN, as the least value of the three. Also, Table 4.1 shows that the jacking loads at 1/8" axial shortening were 91.72, 59.91 and 92.94 kN for walls W7, W8 and W9, respectively. Since the obtained design values of two of the walls are more than 15% difference with the average value of the three panels, the design factored axial compressive load per on the deflection criteria for Group Cis 59.91 kN, as the least value of the three. To meet both the strength and deflection criteria, the factored resisting compressive load would be 59.91 kN for Group C. Comparing results for Group A with zero eccentricity and

42

Gro up C \Vi th t/6 eccentric ity, it cnn be observed that the design res istjng axial forces deceased
by 52%.

4.6 Group D In this group, three identical panels were tested to complete collapse under uniformly distributed axial concentric compression load. Each panel was of 10 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick, with foam-spline connection. Figure 4.57 shows view of panel WI 0 before testing, while Figs. 4.60 through 4.62 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation. It was observed that the failure mode in wall Wl 0 was due to OSB facing crushing near the bottom end of wall on one facing in addition to OSB crushing along its connection with the bottom wall studs that led to global permanent lateral defonnation of the panel as shown in Fig. 4.60. It should be noted that diagonal tensile fracture in the foam was observed at the same location of OSB failure as shown in Fig. 4.61. The failure was abrupt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-axial shortening relationship in Fig. 4.58. It was observed that linear elastic behaviour was maintained till failure.

Figure 4.63 shows view of panel Wll before testing, while Figs. 4.66 and 4.67 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.64 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode of Wall Wl2 was identical to model WIO. Figure 4.68 shows view of panel Wl2 before testing, while Figs. 4.71 and 4.72 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views

43

of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.69 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode was similar to that for Wall wlO expect that foam-OSB delamination occurred at the bottom of the wall, as shown in Fig. 4. 72. Figures 4.59, 4.65, and 4.70 depict the jacking load-lateral deflection relationships for walls WlO, W11 and W12, respectively. It can be observed that lateral deflection increase with increase in the applied load. This may be attributed to the lateral unstability of the OSB facings as a result of the high flexibility of the foam in between. However lateral deflection is not considered in this study as design criteria per AC04. Table 4.1 shows that the experimental ultimate jacking load was 221.70, 215.56 and 186.19 kN for walls W10, W11 and W12, respectively. As per AC-04, the ulti1nate factored design axial resisting compressive load is the experimental ultitnate load divided by 2.5. Thus, the factored design axial resisting load is 88.68, 86.22 and 74.48 kN for walls WlO, W11 and W12, respectively. Since the obtained design value for each wall is within 15% difference with the average value of the three panels, the design factored axial compressive load for Group Dis 83.13 kN. This value will be farther be used to exan1ine the axial force-moment interaction for this wall group.

4.7 GroupE
In this group, three identical panels were tested to complete collapse under unifonnly distributed axial concentric compression load. Each panel was of 12 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick, with foam-spline connection. Figure 4.73 shows view of panel W13 before testing, while Figs. 4.76 through 4.78 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation. It was observed that the failure mode in wall W13 was due to OSB facing crushing near and at the top part of the \vall
44

panel in additi on to foan1-0S B splitting as shown in Fi g. 4.77. The failure \vas abrupt causin g a
sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-axial shortening relationship in Fig. 4.74. It was observed that linear elastic behaviour was maintained till failure.

Figure 4.79 shows view of panel W14 before testing, while Figs. 4.82 through 4.84 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.80 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the n1odel. It was observed that the failure mode was similar to that for wall W13 but at the bottom end of the wall. Figure 4.85 shows view of panel W15 before testing, while Figs. 4.88 through 4. 91 show views of the pem1anent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.86 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the n1odel. It was observed that the failure mode of wall W15 was similar to that for wall W14. Figures 4. 75, 4.81, and 4.87 depict the jacking load-lateral deflection relationships for walls Wl3, W14 and Wl5, respectively. It can be observed that lateral deflection increase with increase in the applied load. This may be attributed to the lateral unstability of the OSB facings as a result of the high flexibility of the foam in between. However lateral deflection is not considered in this study as design criteria per AC04. Table 4.1 shows that the experimental ultimate jacking load was 259.35,217.34 and 218.30 kN for walls W13, W14 and W15, respectively. As per AC-04, the ultimate factored design axial resisting compressive load is the experimental ultimate load divided by 2.5. Thus, the factored ·design axial resisting load is 103.74, 86.94 and 87.32 kN for walls W13, W14 and W15, respectively. Since the obtained design values for each walls is within 15% difference with the average value of the three panels, the design factored axial compressive load for Group E is

45

92.66. kN. This ·value \vill be farther be used to exan1ine the axial force-moment interaction for
this wall group.

4.8 Group F

In this group, three identical panels were tested to complete collapse under uniformly distributed axial concentric compression load. Each panel was of 16 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick, with
foam~spline

connection. Figure 4.92 shows view of panel Wl6 before

testing, while Figs. 4.94 and 4.95 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation. It was observed that the failure mode in wall W16 was due to OSB facing crushing near the top quarter point on one side of the panel and tensile fracture on the OSB on the other side of the wall at the same location. Diagonal tensile fracture in the foam between the top quarter point and the top end of the wall was observed as
~hown

in Fig. 4.95. It should be noted that local OSB crushing along its

connection with the top wall stud was observed. Figure 4.96 shows view of panel W17 before testing, while Figs. 4.99 through 4.101 show views of the perni.anent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.97 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing between the mid-height and bottom quarter point of the wall, associated with OSB:-foam splitting and diagonal tensile fracture on the foam as shown in Fig. 4.99. Figure 4.102 shows view of panel W18 before testing, while Figs. 4.105 through 4.107 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of the local damage and deformation in the OSB facing. Figure 4.103 depicts the load-axial shortening relationship for the model. It was observed that the failure mode of OSB crushing

46

occurred ot1 one sjde of the panel near its bottom end as Yve ll as at OSB connection 'lvith the
bottom wall stud. This led to foam-OSB splitting on one side of the wall at the failure location as shown in Fig. 4.1 06.

Figures 4.93, 4.98, and 4.104 depict the jacking load-lateral deflection relationships for walls W16, W17 and W18, respectively. It can be observed that lateral deflection increase with increase in the applied load. This may be attributed to the lateral unstability of the OSB facings as a result of the high flexibility of the foam in between. However lateral deflection is not considered in this study as design criteria per AC04. Table 4.1 shows that the experimental ultimate jacking load was 209.64, 145.14 and 119.91 kN for walls W16, W17 and W18, respectively. As per AC-04, the ultimate factored design axial resisting cmnpressive load is the experimental ultin1ate load divided by 2.5. Thus, the factored design axial resisting load is 83.86, 58.06 and 4 7. 97 kN for walls W 16, W 17 and W18, respectively. Since the obtained design values for walls are more 15% difference with the average value of the three panels, the design factored axial compressive load for Group F is 47.97 kN, as the least one of the three values. This value will be farther be used to examine the axial force-mon1ent interaction for this wall group.

4.9 Group G In this group, as two panels have been added two the originally three panels, five identical panels were tested to complete collapse under flexure load. Each panel was of 9 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick. The thickness of the sheathing (OSB) is 7/16 inch for each of the two sides facings. Figure 4.108 shows view of panel WS 19 before testing, while Fig. 4.110 sho\vs view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure. The failure n1ode
47

was due to horizontal shear t:1i lure at the interface between the foam and top OSB facing . The failure was between the top surface of the foam and the adhesive over a panel length between the support and the quarter-point line, causing top foam-OSB delamination (de bonding) over the supports. Shear failure was sudden causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-deflection history shown in Fig. 4.109. Figure 4.111 and 4.112 shows a close-up view of this type of failure. It has been noted that noise was heard when approaching failure load and the shear failure was abrupt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-deflection results shown in Figure 4.109. It was observed that the LVDT readings at each side of the panel correlate well. It was observed that linear elastic behaviour was maintained at the live load level (i.e. serviceability limit state) and even at the design factored load level (i.e. ultimate limit state). Sin1ilar behavior of WS 19 was observed for walls WS20 through WS23 of the san1e size. Figures 4.113, 4.118, 4.123 show view of panel WS20, WS21, and WS22, respectively, before testing. Figures 4.115 through 4.117 show views of the pennanent deformed shape of the panel after failure and close-up views of the OSB-foam splitting, While Fig. 4.114 depicts the jacking load-deflection relationship for wall WS20. Figures 4.120 through 4.122 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure and close-up views of the OSB-foam splitting, While Fig. 4.119 depicts the jacking load-deflection relationship for wall WS21. Figures 4.125 through 4.127 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure and close-up views of the OSB-foam splitting, While Fig. 4.124 depicts the jacking loaddeflection relationship for wall WS22. Figures 4.129 through 4.131 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure and close-up views of the OSB-foam splitting, While Fig. 4.128 depicts the jacking load-deflection relationship for wall WS23.

48

Table 4.2 shows a smnmary of panel configurations along \Yith the ultimate jacking load
for Group G. It can be observed that the ultimate jacking load was 27.22, 27.77, 24.99, 28.77 and 26.77 kN for panels WS 19, WS20, WS21, WS22 and WS23, respectively. Conservatively, the jacking load did not include the weight of the loading system of 2 kN. It is worth mentioning that the ultimate jacking load for each panel is within 15% difference from the average jacking load of the three panels. Thus, the design ultimate jacking load is taken as the average experimental ultimate jacking load divided by a factor of safety of 3 (i.e. 27.10 I 3 = 9.03 kN). This makes the design ultimate bending moment resistance as 2.93 kN.m for 1.2 m panel width.

4.10 Group H In this group, three identical panels were tested to complete collapse under flexure load. Each panel was a foam-spline-connected walls with 12 feet height, 4 feet wide and 6.5 inch thick. The thickness of the sheathing (OSB) is 7116 inch for each of the two sides facings. Figure 4.132 shows view of panel WS24 before testing, while Fig. 4.134 shows view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure. The failure was due to diagonal shear crack at approximately mid-length between the support and the quarter point, continued with delamination between OSB facings and the foam core towards support as well as the quarter point. Shear failure was sudden causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-deflection history. Figures 4.135 and 4.136 show a close-up view of this type of failure.

It has been noted that noise was heard when approaching failure load and the shear failure was
abrupt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-deflection results shown in Figure 4.133. Similar behavior of WS24 was observed for walls WS25 through WS26 of the same size. Figures 4.137 and 4.142 show view of panel WS25, and WS26, respectively,

49

before testin g. Figures 4.139 through 4.144 show vie\VS of the permanent deformed shape of the
panel after failure and close-up views of the OSB-foam splitting, While Figs. 4.13 8 and 4.143 depict the jacking load-deflection relationship for walls WS25 and WS26, respectively. Figures 4.140 and 4.141 show views of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure and close-up views of the OSB-foam splitting. Figures 4.145 through 4.146 show close-up views of the OSB-foam splitting at the support locations.

Table 4.2 shows a sun1mary of panel configurations along with the ultimate jacking load for walls Group H. It can be observed that the ultimate jacking load was 26.99, 28.55 and 27.99 kN for panels WS24, WS25 and WS26, respectively. Conservatively, the jacking lo'ad did not include the weight of the loading system of 2 kN. It is worth mentioning that the ultin1ate jacking load for each panel is within 15% difference fron1 the average jacking load of the three panels. Thus, the design ultimate jacking load is taken as the average experimental ultin1ate jacking load divided by a factor of safety of 3 (i.e. 27.84 I 3
=

9.28 kN). This makes the design ultimate

bending moment resistance as 4.07 kN.m for 1.2 m panel width.

4.11 Group I
In this group, three identical panels were tested to complete collapse under uniformly distributed axial concentric compression load. Each panel was lumber-spline-connected foundation wall with 9 feet height, 4 feet wide and 8.25 inch thick. The interior facing was made of OSB sheet with 7/16 inch thickness, while the exterior facing was made of 5/8" thick pressure-treated plywood. Figure 4.147 shows view of wall panel W27 before testing, while Figs. 4.149 through 4.151 shows view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure

50

as well as close-up vie\VS of local fai lure in the fac in gs. I \Vas observed that the fa ilure mode the panels of group I, was due to plywood crushing near and at the top end of the wall. It should be noted that noise was heard when approaching failure load and the failure was abrupt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-lateral deflection results shown in Fig. 4.148.

Figure 4.152 shows view of wall panel W28 before testing, while Figs. 4.155 and 4.156 shows view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of local failure in the facings. I was observed that the failure mode wall W28 was due to plywood as well as OSB crushing at the bottom end of the wall. It should be noted that noise was heard when approaching failure load and the failure was abn1pt causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-axial shortening relationship shown in Fig. 4.153. Figure 4.154 shows view of the jacking load-lateral deflection relationship of wall .W28. Figure 4.157 shows view of wall panel W29 before testing, while Figs. 4.160, 4.161 and 4.162 shows view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure as well as close-up views of local failure in the facings. I was observed that the failure mode wall W29 included crushing of plywood facing at the bottom end of the wall as shown in Fig. 4.160 and crushing of OSB facing at the top quarter point and near the top of the wall as shown in Figs. 4.161 and 4.162, respectively . It should be noted that noise was heard when approaching failure and the failure was abrupt. Figures 4.158 and 4.159 depict the load-axial shortening relationship and the loadlateral deflection relationship for wall W29. Table 4.3 shows a summary of panel configurations along with the ultimate jacking load for walls Group I. It can be observed that the ultimate jacking load was 355.81, 317.94 and

51

408. 26 kN for panels \V2 7, \V28 and \V29, re spective ly. It is worth men tioning that the ul timate
jacking load for each panel is within 15% difference from the averagejacking load of the three panels. Thus, the design ultimate jacking load is taken as the average experimental ultimate jacking load divided by a factor of safety of2.5 (i.e.144.23 kN as shown in Table 4.3).

4.12 Group J

In this group, three identical panels similar to the wall foundation in Group I were tested to complete collapse under flexure load. Figure 4.163 shows view of panel WS30 before testing, while Fig. 4 .164 shows view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure . The failure was due to diagonal shear crack at the support as shown in Fig. 4.166. Shear failure was sudden· causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-deflection history shown in Fig. 4.165. Figure 4.167 shows view of panel WS31 before testing, while Fig. 4.168 shows view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure. The failure was due to horizontal shear failure between the foam and the top plywood facing at the support ad shown in Figs. 4.170 and 4.171. Shear failure was sudden causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-deflection history shown in Fig. 4.169. Figure 4.172 shows view of panel WS32 before testing, while Fig. 4.173 shows view of the permanent deformed shape of the panel after failure. The failure was due to diagonal shear crack in the foam between the support and the quarter point on one free edge of the panel as shown in Fig. 4.175 and due to horizontal shear between the plywood top facing and the foam on the other free edge of the panel as shown in Fig. 4.176. Shear failure was sudden causing a sudden drop in the applied jacking load as depicted in the load-deflection history shown in Fig. 4.174.

Tab le 4.4 sho\VS a sun11 nary of panel co nfigu rations along with the ultimate jacking load for panel Group J. It can be observed that the ultimate jacking load was 51.54, 49.77 and 51.10

kN for panels WS30, WS31 and WS32, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the ultimate
jacking load for each panel is within 15% difference from the average jacking load of the three panels. Thus, the design ultimate jacking load is taken as the average experimental ultin1ate jacking load divided by a factor of safety of 3 (i.e. 50.80 I 3
=

16.93 kN). This makes the design

ultimate bending moment resistance as 5.48 kN.m for 1.2 m panel width.

4.13 Design Table for SIP wall under axial compressive load
As shown in Table 4.1, Wall Group C is the only group that was tested under t/6 eccentricity. As such, manual calculations were performed to detern1ine the n1aximum served joist span by the wall. As mentioned earlier, the design factored axial c01npressive load obtained experimentally was 59.91 kN. By dividing this load over 1.2 m width of the tested wall, the factored uniform load over the wall would be 49.93 kN. Three building configurations are considered herein, namely: (i) a wall carrying single flat roof, (ii) a wall carrying a flat roof and a floor; and (iii) a wall carrying a flat roof and two floors. For the first case, the factored combined load would be 1.25D and 1.5S, where D and S are dead load and snow load on the roof, respectively. Assuming that D is 0.5 k.Pa for the roof and 0.4 kPa for the wall, the served joist span is calculated as 22.9, 16.9, 13.4, 11.1 and 9.5 m for specified snow load of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 kPa. Results are listed in Table 4.5. In case of a wall carrying a roof and a floor, two load combinations were considered as follows: Case (1 ): 1.25D +0.5S for the roof and 1.25D + 1.5L for the floor, where L is the floor live load. Case (2): 1.25D +1.5S for the roof and 1.25D + 0.5L for the floor, where L is the floor live load.

53

Considerin g the flo or live load in reside nti al construc ti on as 1.9 kPa, the served span fo r th e firs t
and second load combination cases are 10.3, 9.72, 9.3, 8.8 and 8.43 for case (1) and 12.75, 10.6, 9.1, 7.9 and 7.0 for case (2). The smaller served span for each snow load is then listed in Table 4.5. Similar procedure was performed for the wall case carrying a roof and two floors, leading to served joist spans of 5.7, 5.5, 5.3, 5.2, and 5.0 m for snow loads of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 kPa, respectively. Final results are reported in Table 4.5.

Where Pr = factored compressive axial load; Pr = factored compressive load resistance; Mr = factored bending moment, taking into account end m01nents and atnplified moments due to axial loads in laterally loaded members; Mr = factored bending moment resistance.

Table 4.6 provides the factored compressive axial resisting load and factored resisting moment as obtained experimentally for the 9', 10' and 12'

For a specified wind load in a

given area in Canada, the factored applied axial compressive load can be then obtained from equation 4.1, from which the maximum roof or floor joist span served by this wall can be easily obtained. Special attention must be given to the effects of the following on the interaction equation:

For a specified soil pressure of 4.7 kPa, the factored applied axial compressive load can be then obtained from equation 4.2, from which the maximum floor joist span served by this wall can be easily obtained. Special attention 1nust be given to the effects of the following on the interaction equation: · When the compressive axial load is not applied in the centre of the vertical axis of the wall, the eccentricity will create a bending moment on the column.

CONCLUSIONS
5.1 General
A literature review was conducted in order to establish the foundation of the research program which includes an extensive experimental program to investigate the static structural behavior of insulated sandwich timber panels under axial concentric loading and axial eccentric loading. The experimental program included testing to-collapse 32 actual-size timber panels according to the ASTM standards. The structural adequacy of the tested sandwich panels for possible use in residential construction was presented, based on an assessment for the experimental results with respect to code requirements for ultimate and serviceability limit states design of such panels.

5.2 CONCLUSIONS
Based on the experimental findings, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1- The dominant failure mode in panels with foam-spline connection under axial concentric or eccentric uniform load is due to crushing of the panel facing at two main locations that let to lateral permanent defonnation of the wall panel after failure. These locations are (i) the connection between the OSB or plywood facings with the top or bottom stud plates; (ii) the quarter point area of the wall height. In some failure cases, shear debonding between the foam and OSB facing was observed. Moreover, some panels exhibited diagonal crack in the foam associated with OSB crushing.

56

2- Pan el Groups A <1 nd 8 showed that th e prese nce of lumber- sp lin e co nnec ti on mth er th an the foa mspline connection has insignificant effect of the structural response and the load carrying capacity of the wall panels. 3- The dominant failure mode in panels under flexural load is due to the horizontal shear failure at one of the two areas of the panel end-quarters. When the panel span increases, The diagonal shear failure, at one of the two areas of the panel end-quariers, started to be the dominant failure mode. 4- Based on the data generated from testing panel group C of 9'x4'x6 ~" size, a design table was developed to provide designers with the maximum served joist span when this wall size is used in residential building. Three types of building sizes were considered, namely: (i) wall supporting single roof, (ii) wall supporting a roof and a floor; and (iii) wall supporting a roof and two floors. 5- Similar design information was established for walls subjected to both axial compressive loading and wind loading as well as basement walls subjected to both axial compressive loading and soil pressure. 6- Testing of preserved SIPs for basement foundation showed that failure always occur at the junction between the plywood facing and the wall end that had the single timber plate with one row of nails rather than the end that had two timber plates with two rows of nails. Thus, it is recommended to use two timber plates with two rows of nails at each wall end to better transfer the axial compressive force in the facing to the end plates. This modification would certainly increase the load carrying capacity of the basement wall.

5.3 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
1- Study the ultimate capacity and serviceability of SIPs under impact loading. 2- Develop empirical expressions for the ultimate load carrying capacity for various SIP sizes based on finite-element modeling for the tested panels. 3- Study the structural response of SIPs under racking loading.

57

4- Study the flexural creep response of basement wal ls made of SIPs under sustained so il pressure.
