Abstract
This project introduces new analyses of the impacts of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) in traffic assignment models which are not widely available in the literature, as well as

to reveal how stable the effects are in diverse models. A comprehensive review of the literature is conducted to provide an overview of MAUP, including the scale and zonal effect, as well as its
recent applications in travel demand modelling and other subject areas. Particular scrutiny is

made towards inappropriate methods of MAUP-analysis in travel demand models. The scale effect is tested in traffic assignment models using associated zone structures of the Greater Montreal Area (GMA), a unique geographic region involving island regions and water bodies.

Introduction

The modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) has been a topic of interest in the field of transportation for the past few decades. Much of the transportation-related MAUP research pays particular attention to determining appropriate structure of traffic analysis zones (TAZs) for
improved travel demand forecasting purposes.

As a general topic, the MAUP "has recently roared back to the forefront of spatial analysis" (Miller, 1999, p.375). Although this is a somewhat unfamiliar subject area for transportation

analysts (Paez and Scott, 2004), researchers have been able to conclude effects of the MAUP on both the statistical results and other network performance measures associated with travel
demand forecasts by aggregating or disaggregating zones of a particular analysis region.

For travel demand forecasting purposes, understanding the impact of the MAUP is very crucial

to achieving more accurate trip forecasts.

Travel demand forecasts are conducted in a spatial

manner (i.e. in the form of TAZs), so investigating the MAUP impacts on various zone structures can also lead researchers to determining the most suitable zone structure for analysis purposes.

At present, two concepts of the MAUP are well known. The scale effect of the MAUP occurs

when a set of zones are aggregated or disaggregated into a different number of zones with different sizes and shapes, thus resulting in different numerical outputs. The zonal effect of the MAUP is a result of zonal aggregation to the same scale, but with different sized and shaped
zones.

Few publications, both on the MAUP in general and in transportation-related MAUP analysis, discuss the zonal effect of the MAUP, while many focus on the scale effect. As has been found in the general literature, transportation-related MAUP research has continued to reaffirm the
presence of the scale effect as a result of various zonal aggregations and disaggregations.

Over the years, specific rules to zone delineation have been established in the literature which,

for the most part, have been followed when conducting MAUP-related research. It is unfortunate
1

that, given the extremely limited literature exists on the impacts of the MAUP on the mode split stage of the Urban Transportation Planning Process (UTPP), the one study that has focussed on this stage applied an arbitrary zone system in the analysis.

This project attempts to fill some gaps on MAUP-related travel demand forecasting research.

Specifically, this project will reinforce how to test for zonal effect of the MAUP in a mode split
model for the Greater Montreal Area (GMA) while taking into account appropriate rules for TAZ design. The main and unique component of this project features the performance of multiple

traffic assignments using two zone systems designed for the GMA (GMA) in Quebec, Canada, testing for the scale effect of the MAUP. In both cases, the purpose of the research is to prove that there is a significant difference in statistical outputs between zone systems of different
scales.

The second chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature with an overview on:
· The evolution of the MAUP, with case studies primarily referenced from studies on jurisdictions in the United States of America (herein referred to as the U.S.);

·

The impact on the MAUP as presented in research on the latter three stages of the UTTP:
trip distribution, mode split and traffic assignment;

·

The general rules developed over time for the delineation of TAZs;

· ·

The presence of scale effect in traffic assignment exercises; and The presence of zonal effect in a mode split exercise.

The third chapter describes the results of testing the MAUP in a mode split model. The research methodology and study area will be introduced in the fourth chapter with an overview of the GMA model, along with the study results of MAUP testing in a traffic assignment exercise. A
summary of conclusions and research contributions are reported in the final chapter.

Literature Review

This literature review is divided into five subsections.

The first subsection describes the

evolution of the MAUP as it is known under present standards. The second subsection discusses the relevant literature pertaining to rules of zone delineation, with particular respect to TAZs.
The third subsection provides an overview of applicable research on scale effect, with a

particular focus on travel demand models.

The fourth subsection provides a review of the

limited research conducted on the zonal effect. A summary of the literature review is provided
in the fifth subsection.

2.1.0 The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem Defined and Applied

The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) has been a topic of discussion since the early 1930s. Although not formally defined as MAUP until the late 1970s, the concepts were well established in studies of geographic units and the impact of their modification.
studies, however, focused on the result of changing scale.

The earliest

2.1.1 The Effect of Spatial Aggregation - Pre-1970s

Prior to the 1970s, the MAUP had not been formally defined. However, much work had been
conducted on the impact of spatial aggregation in spatial analysis, all of which proved their associated impacts on statistical outputs (Gehkle and Biehl, 1934; Robinson, 1950; Blalock,

1964). Over time, definitions related to the MAUP were developed and taken into consideration
as more recent publications on the topic became available (Yule and Kendall, 1950; Sawicki,
1973).

The earliest publications on spatial aggregation were provided by Gehkle and Biehl (1934) and

Robinson (1950).

The two demonstrated the effect of aggregating geographic units in their

respective analyses of correlation coefficients -- a standard index used to measure the level of
3

linear correlation between two different variables of analysis.

In an analysis of correlation

between male juvenile delinquency and median equivalent monthly rental in Cleveland, Ohio, Gehlke and Biehl (1934) aggregated 252 census tracts into seven sets of larger zones - of equal
size in each case, and subsequently reported higher values for the correlation coefficients as the

size of the zone increased (-0.763 at the most aggregate scale, and -0.502 at the most disaggregate scale). Similar results were concluded by Robinson (1950) in an analysis of

ecological correlations between black populations and illiterate populations across the United
States, where the resulting coefficient differed at each level of aggregation (0.203 at the individual level, 0.773 at U.S. state-level, and 0.946 under a structure of nine geographic divisions defined by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1930).

In the same year that Robinson (1950) added to the discoveries of Gehlke and Biehl (1934), Yule and Kendall (1950) introduced the concept of modifiable unit - a geographic unit that can be

divided or united with another geographic unit for enhanced analysis.

In their analysis of

correlation between yields of wheat and potatoes in England, spatial aggregation was necessary

in some cases in order to give the analysis meaning due to the physical inability or impracticality of growing two distinct crop types on the same harvesting ground. They thus aggregated 48

geographic units to 24, which ultimately affected the correlation coefficient (from 0.2189 to 0.2963). The same procedure was repeated for a grouping of 12 zones, again resulting in a

higher correlation coefficient value (0.5757).

Blalock (1964) continued the trend of correlation analysis, but took a slightly different approach. In a study based in the southern U.S., the percentage of non-white population in the southern U.S. was regressed against the income difference between whites and blacks in the respective jurisdiction. In this instance, the interest was geared towards the impact of different methods of
zonal aggregation. A set of 150 counties was aggregated into zonal systems with 75, 30, 15 and 10 zones respectively using four different aggregation methods - random aggregation, grouping by the independent variable (percentage of non-white population), grouping by the dependent

variable (income difference between whites and blacks), and geographical proximity. While it was expected that the resulting coefficients would differ between scales (see Table 1), it was
interesting to see how some variance existed between zonal structures at the exact same scale.

Sawicki (1973) introduced the concept of aggregation bias, noting that "one should be wary of using high correlation coefficients resulting from correlations with large units of analysis"

(p. 110), and that only the appropriate scale of analysis would reveal appropriate results.

In a

case study of social disorganization in Syracuse, New York, he was able to use individual-level

data from surveys to test for heterogeneity of societal elements at three zonal levels - census
tracts (most aggregate level), neighbourhoods, and "police beats" (most disaggregate level).

2.1.2 Verging on the Definition of the MAUP - Post 1970s

The most noteworthy sources on the topic of MAUP were introduced in the late 1970s and early
1980s by Openshaw (1977; 1984; 1989) and colleagues. Openshaw (1977) introduced the

concept of scale effect, which related to the work of Yule and Kendall (1950), Blalock (1964) and Sawicki (1973), as well as the zoning effect, which related more towards the extended

research of Blalock (1964). The impact of the scale problem was further demonstrated through

an analysis of 1,219 grids at 100 square metres, which were then aggregated into grids of 200m2,

300m2, 400m2, 500m2, 600m2, 700m2, 800m2, 900m2, and lkm2.

To demonstrate the
A linear

aggregation problem, a series of alternate aggregations were used at each scale.1

correlation analysis on the number of early-Victorian homes and mid-Victorian homes within

each grid was performed in each zone system. Similar to previous studies, most of the resulting
values of product moment correlation (r) increased at each level of aggregation, which

demonstrated the scale problem.

To test for the aggregation problem, the mean value and

standard deviation of the product moment correlation was calculated, and the reported results of these outputs differed by scale. Openshaw (1977) noted that "it has not been possible to consider the full extent of the aggregation problem, as this would involve an examination of every
possible zonal configuration of boundaries for each integer of zones between 2 and 1,218"
(p.460).

1 Openshaw (1977) only made mention of the 25 different aggregations at the 500m2 scale.
5

In a separate publication, Openshaw (1984) provided detailed definitions of the scale problem

and aggregation problem.

The scale problem was defined as "the variation in results that can

often be obtained when data for one set of areal units are progressively aggregated into fewer and
larger units for analysis" (Openshaw, 1984, p.8). The aggregation problem was defined as "any variation in results due to the use of alternative units of analysis when the number of units is held
constant" (Openshaw, 1984, p.8).

Openshaw (1989) further elaborated on the importance of investigating the aggregation problem

as a result of the availability of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which allows the user to go beyond defined number of areal units of investigation. It was mentioned that there was no

technology available at the time to produce the most optimal aggregated zone system,
particularly since the zone system is meant to react with a particular model or method of analysis being used. The example of intrazonal trips in a travel demand forecasting model - those trips

that are not detected in a zone system because they do not cross zonal boundaries from one zone
to another -- was specifically cited to explain this theory. By changing the boundaries of the zone system, the output model and goodness of fit can be manipulated to better represent the spatial

interaction of trip.

However, Openshaw (1989) cautioned that randomly generated (or

aggregated) zone systems can have limited application to real-life examples depending on units of analysis as well as the manner of aggregating the zone system.

2.2.0 Zone Delineation

As previously elaborated by Openshaw (1989), zones should be delineated based on a series of

specified constraints, and not randomly.

"The imposition of TAZ homogeneity for a specific

variable (e.g. car ownership) and the number of zones established can have a deep impact in the

modeling results, making the use of one specific data sample unfeasible in some studies"
(Martinez et al., 2007, p.59), so constraint aggregation must be done carefully.

2.2.1 Rules for Designing TAZs

One of the original publications specific to TAZ design came from Baass (1981), who set out a
series of guidelines for appropriate TAZ design.

"These criteria are based on quantitative and qualitative data of such a multitude and
diversity that the human mind alone will not be able to process. These criteria can be stated in the following way: 1. Achieve a maximum of homogeneity inside the newly created zones, which is importantfor the trip generation and the modal split phase of the model sequence; 2. Retain a maximum of interaction between newly established zones or a minimum of intrazonal trips, which is an important requirement for the trip distribution and trip
assignment models;

3.

Limit the number of trip ends for the newly created spatial entity in order to avoid overloading ofthe adjacent street network in the assignment phase;

4.

Respect physical, political, and historical boundaries as far as they are of importance
from a planning point ofview;

5. 6. 7.

Avoid undesirable shapes ofnewly created zones; Group only adjacent basic spatial units: Generate only connected zones;

8.

Avoid the formation of islands, which means zones that are completely contained in another zone:

9.

Obtain a zonal system in which the number of households, population, area, or trips generated and attracted are nearly equal in each zone (the variation with respect to one of these variables should be kept as small as possible); and

10. Base the delineation ofthe zonal boundaries on the census boundaries. "
(Baass, 1981, p. 1)

In a recent study by Spurr (2005) on performing traffic assignment in a digital GIS-based model, four principle zone delineation criteria based on rules established by Bennion and O'Neill (1994), Ortuzar and Willumson (1994) and Caliper Corporation (2005) were applied, which stated that:

1.

The system must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In other words, the zones
must not overlap and must entirely cover the area under study.

2.

The system must respect the boundaries of existing census tracts.

While the zones must be small enough to

(Spurr, 2005, p.28).

2.2.2 Other Forms of Zone Design

Contrary to random zone design, zone boundaries for certain applications can be a result of manual design in order to accommodate organizational needs, such as jurisdictional boundaries,

physical boundaries such as rivers, or transportation corridors for government analysis (O'Neill,
j

1991; Ding, 1994; Cockings and Martin, 2004). On the other hand, grid systems are a form of arbitrary user-defined set of zones, as applied in a mode split analysis by Zhang and Kukudia
(2005) (see Chapter 5.2).

In a non-TDM, but transportation-related study, Martinez et al. (2007) investigated the presence
of scale effect between a local governmental TAZ system, an arbitrary grid system, and a new user-defined TAZ system. After developing measures for statistical precision, geographical

precision, and information loss between the three systems, they found that their grids produced
better results than the existing TAZs, but that the newly delineated TAZs with more natural boundaries with additional constraints performed better than the grids.

2.3.0 Scale Effect of the MAUP

Numerous publications have concluded that the adjustment of the scale of areal units will impact

the resulting statistics. Of particular interest are the few publications that exist on the analysis on MAUP specific to the classic four-stage UTPP - namely the trip distribution stage (Batty and Sikdar, 1982), the mode split stage (Zhang and Kukudia, 2005), and the traffic assignment stage (Crevo, 1991; Ding, 1998; Khatib et al.; 2001, Binetti and Ciani, 2002; Chang et al., 2002). This

chapter will reveal the results of these publications that studied the MAUP specifically within the
realm of the UTPP.

2.3.1 Trip Distribution and Scale Effect

Batty and Sikdar (1982) reviewed the earliest study on scale effect in gravity modeling - namely

in trip distribution.

This study initially reviewed the distribution of trips from the Reading,
The test for scale effect

England region in 1966 using 22 aggregations of a 23-zone system.

involved the solving for the scale and dispersion parameters developed in the unconstrained,
origin-constrained, destination-constrained, and doubly constrained. The cost friction coefficient (Q was maintained at the level of the 23 zones for the reason "that dimensional consistency must be retained by the aggregation process, and that the twenty-three-zone level estimate of C is the most accurate available" (Batty and Sikdar, 1982, p.641). The observed results were graphed The observed

against the predicted results under each model, revealing a linear relationship.

results and predicted results were then each respectively graphed against the level of spatial aggregation, showing a downward slope - "that is, the informations increase in value as levels of greater aggregation are produced" (Batty and Sikdar, 1982, p.643). However, a goodness of fit

performance (measured as r2) was then determined for each model, and revealed that the model
fit was highest at a higher level of aggregation. Furthermore, the r2 outputs yielded acceptable
results for the doubly- and origin-constrained models (0.9697 and 0.8269 respectively at the disaggregate level and 1.0 and 0.9907 respectively at the aggregate level), and poor results for the unconstrained model (0.0384 at the disaggregate level and 0.2679 at the aggregate level).

2.3.2 Traffic Assignment and Scale Effect

One of the first publications on traffic assignment performance in reconfigured TAZs came from
Crevo (1991). In most cases, equilibrium assignment was used (Ding, 1994; Ding 1998; Khatib

et al, 2001; Chang et al, 2002; Binneti and Ciani, 20022). This simple analysis of scale effect
two zone systems did not reveal much evidence of the scale effect. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, additional scale effect studies in traffic assignment were produced with more complex analyses and more than two zone systems. Ding (1998), Khatib et al. (2001), Binetti and Ciani
(2002) and Chang et al. (2002) designed a test of the MAUP in their respective traffic

assignment models using diverse parameters for traffic network performance.

These latter

authors concluded the presence of scale effect in traffic assignment, as demonstrated by the
different resulting network performance criteria values at each scale.

Crevo's (19-91) study involved the analysis of how to account for population and land use
changes over time through the reconfiguration of TAZs. Using the 204 zone system of New

Castle County provided by the Delaware Department of Transportation, "candidate zones" were

identified for analysis based on growth level between 1970 and 1985 of land use and population as well as associated impact on travel compared to other TAZs. Such criteria included household and employment characteristics trip productions and attractions, the relationship of the total trip

ends to the geographic area of the TAZ3. Once this was completed, the selected (ten) TAZs were
further analyzed for geographical coverage, and one additional zone was removed from analysis since it mostly covered a land mass without any population or imposed land use. With the nine remaining TAZs, a process of zone subdivision was applied whereby 6,000-8,000 trip ends warranted a new TAZ (down from an average 11,000 trip ends in the original TAZ format). This
resulted in the creation of 23 new TAZs.

Using traffic volumes from 1985 provided by the Delaware Department of Transportation, a
traffic assignment exercise was performed on both the original TAZ system and the new TAZ

system.

Using total trips, trip hours, average trip length (in minutes), and total number of

3 This was measured by calculating the ratio of the total trip ends to the total number of acres making up the TAZ.

intrazonal trips as the travel characteristic criteria, the differences between the zone systems were
very minor (Crevo, 1991). Other statistical correlation comparisons and traffic assignment

comparisons concluded a similar lack of variation between TAZ systems.

Horner M. W., & Murray (2004) provided an appropriate scrutiny of this publication, stating that "one could argue that perhaps an insufficient number of tests were conducted by Crevo (1991) to
conclude any general relationship, as considering a larger set of zones or choosing an alternative

representation of demand could have produced alternative findings, at least in the context of traffic assignment" (p.787). However, the fact that only a portion of the entire geographic area was investigated, whereas most scale effect studies review the impacts within the full geography incorporated in a given zone system.

A unique nation-wide analysis conducted in South Korea using multiple zone systems was

reported in Ding (1994) and Ding (1998).

Using a TAZ design algorithm that maximised for

criteria such as homogeneity, interzonal trips, and compatibility with existing census boundaries,

the 130 zone TAZ system was aggregated to seven different scales of 100, 75, 50, 35, 25, 15 and
8 zones respectively. Ding (1998) reported issues not addressed by the TAZ design algorithm, such as some incompatibility between the census boundaries and the new TAZ delineations.

1991 demographic and traffic data was used in an equilibrium traffic assignment. Ding (1994)
acknowledged the use of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) exponent for the time parameter in
the equilibrium assignment, the use of 0.01 as the closure criterion for achieving equilibrium,

and the application of a maximum of 25 iterations in the assignment. The network performance

criteria included a ratio of interzonal trips to total trips, a congestion index output from the
TRANSPLAN software (not defined in either publication), assigned and unassigned interzonal

trips4, intrazonal trips, total trips, total vehicle miles, total vehicle hours, and average speed.
Ding (1998) reported that, while there was no impact on total trips between scales, the total vehicle miles travelled increased by nearly 49% from the most aggregate scale to the most disaggregate scale, while the total vehicle hours increased by 31% respectively. Oddly enough, the (undefined) congestion index yields less congested conditions in the 130 TAZ scale

In all TAZ systems, there was no case of unassigned interzonal trips.

assignment.

Overall, the effect of adjusting for scale in TAZ was demonstrated in traffic

A study based in the U.S. state of Idaho was published in Khatib et al. (2001) and Chang et al. (2002). In both publications, it was reported that 11 zone systems were created based on the

existing census geographies of counties (44 zones), census tracts (269 zones) and census blocks
(1,122 zones). While only three different scales were used, each scale was assigned a unique

centroid weighted by a different parameter. Four zone systems were created for each level of
census geography except for census blocks where only three zone systems were created, where

the only difference was the type of centroids used in each zone system: the geometric (physical)
centre within the zone, the (largest) city within a zone, centroids weighted by population, and

centroids weighted by household-density6.

Khatib et al. (2001) performed a full four-stage

model using socioeconomic data from the 1990 U.S. Census for the trip generation step and
traffic data from 1996 provided by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) for the traffic

assignment.

The network performance criteria used in the traffic assignment included trip length (in minutes), number of assigned interzonal trips, a ratio of the estimated volume to the recorded average annual daily traffic count (AADT) from the ITD, and percent root-mean square error (RMSE%) an index that measures the variance between the observed and forecasted traffic volumes.
Khatib et al. (2001) also tested for correlation using Pearson product moment correlation

coefficient (R). A series of analyses of variance (ANOVA) and a Fisher test of least significant difference (LSD) were performed on each zone structure to check the variance of resulting
coefficients and other mathematical results between zone systems.

5 These particular results were not reported in great detail in either publication. 6 The census-block level zones did not have a zone system with household-density-weighted centroids. While
Chang et al. (2002) it was not explained why, the author believes that the size of the census blocks may have made it impossible to weight centroids according to household-density.

The resulting traffic assignment outputs suggested the presence of the scale effect, as they
differed at each scale. Chang et al. (2002) noted specifically that trip length by type varied

between zone systems by an average of+/- 16 minutes around the mean value, with the census

blocks yielding many shorter trip lengths7. The number of interzonal trips was less on the most
aggregate scale (counties) and greater on the most disaggregate scale (census blocks). The estimated volume to AADT ratios performed better at the census block-level except in the case

of urban minor arterials where this variable performed better at the census tract-level. The root
mean square error statistic also yielded lower results for the census blocks. The ANOVA and

LSD results suggested that the root mean square error value was not the same among all 11 zone systems, and that resulting mean values at each scale of zone systems were significantly different
from each other.

Binneti and Ciani's (2002) study involved the design of 10 TAZ systems for the City of Bari, Italy - with 10 zones being the most aggregate scale and 75 zones being the most disaggregate.
After constructing the 1475 link street network using GIS, a Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) traffic assignment was performed using the results of a trip generation, trip distribution and mode split model. Using total cost (hours), average cost (seconds), average cost (seconds when the path cost vector is equal to zero), number of saturated links, and a poorly defined congestion

index8 as the network performance criteria, scale effect was demonstrated by the diverse results
ranging +/- 20% around the mean value of the results.

2.4.0 Zonal Effect of the MAUP

Limited research exists demonstrating the zonal effect of MAUP. The most notable studies on
zonal effect come from Blalock (1964), who authored one of the original studies on zonal effect,
as well as Fotheringham and Wong (1991), Amrhein and Reynolds (1996) and Hunt and Boots

(1996) who performed a test of zonal effect alongside their respective analyses of scale effect.

Chang el al. (2002) also reported that the shorter trip lengths may have also been a result of the derived centroids, where many of the trips would be geographically concentrated within the zones. congestion index without ever defining the value of Ic in the publication.

8 Binetti and Ciani (2002) produced an equation ofIc = X; [(Gsfi)/Yfi] as a means of defining the so called "PCP"
13

To date, the only paper that deals specifically with the zonal effect in the classic four-stage
UTTP comes from Zhang and Kukudia (2005).

2,4.1 Miscellaneous Studies in Zonal Effect

Fotheringham and Wong (1991) created 20 separate zone systems for each level of aggregation of the Buffalo Metropolitan Area block level zones (871): census tracts (278); and random
aggregations of 800, 400, 200, 100, 50 and 25 zones. When regressing mean family income

(dollars) to the respective percentages of the population that were homeowners, blue-collar workers, black, and over the age of 65, they discovered that the coefficients differed not only between scales, but approximately 121 estimates per parameter as a result of the different zonal configurations at the same scale. The same occurred in a logistic regression test correlating the

proportion of owner-occupied homes to blue-collard workers, mean family income (tens of thousands of dollars) and median house value (hundreds of thousands of dollars). To further

demonstrate the zonal effect, they aggregated the block level zonal system of 871 into 150 sets of
a 218 zone system. The dependent variable (percentage of owners) in all 150 zone systems was

significantly positive from zero, and an average range of income increasing by $1000-2000 was
output for each 0.1 unit of population owning a home. Amrhein and Reynolds (1996) also tested for zonal effect using multiple zoning systems at different scales. Their case study of Lancashire County in England contained census geography comprising of 3048 enumeration areas (EAs), 304 wards, and 14 districts. It was decided that,

due to lack of appropriate data, the EA level zones would not be used. Thus, the 304 wards were aggregated to zone systems of 137, 122, 106, 91, 76, 61, 46, 30 and 14 zones respectively, each

weighted according to a percentage of the population within each ward divisible by 5.9 Each
level of aggregation was given 100 alternate zone systems with different boundaries. Using

1991 census data for the region, the mean of total households with dependents, the mean ratio of
female-headed households with dependents to all families with dependents, and their associated variance expected variance were calculated in each scale. While the scale effect was determined

9 The 137 zones contained 45% of the ward population, 122 zones contained 40%, and so on.
14

with this method due to the differences in the output variance values at each scale, the zonal effect was inconclusive, as the mean values were the same at each scale.

Hunt and Boots (1996) tested three datasets for multicolinearity on 4 levels of aggregation each containing 30 different zone systems. Two of the datasets were arbitrary with 240 grid-style

spatial units, while the third featured 231 EAs of the urban area of the Saskatoon census
metropolitan area (CMA) from 1986. Using factor analysis - a means to check for variance

between spatial data containing random variables, scale effect and zoning effect was examined

by reviewing mean values of individual characteristics for change between scale and zone
structure. It was determined that zoning effect was more predominant in this exercise than scale effect, particularly in data free of spatial autocorrelation - the correlation between a variable and
its reference point in space.

Hunt and Boots (1996) also calibrated a multinomial logit model exploring the probability of a given travel mode for home-based work trips and home-based-non-work trips from each of the
zone systems. Each of the output coefficients for the explanatory variables used in the logit

models was diverse among the eight zone systems. With respect to zonal effect, this was also the case between the three pairs of "comparable" zone systems.

2.4.2 Zonal Effect in Mode Split Models

Zhang and Kukudia (2005) conducted one of the only analyses on zonal effect related to the classic four-stage modelling process in the Boston Metropolitan Area. The study was originally designed to test for scale effect in mode split models using U.S. census data from 1990 and Trip Diary Survey data from 1991 in eight different zone systems - five arbitrary grid systems containing block sizes of 1/16, lA, lA, 1, and 2 square miles respectively, and three zone systems based existing census geography (census block, block group and TAZ). Zonal effect was

investigated by testing the differences between the most comparable pair of zone systems based
on zone size (measured in acres) - namely the /4-mile grids with the census blocks, the 1-mile

grids with block groups, and the 2-mile grids with the TAZs. Using a multimomial logit model,
15

the probability of a given travel mode for home-based work trips and home-based-non-work trips for each of the zone systems was calibrated. From a scale effect perspective, the eight zone

systems yielded diverse coefficients for the explanatory variables used in the logit models. From a zonal effect perspective, these coefficients also differed within the classified pairs of zone
systems.

Zhang and Kukudia (2005) suggested that that their "grid approach to aggregating data
produce(d) more tractable and stable results than the approach with statistical areal units (e.g., TAZ and [block group])" (p.78). However, this application was inappropriate as it did not

conform to the topology (especially with the presence of small islands, where two islands can be covered by a single grid depending on the specified area). They were wise to test other types of zonal delineations, thus avoiding the scrutiny of Openshaw (1977), as well as ensuring that their

zones were homogenous in size based on user-specifications, in conformance to rules on TAZ
design. However, "the most important criteria for good aggregated zoning systems in

transportation planning are the achievement of homogeneity of population inside the new zones
and the conservation of the interaction between zones" (Baass, 1981, p.3). By artificially

aggregating zones based on a specified area measurement, some of the new zones are subject to
containing a population zero, which can have a tremendous impact on the modelling and resulting statistical outputs.

2.5.0 Summary

The MAUP is not a new concept by any means - including in travel demand models. The effect

of spatial aggregation and areal unit boundary changes has been proven in various studies using
statistical analysis. The concepts have been well defined over time, and have since been

incorporated in subsequent studies, many of which will be reviewed in later sections of this project.

The application of zone design rules to new zone systems, such as outlined by Baass (1981), can improve the output modelling when compared to the use of arbitrary zone systems.
16

This was

demonstrated by Martinez et al. (2007) who applied specific constraints to their newly designed
TAZ system and thus improved their modelling results.

The existence of the scale effect of the MAUP in travel demand forecasting has a fair amount of exposure in the research - namely in the traffic assignment stage. All of these traffic assignment publications analyzed the impact of scale effect. Ding (1994), Homer and Murray (2002),

Binetti and Ciani (2002) used various goodness of fit tests and other significance tests to conclude that aggregate zone structures yield less accurate and significant results than

disaggregate zone structures.

The main advantage of disaggregate zone systems in traffic

assignment is the reduction of intrazonal trips, with minor exceptions (Khatib et al., 2001; Chang

et al., 2002). There has yet to be a publication that reviews the presence of zonal effect in traffic
assignment models. It is clear that this shortcoming needs to be addressed.

Each of the studies on zonal effect also featured a scale effect analysis.

The majority of the

studies contained multiple zone systems at the same scale for improved analysis of zone effect.

The one study that investigated the zonal effect in travel demand forecasting disregarded a key rule of TAZ design, thus deeming the analysis inappropriate. A new study on zonal effect in
travel demand forecasting is needed that takes the TAZ design rules into account.

17

3.0

Testing the MAUP in a Mode Split Model

A procedure to test the MAUP more appropriately in a mode split model for the Greater Montreal Area (GMA) by taking into account the rules for TAZ design, as highlighted in Nix (2008). The full details of this experiment are detailed in this chapter. This procedure utilized

demographic data from the 2001 census for the GMA.

While census data in Canada is

conducted every 5 years by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2007), there was insufficient demographic data from the 2006 census at the time of the authoring of this project.

Like many of the publications that investigated the zonal effect, this study also tested for scale
effect. In both cases, the following utility model was used in the form of binary logit:

where: P = the probability of choosing alternative n; n = mode of transportation (in this case, transit);
e = exponential function (or 2.718281828)

U=utility of alternative n = a + PkXk;
a = coefficient of the dependent variable (constant);

p = coefficient of the independent variable; x = independent variables; k -- number of independent variables

The following independent variables were used in the initial models:

population density [popdens] - defined as every 10,000 persons per square kilometre; renting population [rent_%] - defined as the ratio of rented dwellings to total occupied dwellings;

household size [hshldsize] - defined as the average number of persons per household);
households with children [hshldchild] - defined as the ratio of census families with children (including single parents) to total households;
18

· ·

average income of population 15 years and over (measured in $ 10,000s) [inc!5+avg]; distance to Central Business District [distCBD] - defined as distance from the centroid

(or geographic midpoint) of each analysis zone to the centroid of the zone classified as
the CBD, measured in kilometres.

It was expected that more public transit commuting would take place from zones with a higher
population density and proportion of renters. There is a general understanding that public transit

services work best, and are thus more accessible, in higher density neighbourhoods (Cervero and
Gorham, 1995; Kenworthy and Laube, 1996; Cervero and Kockelman, 1997). Renting

demographic can often be correlated with the inability to afford a private automobile for commuting purposes, which results in a higher dependency on public transit (Ruby et al., 2004).

As a contrast, it was anticipated that less commuting made by public transit would occur from

zones with a large proportion of multiple-member households, households with children and higher average income, and those that were located further away from the CBD. The size of the household has been found be an influential factor in auto ownership (Kockelman, as cited in Holtzclaw et al., 2002). Higher income is generally associated with a higher probability of
Trips involving children and their caregivers

vehicle ownership (Pucher and Renne, 2003).

travelling together tend to involve trip-chains that may be too complex to accommodate by transit, such as dropping off the child(ren) to a daycare facility prior to going to the place of
employment (Turner and Grieco, 2000; Jang, 2003; McGuckin et al., 2005; Lee and McNally,

2006).

Due to the higher densities in a typical CBD of a major city, public transit service is

usually more readily available and accessible in the CBD compared to its suburban counterparts,
(Chamey, 2005; Alshalalfah and Shalaby, 2007).

As per other researchers involved in MAUP research (Batty and Sikdar, 1982; Khatib et al.,

2001), fit and significance of each model was explored through explanatory variables such as r3

and adjusted r3 (where a higher value represents a better fit), dependent and independent
variables coefficients, and the student t-test (where the variable is significant when t < -1.65 or >
1.65).

19

3.1

Testing for Scale Effect in a Mode Split Model

To establish the presence of scale effect, two predetermined census zone formats were used to
contain the census data: census tracts (CTs) - the larger, more aggregate agglomerations containing 939 zones (see Figure 1); and dissemination areas (DAs) - smaller disaggregate agglomerations containing 5,996 zones (see Figure 2). A census tract is defined by Statistics

Canada as a small geographical unit containing a population of 2,500-8,000 and located in an
urban centre with a population of at least 50,000 (Statistics Canada [2], 2009), a smaller unit with a population of 400-700 is referred to as a dissemination area (Statistics Canada [3], 2009).

The goodness of fit tests from initial binary logit models in both the CT and DA structures can be

found in Figure 3. As demonstrated by the output values of r2 and adjusted r2, by running the
model with all of the variables at once, the fit of the models between the dependent and independent variables was quite good.

The coefficients as shown in Figure 4 reinforced the expectation that population density and renting population would have a positive impact on transit ridership while average income and
distance away from the CBD would have the opposite impact. It was surprising to see that larger

households and households with children had a positive impact on transit trips, although a further review of the literature led to a study that reported similar findings (see Kim and Kim, 2004).
However, almost all of the variables used in the logit model for the CT structure were

insignificant as demonstrated by the t-tests, while the DA structure also had many insignificant
variables.

Figure 4 - Coefficients and t-tests for Preliminary Model

From the MAUP perspective. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that scale effect existed between the two census agglomeration structures. The goodness of fit differed between the two scales, as

demonstrated by the respective r2 values. There were also more insignificant variables in the
CT structure compared to those in DA format, as demonstrated by the student-t tests. In

order to analyze the impact of the two spatial structures on the dependent and independent
variables in more detail, a correlation matrix for the CT structure (Figure 5) and DA structure (Figure 6) was created and reviewed. Significant observations included the fact that transit

mode split was heavily correlated with population density and household size in the CT structure, but not in the DA structure. Similar observations were found between population

density and household size, between population density and distance from the CBD, and between household size and distance from the CBD. This is a further demonstration of the scale effect, as

there is more correlation in the more aggregate structure than the disaggregate structure.

Figure 7 - Descriptive Statistics in CT and DA Structure

Due to their similarities between census agglomeration structures, it was decided that the second set of logit models would feature transit mode split as the dependent variable, and distance from CBD, households with children and average income as the independent variables. While it was recognized that $500 worth in average income is a significant difference as an output statistic when dealing with a region with a population of approximately 3.5 million as of 2001, it was anticipated that this difference would not severely impact the modeling. With less correlation

between variables, the previous hypothesis tests for any remaining variables applied.

As was found in the initial models, the fit between the dependent and independent variables was

quite good, despite the different values of r2 between the two scales (see Figure 8). Although
fewer independent variables were used in this case, the output coefficients still forced a null
hypothesis acceptance on the impact of households with children on transit trips, while all other
23

outputs supported the hypothesis (see Figure 9).

Aside from the constant, all variables were

determined significant by the t-test in both structures, with the exception of households with children which was only found to be significant at the DA level. The level of significance also
differed greatly between census agglomeration structures, as suggested by the t-tests.

Testing for Zonal Effect in a Mode Split Model

Due to the limited research available on this topic, an analysis of zonal effect was also carried

out. This was done by creating two aggregate zone structures that avoided arbitrary delineation (such as the application of a grid structure) with improved population homogeneity distribution
between zones. Based on the 2001 GMA census population of 3.42 million, 850 zones were

aggregated from the DA level for both zone systems in order to comply with the average population distribution in the census tract form of 4,031. The expectation was that aggregation

bias would remain the same, as would be supported by two unique spatial delineations, thus leading to the discovery of how different spatial delineations result in different statistical
representation.

A regional portioning feature was used to create the two new zone structures.

Horn (1995)

describes the process of generating seed-zones randomly though the specified number of clusters per structure (in this case 850) with a uniform distribution across the land-mass of the analysis
24

region (the GMA). This process also allowed the exclusion of water bodies, which would not contain population. The results of this process were two zone structures herein referred to as

Alternative Zone System 1 (Figure 10) and Alternative Zone System 2 (see Figure 11).

Figure 10 - Greater Montreal Area Alternative Zone System 1

Using the same dependent and independent variables with associated hypoproject tests from the
revised scale effect models, a binary logit model was run in each of the two new zone structures. Many of the resulting outputs were similar to the revised model of the CT structure. As

expected, the two new aggregate zone structures yielded higher goodness of fit results (see

Figure 12), with a difference in r2 value between the two zone structures by 0.01.

The output model supported the hypothesis that all independent variables (except for households with children) impact transit trip production. Both zone structures yielded significant student-t tests for the independent variables of average income and distance to CBD only, as was the case

for the revised CT model (see Figure 9). Minor differences in coefficient values and student-t outputs resulted for all variables in both models (see Figure 13). Like in the scale effect

analysis, the coefficients as well as the student t-tests for the constant were also diverse among the two zone structures.

Summary

This section revealed the results of MAUP-related analysis that determined the presence of scale effect and zonal effect between two zonal structures in a stage of the travel demand forecasting
process that is rarely covered in the literature. In the case of scale effect, the more aggregate the scale, the better the fit of the model, as has been previously demonstrated by Batty and Sikdar

(1982). However, aggregate structures tend to yield less significant and therefore less accurate independent variable coefficients compared to disaggregate scales (Ding, 1994; Ding, 1998;
Homer and Murray, 2002; Binetti and Ciani, 2002).

Project Methodology

For this project, a comparison of traffic assignment outputs was conducted between two TAZ
systems - an aggregate model developed for analysis purposes in a previous study (Spurr, 2005),

and a disaggregate model currently in use for a local jurisdiction. The goal of this comparison was to reinforce previous findings from other MAUP-related studies on traffic assignment:

1. 2.

That traffic assignment outputs change between TAZ-level aggregations; That the number of intrazonal trips reduces in an disaggregate TAZ system; and

3.

That disaggregate TAZ systems yield more statistically significant results that those of
aggregate TAZ systems.

None of the authors cited in the literature review describe which form equilibrium assignment is
used in their traffic assignment model (Crevo, 1991; Ding, 1994; Ding, 1998; Khatib et al., 2001; Chang et al., 2002), except for Binetti and Ciani (2002) who performed a SUE assignment model. It is safe to assume that "equilibrium assignment" is a looser term representing User

Equilibrium (UE) assignment, and is thus the popular choice algorithm for use in a traffic assignment exercise. However, it is important to distinguish between the two forms of

equilibrium traffic assignments.

UE assignment achieves convergence through a series of iterations, and adopts Wardrop's first
principle that one cannot save time by using an alternate route, assuming that there is perfect
knowledge of the traffic network (Caliper Corporation, 2005). SUE assignment, on the other

hand assumes imperfect knowledge by the travellers of the attributes of the traffic networks, and that they may have a different perceptions of travel costs, and has the ability to produce more accurate results since it has the ability to assign limited flow on less attractive routes, unlike UE assignment which assigns zero flow on such links (Caliper Corporation, 2005).

28

4.0.1 The Study Area

The study area chosen for this research is the Greater Montreal Area (GMA).

Located in the

southwest part of the Province of Quebec, the GMA serves as an opportune area to research based on its physical and census geography - an area consisting of two large islands and many

small islands, as well as a population of 3.6 million as of the 2006 census (Statistics Canada,
2009 [1]). A thorough review of the literature suggested that the use of such geography for a

MAUP-related analysis has not previously been used, as previous studies generally used a singleisland or mainland region without a series of water bodies dividing the census geography.

4.0.2 The Network

Much of the work on the traffic network used for this study came from Spurr (2005), who conducted an analysis of performing traffic assignment in a traffic network created in GIS. Using a street network file developed by DMTI Spatial Ltd., as well as a skeletal EMME/2 network provided by the Ministere des transports de Quebec (MTQ) for cross-comparison where
appropriate, a total of 133,998 one- or two-way links were coded in TransCAD, the GIS software
with a travel demand forecasting interface.

A series of specifications based on observations of true characteristics and patterns in the field,
such as lane configuration, posted travel speed or turn bans (particularly for u-turns), were used
to allow the network to represent true capacity and other existing conditions (or network segment costs) on the real traffic network as much as possible, contrary to a typical skeleton network

featuring only freeways and major arterial roads.

For modelling purposes, the links were all

coded to Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) volume-delay function standards, meaning that the
corresponding values of alpha (a) and beta (ft) parameters were 0.6 and 2 respectively. Routes not associated with the traffic network, such as pedestrian and bicycle trails, as well as ferry routes, were specially coded so as not to be included when running the shortest-path algorithm. Two centroid connectors per zone were delineated and specially designed to not connect with

inappropriate links, such as freeways and freeway ramps, or any of the links previously
29

mentioned that were to be discarded from the shortest path analysis, and were further refined after the connection to the network to ensure logical delineation.

4.0.3 The Origin-Destination Matrices

Three origin-destination matrices were created from the origin-destination survey data provided by the AMT - the regional transportation authority for the GMA. Each of the three matrices was created to reflect the three hours within the morning peak-period - 6:00-6:59 AM, 7:00-7:59
AM, and 8:00-8:59 AM.

4.1.0 Zone System 1 - Spurr

Spurr (2005) created a zonal system using the census metropolitan area (CMA) census

geographies of Montreal, Saint-Jean-Iberville and Salaberry-de-Valleyfield for 1996 using the four principle zone delineation criteria based on rules established by Bennion and O'Neill
(1994), Ortuzar and Willumson (1994) and Caliper Corporation (2005). The application of the

first criterion explains the addition of the two non-Montreal CMAs to the study area. These were included due to an abundance of trips originating and destined outside of the Montreal CMA as per the origin-destination survey provided by the Agence Metropolitaine de Transport (AMT), the local regional transportation authority. This process resulted in the creation of 873 zones.

Spurr (2005) expressed problems with the original TAZ delineation with regards to the number
of trip attractions. 8,935 was the mean number of trip attractions per zone yielded under the 873
zone configuration, with a standard deviation of 7,039 trip attractions. Meanwhile, one zone

yielded 55,718 trip attractions, which was recorded as being greater than six standard deviations from the average, yielding problematic issues for a traffic assignment representing real conditions. With the TAZ representative of the Central Business District (CBD) containing an

area of 0.82 square kilometers due to the lack of residential distribution, causing all CBD bound trips to be attracted to a single centroid. This was also problematic for zones with major
30

shopping malls, office towers and other large institutions such as universities and colleges. Spurr (2005) thus applied a clustering method to account for these problems. By converting the x-y

coordinates of the trip destinations into a point file, these trip destinations could be clustered into groupings based on their spatial distribution, and new zones were created based on the userspecification of 939 zones.

4.1.1 Traffic Assignment 1 - Spurr

Using the User-Equilibrium traffic assignment algorithm, specifying a 1% convergence criterion,
three traffic assignments were run based on the three peak periods. As Spurr (2005) notes, the peak hour with the lowest demand did not require the least number of iterations to converge
compared to the peak hour with higher interzonal demand, which suggests the impact of

intrazonal trips.

The maximum number of iterations required for convergence was 12 (see

To validate the output from the traffic assignment model, Spurr (2005) used field observations

provided by the MTQ for 197 observation points. The field flows were cross-referenced against
the output flows from the traffic assignments using the following equation:

%RMSE=

100

where:

xj= the forecast flow atj

yj= the observed flow atj
n = the number of observations

For optimal performance of this equation, the resulting output should less than 30 according to the U.S. Department of Transportation (Transportation Model Improvement Program, 2001, in
Spurr, 2005). In addition, the correlation between the field flows and the forecasted flows was

measured using a linear regression model, where an overall output r2 of 0.88 was recommended
by the U.S. Department of Transportation (Transportation Model Improvement Program, 2001,
in Spurr, 2005). The results of this exercise are shown in Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16.

4.2.0 Zone System 2 - MTQ

A dissagregate TAZ system provided by the MTQ was used to as the comparison TAZ system to that of Spurr. The MTQ system contained 1,496 zones, of which the majority of the smaller

zones located on the Island of Montreal, and on the fringes of the shoreline suburbs off the coast
of the Island of Montreal.

4.2.1 Traffic Assignment 2 - Nix

A UE assignment was performed twice per peak hour to check for the different outputs between equilibrium assignments - one using the default alpha and beta parameters provided in TransCAD of 0.15 and 4 respectively, and the other using the alpha and beta parameters of 0.6 and 2 respectively as defined by Spurr (2005). As in both Spurr (2005) and in Ding (1994 and
1998), a convergence criterion of 1% was applied, with a maximum of 25 iterations.

For this exercise, the traffic assignment results provided by Spurr (2005) were compared with

results from a different zone system of 1,496 zones provided by the MTQ using the same traffic
demand and street file. Since similar problems with the automated centroid connector feature

arose as outlined in Spurr (2005), each zone was reviewed to ensure that the centroid connectors
did not cross zonal boundaries, or did not connect an island centroid to a mainland street.

In the case of centroid connectors crossing zonal boundaries, 32 zonal centroid connectors were modified to maintain them within their respective zone, ensuring that they did not connect to endpoints that were also connected to freeways, pedestrian-only paths, transit-only corridors, ferry routes, ferry ramps and highway ramps. In addition, modifications were made in larger

suburban zones using enhanced point of interest (EPOI) file provided by DMTI Spatial Inc., in
order to allow for major trip generators such as large shopping malls, hospitals and post

secondary institutions to serve as the appropriate centroid for the zone where activity was not so
diverse, such as the CBD. To summarize, any EPOI representing a large hospital, a college

d'enseignement general et professionnel (College of General and Vocational Education CEGEP), a university, or a department store such as Holt Renfrew, La Bale, Les Ailes de la

Mode, Sears, Simons, Wal-Mart or Zellers was considered the major trip generator in most
zones. In a unique case where a combination of these establishments existed in the same zone,

the retail store would be considered the more valid major trip generator of the zone since the traffic assignment outputs were exclusively for auto-oriented traffic, followed by a postsecondary institution. In certain cases, the author's previous knowledge of the area would

override the EPOI data (for example: in Sallabery-de-Valleyfield, there was no EPOI data for a

34

Wal-Mart on Boulevard Monseigneur Langlois).
relocated to reflect true traffic conditions.

In total, 52 zones' centroid connectors were

4.3.0 Traffic Assignment Results Comparison

A quick comparison of the various outputs between simulations can reveal the impact of the MAUP in the Montreal traffic assignment. Compared to the model performed by Spurr (2005),
the traffic assignments required more iterations to converge (see Figure 17, Figure 18 and Figure 19), however the maximum flow change in all simulations with the MTQ zone system
was lower than that of Spurr (2005).

The intrazonal demand was also approximately 3% higher in each of the disaggregate models compared to Spurr's model. Other noticeable differences in values were trip speeds and trip time

in minutes, while trip lengths showed marginal differences. This contradicted the hypothesis, as
supported by Ding (1998), Khatib et al. (2001) and Chang et al. (2002), particularly with respect to the intrazonal demand. Although differences occurred between TAZ outputs, they yielded

opposite results than what was predicted.

A key assumption that can be made regarding the results from these simulations is the detailed delineation difference between TAZ systems. Since the boundaries of the aggregate zones are

not necessarily pure amalgamations of the smaller zones found in the MTQ TAZ system, intrazonal demand can increase from the aggregate TAZ system to the disaggregate system

purely based upon the location of the geocoded trips used in the model. For example, it was found that the Sallabery-de-Valleyfield zone was delineated differently in the MTQ system than
that of Spurr (2005) - Spurr's TAZ system had this region delineated as three zones. A series of
37

follow-up simulations were performed to investigate a possible modelling error. As the results in

the follow-up simulations were the same, a thorough investigation of the origin-destination matrices was conducted. It was found that demand was inflated in the Sallabery-de-Valleyfield
zone, which may have led to the overall increase in trip parameters in the disaggregate zone
system. However, time did not permit to rectify the problem, as it was unknown how to do so in a timely manner.

4.3.1 Model Performance by Link

As was done by Spurr (2005), a comparison of model forecasts to actual flows recorded in the

field was conducted based on available count-station data from the MTQ.

Since Spurr (2005)

only provided detail for the 21 bridges, the freeways were not included in this analysis so as to
conduct a comparative analysis for model performance between the aggregate and disaggregate
models.

Figure 20 shows the results of the network performance analysis for the 6:00-6:59 peak hour. The first peak hour yielded an approximate 7 percent over-forecast for one-directional flow
inbound to Montreal, and an approximate 35% under-forecast in outbound flows from the island,

both of which are higher than the results reported in Spurr (2005). The number of bridge links that fell within the acceptable target forecast range was found to be the same in both models. One noticeable change between models was the regional forecasts, where close-to-accurate forecasting reduced for inbound flows and increased for outbound flows in the MTQ model.

The results of the network performance analysis for the 7:00-7:59 peak hour can be found in
Figure 21. As was found in Spurr (2005), the network performance changed significantly - in

this case to an approximate 7% under-forecast for inbound flows and an approximate The first peak hour yielded an approximate 3 percent over-forecast for one-directional flow inbound to
Montreal, and an approximate 20% under-forecast in outbound flows from the island. These

results are also quite different from the results of Spurr (2005), who reported over-forecasts for
both directions. The number of regional forecasts falling within the acceptable target range was

The 8:00-8:59 peak hour results can be found in Figure 22. Whereas the network performance
in Spurr (2005) was near accurate for both inbound and outbound flows, the MTQ model under-

Figure 23 - Bridge performance for the Entire AM peak (0600-0859)

model which over-forecast inbound flows and under-forecast outbound flows by approximately
7% respectively. The number of acceptable forecasted link flows between models is quite

comparable at the individual link level, with nine acceptable inbound link flows in the MTQ model and six acceptable inbound link flows in the Spurr model, with two acceptable outbound

link flows in both models. However, at the regional level, the number of acceptable links in the
MTQ model remains the same, while the number of acceptable inbound link flows in the Spurr model drops to only one.
42

As was found in Section 4.3.0, there were significant differences in outputs between the two
models. This, unfortunately, may still be skewed by the modelling error found through the

inflated demand in the western suburban region of the GMA. Nevertheless, there are reportable differences between the two sets of outputs, which support the general understanding of the
MAUP.

4.3.2 Statistical Significance of Different Model Outputs by Link

As was done by Khatib et al. (2001), Chang et al. (2002), the impact of the MAUP in traffic

assignment was further explored by investigating statistical significance of the model output
differences - in this case through the application of a t-test. To perform this analysis, the mean values of one-way flows on the 21 bridges in the GMA were calculated for the Spurr model and the disaggregate model using the Spurr Alpha-Beta parameters with new centroid connectors,
which was the selected as the most appropriate comparison model to that of Spurr given the similar parameters and centroid connectors.

The results in Figure 24 shows that the average one-directional flows were higher in the aggregate Spurr model compared to the disaggregate model created in this study. In this case, the t-test suggested that the difference in output for average travel speed between the Spurr and

disaggregate model for the three peak hours was significant.

As was reported in previous

sections, the significant difference may be skewed by the modeling error discussed in Section
4.3.0. However, based on the general understanding of the impact of the MAUP, these

significant differences are noteworthy to report.

Figure 24 - Statistical Significance Testing for One-Directional Flows

4.4.0 Summary

The results in this study did not completely support the research hypotheses.

While traffic

assignment outputs between TAZ-level aggregations were noticeably different, as evidenced in

the outputs for speed, v/c ratios and distance travelled, these outputs increased through TAZ disaggregation, rather than increased as has been previously found in the literature. The number of intrazonal trips increased in the disaggregate TAZ system rather than decreased. All of this was the result of a modelling error caused by inflated demand in the origin-destination matrix,
which time did not allow for rectification.

There were significant differences found when one-directional flows were compared between the

aggregate and disaggregate models. This was further supported by a t-test to suggest that there was a statistically significant difference in one-directional flows between the disaggregate MTQ
TAZ system and that the aggregate Spurr TAZ system, despite the potential modelling error.

Conclusions

With the increasing attention on the MAUP in spatial analysis research, its impact on travel

demand forecasts is equally important to understand, especially when attempting to develop the ideal TAZ structure for a transportation planning region, whether in a metropolitan region as was investigated in this study and many others, or a larger regional scale such as an island nation.

While the impact of scale effect was the primary focus of this research, limited research on the zonal effect was also highlighted in this study. This study reaffirmed previous findings on scale
effect impact, while enhancing findings on zonal effect by using appropriate rules for TAZ
delineation.

The results of this study contribute to the literature in various ways. Firstly, it thoroughly links

the available literature on the MAUP and its impact on travel demand models. Secondly, it fills a major gap in the literature on zonal effect in travel demand models by introducing a more
appropriate method of conducting such in the mode split stage by taking into account the rules of zone delineation. Finally, it introduces a test of the scale effect in a traffic assignment model in a Canadian jurisdiction - one with island regions and water bodies, creating a complex
environment for traffic zones and their respective delineations.
