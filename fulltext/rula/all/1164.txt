Abstract
Background: Epidemiological studies show a high incidence of falls and demonstrate that they cause serious consequences to individual health and quality of life, as well as significant social and healthcare impacts. The literature shows that poor balance is a n1ajor cause of f(:llls, and emphasizes the need for valid and effective balance diagnostics and risk assessment of falls and balance in1pairments. The literature review also indicates that arm moven1ents have a potentially significant effect on balance. Objectives: Since existing balance diagnostics usually require complex measurement and specialized labs, this study proposes a set of accelerotneter~based tests of dynamic postural balance. The first objective of this study is to develop and evaluate novel accelerometer-based methods for balance and arm m.ovement diagnostics. The second objective is to explore the impact of arm n1ovements on the 1naintenance balance, and investigate the functions of the dominant and non-dominant arn1s during dynamic balance. Methods: The study applies a set of new, instrumented, accelerometer-based balance tests to tneasure postural balance, trunk (center of mass - CoM), and arn1 movements during dynamic balancing tasks. The balance evaluation consists of a set of standard balance tests and new instrumented balance board tests. This study explores the in1pact of ann movements on postural balance and CoM dynamics, as well as the specific arm movetnent strategies during the balancing tasks. Results: The findings suggest that arn1s play an important role in the improvement of balance. The results provide evidence that arm use during the performance of balance tests significantly alters the trunk dynan1ics (CoM). Arm moven1ents are associated with the increased magnitude of trunk movements that are required for adjusting the centre of mass to the base of support. Overall, the arm movements in1prove mobility, lateral balance, and contribute to prevention of falls. The results support the model of dynamic arm dominance, suggesting the specific role of the don1inant and non-dmninant arms. In sun1mary, the most prevalent arm strategy, contributing to better balance performance was shown to be the active, counterbalancing and coordinated arm moven1ents strategy. Conclusions: This study shows that the proposed accelerometer~based tests provide useful diagnostic information for postural balance and ann movements evaluation. These devices provide valuable diagnostics information, data for progress 1nonitoring during balance training, and consequently enhance risk assessment and falls prevention. Finally, the study shows the in1portant impact of arm movements on dynamic balance and provides an insight into dynamics of the arm movements and balance maintenance.

Arm Movements and Dynamic Postural Stability: Accelerometer-based Balance Tests

1. Introduction
In this study, I evaluate a set of accelerometer-based tests of dynamic postural balance, and examine the roles of ann Inovetnents for its maintenance during balancing tasks. The first chapter consists of a literature review that details the incidence, consequences and causes of falls; The objectives of the study are defined to explore the apparent knowledge gaps related to arm movements and the roles of dominant and non-dominant arms in posture and balance. The second chapter explains the methodology for the design and development of the ·instrun1ented balance assessment for the classic and novel balance tests used · in my study. This chapter describes the study's instruments, data acquisition, signal procession and statistical data analysis. The results obtained through this study are presented in Chapter Three in the following sections. The first section includes the results on the classic balance tests and compares the performance obtained with restricted and free arm movements. The second section presents the association between results on classic and accelerometer-based tests obtained with limited and free arm movements by evaluating the n1agnitude of accelerations of the centre of mass .(CoM) during balancing tasks, then cmnparing them to the standard outcome tneasures. The last section includes an analysis of arm movements during maintenance of postural balance. Arm movements are analyzed during stable and balance recovery tasks. This chapter also examines handedness, and the role that dominant and non-dominant arms play in balance maintenance. A discussion of the results and the relevance of this study for balance diagnostics and assessment is presented in Chapter Four. The fifth chapter contains an explanation of the study's lin1itations, as well as suggestions for future studies in this domain.

1.1 Literature Review
A review of the literature reveals a significant number of studies that provide evidence of the high incidence and serious consequences of falls. Many epidemiological studies (e.g. Rubenstein, 2006; Maki, 2003) suggest that falls are the most frequent cause of injuries in the general population. It has been documented that in the United States, falls result in some 300,000 hip fractures per year, with associated health care costs of US$1 0 billion; this is expected to increase four titnes over the next 40 years (Maki, 2003; Hayes et al., 1996). Fear of falling has been linked with social withdrawal, inactivity, and decreased n1obility in seniors and is the cause of about 40% of nursing home admissions (Maki, 2003; Tinetti & Williams, 1997). The main issue in falls prevention is the high frequency and severity of falls among the elderly. Pal1icularly among the ageing baby-boomer population, the effects of falls represent a significant financial burden on the healthcare system, and, as such, require extensive research. Numerous epidemiological studies have provided evidence of the high incidence and significant consequences of falls on health-related quality of life, and on their social impacts (Maki, et al. 2003; Rubenstein, 2006; Rubenstein & Josephson, 2006; Hayes et al., 1997; Tinetti & Williams, 1997). Analysis of comparable data from the Canadian
Con~munity

Health Survey (CCHS)

indicates similar tendencies. Our analysis of the 2005 CCHS (see tables in Appendix A), based on a large national sample (N= 132,221 ), indicates similar trends to those in the US (Milosevic & McConville 2007). It has been shown that among Canadians, falls cause the most serious injuries, most frequently in adults over the age of 65. In addition, slips, trips and stumbles as a cause for serious injury seem to have greater prevalence an1ong the elderly (Appendix A, Figure 4). Hospitalization and emergency room visits are also much higher among this group (Appendix A,

2

Figures 5 and 6), which is associated not only with falls-related hip fractures but with other results of falls such as fear of falling and isolation frmn society (Tinetti & Williams, 1997). Considering the fact that some 95o/o of hip fractures are caused by falls, Stevens & Olson (2003) advocate the development of new approaches to primary and secondary falls prevention, based on multifaceted strategies including changes to behavior and environment, with an emphasis on education and skills related to risk factors. According to data from the US National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, fallrelated injuries constitute a significant risk for the entire society, and for the elderly population in particular, since they represent a major cause of injury-related deaths and disabilities for this age group. The tnost serious falls-related injury .is the hip fracture, which in the US causes more than a third of a million (340,000) hospitalizations per year (Stevens & Olson, 2003). A tnore recent epidemiological study (Stalenhoef et al., 1999) found that the prevalence of falls among persons of 55 to 64 years was 25% and that among persons of 65 years and over it was 31%. The same study found that falls cause some 9% of serious injury, including 4% of bone fractures. Lord et al. ( 1994) found a similar rate of falls among persons over 60 years, who reported approximately 28% of falls during the past year. Examining falls prevalence, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (Talbot et al., 2005} has found that an1ong those who fell, 70.5% sustained injuries, and women reported a higher incidence of falls than men. Based on recent systematic reviews of evidence on falls and falls prevention, Rubenstein (2006) and Rubenstein and Josephson (2006) document the strong impact of falls on increased morbidity and mortality among the elderly, and their social consequences, including an increased use of health care and nursing home services.

Rubenstein and Josephson (2006) demonstrate the multiple causes .of falls and provide evidence that n1any of them can be eliminated through preventative interventions. According to these reviews, the most important factor is the availability of feasible and cost-effective comprehensive risk assessment tools for falls prevention, as well as the appropriate training progratns. In addition to hip fractures, falls are the second leading cause ·of traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is a 1najor contributor to tnorbidity and mortality in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003). Falls and other related balance impairments represent a serious risk for people who suffer from different neurological disorders (Stolze et al., 2004), as well as for able-bodied subjects (Popovic, 2000; Masani, Vette, & Popovic, 2006). Balance impairments are frequent and particularly high among ·people who suffer from stroke, TBI, incomplete spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, as well as among the populations previously discussed. For all of these groups, balance disorders have major social and quality of life implications, which require attention and exploration of effective ways to assess risk and develop training/rehabilitation programs that prevent falls. Risk assessment has a significant role for falls prevention, but the literature review (Boulgarides, et al., 2003) shows the low predictive power of classic clinical balance tests. In addition, the existing techniques for balance evaluation rely on either subjective or timeconsmning and expensive diagnostic methods. Also, the tnotion capture systems currently used for precise quantitative balance evaluation rely on expensive permanent research laboratory setups and thus are not feasible for clinical application.

Epidemiological studies show a high incidence of falls and their serious consequences for individuals with a history of falling, as well as for the healthcare system and society at large. Based on the suggestions from the literature related to balance and falls prevention and on the results from previous studies, my study focuses on specific aspects of arm movements, with particular attention on the impact of the dominant and non-dominant arms on balance, which is often the cause of serious injuries.

1.2 Arm Movements in Posture and Balance Numerous studies provide evidence of the important role of arm movements for balance maintenance and recovery, and of the increased risks of falling among the elderly because of deteriorating sensorimotor functions and less effective arm use (e.g. Allum, 2002). Specific age-dependent patterns of falls (e.g. Maki, Mcilroy & Fernie, 2003) show that older adults suffer head and knee injuries more frequently than younger adults (Talbot et al., 2005). A significant nun1ber of studies suggest that efficient arm movements strategies can significantly mitigate the consequences of falls (Kim & Ashton-Miller, 2003; Maki et al., 2007; Kim & Ashton-Miller, 2009). These studies provide support for the hypothesis that free arm tnovements, increased awareness and readiness to regain balance can contribute to efficient balance strategy. Similarly, Woollacott, Inglin and Manchester (1988), who explored the linkage between arm movements and · postural muscles, found a deterioration of the speed of activation in the control of postural balance. In addition, a study that explored the biomechanics of fall arrests and the use of the upper extremities (Kim & Ashton-Miller, 2003) emphasizes knowledge gaps

5

concerning their role during the fall impact. Examining the risk of future falling, Maki et al. (1994a) found that control of lateral stability n1ay be essential in falls preventative interventions. Based on a synthesis of studies related to change-in-support reactions, Maki, Mcilroy & Fernie (2003) documented the important role of grasping reactions .a nd the design ofassistive devices for balance recovery. According to this research, compensatory stepping and grasping arm moven1ents have a critical role in falls prevention. In a more recent study, Maki and Mcilroy (2006) presented an overview of new findings on stepping and reaching .movements and their relevance for falls prevention, and demonstrated the crucial impact of rapid limb movements on both this and balance recovery. The authors underline the role of lateral balance control, a factor which may prevent the lateral falls that often cause hip fractures. Despite the evident deterioration of the neural, sensory and/or musculoskeletal functions among older people, Maki and Mcilroy indicate the possibility of remodeling these functions, and advocate the more effective use of stepping and reaching reactions. Another study that investigated the impact of ageing on the directional sensitivity of balance corrections and the role of arm movements (Allum et al., 2002) also found that arm 1novements have a ·protective function but deteriorate with age. This study indicates that new . strategies of balance training should include arm movetnents as a significant factor for regaining balance controL A similar .conclusion is also presented in a recent study that etnployed a wide variety of biomechanical and electromyographic (EMG) measures, video recording, and accelerometeric and force-plate measurements (Yamazaki et al., 2005) to demonstrate that rapid arm movements together with hip joint muscles contribute to the maintenance of standing posture. According to the results in this study, rapid arm movements cause trunk muscle contractions that contribute to the stabilization of hip joints.

6

Concerning the possibility of arm movement changes, Borello-France et al. (2002) demonstrate that people suffering from vestibular loss .were able to alter their voluntary arm movements. A recent study (Bugnariu & Fung, 2007) also demonstrates the possibility of adapting sensory integration in older adults and improving balance capability through balance exercise, based on an innovative training program in a virtual environment. Another study of balance related to the virtual environments (VE) and vestibular rehabilitation conducted in the SPIRALL laboratoty provides indications of possibilities for improvement of balance through virtual reality based training (McConville, Virk & Milosevic, 2007). Mansfield et.al. (2007) indicate promising results through therapeutic ·approaches to balance rectification using a complex exercise program that provides a safe and effective environment for change-in-suppot1 balance reactions. Table 1.1: Hip strategy I CoM ·es Classified in the Literature. Ankle strategy

Leg& Trunk strategies

In summary, the major balance strategies addressed in the literature review are included in Table 1.1. They show the significant role of arm, leg and trunk tnovement strategies for falls prevention. Reaching and grasping movements are also regarded as prevention n1echanisms. Many clinical studies indicate the important role of free arm movements for activities relevant to balance maintenance or recovery. Bateni et al., 2004 have shown that the central nervous system gives priority to a holding task suggesting the importance of arm movement reactions.

Anticipatory postural adjusttnents (APA) of the body in response to voluntary arm movements have been studied and were found to be a significant factor in the ability to maintain postural balance (Horak & Macpharson, 1997; Yamazaki et al., 2005). Individual responses related to APA are supported by the theories describing balance as a dynamic integration of interdependent systems (Horak, 2006). It is important to investigate the role of arm movements as they relate to balance, and the possibility of correcting dynamic posture through better overall balancing strategies. My study will investigate the effects of arm movement dynamics on the dynamics of the trunk, which has been regarded as one of the most important balancing strategies (Redyke et al., 1999; Horak, 2006).

1.3 Handedness in Balance Postural control has been regarded as being dominated by the right hetnisphere. In a study analyzing the effects of stroke lesion location and dimensions, ·Pereru1ou .e t al. (1999) provided evidence of the existence of right hen1ispheric dominance for this ·function, showing lower postural performance in right brain-damaged patients than in left brain-damaged patients. Likewise, handedness has been thought of as a result of the control mechanism of the dominant hemisphere (Sainburg, 2007; Wang and Sainburg, 2007). However, recent studies contradict the idea that motor lateralization reflects a global advantage of one dominant hemisphere or limb system (Wang and Sainburg, 2007). The dynamic dominance model shows that each hemisphere/limb system is ·specialized for controlling different features of perfom1ance (Zhang et al., 2006). In a study of ipsilesional motor deficits following a stroke, Schaefer et al. (2007) confirm motor lateralization theory supporting that the

8

left and right hemispheres are specialized for controlling different features of moven1ent. This study demonstrated that dominant and non-dominant arms have distinct control mechanisms. Studies on handedness mainly exa1nine the role of different arms for manual motor control tasks. According to Sainburg {2007), this field requires further research; consequently, my thesis intends to examine the role of dominant and non-dmninant arm move1nents for maintenance of dynamic postural balance during balance board tests.

L4 Clinical Balance Tests for Risk Assessment Reviews of evidence on falls and falls prevention (Rubenstein, 2006; Rubenstein & Josephson, 2006; Horak, 2006) indicate the existence of knowledge gaps related to interdisciplinary studies, diagnostic procedures, and feasible and cost-effective balance assessment and training programs. Postural balance studies use a variety of methods, including biomechanical and EMG measures, video recording, accelerometeric and force-plate measurements. There are studies that report successful identification of people at risk of falling and fall-related injury (Lord et al., 1994; Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, 1998; Howe, 2006). However, several studies on musculoskeletal equilibrium and psychomotor performance (Fujiwara et al., 2001) indicate difficulties making complex and precise measurements and a lack of predictive validity for classic balance tests (Boulgarides et al., 2003). Other reviews of literature on falls prevention (Rubenstein, 2006; Rubenstein and Josephson, 2006) recognize sin1ilar knowledge gaps and emphasize the significant role of new strategies for falls prevention. There is also ·a need for the development of new methods for

9

diagnostics relevant for balance maintenance and balance recovery. My study intends to contribute to the body of knowledge and methodology of research on postural balance. Rietdyk et al. (1999) noted that most postural control studies have been limited by the available measures (kinematics, surface forces, and EMG) used to examine postural control. According to this study, it is important to consider a wider array of balancing tasks and to examine often ignored balancing strategies to provide a more cmnplete explanation of balance and falls-related risks. A recent review of existing and possible applications of accelerometers to rehabilitation medicine (Culhane et al., 2005) anticipates useful results from these devices. Similarly, Chiar (2005) · presents a prototype based on MEMS accelerometers that seems useful for balance rehabilitation and for diagnostics of standing balance. My study uses MEMS accelerometers to collect data from the external balance board, patient arms and CoM movements during balancing tasks.

lo5 Summary of the Literature Review Considering the consequences of falls (head, knee and hip injuries) and the role of arm movements in balance recovery and falls avoidance, my study aims to provide evidence related to arm movements and their function in maintaining postural balance. My ·study also provides evaluation of diagnostic devices for the examination of postural balance, as well as evidence for the effectiveness of balance training programs. It is expected that the presented study will help to make a positive social in1pact through falls prevention, and through a reduction in the number of emergency medical interventions and hospital admissions. As major studies in the domain of balance suggest (e.g. Horak, 2006), my project aims to

10

explore arm movements as a component of the multiple interdependent processes of postural control. Based on the suggestions from the reviewed studies and the results from our preliminary research, my study investigates dynamic balancing tasks on the balance board and, tnore specifically, examines arm tnovement strategies during these tasks. Particular attention is also directed to examining iateral balance, which is the cause of most serious hip fractures. The literature review also attests to significant gaps in knowledge related to specific aspects of reaching and grasping arm movements (Maki & Mcilroy, 2006), to the role of the upper extremities during the fall impact (Kin1 & Ashton-Miller, 2003), and to making precise and reliable measurements (Woollacott, Inglin & Manchester, 1988). Their ease of application, high sensitivity and low cost make accelerometer · sensors appropriate for the development of diagnostic and training devices that are feasible, sustainable and cost effective, as Rubenstein (2006) recommends. Through the developtnent of a new diagnostic tool, the following study can be expected to contribute to an interdisciplinary assessment and exploration of the factors that determine postural balance.

1.6 Objectives The review of existing literature shows that arm movements have an important role in balance maintenance and recovery, and that they can contribute to falls prevention among the elderly, who suffer the tnost serious consequences from falls. This study .intends to explore the characteristics of arm n1oven1ents and their relations to balance among the healthy middle aged. A particular intention ·of this study is to introduce n1ore objective criteria for balance assessment based on an array of kinematic measures of arm and

11

trunk movements. The presented study can also play a role in the explanation of processes that detetmine the dynamic postural balance. Numerous studies demonstrate that the incidence and severity of falls increase with age. Because of the growing elderly population, it is expected that the number of falls will rise, and this is an emerging health care and societal issue (Maki, et al., 2003; Rubenstein & Josephson, 2006). According to the cited studies, research should be directed towards · identifying determinants and risk factors, developing appropriate training programs and assistive devices, inventing ne\V methods for balance assessment, evaluation and rehabilitation, and implementing them in clinical settings. The first objective ··of my study is to demonstrate the application ·of ·new diagnostic instruments for balance and arm movements assessment, based on tri-axial accelerometers adapted to register the magnitude of tnovements during different balancing tasks. This is a novel method for balance assessment, using portable, cost-efficient and easy-to-implement accelerometer-based instrumentation. My second objective is to determine the role that arm movements play in dynamic balance. The study aims to provide a more specific diagnostic and classification of arm movements and their roles for balance maintenance. In addition, it examines arm dominance during balancing tasks. The specific objectives of my study are: · · To examine the effect of arm movements on classic balance test outcomes. To examine the associations between the results of classic balance tests and trunk movements (CoM) during limited and free arm movements. · To examine the specific impact of the dominant and non-don1inant arms on dynamic postural balance during stable and recovery balance periods.

2. Methods
2.1 Subjects
· This study included ten healthy volunteer participants who were examined on the classic balance tests. Four of these were further examined on the quantitative balance board test. The mean age of all respondents was 56, and all of them had a dominant right hand. All of the participants .were healthy middle-aged adults. The participants had no background of neurological or other underlying disease, no history or fear of falls, and no vestibular and/or somatosensory, cognitive or musculoskeletal impairments that might have testricted them in participating. Recruitment was done through flyers, online postings and word of mouth. The participants were compensated with light refreshments.

2.2 Protocol A cross-sectional study design with repeated measuretnents under different conditions was implemented. The testing included standard clinical classic tests and novel dynamic balance board tests. Each test was performed twice: for limited and free arm movements. In the first trial, the test was performed with the arms positioned against the body (limited arms), while in the second trial, it was performed with the arms being used freely (free arms). All tests were first demonstrated to the participants. Afterwards, the participants were allowed to fmniliarize themselves with the apparatus and the tests for a total of approximately 15 minutes before data was collected. The familiarization period was implemented in order to provide experience with the testing protocol to all participants before the data collection (Boulgarides et al, 2003; Dite, & Temple, 2002, Podsiadlo & Richardson, 1991 ). The complete series of tests usually took approximately 30 n1inutes.

13

The tests were performed without any support, but the investigator was always present to assist the participants to complete the tests safely. All participants were allowed to terminate the testing at any time if they felt uncomfortable with any of the tasks. However, all of them were able to complete the entire protocol successfully. This study was designed in accordance with Ryerson University Research Ethics Board procedures. The protocol was ilnplemented to represent a minimal safety risk, and ensured the participants' confidentiality. All of the participants consented by signing the participation agreement forms, and their confidentiality was ensured by coding any personal infonnation and securely storing all data. This study was approved by the Ryerson University Research Ethics Board (REB 2009-042).

Classic Balance Tests:
The classic balance tests are commonly used clinical and research balance tests found in the literature (Isles, et al., 2004; Vaughan, Davis and 0' Connor, 1992; Hausdorff and Alexander, 2005) and adapted for the purposes of examining the effects of arms. Each test was performed for the limited arms and free arms conditions. During the balancing tasks, .the dynamics of the trunk (center of mass - CoM) were recorded. For each test, the standard performance outcomes were also measured and evaluated. The classic balance tests include evaluating the following tests .of balance .performance: · Maximal Step Length Test (MSL): Beginning from a standing position, the participant is required to make the maximum step forward and return to the starting position, while keeping the other leg fixed. Perforn1ance is measured by the step length and the time taken to return to the initial position (Cho, et al., 2004; Lindemann, et al., 2008; Lindema1m, et al., 2004; Schulz, et al., 2007).

14

·

Step Test (ST): The participant is required to stand on one leg, facing a wall, 5 em from an 8.5 em high block (41crn wide by 72 ctn wide) positioned against the wall, and to step on and off the block with both feet (one at a time) as many times as possible in 15 seconds. The total number of steps is counted (Dite, & Temple, 2002 ; Hill et aL, 1996; Isles et al., 2004 ; Nnodim et al., 2006).

·

Timed Up and Go Test (TUG): Beginning from a sitting position, the patiicipant is required to stand.up, walk 10 feet forward, turn around, go back, and sit down on the chair. The time needed to execute the test is evaluated (Podsiadio & Richardson, 1991; Jaglal, Lakhani Schatzker, 2000).

·

Walk along an Elliptical Line (WEL): Beginning from a standing position, the participant is required to walk along an elliptical path (major axis== 1.5m, minor axis= 3m) and return to the original position. The time needed to complete the task is evaluated (English, et al., 2007; Salbach, et al., 2001; Suzuki, et al., 1999; Wade, et al., 1987).

Balance Board Tests:

Additionally, participants were assessed on the novel dynamic balance tests. The balance board tests consist of maintaining balance on the modified clinical balance tool - a balance board (Mechling, 1986; Ferrell et al. 2004) that has been instrumented to monitor balancing performance. There are three variants of the balance board test that assess all directional balance, as well as lateral and anterior-posterior balance separately (see Balance Evaluation section). The tests consisted of 1naintaining balance on the balance board for one minute, and all the measurements were recorded for post-processing. During the experiment, there were no unexpected tasks or events. The investigators were always present during the experiment to assist in the cmnpletion of the tests if necessary.

15

Each of the balancing tasks was evaluated under lin1ited arms and free arms conditions. During these tasks, the dynamics of the arms as well as those of the balance board were recorded. Figure 2.1 shows the experimental setup during the balance board tests. The Balance Board tests require the following perfonnance: · The participants were asked to stand on the balance board and to maintain balance. This study uses three types of balance board. The first balance board moves .in all directions (CBB), the second examines anterior-posterior (AP) balance only~ and the third examines lateral (LAT) balance only.

2.3 Balance Board
A commercially available, round balance board (PT Balance Board, PTfitness) was used (5.5 em high, 36cm diameter with 18 degrees of inclination).

Figure 2.3: Shows the balance board used in the AP and LAT balance board tests. The balance board can move only in the selected direction and is constrained in other directions; a) AP and LAT test balance board; b) AP and LA T balance board maximal range of motion. The balance board is a standard wobble board used in clinical settings for physiotherapy. Several studies (Mechling, 1986; Ferrell et al. 2004) show that they provide valuable information for postural balance diagnostics. In addition, it has been shown that exercise programs on balance boards can significantly itnprove patients' postural balance and muscle strength (FetTell et al. 2004) and overall functional capacity (Diracoglu et al., 2005). Nordt at al. (1999) also demonstrate the usefulness of balance board . . based training for the elderly. The existing evidence supports the use of balance boards as a relevant and meaningful tool for dynamic balance evaluation.

2.4 Data Acquisition The experimental measurements were taken using MEMS differential capacitance accelerometers (Kionix Inc., USA, model KXM52-l 050 and Analog Devices Inc., model MMA 7260Q, 3..axial accelerometer with a range of ±2.0g).
17

For the classic balance tests, the CoM accelerometer was placed on the trunk to measure trunk dynamics. A digital stopwatch and measuring tape were also _ used during data acquisition for the classic balance tests to assess the performance using standard·measures. For the balance board tests, the accelerometers were placed on both arms and on the balance board. An additional accelerometer was placed at the CoM (on the trunk) to measure trunk movements, as shown in Figures 2.1 and Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.4: Sensor placement for the Balance Board test

The study data acquisition is based on the application of accelerometers with a ±2.0g force range, a sensitivity of 1V/g for the supply voltage Vdd=5V and with the Og offset set at Vdd/2 for the KXM52-l 050 accelerometer (Kionix Inc.). The signals were filtered to provide tilt and relative displacements appropriate to the diagnostics of human movements, including arm and trunk frequencies and balance board n1ovement diagnostics. The packaged sensors were firmly fixed in the gloves on both anns and on the belt close to the trunk of each participant, as well as on the balance board.

18

Signal Acquisition and Processing

Signals were acquired using a 12-bit data acquisition system (NT-USB 6008, National Instruments) and were fm1her processed on a PC station (DELL XPS Laptop with an Inter Pentium 4 CPU 3.40GHz, 1.00GB RAM). Real-time acquisition and processing were performed using a Lab VIEW 8.0 (National Instruments) custom-built application. The post-processing and filtering were performed using Matlab 7.0 (Math Works, Inc.). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0.1 (SPSS Inc.) and Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc.).

2.5 Signal Analysis The analysis and preparation of kinematics data included filtering, segmenting and calculating the vector magnitudes of the tri-axial accelerometer readings. Signals were processed and analyzed according to the tnanufacturer's calibration specifications (Kionix Inc.). The evaluation of accelerometer vector magnitudes (which are a measurement of the magnitude of the accelerations being applied) (Kionix Inc.) is a physiologically meaningful manifestation of arm movements. The measurements of acceleration magnitudes and comparisons of magnitudes and variations over time provide physiologically interpretable results about arm movement dynamics (Jackson, 2003; Steele et al., 2000). However, the accelerometer data units are not biologically meaningful, since they do not calibrate against external measures of atm movements during balance. The unit calibration is not necessary for the purposes of my study, since my goal is to evaluate time trends and compare dynamics over time. The following analyses of the data were carried out:

- Band-pass filter: Since most human movements occur in the 0.3 to 3.5 Hz range (Steele et al.,
2000), the signals were filtered to eliminate unnecessary frequencies above I OHz. For the applications ·where only tilt was being observed, the signal was filtered to obtain the DC values.

19

- Moving average filter: In order to reduce computational complexity and remove noise from the
signal, a 1O·point moving average filter was applied to the accelerometer data, according to Equation 1 (Rangayyan, 2002).
y(n) =-:Lx[n-k] 10 k=O

(Equation 1)

-Vector Magnitude Unit (VMU): Accelerometer outputs (acceleration) were measured in three
spatial dimensions (X, Y and Z vectors), and combined to represent movements according to Equation 2 (Steele et al., 2000; Kionix Inc.). (Equation 2)

- Segmentation: Balancing tasks were segmented into two regions based on the accelerometer tilt
dynamics measurements from the balance board during the balancing tasks. The stable (balance maintenance) regions were periods with below-average balance board activity and the unstable (balance recovery) regions were those with above-average balance board activity, where the subject is recovering from loss of balance (see Figure 2.5). The algorithtn for segmentation is based on finding the regions with a higher level and concentration of balance board movements and detecting the locations of these events independently of the number of their occurrence and duration throughout the testing period. After the segmentation, the analysis is performed synchronously for both arms (right and left arm dynamics) and analyzed in two different balance regions (stable and unstable balance regions).Data segmentation is performed by post-hoc analysis using a custom-made Matlab program.

Balance Regions Detection Algorithm

The balance regions detection algorithm is based on analyzing signal slope, amplitude and width components (Rangayyan, 2002) of the balance board accelerometer.signals. It is based on the adapted theory from the Pan and Tompkins (Tompkins, 1995; Pan and Tompkins, 1985) algorithm for ECG signal analysis. The block diagram implementation for the balance regions detection algorithm is shown in Figure 2.6.

The balance board acceler01neter signal readings are pre-filtered by hardware using a low-pass filter (fc=0.16Hz). After acquisition, the algorithm is applied to segment the signal into the regions. The following is an explanation of the filtering process:
- Noise removal: The 10-point tnoving average filter (Equation 1) is applied to remove any

interference noise from the signal, after which it is down-sampled.

21

- Derivative & Squaring Operations: The derivative operation highlights the high slopes of the

signal attributed to the fast balance board movements, which are indicative of loss of balance, and suppresses the low-frequency components. The filter used in Equation 3 is ideal for processing signals up to 30Hz (Rangayyan, 2002). The squaring operation further etnphasizes the lower values, which are due to the loss of balance, and takes the absolute value of the signal.
y(n)

= -[2x(n) + x(n -l)- n(n- 3)- 2x(n- 4)]
8

1

(Equation 3)

- Integration Operation: The moving-window integration filter performs an enveloping operation,

which helps to easily recognize the multiple regions of balance loss during the duration of recording. A window size ofN=80 was found to be -ideal for precisely highlighting the regions of balance loss for this type of signal independently of their frequency of occurrence, duration arid magnitude. The implementation of the filter can be seen in Equation 4 (Rangayyan, 2002).
1 y(n) =-[x(n-(N -I))+x(n-(N -2))+... +x(n)] N

(Equation 4)

- Thresholding: The thresholding procedure is used to define the regions of balance loss, based

either on an experimentally determined threshold or a user definable input value. This allows the user to define the sensitivity of selection to reflect the individual subject's differences and their abilities to maintain balance on the balance board.
- Time-shift: It was determined _ that a titne-shift of N=30 was necessary to select the regions

properly, due to the filtering offset.

t~test

procedures were applied to compare the n1eans_of the classic balance

tests performed under different conditions (restricted and free ann tnovements ). · One-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) was used to determine the effects of arm movements on accelerometer-based Balance Board test perfotmance. · Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the impact of dominant and non-dominant arms during stable and recovery periods of balance maintenance during balance board tests. · Differences in the variability of arm movements were analyzed using Levine's Test for Homogeneity of Variance, to compare dominant and non-dominant arms and to analyze balance recovery regions. · The association between performance on the classic .balance tests ·and trunk movements were analyzed using
Spearman~ s

correlation coefficient.

All · statistical tests were two-tailed and the resulting significant statistics were flagged with asterisks. One asterisk (''*") denote statistics significant at the 0.05 level (two-tailed). Two asterisks ("**") signify statistics significant at the 0.01 level (two-tailed), and three asterisks (''***")represent statistics significant at the 0.001 level (two-tailed).

3. Results 3. 1 Classic Balance Tests and Arm Movements
This chapter cotnpares the results that were achieved on the classic balance tests with limited arms and with free arms during the performance of the balance tests. The paired sample t-test analysis was used to compare the perfonnance with limited and free ar1n movements on each classic balance tests. Significant improvements were shown ·with free arms use on five out of six classic balance test tneasures.

Ma.x:imum Step Length (MSL) Test
The Maximum Step Length (MSL) Test requires participants to make the maximum step forward with one leg and then return it back to the starting position, while the other leg remains in the original position. The performance was measured by evaluating the time to return to initial position and the length of the step. Also the speed of performance was computed and evaluated.

Time 011 Maximum Step Length (tMSL) Test
The results on the tMSL test show (Table 3.1.1) that the average time for completing MSL test decreased by 0.47 seconds (16.4o/o) with the free arm use (t=3.217, p<O.Oll).

The Kolmogorov-Smimov and Shapiro-Wilk tests (Table 3.1.3) both indicate that the results on the tMST test follow the normal distribution. Another test (Table 3.1.4) shows that variance of the tMST results are homogeneous and satisfy the conditions for doing the t-test.

Figure 3.1.1: Time on Maximum Step (tMSL) Test ResultsDistribution

The MSL test measures the respondents' mobility, balance, and risk of falls (Cho, Scarpace & Alexander, 2004). Consequently .from these results it can be suggested that arms use improves mobility, control of postural balance and decreases the risk of falling as measured by the performance on the MSL tests. This information is significant for precaution during daily activities, for risk assessments, diagnostic, and for balance rehabilitation.

Length ofMaximum Step Length (lMSL) Test
In addition to time, the MSL test measures step length. The study shows (Table 3.1.5) that the average length of the step increased by 12cm (10.8o/o) when arms were used freely. The paired t-test shows that this difference is significant (t=-5.840, p<O.OOl).

According to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests (Table 3 .1. 7), both free and limited arm result distributions for the IMST test can be assumed normally distributed. Another test (Table 3.1.8) shows that variance of the lMST results is homogeneous and satisfies the condition for doing the t-test analysis.

Figure 3.1.2: Length of Maximum Step Length (lMSL) Test Results Distribution

The increase in the step length with the free arm movements suggests that there is an increase in the region of the comfort and perhaps the region of stability during the step. This tnay be attributed to the increased readiness and comfort which allows the person to take the bigger step as well as to the improved lateral balance needed during the task of stepping forward.

Speed ofMaximum Step Length (sMSL) Test
The study shows that participants achieved the biggest improvements with free am1 use on the speed of Maximum Step Test (sMST). The speed parameter was computed from the distance and time measures. The average speed (sMST) increased by 2lcm/sec (40%) when arms were used freely {t=-3.199, p<0.011).

Figure 3.1.3: Speed of Maximum Step Length (sMSL) Test Results Distribution

Since the speed of the Maximum Step Test (sMSL) improves the most when arms are used freely, it is likely that therapeutic programs for balance rehabilitation can improve mobility and balance, and minimize the risk of falls through improving their speed on the MSL test. This finding also emphasizes the need for risk assessment and valid diagnostics of dynamic postural balance and the effects of arm movements during balancing tasks, since the arm movements have a significant effect on the outcomes of the MSL test performance.

Step Test (ST)
The Step Test (ST) requires pat1icipants to stand on one leg, 5 em from an 8.5-cm high block positioned against a wall. Participants were required to step on and off the block (with both feet, one at a time) as many times as possible during the 15 seconds period, and the number of steps was noted by the investigator. The ST shows (Table 3.1.13) an average increase of 3.6 steps (29.8%) during the fifteen seconds period (t=-3.478, p<0.007) with the free arm use.

RS (num. of steps)

Figure 3.1.4: Time on the Rapid Step Test (ST) Results Distribution Many studies have shown that rapid stepping has a significant impact on balance through the change of support reactions as a balance recovery mechanism (e.g. Maki, et al., 1996). Hence the RS test is important to examine with regards to balance and falls prevention. The results demonstrate that free or improved arm movement can increase the rapid stepping abilities that have been associated with a lower risk of falling (Maki et al., 1994a). These findings also suggest that ann tnovetnents can decrease the risk of falls thought rapid stepping reaction itnprovements.

Timed Up and Go(TUG) Test
The Timed, Up, and Go Test (TUG) requires participants to quickly and safely stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters forward, turn around, go back to original position and sit down on the chair. The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) showed an average speed increase of 0.73 seconds (11.2%) with free arm usage. As Table 3.1. 17 shows, this difference is statistically significant (t=3.803, p<0.004).

200 l ). In this way the arm movements may positively be contributing to the decreased likelihood of.falling (Morris, Monis & Iansek, 2001) through examining dynamic common tasks in .the TUG test.

Walk along an Elliptical Line (U7EL):
The Walk along an Elliptical Line (WEL) test requires the participants to walk along the perimeter of an ellipse marked on the floor and stop when they return to the original starting position. The test (Table 3.1.21) gave no conclusive results (t=l.lOl, p<0.300) although there is a trend showing increased walking speed.

Exploratory analysis of the WEL test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests (Table 3.1.23) shows that the distribution of the results achieved on this test with limited arms is nonnally distributed while distribution of test results with free arm movements is significantly different from normal distribution. Graphical representation of the results shows greater variability of the free arm movements on the WEL test and · increased standard error (Table

3.1.22) that tnight have contributed to the inconclusive result for the WEL test.

WEL (sec.) Figure 3.1.6: Time on the Walk along Elliptical Line Test (WEL) Results Distribution

The lack of difference between performance on the .WEL test with limited and free arm movements could be explained by the fact that the walking test is not sensitive enough to detect the changes of the effects of arms. Shnilarly it can be argued that the test gait speed is not significantly affected by the arm movements as measured by the WEL test.

Concluding Remarks: Impact of Arm Movements on Classic Balance Tests
The paired sample t-test analysis for each of the classic balance tests, which compares the performance during restricted arm use (the arms against the body) and free arm use, shows significant improvements in regard to the average performance on five out of the six classic balance tests (Figure 3.1.7). In summary, the results show that the average step time (tMSL) decreased by 0.47 seconds (16.4%) with the free ann movements (t=3.217, p<O.Oll) and that the step length (lMSL) increased by 12cm (10.8%) when arms were allowed to move (t=-5.840, p<O.OO 1). The speed on the MSL test also had the biggest improvements (40%) when arms were used (t=-3.199, p<O.Oll). The Step Test (ST) also shows an increase of 3.6 steps (29.8%) during
a fifteen second period (t=-3.478, p<0.007); and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) showed a

time increase of0.73 seconds (11.2%) with active arm usage (t=3.803, p<0.004).

39

The results achieved on these tests suggest increased perfotmance on the standard balance .tests and better balancing abilities with active arm usage .. The results suggest a higher speed, better confidence and readiness as well as the increase in the stability regions and balance, as indicated by the performed tests results. The Walk along an Elliptical Line (WEL) Test gave no conclusive results (t==l.IOl, p<0.300) although it showed a trend towards performatice.

The results .ofthe achieved increase in performance on the classic balance tests with free arms show that ann movements have a significant impact on the maintenance of balance during balancing tasks. These results provide a strong indication that diagnostic and training of postural balance can improve maintenance of postural balance during activities of daily living and can decrease the risk of falls. These findings indicate the need to further examine the specific actions of the arm movements during balancing and their in1pacts on the trunk (CoM) movements.

41

3. 2 Classic Balance Tests and Trunk Movements (CoM)
A growing number of studies that use electromyographic, video, accelerometeric and force-plate measurements show that · ann and trunk movements have significant impacts on postural balance (Allum et al., 2002; Yamazaki et al., 2005). These studies usually require the use of complex and expensive laboratory equipment suitable for experimental study, but less applicable for studying activities during daily living out of a laboratory environment. One objective of my study is to determine the impact of arm movetnents on postural balance using portable accelerometer-based instruments. Comparisons of performance on the majority of the classic balance tests using limited and free arm movements presented in the previous section shows significantly improved performance with free use of arms. Arm movetnents have been shown to have a significant impact on trunk movements (Yamazaki et al., 2005); my study fulther .examines these associations to detennine the effects of arm movements on dynamic postural balance strategies. To explore the role of arm movetnents on different systems of dynamic balance maintenance, my study examines the associations between classic balance tests perfonned with limited and free arm movements and the magnitude of the centre of mass n1ovements (CoM VMU).

Time on Maxinzum Step Length (tMSL) Test
CotTelation analysis (Table 3.2.1) shows a significant association between movements of the centre of mass (CoM) with the time on the Maximum. Step Length (tMSL) test. The associations between CoM and tMSL with limited (r=-0.812, P<O.Ol) and free (r=-0.774, P<O.Ol) arm tnovements are significant and show that participants who achieve a shorter tin1e on the tMSL test have a greater magnitude of CoM movement.

In addition to the shorter MSL time, conelation analysis (Table 3.2.2) shows a significant association between movements of the centre oftnass (CoM) and the thneon the Maxin1mn Step Length (lMSL) test. The analysis shows that the association between CoM and IMSL with free

Figure 3.2.3: Scatterplot of Results on the Speed of Maximum Step Length (slVISL) Test and Trunk Movements (CoM VMU} with Limited and Free Arm Movements. In summary, the results show that CoM movements have a significant association with the speed of the MSL test, and indicate that speed significantly determines participants' mobility and postural balance (Cho, Scarpace & Alexander, 2004). The results provide strong indications that arm movements contribute to an in1proved speed of ambulation and CoM mobility, and can hence decrease the risk of falls. This finding is relevant for balance rehabilitation programs and for usual daily activities, particularly among the elderly and people with impaired balance.

The results show that CoM movements are not significantly associated with the Step Test (ST), indicating that increased CoM mobility is not significantly associated with rapid stepping tasks. Despite the lack of statistical significance, stepping reactions are very important in

46

everyday life as well as in falls prevention, as shown by Maki & Mcilroy (2006). However, it can be argued that stepping reactions are less influenced by CoM dynamics.

Correlation analysis (Table 3.2.5) shows a significant association between movements of the centre of mass (CoM) and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. The associations between CoM and the TUG test with limited (r=0.831, P<0.003)and free (r=0.814, P<0.004) arm movements are significant and show that participants who achieve shorter times on the TUG test have greater magnitudes of CoM movements.

These results show that the magnitude . of CoM n1ovements is significantly associated with the TUG test, which measures the ability to perform sequential locomotor tasks like walking and turning more effectively (Morris, Morris & Iansek, 2001 ). They also show the increased speed of the TUG test and more homogenous results that indicate the possibility for improving dynamic postural balance.

Concluding remarks: .Associations benveen Arm movements and CoM
Through the application of accelerometer-based tests, it is possible to examine balance maintenance on a balance board, as well as the specific impact of am1 movements on the movements of the centre of mass (CoM). This section discusses the associations that were found between classic balance tests and the magnitude of CoM movements, as well as indications that the magnitude of CoM movements increases when participants use arms freely during balancing tasks. The results suggest that am1 movements contribute to the increased magnitude of trunk movements, which are required to adjust the centre of mass to the base of support, most likely through an increased counterbalancing mechanism. The greater control of trunk speed and the rigidity of trunk movements were also shown to be significant determinants of postural balance (Maki & Mcilroy, 1994, 2006; Allum et aL, .2002; Yamazaki et al., 2005).
It has been shown thus far that an11 movements have a positive impact on postural

balance and CoM dynamics. Now, specific arm movement mechanisms and strategies during dynamic balance remain to be examined in more detail. The next section will investigate the mechanisms of ann movements specifically for balance maintenance and recovery and the role of ar:m dominance in dynamic balance.

48

3. 3 Balance Bo~rd Tests and Arm Movements Tests
The objective of this part of my study is to determine the role that arm movements play during maintenance of dynamic balance. Furthermore, this section exatnines the impact of arm movements on ·balance, with specific emphasis on arm dominance different balancing tasks.

Arm Movements during Complex (CBB) Balance Board Test
Analysis of the magnitude of accelerations for arm movements during balancing tasks (Table 3.3.1), based on a one-way ANOVA, shows that the average magnitude of arm movements (VMU) are different and statistically significant (F= 133.829, P<O.OOI). Further analysis using a
two~·way

ANOVA shows that the interaction between arm movements during

stable and recovery periods for both dominant and non-dominant arms are statistically significant (F=l0.776, P<O.OOl). A comparison of stable and recovery regions during balancing tasks (Table 3.3.1) that includes both arms (recovery regions for left and right and stable regions for left and right arm movements) shows that these summarized measures are not statistically significant (F==8.936, n.s.). Also, a comparison of arm movements that summarizes the averages for recovery and stable periods is not statistically significant (F=27.405, n.s.). In sumtnary, this analysis shows that the average n1agnitude of arm acceleration is significant, while cotnparisons of aggregated data for regions of balance or aggregated data for arm movements and non-dominant arms are not significant.

Analysis of the results of arm tnovements during the con1plex balance board (CBB) test (Table 3.3.2) shows that the nonudmninant arm has a greater average acceleration than the dominant arm during both recovery and stable periods. During periods of balance recovery, the dmninant arm exerts greater average motion (VMU=3.91) than during stable periods (VMU=3.82). Conversely, during balance recovery, the non-dominant arm makes slightly greater average tnovements (VMU=4.00) than during periods of stable balance (VMU=3.96).

In addition to differences between averages of ann movements, the ·analysis shows an apparent variability in the movements of both dominant and non-dominant arms during the CBB test (Table 3.3.3). Levene's Test for Equality of Variances shows that: · Variance of dominant arm movements during both stable (0.3456 vs. 0.1866, Levene's Test

F= 955.345***) and recovery (0.2579 vs. 0.1966, Levene's Test F= 39.099***) periods is
significantly greater than that for the non-dominant arm. · Variance of dominant arm movements during stable ( .3456) periods is greater than variance of movements during recovery periods (0.2579, Levene's Test F= 351.941 ***).

By contrast, variance of non-dominant arm movements is similar in both recovery ( .1866) and stable {.1966, Levene's Test F= l.158n.s) periods of balancing tasks.

Individual Arm Movements Strategies during the CBB Test
Further analyses were conducted for each individual participant by examining their ann movement dynamics (e.g. Figure 3.3.2) and the effects on the stability scores. The stability

51

scores were computed by examining the percentage of balance time in the stable region. It is considered that better performance means longer stable periods of balance 1naintenance during the test. Interpretations of the arm movement dynamics include the comparison of intensity of movements (VMU) for dominant and
non~don1inant

arms in the stable and recovery regions. The

analysis also includes comparisons of variability of movements and coordination between dominant and non-dominant arms. A series of analyses of the ann movements during the Con1plex Balance Board (CBB) Test shows that participants who used both am1s equally during the recovery and stable phases achieved better results (Subjects Al, A2 and A3). The analysis also shows that in order to achieve better results, the greater overall use of arms is beneficial. As the resultsfro1n Subject A4 show, it seems that greater discrepancy between dominant and non-dominant arm movements, as well as a · low intensity of arm movements during the stable period, lead to less efficient control of dynamic balance during cmnplex balance tasks. Overall, these results indicate that, as long as both arms perform coordinated movetnents to a similar extent and as such cancel out the moments, the ·outcomes for complex dynamic postural balance are better. The subsequent results are for the CBB test and arm movement dynamics for each of the participants (Subject Al-A4) that were discussed in the preceding interpretation.

Arm Activity during Anterior-Posterior (AP) Balance Board Test
In the analysis of variance (Table 33.12), a one-way ANOVA shows that the overall mean differences are statistically significant (F= 36.366, P< 0.001). A more specific,
two~way

ANOVA indicates that interaction differences for both arms during different balancing regions are significant (F= 92.108, P< 0.001 ), while comparing aggregated atm movements that do not reflect the specific phase or period of balance maintenance is not statistically significant.

Table 3.3.12 Analysis Variance for Arms Acceleration (VMU) during Periods of Stable and Periods of Balance Recovery during the AP Test ~~~ F s~ One-Way ANOVA 36.366 .001 Two-Way ANOVA F Sig. Regions .064 .842- n.s Arms .388 .645 - n.s 92.108 .001 Interaction Regions x Arms Analysis of the results evaluating the magnitude of arm acceleration during the AP balance board test (Table 3.3.14) shows that the dominant arm (VMU=3.74) applies lower acceleration during periods of balance recovery than the non-dominant atm (VMU=3.93). Contrarily, during periods of stable balance on the anterior-posterior test the dominant arm applies a slightly higher acceleration (VMU=3.89) than the non-dominant ann (VMU=3.88). Arm movetnents during the stable phase of the anterior-posterior balance board test yield slightly contradictory results to those of all other tests. This finding requires further attention through similar studies examining the anterior-posterior balance mechanisms. Table 3.3.14 Magnitude of Movements of Dominant and Non-dominant Arm Acceleration during the AP Test Region Arm Mean VMU Stable Right (dotninant) 3.89 Left 3,84 Recovery Right (dominant) 3.74 Left 3,93

57

Similarly, both the dominant and non-don1inant arms during the anterior~ posterior balance board test (Table 3.3 .15) show relatively small variability of movements. Levene's Test for Equality of Variances shows·that: · Variance of dominant arm movements during both stable (.4200 vs . .3818,Levene's Test F= 17.563***) and recovery (.4037 vs .. 3748, Levene's Test F= 39. 31.027***) periods is significantly greater than variance of n1ovements for the non-dominant arm. · Variance of dominant arm movements during the stable (.4200) period is greater than that of movements during the recovery period (.4037 Levene's Test F= l.OlOn.s').
· By contrast, the variance of non-dominant arm movements is similar .in both stable (.3818)

and recovery (.3748, Levene's TestF= 17.114n.s) periods. Despite the fact that these differences are relatively small, three out of four tests confirmed that they exist at a statistically significant level.

The graphical representation of variations during balancing tasks on the AP balance board test (Figure 3.3.6) demonstrates the greater variability of acceleration ofthe dominant arm than of the non-dominant am1 during the recovery .periods, implying greater control by the don1inant arm. The graph also shows that there · is no significant difference during the stable phase between dominant and non-dominant arm acceleration.

Individual Arnt Movements Strategies during the AP Test
The results from the Anterior-Posterior (AP) Balance Board Test are to some extent different than those from the complex and lateral balance board tests, but also show some similar tendencies. The best results were achieved by the participants who exerted a similar intensity of n1ovements with both dominant and non-dominant arms (Subjects B 1 and B2). Also, better results were attained by those who used their arms to a similar extent during both balance phases (Subjects B2 and B 1). Worse results were achieved by the participants with a greater discrepancy between dominant and non-dominant ann movement intensity (Subjects B3 and B4), possibly by the induced momentum shifts. Also, the respondents who had difficulty maintaining anteriorposterior balance showed a greater discrepancy of arm movements during recovery and stable phases of balance (Subjects B4 and B3).

59

The worst results on the AP balance board test were achieved by the subject with the lowest intensity of arm movements during both phases of balancing tasks (Subject B4). In addition to low intensity, the same subject also demonstrated a visible difference between the magnitude of dominant and non-dominant atm movements, as well as a greater difference between arm movements during different phases of balance maintenance. The subsequent results are for the AP test and ann movement dynamics for each of the participants (Subject Bl-B4) that were discussed in the preceding interpretation.

Arm Activity during Lateral Balance{LAT) Board Test
A one-way ANOVA (Table 3.3.24) shows that differences among the mean magnitudes of arm acceleration are statistically significant(F= 104.674, P< 0.001). Likewise, the two-way AN OVA presented in the same table shows that ·interaction differences among all means are statistically significant (F= 14.784, P< 0.001), while a comparison of aggregated means for arms and phases of balance during balancing tasks is not statistically significant.

In addition, the analysis shows an evident variability of acceleration for both dominant and non-dominant arms during the lateral balance board test (Table 3.3.26)" Levene's Test for Equality of Variances shows that:

Individual Arm Movements Strategies during the LAT Test Superior results on the Lateral Balance Board (LAT) Test were achieved by the participants who exerted similar intensities of ann movements with both dominant and nondominant arms (Subjects C2 and C 1). Also, better results were accomplished by the participants who used arms to a similar extent during the recovery and stable phases of balance (Subjects C2 and Cl). The participants with a greater discrepancy between the recovery and stable phases of balance maintenance (Subjects C3 and C4) achieved lower scores on the LAT test. In addition, there was a noticeable difference between dominant and non-dominant arms (Subjects C3 and B4) during the recovery phase. Results on the lateral balance test also show that better coordination, or similar extent of movements between the d01ninant and non-dominant arms, plays a significant role in balance maintenance. These tendencies are similar to those discussed for the complex and anteriorposterior tests. The subsequent results are for the LA T test and ann movetnent dynamics for each of the participants (Subject Cl-C4) that were discussed in the preceding interpretation.

Concluding Remarks: Arm Movement Strategies during Dynamic Postural Balance

In the majority of cases where subjects achieve lower results on the balance board test, they demonstrate ·a lower . intensity of .arm moven1ents during stable periods of the balancing tasks. This type of ann movement can be defined as a '"passive strategy" of arm use, and it is characterized by a lower intensity of movements or passive maintenance of postural stability. From this passive position, it is probably more difficult to respond to any kind of balance perturbations and to regain postural balance during recovery periods, when participants have to adjust their center of mass (CoM) to the base of support. Results from the .accelerometer-based balance tests also show that a .lower magnitude of non-dominant arn1 movements is frequently accompanied with lower achievement on a balance board test. In addition, results indicate that better coordinated arm moven1ents are a precondition for better maintenance of dynamic postural balance. In .sun11nary, this chapter presented the results of the analysis of arm tnoven1ents during maintenance of postural balance ·on instrumented balance board tests. ·Atm movements were analyzed during stable regions and regions of balance recovery. This chapter also examines the role of dominant handedness for balance maintenance and recovery. Analysis of.the impacts of the dominant and non-dominant arms during balance found that they have different patterns and functions. There are evident, and statistically significant differences concerning the ·magnitude of arm movetnents, .and a particularly strong difference of variability of these movements.

4. Discussion
Arm Movements and Balance The presented study contributes to the knowledge related to arm movements and their role in dynamic postural balance. Specifically, the findings from classic balance tests suggest that the arms play an important role in the itnprovement of balance. The results also provide evidence that atm use during the performance of balance tests significantly alters the trunk dynamics (measure of CoM). Based on the perfotmance on the classic balance tests, the results indicate improved maintenance and recovery of postural balance with free arm movements. Classic balance tests have provided indications of improvements in mobility, balance, and prevention of falls (Cho, Scarpace & Alexander, 2004) when the anus were actively used during the MSL test. Also it can be suggested that participants improved their lateral balance and overall balance comfort level when they used arm freely. The RS and TUG tests suggest that arms help in shifting the CoM more quickly. This is evident because of the increase in the number of steps on the RS test and the faster ·performance on the TUG test. These findings suggest an improvement of the ability to perform sequential locomotor tasks (Mon·is, Morris & lansek, 2001) and a CoM sifting speed increase during the
sit~to-stand

transfer. The RS test in1provements suggest the existence of a better falls prevention

mechanism because of the improvement in the stepping and change of support reaction abilities (e.g. Maki et al., 1996). The results of the cotTelations between the trunk (CoM) movements and the ranked classic test performance suggest the positive impact .of arm· movements on CoM dynan1ics.

Dynamic Arm Dominance in Balance

The analysis of overall perforn1ance tendencies for all participants indicates certain trends and specific strategies of arm movements that are used during dynatnic balance. The observations from the results of all three variants of the .balance board tests (CBB, AP and LAT) indicate that the non-dominant arm has a greater average · acceleration than the dominant arm for both recovery and stable balance periods. On the other hand, the variance of the dominant arm movements during both stable and recovery periods is significantly greater than the variance of movements for the non-d01ninant ann. These observations suggest that the dominant arm is more variable or that it has a dynamic function during balance, whereas the nondominant arm seems to have a more static role. Examination of individual performance and dynmnics indicate that there are distinct strategies being applied during balance. However, the prevalent trend for the majority of participants and 'balance board tests is that coordinated and similar movement dynamics of both arms generally lead to better balance. These findings are very relevant, since they ptovide support for a new model of dynamic arm dominance that can be specifically applied to the task of dynamic balance maintenance. They support the recent studies that contradict the previously proposed tnotor lateralization model, which emphasizes the global advantage of one dominant hemisphere or limb system (Schaefer et al., 2007). The findings uphold the dynamic dominance tnodel (Zhang et al., 2006; Wang and Sainburg, 2007), which e1nphasizes the idea that each hemisphere/limb system is specialized to control diverse features of performance. Specifically, it shows that the left and right hemispheres are specialized for controlling different features of movement (Schaefer et al., 2007).

76

My results provide support for dynamic dmninance as it applies to balance maintenance and arm movements. They show that the dominant arm controls the more dynamic parameters by being more involved in balance, and that the non·dominant arm has a more steady function during dynamic balancing tasks. Furthermore, my findings indicate the achievement of better balance when both arms are used in a complementary way. These findings are in direct support of the dynamic dominance model of handedness, which argues that the dominant arm performs better in coordinating intersegmental dynamics, speed, direction, and curvature, whereas the non-dominant ann tends to perform better in steady state positions (Sainburg, 2007).

Arm Movement Strategies in Balance
Analysis of the overall trends of perf01mance for aU participants indicate that during balance recovery, the dominant and non-dominant arms both made greater average movements than during periods of stable balance. The analysis also shows that the variance of dominant arm movements during the stable period is greater than that during the recovery period. Further examinations of individual performance and dynamics on individual levels indicate that lower results on the balance board tests are usually consistent with a lower intensity of arm movements during stable periods of balance. This type of arm moven1ents during balancing tasks can be defined as a passive strategy of balance. Contrary to the passive strategy is the active strategy, which generally produces better balancing with a more involved use of arms. It seems that the active strategy of anns used during both stable and recovery balance regions is more efficient for maintenance of dynamic postural balance,

77

Needless to say, these results indicate the importance of arm movements in balance. It can be argued that these movements have distinctive roles during both stable and balance recovery periods. The active use, counterbalancing strategy seems to be the principal one during dynamic balancing tasks. Overall, the results suggest that arm movements have a significant impact on postural dynamic balance and indicate that efficient strategies of arm movement can improve balance maintenance and recovery, likely through counterbalancing with arms. Several previous studies evaluating balance (Allum et al., 2002) also support the counterbalancing view. Allum et aL (2002) found that trunk stiffness, which is typical among the elderly, might be corrected through the compensatory mechanism of ann movements. The results are also consistent with the active strategy proving the importance of arm movements during balance.

Arm Moventents and Lateral Balance
Maki and Mcilroy (2006) report the crucial role of lateral balance for falls diagnostics and prevention. Similar indications were also suggested by the classical balance tests and by the balance board tests. The overview of balance board test performance implies ·that arm movements have the most important function during the LA T test. This leads to the idea that arm movements are specifically important for lateral balance and for falls prevention (Maki and Mcilroy, 2006). Analysis shows the greatest changes in outcome performance during the LAT test. Moreover, the worst trends· and individual ann movement strategies can be seen during the AP test, suggesting a lower interaction between anterior-posterior balance and ann movements. The

78

CBB test is a combination of lateral and anterior-posterior balance, and the arm movement dynamics seem to have an intermediate effect.

Standardization of Testing with an Instrumented Balance Board Sheet
In order to simplify interpretations of the test results, based on the experience gathered through the analysis of individual results, proposed is an Instrun1ented Balance Board Sheet. The form (Figure 5 .l) is a procedure and a data collection sheet that can assist .and standardize the data collection on the balance board tests. and interpretation of arm movements during balance. The main purpose of this fotm is to aid and simplify interpretation of the arm movement strategies and results from balance board and to provide the guidelines for developtnent and evaluation of balance training. The histograms facilitate cmnparison of the intensity of dominant and non-dominant arm movements, evaluation of atm coordination, and analysis of correspondence of arm activity during stable and recovery phases · of balance maintenance. In addition ·to visualization of test results, this sheet · can also help in conversion of the accelerometer measures (VMU) .into a standardized scale, more suitable for analysis of balance and arn1 movements in clinical practice. The standard scales include the range of intensity (1 to 5), coordination (Low, Moderate or High) and correspondence (Small, Partial or Optin1al) of arm movements during different periods of balancing tasks.

5. Conclusions
Dynan1ic postural balance is a skill significant for aU human activities, and, according to Voermans et al. (2007), balance impainnents tnanifested through postural instability are the main non-environmental, age-related cause of falls. This study presents a novel device and clinical evaluation tool for the diagnostics of dynamic postural balance and arm movements as means to assess risk of falls and to provide a cost-effective portable system for dynamic balance assessment. Based on the results and experience it can be argued that am1 movements are an important strategy in dynamic balance maintenance. Despite the fact that this study examines the balance and ann movements of able-bodied subjects, its results are also applicable for people with impaired balance. This type of study, according to clinical research studies (Popovic et al., 2000; Masani, Vette & Popovic, 2006), provides results that can be applied for rehabilitation and development of assistive devices. The presented
accelerometer~based

device and assessment protocol for cost-effective,

quantitative, and portable balance and arm movements diagnostics in clinical settings provides a valid set of measures relevant to risk assessment, evaluation of dynamic postural balance and training. Since balance control is a complex skill (Horak, 2006), based on different processes and the integration of different visual, vestibular and proprioceptive sensory systems, further study should be directed toward exploring the interactions between these systems, and developing diagnostic devices that simultaneously examine these factors and their relationship ·to ann movements and balance. In addition, future studies should address the evaluation of lateral

82

balance which, according to the literature (Maki & Mcilroy, 1994, Allum et al., 2002; Yamazaki et al., 2005; Maki & Mcilroy, 2006), is highly important for the prevention of falls that often cause serious hip fractures. In conclusion, my study shows that arm movements have an important role in balance maintenance. The develop1nent of training programs based on these findings and provided clinical tools can contribute to falls prevention among people prone to falls. Based on the suggestions from the literature related to balance and falls prevention, and on the results and experience gathered in this study, further research should be directed towards specific aspects of arm movements related to their direction, with particular emphasis on lateral balance. Also, it would be particularly important to develop a standard set of test norms for balance and arms movement strategies among different population groups.
