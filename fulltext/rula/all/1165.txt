The multitude of food recalls in 2007 clearly demonstrated that total nitrogen-content (EN)

determination by means of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (MRS) can be deceived, and should no
longer be regarded as a complete quality assurance program for nutritive-protein evaluations. Furthermore, contemporary Canadian-employed analytical tools are precariously limited in their

ability to effectively assure a product where there is no a priori knowledge of the environmental toxin(s) involved. In light of these challenges, this study explored a number of new analytical
techniques used to assess and furthermore assure the quality of Vegetable Protein Products (VPPs). Using LC/MS/MS/MS technologies, a combination of VPP-based samples were analyzed for the presence of nitrogen-bearing environmental toxins. Of the 117 test-runs,

involving an assortment of matrices, Melamine (MEL) arrcf Cyanuric Acid (CYA) were positively identified (> 1 PPM) in 22 and 17, respectively. Subsequent HPLC-UV Amino-AcidProfiling further confirmed the adulteration of those materials contaminated with Melamine-andRelated-Compounds (MARC).

1.1 Food Safety In Canada

With a prodigious reserve of land and water resources, Canada's requirement for progressive food safety and nutrient management programs has become a sine qua non in recent years. Moreover, Canada's food processing industry is constantly growing, employing well over 250,000 Canadians. In 2005, an additional $1.81 of gross domestic product was indirectly

Figure 4.10: Linearity of wet food MEL calibration curve (range: 500 ppbto 5000 ppb)

91

created in the economy for every $1.00 of gross domestic product produced within the industry. Following this trend, 2.55 jobs were indirectly created for every job supported by these activities. In 2006 Canada was the world's fifth largest agriculture and agri-food importer, accounting for 2.8% of total global imports. That year Canada was also the fourth largest exporter, representing
3.5% globally (GTA, 2006; AAFC, 2007).

Canadian use of protein meals sourced from cereal grains and vegetable products such as corn,

rice, soy and wheat reached record highs in the past 5 years, with a national consumption of over 1.5 megatons (Mt) of soy alone. Unable to source that demand locally, an estimated 80% was imported during that time. This trend has quickly developed, with a marked decline in the ratio of commodity exports to imports over the past five years. For example, the trade balance of vegetable protein products (VPPs) has decreased from close to 70% in favour of exports in 2002,
to less than 30% in 2006 (AAFC, 2008). These statistics, coupled with the fact that in 2006 over 65% of consumer products sold in Canada were imported (GOC, 2008), should inspire an

increase of large-scale risk assessment research to minimize the likelihood of a food-related catastrophe. Moreover, as the food-web is a highly vulnerable pathway through which environmental toxins can infiltrate Canadian ecosystems, biomagnify and accumulate over time, national environmental infrastructure development is promptly required. In essence, as the complexity of the global agri-food market continues to expand in this direction, so too must the
scope of quality assurance programs designed to promote food safety and security.

The core Canadian food safety and security programs are managed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), in collaboration with several organizations at the federal, provincial and municipal levels. With a mandate "to protect Canadians from preventable food safety

hazards, to ensure that food safety emergencies are effectively managed, and that the public is
aware of-and contributes to-food safety," the CFIA has continually evolved over the years to
meet the increasing quality demands set by consumer expectations (CFIA, 2008).

Inspection Act and the Canada Agriculture Products Act, further compliance assessments

required by the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations are typically exercised by the CFIA;

(CFIA, 2008).

Imported cereal products, including VPPs are regulated by the Canada Grain Act and its Canada Grain Regulations. Also monitored by the CFIA, along with the Cereal Research Center (CRC),

Further demonstrated with the Canadian Food Safety Adaptation Program (CFSAP 1999), food

applied here, in full compliance with international trade standards of food safety as established
by the Codex Alimentarius (CFIA, 2008). By providing incentives to national associations involved in all facets of the industry to act in accordance with its policies, from production to marketing of foodstuffs, the inauguration of CFSAP spearheaded the development of risk
Most recently, in December of 2007, the federal government unveiled plans for a new program

that purports to strengthen enforceable legislation by imposing tougher regulations on food
products. The proposed Food and Consumer Safety Action Plan (FCSAP) has promised to
improve on the current CFIA programs by:

management strategies designed to strengthen quality assurance measures throughout the food
chain. Despite this significant achievement; however, these measures were strictly voluntary,
without any real devices of enforceability (CFIA, 2008).

·

Working with industries, provinces and territories to implement preventative food safety
control measures along the food chain;

In 2003 CFSAP was replaced by the Canadian Food Safety and Quality Program (CFSQP), adding dimensions of quality and traceability to the national program (AAFC, 2003). Central to
this initiative was the consideration of feedback coming from interest groups including the CFIA,

Health Canada, provincial and territorial governments, academia, the Canadian Federation of
Agriculture and national product organizations (Canadian Horticultural Council, Canadian Produce Marketing Association, the Cold Chain, the Canadian Trucking Alliance, etc.), which served as a mechanism to constantly question and thereby improve food safety practices in
Canada (Jolet al, 2003).

Only time can demonstrate the significance of the FCSAP, its ultimate success and whether it will truly address the current lack of legislative powers that exists in Canada to control toxic substances entering the country through the food-web. Here there is a significant requirement for
the CFIA to launch itself into the vanguard of environmentally conscious food-safety research, with authoritative powers that dovetail the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA).

Today, HACCP compliance is compulsory in all federally-inspected meat and poultry processing

plants (CFIA, 2000; Gagnon et al, 1999). Where not already governed by other bodies of

1.2. Wake-up Call: Food Recalls

As contaminated VPP sources were discovered in the human food supply, on April 3, 2007 the issue spiraled into the mainstream. Traced to thirty-eight farms in Indiana, an estimated 80,000 grain-fed chickens raised for human consumption were found to have consumed melamineadulterated feed. Swine farms in several states were also identified as having fed contaminated
products to approximately 56,000 swine (USFDA, 2007).

Despite the apparent safeguards of the Canadian agri-food sector, a multitude of food product
recalls in 2006 and 2007 spawned a deep-seated lack of consumer confidence in many

Canadians. For instance, the unfortunate affliction of 30 Ontarians poisoned by E. coli-

contaminated lettuce supplies in 2006 raised serious questions about the integrity of the national

food safety network (CFIA, 2008). Adding insult to injury, the unprecedented product recalls of
2007 that followed exposed one of the largest-scale food safety failures of our era.

Pet owners and consumers demanded explanations as to how such a disaster could have occurred on such a widespread scale, especially in the US which is heavily regulated by government bodies such as the FDA and American Associated of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).
Questions in the vein of "how can you assure the safety of your product" were raised throughout

Announced on March 16, 2007, in response to 6 reported dead pets by consumers and an

independent feeding trial that killed 4/19 cats within 3-4 days, and produced vomiting and

lethargy in 10/10 dogs in a 2-day period, the Canadian-based Menu Foods Income Fund recalled

the bulk commodities food trade.

(MFIF, 2007). As further pet-death reports started to surface in the media, toxicology and food science groups at the University of Cornell, the University of Guelph, the American Veterinary
Medical Association, as well as several other industry leaders initiated efforts in search of the source of the contamination. With only kidney failure as a guide, several toxins were suspected: citrinin, aflotoxin, keatoxin, T2-H2T, ethelyne glycol and oxotoxin. As a common ingredient
linking the affected brands became apparent, laboratories across Canada and the US began heavily testing wheat gluten samples, without any traces of the suspected compounds. What
hastily ensued, fueled by unrelenting demands from media and public interest groups, were
restless bouts of rigorous scientific investigation (RCC, 2007).

1.3. Implications

As the literal livelihoods of those involved in the production, processing, sale and reprocessing

of VPPs are dependent on the delivery of quality assured raw materials, the need for timesensitive and cost-effective monitoring systems has arisen in response to great demand. With a
North American economy so heavily reliant on low-cost food supplies coming from foreign countries such as China, the development of such programs fulfills much more than a basic requirement; it has become a critical component of the Canadian food chain. Likewise, with the food-web so closely interrelated to human, animal and environmental health, greater attention is required in several government ministries. For improvements to be made, no longer can assurances from trade partners guide industry practice, but rather, as Jol et ah (2006) explain, "each partner in the chain, be it producer, manufacturer, handler or vendor has an important role

In collaboration with University of Cornell, samples received at the New York State Food
Laboratory were found to contain aminopterin, an antineoplastic agent. However, without

reproducibility and/or symptoms consistent with aminopterin poisoning, the United States Food
and Drug Administration (USFDA) and Cornell University rejected the findings and continued searching for a more fitting contaminant (USFDA, 2007). In the weeks that followed, melamine, along with its analogues, was identified in raw material wheat gluten samples and finished product samples, as well as in the urine of affected pets. Crystals would also be found in the
renal tubules of autopsied pets (UOG, 2007).

to play in ensuring that the product is of sound" food integrity."

Moreover, in consideration of the ever-increasing role of VPPs in nutrition, the need to
accurately monitor environmental contamination by means of nitrogen-bearing toxins such as

melamine and its derivatives is crucial. Limited successes have been previously achieved using

Gas Chromatography techniques. More advanced tools involving Liquid Chromatography show
promise, but not to the required extent. As tremendous negative public opinion towards imported

food supplies sourced from China increases, the technique or combination of techniques best suited to a comprehensive quality assurance program of VPPs is in considerable demand.

of melamine, cyanuric acid and their analogues is further explored, alongside the toxicological

profile of each. Drawing on pathological data provided by investigators during the pet food recalls of 2007, the most widely accepted causal theories of pet deaths and poisonings are
discussed.

Scientists who support the industry must do their part in helping the trade and the citizens that
rely on it to be better protected in the years ahead.

Subsequently, the most widely adopted quality assurance programs for VPPs are reviewed
1.4. Thesis Outline

(Section 2.4.), followed by a discussion on Canadian legislation requirements for monitoring compliance. This area highlights an overall deficiency in legislative support, enforceability and
compliance-incentives for industry stakeholders.

In light of these challenges, this study will focus on three predominant VPPs that are widely
applied in human and animal nutrition: Wheat Gluten (WG), Soy Protein Isolate (SPI) and Rice Protein Concentrate (RPC). Each commodity will be discussed in great detail (Section 2.1.), with

a focus on the unique functional properties that support their beneficial application in food manufacturing. Along with the increased popularity of these products as a consequence of such advantageous properties comes great risk to the end consumer, as well as the surrounding natural
environment.

The experimental hypothesis and objective is then stated (Section 2.3.3.) which leads into the Materials & Methods (Section 3). Subsequently, the Results & Discussion (Section 4) are presented, including a look at the economic viability of the required analytical instrumentation
(Section 4.4.), followed finally by the Conclusion & Recommendations (Section 5).

Other parameters highlighted include the inherent nutritive properties of each VPP, including

data pertaining to digestibility, amino acid content and protein density. In the experimental
section of this paper (Section 3) it will become evident that these parameters are critical factors

continued use demands improved monitoring programs.

In the following section (Section 2.2.1.) protein content determination methods will be described

Gliadin monomers, the lower in molecular weight of the two (25,000 - 100,000 MW), are inelastic and become viscous upon hydration (Veraverbeke & Delcour, 2002). Due to their
Since the first breads were created, WG's role as a functional protein with a host of nutritional benefits has been paramount. Containing extremely low concentrations of indigestible proteins (1-2%), WG is used in products ranging from human nutrition (breads, pastries, nutritional beverages, creamers, fat-filled powders, laminated dough, pastas, breakfast cereals, energy bars,
soy sauces, savoury flavourings, meat products and vegetarian meat-alternatives) to pet food and

intramolecular disulfide linkages, this extensibility allows gluten to expand when pressure is applied, a critical component of the leavening process in baking. Glutens form complex networks
that trap carbon dioxide produced by yeast, giving breads their characteristic texture and airbubble appearance (Veraverbeke & Delcour, 2002; Tate & Lyle, 2005).

livestock feed applications. The caloric density of WG proteins is roughly 4 kcal per gram of
product (Tate & Lyle, 2005).

Glutenin polymers, on the other hand, are highly flexible, much larger in molecular weight (>100,000 MW) and consist of subunits linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. This provides
for strength and resilience due to an elasticity and low extensibility that resists external pressure
(Hoseney, 1994; Veraverbeke & Delcour, 2002; Tate & Lyle, 2005).

The apparent digestibility of proteins derived from WG is relatively high (Table 2.1). In fact, no other vegetable protein source contains as little indigestible matter as wheat gluten. Soy Protein

Isolate (SPI), the next closest match in these terms is 2-3% less digestible.

Perez-Conesa et al (2001) observed 96% in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) in human infants fed WG based formula (Perez-Conesa et al, 2001). In further digestibility trials that compared spray-dried plasma protein to WG, standard ileal digestibility was 9% higher in piglets fed the WG alternative (Stein & Pedersen, 2005). As a consequence, WG is frequently used in milk replacement products for calves, piglets, chicks and veal, as well as aquaculture feed and pet
food.

2.1.1.5. Industry Overview

In addition to its highly digestible properties, WG possesses a rich amino acid profile that is abundant in glutamine, proline, cysteine and methionine.but is low in lysine (Prange et al,
2004). This characteristic amino acid profile is especially useful in preparing dietary

With production levels exceeding 603 million metric tons (MMT), wheat is the most abundant

cereal grain in the world (FAO, 2008). Canada is the world's sixth largest producer, with 27

Accordingly, this study will argue (Section 4) that amino acid profiling is the most effective standalone means of assessing and subsequently assuring the true quality of VPPs such as WG.

has risen consistently in the past five years (Table 2.3).

Increased availability of WG from the European Union, Australia, China and other foreign countries has further reduced domestic prices, allowing for greater commercial applications of the ingredient (Table 2.4).

The whole beans are cleaned, dried, cracked, de-hulled, conditioned and rolled into flakes. Residual hexane is then removed and the resulting meal is ground (Mcklem, 2002). The remaining defatted flour is then combined with deionized water at a 15:1 water-to-flour ratio,

as trimers through the Golgi Apparatus to PSVs. There they are cleaved into 40 kDa acidic and 20 kDa polypeptides (Bennett, 2005).

and the pH is adjusted to 8.5-9 with sodium hydroxide (2 N NaOH). The slurry is then stirred
and centrifuged to produce the first protein extract (Deak, 2007).

iteta-conglycinins are glycoprotein trimers with a', a, and /? subunits (Bennett, 2005). Due to

their nutrient-dense, phytochemical and protein-rich compositions, along with non-protein coproducts like isoflavones and saponins, great interest in /?-conglycinin and glycinin proteins has

The resultant material is then combined with CaCl2 and NaHS03, is subsequently stirred and

prevailed (Murphy, 2000). As a consequence these proteins have been propelled to large-scale applications in both human and animal nutrition. Additionally, /?-conglycinin globulins have received special attention due to their nutraceutical properties as well (Deak, 2006). Accordingly, this trend poses a great vulnerability in the food chain, as the pervasiveness of soy-based proteins

The second protein extract supernatant is then adjusted to a pH of 4.8 with HCL, is stirred and

Further differences among the two fractions have been documented; /?-conglycinin proteins have been shown to contain considerably fewer sulfur-containing amino acids, with 3 to 4 times less

cysteine and methionine per unit of protein than glycinin (Fukushima, 1991). Research has
revealed that it is possible, through genetic modification and/or varying environmental

conditions (i.e. sulfur deprivation, nitrogen supplementation, etc.), to encourage the seeds themselves to optimize this imbalance (Clark, 1999; El-Shemy etal, 2001). El-Shemy etal.,
2.1.2.3. Main Fractions

(2001) determined that some mechanism in the seeds is responsible for regulating the varying amounts of each storage protein, which might be used to "selectively increase the type of storage protein" desired (El-Shemy et ah, 2001). Thus, by selectively increasing the concentration of

The two major storage proteins used as specialized protein storage vacuoles (PSV) in soybeans account for 70% of the total seed protein: /?-conglycinin (7S globulin or vicillin-type) and glycinin (1 IS globulin or legumin-type) (Derbyshire, 1976). As the highest protein-contents are contained herein, environmental contaminants such as melamine, cyanuric acid and their analogues can be deliberately incorporated into the production process to mimic quality proteins such as /?-conglycinin and glycinin. To a much lesser extent, other proteins present in the soybean include lectins, 2S albumins, defense proteins (i.e. protease and amylase inhibitors),
lipoxygenases and vacuolar hydrolytic enzymes (Kinney, 2001; Bennett, 2005).

glycinin, a more pronounced 11S/7S ratio allows for a more complete amino acid profile in the
end product (El-Shemy et ah, 2001).

Functionally, /?-conglycinin and glycinin protein fractions differ in three areas: emulsification, thermal stability and gel formation, iteta-conglycinin proteins are thermally more unstable than glycinins, but possess a more favourable emulsifying and emulsion-stabilizing ability. Glycinin proteins on the other hand produce harder heat and calcium induced coagulum (i.e. tofu gel) than

Glycinins are hexamers with an approximate mass of 320 to 375 kDa, and account for 60% of the total globulin fraction. They are encoded by a gene family designated Glyl to Gly5 and are synthesized as precursors on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) where they are transported

y#-conglycinin derivatives (Panizzi, 2005).

Further studies have shown 1 IS globulins to withstand higher surface pressure and reflectivity of chemical sprays (Sanchez, 2003). Additionally, the hydrophilic nature of SPIs allow for water absorption and retention even when subjected to outside forces such as gravity, centrifugation
and heating (Zayas, 1997).

Gilani and Sepehr (2007) found SPI and mustard flour to be the most digestible vegetable protein
sources assessed with young rats, with other sources ranging from 66-83% digestibility. These

results were consistent with previous data in human nutrition and in swine studies, which both
assessed SPI at a digestibility level of 97% (Kayser, 1992; Grala, 1998).

2.1.2.4. Nutritive Application

In addition to delivering highly digestible proteins, SPI further possesses an excellent amino acid profile. The FAO and WHO consider SPI "a complete protein," given that it meets or exceeds the essential amino acid requirements for humans aged 2-years and older, including children,
adolescents, and adults (FAO/WHO, 1991).

Containing exceptionally low concentrations of indigestible proteins (3-4%), SPI is used in a variety of products ranging from human nutrition (infant formulas, soymilk, comminuted meat products, meat analogues, tofij, breakfast cereals, yogurts, cheeses and meal replacement beverages) to pet food and livestock applications (puppy and kitten milk replacement products and highly digestible feeds) (Hosken, 2003). The increasing consumer demand for SPI-fortified products has lead to strong competition in extraction and recovery methods, with several ongoing patented and patent-pending applications. That being the case, what cannot be ignored is the potential for profit-driven manufacturing practices to gain popularity, at the expense of endconsumer safety.

As seen in Table 2.7, SPI is truly a complete protein, rich in essential amino acids such as

leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, threonine, arginine, valine, isoleucine, tryptophan and histidine. Methionine and cysteine are provided as well, although to a lesser extent.

At the same time, although more expensive than Soy Protein Concentrates (SPCs), isolates
provide enhanced flavour and colouring to nutritive products (Mcklem, 2002). The caloric density of Soy Protein Isolate is roughly 3.38 kcal per gram of product (CondeNet, 2007).

Defatted ground rice is used in protein extractions, as free-fatty-acid-formation and oxidation are common risks associated with the handling and storage of whole grain rice (Adebiyi et al, 2007). Historically, alkaline solutions were regularly employed in RBPC extraction processes (Cagampang et al, 1966; Lynn, 1969; Chen and Houston, 1970; Lew et al, 1975; Connor etal,

1976; Barber and De Barber, 1997; Betschart et al, 1977; Juliano, 1985; Bera and Mukherjee, 1989; Gnanasambandam and Hettiarachchy, 1995). The well accepted Obsborne method involved sequential extractions of water, dilute salt, dilute alkali and 70%-ethanol solutions

The Codex Standard For Rice (198-1995) does not include an international definition of "rice protein," "rice gluten," "rice protein concentrate," or "rice bran protein isolate," nor does it include any further reference to any protein source coming from rice. For that reason regulation
of these ingredients is poor, making source security a global issue.

(Padhye and Salunkhe, 1979). These conditions were later found to alter the nutritional integrity
of the product, compromising the amino acid profile by producing anti-nutritional factors such as
lysinoalanine (Otterburn, 1989; Cheftel etal, 1985).

More recent efforts have shown that methods applying the use of enzymes, typically

carbohydrases, a-amylase, hemicellulase, cellulose, pectinase, protease P, phytases and/or
xylanases (Figure 2.5), are more appropriate for rice bran protein extractions, without detriment

Grossman et al 1980; Ansharullah etal, 1996; Shih and Daigle, 1997; Shih etal, 1999; Hernandez et al, 2000; Tang et al, 2003).

Due to their oil binding and air-water interface stabilizing properties, rice bran protein concentrates (RBPC) produce stable emulsions under conditions of high salt and sugar concentrations (Chandi and Sogi, 2006). Nevertheless, their emulsifying properties are lower than that of SPIs (Adebiyi etal, 2007). The macromolecular disulphide complexes formed by

glutelin fractions are able to form stable gels at low concentrations (Agboola et al, 2005). For
this reason their applications are wide-reaching; they're found in weaning products, baked goods, whipped toppings, salad dressings and dry mixes (Chandi and Sogi, 2006).

2.1.3.3. Main Fractions

Rice proteins consist of soluble and insoluble protein/glycoprotein fractions. Within the

soluble fractions are water-soluble albumins, along with salt-soluble globulins and
ethanol-soluble prolamins. Albumins and globulins are found within the aleurone layer of the bran. The remaining fraction consists of insoluble glutelins (Wang etal., 1999). Agboola et al. (2005) found Australian brown rice cultivars to contain (Table 2.11) predominately glutelin, followed by globulin, albumin and prolamine.

Owing to its hydrophobic, intermolecular hydrogen and disulfide bonding properties, glutelin is the major storage protein of rice (Hamada, 1996; Juliano, 1985). Two covalently linked major polypeptide subunits have been identified: one basic (19-25 kDa) and one acidic (30-39 kDa)

production of exceedingly large macromolecular complexes that limit their functional uses (Utsumi, 1992; Katsube-Tanaka et al, 2004; Van Der Borght et al, 2006).

Digestibility of rice proteins is greater than 90% (Wang etal, 1999). Consisting of a high protein (70-76%) and lipid (15%) content, rice bran proteins have shown promise with high nutritional value (NRC, 1989; Kennedy & Burlingame, 2003). Extending to fish nutrition for its performance in digestibility trials (Palmegiano etal, 2007; Ronyai and Gal, 2005; Sullivan and Reigh, 1995; Ufodike and Matty, 1983), RBPI surpasses all other cereal-based protein and vegetable protein product sources with the exception of WG (Palmegiano et al, 2006) and SPI. Apparent protein digestibility values of up to 90.93% were reported by Palmegiano et al (2006)
in Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Ufodike and Matty (1983) recorded similar results at
88.00% apparent protein digestibility in Mirror Carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Ufodike and Matty,

High in valine, histidine and tyrosine, RBPI is in accordance with the essential amino acid
requirement established by the FAO/WHO/UN Expert Consultation (1985) on human growth (<2-years of age) energy requirements, but is limited by leucine, Iysine, isoleucine, threonine and tryptophan. For 2 to 5-year-old children, RBPI is closer to meeting the complete requirements for
essential amino acids, limited there by only Iysine and threonine (Wang et al, 1999;

FAO/WHO/UN 1985). Consequently, rice-based proteins pose a great vulnerability to environmental contamination and/or fraudulent processing practices as their intended endproduct consumers are within a highly sensitive segment of the population.
Moreover, as they are colourless and bland to the taste, rice bran proteins are also used to produce protein-based edible films that may serve as carriers for nutritional additives, antibiotics and antimicrobials (Chrastil, 1992; Shih etal, 1996; Czechowski & Stoodley, 2002; Adebiyi et al, 2006). Because they contain a relatively high asparagine and glutamine content, rice proteins
further demonstrate flavour-enhancing properties that might eventually replace monosodium glutamate (MSG) in Asian cuisine (Hamada et al, 1998). Data obtainedfrom Morita and Kiriyama (1993) and Wang et al. (1999).

Protein extracts coming from rice bran are higher in Iysine content than endosperm protein.
According to Juliano (1985), rice bran proteins contain more Iysine than any other cereal bran protein source. Chandi and Sogi (2006) further demonstrated that rice bran proteins display a richer Iysine profile than casein, whole grain wheat and corn (Kik, 1957; Chandi and Sogi,
2006).

As no internationally regulated standard definition for protein extracts coming from rice bran or

within the Harmonized System of trade commodities. Nevertheless, industry estimates can be made by examining the commodities from which rice protein extracts are produced: rice flour
and rice bran.

2.2.1.1. Wheat Gluten

Easily obtaining meaningful crude protein values from VPPs is challenging, due to the wellaccepted fact that it is nearly impossible to completely extract and subsequently prepare pure protein for analysis (Williams, 1998). As such, the protein content of gluten samples is typically
assessed through an estimation of the total nitrogen content (XN) present. Protein and nitrogen contents are especially correlated in methods of analysis pertaining to agriculture products (Sundqvist, 1973). As the total nitrogen content in a foodstuff is the summation of nitrogen

groups coming from the protein, amino acid and peptide groups, 2N is multiplied by a nitrogen-

factor of 6.25. As amino acids contribute roughly 16% of the protein weight, the conversion
factor for food products is set at 6.25 (Simonne, 1997; FAO, 2005). Due to a slightly greater Namino contribution (17.54%), 5.7 is the reference conversrm factor used in the wheat and flour industry (Simonne, 1997; Williams, 1998). The alternative reference process is the Kjeldahl (1883) method, which involves oxidation by means of boiling corrosive/hazardous chemicals
(Jones, 1992;Buckee, 1994; Simonne etal, 1995; Etheridge^a/., 1998; Williams, 1998).
2.2.1.2. Soy Protein Isolate

The same preparation and extraction complications seen in WG-determination regularly affect SPI analyses. Hence, the protein content of a given sample is similarly assessed through an estimation of its total nitrogen content.

Despite non-equivalence in values obtained by the two approaches, with results from the Dumas
method consistently displaying levels 1.4% higher, the empirical conversion factors used
internationally are based only on the Kjeldahl method (Thompson et ah, 2002). The degree to

According to the Kjeldahl reference method for protein determination, a conversion factor of 5.71 should be applied to SPI materials, while 6.38 should used for cow's milk proteins and their partial hydrolysates. This discrepancy is the result of an investigation by the International Dairy Federation (IDF) (ref. Codex ALINORM 05/28/26, Appendix IV (A)) that determined the

In recent years the conversion factor of 5.7 has been replaced by 6.25. In the case of vital and devitalized WG, the CODEX-STAN 163-1987 Rev 1-2001 norm sets the minimum protein content (N x 6.25 on dry substance) at 80%, excluding added vitamins, minerals, amino acids

2.2.2.2. Cyanuric Acid & Its Intermediates

Cyanuric acid [CAS: 108-80-5], an odorless white crystalline solid, has a structure of C3H3N3O3 that although not as rich as melamine, contains 33% nitrogen by weight (Chemfinder, 2008). Cyanuric acid can exist in two tautomeric forms (Fig. 2.9) (Kuznesof, 2004).

The planar three-fold symmetry of cyanuric acid has been confirmed by neutron diffraction and
X-ray crystallographic studies (Coppens & Vos, 1971).

Toxicological data aside, by no means should melamine, cyanuric acid or any of their intermediates be found in human or animal food products, at levels above those that would be naturally present in the general environment. Moreover, neither compound is approved by the

Industrial manufacturing of cyanuric acid involves pyrolyzing urea, which dissociates into

Despite this, melamine and its analogues were found in samples of vegetable proteins and have been directly implicated in the 2007 recalls. Given that neither compound appears especially
minacious alone, researchers now believe that reactions between them are the mechanism for toxicity (AVMA, 2007; Puschner etal, 2007; UOG, 2007; USFDA, 2007). Accordingly, the

isocyanic acid and ammonia. Isocyanic acid trimerizes to cyanuric acid, which is then purified, and subjected to acid digestion, converting acyclic impurities to carbon dioxide and ammonia.
Additional reactions between urea and isocyanic acid lead to equilibrium amounts of ammonium
cyanate, along with the intermediates biuret and triuret (Wojtowicz, 1993; USFDA, 1997;
Kuznesof, 2004).

experimental design of this study includes analytical testing protocols for both melamine and
cyanuric acid composites in VPP-evaluations and strongly recommends them as part of a

comprehensive quality assurance program.

Ammination of biuret and triuret results in cyclic aminotriazine by-products (Fig. 2.10),
primarily ammelide, ammeline, and minor amounts of melamine (Kuznesof, 2004;
Boitsov,1962). At a pH of 5.8, melamine has been shown to react with cyanuric acid, forming an insoluble compound consisting of 50.58% cyanuric acid by weight (Nelson, 1967). Whitesides etal (1995) confirmed this reaction to be a non-covalent synthesis of 1:1 hydrogen-bonded adducts between melamine and cyanuric acid to form rosette-shaped structures. Moreover, this adduct is a highly hydrogen-bonded solid of limited solubility in organic solvents (Ranganathan, 1999).

To the contrary, older research suggests that melamine might pose great risks than assessed
today. For instance, Mackenzie (1966) found that doses of 250 mg/kg fed to sheep lead to

Researchers at the University of Guelph Laboratory Services confirmed severe toxicological agents at play, with several cases of acute renal failure in cats that had consumed tainted pet food. Further analyses involving microscopic imaging techniques revealed a series of insoluble

complete food refusals and weight loss in the majority of animals, while a smaller group who were also fed low-quality hay as a complement, died. Newton and Utley (1978) also observed melamine-induced food refusal in 4/6 steers at concentrations of 100 mg/kg. Further research by Clark (1966) confirmed that ingestion of 250 mg/kg of melamine was lethal to some sheep in the study; necropsies of affected animals revealed aggregates of densely-packed melamine crystals
in the kidneys, along with severe tubular damage.

According to the USFDA, "observed effects include: reduced food consumption, body weight loss, bladder stones, crystalluria, epithelial hyperplasia of urinary bladder, and lowered survival
rate. However, no kidney failure or clinical symptoms of kidney failure were observed from these studies, including in a dog study" (USFDA, 2007; Clayton, 1982; USDHHS, 1983).

Worst-case scenario assumptions were assessed with intake levels of 150-^g of melamine
compounds per person per day or 2.5 |ig/ kg bw/day for a 60 kg individual. These values were based on the following parameters: melamine compounds are present in all solid food at a level of 100 ppb (ug/kg); a person consumes 3000 g (or 3 kg) of food per day, of which 1500 g is from
solid food (USFDA, 2007).

In comparison to the calculated Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 0.63 mg/kg bw/day for
melamine, the report confirms that (USFDA, 2007):

Figure 2.12: Microscopic images of crystals found in urine of affected pets (UOG, 2007) Subsequently, by adding melamine and cyanuric acid to samples of clean cat urine, University of Guelph Laboratory Services successfully produced insoluble crystals in vitro (Fig. 2.13) that
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) found to be consistent with those found in the urine of affected cats (UOG, 2007).

In light of the calculation that the highest estimate of exposure (i.e., 2.5 ug/ kg bw/day
for a 60 kg individual) is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the TDI (0.63 mg

per kg per day), which are (sic) based on reasonable assumptions and a 100-fold safety factor, the consumption of pork, poultry, eggs and domestic fish is very unlikely to pose a
human health risk.

Similar risk assessments and toxicological studies were preformed at various animal research facilities in Canada, the United States and Europe to determine the associated health implications
to dogs and cats eating pet foods containing VPPs polluted with melamine and its analogues
(UOG, 2007; UCD, 2007; AVMA, 2007; MSU, 2007; AAVLD, 2007; EFSA, 2007).

combination of melamine and cyanuric acid has been linked to the acute renal failure in cats and dogs that have eaten the suspect pet foods... However, one area where the USFDA's conclusion was inconsistent with empirical findings was in its assumption that melamine and its analogues were to be present in equal levels of potency
(USFDA, 2007):

...Melamine and melamine analogues (cyanuric acid, ammelide and ammeline) are assumed to be of equal potency and will be referred to collectively in this assessment as melamine compounds (MC). While it is entirely possible that the analogues are more or less potent than the parent compound, melamine, we have no information that assesses the relative potency of the three analogues as compared to melamine; therefore, for the purpose of this interim assessment, we have made an assumption of equal potency...
As discussed above, this does not appear to be the case, with cyanuric acid frequently

Cyanuric Acid has been shown to pose no risks to human health at concentrations of 20-25 mg per liter, a pH within 7.2-7.7, along with free available chlorine concentrations in the range of

kg and higher. Cyanuric acid supplementation in rat and mice studies caused bladder stones and associated complications at 700 mg/kg and 2,200 mg/kg, respectively (Hammond et al,
1986).Comparatively, a 50 kg human ingesting 100 ml of water, with a concentration of 25 mg per liter of cyanuric acid would ingest less than 1/100,000 that LD50 amount (Canelli, 1974;
Mazaev, 1964).

A study conducted within the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory of the UC

Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, further confirmed that incidences of acute renal failure
occurred only when both melamine and cyanuric acid were present together (Puschner etal, 2007). Concentrations within the kidneys were as follows: 496 to 734 mg/kg wet weight of

lead to extensive renal trauma within 12 hours of consuming tainted samples. Those cats were
euthanized within 48 hours due to an impossibility of reversing those deleterious effects. Although the LD50 was not determined, histopathologic findings included "crystals primarily

crystallization and acute renal failure in cats (Puschner et al, 2007).

.. .It has been hypothesized that melamine may interact synergistically with its three analogues, but no studies have been conducted that specifically test this hypothesis. Very preliminary work suggests that if it does occur, the formation of lattice crystals, particularly between melamine and cyanuric acid, takes place at very high dose levels and is a threshold and concentration dependent phenomenon that would not be relevant to low levels of exposure. Although still under investigation, it now appears that the

Hypotheses from the literature suggest that bacterial or photocatalytic degradation might explain the presence of melamine and cyanuric acid in tainted VPPs, helping to explain how both compounds might be present despite the initial inclusion of only one of them. Another possibility has been identified by El-Sayed et al. (2006) who isolated novel bacterial Micrococcus sp. strain MF-1 that was capable of metabolizing melamine formaldehyde resin as a main carbon and nitrogen source. Biodegradation sequences (Fig. 2.14) revealed general triazine catabolism of melamine, followed by successive deamination, resulting in the formation of cyanuric acid. Decarboxylation produced biuret, which hydrolyzed to produce urea and ammonia, a characteristic of melamine degradation (Cook, 1987; Eaton & Karns, 1991; Wackett et al,
2002).

Literature reviews that followed in the months subsequent to the pet food recalls of 2007 revealed that similar instances of fraudulent melamine use were in fact reported by Italian scientists at levels as high as 56% of
fish feed samples analyzed (Cattaneo and Cantoni, 1982).

2.3.1.1. MRS

Near-infrared reflectance (NIRR) technologies have been used extensively in quality assessments of VPPs since the early 1970s. Due to their fast, non-destructive, reproducible and accurate
results, the Canadian Grain Commission's Grain Research Laboratory (GRL) employed NIRR

methods that could be carried out at terminal elevators on individual railcars carrying commodity

loads (Williams, 1998). By the mid-1980s near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) became widely applied throughout agricultural and food production sectors. Based on the distinctive
reflection spectra produced by samples exposed to light within a range of 700 to 2500 nm, fast and accurate information could be obtained relating to nutrient composition and digestibility

(Murray & Hall, 1983; Murray & Williams, 1987; Murray, 1992; Osborne etal, 1993; van
Kempen etal., 1997; Williams, 1999; Deaville & Flinn, 2000; Cozzolino etal, 2002).

Fundamental to the success of these processes is the proper calibration of NIRS instrumentation,

Extensively used today in agricultural, drug testing and environmental sectors, GC/MS principles rely on the behaviour of various compounds within a sample after being vaporized by the instrument. Factors affecting the speed at which a compound will travel through the GC column include its volatility and
polarity. Unique spectral peaks are captured by the MS which measures the time elapsed between initial injection and elution, known as the retention time. Spectrograph peak-size is

cyromazine and melamine. Additional work by Yokley and Cheung (2000) employed GC techniques to determine cyromazine and melamine residues in soil samples.

MRS calibrated nutritive evaluations were performed on various species including ruminants,
swine, poultry and rabbits (Aufrere etal, 1996; Park etal, 1997; Givens & Deaville, 1999; Van

considered, (Tswett, 1903; Martin & Synge, 1941; Arpino& Guiochon, 1982; Cairns, 1983;

Gas chromatography presents several limitations, most notably that it is heavily temperature

dependent, requiring thermally stable, volatile compounds. Consequently, in the context of monitoring VPPs for melamine and its analogues, gas chromatography presents significant
challenges.

Based on analysis by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, Mamone
et al. (2000) developed a new method for fast and sensitive fingerprinting of gliadins and

From the outset, in preparing samples for the gas chromatograph, the sample must first undergo a process of extraction into an organic solvent. As discussed above, the USFDA's methanol extract

quantitative information about wheat gluten proteins to provide gluten in diets selected for celiac patients (Mamone et al., 2000).

Following the work of Rossi et al. (2002), Potter et al. (2001) and Rutherford et al. (2001),

California at Davis released methods for the determination of melamine in porcine muscle tissue
(Filigenzi et al, 2007). Using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) the authors achieved a mean

Zhang et al. (2004) used robotic liquid-handling technologies in high throughput LC-MS/MS assays to quantify a new bone integrin antagonist in human plasma and urine with great success. Similarly, Patel and Jones (2007) applied LC/MS methods for the quantitative determination of cyanuric acid as the degradation product of sodium dichloroisocyanurate in urine samples.

recovery for the seven replicates tested of 83% with a 6.5% relative standard deviation and a calculated method detection limit of 1.7 ng/g (1.7 PPB). Quantitative determinations of melamine concentrations in tissue samples were attained using a triple stage quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Filigenzi et al, 2007). Clear advantages of solid phase extraction (SPE) versus

LC/MS/MS screenings for melamine and cyanuric acid follow the same rationale, but because of the nature of the compounds, require different extractions and clean-up protocols due to the
molecular structures of the two; one is a basic compound and the other is an acidic compound. Hence, although independent analyses must be run at different times, the ultimate analysis of the
extract is nonetheless still LC/MS/MS.

liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) have been identified and as such were using in the experimental design of this study: less solvent is required, analysis times are shorter and working products are
more amenable to automation (Zhao et al, 1994). Further inefficiencies with LLE have been
documented by Dufresne et al. (2001).

Since liquid chromatography is not performed in the gas phase but rather at ambient temperature
and in a liquid phase, the extraction process is much simpler than in gas chromatography (Glad

In consultation with University of Guelph scientist Dr. Martos, Filigenzi et al. (2007) used a mobile phase of ammonium acetate/acetic acid and acetonitrile to prevent carryover in the HPLC/MS/MS system. This eliminated the frequent melamine contamination in blank analyses.
Melamine was extracted in 50% acetonitrile in water (Filigenzi, 2007).

and Grubb, 1978; Cairns et al, 1983; Croley, 2000). By gradually adding water to a methanol
extraction, the solubility of melamine in methanol is increased, iniproving its tendency to release from the sample into the liquid phase (Aurand, 2007). Moreover, extracting a contaminant of interest from a given sample into a medium, whether aqueous or organic, becomes easier when applied to the liquid chromatograph as it doesn't degrade as quickly as in a gas chromatograph. A clear advantage of liquid chromatography: one can simply inject an extracted sample onto the
liquid chromatograph, clean out interferences, and simply identify the compound using the
tandem MS/MS (Aurand, 2007; QUASU, 2007).

The precursor ion for melamine was identified at m/z 127. Collision-induced dissociation (CID)
product ions (Fig 2.20) of melamine were consistent with those previously reported by Ju et al.
(1999): m/z 85 and 68 (Filigenzi, 2007).

Additionally, LC/MS/MS provides both the identification as well as the quantitative information
required. The GC/MS screen on the other hand involves a difficult extraction followed by a
simple positive or negative result that requires an additional LC/MS/MS or HPLC-UV step to then identify the compound in the end.

2.3.1.7. LC/MS/MS: CFIA

Similar techniques were applied by Pena etal. (2006) who investigated the role of tyrosine-rich
crosslinks in the formation of the gluten networks in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) dough.

From May to June of 2007, the CFIA released 3 methods using Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS): 1. The Determination of
Melamine; 2. The Screening for Cyanuric Acid; 3. The Determination of Melamine and

without providing any data or demonstrations from actual runs (CFIA, 2007c-e).

deproteinization techniques for HPLC amino acid analysis in pork muscle and dry-cured ham, amino acid profiling requires a more complex extraction process than standard LC systems.

Sample extraction took place in acetonitrile and water. In line with the USFDA, reporting levels
were set at 10 ng/g (PPM), with an analytical range of 10-20000 PPM (CFIA, 2007c-e).

Fekkes (1996) applied various pre-column derivatization techniques involving o-

phthaldialdehyde for primary amino acids in plasma, and phenylisothiocyanate for secondary

amino acids and cystine. The authors confirmed that HPLC methods were capable of separating

over forty physiological amino acids, lending support to their use in the analysis of urine samples
(Fekkes, 1996).

To avoid the now well-established danger of presuming the total nitrogen content in a standard crude protein analysis could be the summation of only a sample's protein, amino acid and peptide groups, amino acid profiling has become a critical component in developing suitable monitoring programs for vegetable protein products. Amino acid analyzers are essentially highly sophisticated liquid chromatographs: High Performance Liquid Chromatographs (HPLC). Used extensively in pharmaceutical drug and physiological testing, amino acid profiling by means of
HPLC technology has been applied to the food sciences as well.

Hence, in HPLC analyses, amino acids must first be cleaved in a 3 step process of hydrolysis to break off all of the amino acids from the parent protein. From there, a carbonyl derivative must

be formed in order for the amino acids to be amenable to successive analysis. Reverse phase C18
columns with 254-nm UV are commonly employed for that analysis and are the key to the qualification process of raw materials coming in. In order to discern that a certain percentage of
protein is genuinely coming from a given vegetable protein, and was not adulterated with

For instance, Pastorello et al. (2000) determined that the major allergen responsible for foodinduced allergic reactions in maize was a lipid transfer protein. The allergen identified was purified by HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry, determination of the isoelectric point value, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Pastorello et al, 2000). Wieser and Kieffer (2001) analyzed amino acid profile of a-gliadines from different wheat species in an effort to isolate those sequences potentially toxic for celiac patients (Wieser and Kieffer, 2001; Wieser et al,
1998).

compounds like melamine or cyanuric acid, amino acid profiling is vital to the qualification
process.

Hence LC/MS/MS technologies coupled with HPLC-UV-driven amino acid profiling provide an
excellent monitoring system for both the qualification of protein samples, as well as the determination of melamine and its analogues.

Other advantages of combining the two methods were identified by Mamone et aL (2000). In analyzing wheat gluten proteins by HPLC combined with standard liquid

CFIA testing of all such products for the presence of melamine began, along with thorough
tracking investigations to determine which materials made their way into Canada.

On June 4, 2007, a compliance verification strategy was implemented, requiring importers of vegetable protein products to "demonstrate that their imports are free from melamine and cyanuric acid (free from melamine and cyanuric acid means that neither chemical is detected at a level of 10 mg per kg or greater)" in order to pass into Canada for use "in or as food or livestock
feed" (CFIA, 2007e).

of HPLC-UV is the most effective stand-alone quality-assessment-tool for VPP protein-contentdetermination.

2.3.3. Experimental Hypothesis & Objective

Although LC/MS/MS technologies have been widely applied in the design of monitoring systems intended for critical toxicological pathways in the environmental, few have targeted the
argi-food chain as a point source of contamination. The widespread food recalls of 2007 clearly demonstrate that greater attention is required in this area, along with the firm recognition that NIRS-screening for nitrogen is a false assurance of overall nutritive protein value, and can no longer be regarded as a complete quality assurance program for such measures. Selecting accurate, efficient and cost-effective tools for the monitoring of environmental contaminants

entering via the food-web thus poses a considerable challenge. The formal recommendations and
legislative support of the CFIA might be sufficient for the identification of melamine and its

analogues, but is precariously limited in its ability to effectively assure a quality product where
there is no a priori knowledge of the toxin(s) involved. Therefore it is crucial that new

techniques or new combinations of techniques that are best suited to the enhancement of safety
programs be investigated.

In light of these challenges, this study explored a number of analytical techniques currently being employed in Canadian food safety laboratories to assess and furthermore assure the quality of VPPs: GC/MS, LC/MS/MS, MRS and HPLC-UV. The overall goal was to provide an analytical
framework from which recommendations could be made attesting to the empirical methods most

To elute the melamine from the sorbent in the solid phase, 4 ml of 5% ammonium hydroxide in

3.6. LC/MS/MS/MS Analysis

Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) required that after 22 samples, a spike was analyzed to
ensure that quality control criteria were being met (i.e. nothing changed throughout the course of the run (i.e. signal, retention time, etc.)). For large runs where the possibility of drift of signal
could occur, the curve would be analyzed both at the beginning of the run and at the end of the run. For runs with fewer than 10 samples, only one calibration curve was analyzed and spikes
were placed before and after the sample.

Analysis of raw material and finished good samples was performed using a LC/MS/MS
instrument (API 4000 MDS/Sciex Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) coupled to a LC pump and degasser (Agilent 1100; Agilent, CA, USA),

with an autosampler (MPS; Gerstel Inc., MD, USA). Analysis of melamine and aminopterin was simultaneously performed, while cyanuric acid was determined in an independent analysis with different extraction and analysis conditions.

3-6.1. Melamine & Aminopterin analysis
For all samples, a matrix blank sample was included leveling each run. Six matrix calibration standards were included in the analysis run along with 2 quality control samples (S7 & S7A). Spikes were essentially the same as the standards: duplicates of the lowest range of 500 ppb
(Table 3.3). In large runs additional Quality Controls were prepared and these would be
staggered throughout the run.

Separation was performed by a Primesep AB (Sielc, IL, USA) reverse-phase column with
embedded acidic and basic ion-pairing groups, with isocratic elution of 32.5% 25 mM
ammonium acetate + 0.3% formic acid for mobile phase A and 67.5% acetonitrile for mobile

phase B. A standard buffer of ammonium acetate with formic acid helped ionize the compounds
and achieved decent retention with a good peak shape on the column.

Of the 21 NIRS-prescreened raw material samples, as well as the 19 NIRS-prescreened dry and

In the interest of consistency with the USFDA GC/MS method in March of 2007, reporting
levels were set at >10 PPM.

3.9. Outsourced HPLC-UV Amino Acid Profiling

Quantitative data returned a high level of confidence, witK satisfactory reproducibility.
Due to the significant levels of contamination found in samples of Rice Protein Concentrate (RPC), additional analyzes were performed on Dry-Food-Rice-Protein-Concentrate-11

Acceptable calibration curves (i.e. Fig 4.1) were a linear fit, not forced through zero, with correlation coefficients of 0.9878 or greater. Where required, 1 / (x*x) weighting was used to improve the accuracy of reporting at lower concentrations. At least 6 standards were used to
define each curve.

(DFRPC11), whose RPC-source was traced to Asian supplier "RPC-Supplier-1." Amino acid

profiling by means of HPLC-UV1 was outsourced at a facility better equipped for the analyses.

Accuracy was measured through % recovery (%RV) of fortified standards 1-6, ranging from 500
ppb to 5000 ppb, along with 1-2 additional quality controls (Spk 1 & Spk 1 A), depending on the

sample. Concentrations that exceeded the highest reference standard were diluted with blank matrix. No contaminants were found in method blanks or rinses. Typical %RV values were between 96 and 102%. Signal-to-noise (STN) ratios were high, ranging from 3.95:1 at the lowest
levels (blanks/rinses) up to 477000:1.

Overall, MEL was identified in 22 of the 49 test-runs at concentrations above 1 PPM (Table

4.1). Calibrations curves over the range of 500 to 5000 ppb displayed high levels of accuracy (90-130%). Only 2 samples (Wet-Food-Wheat-Gluten-4 (WFWG4) & Wet-Food-Wheat-Gluten-

5 (WFWG5)) were identified at levels above 1000 PPM, containing 1120 PPM and 1090 PPM of MEL, respectively. These concentrations did not exceed the LD50 of 3161 PPM in rats, yet did

slightly exceed the reproductive and developmental toxicity no-observed-adverse-effect-levels

(NOAELs) of 1060 mg/kg bw/day identified in orally administered fetal rats and 400 mg/kg

bw/day in maternal rats (USFDA, 2007; IUCLID, 2000; OECD, 2002). Whether these findings
might be extrapolated to human health is debatable, as no metabolism or tissue accumulation of melamine has been demonstrated in mammals. Of concern however is the fact that these levels

did also exceed the concentration of MEL found in the kidneys of autopsied cats, 496 to 734

77

PPM. Furthermore, the overall risk to the environment remains unknown, especially when found

Additionally, the confirmed presence of MEL along with CYA contamination in this study confirmed that the source of initial pollution was not pure MEL altogether, but rather its wastestream of analogues. This fact further highlights the degree of immorality and foolhardiness in which those individuals responsible for such criminal acts engaged for financial gain.

in combination with CYA. Being cognizant of the 2007 food recalls and the magnitude of the 60,000,000 containers of wet food alone that were disposed of and destroyed, a multi disciplinary investigation is required to elucidate the multifarious effects of the complex biochemical
pathways of MEL released into local ecosystems.

Consistent with previous findings by the USFDA (2007) and University of Cornell (2007), APT was not found in any samples tested at levels above 1 PPM, lending further support to the theory suggesting that its initial suspected role was nothing more than an artifact of analytical limitations associated with GC.

these matrix enhancement effects, providing statistically significant results. Results displayed in bold (i.e. RMRPC1, RMRPC7, etc.) represent columns that may have been overloaded by such
residues, possibly leading to lower results being obtained. In those cases actual MEL and/or
CYA concentrations may be higher than reported.

Of the 33 CYA analyses completed, 17 tested positive^ at levels exceeding 1 PPM. RawMaterial-Rice-Protein-Concentrate-7 (RMRPC7) was the only sample that exceeded

contamination levels of 5000 PPM with a recovery of 5400 PPM. Indeed those levels did exceed the LD50 for rats, which was assessed at 750 PPM, as well as the no-risk-to-human health level
of 20-25 mg per liter of water (Canelli, 1974). As with MEL, more research into the potential

PPM. Of those RPC samples assessed, 3 tested positive for both MEL and CYA (Table 4.2). Where both compounds were present, CYA was found in significantly larger proportions than MEL. In RMRPC7 for instance, CYA levels (5400 PPM) were 524 times greater than MEL (10.3

79

PPM). These findings were consistent with reports by the American Veterinary Medical
Association (AVMA) that also observed higher CYA concentrations, albeit to a lesser extent:
MEL:CYA (30:70 v/v) (AVMA, 2007).

However, as Puschner et al. (2007) demonstrated, concentrations as low as 32 mg/kg each of MEL and CYA were shown to cause renal crystallization in cats. Hence, herein lies a great opportunity for further research into the toxicological factors leading up to and surrounding the
formation of such renal-blocking fan-shaped birefringent MEL-CYA lattice crystals.

The most pronounced deviation was observed in a raw RPC sample obtained from RPC Supplier

MRS, representative of a total N-content of 11.20% (N x 6.25). Conversely, subsequent HPLCUV analysis revealed a total amino acid content of 12%, a significant digression from the
expected 70%.

the sample labeled as RPC was in fact closer in composition to rice flour than anything else and
consequently was not a VPP altogether.

Looking at the actual costs associated with the above-mentioned instrumentation, the reasoning
behind customary industry method-selection becomes clear. With a MRS system running in the

A LC/MS/MS system such as the API 3000, 4000 or 5000, is considerably more costly, being offered in a $300,000-$500,000 USD range. As a consequence, most companies are forced to
outsource samples to independent laboratories. Associated costs are cheaper short-term, but can

In a similar light, HPLC systems capable of amino acid analysis such as the Waters KiloPrep 250

Tandem MS/MS capability can bring the system cost up to and above the $500,000 mark. For that reason, few private laboratories possess the capital to bring these units in-house and often outsource amino acid profiles at $165-$400 per test (GMI,

Moreover, at the levels of contamination identified in DFRPCl 1 (8.6 PPM & 3270 PPM),
nitrogen contributions from MEL and CYA accounted foE 0.036% and 0.665% of the protein

exemplary for this task, capable of directly and single-handedly evaluating the requirement for
additional steps such as the identification and/or quantification of a particular contaminant by means of LC/MS/MS/MS.

The food recalls of 2007 adumbrated the erroneous proclivity with which analytical modus
operandi such as NIRS technologies have been commonly applied to agri-food quality assurance

programs. Indeed their beneficial applications in food safety programs remain unquestionable, when applied correctly, monitored closely and effectively calibrated on a regular basis. What can no longer be accepted however is the assumption that nitrogen-protein determination by NIRS is sufficiently representative of the totality of a sample's quality. With that in mind, the methods
employed in this study were successful in providing auxiliary tools, whose reliability and time-

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented herein, LC/MS/MS/MS, in combination with
HPLC-UV provides for a reliable food safety monitoring program as applied to VPPs. HPLC-

UV is indispensable as a stand-alone first level of screening to assess the integrity of a VPP or any nutritive protein-based sample. Future research and development is required to bring the
associated instrumentation costs down to a level where they can be adopted on a widespread

sensitive efficiencies were conducive to the on-going monitoring of VPPs for the presence of
MEL and its analogues. In this context LC/MS/MS/MS was highly robust, enabling a similar work-up process to be applied to both MEL and CYA with only a slight shift in extraction techniques. LC by itself was a powerful identification tool, while the tandem MS/MS/MS

manner are further questions deserving great attention.

allowed for fast and precise quantification. By comparison, GC/MS has been shown to be quite
limited here, posing operational difficulties and reporting constraints, despite its considerably
cheaper operating costs.

Finally, the federal government, in collaboration with the CFIA and its key associations, must implement the proper programs to not only require the instatement of approved quality programs,
but the legislative authority to monitor compliance with strength and power of enforcement. In

All too often governing bodies such as the CFIA and the USFDA are forced to react to crises in
an ad hoc manner, without even the requisite prescience to do so efficiently. The mass food
recalls of 2007 were clearly indicative of this constraint. In order to better avoid these situations

essence, Canadian authorities need to agree on a combined approach of command-and-control and economic incentive programs for food safety abatement policies. Hopefully the proposed Food and Consumer Safety Action Plan (FCSAP) will deliver this type of change, in the vanguard of North American food safety and environmental protection legislation. Without these tools and information systems in place, the future integrity and sustainability of the food-web is in great jeopardy, as is the heavily reliant environmental and economic infrastructures that surround it. This issue extends to the most serious levels of public health, with great consequences to sensitive populations, especially for children.

in the years ahead, proper tools must be in place to promote preparedness. In this study amino acid analysis by means of HPLC-UV proved to be an invaluable component to any VPP food
safety program. Despite a more complicated sample work-up process prior to analysis than

experienced with a standard LC/MS/MS/MS, HPLC-UV was duly able to provide critical quality
information where other methods could not. Unequivocally, HPLC-UV was the only tool
investigated capable of qualifying a raw material without any a priori understanding of a given
adulteration. Knowing after the fact that some of raw materials tested above were not VPPs

altogether, and that the contaminants were not pure in themselves, highlights the need for a broader scope in how nutritive protein sources are monitored for safety. Moreover, with the majority of the nitrogen content in the samples tested still unaccounted for, it is clear that further research is required. For this reason the author recommends the prompt adoption of this tool in
nationwide industry-standard protein-assessment quality assurance programs. HPLC-UV is
