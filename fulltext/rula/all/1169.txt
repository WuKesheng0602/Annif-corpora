Abstract
BIOSORPTION OF Cd2+ AND Cu2+ ONTO WHEAT STRAW USING BATCH AND CONTINUOUS FIXED..BED COLUMN SYSTEMS

Toronto~

2008

Biosorption of Cd+2 and Cu2+ by wheat straw (Triticum Sativun1) using a batch system and a continuous upflow mode in a fixed bed colun1n was studied. For the batch system, the effect of pH over a range frotn 3.0 to 7.0 and the temperature from 20 to 40 °C on the metal removal was investigated. Various initial metal concentrations frotn 20 to 150 mg/L were used. Adsorption of metal ions was observed to increase with liquid pH and tetnperature. Among the three widely used isotherms, namely the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Timken models, the experimental data better fitted the Langmuir isotherm model.

For the continuous upflow n1ode in a fixed bed (4-inch diameter), experiments were performed over a range of flow rate from 0.3-1.0 LPM and varied bed height of 0.5-2.0 m. The results obtained also agree (BDST) n1odel. In addition for estimations of the

paratneters that are necessary for the design of a fixed bed adsorber in practical application, the experimental data were fitted to the Thomas, Adams-Bohart, Yan, and Yoon-Nelson models. Thomas model appeared to describe the experimental results well. Mathen1atical model was developed to simulate the concentration changes at the experimental time instances

Introduction

Water pollution is a major concern all over the world. The rate at which water is being polluted on an everyday basis is the primary reason for the extensive attention given it by researchers the world over. Many factors contribute to water pollution, with the main contributor being industrial growth. With respect to industrial water pollution with heavy metals, the potential damage to humans and animals cannot be ignored. The most harmful metals listed by the USEPA (1978) are: antitnony (Sn), arsenic (As), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), thallium (Th), and zinc (Zn) (Kumar et al., 2006).

Industrial wastewater from the autotnotive industry normally contains many kinds of pollutants, which require more than one method of treatment. Conventional n1ethods for removing heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions range from chemical precipitation to ion exchange, electrochemical treatment, membrane technologies, adsorption onto activated carbon, etc. With cost factors high, the search for new and cheaper tnethods of treatment are under way.

In developing countries, increased environmental pollution and the accompanying increased threat to wildlife result from the discharge, either directly or indirectly, of contaminated water containing heavy metal ions into the environment. The increase in contaminated water is one of the sacrifices n1ade by developing countries for rapid industrial development. Many industries are responsible, including those engaged in the mining and smelting of metalliferous n1aterials, energy and fuel production, surface finishing, leatherworking, photography, fertilizer and pesticide production, metallurgy, iron and steel production, electroplating, electrolysis, electro-osmosis, electric appliance manufacturing, metal surface treatment, and aerospace and atomic energy installations (Wang and Chen, 2006) Canada is home to many sites of contamination due to mining.

1

Introduction There are approximately 3 million tons of tailings in the tnining area of Goldenville, Nova Scotia containing an estitnated 470 kg of cadn1ium, 37,300 kg of lead, 6800 kg of mercury, and 20,700 kg of arsenic (Wong et al., 1999). In a lake downstream of the mine (Lake Gagogan), the stream water and sediments are toxic to the benthic organisms, and populations of benthic invertebrates were drastically lower than those found in similar waters upstream.

Unlike organic pollutants, heavy metals are nonbiodegradable and hence are accun1tllated in living organisn1s through their food chains. Some metals, such as Cd, Hg, Ag, and Pb, can be extremely toxic for the cycle of living beings. Others, such as Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Co, are essential for plants and animals in sn1all quantities; but when present in concentrations above certain limits, can be very harn1ful to living organisms (Malkoc, 2006). Toxic heavy tnetal contaminants in aqueous waste streams have caused serious water pollution problems that are being faced over the world (Dundar et al., 2008).

The characteristics of heavy metals and their toxicity are: · · The toxicity of heavy 1netals can be very long lasting in nature; Some heavy metals can be transformed frotn species of relatively low toxicity into more toxic forms in certain environments (mercury is one example); · The bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the food chain can damage normal physiological activity in wildlife and eventually endanger hun1an life; · Metals can be transformed only in valence and species, but cannot be degraded by any tnethod, including biotreatment; · Toxicity from heavy metals occurs even at low concentrations of about 1.0-10 tng/L. Some strongly toxic n1etal ions, such as Hg and Cd ions, are very toxic even at lower concentrations of 0.001-0.1 mg/L (Volesky, 1990 a; Wang and Chen, 2006).

The treatment strategies for wastewater contaminated by heavy metals are now shifting from the use of conventional adsorbents to the use of biosorbents, In recent years many low cost sorbents such as algae, fungi, bacteria, and agricultural lignocellulose by1

Introduction

products have been investigated for their biosorption capacity for the heavy metals. In this study the biosorbent capacity of an agricultural by-product for two toxic tnetal ions, Cd2+ and Cu2+, was investigated. The parameters by which the sorption process is quantified and evaluated, using isotherm models, were compared for heavy metal removal using a batch system. For the fixed-bed column system study, four sets of models were investigated with experimentally obtained heavy metal removal data. Furthermore, a physical model was developed to simulate n1etal concentration profiles with respect to titnes obtained from experimental study.

2. 1 Wastewater treatment methods
There are many methods and processes that have been devised for the treatment of industrial wastewater, such as filtration, settling ponds, biological oxidation, electroflotation, and electro-winning. The importance of removing heavy metals from water requires looking at the rate of wastewater produced every day from industrial development in the world. The following are the water treatment methods most commonly used for removal of heavy metals:

P.. Electrical treatment
~

Chemical precipitation

).;;- Ion exchange
~
~

Membrane processes Activated carbon adsorption

The above mentioned methods are used all over the world. All of these 1nethods have advantages and disadvantages. The most efficient 1nethod in one geographical place could be at the bottom of the list in another place, depending upon the regulations and available methods. Brief descriptions of these methods are given below.

2. 1. 1 Electrical treatment
Using electricity to treat water was first proposed in the UK in 1889. Electro-coagulation of drinking water was first applied on a large scale in the US in 1946 (Sittig, 1969). However, because of the large capital investment required and the high cost of the electricity required, electrochemical methods (electro-deposition and electro-coagulation) 3

Chapter 2

Theoretical Background

did not find wide application worldwide in the past. However, with ever increasing standards for drinking water supplies and ever more stringent environmental regulations regarding wastewater discharge, and with the continuous development of new techniques for achieving more efficient n1etal removal, electrochemical technologies have gained more extensive use worldwide during the past two decades.

In general, during the last two decades, much research has been devoted to the protection of the environment; and this includes, for instance, limiting wastewater discharge into sutface water (lakes, rivers, and oceans) and decreasing the disposal of solid waste into land sites.

Electrochemical recovery of metals can be used to treat wastewater. However, its potential to be a complete solution to wastewater problems is lin1ited, as it cannot be used to treat all n1etals, either technically or economically (Sittig, 1969). This treatn1ent technique involves two main steps: the collection of heavy metals and the stripping of the collected metals. The basic principle of the electrochemical deposition mechanism is based on two half cell reactions in an oxidation-reduction electrochemical cell. The electrochemical cell consists of electrodes (a cathode and an anode), an electrolyte, wiring, and a load. The electrode surface is where heterogeneous reactions take place. During this process negative ions release electrons at the anode while positive ions receive the electrons at the cathode (Chen, 2004), and thus the removal process goes on. Following are some of the advantages of the electrochetnical methods:

1. Elimination of the sludge that is generated by some of the other methods. The

disposal of sludge is normally performed by specialized environmental con1panies, which simply means extra cost plus additional environmental problems to take care of in the future. 2. The possibility of recovering the pure metals that are deposited on the cathode. Electro-coagulation is one of the electrical treatments that involve the generation of coagulants in situ by electrically dissolving either alutninum ions or iron ions from aluminum electrodes or iron electrodes, respectively. The metal ion generation takes

place at the anode; hydrogen gas is released from the cathode. The hydrogen gas helps to make the flocculated particles float on the surface of the water (this process is sometimes called electroflocculation). The electrode can be arranged in a monopolar or bipolar mode. The materials can be aluminum or iron in plate form or packed form of scrap metal such as steel turnings. The advantages of electro-coagulation include (Chen, 2004):

1. High particulate removal efficiency

2. A compact treatment facility 3. Relatively low cost and the possibility of complete automation

2ole2 Chemical precipitation
The retnoval of heavy metals by precipitation is based on the low solubility of heavy metal co1npounds. During the precipitation process, a basic solution (of high pH) is mixed with the wastewater that contains the heavy metals. The resulting heavy metal hydroxide precipitates are insoluble or have very low solubility and thus are precipitated. In order to precipitate heavy metals sometimes wastewater is n1ixed with H2S, thus
9

converting the heavy metals into insoluble metal sulfides that are separated fron1 the wastewater using separation techniques such as sedimentation or decantation. Generally, cationic metals can be easily separated from wastewater because of their tendency to form precipitates with hydroxides, but anionic n1etal complexes have to undergo more con1plicated high cost procedures such as reduction or organic complexation (Malkoc, 2006).

The continuous removal of heavy n1etals by ion exchange takes place in a fixed-bed column that is packed with cationic or anionic resins. The metals sorb onto the resins and exchange hydroxide anions, protons, or light metal cations, which are released into the

Theoretical Background

solution. An ion exchange system can perform both heavy metal removal and neutralization of acidic water (Rao et al., 2003).

2.1.4 Membrane processes
These processes involve application of pressure differentials across a semipermeable membrane to separate a solution into a concentrated and a more dilute (effluent) solution. In a recent study (Squires, 1992), it has been proved that this method is more efficient as compared to other tnethods such as precipitation. The use of a combination of membrane technology and n1etal bioaccumulation is also well known. Some advantages of using membrane processes for the removal of metal ions, as reported by Huang and Koseoglu ( 1993), include low energy requirements as compared to electrical processes, small volumes of retentate to be handled, and selective removal of pollutants through the use of complexing agents and biocatalysts or metnbrane surface modification. Some disadvantages include fouling of the membrane by slightly soluble components in the solution as well as fouling of metnbranes used for wastewater treatment by high concentrations of suspended solids (Meena et al., 2005).

2.1.5 Activated carbon adsorption
Activated carbon has been widely used for the retnoval of organic material present at low levels (usually less than 1,000 mglL) in contaminated liquids as well as for the ren1oval of inorganic material (e.g., metals). Activated carbon is relatively expensive (Lie, 2002). The process of n1etal removal using activated carbon often involves the use of multiple columns or tanks filled with carbon and operated in a series or in parallel configurations. Figure 2.1 is a schematic of column arrangetnents commonly used in treating contaminated solutions. The choice of the use of multiple columns in series or in parallel depends upon the sensitivity of the process. If the process is sensitive to residence time, then columns in a series arrangement may be used; whereas, for enhanced productivity, an arrangement in parallel may be used. The carbon bed depth should be high enough to remove all the metals fron1 the solution to the required concentration. 6

2.2 Biosorption
Biosorption is a new and promising treatment technology for the removal of heavy metals from especially dilute wastewater. In this process a certain type of inactive, dead biomass binds to and adsorbs heavy metals in aqueous solution. In contrast to the passive nature of biosorption, bioaccumulation occurs in living cells and is metabolically driven. Generally materials that have the ability to bind with and absorb pollutant metals are known as biomass. There are many types of biomass including bacteria, fungi, seaweed, and plants.
In the development of wastewater treatment methods, it has been recommended that

using inexpensive adsorbents for the treatment of wastewater is an important area in the 7

environn1ental sciences (Barrera et al., 2006). One of the greatest advantages of the biosorption method as a wastewater treatment method is the efficiency of biosorption of toxic heavy metals, which is well illustrated by its ability to decrease toxicity in wastewater to low enough levels to constitute it as drinking water quality in continuous flow biosorption columns with a range of 1-100 ppm. Another advantage is its usability within a wide range of solution pH values, pressures, and temperatures. The most significant advantage is the ability to regenerate the biosorbent and to recover the metals deposited in the biomass through the use of acid elution.

There are many different fonns of inexpensive, easily available and effective biosorbents such as tea factory waste (Malkoc and Nuhoglu, Y., 2006), waste acorns of the Tabor oak
(Quercus ithaburensis) (Malkoc et al., 2006), waste biomass of Sargassun1 spp. (Padilha

et al., 2005), eucalyptus bark (Sarin and Pant, 2006), Hevea Brasilienesis sawdust (Karthikeyan et al., 2005), oak sawdust (Argun et al., 2007), cone biomass of Thuja
orienta/is (Nuhoglu and Oguz, 2003; Malkoc, 2006), Araucaria angustifolia tree waste

(Lima et al., 2007), orange waste (P"'erez-Mar'tn et al., 2007), Cassia fistula waste (Hanif et al., 2007), activated n1bber wood sawdust (Kalavathy et al., 2005), chemically modified corncobs (Khan and Wahab, 2007), agricultural by-products of Lentinus edodes (Chen et al., 2006), nonliving microbial biomass (Dhakal et al., 2005), freshwater algae (Nuhoglu et al., 2002; Tuzun et
aL~

2005; Abu Al-Rub et al., 2006), and the biopolymers

of chitin and/or chitosan, which is extracted from the shells of crustaceans (Ngah et aL, 2004; Sun and Wang, 2006), aerobic granular sludge (Xu et al., 2006). All of these biomass products have been widely used as potential adsorbents for heavy tnetals.

In the field of biosorption, heavy metals are usually classified in the following three categories: toxic metals (such as Hg, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, As, Co, Sn, etc.), precious metals (such as Pd, Pt, Ag, Au, Ru, etc.) and radionuclides (such as U, Th, Ra, Am, etc.), whose specific weights are usually greater than 5.0 g/cm3 (Volesky, 1990a).

Drinking water contains certain amounts of cadmium and copper, which n1ay be higher when it is stored in tanks. Although these ions are essential to human health, at high 8

concentrations, they can cause health problems such as stomach cramps, skin irritation, respiratory disorders, protein metabolism, and damage to the pancreas. High exposure to heavy metal ions in the work environment can lead to a flu-like condition known as metal fever condition. Also, these ions can be dangerous to unborn and newborn infants. Table 2.1 gives some of the health effects of some heavy metals that can be found in the wastewater from the automotive industry.

One of the most important factors in wastewater treatment has always been the economic factor. Although there are many techniques available for treating contaminated water, a critical factor to consider is cost effectiveness. Although the operation costs of biosorption are less than those of other treatment methods, the selection of the particular biomass can further reduce the overall cost. The source of the biomass plays a vital role in the cost consideration.

Biomass can come from three main sources:

~ ~

Industrial waste which should be obtainable free of charge; Organisms that are easily available in large amounts in nature

Chapter 2

Theoretical Background

"? Organisms that grow rapidly and are cultivated or propagated especially for
biosorption purposes

Another inexpensive source of biomass, found in the oceans, are seaweeds, representing many different types of marine macroalgae (Kuyucak and Volesky, 1990). In addition, agricultural by-products can also be used as biotnass. Wheat straw is one of agriculture by-products that could be used as biomass for effective heavy metal separation from wastewater.

Differentiation between the utility of biosorption and conventionaltnethods of removal of heavy tnetals frotn wastewater is based on:

1. Low operating cost (Biosorption is more cost efficient.)

2. Minimization of the volume of chemical sludge to be disposed of (biosorption leaves less) 3. High efficiency in detoxification of very dilute effluents (Is it well suited for purification of wastewater with typical metal concentrations of 1-100 mg/L ?) 4. Metal selectivity potential (The metal biosorption capabilities of different types of biomass vary in selectivity of different tnetals.) These advantages have served as the primary incentives for developing full-scale biosorption processes to dean up heavy n1etals pollution.

2. 3 Application of biosorption
In addition to the advantages and cost effectiveness of biosorption as well as its being the more suitable option for heavy metal recovery, the biosorption process can be carried out in a continuous flow column system that is filled with properly selected and treated biomass on a larger scale, especially when treating solutions having low concentrations of heavy metals. Other water treatment processes, such as chemical precipitation and electrochemical treatment, are ineffective, especially at low metal ion concentrations of 1 to 100 n1g/L, and produce large amounts of

difficulties. Ion exchange, membrane technologies, and activated carbon adsorption processes are extren1ely expensive, and are thus not econotnically feasible on larger scales.

Literature Review

Removal of toxic heavy metal contaminants from industrial wastewater by biosorption has been proposed as a safe and cost effective process for the treatment of high volumes of low concentration metal solutions. Research on biosorption has revealed that it is a complex phenomenon due to binding of metallic species by the solid biosorbent through different sequestering processes. In the following sections different types of biotnass and tnechanisn1s of the biosorption process will be discussed in detail.

Biosorption is a process that utilizes inexpensive biomass to sequester toxic heavy metals from industrial wastewater. Biosorbents are prepared from biomass that is abundant in nature or waste bion1ass, such as algae, moss, fungi, or bacteria that are inactivated and usually prepared by washing with acid and/or bases before their final drying and granulation (Volesky, 1990). Simple cutting and/or grinding of the dry biomass may yield stable biosorbent particles (Fourest, 1993).

Although many biologicaltnaterials bind heavy n1etals, only those with sufficiently high metal binding capacity and selectivity for heavy metals are suitable for use in a full-scale biosorption process. The major challenge for the biosorption field was to select the most protnising types of biomass from an extremely large pool of readily available and inexpensive biomaterials. In this selection process a good number of biomass types have been tested to determine their tnetal binding capabilities under various conditions.

3. 1 Biomass types
The renewable character of biomass that ··grows" fueled directly or indirectly by sunshine, makes it an inexhaustible pool of chemicals of all kinds. The usability of certain types of renewable biotnass for not so usual or obvious applications is being 12

examined more and more by scientists. Availability is a major factor to be taken into account in selecting biomass for clean-up purposes. The economics of environmental remediation dictates whether the biomass must come from nature or whether it has to be a waste material. Seaweeds, molds, yeasts, bacteria, crab shells, among other kinds of biomass, have been tested for metal biosorption with very encouraging results (Regine and Volesky, 2000).

3.1.1 Seaweed
The macroscopic structures of seaweeds offer a convenient basis for the production of biosorbent particles that are suitable for sorption process applications (Yang and Volesky, 1999). From the literature it is clear that different types of seaweeds have the ability to sequester different types of metals (Suzuki et al., 2005). For example, nonliving seaweed biomass, particularly brown seaweeds, are highly effective, reliable, and easily available for the removal of metals, especially for the removal of cadmium (Fig. 3.1 A, B).

3 . 1e2 Yeasts and othe:r fungi
Another kind of highly metal-sorbing biomass is yeast. However, the most common yeast biomass (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is not usually a waste product, but a commercial commodity (lotus nutrient). Some chemical compounds of yeast cells can also act as ion exchangers with rapid reversible binding of cations. Volesky et al. (1993) worked on cadmium biosorption by Saccharontyces cerevisiae and demonstrated that this yeast was a reasonably potent biosorbent material for cadn1iun1. It has also been found that fungal biomass, for example of Penicillium chrysogenurn, can extract gold from a cyanide solution.

The main mechanism of gold biosorption involved anionic AuCN 2 species adsorption onto N-, P- or 0- containing functional groups on biomass through ion pairing (H+AuCN 2-) (Gosset et al., 1986). Son1e n1ucoralean fungi have shown intriguing metal biosorbent properties, particularly for uranium and thorium, in which different metal deposition patterns could be clearly distinguished. Niu and Volesky ( 1999) examined selected bacteria, algae, and the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum and found that gold biosorption fron1 cyanide solution is higher at lower pH values, indicating that in the uptake of anions, biosorbents may act as weak acid ion exchangers.

3e1 . 3 Bacteria
The evaluation of metal-sorbing properties of bacteria has aroused some controversy. Most of the experin1ents done with metals and bacteria have really concerned etabolically mediated bioaccumulation, while the basic principle of biosorption is he juse of dead biomass. According to Volesky and Holan ( 1995), the strong biosorbent behavior of a certain type of microbial biomass toward metallic ions is a function of the chemical makeup of the microbial cell. In fact, the biomass is dead and all cells are metabolically inactive. There is also much confusion in the methodology used and in the evaluation and expression of experimental data. The most relevant work on true bacterial biosorption

14

Chapter 3

Literature Review

was done by Brierleys ( 1990), who took the metal biosorption concept all the way to the commercial stage.

Fein et al. (1997) used Bacillus subtilis to examine the bacterium's interaction with Cd, Cu, Pb, and AI. Their results quantified not only the deprotonation constants for the important organic functional groups on the bacterial cell wall, but also the stability constants for adsorption of environmentally important metal species onto the individual sites. Bacterial cell walls are negatively charged under acidic pH conditions, and the cell waH's chemical functional groups display a high affinity for metal ions in solution.

3o2 Plant sorbents
Plant materials can also be considered as low cost adsorbents (Table 3.1). The uses of these materials for metal removal from aqueous media, including natural water and industrial wastewater, have been highlighted by Tee and Khan (1988). Activated carbons derived from plant n1aterials have been used adsorption as well

3.3 Biosorption mechanisms
The biosorption mechanism can be explained by the phenomena of adsorption (Wagner and Jula, 1981). In the biosorption process atoms and molecules are held together by cohesive forces that range in magnitude from strong valence bonds to weak van der Waals forces. The atoms and molecules in the interior of the solid are completely surrounded by each other; thus, their attractive forces are satisfied on all sides. These attractive forces that are on the surface can be satisfied only if other atoms or molecules become attached to the surface, giving rise to the phenomenon of adsorption.

Based on the work of Adams and Holmes ( 1935), to bind calcium and magnesium from wastewater onto woody fibers, the field of ion exchange was invented; and that leads us to the field of biosorption, which includes adsorption as one of the fundamental phenomena involved. Fig 3.2 below shows adsorption and ion exchange. Adsorption and desorption studies invariably yield information on the mechanism of metal biosorption: how is the metal bound within the biosorbent? This knowledge is essential for understanding the biosorption process, and it serves as a basis for quantitative stoichiometric considerations, which constitute the foundation of mathematical modeling of the process.

Figure 3. 2 Adsorption is different from ion exchange (Volesky, 2003)

Chapter 3

Literature Review

There are many mechanisms suggested in the literature for the uptake of metal ions by a biomaterial. The explanations of these mechanisms show that metal sequestration by different parts of the cell can occur via chemisorption through: complexation,

coordination, chelation of metals, and ion exchange; as well as via physical processes through: adsorption and inorganic microprecipitation (Volesky, 2003). Brief descriptions of all these mechanisms are given below.

3.3.1 Complexation
Complexation is defined as the formation of species by the association of two or more species. When one of the species is a metal ion, the resulting entity is known as a metal complex. Mononuclear complexes are formed between a metal ion and a number of anions, or ligands. As a general rule, the metal atom occupies a central position in a complex, as exemplified by the cobalt, platinum, and copper complexes shown in Fig 3.3. However, there are complexes known as polynuclear complexes, which contain more than one metal atom center. The metal-centered structure may carry a positive, negative, or zero charge (neutral), depending on the charge(s) and the number of anions involved (Volesky, 2003).

complexes

The tenn ligand has two different meanings. It is son1etimes attPUeato the particular atom in a molecule by tneans of which the rnolecule is tral metal aton1,

e.g., the nitrogen atom in amn1onia; or it may be applied to the molecule as a whole. Where there is a risk of ambiguity, it may be avoided by using the term ligand atotn or donor aton1 to denote the atom attached to a metal. Some ligands are attached to a metal atotn by more than one donor atom in such a manner as to form a heterocyclic ring of the kind found in the copper complex shown in Fig 3.3. This type of ring has been given a special name-chelate ring-and the molecule or ion from which it is fonned is known as a chelating agent or chelator. The process of forming a chelate ring is known as chelation (Volesky, 2003 ).

3e3 . 4 Ion exchange
Ion exchange is the interchange of ions which are formed by tnolecular or atomic species either losing or gaining electrons. The ion exchange properties of certain natural polysaccharides have been studies in detail, and it is well established that bivalent metal ions exchange with counter ions from active groups of polysaccharides such as alginic acid (ALG) (Volesky, 2003).

3.3.5 Adsorption
Adsorption is a process by which molecules adhere to solid surface. Note that the definition implies no mechanical aspects of the nature of the binding. The attraction may often be based on electrostatic charges. Negative adsorption is the adsorption of positive species by negative adsorption sites and vice versa for positive adsorption. While the term adsorption implies a surface phenomenon, the actual sequestration may take place based on either physical phenomena (physical adsorption) or through a variety of chemical binding means (chemisorption).

Physical adsorption is nonspecific. The forces attracting the molecules to the solid surface are relatively weak. The energy of activation for physical adsorption is usually no more than 1 kcal/gmol. Since the forces involved are weak the amount of physical adsorption decreases rapidly as the temperature is raised and is generally very small above the critical temperature of the adsorption component. Chemisorption is specific and involves forces much stronger than that of physical adsorption. According to Langmuir's pioneering work (1918), the adsorption molecules are held to the surface by valence forces of the same type as those occurring between atoms in molecules. The differences between chemisorption and physical adsorption are summarized in Table 3.2.

3.3. 6 Inorganic microprecipitation
Microprecipitation of metals results when the solubility of the sorbate reaches it limit. This may happen even due to local conditions (e.g., on or inside the sorbent), not necessarily in the bulk of the solution. These conditions may be created by local deviations in physical conditions, such as pH, or by the presence of materials frotn the biosorbent itself. When biosorption is studied, special attention should be paid to ensuring that the solubility limits are not exceeded even locally, because if they are, the metal will not be removed from solution by sorption but by precipitation. On the other hand, microprecipitation in the actual biosorption process could contribute a great deal to the overall metal removal efficiency, in a process whereby the metal microprecipitation is collected in the solid phase and thus itnmobilized and separated from the solution itself. In the flow-through sorption column arrangement, the column and its filling function as an in-depth filtration device. While this is good for the overall performance of the tnetal removal process, a different mechanism of sorbate collection and sequestration is at work. The mechanism would not n1atter all that tnuch when the process is being designed empirically. However, for studying the process, it is of relevance since the sorbate sequestration mechanism differs rather significantly (Volesky, 2003).

Any single or combination of the above metal-binding mechanisms may be functional to various degrees in immobilizing one or n1ore metallic species onto the biosorbent. Biosorption technology generally uses nonliving microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi and algae, which can take up toxic metal ions from wastewater. In this method, the uptake of heavy metal ions may occur by n1etal sequestering in the cellular structure and subsequent biosorption onto the binding sites in the cellular stn1cture. The cell walls of n1icroorganisms consist mainly of polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids that carry many functional groups, such as carboxylate, hydroxyl, sulfate, phosphate, and an1ino groups, which can bind metal ions (Tunali et al., 2005).

The ren1oval of metal ions by nonliving 1nicroorganisms, especially fungi, has received more attention than that by living cells. The real challenge in the field of biosorption is to 23

Chapter 3

Literature Review

identify the mechanism of metal uptake by biomass. One of the mechanisms involved in biosorption is the ion exchange process between protons and light metals as counter ions present in the biomass and heavy n1etal ions taken up frotn water. Biosorbents can be viewed as natural ion-exchange materials that primarily contain weakly acidic and basic groups on the surface. In the pH range 2.5-6.0, the binding of heavy n1etals is determined prhnarily by the dissociation degree of the weakly acidic groups.

Schneider et al. (200 1) suggested that heavy metals adsorb onto the dead biomass of tnany macrophytes through two mechanisms: specific ion exchange and simple surface precipitation, although it is not possible to differentiate between them based solely on sorption data. To evaluate the possible presence of an ion exchange process~ the chemical analysis of the solution was performed after the sorption process took place. No significant differences were observed in the metal exchange amounts while using multimetal or individual metal solutions (Miretzky et al., 2005).

304 Characteristics of biosorption
The metal binding depends not only on the given biosorbent but also on the type of the metal ion and its concentration, as well as other physicochemical factors such as the temperature of the present
solution~

pH, ionic strength, and ion interference by other metals

3. 4. 1 Effect of temperature
Temperature is an important paratneter that influences the biosorption process. Several research studies have investigated the effect of temperature as it influences the sorption process. The binding of cobalt (Co) onto brown algae (Ascophylhum noodosum) was observed by Kuyucak and Volesky ( 1989a). When the ten1perature increased from 4 to 23 °C, the binding of Co increased by 50-70%. When the temperature increased to 40 °C~ the binding increasing slightly. Temperatures of 60 °C or more led to loss in the sorption

Literature Review

capacity due to changes in the texture of the biomass. Kalavathy et al. (2005) found that by increasing the temperature from 20-40 °C, the biosorption capacity for Cu 2+ onto rubber wood sawdust decreased from 3.168 to 2.102 mg/g at the initial concentration of 20 mg/L. The increase in the uptake with increased temperature could be due to the increase in the energy of the system, which facilitates the attachment of the ions to the surface of the biomass cells, while the decrease of the uptake with further increase in temperature could be a result of the distortion of some sites of the cell surface available for metal sorption, or due to the increase in the desorption process that might occur at high temperatures. The decreases in Cu 2+ uptake by the microbial biomass at higher temperatures could also be related to the metabolic activity of the cell as reported by Norris and Kelly (1977).

In conclusion, for practical application of biosorption, a reasonably narrow temperature range can be expected to be optimal (Schiewer, 1996). Within this range, the effect of temperature is small as compared to other influencing factors.

3e4 . 2 Effect of initial pH

One of the very important factors in biosorption is solution pH. It affects the an1ount of heavy metal ions adsorbed by biomass. Due to the nature of the reaction between the cell wall and the metal ions, pH is considered to be the most important paratneter influencing the biosorption process (Tien, 2002). It has also been reported that the pH of sorbent suspensions affects the adsorption process when agricultural sorbents are used. Singh et al. ( 1993) studied the binding of Pb 2+ to chemically treated tea leaves and observed that the uptake of Pb 2+ increased fron1 5.5 mg/g at pH 2 to 77 tng/g at pH 6. Bhattachm·ya and Venkobachar (1984) obtained no cadmium uptake by crushed coconut shells at pH 3, while the uptake reached its maxin1um value at pH 10. On other hand, some researchers have reported a decrease in metal uptake with . an increase in the initial pH of the suspension. Biosorption of Cr6+ by Acacia arabica bm·k decreased from 9.25 mg/g at pH

25

Chapter 3

Literature Review

2 to 2.5 mg/g at pH 6.8. The higher sorption was attributed to chlorochromate con1plex anion (Cr0 3 Cl)- formation below pH 3 in the presence of hydrochloric acid (Singh et al.,
1994). Increasing the pH increased both the arnount and rate of cadmium removal from a

suspension of beech leaves, until it reached a maximum at pH 5, at \Vhich cadmium uptake decreased with increase in pH (Salin1 et aL, 1992).

The removal of metal ions by a polysaccharide was found to be highly dependent on pH. It increased in as narrow a pH range as 2-3 pH units, but never reached 100% because chemical precipitation was always avoided under the experimental conditions used. At any fixed pH, the effectiveness of removal for each metal ion is reflected in the percentage adsorption obtained. For exatnple, at pH 3.5, the order of removal efficiency was Pb 2+ > Cu 2+ > Zn 2+ > Cd2+ > Ni 2+ (Wang and Chen, 2006). More generally, by increasing the pH, the adsorption limits were reached for Pb 2+, Cu 2+, Zn 2+, Cd2+ , and Ne+ in this sequence. This affinity order holds for most pH values until pH 4.5, at \Vhich Cd2+ seemed to become adsorbed more quickly than Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ cations. In the case of Cu 2+, Zn 2+, and Cd2+ ions, the differences were small, while the high affinity of Pb 2+ for the adsorbent was confinned by its adsorption limits.

In most microorganisms, the biosorption capacity peaks around a pH range of 4.0-6.0. In studying Thioabacillus thiooxidans, a chemolithotrophic bacterium, Liu et al. (2003) found that the biosorption capacity was highest at a pH 6.0. Yan and Viraaghavan (2003) observed an inhibition in fungal biosorption activity below pH 4.0 for lead, zinc, cadmiun1 and nickel, and a maximum capacity occurring around pH 6.0. At a tetnperature of 25 °C, Ozer and Ozer (2002) found the optimum pH for biosorption by the yeast

Sacchannoyces cerevisiae to be 5.0 for both lead and nickel ions.

3. 4. 3 Initial metal concentration·effect
The uptake rate of the metal ion will increase along with increasing the initial concentration if the amount of biomass is kept unchanged. Contrary to that, biosorptive capacity of the metal ions is inversely proportional to the initial concentration of the 26

Literature Review

biomass when the initial concentration of tnetal ions is kept constant Increase of the bion1ass concentration of the biosorption system could result in increasing the sorption site interactions. When the biomass concentration is low, metal ions in the solution would not only be adsorbed to the surface of the biomass, but also enter into intracellular part through facilitating the concentration gradient of metal ion. For example, for the adsorption of zinc by T. grandis L.j:, the data shows that the metal uptake increases and the percentage adsorption of zinc decreases with increases in metal ion concentration. This increase (4.38-12.97 tng/g) is a result of increases in ·the driving forces, i.e., the concentration gradient. However, the percentage adsorption of zinc ions onto T. grandis
L.f decreased from 73.11% to 43.23%. Though an increase in metal uptake was

observed, the decrease in percentage adsorption may be attributed to the lack of sufficient surface area to accomtnodate the increase in metal available in the solution (Kutnar et al., 2006). Dundar et al. (2008) studied the biosorption of Cu 2+ ions onto the litter of a natural trembling poplar forest. Adsorbate concentrations were varied fron1 30 to 200 tng/L. They found that the equilibriutn concentration of Cu 2+ increased with increasing adsorbate concentration, because of decreasing surface area per unit adsorbent as well as the fact that the removal efficiency was decreased from 100 to 47.2% when the initial concentration was increased from 30 to 200 mg/L.

3. 5 Biosorption equilibrium
In the presence of a solid phase (sorbent) and liquid phase (solvent, normally water) that contains m_etal ions, biosorption proceeds due to the higher "affinity" of the sorbate that is attracted into the solid and bound there by different mechanisms. The process continues until equilibrium is established between the amount of solid-bound sorbate species and its portion remaining in solution. The degree of the sorbate' s "affinity" for the sorbent detern1ines its distribution between the solid and liquid phases. The quality of the sorbent tnaterial is judged according to how much sorbate it can attract and retain in an "imtnobilized" form. For this purpose it is customary to determine the metal uptake by 27

Literature Review

the biosorbent as the amount of sorbate bound by a unit of solid phase (by weight or volume).

The characteristics of the biosorption behavior are generally analyzed by means of equilibrium isotherms and biosorption kinetics. The biosorption isotherms are also an important tool used to understand the biosorption mechanism for theoretical evaluation. Many models have been developed to relate the adsorbate concentration in the bulk and the adsorbed amount on the adsorbent. A description of the most commonly used models in adsorption follows.

3. 5~1 Langmuir isotherm Model
Langmuir is the tnost commonly used n1odel for n1onolayer adsorption. The basic assumptions in the model development are that there are a fixed nmnber of adsorption sites, each site can hold only one adsorbate molecule (the adsorbed layer is one molecule in thickness), all sites are equivalent, and there is no interaction between adsorbed tnolecules (Langmuir, 1918). Moreover, biosorption takes place at specific hon1ogeneous sites within the biosorbent. The Langmuir equation can be used to describe equilibrium for sorption of different sorbate-sorbent systems (Volesky and Naja, 2003). The Langtnuir equation is expressed as:

qe = .qmax. ·b·Ce (l+b·Ce)

This n1odel is mostly used for heterogeneous surfaces with a multi-site adsorption isotherm. The basic assumptions for the model development are that there is an infinite supply of unreacted sorption sites, and that the adsorption sites are distributed exponentially with respect to the heat of adsorption.

Ten1kin and Pyzhev, ( 1940) considered the effects of indirect adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on adsorption isothern1s. The heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer would decrease linearly with coverage due to adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. The Ten1kin isotherm has been used in the following form:

3. 7 Biosorption process in a continuous system
Removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions by biosorption plays an important role in water pollution control. Different types of sorption columns are used depending upon their advantages and disadvantages. The sorption columns are classified as:
~

Fixed-bed biosorption colutnn

>

Completely mixed sorption systen1

Following is a brief description of these sorption systems and their advantages and disadvantages (Volesky and Naja, 2003).

3. 7$1 Fixed-bed biosorption
In a fixed-bed biosorption column biosorbent granules are tightly packed, allowing the

metal-bearing stream to freely pass through the column. Dissolved metals are gradually
removed from the liquid phase as they meet fresher and fresher sorbent as they trickle down the bed. Effluent leaving the column contains extremely low residual amounts of n1etals in the range of 10-50 ppb, which are often undetectable. As the biosorbent in the column eventually starts to become fully loaded and the effluent n1etal concentration at the exit starts gradually increasing, the column is shut down and the flow is diverted into a standby fresh column. Figure 3.4 illustrates a typical dual-colutnn continuous-flow operating sorption system.

Biosorbent granules are fluidized in the column bed by upward flowing liquid. The main advantage of this arrangement is that the feed stream does not need to be completely 33

Literature Review

particle free. The major disadvantage of the fluidized bed system is that it cannot utilize the biosorbent charge to its maximum potential because its contents are constantly being mixed. In this way the sorption driving force of the metal concentration gradient between the solid and liquid phases is always lower, and it is more difficult to achieve a well polished effluent. Portions of used-up, saturated biosorbent can be removed from the bottom of the column while fresh biosorbent is added at the top. Clear, treated effluent flows out the top where it is in contact with the relatively freshest biosorbent. The fluidized bed is more expanded, taking up 30-40% more volume. The fluid bed contactor typically consists of a 3m-high, cylindrical column filled to slightly more than halfway with biosorbent, which then expands · upon fluidization. Even very high flow rates (200,000 Ud) can be conveniently handled by such systems, which can be modularly combined in parallel (Volesky and Naja, 2003). A sketch of a fluidized bed column sorption system is shown in Figure 3.5.

3.7. 3 Completely mixed sorption system
In this type of a contact systetn the concentration gradient, important for effective sorption, is greatly n1inimized. In a one-stage system the concentration of the sorbent throughout the mixed contactor is the san1e as in its effluent. This type of a sorption system may be useful in the following cases:

?

Several systems with intermittent solid concentration steps can be effectively operated in a counter-current series process arrangement.

The mixing in the sorption contactors is either mechanical or pneumatic. The sorption suspension must be relatively dilute to allow mixing. Conespondingly, the volutnes of the contactor vessels are large. Mixed bed contactors are often utilized in series in order to handle large volumes of inflow and to assure effluent standards. The number of stages and the residence tin1e of the solution in each contactor are determined for the desired optitnal performance of the system (Volesky, 2003). Figure 3.6 shows a counter-current sorption operation.

3.8 Breakthrough curve and mass transfer zone in a fixed bed column
Figure 3. 7 shows a typical breakthrough curve for a contaminant as the ratio of the effluent concentration (Ce) to the initial concentration (C 0 ) versus time or throughput volume in a fixed-bed column. When the breakthrough curve is sharp, the most efficient adsorption performance will be obtained. It is clear from Figurer 3. 7 that for a short initial period the contaminant in the feed is taken up completely by the column. Then, the effluent concentration increases with time and the breakthrough curve develops. At the breakthrough time (tb), the contaminant concentration at the bed exit reaches a specified concentration (Cb), while the loading of the columns continues until the saturation point (ts) is reached, at which the effluent concentration becomes equal to the feed concentration. The general position of the breakthrough curve along the time or effluent volume axis depends on the capacity of the column with respect to the amount of contaminant applied to the column.

Literature Review

contaminated water is passed through the bed of adsorbent, a mass transfer zone is formed where continuous adsorption of the solute into the adsorbent in the bed occurs. The solute is rapidly adsorbed on the first layer of the bed until the amount adsorbed is in equilibrium with influent contaminant concentration. At this time, the adsorbent is loaded to its capacity, and that portion of the bed is exhausted. This zone is called the equilibrium zone. The depth of the mass transfer zone is controlled by many factors, depending on the contaminant being adsorbed the characteristics of the

and

hydraulic factors. The depth of the mass transfer zone is a measure of physical/chen1ical resistance to mass transfer. Once formed, the mass transfer zone moves up through the adsorbent bed until it reaches the top, whereupon the effluent concentration of the contaminant in the aqueous phase begins to rise (Chu, 2004).

The length of the tnass transfer zone is also called the critical bed depth, which is the theoretical depth of the adsorbent that is sufficient to prevent the eft1uent solute concentration from exceeding the desired breakthrough concentration at zero time. The length of time or volume of water treated until the breakthrough point is decreased by increased particle size, increased solute concentration in the int1uent, increased pH value of the water in the case of adsorption of weak electrolytes, increased flow rate, and decreased bed depth (Faust and Aly, 1987).

3 . 9 Adsorption column design parameters
To model the breakthrough behavior of a biosorption column with a high degree of accuracy, the use of sin1pler and more tractable models that avoid the need for numerical solution appears more suitable and logical and could have immediate practical benefits. Several such models have been applied to biosorption columns. The well-known Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) analysis, derived from the Bohart-Adams model, has been used by a number of researchers to model the breakthrough behavior of biosorption columns (Kumar and Bandyopadhyay 2006).

3&9 . 1 Empty bed contact time (EBCT)
One of the n1ajor design parameters to be evaluated is the contact time, or the empty bed contact time (EBCT) (Faust and Aly, 1987). Exhaustion curves are developed from the column data by plotting the effluent concentration versus the volutne processed or the processing time for each column. A horizontal line that intersects the breakthrough curves at the desired concentration is drawn to determine the breakthrough volume for each column. The flow rate in the column affects the breakthrough volume and the shape of the breakthrough curve. The EBCT can be determined from the following equation (Netpradit et al., 2004):

The BDST method is based on a model proposed by Adan1s (1920), Among the various design approaches, the Adan1s-Borhart equation is widely used. The BDST is a simple model for predicting the relationship between the bed depth (Z) and the service time (t). The BDST model is based on the assumption that the rate of adsorption is controlled by the surface reaction between adsorbate and the unused capacity of the adsorbent (Ran1alho, 1983).

The Adams-Borhart equation can be presented as follows (Kumar and Bandyopadhyay,
2006):

Equation 3.14 enables the determination of the service time (t) of an adsorption bed with
a specified bed depth (Z) of adsorbent. The service time and bed depth are correlated with

the process parameters such as the initial pollutant concentration, the solution flow rate, and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent. From Equation 3.14, a straight line on the BDST model is expressed as:

Chapter 3

Literature Review

the adsorption rate is proportional to both the residual capacity of the activated carbon and the concentration of the sorbing species. The Adams-Bohart model is used to describe the initial part of the breakthrough curve (Hamdaoui, 2006; Han et al., 2008).

The kinetic equation developed from the Thomas model is widely used, and it is based on the Thomas' derivation ( 1948). The kinetic equation tnay also be derived from the Bohart-Adams model (Reynolds, 1982). The principal experimental data required is a breakthrough curve from a test column. The Thon1as, or reaction, tnodel, which assumes Langmuir kinetics of adsorption-desorption and no axial dispersion, is derived with the assumption that the rate driving force obeys second-order reversible reaction kinetics (Kazem et al., 2007). The expression by Thomas for an adsorption column is as follows (Reynolds 1982):

The Yoon-Nelson model is a relatively simple model that addresses the adsorption and breakthrough curves of adsorbate vapors, or gases, using activated charcoal (Yoon and Nelson, 1984).

The importance of biosorption processes due to their potential ability to remove heavy n1etals from dilute solutions on a large scale, where other treatment processes are not feasible, and the urgent need for procedural developtnents from the industrial point of view were the tnain reasons for the current study. In this study, wheat straw was chosen as the biosorbent for removal of the heavy metal ions cadmiutn (Cd2+) and copper (Cu 2+) from wastewater. The availability of wheat straw in huge quantities, especially in Canada, was the reason for the choice of wheat straw as a biosorbent.

To study the effectiveness of wheat straw as biomass in the biosorption process, the research was focused on the evaluation of the adsorption capacity of wheat straw in batch and continuous fixed-bed column systems. In addition, the experimental results were fitted to mathematical tnodels that predict the breakthrough curves of the n1etal uptake in the fixed-bed column.

A known amount of the bion1ass was washed 5 times with distilled water at roon1 temperature to remove the dust from the wheat straw and then pretreated using 0.1 N sulfuric acid (H 2S04 ) then 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Heavy metal solutions of desired concentration were prepared by dissolving analytical grade Cadn1ium Sulfate Octahydrate 3CdH2S04 ·8H20 and Cupric Sulfate Pentahydrate CuS04 ·5H20 in distilled water. Stock solutions of 1000 mg/L concentrations were prepared for both Cd2+ and Cu 2+. The pH of the wastewater was measured using a pH meter~ which was calibrated on a daily basis using buffer solutions of pH 4 and 7. At the beginning of any experimental run, the pH of the wastewater was adjusted using 0.1 N sodiun1 hydroxide (NaOH) or 0.1 N sulfuric acid (H 2S04).

In most cases, it is advantageous to use two or more smaller fixedbed colun1ns operated in series rather than one large column containing the same arnount of adsorbent (Faust and Aly, 1987). Fixed-bed columns in series are used when the utilization of the increased maxin1um adsorption capacity of the adsorbent will pay for the additional capacity and operating costs of two or more smaller columns in lieu of one large column. Moreover, for a fixed-bed column, it is desirable to have a high height to diameter ratio, 'ZJD, because the percent utilization of the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increases with this ratio. Usually, Z/D from 3:1 to 5:1 is recommended (Faust,

1987). This recommendation was taken into account in the design of the columns used in the current study.

ExQeritnental Method

The holding tank had a capacity of 1000 liters. Solutions of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ with initial concentrations of 1OOmg/L were prepared in the tank. All the experiments for the continuous study were perforn1ed at room temperature (25 °C) with initial pH of 6.0 for Cd2+ and 5.5 for Cu 2+. The initial pH was decided based on the precipitation properties of Cd2+ and Cu 2+. The effect of the length of the pack bed was studied using the above mentioned parameters with one, two, three or all column sections available. The equivalent column heights were 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 meters. Flow rates of 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 L/min were used for both the Cd2+ and Cu 2+ solutions.

Dry wheat straw was cut to one-inch lengths and packed into the columns with synthetic fiber tneshes placed at both the top and the botton1 to hold the wheat straw packing. To distribute the flow of contaminated water, a liquid distributor was placed on the fiber tnesh of each column. In order to prepare packing of the same porosity each time, the colutnn was packed at various heights using a density of wheat straw packing of 68.54 g/L that was based on the packing density in a 0.5 m high colutnn. The four columns were connected in series, and the liquid was putnped into the bottom of each column.

During each run, san1ples were taken from the sample points at 5-minute intervals at the start of experiment and then at 30-minute intervals until the experiment was completed. The experimental time for each n1n was approximately eight hours in order to assure the formation of a breakthrough curve. The nun1ber of samples collected from each column for each run was 20. The residual metal concentration in the water san1ples was measured using an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer.

In order to calculate the total quantity of metal adsorbed in the column Mads (mg), we considered the area above the breakthrough curve obtained frotn the plot of outlet metal concentrations (n1g/L) versus time (min) multiplied by the flow rate (LPM). The uptake capacity was calculated by dividing the n1etal adsorbed (Mads) by the total weight of the biotnass in the column (g)" The total amount of metal ions that entered the column can be calculated from the following equation:

The experimental sensitivity was conducted by considering the important instrun1ents used for experimental data readings. In this regard the sensitivity analysis was performed as:

Error from instruments

The insttuments involved in the experimental study that are t1ow meter balances, pH meter, shaker water bath system and atomic adsorption spectrophotometer

·

Error from manual readings

The errors can come from different areas that are weight of the wheat straw, sampling the treat water, and preparation of the solutions. In order to compare the discrepancy of the experimental results generated from the above mentioned possible error generation the experiments were perforn1ed three times. The average deviation fron1 the n1eans of all experiments was within

Figure 4.3 shows a picture of the SEM and EDS used

properties such as electrical conductivity. This particular type of microscope is exceeding! y useful.

The SEMis designed for direct study of the surfaces of solid objects. By scanning them with an electron beam that has been generated and focused by the operation of the microscope, an image is formed in tnuch the same way as on a TV. The SEM allows a greater depth of focus than an optical microscope does. For this reason the SEM can produce an image that is a good three-dimensional representation of the san1ple. Electron microscopes are scientific instruments that use a beam of highly energetic electrons to examine objects on a very fine scale. This examination can yield the following infonnation:

relationships between these features and the material's properties (hardness, reflectivity, etc.)

Morphology The shape and size of the particles making up the object, and the direct relationships between these structures and the n1aterial's properties (ductility, strength, reactivity, etc.)

Composition The elements and compounds that the object is composed of and their relative amounts, and the direct relationships between composition and the material's properties (melting point, reactivity, hardness, etc.)

Result nd Discussions

This chapter presents the findings achieved fron1 the experimental study using a batch systen1 and continuous packed column. Using the batch system, the effect of temperature, initial concentrations, pH, contact time, and co-adsorption on the adsorption of individual metal was studied. In addition the data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin Isotherms models along with thermodynamic study.

For continuous packed bed, the experimental results were analyzed to reveal the effect of the bed height and flow rates on the breakthrough curve. Moreover, different models were fitted to the experimental data.

5. 1 Batch system

5. 1. 1 Effect of initial Cd2+and Cu2+concentration
The effect of initial concentration of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on the adsorption efficiency by wheat straw was systetnaticaHy investigated by varying the initial concentration between 20 and 150 mg/L. Table 5 .1.1 represents the extent of uptake as well as the % uptake of Cd2+ and Cu2+ at various initial concentrations with a constant dose of adsorbent of 5 g/L, at 25°C and with the initial pH values of 5.5 and 6.0 for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively.

It \Vas observed that the percentage of metals ions retnoval reduced from 100 % to 53.5% and from 86% to 38% for Cd2+ and Cu 2+, respectively by increasing initial concentration fron1 20 to 150 mg/L. The reason is availability of the same surface site of biomass for the increasing initial concentrations that resulted in the saturation of the sorption sites on the biomass. The same trend of initial concentration dependency was 57

5.1.2 Effect of contact time
To analyze the saturation of the biomass that is stated as equilibrium point where no more room is available for metal sorption, the uptake amount of Cd2+ and Cu2+ was plotted against time as shown in Figures (5.1.1 and 5.1.2). When there was no more increase in the uptake for a particular initial concentration, that time was taken as the maximum saturation time or equilibrium time of the particular case. It was observed that for all initial metal concentrations used there was a rapid increasing trend of the metal uptake during first 30 minutes of the experiment with an average of 80 -90 % of the overall uptake for both Cd2+ and Cu 2+. However, the equilibrium time varied between 60-210 minutes for Cd2+ with increasing initial concentration and, 75-210 minutes for Cu 2+. So it was concluded that the equilibrium or saturation point occurred at about 210 minutes of the experiment.

5.1.3 Effect of temperature
Effect of temperature on biosorption of metal ions by wheat straw was studied at varied temperatures of 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C, the initial concentration of 100 mg/L and the pH of 5.5 and 6.0 for Cd2+ and Cu2+, respectively. Figure 5.1.3 shows the effect of increased temperature on the metal uptake for both Cd2+ and Cu 2+. It was observed that there is a slight increase in metal uptake with increased temperature.

Figure 5.1.3 shows that the maximum of biosorption of metal ions increase with an increased temperature for both Cd2+ and Cu2+. The increase in biosorption with temperature may be attributed to increase in the surface of the active sites available for biosorption on the adsorbent and thus enhancing biomass uptake ability.

5$1 . 4 Effect of initial pH
Biosorption of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions depends on pH properties of the adsorbent, the concentration of the adsorbate and the presence of ions in solutions. It has been consistently shown that pH is the dominant parameter controlling the adsorption process. Specifically, cation adsorption increases with the solution pH (Deng and Ting, 2005).

Biosorption is a process of interaction between the biosorbent and metal ions. The biosorption capacity is a function of the degree of interaction that in turn depends on the properties of both the adsorbent and adsorbate materials. This interaction is dependent on the surface charge on the adsorbent and the metallic specie. pH controls the ionization of the functional groups on the biomass surface, contributing to the surface charge. The electrostatic attraction should occur when the biosorbent materials provide negative or a partially negative surface charge for cationic metallic species. The uptake of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ as a function of the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution was examined over a pH range of 3-7 for Cd2+ and 3-6.5 for Cu 2+. Figure 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 depict the effect of pH on the adsorption of metal ions on wheat straw. The adsorption of both metal ions increased ·with pH. Cd2+ uptake, having a maximum value of 14.4 n1g/g at pH 7, showed a progressive decrease to 2.78 at a pH of 3. Sin1ilarly for Cu 2+ uptake were 3.38 mg/g at pH 3 and 12.38 tng/g at pH 6.5. Table A-1 shows max. uptake for Cd2+ and Cu 2+ for various values of pH with initial concentration of 100 mg/L at 25 °C in Appendix A. The main reason for this pH behavior could be that the affinity of the proton (H+) to the binding sites of wheat straw was much greater than that of the heavy metals ions (Vianna et. al,2000). As a result, almost no biosorption of the metal ions at pH below 2.2. The increase of solution pH resulted in the electrical repulsion force being weaker and the metal ions could be adsorbed on the biomass surface.

5.1.5 Effect of co-adsorption on the adsorption of individual metal
The feasibility and efficiency of biosorption process depends not only on the properties of the biosorbents, but also on the composition of the wastewater. Usually the industrial effluents contain more than one heavy metal ion. The biosorption process involves competition of heavy metal ions for a limited number of binding sites on wheat straw. It is very important to study the effect of co-adsorption to see the biosorption capacity for all metal ions present in the wastewater. Table 5.1.3 presents the comparison between the maximum biosorption of Cd2+ and Cu2+on wheat straw for single and binary systems. The binary system was prepared for Cd2+ and Cu2+. It was presented 50% for each ion and mixed together. From the results were observed that wheat straw attracts more Cu2+ ions as compared with Cd2+in a binary system.

5.1.6 Isotherm models for biosorption of Cd2+ and Co2+ on wheat straw
Tbere are many equilibrium adsorption isotherm models available. These models are usually used to determine the capacity of an adsorbent when the solution reaches equilibrium. In this study three classic isotherm models were used to fit the equilibrium data of Cd2+ and Cu2+ adsorbed on wheat straw. These models are Langmuir, Freundlich and the Temkin isotherms. . 63

5.1.7 Langmuir isotherm model
The experimental data for single ion solutions were fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model for both Cd2+ and Cu2+. Figure 5.1.6 shows the Langmuir biosorption isotherm of Cd2+ and Cu2+ by wheat straw.

The values of the biosorption capacity, qmax, and the Langmuir constant, b, were obtained from linear regression and presented in Table 5.1.5. The maximum uptake were 15.75 and 12.75 mg/g for Cd2+ and Cu 2+respectively. The value of the coefficient of determination, r2 , for Cd2+ is 0.994, indicating a good fit of the mono-layer Langmuir model to the biosorption of Cd2+ on the wheat straw. However, the model fitting for Cu 2+ as reflected by the r2 value of 0.978.

The r2 values for Cd2+ and Cu 2+ were found to be 0.0.98 and 0.99, respectively. Table 5.1.5 compares the results from the Langmuir and Freundlich model.

The adsorbate-adsorbate interactions were not considered in the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Temkin and Pyzhev considered the effects of adsorbate/adsorbate interactions on adsorption isotherms. The heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer would decrease linearly with coverage due to adsorbate/adsorbate interactions (Tan et al., 2007).

A plot of qe versus (ln Ce) yielded a linear line. The results are presented in Figure 5.1.8 for both Cd2+ and Cu2+. From the linear regression the r2 values of 0.96 for Cd2+ and 0.89 for Cu 2+ indicates that the biosorption of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on wheat straw does not conform to the model well. Of all the isotherm models used in data fitting, the Langmuir model provides the best fit to the data.

5el . 10Thermodynamic parameters
To study the thermodynamics of biosorption, the biosorption experiments were carried out at 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C. It was found that the biosorption capacity increased with temperature. One of the reasons for this behavior could be explained as at high temperature the cellulose fibers expanding up more and thus enhancing the biosorption process. The equilibrium constant, Ka, was evaluated at each tetnperature using Equation 3.9. Table 5.1.6 shows the Ka values for the biosorption of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ on wheat straw at 25°C for various initial concentrations. It was found from the results that the values of

Ka increased with decreasing initial concentration of each ion.

The free energy changes for the metal adsorption to biomass can be determined by using the equilibrium constants obtained from Langmuir isotherm model. The standard Gibbs free energy /1Go was evaluated by Equation 3.6. The results in Table 5.1.7 shows that the values of free energy changes, /1Gc of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ were negative, confirming that the biosorption of Cd2+ and Cu2+ onto wheat straw is spontaneous and

thermodynan1ically favorable see the results of the thermodynatnic study in Appendix B . The more negative values of 11G imply a greater driving force to the adsorption process. According to Equation 3.7, the plot of (T) versus ( l:iG'') should give a linear relationship from which ~S and iJ.H0 can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot

Figures 5.2.1-5.2.4 show the breakthrough curves with various bed depths at a varied flow rates of 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 LPM, for Cd2+ respectively. The EBCT is determined from Equation 3.10, and the time of breakthrough curve tb at which the outlet concentration that equal to Cb =10% of the inlet concentration). Table 5.2.1 shows that the Contact time (EBCT), volun1e treated (Vb), and the breakthrough time (tb) increase vvith increasing bed depth (Z) while the shape and gradient of the breakthrough curves are significantly different for the variable bed depths in Figures 5.2.1-5.2.4 .. The slope of the breakthrough curves of the longer bed (2.0 n1) tended to be more gradual. This effect was higher at higher tlow rate of 1.0 LPM. As expected, an increased bed height resulted in high volume of metal solution treated and high percentage of Cd2+ ren1oval while the uptake capacity of cadmium Cd2+ per unit 1nass of wheat straw remained almost identical for different bed heights investigated, probably because the adsorbed amount was strongly dependent on the amount of sorbent available for sorption (Vijayaraghavan et al., 2004). As can be seen fron1 all breakthrough curves the slope of S-shape from tb tots decreased as the bed height increased from 0.5-2.0 m. For Cu2+ a similar trend was observed as can be seen in Figures (C-1 )-(C-4) and Table C-1 in Appendix C.

5.2.2 Effect of flow rate
In order to investigate the effect of liq~id flow rate on biosorption of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ by

wheat straw, experiments were performed with four different flow rates of 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 LPM. The flow rate effect was studied along with the effect of the column height at an initial concentration of 100 mg/L. Figure 5.2.5 represents the results obtained from a case study with Cd2+. While the results for Cu2+ are shown in Figure C-5 and Table C-1
i~ Appendix C. In Figure 5.2.5 the concentration uptake of Cd2+ is plotted against time

for different flow rates with a column height of 2.0 meter.

It is observed that the percentage uptake of heavy metal strongly depends upon the flow

rate of the input stream. As from Figure 5.2.5, it is obvious that when the flow rate is 73

increased from 0.3 to 1.0 LPM, the break through curve is shifted toward a lower time scale. That represents a shorter active life of the column. For example, from Table 5.2.1, when the flow rate is increased by 66% (from 0.3 to 0.5 LPM) the percentage of metal removal of the adsorption column could reduced by 16.4%. Similarly by increasing the flow rate further by 60 % (from 0.5 to 0.8 LPM) the percentage of metal removal further reduce by 15.5 %. Further increase in the flow rate by 25 % (from 0.8-1.0 LPM) can further reduce the percentage of the metal removal by 11.4%.

The above mentioned behavior was observed for all column heights with a slight difference in the percentage of the metal removal of the column. This sensitive behavior of column adsorption to flow rate can be explained by the biosorption process is critical to residence time (Netpradit et al., 2004), and as the flow rate is increased the residence time of the solution in the column decreases and the percentage of the metal removal is decreased. In order to obviate the relationship between the optimum residence time and flow rate depending upon the percent removal and time the basis may be set for design purposes.

5 . 3 Modeling and analysis of column data
A number of mathematical models have been developed to describe the column breakthrough curves obtained at different bed depths, flow rates and inlet concentrations. In order to describe the fixed-bed column behavior and scale it up for industrial applications, four models, namely BDST, Thomas, Adams-Bohart, and Yan model were used to fit the experimental data of the column and to evaluate the perfonnance.

5. 3. 1 Bed depth service time model (BDST)
Data collected during laboratory and pilot plant tests serve as the basic for the design of a full-scale adsorption column. Figure 5.2.6 shows the plot of the service time versus the bed height at different flow rates with an initial concentration of 100 mg/L at 10% breakthrough point (i.e. Cout=lO mg/L) for Cd2+ ions. The equations of linear relationship were obtained with r2 above 0.99 indicating the validity of the BDST model in representing the adsorption in a fixed bed in the present study. As indicated by Equation 3.14 for the BDST 1nodel, the sorption capacity of the bed per unit volume (N0 ) can be calculated from slope of the line in Figure 5.2.6. The rate constant (K) of the BDST 1nodel calculated from the intercept of the plot, characterizes the rate of solute transfer from the liquid phase to the solid phase. The minimum bed depth (Zmin) was also calculated using Equation 3.15. The results presented in Table 5.2.2 show that the adsorption capacity (N 0 ) of Cd2+ was slightly reduced with increasing the flow rate; this indicates that the adsorption capacity n1ay increase with decreasing flow rate or increasing contact time (EBCT). The minimum bed depth (Zmin) was higher when the flow rate was increased because the adsorption zone must be increased for the retnoval of the heavy metal ions. Silnilar observation was reported by Netpradit et. al. (2004) in their study using metal hydroxide sludge for reactive dye adsorption in a fixed-bed column. The advantage of the BDST model is that any experimental test can be reliably scaled up to get the parameters without further experimental data and analysis. Although the model used values of intercept and slope at a given flow rate, in order to obtain higher accuracy more data should be obtained to check any deviation in the slope of straight line (Han et 75

Thomas model is one of the most widely used models to describe column biosorption data. From a plot of In [(CJC)-1] versus throughput volume (V) as shown in Figuer 5.2.9 the slope and intercept were calculated for bed depth 0.5-2.0 mat flow rate 0.3-1.0 LPM. The Thomas rate constant (KTH) and the maximum solid phase concentration (qt mg/g) were calculated from the values of the slope and the intercept, respectively, which are presented Figure 5.2.9. Thomas Model for Cd2+ at 0.3 LPM as well as in Figures C-8 and C-9 in Appendix C. and the data are listed in Table 5.2.3. Table 5.2.3 shows that Thomas model rate constant (KTH) increases with increased flow rate. Also by increasing bed volumes the value of (qt) slightly decreased. Similarly the data are listed in Table C-3 and Figures C-1 0, C-11 and C-12 for Cu2+ in Appendix C. Table 5.2. 3 Data of variables of Thomas model for biosorption of Cd2+ on wheat straw

The Adams-Bohart adsorption model was applied to experimental data for the description of the initial part of the breakthrough curve. This approach was focused on the estimation of characteristic parameters, such as maximum adsorption capacity (N0 ) and kinetic constant (KAB) from Adams-Bohart model. Equation 3.16 usually used to obtain the parameters for the relative concentration region (C/C 0 ) up to 0.5 or, in other words, up to 50% breakthrough point, by plotting the linearized form of Equation 3.16 i.e. ln(C/C 0 ) versus time. The results of Cd2+ are presented in Figures C-13 , C-14 and C15 Table 5.2.4 as well as the results of Cu 2+ are presented in Figures C-16, C-18 and Table C-6 in Appendix C .

5.3.4 Yan Model
From the Yan model Equation 3.22 a plot of In [C/(C0 -C)] versus In (V) was constructed, and the slope and the intercept were calculated for different bed depths and flow rates for Cd2+. The results are presented in Figures C-19 to C-24 in Appendix C. Table 5.2.5 shows the parameters of the Yan model. It was observed that Ky for this model increased with increasing the flow rate and decreased with increasing the bed depth.

From the above analysis it was found that the Tomas model was the most fit model with experimental Cd2+ and Cu 2+ uptake, based on r2 values, the reason of is Thomas model has .most of the parameter in the equation model that may exhibit true behavior of adsorption process and also we found that the uptake of metal ions in the Thomas model is good agreement with the experiment result than Yan model.

The model developed by Yoon and Nelson was applied to investigate the breakthrough behavior of cadmium and copper onto wheat straw. The values of the rate constant (KvN) and the time required for 50% sorbate breakthrough ( "& ) were determined from Equation 3.19. ln[C/(C0 -C)] versus time plots at different flow rates from 0.3-1.0 LPM and at different bed depths varied between 0.5-2.0 m with initial concentration 100 mg/L of Cd2+ are shown in Figures C-25 to C-27 in Appendix C. The results are listed in Table 5.2.6. From Table 5.2.6, it can be concluded that with increased rate of (KvN), 50% of the breakthrough time ( "& ) decreased with increasing the flow rate. The data in Table 5.2.6 also indicated that "&values are in a good agreement with experimental results. From the results obtained the model proposed by Yoon and Nelson provided a good correlation of the effect of bed height and flow rate.

5. 4 Wheat straw surface structure
The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) were used in ·this study to investigate the effect of the pretreatment on the structure surface of wheat straw as well as to study the structure changes into wheat straw due to biosorption process.

l\ certain amount of wheat straw samples were taken from the stock before and after

pretreatment of the wheat straw, as well as the wheat straw after adsorption equilibriutn of Cd2+ and Cu2+, the wheat straw was separated from the solution and the attached surface water was removed and then vacuum-dried for the electron microscopy preparation.

Wheat straw is a typical agricultural by-product that is annually produced and consumed. The chetnical analysis of wheat straw has been done by Sun et. al., ( 1998), it contains 3440% of cellulose, 30-35.5% hemicelluloses and 14-15% of lignin.

SENI itnages of the cross section area of wheat straw are shown in Figure 5.4. L In general, a wheat straw stetn consists of internodes, nodes and leaves. The nodes are hard locations where leaves are attached to the stem. The internodes are fonned as concentric ring, leaving a void or cavity in the center, as shown in Figure 5.4.1-a. The outer layer of wheat straw which is known as epidermis, it is rich in cellulose and has coating of silica on the surface. Parenchyma is a soft plant tissue n1ade up of thin walled cells that form the greater part of leaves, sten1 pith, roots and fruit pulp. Figure 5.4.1-b shows the vascular bundles, which is the fluid carrying vessels e.g., sap-carrying vessels in plants. Liu et al. (2003) indicated in their studies that the cellulose is the framework of the vascular bundles as well as the out layer is the primary wall and the annular and spiral structure is the lignified thickening secondary waH, which mainly contains of cellulose and surrounded by the primary wall.

Chapter 5

Result and Discussions

Figure 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 shows the cotnparison between natural and pretreated outer surfaces and the inner stn1cture of the wheat straw, respectively. It is evident from the following comparison that pretreatment can play a vital role in biosorption process. As for natural outer surface SEM analysis indicates that before pretreatment the fibers are not expanded and the surface area for the biosorption process is less compared with one that was pretreated. The wideness of the fiber threads is more for pretreated wheat straw thus enhancing biosorption process with giving more area of contact for heavy metals to be sorbed. Pretreatment practice not only alters the outer surface but also impacts the inner structure of the wheat straw. Figure 5.4.4 a and b shows the difference between the wheat straw inner structure before and after the pretreatment, respectively. It was observed that with pretreatment the inner opening of two adjacent channels n1ay increase by two times as shown by circled area in Figure 5.4.4 a and b.

This behavior of wheat stra\.v structural change can be explained as swelling tendency of fibrous material within wheat straw towards the acids or base used. So the inner view tells that there could be marks of some scratches thus creating some threads inside the surface of the wheat straw creating a friction factor that may also enhance the biosorption process. Another analysis is that before pretreatment, wheat straw is covered with a wax that is natural and behaves like a barrier between the heavy metals and the surface of the biomass, but while treated with chemicals (H 2S04 and NaOH) and following a certain procedure for pretreatn1ent as n1entioned above in the thesis this wax is ren1oved and giving a clean contact between the surface of the wheat straw and the heavy metal.

Figures 5.4.5 and 5.4.6 shows the pictures obtained from EDS, that indicates the either the wheat straw had any amount of Cd2+ or Cu2+ already placed on the outer surface or inner surface of the bion1ass. It is clear from EDS results that before putting the biomass into biosorption · process there is no Cd2+ or Cu 2+ present either on the inner or outer surface. Fig 5.4.7 and 5.4.8 shows the EDS analysis of wheat straw with after adsorption of Cd2+. It is quiet obvious that the heavy metals were attracted on the outer surface of the wheat straw as well as the inner surface. Cu 2+ ions were present all over the surface area including eyes, fiber ditches as well as at the inner level. The same behavior was observed for Cu 2+as shown in Figure 5.4.9 and 5.4.10

Modeling and Simulation

In this chapter a mathematical tnodel was developed to simulate the concentration changes at the experimental time instances. The objective of simulation study was to predict the break through curve occurrence with respect to experimental results. Law of conservation of mass applied to a differential element placed inside the physical boundary of the model as shown in Figure (6.1 ). Following are the set of assumptions considered for the n1athe1natical n1odel development:

Assumptions:

1. One dimensional flow and diffusion in the axial direction, where radial t1ow or

diffusion is negligible. 2. The fluid bulk temperature and density as well as the fluid velocity are constant. 3. Mass diffusivity is independent of the concentration of solute. 4. Mass transfer takes place between the bulk fluid concentration (C) and the wheat straw surface (Ce). In this case, the concentration at the surface of the particle, Ce, is the equilibriun1 concentration between the liquid and wheat straw. This concentration
(Ce) can be calculated from the Langmuir isothenn model Equation (3.1).

5. No intraparticle diffusion is involved in mass transfer. 6. There are no chemical reactions as the biosorption of the heavy metals ions in wheat straw is purely a physical phenon1enon. 7. There is no waH effect on the biosorption process. Figure 6.1 is an illustration of the mathematical model formulation.

The equations of analysis for fixed bed colutnn system are developed with respect to a tnass balance on small volume element. The chosen scale is representative of a finite element of volume, where the observed behavior can be considered analogous to any large-scale geometry. The derivation will begin with a description of each term in the model in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the contributions to 1nass transfer in a packed bed. This includes the convection, diffusion, and bulk accumulation terms.

6 . 1 Convection
When a net flow occurs, the total rate of mass transfer of the individual species is increased or decreased due to the bulk flow or convection effect, which is a tnechanism of mass transfer (Seader, 1998). The convection term accounts for the species total velocity based on stationary co-ordinates, with observer fixed in space. It corresponds to the mass transfer flux involving the net movement of the liquid or bulk tlow. Hence, using the finite volume element, so the net flux of mass is expressed in Equation 6.2.

(6.2)

Where: C= concentration of species ions in the bulk solutions (Kg/m3). Jc= net flux of mass due to convection ( Kg/m2 · sec) v =superficial velocity (rnlsec) 99

Chapter 6

Modeling and Simulation

Since mass flux is equal to the tnass transfer per unit area, the net rate of mass transfer is described in Equation 6.3.

Nc == v A c
Where:

Iz -v A c Iz+dz

(6.3)

Nc= net rate of mass transfer due to convection (Kg/sec). A= cross section area of packed bed (m 2)

Ordinary molecular diffusion occurs if a concentration gradient exists; that is, a species (ions) diffuses in the direction of decreasing concentration. The diffusion occurs in different direction for the case when mass is consumed in the bulk phase, as opposed to when mass is generated. The diffusion tenn accounts for mass transfer at a molecular level, which can be expressed as a flux since it is proportional to the area normal to the direction of mass transfer. This phenomenon is described by Fick' s Law of molecular diffusion.

Ja =Flux due to diffusion (Kg!tn .sec)

According to the Figure 6.1, the accumulation of material within the control volume can be described by Equation 6. 7. Essentially this tenn exists due to the fact that the system is dynamic or
unsteady-state~

which implies that the concentration throughout the packed

bed will change as a function of thne.

6o4 Boundary conditions
Since the mathematical n1odel depicted in Equation 6.11 contains a second order derivative with respect to z, the location down the bed, two boundary conditions are required to solve this equation.

>-

First boundary condition

At the entrance of the packed bed colutnn, the concentration of the entering species can be considered constant. This assumes that there are no fluctuations in incoming feed concentration. Therefore, Equation 6.12 shows the first boundary condition.

C (0, t) = Cin
~

(6.12)

Second boundary condition

The second boundary conditions consist of an assumption that once the fluid has reached the end of the bed column, its concentration is fairy constant, or it has reached its steadystate value. Essentially, the concentration is not changing with respect to time at the bed exit.

de =O

dz
6$5 Initial conditions

(6.13)

Since the mathematical model depicted in Equation 6.11 contains a first order derivative with respect tot, time, only one initial condition is required to solve this equation.
~

Initial condition

Prior to the commencement of the experiment, the bed at time t=O should have initially clean interstitial spaces. Equation 6.14, illustrates the concept.

c (i, 0) =0
103

(6.14)

Chapter 6

Modeling and Simulation

This condition corresponds to an infinitely fast "jump" in concentration when the experiment begins, or immediately proceeding time t=O. This ideal assumption is convenient; however, it causes some computational difficulties.

6 . 6 Mathe1natical model solution
Above obtained model equation 6.11 representing the change in concentration with time and length of the column was highly non linear and its analytical solution was not possible. To integrate the equation, numerical rnethods were applied to approximate the integrated solution over the experimental time instances. For that purpose the PDE was converted to set of ODEs applying second order finite difference method. In order to apply finite difference method the physical model was divided into nodes along the vertical direction of the colun1n. ODE was written for all the corresponding nodes.

Three n1ain sections of the physical model were written for the set of ODEs. Following are the ODE written for the corresponding grid points:

lVIass transfer to (or from) packed beds occurs often in processing operation, including drying operations, adsorption or desorption of gases or liquid by solid particles such as charcoal, and n1ass transfer of gases and liquids to solid particles
(Geankoplis~

1993).

The n1ass transfer coefficient is correlated as a dimensionless J0 factor which is related to

Kc and Schmidt number (Nsh) as follows.

6. 8 Result and discussion
Above developed model was solved using the numerical techniques described above. The result for change in concentration was obtained at the exit of colutnn. The simulation study was conducted for four column heights for which experin1ental study was performed that are 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 meters.

Figures 6.2- 6.5 show comparison of experimental and simulated concentration profiles. It was observed that model could predict well changes in concentration at experimental time instances. Fron1 Figure 6.2-6.5 the error was calculated between experimental and calculated values that is 7.5 -15%, which is acceptable.

The simulation study was conducted to see the effect on concentration by changing the velocity. As in experhnental work, Figures 5.2.1-5.2.4 shows comparison for this particular case. Similarly, it was observed that model can simulate experimental conditions in this particular. As from experimental study, by increasing the velocity the occurrence of breakthrough curve is shifted. For example, in the case of 2 meter length when t1ow rate was increased from 0.3 to 1.0 LPM, the time domain for breakthrough curve occurrence decreased from 150 to 40 minutes. The same behavior was obtained by simulation study. This observation indicates that the developed model can well explain the behavior of concentration changes based on the assumptions and data supplied.

In order to find out the sensitivity of calculations, the calculations were perfonned by decreasing the step size. Because in this particular case no step size controller was employed, so it was important to integrate the equation for a certain limit not to ignore adrupt changes. For that purpose, the n1ost effective step size was 0.001 thne integration.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Conclusion
Biosorption of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ by wheat straw were studied. The study was conducted using batch and continuous fixed bed systen1s. For batch system experiments, the removal of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ was studied over a range of initial tnetal concentrations, temperatures, and pH values. It was concluded that increasing ten1perature and initial pH the biosorption process was enhanced. By increasing the temperature from 20 to 40 °C at an initial concentration 100 mg/L, the n1etal uptake increased from 12.2-15.7 mg/g and 9.1 to 12.2 tng/g for Cd2+ and Cu 2+, respectively. Sin1ilarly by increasing initial pH of concentration fron1 3 to 7, adsorption capacity of Cd2+ and Cu 2+ increased 2.7-14.4 mg/g and 3.38-12.38 mg/g, respectively.

The Langn1uir, Freundlich, and Temkin models were used to study biosorption isotherm. It was found that Langmuir isotherm n1odel best fit experimental results, which suggests the biosorption process for this system is monolayer and hon1ogenous.

The thermodynamic study of the biosorption process was conducted and it was found that the system was spontaneous for both Cd2+ and Cu 2+ based on the negative values of the Gibbs free energy change
C~G).

In continuous fixed bed column system with four columns in series, the effect of flow rate on the biosorption process was studied using a range of flow rates from 0.3 to 1.0 LPM. Breakthrough curves were obtained for different heights and different flow rates. It was found that breakthrough was strongly dependent upon the flow rate. The biosorption process showed very effective uptake percentage at low flow rates (0.3 LPM) and tall 111

Conclusion and Recomn1endations

columns (Z=2.0 m). The BDST n1odel was used to predict the relationship between the bed depth and the service time. The n1inimum bed height was estimated to be 0.4-1.55 m for flow rate 0.3-1.0 LPM, respectively.

Application of other mathematical models to fixed bed biosorption systems was also studied. The Thotnas, Adams-Bohart, Yan, and Yoon-Nelson models were used to fit the experimental data. The Thomas n1odel was showed to be the best fit with experimental results.

The biosorption of heavy metals was also confirmed by conducting microscopic study of the wheat straw inner and outer surface. Microscopic studied was performed to wheat straw before and after pretreatluent. It was found that pretreatment can enhance the biosorption process by changing the structure of wheat straw surface. EDS study showed that there was no Cd2+ and Cu 2+ ions on the wheat straw originally, and Cd 2+ and Cu 2+ ions appeared on the surface of wheat straw after the biosorption process.

A mathetnatical model was developed to simulate experimentally obtained changes in the metal concentration with time. The study was performed for continuous fixed bed column system with four column heights and with varying flow rate of the inlet stream. It was found that the model can predict the change in the metal concentration with time as well as the effect of the liquid flow rate. The predicted values were found to be in the range of 7.5-15% errors.

7e2 Recommendations
The following recommendations are n1ade for further studies:
1- As the mechanism of biosorption on wheat straw is complex phenomenon. The binding

mechanisms and the binding sites for positively charged complexes have to be elucidated. Moreover it would be useful to investigate the stn1cture of wheat straw using different methods to find out the chemical groups on stn1cture. 2- Explore the potential application of wheat straw to wastewater from the industrial 3- Evaluate the criteria for the optimum performance of column for biosorption: inlet metal concentrations, pH, ionic strength, flow rate sorbent size distribution, and
9

packing density. 4- Establish the applicability of the mass transfer colun1n model to describe the biosorption process, providing the basis for the column scale-up.

The metal adsorbed = 9622.3 (mg/L ) . min *0.3 L/n1in = 2886.69 mg The uptake of Cd2+ in the column= The metal adsorbed divided by the total amount of wheat straw in the column So uptake ofCd2+ = 2886.69 mg/170 g = 16.9 n1g/g
