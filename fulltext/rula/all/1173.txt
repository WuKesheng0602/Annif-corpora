ABSTRACT Development of a Laboratory Analytical Method Beneficial to the Policies of the Canada-Wide Standards for Dioxins and Furans Eric Paul Buan Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University 2009 An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was tested for its ability to screen for PCDD/F in soils and sediments at 50, 1000 and 10,000 pi co grams toxic equivalents per gram of 1 soil (pgTEQ g- ). The correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS was strong for samples between 11 and 27,000 pgTEQ g- 1 (n=48, r2=0.994, slope=0.94). These results relied on two concepts developed in this thesis. The first, a congener correction factor, corrects ELISA results for differences in how ELISA and GC-HRMS calculate the dioxin content of a sample. The congener correction factor increased the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS TEQ values calculated using World Health Organization (WHO) toxic equivalency factors (TEF) from 83% to 94%. The correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS TEQ values calculated using North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) TEF remained strong when the correction factor was applied, falling from 102% to 94%. The second concept, a sample algorithm allows ELISA to efficiently measure unknown PCDD/F concentrations between 30 and 10,500 pgTEQ g" 1· The algorithm successfully placed 24 of 28 samples into their correct concentration ranges in a maximum of two ELISA each. A cost analysis of using the algorithm predicted that ELISA can screen samples three times faster than GC-HRMS while at a 60% reduction in operating cost. The success of ELISA in conjunction with its time and cost savings indicate that it can replace GC-HRMS in situations where the high precision of GC-HRMS is not required.

DIOXINS AND FURANS: PROPERTIES, REDUCTION INITIATIVES AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
Overview

Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) are a group of persistent, bioaccumulative chemicals that are toxic to both humans and wildlife (Mandai, 2005; Pesatori et al., 2003; Pelclova et al., 2002; Environment Canada, 1990). They are largely man-made (Srogi, 2008; Mandai, 200.5) with many different industries contributing to their release into the environment (CCME, 2004). Toxic effects of exposure to dioxins and furans (referred to herein as dioxins) include wasting syndrome, changes to the immune and reproductive systems, endocrine disruption and chloracne (Schecter et al., 2006; Mandai, 2005; Birnbaum and Tuomisto, 2000). Many of these effects have been observed in fish, bird and mammal studies at body burdens that approach levels present in the background human population (Martinez et al., 2003; Birnbaum and Tuomisto, 2000). Due to the toxicity of

dioxins, their creation and emission into the environment are controlled and monitored with international and national initiatives. Internationally, the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants has targeted them for reduction or elimination (Stockholm Convention, 2008). In Canada, the major dioxin reduction initiative is the Canada Wide Standards (CWS) for Dioxins and Furans (CCME, 2001). Although this initiative has achieved some interim

successes, the CWS will have difficulty in reaching its goal of virtually eliminating all Canadian dioxin emissions. In order to reach this goal, increased testing of known and suspected dioxin emitting sources as well as validation of new pollution prevention technologies is recommended (CCME, 2004). An increase in source testing and technology validation will likely rely on gas

CHAPTER ONE chromatography-high resolution mass spectroscopy (GC-HRMS) as it has the necessary sensitivity and accuracy.

The problem with an increased use of GC-HRMS for dioxin analysis is that it is expensive and time-consuming. As such, there is interest in finding new technologies that can replace the use of GC-HRMS in instances where its high precision and accuracy are not necessarily required. One such instance is the routine testing of sites for potential dioxin soil contamination. The aim of this thesis is to show that an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed by Cape Technologies is capable of becoming a low cost and rapid screening tool for dioxin contaminated soil. This will be accomplished by introducing and developing two new concepts, a congener correction factor and a sample algorithm, and examining their effects on the efficiency of ELISA and its correlation to GC-HRMS. A discussion on the applicability of using ELISA as a screening tool at existing and future dioxin contaminated sites will follow. If the improved ELISA can relieve some of the burden placed on GC-HRMS, GC-HRMS can become more available to help improve the successes of Canadian dioxin initiatives and thus improve the protection of human health and the environment.

As this group of molecules can contain any amount of chlorination on their benzene rings, 7 5 PCDD and 135 PCDF congeners exist. Of these 210 congeners, 7 PCDD congeners and 10 PCDF congeners display "dioxin-like" toxicity, but to differing degrees (CCME, 2002). The most toxic of these congeners is 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). Concentrations of each toxic congener are reported in Toxicity Equivalents (TEQ) by converting the concentration of each congener to the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD that would have the equivalent level of toxicity. This is calculated by multiplying the Toxic Equivalency Factor

(TEF) of a specific congener with either its mass or concentration (CCME, 2002) to get values typically reported in pgTEQ g- 1 for solid samples or pgTEQ L- 1 for liquids. When dealing with mixtures of dioxin congeners, TEQ values for each congener are summed up to get the total TEQ. Typically, the TEQ of a mixture is reported in order to avoid having to report values for

3

CHAPTER ONE each individual congener concentration. This simplifies the reporting of dioxin concentrations and allows for a simpler comparison between different mixtures of dioxin congeners.

The toxicity of the dioxin congeners is thought to be triggered once the dioxin molecule binds to an intracellular protein known as the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (Cuthill et al., 1988). The dioxin molecule binds stereospecifically to a ligand molecule on the Ah receptor and activates it. Once it is bound, the receptor-ligand complex interacts with dioxin-response elements (DRE) that transcribe various genes whose products are thought to bring about the toxicity within the organism (Whitlock, 1990). Depending on the organism and the extent of exposure to dioxin, many toxicological effects can occur.

1.2.2. Toxicological effects of dioxins and furans
Toxicological studies using 2,3,7,8-TCDD have been performed on many small mammals. Kransler et al., 2007 reports that guinea pigs and rhesus monkeys seem to be the most susceptible to dioxin poisoning whereas hamsters are far less harmed from dioxin exposure. The LD 50 for male guinea pigs has been estimated to be as little as 0.6 ~gTEQ kg- 1 (Schwetz, et al., 1973) whereas the LD 50 for hamsters was estimated to be upwards of 5000 ~gTEQ kg- 1 (Henck et al., 1981 ). Despite the large difference in LD 50 values, symptoms of acute toxicity tend to include a loss in fat, shrinkage of the spleen, changes in blood cell count and the thickening of the gastrointestinal tract (US EPA, 2003 draft). Symptoms of chronic exposure tend to include

immunotoxic, reproductive and developmental effects. Dioxin exposure is also thought to cause cancers in small mammals but not directly. It does so by altering chemicals found in the
bo~y

making them more damaging to DNA or by affecting cell growth pathways that in tum can

Humans are also susceptible to the toxic effects of dioxins. However, it is difficult to determine the exact health effects on humans since incidents that expose humans to dioxins often expose them to other contaminants as well (Environment Canada, 1990). Incidents of dioxin exposure include the use of Agent Orange as a chemical defoliant in Vietnam, which contained 2,3,7,8TCDD as a by-product (Schecter et al., 2006; Dow, no date), a 1976 explosion in Seveso, Italy where dioxins were released from a 2,4,5-trichlorophenol plant (Bertazzi et al., 1997) and a 1968 incident where furan had contaminated Yusho rice oil in Fukuoka, Japan (Schecter et al., 1994).

Incidents of human exposure to dioxins are not just relegated to events in the past. In recent years, it was discovered that residents of Midland, Michigan were being exposed to dioxin contaminated soil as a result of industrial activities found upstream of the Tittabawassee River. These activities have contaminated soils that are 10 to 20 times the levels found in nearby

5

CHAPTER ONE unaffected areas (Hilscherova et al., 2003). An incident in 2008 involved the consumption of dioxin contaminated pig meat in Ireland. An estimated  125m of pig meat was destroyed after dioxin concentrations reaching 80 to 200 times safe levels were detected in routine sampling of pig feed being supplied to Irish farms (MacConnell and Healy, 2008).

Human exposure to dioxins can cause weakness, chloracne (a skin rash) and other types of lesions and cysts (Srogi, 2008; Pesatori et al., 2003; Environment Canada, 1990; WHO, 1989). Other effects specifically linked to furan exposure include neurological and psychological effects, birth defects, and foetal deaths (Environment Canada, 1990). The possibility of dioxin being a human carcinogen has been debated over the past 20 years and now the US Environmental Protection Agency has classified dioxins as "likely to be carcinogenic to humans" (The National Academies, 2006).

1.2.3. Releases and bioavailability of dioxins and furans
Dioxins can only cause the health effects discussed above if organisms are exposed to the toxin. Consequently, a link must be made that connects the emission of dioxin into the environment to a sink that makes dioxin bioavailable to organisms. Dioxins are predominantly emitted into the environment as a by-product of incomplete combustion and chlorination processes (Environment Canada, 1990). The National Pollution Release Inventory (NPRI) considers the smelting of aluminum and lead, the operation of electric arc furnaces, the combustion of fuel in the pulp and paper industry and the manufacturing of iron as some specific industries that produce dioxin as a by-product (NPRI, 2003). It also lists the combustion of non-hazardous solid waste, biomedical
I

waste and municipal waste as sources. While many of these anthropogenic activities emit dioxin

6

CHAPTER ONE into the atmosphere through air emissions, the main sinks for dioxins are soils and sediments (Environment Canada, 1990).

Dioxin enters the soil through aerial deposition where it can accumulate to levels that can affect the surrounding environment. Srogi, 2008 notes that the majority of emitted dioxin gets

adsorbed onto dusts and soot where it then gets deposited into soils. Aerial deposition rates into soils around a Turkish industrial area with dioxin levels similar to many sites around the world were estimated to be between 7.6 and 66.3 ngTEQ m- 2 yea( 1 (Bakoglu and Karademir, 2005). These values can be considered problematic since they are greater than the depositions of between 3.4 and 13 .6 pgTEQ m-2 day-1 which are the values that are suggested to keep the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of dioxins below the 1-4 pgTEQ ki 1 dai 1 level proposed by the WHO (De Fre et al. , 2000).

Since the majority of dioxin pollution in Canada enters the environment by way of air emissions (CCME, 2002), not only must soil deposition occur to expose organisms to heightened levels of dioxins but the dioxins must persist in the soil in order to accumulate to levels that may be considered harmful. A study performed by Fattore et al., 2003 concludes that existing soil

contamination from the Seveso incident of 26 years ago is not re-entering the atmosphere and is staying relatively stable in the soil. In Vietnam, levels of dioxin exceeding 1,000,000 ppt have been measured in soils three to four decades after Agent Orange was used (Schecter et al., 2006). A study by Hilscherova and Kannan, 2003 shows that dioxins from a contaminated water source can accumulate and persist in the surrounding soil. The accumulation and persistence of dioxins in soil can explain how some areas have elevated levels of soil contamination when there are no

7

CHAPTER ONE releases to soils nearby. For instance, soils around the pulp and paper industry in British

Columbia have reported dioxin concentrations of up to 255 ngTEQ kg-1 (Environment Canada, 2005) when natural background levels should be only 4 ngTEQ kg-' (CCME, 2002).

While the accumulation and persistence in soil are responsible for elevating the levels of dioxin in the environment, its soil bioavailability makes it especially harmful. One study estimates that roughly 25% of the dioxin contamination in soil found in Midland Michigan can be directly absorbed by humans through oral ingestion (Ruby et al., 2002). A 2005 study by Watanabe et al. links the bioconcentration of dioxins in crows around a waste dumping site specifically to their ingestion of soil rather than their exposure to other sources of dioxin in the area. A food chain transfer study for dioxin originating from the spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam has confirmed that bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of dioxin does occur, travelling from soils to pond sediments then into fish and ducks and finally into the local residents who consume these animals (Dwemychuk et al., 2002). Another bioaccumulation link between contaminated soils and humans was noted in residents residing near a contaminated dump site in India. Links were made between the accumulation of dioxin from cows that graze on dump wastes into mothers who ingest milk and meat from these cows; dioxin is then passed into their children through breastfeeding (Kunisue et al., 2004). These studies tend to confirm that while the majority of dioxin enters into the bottom of the food chain through the ingestion of contaminated soil by animals and small organisms, 98.8% of human exposure to dioxins occurs through ingestion of meats and dairy products (Travis and Hattemer-Frey, 1991).

CHAPTER ONE 1.3. International and Canadian Dioxin and Foran Initiatives

Since dioxin is known to be toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative, many dioxin initiatives have been developed on both the international and national level. On the international level, the

World Health Organization (WHO) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) both have dioxin programs in place that act as reference points for dioxin programs found in countries around the world. On a national level, many countries have regulations that attempt to monitor, control and prevent the release of dioxin into the environment. This section will examine the WHO and NATO programs as well as the Canada-Wide Standards for Dioxins and Furans which is the leading Canadian dioxin reduction plan.

1.3.1. NATO dioxin initiatives
NATO's major contribution to the regulation of dioxins on an international scale was the introduction of a TEF scheme that unified several previously existing schemes that had slight differences (Kutz et al., 1990). The international toxicity equivalency factors (I-TEF) combined the better studied toxicity data of 2,3, 7,8-TCDD with the very limited toxicity data on other 2,3,7,8-substituted dioxins and furans to develop individual I-TEF values. Specifically, longterm whole animal studies were used and when not available, short-term studies, subchronic effects data, acute toxicity studies, and in vivo and in vitro enzyme induction data were used (Kutz et al., 1990). The I-TEF values developed by NATO are given in the Table 2.

Interestingly, Kutz et al., 1990 states that the I-TEF scheme was meant only as an interim measure to be used until congener specific toxicities or toxicities of dioxin mixtures could be better characterized. The I-TEF values were to be periodically updated when the science behind dioxin toxicity improves. Despite these recommendations, the I-TEF values have never been updated and this scheme continues to be the method used by some agencies to report dioxin congener concentrations including the US EPA for calculating emission concentrations, the European Union Directive on Incineration and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment's

Guidance on Site Specific Risk Assessment for Use at Contaminated Sites in Ontario (A.J.
Chandler, 2006; OMOE, 1996). The Canada-Wide Standards for Dioxins and Furans also use the NATO scheme for at least its Waste Incineration guidelines (CCME, 2001).

The alternative to using the NATO I-TEF values is the use of TEF values developed by the WHO. Switching from NATO I-TEF to WHO TEF values has been shown to increase the TEQ of a sample by approximately 1Oo/o (Van Leeuwen, 2000; Sinclair Knight, 2001; US EPA, 2005b draft). This may be one reason why the WHO TEF values have not been adopted by initiatives

10

CHAPTER ONE aimed at reducing dioxin levels; doing so will immediately make a source seem like a greater dioxin emitter even though the actual quality of its emissions has not changed. Despite the lack of use of the WHO scheme for dioxin reducing initiatives, the scheme is often used for assessing health risks. Environment Canada has officially adopted the WHO scheme for managing human health risks for dioxins in food, water, air and consumer products; Canadian soil quality guidelines also use the WHO scheme (CCME, 2002). The WHO scheme for the quantification of dioxin congeners remains one of the WHO's main international dioxin-based initiatives.

1.3.2. WHO dioxin initiatives The first WH 0 TEF values introduced in 1994 were identical to I-TEF values but they also included TEF values for dioxin-like PCBs after a need was identified to characterize them (A.J. Chandler, 2006). They were re-evaluated twice - once in 1998 (WH098 values) and again in 2005 (WH005 values). The 1998 re-evaluation removed the di-ortho PCB TEF values,

readjusted some mammalian TEF values and introduced TEF values specifically for birds and fish (Van den Berg et al., 2005). The 2005 re-evaluation altered some TEF values based on further scientific studies and switched the TEFs to a logarithmic scale (Van den Berg et al., 2005). WH094, WH098 and WH005 TEF values are given in Table 3.

The development of these new TEF values was done through the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS). In addition to the IPCS, the WHO has other international dioxin

programs. Several are listed on their website (WHO, 2007). These include a comprehensive risk

like PCB Contamination in Foods and Feed (F AO/WHO, 2006) and an estimate of the tolerable
daily intake (TDI) for humans (WHO, 1998). The WHO has also collaborated with the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) on implementation of the Stockholm Convention, which is dedicated to reducing emissions of persistent organic pollutants and completing estimates of dioxin releases from every region across the globe (UNEP, 2003). The global report is based on emission estimates and environmental guidelines of each specific country. Since many countries lack the technology and resources needed to estimate and regulate dioxin emissions, their emissions are not suitably quantified in the UNEP report. For other countries, including Canada, dioxin emissions are well documented. Canadian estimates are made through annual NPRI reporting and the Canada-Wide Standards for Dioxins and Furans (UNEP, 2002).

1.3.3.1.

Scope and development

The development of the CWS for dioxins and furans stem from the findings of the 1990 Priority Substances List (PSL 1) - a list made collaboratively by Environment Canada and Health Canada (Environment Canada, 1990). The PSL 1 report on dioxins presents findings on the properties of dioxins, their sources, environmental fate, toxicological effects, ecosystem impact and environmental and human health risks. Their findings emphasize four crucial properties of

dioxins; they are persistent in the environment, they bioaccumulate in the food chain, they are largely anthropogenic and they are toxic as defined by the Canadian Environmental Protection

Act (CEPA, 1999).

These four characteristics of dioxins make them eligible for the Toxic

a policy instrument

The Toxic Substances Management Policy (TSMP) has designated dioxins as Track 1 Substances, which means that they should be 'virtually eliminated' in Canada. The term 'Virtual Elimination' is used by CEP A to signify that the use and emission of a pollutant should be reduced down to the lowest level of quantitation (LLOQ) - the lowest level measurable by routine analysis. The LLOQ for dioxins found in air is 32 pgTEQ m- 3 and in soil, it is 9 pgTEQ g-1 (CCME, 2004). Methods on how to reach a virtual elimination of dioxin emissions is

quantified by the 2001 Canadian Wide Standards (CWS) for Dioxins and Furans (CCME, 2001). The CWS has set reduction goals for certain targeted dioxin sources in the hopes that these targets will be met within the given timeframe and be made more stringent until Virtual Elimination is achieved. These sources are waste incineration (municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, sewage sludge and medical waste); burning salt laden wood in coastal pulp and paper boilers in British Columbia; residential wood combustion; iron sintering; electric arc furnace steel manufacturing; and conical municipal waste combustion in Newfoundland (CCME, 2001). Initial estimates predicted that eliminating dioxin releases from these sources would reduce dioxin emissions by 80% (CCME, 2001 ). achieving Virtual Elimination. This would mark substantial progress towards

Achieving a virtual elimination of dioxin emissions is not just important in terms of following the precautionary principles outlined in CEPA but it is also important in order to meet the recommendations made in the Canadian soil quality guidelines for dioxins (CCME, 2002).

14

CHAPTER ONE These guidelines state that since the most sensitive receptors (toddlers and infants) currently have an estimated daily intake of dioxin (EDI) that exceeds their tolerable daily intake (TDI), it is recommended that dioxin levels be reduced down to 4 pgTEQ

the natural Canadian

dioxin background level. In other words, it is necessary to virtually eliminate dioxins from the environment. While the CWS have made progress in reaching Virtual Elimination, several

deficiencies will prevent them from fully eliminating dioxin releases.

1.3.3.2.

Deficiencies in the CWS and a solution

Two major deficiencies that exist within the CWS prevent them from reaching Virtual Elimination; they do not address the 80o/o of Canadian dioxin emissions as initially claimed and the sources that are addressed have stalled in their attempts to reach Virtual Elimination. While the six targeted dioxin sources were initially estimated to release 80o/o of all Canadian dioxin emissions, in reality they only account for approximately 56% of 1999 atmospheric releases (CCME, 2004). The discrepancy is due to the quantification of additional sources of dioxin emissions. Of the remaining 44o/o, the 2004 CCME report predicts that 15% are currently

controlled through other initiatives and the remainder, which is released through combustion of fuel and the burning of residential and municipal waste, goes completely unregulated. What is perhaps more troubling is the lack of testing and research for many sectors that have the potential of being significant dioxin emitters. These potential sources include but are not limited to

asphalt plants, magnesium production, petroleum refineries, crematoria and secondary copper smelting (CCME, 2004). The 2004 report by the CCME recommends that:

Industry, governments and other stakeholders should undertake cooperative scientific research programs to characterize smelter releases, validate predictive models, investigate

15

CHAPTER ONE
environmental behaviours and effects, and identify and develop pollution prevention opportunities and technologies.

The creation of scientific research programs and the development of pollution prevention technologies will not only help identify other dioxin sources but will also help the sources currently targeted by the CWS reach their goal of Virtual Elimination.

The interim targets and the progresses of the sources currently targeted by the CWS are summarized in Table 4.

CHAPTER ONE The majority of the six targeted dioxin sources have been at least partially successful in reaching the interim goals set up by the CWS. However, with the exception of Electric Arc Furnaces, which have been very successful in eliminating dioxin releases and Conical Waste Combustors, which will reduce dioxins through a phase-out, all other existing sources would benefit from additional source testing to better quantify dioxin releases. They would also benefit from an increase in the validation of new pollution prevention technologies. New pollution prevention technologies would be especially useful because they can not only allow sources to meet interim targets but can contribute to the advancement of interim targets towards the eventual goal of Virtual Elimination.

The maJor obstacle in increasing source testing and validating new pollution prevention technologies is the limited capacity of dioxin testing facilities. For instance, an external review of the successes of the CWS for Canadian incinerators has suggested that many small incinerators in fact meet the specifications that require them to be tested for dioxin emissions but a lack of testing capacity and the high cost of doing so makes it unlikely to ever happen (A.J. Chandler, 2006). It is also reasonable to conclude that if this is the case, then the extensive testing that would be required to validate new pollution prevention technologies would also be difficult to complete.

Currently, dioxin testing is done through use of gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectroscopy (GC-HRMS) as it is highly accurate and can provide concentrations for each of the 17 most toxic dioxin and furan congeners in only one analysis. The basic concept of GC-HRMS is described in Reiner et al., 2006. Dioxin and other organics are extracted three times from the

18

CHAPTER ONE sample matrix. The extract is then run through a series of cleanup columns, which can include silica, alumina and reversed-phased HPLC; each targets specific contaminants for removal (Chen, 2008). Using gas chromatographic columns, the dioxin congeners are separated from the remaining co-extractants and are eluted sequentially starting with the tetrachlorinated followed by the penta-, hexa-, hepta- and octachlorinated congeners (Reiner et al., 2006). The elutes are then fed through a mass spectrometer that records the molecular fragments of the congeners. The mass spectrometer gives output on quantities of all dioxin and furan congeners within the sample and using mathematical software, the amounts of the 17 most toxic dioxin and furan congeners can be inferred.

The problem with using GC-HRMS is that it is cost-prohibitive, very time-consuming and requires highly trained personnel. If GC-HRMS is to be used for increased source testing and more technology validation, some of the testing currently being handled by GC-HRMS should be offset to newer technologies that prove to be either less expensive, faster, or both. One new technology that has been shown to have distinct advantages over GC-HRMS in these respects is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

1.4.

ELISA

1.4.1. Comparisons to GC-HRMS

ELISA is a technology that has numerous uses including testing for HIV, pregnancy, anabolic steroids, illicit drugs and other toxins in food, blood and tissue (Kimball, 2008). The use of ELISA for dioxin screening is relatively new and ELISA would have both advantages and disadvantages in comparison to GC-HRMS. The use of ELISA is advantageous since it has the

19

CHAPTER ONE capability of being a faster and less expensive alternative to GC-HRMS. The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), under its Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation Program, has examined the use of an ELISA produced by Cape Technologies (cape-tech.com) to detect dioxins in soils and sediments. By testing the ability of ELISA to screen for dioxins in 209 soil and sediment samples, the US EPA concluded that Cape Technologies ELISA kits would have the time and cost advantages over US EPA Methods 1613B and 1668A (which use GC-HRMS) shown in Table 5.

The cost and time saving advantages of ELISA shown here may be slightly exaggerated (as demonstrated in Section 2.2 of this thesis) but the fact remains that the technology is much less expensive and faster than GC-HRMS analysis. ELISA is also much simpler to operate and does not need PhD level personnel. However, due to the nature of the technology, an ELISA analysis is capable of only reporting the total TEQ of the sample whereas a GC-HRMS analysis can report the concentrations of the 17 most toxic dioxin and furan congeners. concentrations, the total TEQ of the sample is calculated. With these

False positive values are presented as the percentage of samples within range of a threshold value that ELISA detects as being above the threshold but GC-HRMS detects as being below.

The findings of the US EPA Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation report conclude that while there are both time and cost advantages in using ELISA, the technique does have its drawbacks. The inability of the US EPA to reach the ideal values listed in Table 6 indicates that

22

CHAPTER ONE it is less accurate and less sensitive than its GC-HRMS counterpart. However, the accuracy of ELISA demonstrated by both Cape Technologies and the US EPA could potentially be improved by using a correction factor that is discussed in Section 2.1 of this thesis. The discrepancy between the ELISA results obtained by the US EPA and the Cape Technologies product specifications highlights the fact that running a successful ELISA is dependant on many variables; changes in factors such as the technique of the operator and the conditions of the laboratory set-up can have large effects on the results obtained. Finally, it should be emphasized again that ELISA is only capable of reporting the total TEQ of a sample whereas GC-HRMS is capable of reporting congener specific concentrations.

It is clear from characteristics of ELISA that it cannot serve as a complete replacement to GC-

HRMS. This is especially true for instances such as the routine testing of stack emissions, where ELISA would lack the necessary sensitivity or in the validation of new dioxin prevention technologies, where ELISA would not have adequate accuracy. However, ELISA can excel in one very important area; it can act as an initial screening tool that can offset much of the burden on GC-HRMS. In fact, the 2005a US EPA report notes that ELISA has the potential of

screening for dioxins at 20 pgTEQ g· 1 and 50 pgTEQ g-1 -levels that are in range for the testing of dioxins in soil. ELISA can therefore complement GC-HRMS as a site assessment tool. The efficiency of ELISA analysis can be exploited to quickly and extensively map a site in terms of what areas are clean and what areas are most contaminated. Clean-up efforts can be better focused, the remediation of the site can be hastened and GC-HRMS can be made more available for high priority soil sampling, more routine dioxin source testing and the validation of new dioxin reducing technologies.

23

CHAPTER ONE

1.4.2. Description of ELISA technology
The principles behind ELISA are described In an ELISA kit insert provided by Cape Technologies (Cape-Tech, 2003b ). ELISA works by binding dioxins dissolved in methanol to anti-dioxin antibodies that are coated on an immunoassay tube. The anti-dioxin antibodies

specifically target 2,3,7,8-TCDD and they do so by shape recognition. The other congeners, which all have a similar shape to 2,3,7,8-TCDD are also targeted by the antibodies but to differing degrees. The degree of reaction between a particular congener and the anti-dioxin

antibodies is known as its cross reactivity. The concept of cross reactivity is discussed in further detail in Section 2.1. Once the dioxins are bound to the coated surface of the immunoassay tube, the unbound material is washed away and a competitor-HorseRadish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugate is added to the tube. The competitor is a dioxin molecule chemically conjugated to the HRP enzyme. The competitor occupies the remaining antibody sites that are not taken up by dioxin molecules. Hence, the amount of bound competitor-HRP is inversely proportional to the amount of bound dioxin. The tube is allowed to incubate after which the unbound excess

competitor is washed away. A solution containing a peroxide and a chromogen is then added. The peroxidase enzyme cleaves the peroxide substrate to liberate oxygen radical which oxidizes the colourless chromogen to its coloured form . The colour intensity is dependant on the amount of bound competitor-HRP and therefore is inversely proportional to the amount of bound dioxin. Finally, a stop solution is added to halt and stabilize the colour change. The colour intensity, or optical density (OD), is measured spectrophotometrically as absorbance. The ELISA process is depicted in Figure 2.

Once the OD reading for each sample is measured from the spectrophotometer, they are converted into a TEQ value. The conversion requires the development of a relationship curve

25

CHAPTER ONE between OD readings and TEQ values. This curve is made by fitting a series of standard and negative control (NC) OD readings to a four-parameter equation using Microsoft Excel's solver function in a spreadsheet provided by Cape Technologies (Cape-Tech, 2004). parameter equation is as follows: The four

Values for A, B, C and D are found automatically through the Microsoft Excel solver function in the spreadsheet provided by Cape Technologies.

1.4.3. Current state of ELISA technology
As mentioned in Section 1.4.1, the US EPA has shown that ELISA has the potential of screening for dioxins in soil. In fact, these findings have translated into the US EPA Method 4025 - an officially approved method that uses Cape Technology ELISA kits to screen for dioxins at 500 pgTEQ g- 1 (US EPA, 2002). Generally speaking, validation of this method in Canada would be required before ELISA is widely accepted by Canadian institutions. The validation would

involve the formal licensing and accreditation of ELISA in established laboratories. This thesis takes the first steps towards validation. Other academic papers have also tested the use of

ELISA to screen for dioxins in soil. Nording et al., 2007; Nording et al., 2006; Nichkova, 2004 and Shan et al., 2001 all have studied this use of ELISA; however, their sample sizes were small

26

CHAPTER ONE (n=15, n=10, n=12 and n=6, respectively) and their findings were very preliminary. Van Emon et al., 2008 offers a more complete study of ELISA as a screen for dioxins in soil. This paper analyzed in triplicate 75 soil samples from a Superfund site in Rhode Island, USA by both ELISA and GC-HRMS. The comparison of both techniques gave very favourable results; the standard deviation of the triplicate ELISA results for each sample was ±20%, ELISA results were on average only 12°/o higher than those of GC-HRMS, FP and FN rates were 6.7% and 8.0o/o respectively at 1,000 pgTEQ g- and the correlation between both methods was strong (r = 0. 79). Their study concluded that ELISA could be used as a complementary screening process at 1,000 pgTEQ g- 1·
1

While these studies confirm that ELISA can be used as a screening tool, several aspects of the ELISA method can still be improved. The van Emon et al., 2008 study, the Nording et al., 2007 study and the Nording et al., 2006 study all acknowledge that differences in how ELISA and GCHRMS calculate TEQ mean that both methods produce results that are only approximately equal to the other. The van Emon et al., 2008 study emphasizes this fact by reporting ELISA TEQ values in terms of an 'ELISA-EQ'. Furthermore, all aforementioned studies have depended on prior analysis by GC-HRMS to provide the samples' dioxin concentrations and congener profiles; no studies were found that discussed the use of ELISA to analyze soil samples that have not been previously analyzed by GC-HRMS. This is an issue because dioxin levels in soil can range anywhere from the Canadian background level of 4 pgTEQ g- (CCME, 2002) to over 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1
-

the maximum dioxin concentration level that can be reached in Ontario

before remediation is required (OMOE, 1996). No literature was found that discussed how to

27

CHAPTER ONE overcome the fact that one ELISA test would be inadequate to determine a dioxin concentration that could fall anywhere across this range.

The following Method Development Section will introduce and develop two new concepts that overcome these problems. A correction factor that accounts for the differences in how ELISA and GC-HRMS convert values to TEQ and a method of determining how the correction factor can be calculated for a site are discussed in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 describes a sample

algorithm that details how to efficiently introduce a sufficient amount of dioxin into an ELISA tube from a sample with an unknown dioxin concentration. Section 2.3 addresses the need to account for background dioxin concentration when analysing and reporting ELISA results. These improvements to the ELISA procedure will be tested in Section 3 by using ELISA to analyze soil and sediment samples from a dioxin contaminated site and comparing those results to GC-HRMS. If these new concepts are found to be sound then they will contribute to the advancement of ELISA technology and allow it to replace GC-HRMS for the routine screening of soil and sediment samples.

It should be noted that Nording et al., 2007 also offers a method to correct for the differences in

how ELISA and GC-HRMS convert values to TEQ.

However, their method is simply to

multiply the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS for a group of samples from the same site by the inverse slope to get a correlation for that dataset that is closer to 1. This is not an ideal correction method since it is entirely empirical and depends on having a strong enough dataset to generate a reasonable slope. It cannot be used for individual samples or small datasets.

METHOD DEVELOPMENT

2.1.

The Congener Correction Factor

ELISA works by capturing analytes using antibodies, which are already bound to the surface of an ELISA tube. For this particular ELISA, the target analyte is 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Molecules with a similar shape (the other dioxin and furan congeners) will also bind to the antibodies but to differing degrees. The degree of binding for a particular congener is known as its cross

reactivity. The percent cross reactivity values for various dioxin and furan congeners (and some PCBs) for the ELISA developed by Cape Technologies are provided in Table 7. Cross reactivity values for these congeners and PCBs were determined experimentally by Cape Technologies (Cape-Tech, 2003b) by dividing the result of an ELISA analysis of a pure sample of 2,3,7,8TCDD by the result of an ELISA analysis of a pure sample of each congener at the same concentration. trials.

CHAPTER TWO Since GC-HRMS dioxin results are always reported in TEQ, ELISA results are also reported in equivalent amounts of 2,3, 7,8-TCDD and cross reactivity values are set relative to the cross reactivity of2,3,7,8-TCDD. One of the fundamental differences between GC-HRMS and ELISA is that GC-HRMS results report congener concentrations which must be each multiplied by the corresponding TEF value to get TEQ whereas ELISA results (which are reported as 2,3,7,8TCDD equivalents) already account for the cross reactivity of the congeners; the congener concentrations themselves cannot be determined.

The polyclonal antibody used for the Cape Technologies ELISA was selected since it had congener cross reactivity values that approximate their respective TEF values. Therefore, cross reactivity values roughly represent the relative toxicity of each congener. Since cross reactivity values are only roughly equal to both NATO and WHO derived TEF values, GC-HRMS TEQ and ELISA results are not entirely comparable. For some congeners, the difference between cross reactivity and TEF is negligible but for others, the difference is distinct. For instance, 2,3,4, 7,8-pentachloro dibenzofuran (PeCDF) has a cross reactivity of 0.17 but its NATO derived TEF is 0.5. If a sample of pure 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF was analyzed by both ELISA and GC-HRMS, the ELISA result would underestimate the GC-HRMS TEQ by 66%. The congener correction factor proposed below will correct for this discrepancy.

The correction factor will allow for a direct comparison between ELISA results and GC-HRMS TEQ. Since GC-HRMS and ELISA use different methods to convert dioxin and furan congeners into equivalent amounts of 2,3,7,8-TCDD, only the concentrations of the congeners themselves

31

CHAPTER TWO are directly comparable. Assuming a sample is composed of pure 'Congener A', its

concentration can be determined from an ELISA result as follows:

[c ongener A] =

ELISA TCDD Eqmvalents . Cross reactivity A

(Eq. 2a)

With GC-HRMS, the concentration of Congener A is measured directly and can be equated to the TEQ of the sample as follows:

GC-HRMSTEQ [Congener A ] = - - - - - TEFA
Setting Eq. 2a equal to Eq. 2b,

An ELISA result for a sample composed of a single congener is thus corrected by multiplying the uncorrected ELISA result by the congener's TEF and dividing by its cross reactivity. This corrected ELISA result is now directly comparable to GC-HRMS TEQ.

The term 'correction factor' will herein refer to TEF-:- (cross reactivity). NATO TEF values for each congener are given in Table 2, WHO TEF are given in Table 3 and cross reactivity values

32

CHAPTER TWO are given in Table 7. The congener corrected ELISA will not only be directly comparable to GC-HRMS TEQ results but it will also be more comparable to all dioxin environmental regulations since regulations use TEF values to convert dioxin concentrations into TEQ.

On a side-note, this congener correction factor shows promise for other similar ELISA applications. For instance, Abraxis LLC (abraxiskits.com) produces an ELISA kit that semiquantitatively screens for PCBs in soil, sediment, fish tissue and other matrices. Abraxis LLC also identifies that their kit only approximates the GC-MS derived PCB TEQ of a sample due to differences between cross reactivity and PCB TEF values (US EPA, 2005c ). The concept of the correction factor can be equally applied to solve the problem of discrepancy between PCB ELISA and GC-MS.

Applying the correction factor to real samples, such as soils and sediments, poses a challenge since they are composed of numerous congeners, each with their own cross reactivity and TEF value. This problem has been resolved by introducing the concept of 'composite cross

reactivity' to complement the existing concept of 'composite TEF'. Composite cross reactivity and TEF values can be calculated by multiplying the individual cross reactivity and TEF values for each congener in a sample by its percent composition and summing the results. By using the resulting composite TEF and composite cross reactivity values, the correction factor in Equation 2d can be used for samples with congener mixtures. The calculations (shown in Table 8) of composite cross reactivity values, composite TEF values, and the resulting correction factor require only the percent composition of the sample in question. The sample calculations in Table 8 are for one of twenty-seven soil samples provided by the MOE that are used in Section 3 of

33

CHAPTER TWO this thesis. The method shown in Table 8 is the one used to calculate all correction factors found in this thesis. For example, it has been used to generate the correction factors for the 30 emission sources found in Tables 10 and 11.

In the example shown in Table 8, the correction factor is quite close to unity. What this implies is that when all congeners are considered simultaneously, discrepancies between TEF and cross reactivity values (such as the one mentioned previously for 2,3,4,7 ,8-PeCDF) may be effectively evened out or found inconsequential. ELISA results would not have to be corrected and could be compared directly to GC-HRMS TEQ. However, the question remains as to whether or not

34

CHAPTER TWO some congener profiles will produce correction factors that differ significantly from unity and thus would require their usage when comparing ELISA results to GC-HRMS. To answer this question, congener profiles of several different dioxin sources were examined.

2.1.1. Source specific congener profiles
Average congener profiles of several dioxin sources were obtained through the Database of

Sources of Environmental Releases of Dioxin-like Compounds in the United States (NCEA,
2001 ). Database information for each source type was collected from various facilities across the United States as of 1995 - the latest year that could be consistently evaluated for the given facilities. This data, which is composed of emission testing results on the quantity of the 17 toxic dioxin and furan congeners that have measured TEF values, were used to develop source specific emission factors and thus estimates on the quantity of dioxin emitted from each source. While the database states that the quantity of emissions has been significantly reduced since 1995, the information found in the database will only be used to obtain the congener profile of each source (i.e. the congener percent composition of the dioxin being released) and not the quantity of dioxin released. Table 9 lists the sources that were included in the NCEA database.

Based on the congener profiles provided by the dioxin database, applying a correction factor will be necessary when using ELISA on samples originating from the majority of the listed sources. Uncorrected ELISA results can range anywhere from underreporting a sample's TEQ by 63% (Secondary Copper Refinery) to over-reporting TEQ by 36% (Combustion of Landfill Gas). Use of the correction factor will correct for these discrepancies. Interestingly, it seems that an

uncorrected ELISA will generally underreport dioxin concentrations as 'Combustion of Landfill Gas' is the only source with a congener profile that will lead to a significant over-reporting. However, it must be emphasized that this finding is only true for the Cape Technologies ELISA. The ELISA used by other laboratories may use other polyclonal antibodies and thus would have different cross reactivity values. Therefore, new correction factors must be determined for

different ELISA in order to compare those ELISA to GC-HRMS.

It is important to point out that the listed source-specific correction factors are not intended to be

used quantitatively. Each site will have its own unique congener profile and this profile can be used to calculate a site-specific correction factor. The term 'site-specific correction factor' was

38

CHAPTER TWO previously coined by Nording et al., 2007 however as discussed previously their correction factor is rather different.

Certain assumptions are required to form the basis for the use of a site-specific correction factor. The congener profile of the contaminated site is assumed to remain roughly consistent across the site. That is to say, the congener profiles of each sample would be roughly but not exactly equal. This assumption is known to hold true when the site has a single source of dioxin emission (OMOE, 2007). This assumption may also hold true for sites with multiple sources of dioxin emissions if the combined emissions produce a congener profile that has little variability. To state this assumption in other words, it is assumed that a site can have a wide range of different dioxin concentrations but that the congener profile (or percent composition) of the site's samples will remain roughly consistent. This assumption can be verified by running GC-HRMS on

samples from a particular site to ensure that there are no differences in congener profiles.

The site-specific congener profile is an average of the congener profiles of every sample taken from the site. However, this approach would require GC-HRMS analysis on each sample from the site as it is the only technique that gives congener concentrations. ELISA would become dependent on GC-HRMS analysis and the benefits of using ELISA as a way to reduce the burden on GC-HRMS would effectively be lost. A practical solution to this problem would be to

calculate a site-wide average congener profile based on the fewest number of GC-HRMS analyses.
It therefore becomes a question of knowing how many GC-HRMS analyses are

necessary to calculate an average congener profile that reasonably resembles the actual site-wide average congener profile.

39

CHAPTER TWO In order to calculate an average site-wide congener profile, the average percent composition of each congener must be known. With the assumption that a site has a single, average congener profile and that each sample taken from that site has a profile that is similar to this average value, it follows that each congener in a sample should have a statistical distribution about the site's average value for that same congener. The primary objective becomes how to determine the fewest number of GC-HRMS analyses needed to calculate an average site-wide congener profile that is reasonably close to its true value. 'Reasonably close' will be defined as ±5% of its true value. To accomplish this objective, a two-stage process is required. The first stage, expanded upon in Section 2.1.2 is to determine which type of statistical distribution best represents the congener percent compositions of samples collected from a particular site. This first stage is necessary for the correct determination of the fewest number of GC-HRMS analyses needed, which is the second stage (Section 2.1.3).

2.1.2. Method of determining the distribution type that best represents the congener percent compositions of samples collected from a particular site
The reasoning behind needing to determine the distribution type is as follows. The formula used to calculate an average percent composition for each congener will be different depending on which distribution type best fits the data. For instance, the average value, or mean, of a normal distribution is calculated as

whereas for a lognormal distribution, the mean value is calculated as (Eq. 4)

40

CHAPTER TWO where Jl and a are the mean and standard deviation of normally distributed ln(x) (NIST/SEMA TECH, 2008e).

Distributions of the percent compositions for each of the 17 reported dioxin and furan congeners were examined for 25 soil samples provided by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) from a site with an unknown source of dioxin contamination. These samples had a wide range of dioxin concentrations (11 - 27,000 pgTEQ g1 )

and were sampled at several sampling points

about the site, making them an ideal dataset to test whether or not the congener percent compositions of samples taken at a site can be fitted to a particular distribution type. Methodology to determine the ideal distribution type of this dataset was adapted from several sections of the NIST/SEMA TECH e-handbook of Statistical Methods (NIST/SEMA TECH, 2008a). The first step was to run a Tukey-Lambda analysis.

2.1.2.1.

Tukey-Lambda analysis

The Tukey-Lambda plot gives an initial estimate of the distribution type that best fits a dataset.
It plots Tukey-Lambda probability plot correlation coefficients on the y-axis against the different

shape parameters that are used to make up these probability plots on the x-axis (NIST/SEMATECH, 2008b ). The optimal shape parameter will be the one that produces the highest probability plot correlation coefficient and as such will indicate which type of distribution best fits the data. Optimal shape parameters (A.) of a Tukey-Lambda plot relate to distribution types as shown in Table 12.

Footnotes: 1. To calculate a site-averaged composition, it was assumed for the time being that the congeners are no1mally distributed. 2. The balded entries indicate where the highest correlation coefficient value falls. Where two values are balded, the maximum value falls between the two distribution types.

44

CHAPTER TWO The results show that 14 of the 17 congeners (98.8o/o of the average sample composition) are best fit to either an approximately normal or a uniform distribution. Both of these distributions are considered equivalent for the purposes of this analysis since they would both use the same formula for determining average congener profile values. While the percent composition

distributions of three congeners do not fit a normal distribution very well, they make up less than 2% of the average sample composition for the MOE site.

Although Tukey-Lambda has determined that the data is near normal, it does not distinguish between a normal distribution and a lognormal distribution. While the difference between the two may seem trivial, many environmental samples show lognormal behaviour (Limpert et al., 2001) and even dioxin concentrations in soil have been suggested to be distributed lognormally (van Emon et. al, 2008). Whether or not the distribution of a congener's percent composition is better fit to a normal or a lognormal distribution can be determined by using a lognormal probability plot correlation coefficient (PPCC) plot to determine the ideal lognormal shape parameter.

2.1.2.2.

Determining the idea/lognormal shape parameter

In a lognormal PPCC plot, the "lognormal probability plot correlation coefficients" are plotted on the y-axis and the lognormal shape parameters that are used to create them are plotted on the x-axis (NIST/SEMATECH, 2008c). The shape parameter with the highest correlation If the

coefficient will be the ideal lognormal shape parameter for that particular dataset.

optimum correlation coefficient of the lognormal PPCC plot is at zero then the data is best fit to a normal distribution. Figure 4 shows the lognormal PPCC plots for I ,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD on the left and 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF on the right. The left figure indicates that 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD is

As mentioned above, the "lognormal probability plot correlation coefficients" are plotted on the y-axis of the lognormal PPCC plot. Values for the "lognormal probability plot correlation

coefficients" are generated as follows. A lognormal probability plot is generated for each shape parameter. For example, a series of shape parameter values ranging from 0.1 to 5 with

increments of 0.1 will generate a total number of 50 lognormal probability plots. On each plot, the x-axis is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the lognormal distribution evaluated at the "normalized ordered statistic medians" (defined below). The y-axis is the congener percent composition dataset ranked in increasing order. Each plot generates a correlation coefficient for that particular shape parameter. The distribution is considered to be a good fit for the dataset when the lognormal probability plot shows a linear line with a strong correlation coefficient.

CHAPTER TWO A probability plot for 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD evaluated at its optimal lognormal shape parameter of 0 (i.e. a normal distribution) is shown in Figure 5. The resulting r-squared value of 0.97308 provides the first data point on Figure 4a. The remaining datapoints in Figure 4a were provided by similar procedures with different shape parameters. Datapoints in Figure 4b are obtained by applying the same procedure to the 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF percent composition dataset.

The "normalized ordered statistic medians" (or mi) needed to generate a lognormal probability plot are the medians between the ith-ordered datapoint and the location of where the ith datapoint should be on a normal probability plot (Filliben, 1975). In general, probability plots can be created for any distribution where the inverse cumulative distribution function is known (NIST/SEMATECH, 2008d).

The final step of stage one - the determination of the type of statistical distribution for the 17 congeners - is as follows. Lognormal PPCC plots (as illustrated by two congeners in Figure 4a and 4b, respectively) were generated for the distribution of the remaining 15 toxic congeners' percent compositions. summarized in Table 15. Optimal lognormal shape parameters were calculated and then

Table 15 shows that seven congeners are best fit to a normal distribution and ten are best fit to lognormal distributions with varying shape parameters. The ideal situation would be if each congener assumed a normal distribution because in this case, the optimal shape parameter would not have to be determined. The entire objective of examining which distribution best describes the site-wide spread of a congener's percent composition is to determine how to calculate the congener's site-wide average percent composition. Therefore, the average composition for the least normally distributed (i.e. the most lognormally distributed) congener, 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF was calculated by using both the normal and lognormal methods of calculating an average value. This is shown in Table 16. If the estimation of the average value calculated both ways is

The results in Table 16 demonstrate that the two methods both give similar estimates for the average composition of the most lognormally distributed congener. Therefore, the conclusion of stage one is that all congeners can be treated as normally distributed. necessary for progression into stage two (Section 2.1.3). This conclusion is

2.1.3. Determining the fewest required number ofGC-HRMS analyses
This section will determine the fewest number of GC-HRMS analyses necessary to calculate a site-wide average congener profile that would be sufficiently close to the best estimate of the site's actual average congener profile. With this average congener profile, an average site-wide correction factor can be calculated that can be applied to all ELISA results from that site. Before calculating an average congener profile, the distribution of the percent compositions of each congener had to be determined. From the statistics provided in the previous sections, it was found that the distribution of the congener percent compositions of the 25 provided samples from the MOE site could suitably be treated as normal. As such the average value for each congener percent composition is calculated as

CHAPTER TWO The best estimate of the average site-wide congener profile for the MOE site was considered to be the average congener profile calculated using all 25 provided samples. This profile and its associated correction factor are given in Table 17.

Therefore, the best estimate of the actual site-wide correction factor is 1.0952.

In order to

determine the fewest number of samples needed to be analyzed by GC-HRMS in order to obtain a site-wide correction factor that is sufficiently similar to 1.0952, average congener profiles were calculated for randomly generated sample sets of n= 1,2,3,4, ... ,25 samples taken from the 25 available samples. Each of these sample sets was randomly generated 200 times from the 25 available samples and was used to calculate an estimate of the site-wide correction factor. The methodology on how this is accomplished is explained in Appendix A. The 200 correction

Sample size
Figure 6. Correction factors for the 200 datasets at samples sizes n=1,2,3, ... ,25

From the spearhead shape of Figure 6, it can be concluded that running too few GC-HRMS analyses to create a site-side correction factor can lead to a correction factor that varies too much from the best estimate of its actual value. Running too many GC-HRMS analyses is also not beneficial because exceeding a certain sample size will no longer appreciably change the average site-wide correction factor. To quantify this observation, the site-wide correction factor was

considered acceptably close to the best estimate of its actual value once it was ±5o/o of 1.0952. In order to determine how many samples will be needed to meet this criterion, the
standan~

deviation of the spread of data for each sample size was calculated. Since the data spreads at each sample size were found to be normally distributed (by running a Tukey-Lambda analysis)

52

CHAPTER TWO and based on the fact that 95o/o of the data from a normal distribution falls within two standard deviations (Moore and McCabe, 1999), Figure 7 was generated.

Sample size
Figure 7. Two standard deviations of the spread of correction factors at each sample size

The ±5% cut-off line intercepts two standard deviations at a sample size of 7. Therefore by running GC-HRMS on 7 samples and using their averaged congener profile to create a site-wide correction factor, one can be 95% confident that the resulting correction factor will be within 5% of the best estimate of its actual value. While the requirement of 7 samples is ultimately a function of the size of the dataset (the 25 soil samples) from which they would be selected, it is likely that after a certain dataset size is reached, the number of required samples would not change.

53

CHAPTER TWO
It should be emphasized that the requirement of 7 GC-HRMS samples to produce a site-wide

correction factor is only valid for soils from this particular site. Factors such as different soil types, different congener profiles and different distributions types for the percent compositions of each congener will alter the number of required samples. The method of estimating the

number of samples required to calculate a site-wide correction factor is therefore meant only as a template. Comparisons between a number of sites, their specific characteristics and how they contribute to different estimations of the number of GC-HRMS samples needed for a site-wide correction factor is beyond the scope of this thesis. However, for the purposes of method

validation, the number of GC-HRMS samples needed for a site-wide correction factor was again determined for another sample set comprising 30 dioxin contaminated sediments from the same site. Although the 25 soil samples and 30 sediment samples were from the same site, they were not combined to estimate the number of samples needed for a site-wide correction factor since the different characteristics between soils and sediments could potentially lead to them having widely different dioxin congener profiles.

2.1.4. Calculating a site-wide correction factor using a different sample set
The methodology detailed in Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 is briefly summarized in Table 18 on the next page. It will be repeated for the 30 sediment sample set. Table 19 gives the results of the Tukey-Lambda analysis for the congener profiles of the 17 toxic congeners found in the sediment samples.

However, 91% of the data has a high correlation coefficient value of at least 0.93 suggesting that most of the congeners can fit a near-normal distribution.

PPCC plots were then generated for each congener to determine if the data is better suited to a normal distribution or a lognormal one. The resulting shape parameters are listed in Table 20.

As was done for the sample set of 25 soil samples, the fewest' number of GC-HRMS samples needed was determined by looking at the intercept between the lines of± 2 standard deviations of the distribution at each sample size and ± 5% of the actual site-wide correction factor. Figure 9 shows that the intercept between the ±2 standard deviation line and the ±5% line intersect between sample sizes of one and two.

Figure 9. Two standard deviations of the spread of correction factors at each sample size

The need of only two GC-HRMS sediment samples to calculate a site-wide correction factor for sediments taken from this site indicates that all of these sediments share a more uniform or homogeneous congener profile. In contrast, the soils samples exhibited a more heterogeneous congener profile. Three processes can contribute to this difference. The first process is

photodegradation. Air emissions of dioxin are deposited on soils. Photodegradation can cause the breakdown of congeners in the soil, exposed to sunlight (lsosaari et al. , 2004). Sunlight is less accessible to sediments. The second process is mixing. When soils eventually get washed into local waters and become sediments, mixing can occur which can increase homogeneity. The third process involves the selective solubility of various congeners in water (hydrophilicity). Higher chlorinated congeners will have slightly more ionic features (due to the greater degree 9f substitution around the dibenzo core) and thus may be more likely to dissolve and be washed

60

CHAPTER TWO away by water, which is polar. One could hypothesize that sediments would be richer in

concentrations of the lower chlorinated congeners.

The dichotomy of congener abundance between soils and sediments is examined in light of the above mixing and hydrophilicity hypotheses. The average percent compositions of each

dioxin/furan homologue (i.e. group of congeners with the same level of chlorination) are plotted in Figure 10 to test the hydrophilicity hypothesis. If the hydrophilicity hypothesis is true, the sediments should exhibit a shift in congener abundance towards the lesser chlorinated homologues since the higher chlorinated homologues are dissolved away. The mixing

hypothesis is tested by comparing the magnitude of error bars (±1 standard deviation), which is a measure of homogeneity. If the mixing hypothesis is true, the sediments must have smaller error bars for each and every single homologue.

CHAPTER TWO Figure 10 provides evidence that both hypotheses are true. The mixing hypothesis is confirmed since the congener profiles of sediments are indeed more homogeneous than soils; for each and every homologue the standard deviation of the sediments is always smaller than that of the soils. The hydrophilicity hypothesis is confirmed since the sediments are, to a certain extent, more abundant in lower chlorinated homologues. That is, sediments are composed of fewer

octachlorinated congeners in comparison to soils and they are most abundant in hexachlorinated congeners. Conversely, soils are most abundant in octachlorinated congeners. The least No

abundant of the 5 dioxin homologues are the penta- and tetrachlorinated congeners.

difference is observed in their relative abundance, perhaps because they have the lowest level of chlorination and thus would be least likely to dissolve in water.

The above findings have the following practical implications. Since sediments have a smaller distribution of congeners and a greater homogeneity, ELISA may be more amenable to screening for dioxins in sediment samples. More homogeneity in sample composition implies that fewer initial GC-HRMS analyses are required to develop a site-specific correction factor and thus, fewer resources are expended before ELISA can be used. This observation is confirmed by determining that only two sediments are required for developing a sediment site-specific correction factor whereas the soils require seven samples.

The difference between the findings of the soil and sediment sets reaffirms that the sample matrix and other site specific characteristics can have an effect on the number of GC-HRMS samples needed to produce a site-wide correction factor. Future research would require studying

62

CHAPTER TWO the effects that specific site characteristics would have on the number of samples needed to calculate site-wide correction factors.

The ability of the site-wide congener correction factors to improve ELISA results for both the soil and the sediment samples from the MOE site is examined in Section 3

2.2.

The Sample Algorithm

2.2.1. Sample algorithm development Contaminated soils can have a wide range of possible dioxin concentrations and it is important for ELISA to be able to screen across this entire range. Ideally, ELISA should be able to screen at low, medium and high levels of about 50, 1000 and 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1, respectively. The reason for these three screening levels is that they are relevant to North American dioxin testing, as described in Table 22 on the following page.

63

CHAPTER TWO

Country

Soil Criteria 1

Comments
These criteria are developed by the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

Screening Level: 50 pgTEQ g- 1 United States (De Rosa et al., 1997)

Soils are initially screened at 50 pgTEQ g- · However, soils with dioxin concentrations below the Screening Level may still require further evaluation. Soils with dioxin concentrations within the Evaluation Level require site specific investigations into bioavailability, exposure pathways and surrounding dioxin background levels. Soils with dioxin concentrations above the Actionable Level require a response action to address the contamination. Soil concentrations above this value must undergo some form of Ontario Site Specific Risk Assessment Level II remediation. This can include engineering solutions or the blocking of exposure pathways. This value is an absolute maximum and soils with concentrations below this value should still be examined for remediation options.

Evaluation Level: Between 50 and 1000 pgTEQ g-1

Actionable Level: 1000 pgTEQ g- 1

Ontario, Canada (OMOE, 1996)

Upper Concentration Limit for Soil: 1O,OOOpgTEQ g- 1

Footnote: TEQ values are calculated using the NATO toxic equivalency factors.

One challenge to using any analytical method for measuring a wide range of concentrations is that often the method has a limited dynamic range of dose-response. ELISA is no exception. For example, if a soil sample with a low dioxin concentration, such as 50 pgTEQ g- 1, was processed by an ELISA designed for screening at levels nearing 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1, the ELISA results would not be accurate. Similarly, analyzing a sample with a high concentration woultl not yield accurate results if screened at 50 pgTEQ g- 1· This dilemma was resolved by the

64

CHAPTER TWO development of a sample algorithm. This algorithm ensures an efficient introduction of a

sufficient amount of dioxin into an ELISA tube from a soil sample with unknown dioxin concentration.

The algorithm must meet four key requirements in order to be effective. The four requirements are: 1) 2) 3) Enable ELISA to screen between 50 and 10,000 pgTEQ

t 1;

Introduce between 5 and 35 pgTEQ of dioxin into an ELISA tube; Introduce a minimal but constant aliquot of sample in methanol into the ELISA tube and

4)

Prepare a sufficient sample volume to be able to run ELISA in duplicate or triplicate.

These requirements can be met by altering how the sample is prepared and subsequently introduced into the ELISA tube. Between 5 and 35 pg of dioxin must always be introduced into an ELISA tube since the ELISA analysis is most sensitive at quantities of 20±15 pgTEQ per tube (Cape Technologies, 2003b ). The amount of methanol being introduced into the ELISA tube must be minimized since methanol has been found to denature the antibodies (Zhang, 2008). While this is true, methanol is used since dioxin must be dissolved in an organic solvent that is miscible with the aqueous buffer (Zhang, 2008). For the purposes of reproducibility and

contingency, the sample volume to be prepared for ELISA should be sufficient for duplicate or triplicate runs. Three ELISA tests have been designed (Table 23) in order to meet all four of these requirements- tests whose midpoints are centered around 6000,900 and 120 pgTEQ g- 1·

65

CHAPTER TWO
Table 23. Algorithm test level ranges in pgTEQ g- 1

Test level (the midpoint) 6,000 900 120

Maximum detection level 10,500 1,500 225

Minimum detection level 1,500 225 30

Although three ELISA tests have been designed to cover between 30 and 10,500 pgTEQ g- 1, in reality only two of these tests are required for any given sample. The 900 pgTEQ g- 1 test will always be run first. If the sample dioxin concentration falls within range, the analysis is

complete. If the sample proves to have a dioxin concentration above the range of the 900 pgTEQ g- test, the 6,000 pgTEQ g- 1 test would be run next. If the dioxin concentration is below the range of the 900 pgTEQ g- 1 test, the 120 pgTEQ g- 1 test would follow. The algorithm and how it directs subsequent sample preparation is illustrated in Figure 11.

The ability of the sample algorithm to effectively screen samples into their correct test level is validated in Section 3.

2.2.2. Cost analysis of using the sample algorithm
With the concept of the sample algorithm in place, it is no longer correct to state that each sample will require only one ELISA analysis. As such, when comparing the costs of ELISA and GC-HRMS, the possibility of having to run more than one ELISA for each sample must be considered. To estimate the total cost of running samples with ELISA, a cost analysis was

67

CHAPTER TWO performed on 36 soil samples provided by the MOE with an additional four samples. The reason for including the four extra samples was to have four equal ELISA runs of ten samples each. These 40 samples, listed in Table 24, have concentrations that fall into all three test levels of the algorithm.

This estimate compares favourably to a previously reported estimate of $300 per sample (Chen, 2008).

Four labs (Maxxam Analytics Inc., Wellington Laboratories Inc., AGAT Laboratories and ALS Laboratory Group) were contacted to obtain information on their costs of running GC-HRMS dioxin analysis for soil samples. They gave an average price of $800 per sample with an average turnaround time of 45 days for 40 samples. Therefore, in comparison, running ELISA with the algorithm in place generates soil sample results three times faster and 60% less expensive.

2.3.

The Background Contamination Correction Method

The third and final improvement to ELISA is a method that accurately accounts for possible sources of dioxin that come into contact with our sample during sample preparation and ELISA analysis. Background dioxin contamination that is introduced into an ELISA tube will originate from glassware and reagents that are used throughout the entire ELISA procedure. Glassware may contain trace amounts of dioxin even after the cleaning procedures described by Zhang 2008 are followed and even the purest reagents may contain dioxin contamination at the picogram level. As such, the reagents and cleaned glassware must be tested for their background dioxin

71

CHAPTER TWO levels and the background levels of the materials used during sample preparation must be subtracted from the results given by ELISA. To do so, each piece of glassware and reagent that is used in an ELISA run is first tested with ELISA for its background dioxin level.

Since background levels are reported on a per unit basis (for example 'x' picograms per tube or 'y' picograms per mL) and different solution volumes are being transferred during different points of the procedure, it becomes a question of determining how to correctly address the amount of background dioxin that actually enters an ELISA tube. Table 28 on the following page identifies each source of background contamination and how to calculate what amount of contamination gets passed onto the next step. The step-by-step procedure for running a soil ELISA and the listed step numbers that are referred to in Table 28 are provided in Appendix B. The background levels provided in Table 28 represent typical values. An empirical assumption was made that the entire amount of dioxin that was measured for a piece of glassware enters the total amount of organic solvent that comes in contact with that glassware.

3.1.

Sample Description

Thirty-six soil samples and twenty-eight sediment samples were provided by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment from a site contaminated by an unknown dioxin source. The

samples had dioxin concentrations ranging from 11 to 27,000 pgTEQ g- 1· These concentrations were determined by GC-HRMS analysis by laboratories at the MOE. A certified reference

material (CRM) sample was also provided by the MOE. The CRM sample was used to prove that ELISA is able to report an accurate estimate of dioxin concentration in a sample without prior knowledge of the GC-HRMS determined dioxin concentration. It was also used to examine the effects of spatial variability of dioxin within a container of sample. The soil and sediment samples were used to test the ability of our lab to correlate ELISA to GC-HRMS results, then to test the ability of ELISA to function as a screen at 50, 1000 and 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1· Next, the benefits of applying congener correction factors were examined followed by a test of the sample algorithm.

Sample preparation and analysis were modified from the methodology provided by Cape Technologies (Cape-tech, 2002) as described in Zhang, 2008. A detailed standard operating

procedure, including a list of equipment, materials and chemicals needed for sample preparation,

CHAPTER THREE extraction, oxidation and evaporation is provided as Appendix B. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 offer a brief outline of the sample preparation and ELISA steps.

3.2.

Sample Preparation

Each soil and sediment sample was homogeneously mixed using a scoopula and a 5 g portion containing particles visibly smaller than approximately 2 mm was weighed out. The 5 g portion was dried with 4 g anhydrous sodium sulphate and the dioxin was extracted on a rugged rotator for 2 hours into 15 mL dimethylformamide (DMF). Approximately 10 g of CRM material (ID# PB2) were available (from the MOE Quality and Reference Section) from which eight replicates were prepared. The first contained 2 g of soil and was extracted into 6 mL DMF; the last seven contained 1 g of soil and were extracted into 3 mL DMF. CRM replicates only contained 1 or 2 g in order to maximize usage of the CRM supply. After extraction of soils, sediments and CRM, an aliquot of each sample in DMF (either 200 JlL or 1 mL, depending on the test level being run) was then solvent-exchanged into 6 mL hexane. The remaining amount of sample in DMF was stored for further experiments. The solution of DMF and hexane was oxidised on a rugged rotator for 15 minutes using 10 times the aliquot amount of fuming sulphuric acid ( 15o/o sulphur trioxide in concentrated sulphuric acid). The solvent mixture was centrifuged for five minutes at 2000xg in order to achieve a good phase separation. The hexane supernatant was transferred into an evaporation tube containing 150 f.lL keeper (80:20 methanol:polyethylene glycol [PEG] + 100 ppm Triton X-1 00). The hexane was completely evaporated at 55°C. The remaining keeper residue was reconstituted in either 70 or 120 JlL methanol, depending on the test level being run. Cape Technologies recommends additional cleanup for samples that exhibit cloudiness during

reconstitution (Cape-tech, 2002). Since no cloudiness was seen, samples were tested without any further cleanup.

The ELISA tubes and all ELISA reagents were purchased from Cape Technologies. optimised ELISA procedure is described fully in Zhang, 2008 but is summarized here.

ELISA analyses were performed by Wei Zhang, who has been responsible for ELISA analysis in previous fish studies, in order to minimise variability in results due to switches in the operator. Ten samples were tested alongside two negative controls and eight standards. Standards were also prepared by Wei Zhang. An aliquot of the sample in methanol (either 50 with 45

liquid was discarded and the tube was washed with 1 mL of Wash Solution 1, which is provided in the Cape Technologies kit. Once the wash is discarded, 500

of competitor-horseradish

peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was added in order to bind to the remaining free antibodies in the tube. After incubation in the dark, the liquid in the tubes was discarded and the tube was

washed again four times using deionized distilled water (DDW). Five hundred microlitres of a HRP substrate solution was added into the ELISA tube. A blue colour then begins to develop. This solution was allowed to react in the dark after which 500

The final raw ELISA result given in equivalents of 2,3,7,8-TCDD was obtained by converting the absorbance reading through use of a standard curve based on a four parameter equation described in Section 1.4.2.

CHAPTER THREE 3.4.

Results

Soil Samples
From the 36 soil samples provided by the MOE, 10 were run in duplicate to make a total of 46 soil samples. Of these 46 samples, 7 were lost during sample preparation and 12 samples fell out of the optimal sensitivity range of the ELISA: between 5 and 35 pgTEQ per ELISA tube. When these 46 soil samples were analyzed, the sample algorithm had not yet been developed so the 12 samples that fell out of range were not re-run in their correct range; their results were omitted. The remaining 27 samples consisted of 7 samples run in duplicate and 13 unique samples. These samples were used to examine: ( 1) the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS, (2) the effects of using a correction factor and (3) the ability of ELISA to screen at 50, 1000 and 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1·

Sediment Samples
Twenty-one of the twenty-eight sediment samples provided valid results. The other seven

sediments were not used since they provided inaccurate recoveries (1 %, 16%, 22%, 27%, 29%, 31% and 1087%). Deletion of these experimental outliers was based on the following two

rationales. Firstly, while samples should not be excluded solely on the basis of low recovery, the six samples with low recoveries mentioned here were all from the same experiment. This

particular experiment used HRP conjugate that was suspected of being deteriorated and so it is possible that this ELISA lacked the usual sensitivity of the other experiments. Secondly, the sample with a recovery of 1087% is an obvious outlier. A spatial variability of dioxin content within the sample container itself could be one explanation. The samples used for ELISA and

78

CHAPTER THREE GC-HRMS analyses were all taken from a larger sample container. It is possible that the dioxin content of the two sample portions were significantly different.

The 21 remaining sediment results were used to study: (1) the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS, (2) the effects of the correction factor, (3) the ability of ELISA to screen at 50, 1000 and 10,000 pgTEQ

i

1

and (4) the ability of the sample algorithm to place samples within the

correct ELISA testing range (120, 900 or 6,000 pgTEQ g- 1).

3.4.1. CRM sample results
The eight CRM samples were run for two purposes. The first was to establish that our laboratory team is capable of using ELISA to accurately report a sample's dioxin concentration without prior knowledge of its value. The second purpose was to verify the assumption that although each soil and sediment sample portion was taken from a larger sample container, the dioxin content is evenly distributed within the container thus producing low spatial variability. This is a rather important assumption since GC-HRMS and ELISA analyses used different sample portions collected from the same container. Any spatial variability would reduce the

comparability between the two techniques. The verification of this assumption was done by analyzing 8 separate portions of the CRM material taken from the larger sample container and comparing their predictions of dioxin content.

Figure 13 below shows the concentration of the CRM sample as determined from the eight sample portions taken from the same CRM sample container. Included is the average of the eight results and the variability, or deviation.

The average CRM dioxin concentration was determined by ELISA to be 79±19 pgTEQ g- 1 (±SD). The uncertainty, calculated as ± 1 standard deviation (Fowlie, 2003), is therefore 24%. The dioxin concentration of this CRM was previously determined by several GC-HRMS facilities as being 61±7.4 pgTEQ g- 1 (with NATO TEF values) or 62±7.7 pgTEQ g- 1 (with WH098 TEF values). The ELISA CRM result is therefore roughly 30% above this value.

However, the discrepancy can be attributed to an evaporation effect in the ELISA tube. In these experiments, the sample was reconstituted into 70 J..LL of methanol but only 50 J..LL were transferred into the ELISA tube. With such low volumes of methanol, any solvent evaporation will increase the concentration of the aliquot being transferred and thus will increase the amount of dioxin being detected by ELISA. The reason for transferring only a portion of the 70 J..LL is not straightforward and is explained in Appendix C.

An uncertainty of 24% in trace level chemistry is not unusuaL For the GC-HRMS labs that reported the dioxin values used in this thesis, uncertainty on 12 spiked soil samples over months

80

CHAPTER THREE of multiple runs was found to be between 15 and 20% (Brunato and Macpherson, 2006). Since the uncertainty is based on artificial spikes and not real soil replicates from the same sample container, it may not be indicative of the uncertainty created in comparing two soil sample portions from the same sample container. However, for the purpose of this study, it is reasonable to assume that the GC-HRMS uncertainty on the dioxin content of soil and sediment samples is 20%.

The same GC-HRMS lab also has found that uncertainty on their CRM sampling is significantly lower (Dr Eric Reiner, personal communication). CRM samples are rigorously grinded and thus more uniformly mixed than regular soil and sediment samples. It is likely that the uncertainty of the soil and sediment samples being analyzed by ELISA is higher than 24%; however this value is a reasonable assumption to apply.

The uncertainties of 20% for GC-HRMS results and 24% for ELISA results will be added as theoretical error bars in Figures 14, 15, 18, 19 and 20.

The findings of the CRM replicates indicate that our laboratory team is capable of using ELISA to accurately report dioxin concentrations without prior knowledge of their values. The findings also show that there is relatively low variability from the same sample container. results is indeed possible.

GC-HRMS (pgTEQ g-1) Figure 15. Magnification of the low-lying datapoints found in Figure 14

When the uncertainty is accounted for, the majority of data points fall within the 90% confidence interval. Significant exceptions are the three rightmost data points in Figure 15; One of these samples introduced 34 pg of dioxin into an ELISA tube. This approaches the maximum

allowable amount of 35 pg and may have led in this instance to a recovery that was slightly low. This sample could have been re-run at a higher testing level; however, it was run before the development of the sample algorithm. The other two are results from samples taken from the bottom of a harbour. These two samples will be discussed in greater detail below.

The r-squared value of the n=48 regression line is 0.994 with a slope of 0.94. This r-squared value is an improvement over what was reported by the manufacturers of the ELISA kit for a smaller set of 23 soil samples (r2=0.90, Cape-tech, 2003a). Furthermore, the sample set in this

83

CHAPTER THREE study spans a greater range of dioxin concentrations (11-27,000 pgTEQ g1 )

compared to the

span of the manufacturer's sample set (50-1000 pgTEQ g- 1). It is believed that this improvement can be attributed to the optimized ELISA procedure developed in our laboratory.

Two aerial maps were produced ustng Google Earth (earth.google.com) of the dioxin contaminated site. The first displays the soil samples and the second displays the sediments. Each map superimposes the ELISA results as blue bars, the GC-HRMS results as yellow bars and the sampling depths as red numbers. The bars are all to scale except for values that exceed 430 pgTEQ g- 1 since they would not fit into the figures. These bars have a triangle icon on their peaks. A link between sampling depth and dioxin concentration was examined but no significant relationship was found. following pages. The aerial maps can be found as Figure 16 and Figure 17 on the

The major conclusion that can be drawn from the aerial maps is that in general ELISA has the ability to map a site just as well as GC-HRMS. For the majority of the samples, areas with high concentrations can be located with either ELISA or GC-HRMS results; conversely areas of low concentrations can equally be identified. However, ELISA does underestimate the TEQ of some samples. For two of these samples (the two leftmost points in Figure 17 with low

underestimates) the fact that they were collected from deep water in the middle of the harbour may have influenced the ELISA result. Sediments at the bottom of the harbour may have other contaminants that affect the ability of ELISA to function properly. These samples may have benefitted from a sample cleanup step before analysis whereas samples collected in shallow water or on land did not seem to require cleanup.

84

CHAPTER THREE

When considering the other samples where ELISA underestimated TEQ values, it should be reemphasized that ELISA is intended only as a screening tool. Some of the samples whose

dioxin levels have been underestimated by ELISA in fact fall within the same screening level (either below 50pgTEQ g- 1, between 50 and 1,000 pgTEQ g- 1 or above 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1) whether screened by ELISA or GC-HRMS. If this is the case then ELISA has been successful in its capacity as a screening tool despite dioxin underestimation. The overall ability of ELISA to act as a screening tool at the three screening levels will be discussed next.

3.4.3. Evaluating ELISA as a screening tool
Screening at 10,000 pgTEQ g-1

Four soil samples had dioxin values that approached 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1 and thus were used to assess ELISA as a screening tool at the 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1 decision level. No sediments had dioxin concentrations that approached this screening level. A strong correlation was shown (Figure 18) between congener corrected ELISA results and NATO-based GC-HRMS results (n=4, r2=0.990, slope=0.92).

Screening at 1,000 pgTEQ g- 1 produced no false positives and 2 false negatives. One point is considered a borderline false positive and another is considered a borderline false negative. A borderline false positive/negative is a false positive/negative sample with an uncertainty that crosses either of the screening lines. Since their uncertainties overlap a screening line, they will not be considered true false positives/negatives. The false negative rate at this screening level is therefore 11% and the false positive rate is 0%. Despite the false negative result for these two

89

CHAPTER THREE samples, ELISA still predicts them to have dioxin levels significantly higher than background. In practice, ELISA has still successfully flagged those soils as warranting further analysis by GC-HRMS.

Screening at 50 pgTEQ g- 1 Five sediment and eighteen soil samples were used to assess the ability of ELISA to screen at 50 pgTEQ

t 1·

The correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS was much weaker at the 50 pgTEQ

g- 1 decision level - likely because 50 pgTEQ g- 1 begins to approach the detection limit for ELISA. However, this is the lowest threshold for dioxin screening, so it is more important to note the rate of false negatives. Of the 23 samples in the range of 50 pgTEQ g- 1, one sample run in duplicate (circled on Figure 20) produced false negatives and there were no false positives. Three samples are considered borderline false positives and four samples are considered borderline false negatives but their uncertainties overlap the 50 pgTEQ g- 1 screening lines (dotted circles on Figure 20).

GC-HRMS (pgTEQ g- 1)
Figure 20. Correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS determined dioxin concentrations for samples near the 50 pgTEQ g- 1 screening level

The false negative rate at this screening level is 9% and the false positive rate is 0%. The false negative result for the one duplicate sample is somewhat inconsequential since the dioxin concentration of the sample as determined by GC-HRMS is low (67 pgTEQ g- 1) and likely not dissimilar enough from its ELISA values (26 and 36 pgTEQ g- 1) to affect any decision about the possible health impacts of being exposed to this soil.

3.4.4. The benefits of the congener correction factor
By comparing the correlation between GC-HRMS TEQ values and ELISA results with and without application of the correction factor, it can be determined if the correction factor can successfully account for the differences between TEF and cross reactivity results and improve

91

CHAPTER THREE the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS. This companson was done for soils and

sediments by looking at the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS results calculated with both NATO and WH098 TEF values. The WH098 TEF values were used instead of the

WH005 values since the GC-HRMS results were reported using the 1998 values.

Since congener profiles were available for each sample, the effects of applying sample-specific congener correction factors were examined in addition to examining the effects of applying sitewide correction factors. The soil and sediment site-wide correction factors used average

congener profiles calculated with seven soil samples and two sediment samples, respectively. Recall from Section 2.1 that seven soils and two sediments were required to produce correction factors that are 95% of the time within 5% of the best estimate of the actual soil and sediment site-wide correction factors. Microsoft Excel was used to randomly select seven soil samples and two sediment samples. Their resulting correction factors are found in Table 29.

When the sample-specific congener correction factors were applied, a minor decrease in the agreement between ELISA and GC-HRMS values calculated with NATO TEF was observed. However, the agreement between ELISA and GC-HRMS values calculated using WH098 TEF improved by 11 o/o (Table 30). Applying the site-wide correction factors gave similar results

92

CHAPTER THREE however it decreased the agreement between ELISA and GC-HRMS values calculated with NATO TEF slightly more and improved the agreement between ELISA and GC-HRMS values calculated with WH098 TEF slightly less.

Applying site-specific soil and sediment correction factors Slope= 0.89 2 R = 0.991 Slope= 0.92 2 R = 0.991

Footnote: While the soil and the sediment samples both had their individual correction factors, their results were combined to examine the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS. These results seem to confirm that each sample would benefit from being corrected using its unique congener profile but site-wide correction factors are still capable of adequately accounting for the differences in how ELISA and GC-HRMS calculate TEQ values.

The findings of these results are two-fold. Firstly, it appears that congener corrected ELISA results have the same correlation to GC-HRMS TEQ values regardless of whether GC-HRMS uses WHO or NATO TEF values- in this case it is a correlation of 94%. An uncorrected ELISA will always correlate differently to GC-HRMS values depending on which TEF scheme GCHRMS used to calculate TEQ. This implies that with the correction factor it no longer becomes necessary to state which TEF scheme you are comparing ELISA results to. Secondly, applying congener correction factors to ELISA results has the potential of improving the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS even when the factors are close to unity. In future work, it

93

CHAPTER THREE would be valuable to confirm the beneficial effect of the correction factor for a site that produces a correction factor with a value that deviates significantly from unity.

3.4.5. Using the sample algorithm
Twenty-eight sediment samples were analyzed using the sample algorithm to determine how well it can place samples into their correct testing range. All samples were first run at the 900 pgTEQ g- testing level then, if necessary, were run a second time at either the 120 or the 6,000 pgTEQ g-1 level. Recall that a sample is considered to be within the correct range of the testing level being run when between 5 and 3 5pg are measured per ELISA tube. If less than 5pg are measured during the 120 pgTEQ g- 1 test then the results are reported as "below 30 pgTEQ g- 1". Conversely, if greater than 35pg are recorded during the 6,000 pgTEQ g- 1 test then the results are reported as "above 10,500 pgTEQ g- 1". The results, shown in Table 31 on the following page, indicate that of the 28 sediment samples, 24 were placed within their correct test range and 4 were not. This gives the sample algorithm an accuracy of 86%. Of the four incorrectly placed samples, Sed07 (which is the sample that had a recovery of 1%) was predicted by both the 1st and 2nd ELISA runs to be placed within the 120 pgTEQ g-1 testing level. This implies perhaps that ELISA did not incorrectly underestimate the dioxin content of this sample but that the sample indeed had low levels of dioxin.

APPLICATION OF ELISA AS A SCREENING TOOL

Since the optimizations suggested in the previous sections have been shown to improve the accuracy and efficiency of an ELISA for dioxins in soil, the remaining task is to identify existing and future dioxin contaminated sites where ELISA can be applied. To do so, contaminated sites that currently exist within Canada are identified and the likelihood of an emergence of future dioxin contaminated sites in Canada is discussed ..

4.1.

New or Future Contaminated Sites in Canada

Dioxins are largely created and released as combustion by-products or industrial effluents. New contaminated sites would have to arise from large aerial depositions of dioxin air emissions or from industrial spills directly to soil. A spill database compiled by Ryerson University of all environmental spills in Ontario to land, air and water between 1987 and 2007 was examined for instances where dioxin may have been released. Only two incidents were found. The first was a 100 L spill into the St. Clair River of effluent with traces of dioxin at a concentration of only 0.2 parts per quadrillion. The second was a spill in 2005 of dioxin impacted groundwater into

Snyder Creek in Waterloo that was considered to have only a potential of contaminating surface water. Both of these releases are into water and at low concentrations. As such, an ELISA for soil could not be used.

The National Pollution Release Inventory (NPRI) was also examined for instances across Canada where dioxin may have been released, disposed of or spilled into the air, water and soil since 2000- the first year that dioxins where reported. No large releases were reported and the largest '

96

CHAPTER FOUR emitters still only released trace quantities of dioxin very gradually throughout the course of a particular year.

The lack of spills in Ontario over the past 20 years and in the NPRI database is consistent with the findings of Environment Canada's Risk Evaluation Determining Whether Environmental Emergency (E2) Planning is Required Under the Environmental Emergency Regulations set under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (Environment Canada, 2006). Dioxins are considered under section 199 of CEP A, 1999 and as such, it must be determined if they require an E2 plan. Environment Canada concludes that while dioxin is considered toxic under CEPA, 1999, no industries are known to distribute, store or use the chemical. Dioxins are produced only in trace amounts and do not have a realistic emergency pathway for large scale release. Since no spills are actually anticipated in Canada, Environment Canada does not require an E2 plan for dioxins.

The findings of the spill database and NPRI reporting and the lack of a dioxin E2 plan indicates that the occurrence of future dioxin contaminated sites in Canada is unlikely. An ELISA for dioxins in soil would be best used at existing Canadian dioxin contaminated sites.

4.2.

Existing Contaminated Sites

Within Canada, ELISA would be very beneficial in screening for dioxins in many of the federal sites that have dioxin contaminated soils. The Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory (FCSI, 2005) lists all of the federally controlled contaminated sites across Canada. It includes details such as the types of contaminants, the volume of contaminated material and most importantly, the current status of the site. The current status of the site is important since it indicates which

97

CHAPTER FOUR sites would benefit from ELISA and which sites are not at a stage where ELISA could be used. Table 32 below lists the Federal contaminated 10-step process and in which of those steps ELISA could be used.

Currently, 3 7 sites exist where ELISA could be of some benefit. The remaining 97 sites, while not currently at a stage where ELISA could be of use, will at some point reach one of these stages. One caveat to using ELISA would be that some sites with contaminants such as

hydrocarbons or large quantities of PCBs may have to be omitted since these contaminants could potentially interfere with the ELISA process. Nevertheless, matrix interference by PCBs and other hydrocarbons could be eliminated by sample cleanup before ELISA. Upon examination of , the list of sites (which is too extensive to include in this thesis), it seems that for many, ELISA could prove to be an important asset to the remediation process. ELISA can increase the total

98

CHAPTER FOUR quantity of samples from a site, improve the mapping of contaminated areas, help re-evaluate the remediation strategy and decrease the cost of future site monitoring.

In addition to the 114 federally-controlled contaminated sites, many privately owned sites could also benefit from an ELISA for dioxins in soil. The major obstacle in dioxin testing of privately owned sites is that often the land owners would prefer not knowing if their property has dioxin contamination. A conversation in Fall 2007 with Dr. Jagani, president of AiMS Environmental revealed that dioxin testing at a site is only required when dioxin contamination is suspected. Therefore, it is unlikely that a land owner will voluntarily determine if the site has dioxin contaminated soil since this would introduce additional remediation costs. While this may be the case for privately owned lands, discussions with four analytical labs (summarized in Table 33) indicate that GC-HRMS testing for dioxins in soil is still frequently performed.

Comments given towards the frequency of dioxin analy_sis. They run dioxin soil testing everyday. Testing for dioxins in soils is frequent. They run dioxin samples all the time. Busy but testing frequency is declining.

Dioxin testing through GC-HRMS is still frequently done. Therefore, developing ELISA as a screening tool can indeed prove to be beneficial as the market for dioxin testing is still strong.

CONCLUSIONS

The findings of this thesis have confirmed that ELISA is fully capable of functioning as a screening tool for dioxin contaminated soils and sediments. When the congener correction factor is applied, the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS was strong (n=48, r =0.994, slope=0.94). Inspection of two aerial maps has shown that ELISA has successfully identified areas of high and low dioxin concentrations from a site with contaminated soils and sediments. Finally, ELISA produced no false positives and low false negative rates of 0%, 11% and 9% for the three screening levels important to North American dioxin testing - 10,000 pgTEQ g- 1, 1,000 pgTEQ g- 1 and 50 pgTEQ g- 1· To add to these successes, a costing analysis of ELISA has shown that it can produce results three times faster than GC-HRMS and concomitantly, a 60o/o reduction in operating cost with the sample algorithm in place.

The congener correction factor resolves the discrepancy between how ELISA and GC-HRMS report dioxin concentrations to a degree that has not been previously published. This

discrepancy has previously been addressed to some extent by either using an ELISA equivalent of TEQ (ELISA-EQ) when reporting values or by correcting site-specific datasets using empirical methods. Both of these methods are irrelevant to any practical use of ELISA as a screening tool for dioxins in soil. The concept of ELISA-EQ is not acceptable since it does nothing to account for the differences between GC-HRMS TEQ and ELISA results. ELISA would remain a technology that can only roughly approximate dioxin concentrations and thus fails to provide results that can be compared to policies and environmental guidelines, which always utilize GC-HRMS derived TEQ values. The use of empirical methods quoted in other

100

CHAPTER FIVE research (Nording et al., 2007) to correct ELISA results is unrealistic. The empirical correction factor involves applying the inverse slope of the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS to subsequent ELISA samples from that site. To produce an empirical factor, a restrictively large number of samples need to be analyzed by GC-HRMS. Without a large number of samples, an accurate determination of the correlation between ELISA and GC-HRMS (and hence an accurate empirical correction factor) could not be established. In sharp contrast, the correction factor developed in this study site requires only seven GC-HRMS determination for soil samples and only two GC-HRMS determinations for sediment samples. Furthermore, since the correction factor is essentially a method to calibrate ELISA results to GC-HRMS TEQ, it is constrained by the restrictions placed on calibration curves. That is, the calibration value is only valid for the range that was used to generate it. Therefore, the samples used to generate the empirical factor must cover the anticipated range of dioxin concentration values for that particular site. If a sample was analyzed by subsequent ELISA and found to be above the concentration range used to generate the empirical factor, the factor could not be used. This is again in sharp contrast to the correction factor developed in this work as it can be applied to ELISA results for any sample taken from a site, regardless of the sample's concentration. As a result of the flaws of empirical correction factors, useful, accurate ones would be very difficult to generate. They would depend on a great. deal of initial GC-HRMS sampling, would potentially require additional GC-HRMS analysis during the course of ELISA site surveying and thus would command unacceptably large investments of time, money and resources,

Unlike the empirical approach, the congener correction factor proposed in this work is mathematically derived from first principles of how ELISA and GC-HRMS convert dioxin

101

CHAPTER FIVE concentrations into 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents. Therefore, it circumvents the problems inherent in ELISA-EQ and empirical correction factors thereby rendering them obsolete. In practice, the congener correction factor is the only viable method of correcting samples in real situations. In addition to being practical in ELISA site surveying, the correction factor is fully capable of accounting for the likelihood that ELISA will either incorrectly over- or under-report dioxin releases from many different dioxin emitting sources including smelters, incinerators and other combustion processes.

When ELISA results were corrected using sample-specific correction factors and were correlated to GC-HRMS TEQ, it seems that they correlated equally well to GC-HRMS regardless of which TEF scheme (WHO or NATO) GC-HRMS used. The impact of this finding is that unlike GCHRMS, which could report in either NATO-TEQ or WHO-TEQ, a congener corrected ELISA simply reports its values and can be compared directly to both schemes. A fundamental impact is that major disagreements between NATO and WHO and between ELISA and GC-HRMS are removed.

For sites with dioxin contaminated soils, sample-specific correction factors cannot be used as they would rely on a GC-HRMS analysis for each ELISA analysis. Consequently, the use of site-specific correction factors is required for ELISA to be accurate. To generate site-specific correction factors, spearhead plots were generated for both the soil and sediment datasets. Examination of these spearhead plots determined that for this site, site-specific correction factors required averaged congener profiles of seven samples for soils and two samples for sediments. ' The use of averaged site-specific correction factors proved to have the same benefits of sample-

102

CHAPTER FIVE specific correction factors. Correlations between ELISA and WH098-derived TEQ improved by 9% to a correlation of 92% and correlations between ELISA and NATO-derived TEQ remained strong falling from a correlation of 102% to a correlation of 89%. Similar to use of samplespecific correction factors, average site-specific correction factors can improve the correlation between ELISA results and GC-HRMS TEQ regardless of which TEF scheme is used.

The sample algorithm offers a simple solution to the problem of efficiently screening soils that may have widely different dioxin concentrations. US EPA Method 4025 (US EPA, 2002) and Cape Technologies (Cape-Tech, 2003a; Cape-Tech, 2003b; Cape-Tech, 2002) offer only methods to screen at one particular screening level and do not discuss screening across a continual range of values. A test of the sample algorithm successfully placed 24 of 28 samples into their correct testing level: either at 120, 900 or 6,000 pgTEQ g- 1· One other sample was likely placed in the correct testing level however these results disagreed with the GC-HRMS prediction for the dioxin content of that sample. Since the high success rate of the sample

algorithm was accomplished in a maximum of two ELISA runs per sample, the sample algorithm improves the efficiency of ELISA as a monitoring tool for any given soil sample.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the findings of this thesis, it is recommended that the sample algorithm and congener correction factor should be employed when using ELISA as a screening tool for soils and sediments. The two new concepts mark advancements in areas that have previously impeded the practicality of ELISA- the discrepancy between the methods used by ELISA and GC-HRMS to report total dioxin concentrations of a sample and the lack of a way to efficiently screen soils across a wide range of dioxin concentrations. Adoption of these concepts has finally

transformed ELISA from a potentially useful into a fully functional screening tool. This reality was confirmed by an accurate mapping of soil and sediments at a dioxin contaminated site.

A second recommendation is that the congener correction factor be applied to other ELISA technologies. For example, the current PCB ELISA in the market suffers the same limitation of discrepancy to GC-MS. Adaptation of the congener correction factor would allow ELISA to better analyse for PCBs in soil, sediment, fish tissue and other matrices. The implication of this is that the correction factor can impact other markets beyond dioxin testing and can lead to the factor becoming a vital part of many different ELISA technologies.

It is proposed that ELISA be used as a screening tool at the 114 federally controlled sites with

dioxin contamination. With a need for a minimal amount of GC-HRMS soil analyses at each site, ELISA can fulfil the initial testing, detailed testing, confirmatory sampling and long term monitoring steps detailed in the Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory 10-step process.

104

CHAPTER6
It is further recommended that sites with dioxin contaminated sediments should be targeted first

since sediments will likely require fewer initial GC-HRMS analyses to produce a site-wide correction factor that will correct subsequent ELISA results. The implication is that

contaminated water bodies and drinking water sources can be quickly and efficiently dealt with by ELISA.

ELISA should also be used to enable the Canada-Wide Standards for Dioxins and Furans to achieve their objective of a Virtual Elimination of dioxin emissions. Despite the ambitious aim of the CWS, the program targets only five industries that emit just 56% of 1999 Canadian atmospheric emissions (CCME, 2004) and two of these industries are struggling to meet even interim reduction goals. Additionally, backyard burning (which is the largest Canadian emitter of dioxins) is completely unregulated, small facilities that fall within the five targeted industries go unmonitored and dioxin emissions from many industries that are potential dioxin emitters are completely unquantified (CCME, 2004).

The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment has expressed a desire to increase dioxin monitoring and validate new pollution prevention technologies in order improve upon the performance of the CWS. The dioxin monitoring and pollution prevention technologies would rely on GC-HRMS; however, GC-HRMS testing is at capacity and would be unable to accommodate any additional testing. Therefore, ELISA, in conjunction with the correction

factor and sample algorithm, should be used as a screening tool to offset some of the burden placed on GC-HRMS and allow it to become more available for the high-precision, highaccuracy testing that would be beneficial to the policies of the CWS.

105

CHAPTER6

Before ELISA can be used as a screening tool at federal contaminated sites, future in-house method development is required. ELISA must become an accredited method at the MOE by a certified Canadian environmental analytical laboratory auditor. This would be a key step in establishing a Canadian center of excellence in dioxin monitoring and cleanup.

Academic research is desirable to fully understand how sediment transport, dioxin source type and soil chemistry can affect the resulting correction factors. This knowledge could potentially promote use of correction factors specific to the dioxin source. The advantage of using sourcespecific correction factors is that no initial GC-HRMS testing at contaminated sites would be required before use of ELISA.

Finally, the benefits of a correction factor should be extended into use with air, water and food samples. ELISA can then become an integral component of all dioxin monitoring and testing, can contribute directly to an improvement of the Canada-Wide Standards for Dioxins and Furans, and can further mitigate the impact of dioxins on humans, wildlife and the environment.

APPENDIX A

Appendix A- Methodology for the generation of the 200 randomly ordered datasets used to create the spearhead figures.

Appendix A presents the methodology applied to generate the 200 datasets that were used to create the spearhead figure found in the main text as Figure 6. The first step in the process is to sort the percent compositions of the 2S soil samples (S 1· S2S) using a random number generator. This produces a unique order of the 2S sample dataset (Table A 1). From the order in Table AI, average percent compositions were calculated for sample sizes ofn=l,2,3 .. .,2S (Table A2). For instance, the sample order in Table A 1 indicates that the average percent composition for n=4 was calculated using the percent compositions of samples S7, S9, SlO and S2. Composite cross reactivity and TEF values (Tables A3 and A4, respectively) were then calculated by multiplying the individual cross reactivity and TEF values for each congener by its average percent composition at each sample size and summing the results. Finally, the

correction factors for each sample size were calculated by dividing the composite TEF value by the composite cross reactivity value. Table AS shows the correction factors calculated for each sample size for this particular sample order (presented in Table AS as 'Dataset Order 1'). This entire process was repeated 200 times using a Microsoft Excel macro and the resulting correction factors for five other random dataset orders are also shown in Table AS.

APPENDIX B

Appendix B- Draft of a standard operating procedure for soil and sediment samples at the MOE

This draft Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the general methodology that has been developed to prepare samples in a soil matrix using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). It has been written to describe the changes needed for soil analysis to the MOE Draft Method 3486 (Lo and Clarke, no date) and so it only includes sample weighing, extraction, oxidation and evaporation. These four steps are a modified version of the methodology

presented by Cape Technologies (Cape-Tech, 2002).

2. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

The sample weighing, extraction, oxidation and evaporation steps are written for the preparation of one soil sample at a time. However, 30 samples can be extracted and oxidized at once and 24 can be evaporated at once. Samples can be sealed with parafilm and stored in the fridge at any point in the procedure listed here. This SOP was written for soil samples that do not require clean up before ELISA analysis. consideration.
It was also written to take the sample algorithm into

3. PROCEDURE Note: as samples may contain high levels of dioxins and other contaminants, be sure to always wear gloves and a protective breathing mask and always work in a fume hood. 3.1. Sample Weighing 3.1.1. Tare a blue-capped centrifuge tube being held upright in a small 50 mL beaker on a digital scale. Use a metal scoopula to measure 4 g of anhydrous sodium

123

APPENDIXB sulphate into the tube. Record the weight. Be sure to wipe the scoopula clean before proceeding to the next step. 3.1.2. Tare a Teflon-capped glass vial being held upright in a small 50 mL beaker on a digital scale. 3.1.3. Retrieve a soil sample and using a metal scoopula, stir the sample to ensure good homogeneity. If there are any large soil chunks, use the scoopula to break them apart. 3.1.4. Weigh out 5 g of soil into the tared glass vial and record the exact weight. The sample should contain only finely broken up soil with no vegetation, large chunks, rocks or any other debris. 3.1.5. Wipe off the scoopula with a clean Kimwipe or wash if necessary.

3.2. Extraction and Oxidation

3.2.1. Empty the anhydrous sodium sulphate from the blue-capped centrifuge tube into the glass vial containing the soil sample. Stir the mixture with a metal scoopula until the sample is free flowing. 3.2.2. In a fume hood, carefully decant DMF into a clean 100 mL beaker. Pour 15 mL of DMF into an empty Teflon-capped glass vial using the Teflon-capped vial with the 15 mL marking as a guide. Caution: DMF is a hazardous substance. Wear gloves and safety glasses and proceed with care. 3.2.3. Add the DMF and six glass mixing beads into the soil mixture. 3.2.4. After ensuring that the cap is tightened, attach the vial to the rugged rotator. To keep the wheel balanced, ensure that vials are attached in pairs across the wheel from each other. 3.2.5. Select a rotation speed that allows the solid mixture inside to tumble. To allow for complete extraction, the sample should remain on the wheel for 2 hours. 3.2.6. Check periodically to make sure that the solid mixture continues to tumble inside the vial and does not start to stick to the bottom. Note: Be sure to also check that the tubes do not leak during the entire 2 hour extraction.

124

APPENDIX B 3.2. 7. Centrifuge the sample for 15 minutes at 1OOOx g to fully separate the different fractions. To keep the centrifuge balanced, ensure that vials are placed in pairs across the centrifuge from each other. 3.2.8. In a fume hood, carefully pour 6 mL hexane into a new borosilicate glass tube using the borosilicate glass tube with the 6 mL marking as a guide. Transfer this into a new Teflon-capped vial. 3.2.9. Using a positive displacement pipettor, transfer either 200J1L or 1 mL of DMF extract to a Teflon-capped vial containing 6 mL hexane. Inject the DMF below the surface of the hexane. The amount of extract to be transferred is dependant on which test level is being followed. See the algorithm in Section 2.2 of the main thesis body for details. 3.2.1 0. Using a Pasteur pipette, transfer the remaining DMF into another Teflon-capped vial for storage. Extracts are stable for one month at room temperature in a tightly sealed vial. The soil mixture can now be discarded in the proper waste container.

3.2.11. In a fume hood, carefully pour either 2 mL fuming sulphuric acid into a new borosilicate glass tube using the borosilicate glass tube with the 2 mL marking as a guide or 10 mL fuming sulphuric acid into a Teflon-capped vial using the Teflon-capped vial with the 10 mL marking as a guide. The amount of acid to be poured is dependant on which dioxin decision level test is selected. See the algorithm in Section 2.2 for details. Caution: fuming sulphuric acid is corrosive and hygroscopic. Wear gloves and safety glasses and proceed with care.
3.2.12. Using a Pasteur pipette, slowly transfer the acid into the Teflon-capped vial containing hexane and DMF extract. The acid should not be exposed in air for too long as this may lead to adsorption of water which will decrease the so3 concentration in solution and cause incomplete oxidation of the sample. 3.2.13. Tightly cap the vial and reattach the sample to the rugged rotator. To keep the wheel balanced, ensure that vials are attached in pairs across the wheel from each other. The sample should be spun for 15 minutes to allow for complete oxidation. At the end of the oxidation, the vial should be warm but not hot. 3.2.14. Centrifuge the sample at 2000xg for 5 minutes to achieve full separation of phases.

Note: At this point, the acid phase should be dark reddish brown and should have a clean separation from the hexane layer. If the DMF extract was originally dark then acid layer may also be black or dark grey. If the interface between the hexane and the acid is not sharp and shows signs of cloudiness or flocculation, oxidation was incomplete and steps 3.2.11 to 3.2.14 should be repeated.

125

APPENDIXB 3.2.15. Using a positive displacement pipettor, dispense 150 J..!L PEG-Triton Keeper solution into the bottom of a fresh borosilicate tube. 3.2.16. Using a Pasteur pipette, transfer as much of the sample's oxidized upper hexane layer as possible into the tube with the Keeper solution. Be sure not to transfer any of the lower layer as this contamination will carry through into the ELISA analysis. 3 .2.17. Cover the top of the tube in aluminum foil and wrap in parafilm. Store at room temperature until sample is to be evaporated. Typically the evaporation is performed one day before ELISA is run.
3.3. Evaporation

3.3.1. Tum on the waste air stream with tubing that leads to the white waste bucket. Leave the air running for 10 minutes to purge the system of any dust. 3.3.2. Attach a new Pasteur pipette for each sample that is to be evaporated to one of 24 hose endings coming from the drying apparatus connected to the dry bath. Make sure that all unused hose endings also have Pasteur pipettes attached as this prevents nitrogen from leaking from an open ending. 3.3 .3. After running the waste air stream for 10 minutes, close this air valve and open the adjacent valve that is connected to the Nitrovap system. Tum the lever on the Nitrovap system from 'Standby' to 'Nitrogen On'. Nitrogen should now be flowing to the drying apparatus. 3.3.4. Adjust the nitrogen flowrate to 0.1 psi using the pressure gauge next to the drying apparatus. 3.3.5. Tum on the dry bath and adjust the temperature to 55°C. 3.3.6. Place the sample tube in a dry bath slot and slip the clean Pasteur pipette connected to the hose ending through the slotted scaffolding supports so that the pipette tip is blowing nitrogen onto the top of the sample tube. 3.3. 7. Readjust the pressure again so that the nitrogen is swirling the liquid in the tube but the surface seems undisturbed. Blowing too much nitrogen will evaporate the sample too quickly and will lead to an excess loss of analyte. 3.3.8. Wrap the dry bath with a layer of tin foil to conserve the heat and protect the sample from any dust. 3.3.9. Periodically check the sample so that it can be removed as soon as it is finished evaporating. It is finished when there is only a small portion of Keeper remaining

126

APPENDIX B on the bottom of the tube and there is no detectable hexane odour from the tube. Do not overdry the sample. 3.3.10. Once the sample has evaporated, remove it from the bath, seal it with an aluminum foil cover and parafilm it closed. 3.3.11. Turn off the dry bath, close the air valve feeding into the Nitrovap system and turn the lever on the Nitrovap system from 'Nitrogen On' to 'Standby'.

The remaining ELISA procedure is essentially unchanged from what is reported in (Lo and Clarke, no date) and so it is not included here.

127

APPENDIXC Appendix C- The trade-off between ELISA accuracy and the elimination of detection gaps in the sample algorithm When a sample is being analyzed for dioxin content by ELISA, the intent of the analysis must be clarified. There are two possible intents. One intent would be to screen samples over a wide concentration range in which case absolute accuracy is not essential. The other intent would be to determine the dioxin content as accurately as possible within a narrow concentration range. This intent would be relevant for applications such as food analysis. Depending on the desired intent, different sample preparation procedures should be followed.

For the first intent, the procedure outlined in the sample algorithm should be followed. The three test levels of the algorithm (the 120, 900 and 6,000 pgTEQ g- 1 tests) are capable of measuring for dioxin concentrations that range from 30 to 10,500 pgTEQ g- 1· However, in order to do so, a certain level of accuracy within the ELISA is lost. The reason for this is as follows. The final step in the ELISA process is to reconstitute the evaporated sample into a volume of methanol and transfer sufficient methanol into the ELISA tube for analysis. The methanol and transfer

volumes for the three testing levels of the sample algorithm are shown in Table C 1.
Table C I. Reconstitution and transfer volumes for the testing levels of the sample algorithm

Sample algorithm testing level (pgTEQ g- 1) 120 900 6,000

Amount of methanol to be added to reconstitute the evaporated sample (J.tL) 70 120 70

Amount of sample in methanol to be transferred to the ELISA tube (J.tL) 50 50 5

As shown in Table C 1, the transferred amount of methanol is less than the amount of methanol needed for reconstitution. As such, any evaporation that occurs with the reconstituted methanol

128

APPENDIX C will concentrate the amount of methanol being transferred into the ELISA tube and will cause higher than expected ELISA results.

For the three test levels of the algorithm, only a portion of the methanol is being transferred to ensure that the correct amount of dioxin is entering the ELISA tube. Adding the full amount of reconstituted methanol will alter the sensitivity range of the ELISA analysis thus causing detection gaps within the sample algorithm. For instance, if the full methanol volume was

transferred for the 900 pgTEQ g- 1 test, then the ELISA would be sensitive only to dioxin values between 75 and 525 pgTEQ g-1· Since the 6,000 pgTEQ g- 1 test is sensitive between 1500 and 10,500 pgTEQ g- 1, there would be a detection gap between 525 and 1500 pgTEQ g- 1· Due to various constraining variables, no mathematical solution was found that has three testing levels covering between 30 and 10,000 pgTEQ g-1 while simultaneously introducing the full amount of reconstituted methanol. Therefore if the intent of analysis is to determine the actual dioxin content of a sample, there is a necessary trade-off between ELISA accuracy and the necessity of eliminating detection gaps within the algorithm.

For the second intent which focuses on a higher accuracy, it is not necessary to have a sample procedure that covers a wide range of dioxin concentrations. In other words, the problem of eliminating detection gaps does not exist. Therefore, sample preparation can be modified

accordingly so that the full amount of reconstituted methanol is added into the ELISA tube. The effects of methanol evaporation are eliminated and a higher level of ELISA accuracy is maintained.

APPENDIXD

Appendix D- Calculation of the n=7 congener correction factor for soil samples

Appendix D presents the calculations required to generate the WH098 and NATO n=7 site-wide soil correction factors. The first step in the process is to sort the congener percent compositions of the 25 soil samples (S1-S25) using a random number generator. This produces a unique order of the 25 sample dataset (Table D 1). The first seven samples in Table D 1 (S 11, S 14, S 17, S21, S25, S4 and S8) were used to generate an average congener profile. This profile was used to calculate correction factors using WH098 and NATO TEF values (Tables D2 and D3 respectively). As predicted, these n=7 site-wide correction factors were within 5% of the

WH098 and NATO n=25 site-wide correction factors, respectively.
