[1]     ABSTRACT 
Design, Analysis and Testing of a RadialAxial Hybrid Active Force Compliant Tool Head for Deburring  Turbine Engine Parts    A thesis of the degree of Master of Applied Science in Aerospace Engineering, 2011    By  Brian Petz    Department of Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University      In this thesis, a new concept and design is presented for a tool with the purpose of deburring gas turbine  engine parts. This new concept utilizes both axial and radial active force compliance to accomplish the  burr removal in a more robust manner. The axial and radial components are integrated in a manner that  allows them to be decoupled, reducing the complexity of the system.   The tool is designed around a pneumatic spindle that is affixed to pneumatic axial actuators. The axial  motion system is then affixed to the radial system which makes use of a 2 axis rotary gimbal, acting as a  2D pivot.  Sensors for the axial and radial components of the tool are independent of each other. Axial  sensing is accomplished using a commercial stringpotentiometer and radial sensing is accomplished  using magnets and magnetic field sensors.   Burr formation and methods of removal are discussed. Different deburring tool designs available  commercially and through literature are then explored. The design process of selecting axial and radial  actuation and sensing and integrating them together while keeping the systems decoupled is outlined.  Modeling of the tool is then developed and a simulation of the tool is presented to illustrate the  deburring mechanics of the decoupled axial and radial components. Experimentation to determine the  stiffness qualities of the tool as well as calibration of the sensors are presented and used within the  simulation.

[1]      CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION 
 

1.1 BURR FORMATION  
In order to understand deburring, it is first necessary to understand what a burr is and how a burr is  formed. Once this is understood, all measures possible within the manufacturing process can be taken in  order to reduce the size and recurrence of these burrs. This will minimize the requirements for  deburring, thereby cutting costs in production and increasing efficiency. Focus should always be given to  eliminating the problem of the burr at the source before attempting to provide a fix for the after effects.  Once these avenues have been explored, deburring methods should be examined with great care, as  many different methods exist and work well for difference scenarios.  Work on the understanding and reduction of burrs began in the 1970s. F. Shafer, K. Nakayama and M.  Arai, L.K. Gillespie and P.T. Blotter (Gillespie, 1999) were the pioneers of burr research, modelling and  theory. They set the foundation for a growing body of research aimed at understanding, reducing and  removing burrs from work pieces. These researchers categorized burrs according to their geometries  (Schäfer, 1978), cause of formation (Gillespie, 1996) and cutting edges involved and directions of  formation (Nakayama, 1987).    Burrs are generally features of a work piece that lie outside the desired boundaries of the part, set by its  geometry, i.e. the rough and jagged edges left after a piece has been cut. Burrs are an unavoidable  consequence of the loss of support at the edges of a work piece in material removal operations.  Unfortunately, after this introductory statement, the problem gets increasingly complex.  An  understanding of what burrs are and how they are formed must be understood before their remedy can  be considered.  1.1.1 Burr Geometry 

Looking at burr geometry is useful in understanding its formation. Figure 11 contains a typical burr. Its  generation can be the product of a variety of different machining operations. There are four main  characteristics of a burr. The burr height dictates the overall length of the burr. The burr root thickness  is the measure of the depth within the part that the deformation penetrates, perpendicular to the face  opposing the cutting plane. The burr thickness is a measure of the thickness of the burr and the burr  radius is the radius of the curve that the burr forms with the face opposing the cutting plane.   1   

 
Figure 11 ­ Burr Geometries (Min, 2004) 

  The values of these geometries are dependent upon many things in the cutting process including the  material strengths, shapes of the contacting components, the cutting speeds, feeds and cutter  parameters. The size of the burr is proportional to the cutting edge radius and the applied pressure.   1.1.2 Burr Formation Mechanisms 

Burrs can be formed in many different ways from different cutting operations. There are four main burr  types that will be explored next.   Poisson Burrs  Poisson Burrs, as shown in Figure 12 are formed from the deformation of material during cutting. The  material is deformed in a lateral direction forming extensions along the cutting plane and making it  impossible for the cutter to remove these pieces.    

2   

 
Figure 12  Poisson Burr Formation during turning (Gillespie, 1999) 

  Entrance Burrs  Entrance burrs, as shown in Figure 13 are burrs formed by plastic deformation as a tool enters a work  piece. This is due to the material that the tool initially displaces as it enters the work piece before  shearing has fully initiated.  Strain hardening plays an important role in the formation of both Poisson  burrs and Entrance burrs.   

 
Figure 13  Entrance Burrs forming during a cutting operation (Gillespie, 1999) 

3   

Rollover/ Exit Burrs  Rollover burrs are generated when a cutting tool is exiting a piece and it is easier for the piece to bend  and deform than it is to cut or fracture the edge. This ease of deformation occurs because at the edge of  the work piece, no more material is available to provide the resistant shear force that facilitates the  removal of material through the rest of the cut. Rollover burrs are very common and are the burr  modelled in Figure 11  Tear Burrs  Tear burrs, as shown in Figure 14 occur when chips are torn from the work piece instead of sheared off  in the proper manner. Tear burrs are smaller than other burrs and generally resemble small jagged  edges where the material separated according to its grain structure instead of the cutting tool. Tear  burrs are common in the stamping process as well as when side milling a part.  

 
Figure 14  Tear burrs caused by a chip torn from the part (Gillespie, 1999) 

  Other Unwanted Edge Projections  Unwanted edge projections are those that occur not from the cutting process. These can include recast  material, cutoff projections, flash, cratered edging, nicks, dings, scratches and other accidental damage.  Recast material is formed when molten metal from cutting, electrical discharge machining or some  other process gathers on a work surface or edge. Cutoff projections are the protrusions formed when a  piece of bar stock is cut, typically with a band saw or on the lathe. Flash is created when casting a  material. Excess material gathers in the seam created by the two separate parts of the mould. If proper  pressure and alignment exists, this can be minimized or eliminated. Cratered edges occur when the  4   

piece being machined is brittle and breaks easily. A cratered edge is essentially the opposite of a burr.  Excess material is inadvertently removed. Although the part does not exceed the geometric tolerances,  the surface will still have to be smoothed out according to specification (in most cases, if the material  removed is greater than the allowable minimum tolerance, the part will have to be scrapped or weld  repaired). Dings, scratches or other accidental damage must be dealt with on a case by case basis. Some  damage, like a scratch, can be buffed or polished out. An excellent illustration of burr formation can be  seen in Figure 15, showing the progression of the burr formation as the cutter passes through the edge  of the work piece.

1.2 DEFINING THE PROBLEM 
Once efforts to mitigate burr formation have been attempted, it is time to address the issue of burr  removal. It is not possible to completely eliminate burr formation and even if this was possible, many  parts require a finishing edge chamfer for safety and ease of assembly. Deburring and edge finishing are  unavoidable processes.   When deburring is done by manual operators, there is no need to fully understand and define the  difficulties encountered when removing burrs and smoothing edges because by nature, humans are  highly adaptable to the variety of complex geometries that are encountered. A systematic way to  approach the problem is difficult because of the variation in methods from operator to operator.   In the case of automation, a systematic approach is required. Automation relies heavily on  measurement and consistency. Consequently it is necessary to quantify the difficulties encountered in  deburring and edge finishing. Issues of why a feature is difficult to deburr and what characteristics cause  this difficulty are very important to developing an automated process to produce results that are more  consistent than manual processes. These processes must also overcome the shortcomings of  automation such as a lack of adaptability.   Eight criteria have recently been established that effectively describe the difficulties encountered in burr  removal (Petz, 2010). These criteria are as follows; the size of the feature to be deburred, the tolerance  applied to that feature, its proximity to other features, its complexity and machinability of the material,  accessibility of the feature, confinement of the feature and the severity of the burr on the feature edge.   In designing a tool to automate precision deburring, it is wise to consider these criteria. If a tool can be  developed that addresses all of the criteria that cause a burr to be difficult to remove, that tool will be  very useful in automating the process, decreasing process time, increasing accuracy and ultimately  saving industry money.  Even if a tool may only be able to address a few or even one of these problems,  significant savings can still be made.   This thesis addresses issues that pertain to the deburring of turbine discs for turbine engines. Turbine  disc, like the one illustrated in Figure 16 are employed in the hot section of the engine and are where  the turbine blades that harness the forces of the hot expanding gasses to drive the engine are mounted.  The incredible heat from the combustion of jet fuel coupled with the centripetal forces imparted on the  disc from the high rotational speeds create an environment high in stress, temperature, corrosion and 

6   

fatigue.  Turbine discs are subject to some of the most inhospitable environments known to engineering.  Because of this, the materials used are incredibly tough and difficult to form, the geometries must be  complex and the tolerances are among the highest applied in any macro scaled machining industry.   Materials used in manufacturing turbine discs are nickel super alloys like Waspaloy and Inconel.  

 
Figure 16  CAD Rendering of a High Pressure Section Turbine Disc 

  Adding to the imperative of this issue is that deburring is, after all, a parts finishing process. This implies  that the part has passed through all other stages of manufacturing. The part has come as a cast ingot,  has passed through all of the lathe and mill work, the honing and broaching, any chemical treatments  and all quality inspections after each process. All of these processes are automated to the utmost  degree of accuracy, repeatability and quality. By the time the disc reaches the deburring department,  the value of the part exceeds that of an entire automobile. At this stage a human operator deburrs the  part manually with a file and a pneumatic rotary tool.  Currently, tremendous resources are expended in the manual deburring of turbine discs and other  turbine engine components. The total cost of deburring and parts finishing can be 1020% of the total  cost of the part (Tomastik, 1997). Highly skilled technicians meticulously scrape and sand every edge in  order to chamfer and smooth them to an acceptable edge profile using tools resembling dentistry  equipment and jeweler tooling.  This process is time consuming, holds environmental health and safety  issues and is prone to human error. Training new technicians is costly and takes months. The limited  number of skilled technicians causes capacity shortages and bottlenecks in the production line. 

7   

There are many solutions to the problem of burr removal on turbine discs. These include design  alterations to mitigate the creation of burrs, specialized manual tooling available to operators and  automated processes both of a mass finishing and a localized nature that can either replace or more  likely compliment the manual deburring component.  The nature of burr formation is one that is inconsistent and varies greatly between parts. Variables like  material microstructure, resonant  frequencies / chatter and tool wear all play factors in the size and  shape of burrs that are formed when cutting materials. Burrs can be similar but no two burrs are the  same and this causes great problems when attempting to automate the deburring process. By nature,  automation is repeatable and consistent and is therefore juxtaposed to the problem of burr removal.  The challenge in automating a process of this nature is to add robustness to the automation i.e. to  create an automated process that is not only repeatable and consistent but also adaptable to varying  geometries in order to produce an acceptable edge. The challenge is illustrated in the diagram in Figure  17.

1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The perceived solution to the problem of automating the deburring process lies in Active Force  Compliance (AFC). A system applies AFC by taking a measurement of current conditions and adjusting  the cutting force applied to the edge based on that measurement. A human operator uses their sense of  touch and sight to position the cutting tool in the appropriate position and then applies a cutting force  to the work piece. The operator can then sense the force that they are applying as well as the  displacement that the tool incurs due to the burr. The operator varies the applied force based on what  has been sensed in what is in essence, an AFC system.  In creating a robust automation process,  specialized tooling must be developed that will allow the system to mimic the senses of the operator  that allow the operator to perform so robustly while still maintaining the level of control that makes an  automated process effective.  As mentioned above, there are effectively two manners in which the  operator collects feedback information about the cutting conditions. The operator uses the resistance  encountered in the muscles in their hand and arm to feel the cutting force they are applying to the work  piece and those same muscles are used to sense the relative displacement of the tool. The information  is obviously not quantified but is used intuitively by the operator to adjust the level of force they apply  and produce an acceptable edge profile.   The operator employs both a force measurement and a displacement measurement method in order to  affect the desired tool control. Currently, various 6axis force measuring devices exist that can and are  being implemented for advances in deburring technology. However, there is no device available that  measures the minute displacements caused by the burr and adjusts the cutting forces according to  those measurements. In light of this, the purpose of this thesis is to develop, build and test a deburring  tool that will measure displacement and augment a deburring force output in both the radial and axial  direction. The standards set within the design parameters will be taken from the perspective of  deburring gas turbine engine parts like the one in Figure 16.

CHAPTER 2  LITERATURE SURVEY 
 

2.1 METHODS OF DIRECT BURR REMOVAL 
Methods of direct burr removal refer to those used by manual operators and have been thoroughly  documented in the aptly titled "Hand Deburring" by LaRoux Gillespie (Gillespie, 2003). Gillespie  documents with great detail the methods and tools used in the hand deburring industry as well as a  number of empirical metrics with which to measure a hand deburring department's performance. Asada  and Asari (1991) developed a method of acquiring/measuring the compliance that a manual operator  applies within their arm and hand when deburring work pieces. Liu and Asada (1991) developed an  adaptive control system for robotic deburring based on the measurement of motion and compliance of  a deburring operator as they finished various pieces.     Various robotic control theories are fascinating and show that looking to manual deburring can provide  valuable insight into improved methods of automated deburring. The tools used in manual deburring  can be used for automated deburring work with the proper modifications and will be incorporated into  the design of the deburring tool. These tools can be sorted into two types and two methods of  implementation. Abrasives (silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide) and hard tools (metal blades) can be used.  These tools can be used either as the tool head of a rotary tool or as a stationary tool.

It is understood that grinding stones and sanding discs wear down and diameters change based in the  state of wear, however this can be measured, predicted and compensated for.  For the basis of the design of this tool, it will be assumed that the tool bit will be one that will maintain  its geometry and be relatively compact, that being a file or grinding stone that basis its material removal  methods on abrasive material removal.   

2.2 PRINCIPLES OF COMPLIANT TOOL HEADS 
2.2.1 NONCOMPLIANT / HARD TOOLING 

Noncompliant tooling is the simple case of a robot with a hardtool deburring end effector (a cutting or  sanding disc or drum, rosette or mounted point that does not deform when a force is applied to it,  mounted on a spindle). The robot follows a distinct tool path in order to deburr the part. There is no  feedback between the robot and controller to ensure that the burrs are being removed effectively, the  robot simply moves through a predetermined tool path and upon completion, returns to its original  position. This approximates a CNC type machining method. Robots are far cheaper to implement but  also much less accurate.  Problems arise even if the robot is properly calibrated and the tool path is exact and repeatable. The  burrs that the robot will encounter are not the same for each part. If a simple, uniform tool path is  implemented on the nonuniform surface, the results will not be repeatable from piece to piece and  may not meet specifications, requiring further manual deburring. Hard tool deburring by robotic means  is widely used but has limitations. It requires a large amount of development in order to calibrate the  process to produce an acceptable result and the process is not robust. A change in the parameters will  alter the finished product, causing need for recalibration.   2.2.2 COMPLIANT TOOLING 

Compliant tooling is a way to deal with the issues that arise from noncompliant / hard tooling.  Compliant tooling requires a tool path that informs the robot of the location of the edge. The robot  moves the tool along the edge like it would with a hard tool end effector, however the tool has the  ability to alter its performance to match the surface characteristics and the burrs that are encountered  in order to produce a smooth and uniform edge. There are two types of compliance tooling, passive  compliance and active compliance.  12   

There are also two different facets of compliance; the field of compliance and the manner in which the  parameters of the cut are controlled. Fields of compliance include Axial and Radial. In the axial field, the  compliance and cutting force is directed along the axis of the tool. In radial compliance, the compliance  is directed perpendicular to the axis of the tool. This can be seen in the Figure 21.    

 
Figure 21  Axial and Radial Compliance (ATI Industrial Automation) 

Passive Compliance  Passive compliant tools alter their shape and the force they apply to a burr in an uncontrolled manner.  Generally the tool is attached to a spring that applies a force in the axial or radial direction. The stiffness  of this spring can be controlled, however no feedback is present. If there is a burr, the tool will be forced  up, displacing the tool and deforming the spring. A deformation will cause an increased cutting force  applied back onto the burr, aiding in its removal. The main principle of passive compliance is based on  Hooke's Law. Another good example of a passive compliant tool is a nylon brush or belt which works on  the same principle but covers more area than the single point hard tool and uses the stiffness of its  bristles as the spring stiffness.  Active Compliance  Active compliance tools have the ability to control the various parameters that define the material  removal on the workpiece. The alterations are determined through some form of burr measurement.  Since burrs are randomized, an active compliance tool must somehow alter the parameters of its  13   

function in order to produce a consistent edge or surface that conforms to the ideal edge and tool path  (existing in virtual space).    There are several types of active compliance. Parameters that can be altered when deburring a surface  include the force applied to the surface, the feed rate that the tool is moving at and the spindle speed of  the tool. Furthermore, the force being applied to the surface can come directly from the robot (coupled)  or from the tool (uncoupled). There are also different ways to sense a burr on a surface and ensure its  removal. Methods include force sensors, cameras, and position sensors to name a few.   Active coupled force compliance requires a robot with a force sensing device to measure the forces and  moments that are created when the tool interacts with the work piece. If the robot experiences a burr,  the forces change. The robot then directly alters the amount of force that it is applying to the work piece  until the force that it senses equals that of the specified force. This method couples the position of the  tool with the force applied as both are handled by the robot simultaneously. This method does not  directly measure burr height and hence the quality of the surface cannot be ensured. It is therefore  more applicable for polishing, where a constant force is more important than a constant or consistent  geometry, as this geometry will already have been brought into compliance through other finishing  techniques.   Decoupled force compliance uses separate systems to provide the overall positioning and deburring  tasks. A robot or CNC machine is used to provide the tool path for the deburring tool and the deburring  tool is used to provide any compliance necessary to perform the material removal. This system allows  for greater versatility. When relying on the robot to provide the cutting force, very specific  characteristics about its performance must be known and continuously monitored. By removing this  requirement and placing it within an end effector that can be switched out to another positioning  system, this complexity is removed. In a decoupled system the robot's only function is to maintain the  proper tool path. 

2.3 EXISTING COMPLIANT TOOLHEADS 
There are many existing compliant tool heads both in industry and in research. The focus of this section  will be on tool heads that are directly relevant to the design of this deburring tool.  First is the Adaptive Deburring Tool (ADT) built by TriKinetics Inc of Waltham MA (UTRC, 1992). This tool  was an active force compliant tool used in a study by United Technology Research Center in partnership 

14   

with Pratt & Whitney in an attempt to produce deburring and edge chamfering of an acceptable quality  for turbine engine parts . Although the tool failed to produce the appropriate edge quality, its design is  worth investigating. 

 
Figure 22  Adaptive Deburring Tool by TriKinetics (UTRC, 1992) 

    As can be seen in Figure 22 above, the tool has a number of features worth noting. Its actuation is  produced by two mechanical motors operating on a drive screw, it has a force sensor for force feedback  of the cutter and it has a 2axis gimbal to allow for smooth pivoting that translates approximately into  planar motion normal to the tool length. This tool did not meet the design criteria in simulation trials  due to the bandwidth of the tool being too great and its reaction time too slow (Pratt & Whitney, 1996).  The United Technologies Research Center also produced a design called CADET (Chamfering And  Deburring Endofarm Tool) from the same study (Pratt & Whitney, 1996). In the same simulation as the  ADT tool above, it passed the requirements for chamfer edge conditions and so development of this tool  progressed (this tool was also Active Force Compliant). The CADET tool utilizes a two axis planar direct  drive voice coil actuator, a spider/universal joint linkage that will transfer the actuated motion towards  the cutter tip with a small enough rotational angle (5 deg) and vertical displacement (0.37mm) that  motion of the cutter can be considered planar. The CADET is shown below in Figure 23 and Figure 24. 

15   

 
Figure 23  CADET tool developed at UTRC (Pratt & Whitney, UTRC, 1996) 

 
Figure 24  CADET Schematic (Pratt & Whitney, 1996) 

16   

The CADET has similar attributes to the ADT however there are some marked improvements. The CADET  also has a two axis gimbal however offset in this case. The CADET has four button load sensors for force  feedback on the cutter through the Force Transducer (labeled in Figure 24). The main attribute of the  CADET that allows a greater accuracy, swifter response and lower bandwidth are the voice coil actuators  that created the motion for cutting compliance (Pratt & Whitney, 1996).   ATI Industrial Automation has two deburring tools commercially available. Both mount to a robot and  are passive force complaint tools. The first is the radially compliant "Flexdeburr" (ATI Industrial  Automation, 2009). This tool, seen in Figure 25 uses compressed air to drive both the spindle and the  compliance of the tool.   

 
Figure 25  ATI's Flexdeburr, a passive radially compliant tool 

17   

 
Figure 26  Flexdeburr Assembly, Ring Actuator highlight (ATI Industrial Automation, 2009) 

  Inside this tool, there is what is known as a Ring Cylinder Assembly. This assembly is a series of  pneumatic pistons arranged radially about the center of the ring. The pistons fill with air to provide a  level of compliance related to the air pressure from the air supply. The ring cylinder assembly can be  seen in the assembly drawing of the Flexdeburr (Figure 26).  Referring to Figure 26 there are some common themes present. Firstly is the presence of a 2axis  rotational joint. In this case it is in the form of a grooved ball joint instead of a gimbal. As well, an  actuator is used here to control the movement of the cutter radially, which will translate into  approximate planar motion. Because this tool is passive compliant, any feedback is absent. The effective  stiffness of the tool is adjusted by controlling the pneumatic pressure input.  The second ATI compliant deburring tool is the Speedeburr, as shown in Figure 17. This tool is a passive  force compliant tool with motion only in the axial direction. The tool's design is relatively simple. It is  composed of a pneumatic spindle set in a simple spring piston cylinder. The pneumatic input pressure  determines the level of compliance of the system (ATI Industrial Automation, 2009).  Each of these tools is mountable to a robot that performs a specific cutting tool path, these tools are  generally in use to remove flash around metal castings and do not provide the precision required for the  task of deburring turbine engine components. 

18   

 
Figure 27 ­ ATI's Speedeburr, a passive axially compliant tool 

  The final tool that must be examined is the tool developed at Ryerson University by Liao and Xi (Liao,  2008). This tool is the precursor to this thesis and so it holds valuable insight. This tool is an axially  compliant tool mounted on a tripod robot. It is pneumatically driven.  As can be seen in Figure 28 and Figure 29, this tool is composed of an aluminum cylinder in which  grooves are machined for three FESTO pneumatic actuators. These actuators are essentially spring  damper systems that contain a spring and an air piston. When air flows into the piston, it extends to a  length dependent on the pressure of the air flow. The movable component of the cylinder is attached to  a moving mount that holds the rotary air spindle in place with set screws, effectively forming a linear  actuator that moves the spindle tool piece, in this case a grinding stone bit, up and down along the axis  of the tool. The air spindle is stabilized by a linear bearing within the main aluminum cylinder. As air is  supplied to both the spindle and the linear actuator, the spindle spins at a prescribed RPM and the  actuator moves to an operating location and provides a level of stiffness/compliance based on the  pressure and air flow provided from the air supply. The controller determines the level of compliance  based upon the readings from an extensometer that are processed through a controller.

The valve used to control the air supply for the actuation of the tool is a proportional directional control  valve with a response frequency of 100Hz. This provides adequate response time for this tool. The tool  head control is best represented in Figure 210. 

 
Figure 210  Schematics of the tool head control system (Liao, 2008) 

  There are many important features of this tool that will be repeated for the design of the hybrid tool.  This tool was designed and constructed using materials that are readily available and some of the  components will be transferred to the new tool for cost savings. With those components, design  features will follow.  The pneumatic spindle will be transferred to the tool and similar FESTO cylinders will be employed.  Similar if not the same control valves will also be utilized and an effort to use as many other components  will be made in order to save costs.   It is important, however to evaluate the design based on its merits to ensure that positive aspects are  carried on and negative ones are not and to avoid basing the design solely on what has been previously  done. In this case, the FESTO cylinders work well. They are durable and allow for even actuation and an  acceptable response time in the modeling (Liao, 2008). Similar can be said for the proportional  directional control valve. These systems can be mimicked. The tripod robot that was used to provide  position control is not desired in this case. Tripod robots are not common in industry and other, more  commercially available options exist that will allow for an easier experimental implementation. Other  design similarities will arise and other items will be changed due to necessity as will be seen later. 

21   

2.4 DESIGN STRATEGIES 
In the previous section a number of deburring tools were reviewed. Design features of these tools will  now be examined in order to organize them in a way that can be used when considering the new tool's  features. First, the axial actuation of applicable tools will be examined, radial actuation will follow,  structure and movement and finally sensing.  Tools that had axial movement were the ATI Speedeburr and Ryerson University's active force compliant  polisher/deburrer. The ATI Speedeburr uses a large spring damper pneumatic piston to provide  compliance while deburring. The Ryerson tool uses a series of spring damper pneumatic pistons. In each  of these cases, this set up works well.  Radial actuation was seen in the ADT by TriKinetics made for UTRC, the CADET by UTRC and ATI's  FlexDeburr. The ADT had actuation provided by two motors operating a drive screw. This tool proved to  be too slow and cumbersome to provide appropriate actuation for the needs of the research team. The  UTRC team decided instead to use voice coil actuators in two planar directions set on bearings in order  to actuate the radial movement on the CADET tool. This method proved successful for a task similar to  that presented in this thesis. The ATI tool used a series of pneumatic spring pistons, arranged radially in  what they referred to as a Ring Actuator Assembly (Figure 28). This ring actuator allowed for passive  compliance in any radial direction due to the distributed force provided by the series of pistons. This  product is successful in its applications of providing passive radial compliance and has a more simplistic  implementation than the voice coil actuators. However the response time is presumably less. Specific  details for this are not available as the FlexDeburr does not involve any feedback.  There are many common themes with structure and movement between the tools. The ADT had a two axis gimbal, allowing the tool to pivot and the tool piece to effectively traverse in a working plane  normal to the axis of the tool. The CADET had two offset axes providing the equivalent to a two axis  gimbal. This was somewhat more complex to allow for the type of sensing that was chosen. The ATI  FlexDeburr used a grooved ball joint to allow for the same two axis rotation. The groove within the ball  joint prevented the tool from rotating about its axis. If this groove was not present, the tool would be  unconstrained and unable to provide the torque and cutting force required to remove material.   In sensing and feedback, the ATI tools are not applicable as they are passive compliant tools. The ADT  tool used a force sensing mount, ie a 6Axis force transducer, similar to one available, aptly, through ATI  Automation (ATI Automation, 2010). This type of sensor is able to measure forces and moments in six  22   

axes. No displacement sensors were utilized. The CADET tool used button load cells placed in a way that  the radial forces were measurable (see Figure 24).  The Ryerson tool used an extensometer to measure  the displacement, not the force, resulting from deburring operations.  Table 23 is a summary of the attributes of each tool as previously discussed:

Reviewing Table 23, some common themes are identified. Movement of these tools is provided by  gimbal axes for radial tools and axial tools use an air driven spring piston method to provide movement.  Pneumatic actuation is a popular choice for passive compliant systems. The tool developed at Ryerson  showed it can also be used for active compliance (Liao, 2008). Other options for actuating the radial  components are available and will be considered in the next section.

[3]     CHAPTER 3 ­ TOOL DESIGN 
In order to design the tool, the highest level requirements must be examined. These requirements are  fundamentally simple and grow more complex as the design evolves to more specific systems and sub systems and their accompanying requirements. In the most basic concept, there is a burr on a work  piece and it is desired that the burr be removed, creating a smooth edge.  In setting out to design a tool to meet the high level requirements, the design will address the  requirements placed on the tool itself and the interactions between the tool and the part that will  produce the desired smooth edge. In this tool, a requirement is that it be compliant in both the axial and  radial directions to allow for more robustness in the deburring process. This requirement can cause the  tool to become complex and difficult to manage. In order to eliminate the complexities of integrating  axial and radial AFC systems, those systems will be decoupled to as great a degree as possible. By  decoupling the two systems and limiting their interaction the architecture of the tool as well as the  supporting control and sensing systems are greatly simplified. From this starting point, further  requirements can be placed on each system.   

3.1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND PARAMETERS 
The design parameters for this tool were formed by considering the task of manual deburring and how  this process can be improved upon as well as the existing designs and previous work in this area that  was discussed in the previous chapter.   Firstly, the tool must be able to work with resources that are readily available in the lab in order to  reduce costs. The budget of the tool was to be kept to within $7000. Several FESTO pneumatic cylinders  as well as tubing and a WESPRO pneumatic spindle tool were available and so were chosen as the stock  parts to be used. Then, based around these parts, the size of the tool must be minimized. A smaller tool  will be more versatile and be able to fit into smaller geometries. The tool must be kept as small as  possible.  The tool must have the capabilities to sense displacements, control displacement and provide cutting  forces in both the radial and axial directions. Displacement can be controlled through cutting forces and  tool stiffness. In accordance with industry standards, a ±0.012" edge profile tolerance is applied to the 

24   

finished edge (Tomastik, 1997), see Figure 31. Because of this, a sensory resolution of <0.012" is  required and preferably <0.004" to have a reasonable idea of the quality of the edge.  

 
Figure 31  Edge Profile Tolerance 

  The size of a burr to be removed is another issue to be considered. Considering the largest burr will  dictate the minimum required travel in the axial and radial directions. Because the maximum  displacement from the tolerance chosen was 0.024", a minimum displacement value of 0.025" was  chosen. This value allows the full range of motion within the tolerable zone. Any protrusion greater than  0.025" will be removed by the tool due to the nature of the deburring setup. In consideration of the  calibration and testing, the tool must be able to be mounted in some manner to a CNC machine or robot  in order to move the tool along a designated tool path.   To recap, the following design requirements have been imposed:  · · · · · · · Must have both axial and radial controlled displacement  Must have axial and radial displacement sensing  Must provide cutting force in axial and radial direction  Must have a sensing resolution of less than .012", preferably less than 0.004"  Must be capable of displacement greater than 0.025"  Tool must be able to mount on robot or CNC for position/tool path control  Tool must be produced and developed on a budget of $7000    Another consideration that is not considered a design parameter but is a matter of practicality is that  components for this tool will obviously have to be produced. The components should be designed in a  way that will allow for the easiest and most cost effective manner of manufacturing.  

25   

3.2  DESIGN IDEAS 
The main design ideas must center on controlling and sensing radial and axial displacement and ensuring  that these two systems remain decoupled. Since previous work had already determined that pneumatic  cylinders were a good way to control the axial displacement (Liao, 2008), this leaves the radial  displacement as well as the axial and radial sensing to be considered (the extensometer used in previous  work was deemed too large to meet the versatility requirement).  For radial actuation, many different approaches were considered. These ideas can be broken into two  types; linkage actuation and axisymmetric actuation. The linkage actuation relies on some form of bar  linkages to provide planar motion that can control the tool's radial position on the radial plane. The axi semetric actuation relies on the principle of a centering force that works against any forces displacing  the tool from the center axis. 

 
Figure 32  Radial actuation concepts 

  As seen in Figure 32a, the linkage actuators form what can be considered two five bar linkages, i.e. two  prismatic joints connected by the outer frame and connected at the center joint. In theory, only one of  these linkages is necessary however in practice, two would be required for symmetric performance. The  manner of actuation of the prismatic joints is a matter of consideration. Drive screw, pneumatic,  solenoid, electrical (voice coil) and mechanical/servo actuation are all considered viable possibilities by  26   

which to enact the force required to provide cutting forces to drive the tool towards the center after it  has been offset by a burr. An important consideration here is that the mirrored linkages would have to  perform in precise tandem with each other and each axis (x and y) requires a separate input channel of  control.  However this aspect also allows for direct control of the position of the tool, the tool would not  have to be centered.   Examining the other option, in Figure 32b, the axisymmetric actuation works on the principle of a  force gradient with respect to displacement from the center. This option has the benefit of minimizing  any mechanical linkage to the center of the tool that could cause coupling with the axial AFC system.  The further from the center the tool bit is displaced by a protruding burr, the greater the force to center  the tool becomes. This concept is applied using pneumatics in the ATI Flexdeburr tool's Ring Actuator  Assembly component seen in Figure 26. Possible actuation methods for this configuration include  magnetic, pneumatic and more exotic materials whose properties are altered by the flow of electric  current (much like synthetic electromechanical muscle tissue (Hirai, 2007)).  In this configuration, only a  single channel would be required, altering the stiffness of the actuator on the basis of the level of  displacement sensed. For the current design requirements, this is sufficient. Specific positioning was not  made a design parameter. Magnetic means of actuation were immediately ruled out due to complexity,  cost and issues that could arise with interference with sensory electronics. Exotic materials that are by  nature expensive and hard to come by were obviously not a practical option and so pneumatic actuation  was deemed the most logical route at this stage of development.  Examining the FESTO cylinders in their employment as axial actuators from a perspective of axial radial  coupling, these cylinders are small and can be designed to function within the radial system in such a  way that the two AFC systems will be independent of each other.  The mechanism to facilitate the movement and pivoting of the radial component while accommodating  the axial components and avoiding any coupling is a matter that requires more consideration. The  previously considered devices used were the 2 axis gimbal, an offset 2 axis gimbal and a grooved ball  joint (a type of universal joint). Of the three, the grooved ball joint is mechanically the simplest.  Unfortunately such a product is not commercially available. The offset 2axis gimbal was a necessity of  that particular design configuration and shares the same principles as the regular gimbal with an added  level of complexity. The concept of a decoupled radial and axial system is illustrated in Figure 33. In this  simple diagram the axial AFC system is affixed to the pivot rod of the radial system, allowing the axial  AFC system to operate independently of the radial system.   27

3.3 TRADE STUDY 
In Table 31, the methods that were found in the literature have been examined are presented.  Considerations of the quality of the option, the availability, the cost and the complexity of its  implementation have been considered and the option has been deemed either acceptable or not:

Examining the chart, many of the options for the design have been eliminated. Turn screws are too slow  to react appropriately, as was found with the TriKinetics tool, voice coils were deemed too expensive  and complex. The air ring piston was a possible option however to acquire one, the entire Speedeburr  tool would have to be purchased and disassembled. Likewise with the grooved ball joint. According to  correspondence with ATI, the ballpark purchase price of one of these tools was $3800$4400. This price  relative to the budget cost makes this option prohibitive. Furthermore, future patents and marketability  were taken into account when the decision was made not to go with those options. What is thus evident  in this chart is that aspects of the tool do not yet exist "off the shelf" and so will have to be designed  from scratch, most notably, the radial sensing and actuation.  Since the axial AFS system already exists and has been proven, the simplest method of design was to  design the radial actuation and sensing around the axial AFS while ensuring that the two systems remain  decoupled. The overarching tool concept was sketched and then a 3D model was created in CATIA. The  tool concept sketch was then formalized into Figure 45.  The initial tool concept is seen in Figure 34: 

 
Figure 34  Initial Tool Concept 

 

29   

Seen in the cutaway model is an outer casing, a 2 axis gimbal fastened to a long shaft. On one end of the  shaft is the axial actuators and the deburring tool piece. On the other end is a concept for the radial  actuator, set at a distance from the axial system. The idea behind this configuration is to use the gimbals  as a 2D pivot point that will allow for a mechanical advantage when exerting radial force and when  sensing displacement. Both force and displacement will be amplified if the upper pivot length is greater  than the lower pivot length. Since the method of actuation and sensing are not known at this stage, built  in mechanical amplification of each seems advantageous as well as providing the added benefit of  ensuring that the two systems are decoupled. After the initial concept was created, the existing  hardware was modeled and then the concept was modified to match the geometric limitations that this  hardware introduced. This model is considered the Mark I model of the tool and is seen in Figure 35. 

 
Figure 35  Mark I Tool Design 

 

3.4 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRA 
Concepts for the radial sensing and actuation were explored earlier. The most attractive concept was  that which mimics the Air Piston ring due to its simplicity. In this vane a concept for a "Pneumatic Ring  Actuator" or PRA was conceived. The PRA in essence is a volume of liquid or gas configured in a torus  shape, contained within an elastic material constrained in such a way that when the inner pressure 

30   

increases, the volume and elastic containment material will expand inward, exerting a centering force  on the pivot rod. The inner pressure is dictated by the level of offset of the pivot rod, sensed by the  radial sensors. In Figure 34, a PRA concept that uses four different chambers made of silicone that fills  with air, expanding to restrict the movement of the center rod. In the Mark I Tool Design, this concept  was changed to a full torus, which would expand based on the dynamic pressure of air flow. The air  would enter through four input ports and exit through four exit ports, inputs and outputs alternate  around the ring. The flow would be controlled by an electric flow valve and back pressure valve.  Development of a Silicone PRA was done as a separate thesis project (Kroeker, 2010). Ultimately the  idea of the Silicone PRA did not work at this design stage due to manufacturability problems and so  other materials were considered including surgical tubing and latex however bicycle inner tube was  chosen as the most promising candidate due to its low cost and easy availability. The tubing was cut into  an appropriate length and then it was stretched around the conduit ring as seen in this diagram: 

 
Figure 36  PRA Bicycle Innertube stretched around Conduit Ring 

  Many methods of fastening the bottom of the PRA were attempted. Glue, wire and zip ties were all  attempted. In the end, a small pipe clamp proved most effective at preventing any air leakage. The best  bicycle tube to suit this purpose was found to be the Axiom 26x2.1252.40" bike inner tube.  

31   

Once the inner tube was stretched around the conduit ring, small holes were burned into the sides at  the site of the threaded holes. Then threaded pneumatic barbs were fitted in and tightened. The process  was tedious and difficult to accomplish without splitting the rubber and having it tear, rendering it  useless. After several attempts the process was refined and properly executed. This configuration  provides an airtight seal with relatively uniform performance. Once the full assembly of the tool is  illustrated (Section 3.6) the exact manner of function of the PRA will become clearer.   

3.5 SENSOR DESIGNS 
Based on the preliminary design, sensors were required for sensing both the radial displacement of the  cap on the pivot rod and the axial displacement of the tool piece. Several ideas were considered on a  conceptual level. These included force measurement strips, optical encoders, laser measurement  systems, potentiometers and magnetic field sensors.   The field of search was first narrowed by practicality. After searching the market for optical encoders,  none were found to exist that were small enough to be applicable to the design. Furthermore, these  devices were very expensive. Laser measurement systems were also prohibitively expensive.   This left force measurement strips, potentiometers and magnetic field sensors to be considered. All of  these were available and considered economical options. These options were explored more explicitly  through conceptual CAD modeling.   3.5.1 RADIAL SENSING 

The force strips use a piezoelectric film to generate a voltage from displacements. These strips are made  by Measurement Specialties. The strips measure in the range of millivolts per unit micro strain. A  conceptual CAD model illustrates how a force strip sensing model would be considered (Figure 37). In  this case, force (or film strip deformation) and center rod displacement would have to be related  through voltage output by proper calibration in order to determine the nature of the sensors. These  strips would be arranged at 90 degrees to each other (2 along the x axis and 2 along the y) and be  displaced by single points of contact extending from the center rod. When the rod is displaced, two of  the strips are deformed, indicating a displacement that could then be determined by the outputs of the  strips. The strips are nonsaturated, i.e. they do not continuously output voltage and will settle to a zero  state after some period of time, regardless of the deformation state. 

32   

 
Figure 37  Force Strip Concept 

  The Honeywell HMC1501 magnetic field sensors are each composed of four anisotropic magneto resistant (AMR) sensing elements configured in a Wheatstone bridge circuit. This configuration allows  for a varying in impedance dependent on the incidence of magnetic field lines with respect to the flow  of current. As the angle at which the field lines impend on the sensor varies, a change in voltage across  the bridge can be measured. See Figure 38 for an illustration. By fixing small magnets to the top of the  pivot rod small movements can be measured through the change in their magnetic field line direction  relative to the stationary sensors. This measured voltage remains a function of the field lines and so,  unlike the force strips, a continuous output from the sensors is available.  

 
Figure 38  HMC1501: A  Wheatstone Bridge Circuit. B ­ Application illustration. (Honeywell) 

33   

  It is because of this continuous output that these sensors were chosen for further study as the radial  sensing components. The sensors still had to conform to the design parameters outlined in Section 3.1.  According to the literature provided by Honeywell, the sensor had a resolution of up to 0.002". This  cited value is twice as good as the 0.004" requirement outlined in the design parameters.   The sensor has a sensing range of +/ 45° and as such, in general use, several are arranged in a line in  order to track the position of a magnetic object. In this case, only one in each direction will be necessary  as the displacements of the pivot rod are not estimated to exceed 0.100".   For further technical specifications on this device and the sensory electronics, see Appendix B.  Figure 39 shows the configuration of the HMS1501 sensors in relation to the magnets mounted on the  top end of the pivot rod. These sensors are positioned on a round circuit board to allow the sensors to  be in the same plane as the magnet. The four cylindrical spacers seen on the round circuit board allow  for an additional board to be mounted on top, which holds the additional electronics. This sensor  configuration allows sensing of the radial displacement only and is fully independent of the axial AFC  system. A wealth of information about the HMS1501 magnetic sensor can be found through the  Honeywell website (Honeywell, 2010).

3.5.2

AXIAL SENSING 

In investigating axial position sensors, the objective was to find the smallest sensor possible that would  indicate position to within at least 0.004". No extensometer or optical encoder was available that was  deemed of appropriate size. A single product was located and so was procured and incorporated into  the design; The Celesco M150 cable extension position transducer (a.k.a. String Potentiometer or  "StringPot"). This product was an out of the box "plug and play" that would return an output  proportional in scale to the input based on the level of extension of its attached cable.  

Figure 310  Celesco M150 "StringPot" Mounted and Unmounted 

  As seen in Figure 310, the StringPot mounts to the side of the spindle housing and the extension cable  is connected to the spindle ring to measure the displacement between the casing and the spindle ring,  effectively measuring the axial displacement between the cutting bit and the tool. This device was small  enough to be incorporated onto the axial AFC system without affecting the radial in any way, again  ensuring no coupling.           

35   

3.6 FINAL DESIGN 
The final design of the tool can be seen in Figure 311 in this cutaway illustration: 

 
Figure 311  HFCDT Cutaway Illustration 

  In Figure 311, many of the components mentioned before can now be seen integrated together and  examining the configuration, it is clear that the radial system was designed around the axial one, not  with it, allowing the benefits that decoupled tool architecture provides. Some components have been  left out and are shown in Figure 312 for clarity.  

36   

 
Figure 312  Cutting End of the HFCDT for clarity 

  In creating the final design, the geometric constraints were set by the hardware that was initially  provided. The FESTO cylinders for example were of a certain size that to configure only three, evenly  spaced, would have meant that there would not have been sufficient room on the circumference of the  spindle housing to also accommodate the gimbal axle mounts. This forced a configuration of 4 evenly  spaced FESTO cylinders to allow a direct line for the axles. Grappling with this geometric constraint as  well as the diameters of the linear bearing and the spindle diameter resulted in the final spindle housing  geometry and subsequently the diameter of the tool in general.    The PRA can be seen at the top of the tool in Figure 312 and also in Figure 36. The PRA has 8 barbed  pneumatic ports. Four of these are for air input and four are for exhaust. This is to provide an even  distribution of air flow throughout the ring as the flow and pressure changes and the PRA expands or  contracts, exerting a centering force about the pivot rod.  Materials used were Aluminum 6061 and SAE1020 Steel. Aluminum was chosen for its light weight and  ease of machinability and the steel was chosen for components where stiffness or wear were considered  more important than being light weight.  

37   

The idea of using the gimbal as a pivot point in order to magnify the displacement caused by an offset  burr so that the radial sensors could, in effect, have a higher resolution was employed in the final design  and is a marked distinction between this design and other radial deburring tools investigated in Section  2.3.  In this case, the combined distance from the gimbal plane to the radial sensors is 9.25". The  distance from the point of contact with the tool piece and the gimbal axis will vary depending on burr  size however the nominal distance is 2.25". Any variation in the lower axial distance caused by deburring  operation would be trivial in determining the scaling factor however can be accounted for using direct  online measurements from the axial sensor. This means that a radial displacement of 0.001" on the tool  tip will result in a radial sensor reading of 0.0041". This is important considering that displacement in  different directions will be measured differently because the radial displacement is determined through  the x and y measurements from each of the magnetic sensors. The smallest reading for any given radial  displacement would occur if that displacement was 45 deg from each HMS1502 sensor.  These values are theoretical and do not take into account any interplay between mating parts or the  bending of components. These additional considerations are very difficult, complex and time consuming  to model and would have required experimental verification. As such, it was decided to forego modeling  and determine this relationship directly through experimentation. As will be seen later, this relationship  is significant.  Considerations for manufacturing and assembly were accounted for as well. Manufacturing  considerations will be explored in Section 5. Considerations for assembly included fitting Spindle  Housing A and B together with the linear bearing inside and positioning this assembly within the outer  casing.  The spindle housing assembly then had to be fastened to the gimbal ring and the gimbal ring to  the outer casing. All of these items had to fit while providing clearance for the accessories that are  fastened to the main components as well as provide space for pneumatic tubing to supply the air spindle  and the FESTO cylinders. Set screws are employed to fasten the air spindle to the spindle ring and the  linear bearing within Spindle Housing A. As mentioned before, each component was modeled in CATIA  and the entire tool was assembled virtually in order to ensure clearance during assembly and proper  fitting.   Design of the End Cap (Figure 313) had to allow for enough space for the sensors, electronics, cable  connectors and air circulation to cool the electronics. This was accomplished by increasing the height of  the end cap, thereby increasing its internal volume. 

38   

 
Figure 313  End Cap with view of internal volume 

  Another consideration was the location and configuration of the tool mount. The tool mount is a forked  piece fastened to a cylinder sized at 1" in order to accommodate a tool chuck, see Figure 314. This  mount was situated as close as geometries would permit to the gimbal axis in order to avoid as much  bending of the tool as possible. The mount was made of steel for increased stiffness. The mount is  fastened to the outer casing using two threaded rods and four accompanying nuts. The mounting holes  in the casing are also threaded for added stiffness.  

 
Figure 314  Tool Mount 

39   

Also seen in Figure 314 is the opening for the air spindle pneumatic feed. Special consideration was  taken in making sure that after the spindle was inserted the elbow joint for the spindle could be  attached using its threaded connection. The opening is elongated so that the spindle can move freely in  the axial direction while the spindle housing and the outer casing both remain fixed.  The outer casing of the tool tapers to a radius slightly larger than that of the axle bearings. This is to  maximize the clearance of the tool. By having a minimum amount of material close to the work piece,  the tool will be able to fit into more confined spaces than if this taper did not exist. This also allows for  much better access to components.   Overall the design of this tool successfully combined axial and radial AFC systems in a decoupled manner  that followed the functions and parameters that were outlined with as many off the shelf components  as was possible. CATIA design software was instrumental in the successful design and assembly of the  components of the tool as well as the generation of technical drawings that were essential for the  machining of each component. The final machined and assembled tool can be seen in Figure 315.

[4]     CHAPTER 4 ­ ANALYSIS 
The following chapter will develop a model that will allow the tool to react to a burr by removing it  through abrasive cutting. This model will require three separate theories to be developed / presented,  see Figure 41. The first is the mechanical modeling of the tool. This modeling will predict the theoretical  behavior of the tool by splitting the model into the decoupled radial and axial components and laying  out the mechanics of each system. The toolpart interaction will be accounted for using Hertzian Contact  theory and abrasive cutting theories will be presented to model the removal of the burr. Once this  modeling is developed it is presented in a Matlab Simulink simulation to illustrate the ideal behavior of  the tool. Values derived from Chapter 5, the testing of the tool, are used within this simulation to  validate the model and infer further characteristics.

    41   

4.1 TOOL MODELING 
The overarching structure of the decoupled axial and radial AFC systems is very prevalent in modeling  the tool. Due to their decoupled nature, each system can be modeled separately. In no part of the  modeling do the two systems interact. While the two systems encounter an identical burr, the  interaction of each system with that burr is independent of the other.  4.1.1 GLOBAL REFERENCE COORDINATES 

To begin the modeling, it is necessary to establish a global positioning system for the tool. This system  will use the two gimbal axes as the global X (XG) and global Y (YG) coordinates with the positive global Z  (ZG) axis in the direction of the cutting end of the tool. This global position can be seen in Figure 42.  After establishing these global coordinates, gimbal rotations can be considered as Euler Angles in an XYZ  convention. Identifying the direction of the tool (ZG) as the theoretical vector direction N, a rotation of  angle  about XG can be made, followed by a rotation of angle  about y'. This is shown in Eq. (4.1).

  Multiplying Eq. (4.2) through, the unit vector is achieved with respect to the Global Axes: 

sin sin cos cos cos
 

 

4.3  

43   

At this point it is useful to introduce the concept of the "Action Plane". Due to the axisymmetric nature  of this tool, all forces and motions can be placed within this plane, regardless of the gimbal angles. The  action plane is a plane formed by the ZG axis and the vector produced from the XG axis being rotated an  angle y about ZG. This vector will be considered as x'. The angle y is dictated by the unit vector Eq. (4.3)  through the following equation:

This relationship is illustrated graphically in Figure 43.

    and the formation of the Action Plane can be seen in Figure 44 

44   

 
Figure 44  Action Plane defined from global coordinates 

  This action plane rotates to be parallel to the force incident on the tool head and is dependent on that  force.    4.1.2 ACTION PLANE MODELLING 

Having established the Action Plane with respect to the Global coordinate system, the axisymmetric  properties now allow the tool to be modeled within that plane, effectively reducing the complexity of  the tool modeling to a 2dimensional system. This allows a simplification of the tool kinematics. Seen in  Figure 45 is a 2D schematic view of the tool. This is the tool as it exists, ideally, within the action plane  and it is from this view that the remainder of the tool modeling will take place. 

45   

 
Figure 45  HFCDT Schematic 

46   

In modeling the mechanics within the action plane, the axial and radial components will be modeled  separately because they are decoupled. Successful modeling of the two systems in this manner will  illustrate their decoupled nature. The radial AFC system is more complex and will be undertaken first. In  modeling the radial AFC it will be useful to understand the relationship between the radial motion of the  upper end of the pivot (upon which the radial sensors will measure displacement) and the lower end of  the pivot (where the tool piece contacts the burr). In this sense,   can be taken as the displacement  sensed by the radial sensors and   can be taken as the displacement of the tool piece, caused by the  presence of a burr. The relationship between the two can be expressed in Eq. (4.5).  

 
 

4.5

The velocities of the upper and lower radial positions are expressed in a similar fashion in Eq. (4.6). 

 
 

4.6

The acceleration of the upper and lower radial positions are also expressed in similar fashion in Eq. (4.7) 

 
 

4.7

The principle behind the radial modeling in the 2D action plane is the summation of the moment forces  about the pivot axis. The relationship of the pivot axis angular position and movement with the upper  and lower radial positions and movement is necessary to understand before introducing these  moments. The relationship between the angular position and the radial positions are expressed in Eq.  (4.8). Figure 46 illustrates the location of these values for a better understanding.

From Eq. (4.8)   can be determined using Eq. (4.5).    47

The values for   and   can be found using the same pivot length ratio as was employed in Eq. (4.5).  The summation of moments, shown in Eq. (4.12), will now be introduced and the derivations of each will  be presented.

as the new burr height  . Angular acceleration is determined through Eq. (4.16) where   is the angular  moment of inertia about the pivot axis of the moving components of the tool. The added 2  term is  used to express the angular acceleration   in radians.

4.16

Once the angular acceleration is known, the angular velocity can be determined by integration as seen  in Eq. (4.17). 

   

4.17

The angular position can be determined by integrating Eq. (4.17) once more, as seen in Eq. (4.18). 

 
 

4.18

By assuming  and   are equal to zero, the angular velocities and position are now known. The angular  velocity can be used to calculate the damping effects on   through Eq. (4.14) and Eq. (4.15) and 

the angular position can be used to determine the new burr height through Eq. (4.19) using Eq. (4.5) and  Eq. (4.9). 


 

4.19

The term   from Eq. (4.19) represents the change in distance of the tool head from its original position    . This change in position must be subtracted from the original position to determine the new position   as in Eq. (4.20).

In order to produce a standard second order DE that represents the forces of the tool from the  perspective of the tool tip, the relationships presented in Eq. (4.5) to Eq. (4.15) are used to produce Eq.  (4.21).

The axial modeling for this tool can be transferred from the previous tool, the Active Force Compliant  Axial Deburring Tool (Liao, 2008) and adapted for the different FESTO cylinder model and a change in  the number of cylinders. The model is essentially a spring damper system, modeled using the axial  components in the schematic seen in Figure 45.

4.2 TOOL ­ PART INTERACTION 
To begin with, consider the Hertzian contact model; with two discs, of radii   1,  1,  2,  2 being the  disc radii and disc edge radii respectively. According to the Hertzian contact model, when these two  discs are forced together the discs deform, creating an elliptical stress area. See Figure 47 for an  example of idealized Hertzian Contact.   

F  Force Applied

Figure 47  Hertzian Disc Contact 

 

   The contact area of the two discs forms an elliptical contact surface. This surface is seen in Figure 48.  The size and shape of the contact ellipse is dependent on several factors including the material  properties of the opposing discs as well as the contact force between them. First the compressive  principle stress will be defined for this area, followed by the mechanics that define the dimensions and  the stress distribution within the elliptical contact area and finally, the forces in terms of one disc  impending upon the other will be presented.

4.3 ABRASIVE CUTTING THEORY 
There has been much recent work on abrasive cutting theory and the idea of the cumulative effect of  varying sizes of grain particles affecting a work surface. Williams and Xie (Williams & Xie, 1996) created a  simulation model that combines the contacts between a soft work surface and grains of sizes varying  through a Gaussian distribution. The model predicts the overall coefficient of friction and the wear rate  on the soft surface by employing three types of interaction, Elastic deformation (shakedown) through  basic friction modeling, plastic deformation (through empirical approximation) and micro chipping  through a cutting model (Williams & Xie, 1996). Zhou and Xi further the concept of a Gaussian  distribution of grain sizes in order to create a theory base and software that accurately demonstrates  grinding and polishing surfaces and operations when compared to empirical results (Zhou & Xi, 2002);  (Xi & Zhou, 2005). 

56   

 
Figure 49  Polishing stone topography (Xi & Zhou, 2005) 

  The abrasive cutting theory presented in the above mentioned literature can be drawn on and combined  with the Hertzian contact modeling to explain the deburring process of the edge deburring tool  assuming a grinding stone tool piece is employed. After a stone topography is generated through  Gaussian distribution (Figure 49) a semispherical grain profile is assumed and the Brinell hardness scale  is employed as the basis of the depth of penetration of the grains.   An algorithm called the "Search Method" (Xi & Zhou, 2005) first determines the maximum depth of cut  from the largest grain size.  In Eq. (4.40) this is shown, where    is the total force (cutting force)  imposed on the tool piece,  work piece material.      is the radius of the largest grain and   is the Brinell Hardness of the

Where   is the force applied on grain   . Using this method, micro depth of cut calculations were  tabled alongside experimental data and assumed to equal surface roughness. For deburring applications  however, it is advantageous to use these values as depth of cut.

Experimental h µm  0.70.8  0.50.6  0.250.3 

These depth of cut values represent the material removal rate per cutting area proportional to work  piece area. That is to say that for 1mm2 of work surface, 1mm2 of abrasive performing one full pass shall  remove material to the depth specified by the depth of cut. This proportionality allows for simplification  in a 2D interpretation whereby 1mm lengthwise abrasive surface passing once over a 1 mm length of  cross sectional work surface length will remove material equal to the cutting depth. Applying this 

58   

relationship to a cylindrical or spherical grinding stone, the rate at which the tool progresses to remove  the burr can be determined. This is illustrated in Figure 410. 

 
Figure 410  Tool  Burr contact 

  By comparing the burr width,  , to the circumference of the cutting stone (assuming   >>   ) and 

multiplying by the cutting depth and then by the rate of rotation of the tool, the rate at which the burr is  removed can be defined, as in Eq. (4.43).      In Eq. (4.43) it is assumed that cutting depth value is accurate and that the width of the burr is known.  As discussed in earlier sections, the nature of the burr is that it is irregular and rarely known ahead of  time, hence the need for an adaptive, active compliant tool. For the purpose of theory and simulation  though, this is acceptable.   The final value to be determined is the cutting damping ratio,   to be applied alongside the tool

damping ratio. This value is found in Eq. (4.44) where   is the cutting force applied.

4.4 SIMULATION MODEL 
The basis of the simulation model comes from an accumulation of the above theory, modeled in  Matlab's Simulink. The simulation has two components to it, the axial portion and the radial portion and  is limited to the tool itself; it does not model the air system that supports it. Integrating an air system  model would add a level of complexity that is beyond the scope of the thesis. A complete air system  model is available for the axial polishing and deburring tool from (Liao, 2008).  Because the Radial and Axial AFC systems are decoupled, they are modeled separately. The radial  portion is based around the summation of moments about the pivot axis. Stiffness values were used  that reflect the measurements provided from Section 5.5.3. The axial model is straightforward and also  uses measurements from Section 5.5.3 in order to ensure that the input was reflective of the  experimental results.  In reference to Figure 411, the simulation begins from the generation of the burr. The signal  representing the displacement of the tool head from the work piece edge that is being deburred is  summed with any chamfer offset provided and the calculated burr reduction is subtracted, Eq. (4.20)  can be equated to this. The new burr height is then converted to the cap displacement where the PRA  actuator is, employing Eq. (4.5). Using Hook's law, the force that the PRA applies to the end cap is  determined. This is then multiplied to the upper pivot length to determine the moment applied to the  gimbal axis, as with Eq. (4.13). This moment is summed with the calculated effects of the damping from  the PRA and the cutting Eq. (4.12).  The summed moment is multiplied by 2 to place the value into radians and divided by the moment of  inertia, I, about the pivot axis, which was determined through CATIA modeling Eq. (4.16). This value now  represents the angular acceleration, in radians. This value is integrated to find the angular velocity Eq.  (4.17). The angular velocity or rate of rotation about the gimbal axis is useful in finding the effects of  damping on the moment through Eq. (4.14) and Eq. (4.15). Damping values from cutting are calculated  using the equations developed from Section 4.3. Damping values from the PRA are not known and so  the system is calibrated to determine these values by adjustment to a level that provides the desired  edge profile from the burr profile readout.   60   

The angular velocity signal is integrated again after sampling for damping effects to provide the angular  position at the gimbal axis Eq. (4.18) and then the lower pivot length is applied to determine the  displacement of the tool from the work piece edge Eq. (4.19).  

 
Figure 411  Radial AFS Simulation 

  Another characteristic of the radial aspect of the tool that had to be incorporated into the model was  that the damping of the tool due to cutting only occurs when the tool is moving in the direction of the  burr, and as such, a switch was added to the cutting damping feedback loop to illustrate this. Within the  radial portion of the tool it was also assumed that the position could not be negative, that is to say that  the tool could not move beyond the center axis of the tool. Theoretically, it is possible that the angular  momentum of the tool could carry it beyond the zero point however this is not a practical scenario for  simulation.  Results of the radial deburring simulation can be seen in Figure 412. In this figure, the tool encounters  the burr and effectively removes it. The values used for this simulation are seen in Table 42.

    Viewing the results of the simulation, it can be seen that the simulation correctly demonstrates the burr  removal ability of the tool and that the systems can function well in a decoupled manner.

[5]     CHAPTER 5 ­ FABRICATION AND TESTING 
The original planned outline of this thesis was to fully design, manufacture and test this tool by  attempting to deburr features of a turbine disc. This deburring was to occur on a CNC machine with the  tool performing online adjustments in stiffness based on the data collected from its sensors. Time  constraints and certain practical limits made this plan too ambitious. Instead, it was decided that the  testing will conclude with static testing of the tool's behaviors in the radial and axial directions. The  decoupled design of the tool allows for the testing of the axial and radial components to be entirely  decoupled from each other and performed separately. The sensors and stiffness will be investigated  only in the settled state. The transient behavior of the tool and any time variable characteristics will be  left to others to investigate.   This section will also explain certain considerations taken when designing for manufacturing, the  manner in which the tool was calibrated (including the design considerations and the final design of the  test rig) and the final test results which explain the behavior of the tool with respect to different  pressures and forces as well as investigate whether certain assumptions in the theoretical modeling in  Section 4 are actually applicable.   

5.1 TOOL FABRICATION 
Tool components were machined at Apollo Machining in Mississauga, Ont. The total cost of machining  the tool components came to $3500. This price did not include the test rig which will be discussed later.   Special care was taken to minimize the total cost of the machining when possible by considering the  number of tool changes and set up changes that would be required for the features on each component.  Many radii and dimensions were driven by the practical capabilities of the milling and turning operations  and the effects that those dimensions would have on the process.  For example, if one sized milling bit could be used to machine the features of an entire part, this would  reduce the process time and number of tool changes. If a part could be machined on a lathe or mill with  only one set up, additional cost savings could be found there. This is the manner in which the stipulation  that "components should be designed in a way that will allow for the easiest and most cost effective  manner of manufacturing" from Section 3.1 was met. 

65   

5.2 CALIBRATION 
5.2.1 Test Rig Design 

Prior to calibrating the tool, a test rig to calibrate and test the tool had to be conceived. This test rig had  the following design parameters placed on it:  · · · · · Must be able to apply and measure force in multiple directions for radial testing  Must be able to measure small displacements of the tool tip (0.001" resolution)  Must be able to measure small displacements at the sensor end (0.001")  Must be rigid enough that bending of the rig would be negligible   Must be adjustable for versatility 

These parameters would be accommodated by the fact that an optics table would be used to mount all  of the equipment and that the tool would be held steady in place by a vice, fixed to the table. Some  adjustments would be made available by the vice and positioning on the table.   The test rig was designed on CATIA in the same manner in which the actual tool was. Figure 51 shows  an image of the test rig, with parts labeled and with the tool also present where it would be during  testing. Seen on the right is a turnscrew. This turnscrew is used to apply a displacement to the tool tip.  Directly in contact with the turnscrew, between the turn screw and the tool tip is a load cell to measure  the force. The load cells are both Full Bridge ThinBeam load cells made by Omega. Both 1 lb and 10 lb  load cells were acquired and both are able to fit in the rig.  Opposite to the turnscrew is a dial indicator capable of measuring to within 0.0001" with a range of  0.025". The base of the rig is adjustable so that the dial indicator, which is fixed to the CMount, can be  positioned directly adjacent to the tool piece and the turnscrew then adjusted to position the load cell  directly opposite.  Figure 52 shows this configuration, which is used for radial testing. Note that the  shape of the CMount allows the mount to be adjusted to a 45° or 90° angle, to test for radial uniformity  in performance.

Load Cell Calibration 

The dial indicator came from the manufacturer as calibrated and so the only part of the test rig that  needed calibration was the load cells. To calibrate these, weights were suspended from the cell in  appropriate increments based on the total weight rating of the load cell.  

67   

 
Figure 53  Calibrating the load cells (10 lb cell pictured) 

  The load cell power supply was adjusted with each load cell so that the total load of 1 lb or 10 lbs would  provide a 10V output to the DAS. Weights between 0 and the maximum load were also loaded onto the  cell to ensure that the relationship was linear.  The 1 lb calibration chart is shown here. The 10 lb load  cell was similar however scaled up x10.

5.2.3

Tool Sensor Calibration 

Radial and Axial tool sensors had to be calibrated in order to properly interpret the collected data. These  sensors were calibrated using the test rig and another displacement sensor which had a longer probe  with more travel and was hence more versatile. The end cap was set up with the test rig as shown in  Figure 55.  

 
Figure 55  Radial Sensor Calibration

Because this displacement probe was calibrated to millimeters, the axes are in Volts and Millimeters.

Note that the two graphs have some differences. The Xsensor graph has a more refined plot of points  while the Ysensor graph has a larger spread. In each case, the relationship is linear and the rate at  which the voltage changes is 1.1 V/mm for the Xsensor and 1.2 for the Ysensor. These values can be  used in order to calibrate online response to tip displacement when the tool is running a deburring tool  path.   While these tests were run, cross talk between the sensors was measured. By this, what is meant is that  the magnetic field used to sense displacement in X is also impending on the Y sensor. Movement of the  magnet will effect changes in voltage of both sensors. The amount of unintended change was recorded  determined and is shown here. The effect is minimal however can still be compensated for if deemed  necessary.

  The axial sensor used was the M150 Celesco StringPotentiometer as mentioned in section 3.5.2. This  sensor was calibrated by displacing the spindle ring with spacers of known thicknesses and comparing  this to the output of the M150. The results were linear, as expected. The calibration is shown below:

5.3 TESTING 
5.3.1 Data Acquisition System 

The Data Acquisition System used was a USB1208FS unit from Measurement Computing. This unit was  used in its 4 channel 12bit differential input mode to collect data from the PCB boards within the HFCDT  as well as from the load cell. 

 
Figure 510  DAS USB1208FS unit from Measurement Computing 

  The USB1208FS connects directly to the computer via USB. Signals were read using a Simulink program  and then MATLAB was used to analyze the collected data.    5.3.2 Testing Method 

Several different tests were done in order to determine the characteristics of the tool. All of the sensors  were calibrated (Section 5.2.3). Then the overall radial tool stiffness was measured at different PRA  pressures. Tests were then done to determine the level of internal bending that was occurring within  the tool with no PRA pressure and at the maximum PRA pressure tested. These tests were followed by  axial stiffness tests to determine the relationship between the FESTO cylinders and the axial stiffness of  the tool. The following images illustrate each of the tests concisely. The test set up to measure axial  stiffness is seen in Figure 511. The test set up to measure the internal bending of the tool is shown in  Figure 512. The test set up to measure the axial stiffness of the tool is shown in Figure 513.

TEST RESULTS 

The test results of the tool were tabulated and plotted in Excel. The graphs are displayed in the following  pages along with some comments interpreting the behavior of the tool. All pressures are gauge  pressure. 

 
Figure 514  Stiffness Plot of PRA at pressures 0 22 PSI  

  Test results of the radial stiffness were intuitive for the most part. The stiffness is very nearly linear for  each of the pressures measured and what is most interesting is that each of the curves, once within its  linear portion, tends to have a very similar slope, showing that the escalation of the stiffness is equal,  regardless of the pressure. Ideally, each line indicating a pressure level would have been evenly spaced  with respect to each other however the limitations of the tool in its construction instead created the  spread that is seen here.   Another way to view this data is by looking at the stiffness based upon different distances as data lines.  The following graph shows each distance as a data line, the pressure along the x axis and the stiffness 

76   

along the y. This interpretation could be useful when selecting a pressure to stiffen the tool to a stiffness  based upon the deflection of the tool and the cutting parameters.  
 

 
Figure 515  Stiffness vs Pressure 

   The plotted lines for displacements 0.015" to 0.024" were only partially plotted due to the limitation of  the 10 lb force sensor. The data points available were extrapolated to show the stiffness up to 22 psi.  Comparison of tip displacement and end cap displacement shows that there is a significant amount of  internal bending within the tool components. With the exception of no gauge pressure, the movement  sensed on the end cap with that of the tip displacement was similar for all pressures and was  significantly less than the ideal amount of displacement. Figure 516 shows the measurements in  relation to one another and Figure 517 shows a curve indicative of the trend (created by averaging the  characteristics of each quadratic trend line) with respect to the ideal level of displacement. 

77

78   

Axial stiffness testing revealed that the tool will provide an equal amount of force, regardless of the axial  displacement of the tip. This creates a relationship where the axial force applied is solely dependent on  the gauge pressure of the pneumatic cylinders.    

 
Figure 518  Axial Force vs Displacement 

  Measurements indicated that the force applied in the backward direction, i.e. returning to the original  position after displacing the tool tip to its maximum point was significantly less than the forward force  applied. All of the forces are tabulated below in Figure 519 to showing the relationship between the  pressure within the FESTO pneumatic cylinders and the amount of force that is applied. The relationship  of the two plotted lines (forwards and backwards) with respect to each other indicates that an  additional force is at play. This could be a frictional force attributed to nonideal construction of the  tool's components as the force is working in both directions.

[6]     CHAPTER 6 ­ CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 

6.1 CONCLUSIONS 
After viewing the results, valuable insight has been gained into the characteristics of the tool, its  performance and aspects of its design and construction. From this study and design exercise, the  following insights were gained:  · The automation of deburring and edge finishing is not a trivial process. It requires the precision  and repeatability of an automated process incorporated with the robustness and adaptability of  a manual process. Because of the transient nature of the machining process (constantly varying  levels of tool wear, varying cutting paths and microstructure, etc...) no two burrs are alike and as  a result, no two deburring passes will encounter the same conditions.    · Many forms of compliant tooling exist for deburring and edge finishing, both manual and  automated, most of which are passive compliant tools. Throughout the literature no other tool  was found that attempts to incorporate both axial and radial active compliance into a single  tool.     · A variety of different types of actuation and sensing were investigated.  Various Pneumatic  methods of actuation, turn screw, voice coil and magnet actuation were explored for both  effectiveness as well as cost. Methods of motion were also looked at. Gimbals, universal joints,  ball joints and other modes of transmission were explored based on both literature and creative  design. Through defining specific design parameters and with use of trade studies, a design was  configured that balanced effectiveness with complexity and cost.    · CATIA is a highly effective and efficient method of generating the specific geometries of design.  Within CATIA, the configuration for the deburring tool was developed, all stock items were  defined and then original part dimensions were configured. Then the technical drawings were  generated to produce a complex tool with many different moving parts. All of these parts fit  together on the first try with only minor, designer based issues that were easily resolved. It is 

81   

highly recommended that any future design be based through this design tool or a comparable  CAD software package.    · The sensor system designed for this tool proved remarkably effective. The radial sensing,  centered around the Honeywell HMC1501 magnetic sensors and the electronics that were built  around these devices functioned beyond their expected accuracy and attained a resolution  >0.002". This resolution could be further enhanced through greater signal filtering and  processing.     · The Pneumatic Ring Actuator, while in concept is of sound principle, needs further  development. Fashioning a precision deburring actuator through tedious, laborious means from  bicycle tubing is not a preferred manufacturing method. More shall be mentioned in the Section  6.3 about the development of the PRA.     · The mechanical design of the tool was sound in theory however in practice several things were  revealed to need improvement. The center assembly of the tool consisting of the two spindle  housings needs to be much stiffer. When dealing with such small displacements as those  encountered in deburring, even the slightest bending can skew the data and although such  bending can be accounted for, it reduces the accuracy and response of the tool while  complicating any modeling.    · The tool overall was an excellent first iteration of a radialaxial active force compliant deburring  tool. Experimentation demonstrated its effectiveness at sensing burr displacement and thereby  its potential to respond. Future design iterations should take note of frictional loss/interference  from the size and configuration of the joints and moving parts (configured and dimensioned to  reduce cost and provide an ease in demonstration) and incorporate the lessons learned from  this work into future design iterations.        

82   

6.2 MAIN RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS 
As was demonstrated in the literature review, there has, up until now, not been a deburring tool that  has incorporated both the axial and radial components of active compliant deburring in a single tool.  This thesis presents the process of designing, manufacturing and testing such a tool in a way that is  transparent and reproducible.   · The active force compliant deburring tool designed here is based on the principle that the axial  and radial components can be incorporated with little to no coupling, allowing minimal interface  between the two systems. This decoupling allows for a simpler design and control architecture.  Through this work, it has been proven that the decoupled configuration presented is a practical  and viable method of employing axial and radial active force compliant deburring.    · Models of the radial and axial AFC systems were created and successfully implemented. These  models demonstrate the mechanics of the burr removal systems and their successful  implementation illustrates the decoupled nature of the tool. The modeling of the tool was also  used to infer values of the tool itself.    · Within this design, the axial deburring system is incorporated into the pivoting portion of the  radial system. Although pivoting itself was utilized on the CADET device from UTRC, in this case  it was used for mechanical advantage in both actuation and sensing.  Although bending within  the device negated this mechanical advantage, the premise remains and can be improved upon.  This configuration is unique and has not been attempted before.    · The proposed concept of the PRA is also new. Within the FlexDeburr tool from ATI (see Figure  26) their ring actuator uses a series of air pistons arranged radially about a center rod. The tool  itself is also a passive compliant tool with no feedback or control. The PRA presented here uses a  volume of gas (or liquid) configured in a torus shape, contained within an elastic material  constrained in such a way that when the inner pressure increases, the volume and elastic  material will expand inward, exerting a centering force on the pivot rod. The inner pressure is  dictated by the level of offset of the pivot rod sensed by the radial sensors. This type of actuator  is not apparent in any literature and as such is a novel idea.    83   

·

 The radial sensing system that was conceived for the purpose of this thesis is unique. By  mounting magnets on the cap of the pivot rod, magnetic sensors could determine the  displacement in the X and Y directions. The circuitry that was designed for this sensing system  allowed a resolution of >0.002" to be achieved. It was unclear what type of accuracy such  sensors would provide. This testing has provided performance specifications on this sensor  configuration that will be invaluable in future designs. No sensing system resembling this type  was apparent in the literature and as such this too is a unique and novel contribution.   

·

Combining all of the new design contributions with those that were collected through review of  existing tools, a configuration was produced that is unique in its architecture and illustrates the  first iteration of a design tool that will incorporate both radial and axial active force compliant  deburring. The design process and the lessons that can be inferred from the results and  conclusions of this thesis, the methods that worked well and those that need improvement will  provide valuable insight for future iterations of this design. 

 

6.3 FUTURE WORK 
The focus of this research was to develop a tool configuration that would allow for active force  compliance both in the axial and radial direction. There are many other aspects of a system that would  provide this active compliance to be developed as well as improvements upon the current design that  can be pursued.  · The PRA should be further developed to provide a more consistent shape and a more  conventional and convenient application. Medical silicone product manufacturers should be  investigated for this purpose. Further exploration on this topic can be found in (Kroeker, 2010).  By manufacturing a consistent rubber or silicone product, the tool can be more easily  reproduced and will benefit from more uniform performance.     · There are several mechanical improvements that the tool can undergo. The center pivot section  should be redesigned so that it is of greater stiffness. A change in the geometry (make it shorter  to reduce bending, as the sensors employed are now known to have sufficient resolution) as  well as a change in material will allow for less bending of the tool and increased performance. A  84   

shorter, smaller air spindle and smaller FESTO cylinders should also be incorporated to make the  tool more compact and versatile. The gimbals that facilitated the rotation required for the radial  motion should also be improved. This can be enhanced either by a higher quality (more  expensive) 2 axis gimbal system or a change to a grooved ball joint like that found in the  FlexDeburr (Figure 26 and accompanying discussion) to reduce slack and friction.    · The control system for this tool has yet to be developed. Modeling and controlling the entire air  system volume is an immense undertaking in and of itself. Much of the groundwork for this was  accomplished in (Liao, 2008) and the future works of that thesis can be referenced for further  guidance on that front.     · Once the above mentioned future works are accomplished, a means by which to test the tool on  line and eventually incorporate the tool into potential manufacturing processes should be  developed. A method of signal transfer and processing (there are wireless possibilities here as  well as on board processing), a means of incorporating the tool with a positioning system,  whether it be CNC or Robotic and software to generate tool paths that incorporate the  geometry and behavior of the tool are just some of the avenues of research that can be  pursued.

Section   A:   Power   Circuitry  
Power is supplied to the HFCDT's electronics with an 18 VDC, 350 mA wall wart through an 8pin PREH  connector located on the tool cap.  The supply is fed to two parallel linear voltage regulators to obtain +10 VDC and +12 VDC supplies.  The  12 volt regulator supplies the two op amps (TLC072 and LF412).  The 10 volt regulator supplies the  HMC1501 position sensors.  The LM2937 requires an output bypass capacitor for stability.  A 10 µF tantalum chip capacitor with an  equivalent series resistance (ESR) < 3  was chosen.  In addition a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor was added to  the input side of the regulators (and also on the voltage supply side of each IC).   Other notable features of the LM2937 regulator are:   · · · · low voltage dropout  short circuit protection   reverse battery protection  thermal shutdown protection 

Section   B:   Position   Sensing  
The sensor chosen for position sensing was the Honeywell HMC1501.  This sensor has the following  beneficial features:  86   

· · · ·

Small size and low cost as compared to other noncontact measurement systems such as laser  Typical resolution of up to 0.002" for linear position sensing  Accuracy up to 0.1%  +/ 45o angular sensing range 

The sensor is comprised of four anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensing elements configured in a  Wheatstone bridge configuration (see Figure 2: AMR Bridge [2]).  An AMR material has an impedance  that varies with an applied magnetic field.  Specifically, it is dependent on the angle between the  direction of electric current and the orientation of the magnetic field.  The sensor operates in saturation mode, meaning that the sensor only responds to changes in the  orientation of the field and not the magnitude.  The minimum strength of the field to saturate the  sensor is 80 gauss, with no specified upper limit.    The maximum resistance of the sensing element occurs when the direction of the current is parallel to  the applied magnetic field. 

Signal   Output  
The HMC1501 contains one active sensing bridge.  The output of the bridge can be obtained from the  following equation:  V = Vs S sin(2 )  where  V is the differential output voltage        Vs is the bridge supply voltage  S is the material constant (12 mV/V)   is the reference to the magnetic field value (degrees) 

Taking the bridge supply voltage as 10V and a magnetic field value of +/ 45o provides a differential  output V = +/ 120 mV (biased at 5V).  Note:  The Wheatstone bridge performs as a rail splitter to create two near +5 volt sources that are  driven apart by V.  A differential amplifier is then used to amplify V to a more suitable level for analog  to digital conversion (ADC). 

87   

The 10 V bridge supply was chosen since most data acquisition systems have 010 volt ADCs.  A 5V or  3.3V supply would be more appropriate if the tool was to be made "smart" by embedding a  microcontroller.   

Section   C:   HMC1501   Signal   Conditioning  
The outputs of the HMC1501 are fed to an instrumentation amplifier.  An instrumentation amplifier is a  differential amplifier with buffered inputs; this eliminates the need for impedance matching of the  source and input electronics.  The instrumentation amplifier typically also offers very high common  mode rejection; the common noise on the inputs is greatly attenuated.  The instrumentation amplifier chosen for the signal conditioning of the HMC1501 outputs was the  TLC072 as recommended in the sensor's Application Note.  The TLC072 has dual amplifiers thus both  sensors can be fed into one unit.    The TLC072 has the following specifications (using a 12V supply):  · · · Gain Bandwidth Product = 10 MHz  Slew Rate = 16 V/µs  CMRR = 100 dB 

The HMC1501 sensors have a bandwidth of approximately 5 MHz.  This far supersedes the requirements  of the application.  The signal conditioning circuit was designed with a LP filter with a cutoff frequency of  about 100 Hz.  The bandwidth of the system can easily be increased by simply swapping out the  feedback capacitor in the TLC072's feedback loop.  The cutoff frequency fc is simply calculated as:  fc = (2RC) = [(2)(390 000)(4x109)]1 = 102.2 Hz  Since the valve used to actuate the HFCDT's actuator is only capable of 5 to 10 Hz, the 100 Hz bandwidth  of the sensors was considered to be more than adequate.  The amplifier gain is determined by the ratio of the external resistors as:  Ag = Rf/Ri = 390 000 / 10 000 = 39 or about 32 dB  Where   Rf is the feedback resistor and    Ri is the resistor to the op amp input.

The 39x amplification of the +/ 120 mV output from the HMC1501 sensors provides a full scale range of  almost 10 volts (0.32 V to 9.68 V) output to the data acquisition system.    The signal conditioning circuit also has the capability to perform offset trimming using a multiturn 1 k  trimpot.  This allows any offset voltages from sensor manufacturing, temperature effects, sensor  misalignment, or tool assembly to be compensated for.  The trimming circuit acts as a voltage divider  and biases the positive input on the op amp.  The 1 k resistors on the trimpot leads allow for greater  fine tuning by minimizing the adjustment range.  In this case the positive input can be biased between  3.33 and 6.67 volts.  This can be tightened further by replacing the 1 k resistors with 2 k resistors  (changing the bias range to between 4 and 6 volts).  The trimpots can be accessed by removing the 8pin  female PREH connector on the HFCDT cap and thus can be adjusted while the tool is powered using a  small screwdriver.  The 1 k resistors attached to the trim pot create a 5 volt bias using the voltage  divider principle.  The output signal must be biased so that positive and negative displacements can be  measured since the bridge and op amps are only powered by a single positive voltage supply. 

Section   D:   Axial   Displacement   Measurement  
The axial displacement of the tool bit is measured using the Celesco M150 cable extension position  transducer.    This sensor was primarily chosen because of its small size (the manufacturer claims it to be  the world's smallest stringpot) and ease of use.  The sensor provides an output signal proportional to the  input signal.  The sensor is supplied by the 12 V source.  The output of the sensor is sent to a JFET op  amp (LF412) which is configured in a voltage follower setup; again this is to simply eliminate loading  effects due to impedance mismatch.    No analog filtering circuitry was added due to the lack of space on the PCB; however, in future revisions  of the PCB, this could be added. 

Section   E:   PCB   Design  
A 4layer board was designed using the Express PCB board service.  A 4layer board provides greater  noise immunity and can be designed more compactly and efficiently since ground and power traces  don't have to be run to every component since the two inner board layers provide a power and ground  plane.

The board layers are copper and the laminate is FR4.  The total thickness of these boards is 0.067".  The  board thickness had to be accounted for in order to properly position the sensors to be inline with the  magnets mounted on the pivot rod.  Two circular boards were designed to stack and fit within the tool cap.  The PCBs are segregated by  function: 1) bottom PCB houses the sensors; and 2) the top PCB contains the signal conditioning and  power circuitry (see PCB board layout).  The bottom PCB has a circular cutout so that the PCB fits over  the top of the pivot rod bringing the sensors in line with the magnets.  Sections of the inner copper  layers were removed in the design so that when the cutout was performed there would be no chance of  bridging the ground and power planes resulting in a short; and also for when the aluminum pivot rod  comes in contact with the PCB.  After the centre hole was cut in the bottom PCB, the inner surface was  coated with MCoat A (an oil modified polyurethane) that would ensure that no copper planes were  exposed.  The centre cutout provided about a 0.125" clearance between the pivot rod and the edge of  the PCB.  This allows burr sizes of up to 20 mils (0.125/6... where 6 is the displacement amplification of  the pivot arm) to be detected.  Larger burr sizes can be accommodated by changing the top diameter of  the of the pivot rod.    The bottom PCB also constrains the top of the HFCDT actuator.  The PCBs are connected through a 20pin surface mount connector (DF40 series  0.4 mm contact pitch).   This type of connector is specifically designed for board to board connections.  Four aluminum standoffs  were also epoxied to the bottom PCB for board spacing and to allow for attachment to the top of the  HFCDT cap.  The PCB's were only fastened to the cap for easier assembly and maintenance or repair. The  bottom layer of the sensor PCB was left free from any electronic parts or other hardware (i.e. machine  screws) so that the inflatable actuator would not damage or be damaged (i.e punctured).  The side of the HFCDT has additional ports so that the exhaust from the actuator could be fed back into  the tool to cool down the electronics (if necessary).  An additional temperature sensor may be an  appropriate future consideration so that temperature offsets could be adjusted for (monitoring and  active cooling).    The HFCDT was made from a nonferrous metal in order to test the capability of the sensors.  The  magnets used are particularly strong (NdFeB rated at 10800 gauss) and it was thought that the magnets  could potentially magnetize the tool body and affect the sensor readings.  Making the tool from stainless  steel was considered, but the cost was prohibitive.  90
