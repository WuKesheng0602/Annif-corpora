ABSTRACT
COMBINED ANAEROBIC BAFFLED REACTOR AND UV/H202 PROCESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYNTHETIC SLAUGHTERHOUSE WASTEWATER WeihuaCao Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Manage·ment Ryerson University, Toronto, 2009

A laboratory scale for the combined processes of a biological anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) and a UV/hydrogen peroxide (H20 2) was used to investigate the treatment of a synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater with various influent concentrations and various hydraulic retention times (HRT) at room temperature in this study. The results showed that the removal efficiencies of total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 5-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) of the wastewater with an influent concentration of973 mgTOCIL and a HRT of3.8 days reached 89.9, 97.7, and 96.6%, respectively, in the ABR process, whilst the removal efficiency of TOC in the UV/H20 2 process reached 50.8% at a HRT of 3.6 hand a E 20 2 dosage of 1371 mgH20piL, leading to 95.0% of overall TOC removal of the combined processes. For comparison, the removal efficiencies of TOC, COD, and CBOD5 of the syAthetic wastewater with ·an influent concentration of 158 mgTOC/L reached 64.9, 81.9, and 84.3%, respectively, at a HRT of 2.5
h and a .H202 dosage of 13 71 mgH2 0piL in UV/H20 2 process alone. An optimum value of

hydrogen peroxide was found to be 3.5 (mgH20piL)/(mgTOCir/L.h).

iii

After the ABR treatment, the ratio of CBOD5/COD of the untreated wastewater changed from 0.4 to 0.6 and 0.5 to 0.2, and the ratio of coorroc of the wastewater decreased from 2.4 to 0.5 and 2.2 to 2.0, at the HRT of 3.8 and 0.9 days, respectively, indicating that the biodegradability of the wastewater was enhanced at a longer HRT in the ABR process. After the UV/H202 process treatment, the ratios of CBOD5/COD of the untreated and the ABR treated wastewater increased from 0.4 to 0.6 and 0.3 to 0.5, and the ratios of COD/TOC of the wastewaters decreased from 2.3 to 0.6 and 1.8 to 0.9, respectively, at the HRT of 2.5 h, indicating that the UV/H202 process had ability to enhance the biodegradability of the wastewater.

A kinetic model for the ABR process was obtained and used to evaluate the experimental findings. The parameters of the kinetic model for the ABR process were determined to be 3.1 x 1o-2 for refractory coefficient, 0.4 for kinetic coefficient, 2.0 mg/L for half-saturation constant for hydrolyzed substrate, and ·1.9 day- 1 for the maximum specific growth rate of organism, respectively.

The optimum HRT and the minimum total electricity cost were determined to be 78.9 h and $ll.45 /kg ofTOC removed for the ABR process, with 1000 mgTOCIL of the wastewater influent concentration, leading to 100.0 mgTOC/L of the effluent concentration which met the disposal level in Canada.

CHAPTER! INTRODUCTION

With the rapid development of various industries, the protection and preservation of natural resources has become a crucial challenge for sustainable environmental development of the whole society. Nowadays, wastewater treatment becomes one of the most significant issues. Although governments require wastewater discharge from industries to be controlled before releasing it to the environment, the treatment performance of industrial wastewater should be enhanced.

Wastewater treatment technologies including physical, chemical and biological methods are classified as three main categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments. They are widely used to remove contaminants from wastewater to achieve different levels of contaminant removal. It has been identified that screen, oil and grease removal units, dissolved air floatation, adsorption, stripping, coagulation, flow equalization, filtration, disinfection, biological treatment including any combination of aerobic lagoon, anaerobic lagoon, facultative lagoon, activated sludge -process, and/or other biological treatment processes are common wastewater treatment methods for industrial wastewater treatment (US EPA, 2002). Specially, biological treatment technologies have been frequently used to reduce biodegradable organic pollutants in municipal and industrial wastewater such as slaughterhouse wastewater.

Slaughterhouse wastewater is a typical organic wastewater and its amount has largely

risen in many countries due to the increase in water consumption in the processes of dairies, slaughterhouses and meat processing in order to meet the increasing demands of meat. The term "slaughterhouse" refers to abattoir and any place where cattle, sheep, swine, or other animals are killed for subsequent use as food for human consumption (NB. Reg. 88-200). Slaughterhouse wastewater may pollute receiving water resources due to its high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and suspended solids (SS), and may affect human health due to its high levels of pathogenic bacteria and parasites. Therefore, purifying slaughterhouse wastewater is a necessary task before releasing it to the
~eceiving

waters.

Many treatment technologies from

physica~

physico-chemical, and electrochemical to

biological technologies for slaughterhouse wastewater have been investigated. Previous research studies have pointed out the treatment ability of biological anaerobic treatment technologies for slaughterhouse wastewater but still there are some problems such as high concentration of organic matters and pathogens in the effluent of-the wastewater. ·

.In this study, a synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater was prepared as a model-sample to

conduct the experiments. A biological anaerobic treatment technology (anaerobic baffled reactor, ABR), an advanced oxidation process (UV/H202 process), and their combination were designed for the treatment of the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater.

OBJECTIVES

Combined processes of ABR and UV/H20 2 were investigated based on the advantages of ABR and UV/fh02 for the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater in this study. Therefore, the

2.1 SLAUGHTERHOUSE WASTEWATER

This section discussed-the general information on slaughterhouse wastewater including its characteristics and by-products, environmental impacts and health effects, and regulations and guidelines of its disposal. The treatment technologies for meat and poultry processing and some studies for the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater are summarized in this section.

2.1.1 Characteristics and By-products

Slaughterhouse wastewater is a typical industrial-wastewater with high levels of loading
in organics, inorganics and suspended solids (SS), including contents of lard, fats, proteins,

salt, nitrogen, phosphorous, pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses and bacteria, parasite eggs, urine, loose meat, grease, hair, feathers, flesh, manure, particles, grit, and undigested food (Bull et al., 1982; Jian and Zhang, 1999). Detergents and disinfectants, such as acid, alkaline, neutral compounds, disinfectants, and liquid paraffm, may enter the wastewater stream during facility-cleaning activities. It has been reported that the concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and suspended solid (SS) due to the presence of blood, tallow, and mucosa can reach to 151,000 to 200,000, 375,000, and 800 mg/L or higher, respectively (Haan eta/., 1996; Tritt and Schuchardt, 1992;
4

The Word Bank, 1998). The ranges of total COD, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and SS were within 2,333-8,627, 90-593, and 736-2,099 mg/L, respectively, for untreated wastewater from six hog slaughterhouses in Quebec and Ontario, Canada in 1995 and 1996 (Masse and
Mas~e,

2000a; Mittal, 2004). A potential pollutant load of 1,710,000 tons of BOD per year is produced by slaughterhouse industries just from the blood alone. This is equivalent to the organic pollutants from wastewater generated by 11,000,000 people (Al-Mutairi et al., 2003).

In some cases, offensive odors may occur (The Word Bank, 1998). The general
characteristics of slaughterhouse wastewater based on a survey in 1999 are shown in Table 2.1 (Nunez et al., 1999; UNEP!MAP, 2004).

Slaughterhouse wastes contain useful by-products (UNEP/MAP, 2004). For examples, slaughterhouse sludge containing crude protein, biogenic amines and ammonia, and essential amino acids has potential use for pig and poultry feeding (Gariepy et al., I 989; Hann et al. ,

5

1996; Fransen et al., 1995; Ponsano et al., 2003); and phosphorus in anaerobically di_gested poultry manure has been used as feed supplement for chicks without toxicity or negative effects (Shih, 1993).

Anaerobically digested slaughterhouse solids containing rich nutrients can be recycled and reused as an agricultural fertilizer (Salminen et al., 2001; Marchaim et al, 1991; Shih, 1993; Hann et al., 1996). The slurry of anaerobic digestion containing rich ammonia mineralized from organic nitrogen in slaughterhouse wastewater can be used on farmlands (Salminen and Rintala, 2002). Slaughterhouse wastewater can be used for irrigation and fish or algae production (Hann et al., 1996). The biogas generated by anaerobic digestion on-site as a by-product can be used as an energy source such as electricity, heating, or drying (Shih, 1993).

2.1.2 Environmental Impacts and Health Effects

Slaughterhouse industries discharge wastewater containing high concentration of organic er (Torkian et matter or toxic compounds, such as chromium, into surface and subsurface wat_
al., 2003; Verheijen et al., 1996). The main environmental impacts of slaughterhouse

wastewater discharge into surface water include a reduction of dissolved oxygen in theaquatic layer, eutrophication and oxygen depletion caused by nitrogen and phosphates. The discharge of slaughterhouse wastewater may also cause fish death in ponds, color and smell of water in canals, ditches and ponds, and rich organic matter and algae in lakes and reservoirs. All of these impacts will influence the water ecosystem and lead to a serious decline in water quality. The impacts of slaughterhouse wastewater discharge into the soil and underground water include the pollution of nitrate and chloric anion in underground

6

water, and the increase of biological pollution from many pathogenic microorganisms in cattle manur-e, which will persist in the soil forever and reproduce continuously. Consequently, soil and underground water used for drinking and irrigation can be seriously polluted (Fang, 2000).

The most significant environmental impact resulting from slaughtering activities is their wastes em-itted such as blood, manure, hair, fat, feathers, muscle, and bones, which may bring high concentrations of BOD, COD and total suspended solids (TSS) to slaughterhouse wastewater and is related to water consumption (UNEP/MAP, 2004). Large quantities of slaughterhouse wastewater are caused by large quantities of water consumption in slaughterhouse for evisceration, cleaning and washing operations. Slaughterhouse wastewater has been classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) as one of the most harmful wastewaters to the environment (Gariepy eta/., 1989).

In addition, pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and viruses generated by slaughtering

processes may contribute numerous hazards to human health (Salminen and Rintala, 2002). For instance, countries in Latin American have experienced serious gastrointestinal diseases, such as diarrhea, because of the presence of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminth eggs in slaughterhouse wastewater (Velasquez eta!., 2004). After studying the bacteriology, it was determined that the Ikpoba River in Nigeria contained a high heterotrophic bacterial load (6.0xi04 -7.0xl0 7 cfulmL) in 1993 due to a continual discharge of untreated slaughterhouse wastewater into the river (Benka-Coker and Ojior, 1995). The heterotrophic bacterial population in the river increased from 10 to 10 /mL after mixing with slaughterhouse wastewater. Six identified bacterial genera, Salmonella, Escherichia, Shigella, Klebsiella,
4

7

Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, were found in the river. Total coliforms and Escherichia

7

coli showed high counts of 1.6x 106-2.4x 106 /mL. The dissolved oxygen (DO) was dropped
from 7.2 to about 2.4 mg/L, while SS, BOD5, nitrate, and phosphate levels were increased appreciably.

The environmental impacts of slaughterhouse wastewater can be significantly reduced by simple technologies such as waste prevention and the use of by-products. For example, dry rendering of offal and cutting down on water consumption can reduce the amount of slaughterhouse wastewater produced. Collecting wastes as solids as far as possible can reduce contaminants concentrations in slaughterhouse wastewater. If the wastewater discharges without any treatment, it would have critical effects on the environment, and might easily lead to environmental pollution and human health risks (Fang, 2000; Polprasert et al., 1992; Nhat, 2006). Therefore, it is necessary for slaughterhouses industries to purify their wastewater before discharging it.

2.1.3 Regulations and Guidelines of Slaughterhouse Wastewater

Regulations and guidelines are essential components in dealing with the environmental impact of slaughterhouse industries. Their roles are to limit or prohibit the use of chromium in tanneries, control the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in chilling processes, limit the total BOD output in wastewater, and prescribe odor and gaseous emission control (Haan et al.,

1996). If ~astewater contains nitrogen contents and nitrification is inhibited during BOD
testing, 5-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5),
whi~h

is equivalent to

BOD, will be reported in place of BOD (APHA et a/., 1998). The standard levels recommended for slaughterhouse wastewater discharge in Canada are shown in Table 2.2. The effluent guidelines and maximum levels for meat processing which are indicative of

8

good international industry practice are shown in Table 2.3. These levels should be achieved without dilution during at least 95% of the plant or unit operation time. Furthermore, these levels are applicable for direct discharge of treated effluents to surface water for general use (IFC, 2007). Under a well designed, well operated and well maintained pollution prevention and control system, the effluent concentration from slaughterhouse processing could be reduced to achieve the guideline levels.

2.1.4 Research Studies on Slaughterhouse Wastewater

Table 2.4 summanzes the treatment technologies for slaughterhouse wastewater that have been successfully designed to deal with the health effects and environmental impacts caused by slaughterhouse wastewater.

Physical treatment technologies have been investigated to treat slaughterhouse wastewater. It was reported by Masse and Masse (2000a) that sewer discharge without preliminary treatment was used mostly by smaller slaughterhouses located- near municipal wastewater treatment plants. The slaughterhouse wastewater was diluted by domestic wastewater leading to a much lower BOD and inorganic nutrient concentration and, thus, became more amenable to biological treatment. Masse and Masse (2000a) and Bull et al. (1982) identified that the land application was very simple, with low costs for slaughterhouse wastewater and.had been mainly used by spray irrigation in the USA. Constructed wetlands

combined with anaerobic lagoons had been applied to treat slaughterhouse wastewater with 91% BODs removal, 89% COD removal, 85% TSS removal, 80%. organic nitrogen removal, and effective removal of pathogens and Coliform (Gutierrez-Sarabia- et al., 2004). However, 60% phosphorus was stored in sediments using wetland treatment (White et al., 2000).

Physico-chemical treatment technologies have been studied by many investigators for slaughterhouse wastewater treatment. It was reported by Viraraghaven (1988) that peat filtration could remove 66, 65, 94, and 87% BOD, COD, SS, and P, respectively. Ozone's ability to significantly reduce BOD, COD, and TOC in slaughterhouse wastewater was observed by Millamena (1992). Ozone's effectiveness in disinfecting slaughterhouse wastewater was found by Wu and Doan (2005). Dissolved air flotation (DAF) was able to remove large amounts of nutrients with low capital cost (Masse and Masse,. 2000a; Johns, 1995). Coagulation combined with flocculation could effectively reduce organi-e matter (Sanchis et al., 2003; Nunez et al., 1999). The process ofDAF-coagulation-flocculation-DAF was used to achieve a high SS removal with good clarification (Al-Mutairi et al., 2004).

Electrochemical treatment technologies have been also studied. It was found by Kobya et

al. (2006) and Bayramoglu et al. (2006) that electrocoagulation could achieve 93% COD
removal by using aluminum electrode and 98% oil and grease removal through iron electrode. Manaila et al. (2005) observed that polyelectrolytes were very effective and inexpensive to reduce COD, TSS, and, fat matter. Electrolytes were found to be able to ·change 100% sulphide. into insoluble precipitates and remove more than 70% COD (Marconato et al., 1998).

Biological treatment is one of the most reliable processes to treat slaughterhouse

12

wastewater under anaerobic or aerobic · conditions to remove COD, BOD and other contaminants. In aerobic digestion, microorganisms degrade organics in the presence of oxygen, while the system generates large quantities of biological sludge (Masse and Masse, 2000a; Rudd, 1985). Aerobic treatment processes are limited by their high energy consumption needed for aeration and high sludge production (Kobya, M.; et a/. 2006). Anaerobic systems have been demonstrated to be the most suitable wastewater treatment systems for slaughterhouse wastewater (Sayed eta/., 1987; Borja eta/., 1998; Rajeshwari et a/., 2000; Torkian eta/., 2003). During anaerobic digestion, organics are degraded by various bacteria into methane and carbon dioxide in the absence of oxygen (Tritt et a/., 1992). Table 2.5 summarizes the processes that have been used for the biological treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater.

2.2 ANAEROBIC DIGESTION

Anaerobic digestion is defined as "the biological oxidation of degradable organic sludge by microbes under anaerobic conditions" (Reynolds and Richard, 1996). Anaerobic digestion processes of various configurations have been studied for the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater. Simple anaerobic systems could reduce BOD by half,
whil~

sophisticated

anaerobic systems could reduce BOD by 90% or more (Hann et a/., 1996). The reduction of soluble and insoluble COD can also reach to a high efficiency with a low production of sludge (only 5 to 20% of that generated by an aerobic system). Anaerobic systems do not require aeration energy and chemical handling to reduce BOD and COD at a high efficiency, and they employ microbes to reduce organic matter in wastewater. In t"Yl!' anaerobic digestion process, about 70% of all the methane produced converts from acetate which comes from volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (McCarty and Mosey, 1991).

2.2.1 Kinetics of Anaerobic Digestion

Conceptually, the growth of microbe can be designated as four different phases (Reynolds and Richard, 1996): lag phase, exponential or log growth phase, stationary phase, and death phase as shown in Figure 2.1. Microbes are employed by anaerobic technologies to digest organic matter in the water and wastewater where there is no molecular oxygen. During anaerobic digestion, the microbes convert organic compounds into oxidized substances, new _cells, energy for their life processes, and some gaseous end products such as methane and carbon dioxide (Reynolds and Richard, 1996). Reaction (2.1) is generalized for the anaerobic digestion process.

The process of anaerobic digeStion is accomplished by two groups of microorganisms, organic-acid-forming heterotrophs and methane-producing heterotrophs (Reynolds and ruchard, 1996). The complex organic matter such as carbohydrates (sugars, starches, and cellulose or plant fiber), protei-ns, and their degradation products are used by the organic-acid-forming heterotrophs to form the products, organic acids named volatile fatty acids (VFA), which are used by the methane-producing heterotrophs to produce methane and carbon dioxide. The breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins in anaerobic conditions are shown in Reactions (2.2) and (2.3). The pathway for methane production from com-plex organic matter is shown in Figure 2.2. Methane producers grow more slowly than acid formers and require pH range of about 6.7 to 7.4.

Conceptually, nitrogen removal by biological processes requires the nitrogen to be in the form of nitrate (N0 3) (Reynolds and ruchard, 1996). Aerobic biochemical reaction, called
20

nitrification converts carbonaceous and · organic nitrogen matter to ammonia (NH3) or ammonium ion (NH/), then to nitrite (N02-), and finally to N03-. Another biochemical reaction, called denitrification converts N03- to nitrogen gas (N2). The biochemical reactions for nitrification and denitrification are shown in Reactions (2.4) and (2.5), respectively (Reynolds and Richards, 1996).

Organic matter in slaughterhouse wastewater could be represented by total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (1N) due to multiple organic compounds in the wastewater. Therefore, TOC and 1N are firstly used by organic-acid-forming heterotrophs to produce VFAs and gaseous ammonia, and then VFAs are used by methane-producing heterotrophs to produce methane and carbon dioxide.

The relationship between the growth rate constant and the substrate concentration was given by Monod kinetics of anaerobic digestion developed in 1940s, and was developed from the young populations of microorganisms with rapid growth rate under the condition of an abundant substrate and applied to a single strain of bacteria growing on a single rate-limiting substrate (McCarty and Mosey, 1991 ). The Monod kinetic equation is sho\\rn- in Equation (2.6) (Reynolds and Richards, 1996).

where f1 is specific growth rate of microorganisms, day-1 ; flm is the maximum specific growth rate of microorganisms, day- 1; Kc is the substrate concentration when the growth rate constant is half of the maximum rate constant, giL; and Sis substrate concentration, giL.

21

Monod' s original equation was derived from observation of young populations of microorganisms which grew very quickly in the presence of abundance of food supply · (McCarty and Mosey, 1991). However, elderly populations of microorganisms were employed in many wastewater fermentations and grew slowly in semi-starvation conditions where a large prQportion of substrate's energy is used by the microorganisms simply to stay alive. Therefore, the concept of "maintenance energy" whereby only the surplus substrate was available for microorganisms' growth was introduced by Pirt (1975) as shown in Equation (2. 7).

where:

(2.7)

dX/dt is the rate of microorganism growth, giL. day; dS/dt is the rate of substrate utilization, giL. day;
X is the concentration of microorganisms, giL;

·

m is maintenance constant, day- 1; and .

·

Y (dimensionless) is the yield coefficient and simply states that the growth rate of
microorganisms is directly proportional to the rate of substrate utilization.

An almost similar model to Equation (2.7), which was derived from the fact that microorganisms could die of starvation or of old age, is presented in Equation (2.8) and is used for continuous culture growth under anaerobic conditions (McCarty, 1966; McCarty, 1991). Equations (2.7) and (2.8) differ only according to whether one believes the starving microorganisams are getting fewer, but they are indistinguishable mathematically (McCarty, 1991). Therefore, they tend to be used interchangeably. Combining Equation (2.8) and Michaelis-Menten Equation (2.9), Equation (2.10) is presented by McCarty (1966) to express

22

the relationship between the growth rate of microorganisms and the concentration of the substrate. (2.8)

A kinetic model for bacterial growth with continuous cultures in mineral salts media containing ammonium as a nitrogen source and glucose as a carbon source was developed by Contois (1959) based on the Monod kinetic model. The results indicated that the specific growth rate of bacteria was a function of population density and the concentration of limiting substrate. The Contois equation is shown in Equation (2.11).

A kinetic model for microorganism and methane produced in a magnetically stirred batch anaerobic digestion process was introduced by Fiestas et al. (1990). Methane production agreed with the first order kinetics as shown in Equation (2.12). The parameters Gm and
Kobs

can be determined numerically from experiment by using the international Time Series Processor (TSP) computer program version 4.0 D (Stanford, CA, USA), which is a complete language for the estimation and simulation of econometric models. The calculation must be made under loading density smaller than 9.6 gCOD/L to avoid an inapplicable model. (2.12) where:

·

Gm is maximum methane volume, L, which is accumulated at an infinite digestion
time;

A batch and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was investigated for the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater by Rodriguez-Martinez et al. (2002). It was demonstrated that the reactions in the UASB system agreed with the frrst order kinetics model for the production of methane and molecular nitrogen (N2).

24

A kinetic model for the anaerobic digestion of organic substrates was developed by Barthakur et a/. (1991) based on three stages of anaerobic digestion: (1) extracellular hydrolysis of complex compounds into soluble assimilable substrates, (2) transportation of assimilable substrates into microorganisms, and (3) utilization of assimilable substrates for microorganisms growth and generation of products. At the first stage, hydrolysis was assumed to be a first-order reaction as shown in Equation (2.13). At the second stage, the transportation of soluble substrates into microorganisms was assumed to the difference in theconcentrations of the soluble substrate outside and inside the microorganisms and to the active biomass as shown in Equation (2.14). The growth of microorganisms was assumed to follow Monod Equation (2.6) as shown in Equation (2.15).

Assuming maintenance energy and microbial decay were small so that biomass yield coefficient Y is constant. Therefore, substituting X = Yb(S0-S) into Equation (2.14) and combining Equations (2.13) and (2.15), a basic equation, Equation (2.16), for substrate utilization in the anaerobic digestion of complex organic compounds was given: Jlm = KsKh + khKsYb (S0 J1 KhS where:

For complex organic substrates, a part of substrates is refractory to biodegradation. The refractory coefficient R is expressed asR= S, , where Sr and Sro are the refractory and total STO substrate concentration in the influent. Therefore, the two relationships, So=Sro(1-R) and
S=Sr-RSro are given, where ST is the total substrate concentration in the effluent. Substituting

them into Equation (2.16), the basic Equation (2.17) for substrate utilization in anaerobic digestion is given as follows. Under _ steady-state conditions of continuous digestion in a completely mixed reactor without recycle, p equals the reciprocal of hydraulic retention time
t. Therefore, Equation (2.17) reduces to Equation (2.18), which had been used for

semicontinuous (Barthakur et al., 1991) and continuous (Setiadi et a/., 1996) anaerobic digestion. In this model, hydrolyzed products were considered as limiting substrates for microorganisms' growth and product formation. It was demonstrated by Barthakur et al. (1991) that poor and rate-limiting substrate hydrolysis and no hydrolysis of substrate took the form of Contois and Monod equations, respectively.

A first order model to describe the substrate concentration driving force within each compartment of anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) in a continuous system was proposed by Kennedy and Barriault (2007). This model assumed that (1) the soluble component in an n-compartment ABR as a whole was the representative of n-CSTR-in-series, (2) the system would act as one large CSTR where the recycle was high compared to the influent flow, and (3) aceticlastic methane production was the rate-limiting step. The first order rate constant could be calculated from operational treatment data knowing the substrate concentrations and biomass in each compartment. The mass balance in the first compartment and the compartment of an n-compartment-ABR are presented in Equations (2.19) and (2.20). (2.19)

(2.20) For steady-state conditions, dS1/dt and dS;Idt = 0, then Equations (2.19) and (2.20) reduce to Equations (2.21) and (2.22), respectively, which are used to estimate the values of the first order rate coefficient of each compartment. In case of no recycle, rr = 0, Equations (2.21) and (2.22) reduce to Equation (2.23). (2.21)

2.2.2 Parameters of Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment

2.2.2.1 Organic Loading Rate

Organic loading rate (OLR) is a significant parameter on microbial ecology, especially in anaerobic wastewater treatment such as UASB system (Torkian eta/., 2003; Rajeshwari eta/., 2000). High OLRs containing suspended and colloidal components in the form of fats, proteins, and cellulose can have an adverse impact on the performance of UASB reactors, and therefore lead to the deterioration of microbial activity and active biomass washout (Lettinga

eta/., 1997; Nunez and Mart'mez, 1999). Limited operational OLRs of 4-6 gCODI(L.d) was
demonstrated by Lettinga and Hulshoff Pol (1991). The OLRs of 5 gCODI(L.d) with 90% COD removal at 37°C was reported by Ruiz eta/. (1997). Up to 5 gCODI(L.d) OLRs at 30°C was reported by both Sayed et a/. (1987) and Sayed and De Zeeuw ( 1988). The OLRs of 12-17 gCODI(L.d) with 65-99% COD removal was reported by Borja and Banks (1994). Up to the OLRs of 31 gBODI(L.d) with 95% BODs removal at 25-39°C without loss of stability was demonstrated by Chavez et a/. (2005). An anaerobic fluidized bed reactor can withstand
29

a higher OLR with better stability, while achieving high COD reduction at a short hydraulic retention time of 0.2-5 days (Rajeshwari et al., 2000). The typical COD loading rates and HRT for various anaerobic reactors are given in Table 2.6. As shown in this table, the COD loading rates in the UASB is higher than those in this study due to the granular sludge in the UASB reactor as compared to the flocculent sludge in the ABR.

HRT(day)

10-60 12-15 0.5-7 0.5-12 0.2-5 0.2-5 0.9-3.8

2.2.2.2 Nutrients

Another important parameter in anaerobic digestion is nutrients. The presence of ions in feed can affect anaerobic digestion because ions can influence the granulation process and stability of reactors (Rajeshwari et al., 2000). The bacteria in anaerobic digestion require nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous for their optimum growth. The lack of these nutrients will bring an adverse effect upon microbial growth and performance even though at only extremely low concentrations. The required optimum C:N:P ratio of 100:2.5:0.5 for enhanced yield of methane was reported by Somayaji (1992). To make sure small excess amount of the nutrients are available, the wastewater has to be supplemented with the
30

nutrients prior to treatment (Hulsho Pol, 1995).

However, higher concentration of nitrogen in the effluent of wastewater is undesirable because ammonia-nitrogen is toxic to fish and will be bio-oxidized by nitrifying microorganisms to form nitrates using molecular oxygen in the receiving water body, and nitrate-nitrogen are nutrients that stimulate algal and aquatic growths (Reynolds and Richard, 1996). As shown in Table 2.1 , the general concentration of total nitrogen (TN) in the synthetic wastewater was largely higher than the disposal lever in Canada shown in Table 2.2 and 2.3. Therefore, it is important to study the changes of TN in a wastewater treatment system.

2.2.2.3 Temperature and pH

Anaerobic digestion is classified as three main categories, psychrophilic (0-20°C), mesophilic (20-43°C), and thermophilic (43-75°C) (Hulsho Pol, 1995). Temperature is another strong parameter in anaerobic digestion. The lower the temperature is, the longer the digestion time is (Rajeshwari et a/., 2000). The temperature of s-laughterhouse wastewater is typically between 20 and 36°C (Masse and Masse, 2001 )._The very low decay rate at the temperatures below 15°C is an important characteristic of anaerobic bacteria (Rajeshwari et
a/., 2000). The removal efficiencies of COD decrease to 92, 85, and 78% along with .the

temperatures of 31, 21 , and 12.5°C, respectively, in the stationary phase (Del Pozo et a/., 2006).

The pH is also an important parameter which anaerobic reactions are highly dependent on (Rajeshwari et a!., 2000). The optimum pH range for methane producing bacteria is

31

6.8-7.2 while acid-forming bacteria desire a lower pH (Mudrak and Kunst, 1986). In order to prevent the predominance of .acid-forming bacteria which may cause the accumulation of volatile fatty acids, the pH of anaerobic digestion is typically maintained between methanogenic limits. Sodium bicarbonate is generally used as a buffer solution to supplement alkalinity for neutralizing any eventual VFA accumulation (Hulsho Pol, 1995).

2.2.3_ Anaerobic Baffled Reactor fABR)

Anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) is a high-rate reactor that commonly contains 3 to 8 compartments in which liquid flow is alternately upwards and downwards between compartments (Barber and Stuchey, 1999). The more compartments an ABR has, the longer the hydraulic retention time is in the ABR, which further leads to a higher removal efficiency and higher capital, opemtion -and maintenance costs. Several commonly used ABRs are
pres~nte_cLin

Figure 2.3. Their comparison is shown in Table 2.7. ABR could be considered

consisting of n-upflow-reacters connected by baffles, and had been suggested to have a promise for industrial wastewater treatment (Bachmann et al., 1985; Grobicki and Stuckey, 1991; Boopathy et al., 1988). Each-compartment may be designed to have similar-or different working volume corresponding to similar or different residence time of wastewater, respectively. The residence-time of an ABR depends on its wastewater flowrate and total working volume, which is the total working volume by the wastewater flowrate. Therefore, different configurations with similar total working volume may have different residence times. For each compartment of ann-compartment ABR with similar working volume, its residence time equals
__!_

n

of the total residence time. Currently, ABR has been frequently used and

presented its promise for wastewater treatment as shown in Table 2.8.

ABR is effective for wastewater treatment under- a wide range of flowrates and loadings.
It has higher resilience to hydraulic and-organic shock loads, longer biomass retention time,

and lower sludge yields than many other high rate anaerobic reactors such as USAB EBarber and Stuckey, 1999). Also, ABR has the ability to separate acidogenesis and methanogenesis longitudinally down the reactor leading to a two-phase (volatile and non-volatile components) system and various bacteria groups in each phase (Foxon et al., 2004; Bell and Buckley, 2003; Kennedy and Barriault, 2007; Hutoan et al., 1999). The design
and~

operation of ABR are

very simple with low capital and operating cost (Barber and Stuckey, 1999). Mechanical mixing and maintenance during normal operation are not required (Foxon et al., 2004). The main disadvantage of ABR is that it is not able to produce a floating sludge layer. In addition, the higher velocity of wastewater associated with the baffles could cause the solid washout.

Advanced oxidation process (AOP) is an oxidative method based on highly reactive radicals and holds the greatest promise to degrade organic compounds in water and wastewater and detoxify water and wastewater through generation of hydroxyl radicals, ·oH, which are powerful species for water and wastewater treatment and has an extreme effect on reducing organic compounds (Bolduc and Anderson, 1997; Zhou and Smith, 2002; Legrini et

a/., 1993; Glaze, 1987; Varatharajan and Kanmani, 2007). The advantages of AOPs include
high removal rate, large range of applicability, thorough mineralization of pollutants in water and wastewater, and changing nonbiodegradable, recalcitrant, and refractory compounds into more biodegradable components as well as a high reaction rate (Stefan et al. 1996; De Morais and Zamora, 2005; Aye et al., 2004). In comparison to the conventional biological treatment, an important disadvantage of AOPs is their high capital and operating costs (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). The main AOPs include ozonation, ozone (03)/hydrogen peroxide (H2<h) process, ultraviolet light (UV)/H20 2 process, UV/03, UV/H202/03, Fenton/U\l/H202 process, UV/Ti02 process, vacuum UV process, and some others (Legrini et al., 1993; Zhou and Smith, 2002). Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) may be also applied as final treatment technique after biological units before wastewater discharge, which should reduce COD to satisfy local regulations on discharge (Raj and Quen, 2005).

The lJV/H20 2 is one of the most appropriate AOP processes that has been frequently used as an effective technique for various wastewater treatments recently. For example, a photocatalytic system under the presence of l.JV radiation for the treatment of a textile dye (reactive yellow 2) wastewater was investigated, and the results showed that both decolorization and mineralization were significantly improved by using optimum H20 2

38

concentration of 15 mM, and followed the first order kinetics (Aye et a/., 2003). The treatment of atrazine in water using a UV/H20 2 process was investigated by Beltran et a/ (1993) and they reported more than 99% of atrazine degradation in less than IS minutes. The decolorization and mineralization of cotton dyeing effluent containing C.L Direct Blue 199 through a UV/H20 2 were also studied by Shu (2006) and the results showed that the color was removed very quickly and TOC removal was reached about 75 and 80% in 30 and 120 minutes, respectively. The treatment of raw surface water containing disinfection byproducts (DBPs) using a UV/H20 2 process with UV dosage of0-3,500 mJ/cm2 and H2 0 2 concentration of 0-23 mg/L was studied and the results showed that the UV/H20 2 process was effective in reducing DBPs at UV dosage of more than 1,000 mJ/cm2 and initial H20 2 concentrations of about or greater than 23 mg/L (Toor and Mohseni, 2007). The degradation of a 100 mg/L solution of linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS) by using a UV/H20 2 process with the wavelength of 254 nm was investigated by Venhuis and Mehrvar (2005) and an optimum H20 2 concentration of 5000 mg/L was reported based on the first order kinetics. Another optimum H20 2 concentration of 720 mg/L for the degradation of a LOO mg/L solution of LAS in a pilot-plant photoreactor with the wavelength of 254 nm was reported by Tabrizi and Mehrvar (2006).

The mechanism most commonly accepted for the photolysis of H20 2 is the cleavage of one H2 0 2 molecule into two hydroxyl radicals COH) per quantum of radiation absorbed, which is shown in Reaction (2.26) (Legrini et al, 1993; Esplugas et al., 2002; Crittenden et al, 1999; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). When an organic compound (RH) presented in water and wastewater, the reactions between generated hydroxyl radicals and organic pollutants may be differentiated by the mechanisms of Reactions (2.26) to (2.36). The major reactions including literature values of relevant quantum yields or rate constants for organic compounds (RH)

39

involved in a UV/H20z process are summarized in Table 2.9 (Legrini et al, 1993; Crittenden

et al, 1999; Johnson and Mehrvar, 2008).

A number of advantages in water and wastewater treatment are presented by UVIH202 process, such as offering great potentials in wastewater treatment especially disinfection, enhancing the degradation of pollutants, accelerating the rate of oxidation of wastewater, reducing the concentration of pollutions, thermal stability and storage on-site, high solubility of H20 2 in water, no mass transfer problems related to gases, applicability for most organic substrates, and simple operation procedure (Toor and Mohseni, 2007; Sonntag et al, 1993; Raj and Quen, 2005; Legirini et al, 1993). Certainly, there are also limitations of the application of UV/H20 2 process. For example, the rate of the formation of hydroxyl radicals limits the rate of the chemical oxidation of pollutants (Legirini et al, 1993). At higher concentrations, H20 2 acts as a strong scavenger for hydroxyl radical which can reduce the degradation of organics (Glaze et al., 1987; Stefan et al., 1996). Also, the presence of carbonate and. bicarbonate ions has been observed as hydroxyl radical scavengers, which could slow down the degradation rate of some organic matters (Mehrvar et al., 2001 ).

2.4 IS THERE ANY NEED FOR COMBINED TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF SLAUGHTERHOUSE WASTEWATER?

An overview of slaughterhouse wastewater treatment and its characteristics, by-products,

environmental impacts, and health effects was provided in this chapter. The studies on the treatment technologies of slaughterhouse wastewater, anaerobic digestion and UV/H2 0 2 process were also reviewed in this chapter. After examining most previous studies, it was found that the general characteristics of the effluent from slaughterhouse wastewater in most of processes still had significant concentrations of COD, BOD5, nitrogen, and pathogen and

44

could not meet the recommended disposal level in Canada even if they presented high removal efficiencies. Meanwhile, the .remaining processes had lower removal efficiencies of the COD, BOD5, and nitrogen. Therefore, a new combined technology is needed to treat slaughterhouse wastewater sufficiently before the effluent is discharged into receiving waters.

Many investigators studied combined processes of biological process and UV/H202 for wastewater treatment. An integrated system of UV/H20 2 process and activated sludge bioreactor was investigated and presented a cost-effective process for aqueous degradation of phenol (Edalatmanesh et a/., 2008). A combined system of photochemical and biological processes was studied to treat linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) in water (Mehrvar and Tabrizi, 2006) and the results showed that the biodegradability of the untreated LAS solution with the lower effluent concentration (10 mg/L) in a photoreactor was higher than that of biological pretreated LAS soluti-on with the same effluent concentration in the photoreactor due to the presence of some intermediates.

The advantages of combined system of biological and AOP processes include (Lee et a/., 2001; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004): · flexibility of total residence time to bring a constant efficiency for chemical and biological reactor; · · decreasing in chemical cost through cost-effective biological pretreatment; and achieving total mineralization for organic compounds by minimizing total cost.

2.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

After examining different processes for the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater, a

45

combined anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) and UV/H2 ~ was selected for the treatment of synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater in this study. Due to the biodegradability of the synthetic wastewater, the ABR was placed before the UV photoreactor which was used as the fmal treatment technology.

The model Equations (2.17) and (2.18) proposed by Barthakur et al. (1991) was investigated to evaluate the performance of the ABR process. The objectives of this study are mentioned in Chapter 1.

CHAPTER3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND METHODOLOGY

3.1 MATERIALS

A synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater employed in this study was prepared based on the study of Stephenson and Lester (1985). It contained (mg/L distilled water): commercial meat extract powder (Oxoid Lab Lemco L0029, Oxoid Ltd.), 1950; glycerol (C 3H80 3), 200; ammonium chloride (N&Cl), 360; sodium chloride (NaCl), 50; potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH2P04), 30; calcium chloride (CaCh), 24; and magnesium sulfate (MgS04·7H20), 7.5. According to the information from the manufacturer, Oxoid Ltd., the commercial meat extract contained 17 amino acids including alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, praline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. Twenty, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of the amount of each component in the synthetic wastewater were used respectively to prepare various levels of the synthetic wastewater.

The analysis of the meat extract provided by the manufacturer, Oxoid Ltd. (Nepean, Ontario, Canada), gave 13.3% w of total nitrogen (TN)/w of meat extract and a pH of 7.2 ± 0.2. The TN of the meat extract based on the above 17 amino acids was calculated to be 10.9% w of TN/w of meat extract as shown in Table A.1 in Appendix A. The difference between these two values of TN indicates that there would be unknown organic compounds in the meat extract.
47

To investigate the characteristics of the synthetic wastewater, the pH value and the concentrations of TOC, TN, COD, and CBOD5 were measured. The results compared with literature values are sbown in Table 3.1. The results showed that the literature values of COD is greater than that in this study due to the operating error of weighing each components and system error of top-loading balance. The TOC of the meat extract based on the above 17 amino acids was calculated to be 31.5% w of TOC/w of meat extract as shown in Table A.1 in Appendix A. Considering the amounts of glycerol and ammonium chloride used in the initial synthetic wastewater, the TOC and TN concentrations were calculated to be 692 mgC/L and 354 mgN/L (determined by 13.3% w ofTN/w of meat extract). It shows that there was a big difference between the TOC measurement (950-980 mgC/L) and the estimated value (692

mgC/L) due to unknown organic compounds in the meat extract. The calculations ofTOC and
TN concentrations of the initial synthetic wastewater are shown in Appendix A.

Ratios of TOC, COD, and BOD5 can be used to assist in characterizing a waste (Metcalf and Eddy, 1993; Eckenfelder, 2000). The ratio of COD!fOC gives an indication of the
48

average state of carbon in a solution. BOD depends on the biodegradability of a waste. The ratio of BOD/COD (commonly BODs/COD) gives an indication of the biodegradability of the waste. The ratio of COD/TOC ranges from 0 to 5.33 for methane when an organic matter is resistant to dichromate oxidation, and the ratio of BODs/COD of a readily biodegradable waste is 0.5 or greater. If wastewater contains nitrogen contents and nitrification is inhibited during BODs testing, 5-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBODs) will be used to replace BODs (APHA eta/., 1998). In this study, the ratio of CBODs/COD of the undiluted synthetic wastewater was about 0.4-0.5, which indicates that the synthetic wastewater was biodegradable, and the ratio of COD!fOC of the undiluted wastewater was about 2.2-2.4. After mixing with H202 solution, this ratio of CBODs/COD of the undiluted synthetic wastewater decreased to 0.3-0.4, which indicated that the biodegradability of the synthetic wastewater was decreased by H 20 2 solution.

Anaerobic sludge.was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Toronto, Ontario and was loaded manually into the anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR). The redundant sludge was stored in a closed container and was fed by the synthetic wastewater periodica11y at room temperature for possible use in the future. The suspended solid concentration of the anaerobic sludge was 20,000 mg/L.

A hydrogen peroxide solution (Ill 0 giL of density) containing 30% w/w of H20 2 (EMD Chemicals, Inc.) was used in UV/H202 process. The concentration of H20 2 in the wastewater was determined as follows.

3.2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The schematic diagram of the combined processes of the ABR and the UV/lh02 is shown in Figure 3.1. Although wastewater recycle could reduce the influent concentration and further decrease HRT and operation cost of a process, recycle stream was not used for the combined processes in this study due to the consideration of total capital costs and experimental time. The ABR with individual gas headspace was designed based on the previous studies summarized in Table 2. 7 which shows that the ratios of length to width (L/W), width to height (WIH), and length to height (LIH) of those ABRs are 1.2-3.3, 0.2-0.8, and 0.4-2.5, respectively. Due to the consideration of wastewater retention time, removal efficiency of wastewater, and total costs, the ABR was designed to contain 5 equal-volume compartments with dimensions of 50 em in length, 15 em in width, and 50 em in height, which gave the ratios 0.3, 0.3, and 1.0 ofL/W, W/H, and L/H, respectively, indicating that the design of the ABR could be reliable for the synthetic wastewater. In order to mix the wastewater, each compartment was further divided into 2 small compartments with 2 and 8em width, respectively, by a 45° slanted edge baffle (6), leading to the downflow and upflow

of the wastewater passing through anaerobic sludge layer in each compartment. The total volume of the ABR was 37.5 L with a total working volume of33.7 L.

The synthetic wastewater homogenized by a recirculating pump ( 18) at room temperature was fed continuously from a wastewater feed tank ( 1) into the ABR (5) by a peristaltic pump (2) and flowed downwards and upwards within 5 compartments. Each compartment had an anaerobic sludge layer (9). The flowrate of the wastewater was measured by a acrylic flow meter (3) (FL-2018, .0mega) connected to a peristaltic injector pump with 115V60Hz and 80 Watts (Flexflo A-IOOE, Blue-White Industries Ltd). The wastewater samples of each compartment were taken by gravity from wastewater sampling valves (8) located 40 em from the bottom of each compartment and 4 em from the side of its slanted edge baffle. The sludge samples of each compartment were taken by gravity from sludge sampling valves (7) located 10 em from the bottom of each compartment and 4 em from the side of its slanted edge baffle. The ABR-treated wastewater discharged into a treated wastewater collection tank (14) in the ABR process or flowed into a UV photoreactor (12), which was controlled by different valves (4, 10, 11 ), then discharged into the treated wastewater collection tank in the combined processes. In the combined processes, the relationship of the hydraulic retention time between ABR reactor and photoreactor is expressed by Equation (3.2) when the flowrate of H 20 2 (lower than 10% of the wastewater flowrates) was negligible.

A UV photoreactor (Siemens, SL-LAB-.5) with a total working volume of 1.35 L with 8
em external diameter and 34 em total length was connected to the ABR. A UV lamp (13) with
5,2

output power of 6 W, and 2.5 em in diameter covered by a quartz sleeve was inserted into the center of the cylindrical UV photoreactor. The wavelength of UV light was 254 nm. In the combined processes, diluted H202 solutions were continuously added into the UV photoreactor by gravity from a H202 solution container (15), and its flowrate was controlled by a valve (16) to be as slow as possible not to affect the wastewater concentration and was measured manually. In the UVIH202 process alone, the wastewater mixed with H20 2 continuously fed to the UV photoreactor by gravity from the same H20 2 solution container (15). The flowrate was also controlled by valve (16) and was measured by hand.

Biogas produced in each compartments of the AB·R was collected by a gas collection container (17) filled with water, and its total volume was determined by the volume of the water displaced from the gas collection container.

3.3 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

3.3.1 Acclimatization of Anaerobic Sludge in the ABR

First the ABR was filled with 10 L of fresh anaerobic sludge, with 2 L in each compartment (about 30% of the working volume of each compartment). After sealing the ABR, in order for the microorganisms to gradually adapt to the synthetic wastewater, the anaerobic sludge was acclimatized first. by running the ABR continuously at a constant flowrate of 8.8 mL/min by gradually increasing in the synthetic wastewater concentration entering the ABR from 20, 40, 60, and 80 to 100% of the undiluted ·synthetic wastewater. Twenty, 40, and 60o/o levels remained for 14 days, while 80% level remained for 10 days. A
lOOo/o level was set at day 53 and remained for 15 days. From day 69, the VSS of the

anaerobic sludge was observed to reach a high level and looked like to fall .in the stationary
53

phase of the bacterial growth curve (see Figures 2.1 and 4.5). Therefore, the anaerobic sludge was considered ready for the future experiments on the undiluted synthetic wastewater, and all experiments were in actual experiment.

Samples of anaerobic sludge in each compartment were taken during the acclimatization to measure their total suspended solid (TSS) and volatile suspended solid (VSS) concentrations. The trend of VSS in the acclimatization was used to observe the growth of microorganisms. As part of TSS, an increase in the VSS of the sludge shows the growth of the microorganisms and a successful acclimatization for the anaerobic sludge (see Figure 4.5). The anaerobic sludge should be partially removed from the ABR if sludge washout were observed in the effluent of the ABR. Otherwise the TSS and VSS of the effluent of the ABR would increase and post-treatment may be needed to remove TSS and VSS from the effluent because high TSS concentration will block UV -light and further reduce the treatment efficiency of the UVIH20 2 process.

3.3.2 ABR Process

As soon as the 68 days of acclimatization was achieved, the ABR process was run with wastewater at various· flowrates of 6.2, 8.8, various influent concentrations of the synthetic 10.5, 13.5, and 27.6 mL/min, respectively, corresponding to the hydraulic retention times

(HRn of3.8, 2.7, 2.2, 1.7, and 0.9 days, respectively. The TOC loading rates ofthe synthetic
wastewater were ranged from 0.2 to 1.1 gi(L.day) with the change of wastewater- influent concentration and HRT. For example, a ABR process was run at the flowrate of27.6 mUmin and the influent concentration of the initial synthetic wastewater of 948.3 mg/L, which led to 0.9 days ofHRT and 1.1 g/(L.day) ofTOC loading rate. At each HRT, after the ABR system

54

was run for at least HRT long, first about 5-10 mL of the wastewater in each compartment were discharged to eliminate the effect of the sampling valves, and then about 20-30 mL of the wastewater in each compartment was quickly taken during the process to measure the concentrations of TOC, 1N, COD, CBOD5, TSS, and VSS, whilst the dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and pH of the wastewater were also measured. For each sample, two measurements of TOC, 1N, CBODs, TSS, and VSS were made. An example calculation for sample standard deviation is shown in Appendix B.

The UVIH202 process was operated at various influent concentrations of the synthetic wastewater and H202 at the HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 h, respectively. H20 2 dosages of 529 and 1371
mgH2 0~L

of wastewater were used respectively, which were the lowest and

highest findings of H20 2 dosages in the experimental trials of the combined processes. The TOC loading rates of 0.06 to 1.9 g/(L.h) with the change of influent concentration and HRT. For example, a UV/H20 2 process was run at HRT of 2.5 hand the influent concentration of diluted synthetic wastewater was 155.0 mg/L, which led to 0.06 g/(L.h) ofTOC loading rate. After mixing with each H202 dosage and being stirred manually for no less than 15 minute, the synthetic wastewater was continuously fed to the UV photoreactor by gravity from the H 20 2 solution container at various HRT adjusted manually by the valve (16). The experiment without UV irradiation, called dark experiment, was first conducted to investigate the possible adsorption of organic compounds on the UV photoreactor walls. At each HRT, after the UV/H20 2 process was run for at least HRT long, about 20-30 mL of the wastewater was quickly taken during the process to measure the concentrations of TOC, TN, COD, and CBOD5, whilst the temperature and pH of the wastewater were also measured. For each

55

sample, two measurements ofTOC, TN, and CBODs were made.

3.3.4 Combined Processes of ABR and UV/H202

The combined processes of the ABR and the UV/H202 were operated at various flowrates of 6.2, 8.8, 10.5, 13.5, and 27.6 mVmin corresponding to the HRT of 3.8, 2.7, 2.2, 1.7, and 0.9 days in the ABR, and 218, 153, 129, 100, and 49 min in the UV photoreactor, respectively. The TOC loading rates in the ABR in the combined processes were similar to those in the ABR process with the change of influent concentration and HRT. One diluted
H 2 0 2 solution (various concentrations from 0.5 to 25 mL of the H202 solution (EMD

Chemicals, Inc.) per L of the wastewater) was prepared and added respectively to the UV photoreactor through gravity at each flowrate.
~astewater

samples at each HRT and each

H 20 2 addition were taken to measure the concentrations of TOC, TN, and COD. Two replicates ofTOC, TN, and CBOD5 concentrations were made for each sample.

The COD values of the samples taken at the flowrates of 8.8, 10.5, and 13.5 mVmim were not obtained due to improper dilution of the samples. Their measurements were not redone in order to reduce the experimental cost. For the same reasons, COD measurements were not made for the wastewater with the influent concentration greater than 492 mg/L in the UV/H202 process.

If the wastewater sample contained H202, the microorganisms would die and further CBOD5 measurements would be affected. Therefore, catalase w as required to eliminate
H2 ~

/

from the samples during CBOD5 measurements. CBODs measurements in the UV/H20 2 in the combined processes were not made due to the lack of catalase. Some CBOD5 values of

56

the samples were not obtained due to the improper amount of the catalase. Their measurements were not redone because CBOD5 sample is required to be analyzed within 24 h according to Standard Methods (APHA et al., 1998).

DO values of the wastewater were used to check an anaerobic condition for the ABR process. The temperature and pH of the wastewater were used as general parameters for the ABR and the UV/H202 processes. Therefore, no duplicate samples of DO, temperature, and pH were made in the measurements.

3.4 ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES

In this study, DO, temperature, pH, TSS, VSS, TOC, TN, COD, and CBOD5 were measured according to the following analytical techniques.

3.4.1 Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

Dissolved oxygen (DO) of the samples of influent and effluent wastewater of each compartment in the ABR were measured by a dissolved oxygen meter (YSI 58 Dissolved Oxygen Meter, YSI Inc.) equipped with a BOD bottle probe (YSI 5750 Non-Stirring BOD Bottle Probe, YSI Inc.). The DO meter was first adjusted to zero readings and then was calibrated using air-saturated water by adjusting the DO reading to a corrected calibration value. Air-saturated water was obtained by aerating water for at least 15 minutes at a constant temperature which was measured through the temperature measurement function of the DO meter. A corrected calibration value was determined using the calibration value, 99%, at Toronto's altitude (76 meters above sea level). For example, the DO value at 76 m of sea
57

level is 8.92 mg/L at 21 °C, and then the corrected calibration value was calculated as follows. Corrected calibration value = 8.92
x

99% = 8.4 7 mg/L

3.4.2 Temperature and pH

Temperature and pH of the samples of influent and effluent wastewater for each compartment were measured by a Portable pH and pHJISE Meter (230Aplus, Therom Orion). Be(ore use, this meter was calibrated using either pH 4.01 and 7.00 or 7.00 and 10.01 buffer solutions, depending on the expected sample range, at room temperature. During pH measurement, the temperature was displayed automatically at the same time. The measurements were done immediately at room temperature after collecting wastewater sample.

3.4.3 Total Suspended Solid (TSS) and Volatile Suspended Solid (VSS)

TSS and VSS of the anaerobic sludge and the wastewater effluent of each compartment were measured according to Sections 25400 and 2540E of Standard Methods (APHA et a/.,. 1998) to observe the growth of microorganisms in the ABR or to assess whether the effluent solid concentrations of the ABR reached a disposal level as shown in Table 2.3, respectively. First, Ashless Circle Whatman filter papers (Whatman International Ltd., Maidston, England) and aluminium weighing dishes were dried in an oven (Binder-World) at 103-1 05°C for 1 h. Five to 10 mL of well-mixed sludge samples were separately filtered by weighed filter papers using a BUchner funnel connected to a vaccum system. Then, each of the filter papers was transferred to one weighed and dried aluminium weighing dish. The combinations of dishes, sludge samples and filter papers were first heated in the oven at 103-1 05°C for ·1 h. After

58

cooling in a desiccator, they were weighed, respectively. TSS was determL.1ed by Equation (3 .3). A sample calculation of TSS is shown in Appendix C.

where W1 is the sum of the weights of the dried filter paper, dish, and solids of sample, mg;

w2 is the weight of dried filter paper, mg; w3 is the weight of dried dish, mg; and vis the

To determine the VSS, the combinations of dishes, sludge samples, and filter papers after drying in the oven were burned in a furnace (Box Furnace, Lindberg/Blue) at 550°C for 15 minutes. After cooling in a desiccator, they were also weighed, respectively. VSS was determined by Equation (3.4). A sample calculation ofVSS is shown in Appendix D.

where W4 is the sum of the weights of solids of sample and dish after burning (the filter paper was burned in the furnace), mg; and others are the same as discussed in Equation (3.3).

3.4.4 Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Total Nitrogen (TN)

Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were measured by an Apollo 9000 Combustion TOC Analyzer (Apollo 9000 Combustion TOC Analyzer, Teledyne Tekrnar Co.) automatically. Before sample analyses, the TOC analyzer was calibrated, and_ the sam pie has to be centrifugated by a centrifuge. Standards were prepared by adding a carbon source or a nitrogen source to distilled water to achieve determined levels of carbon or nitrogen. The . ' reagent solutions were prepared as follows: · Potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) was used as an organic carbon source for TOC

59

calibration. The KHP was dried in an oven at 105°C for 2 h prior to the preparation of stock standard solution and stored in a dessicator. For preparation of a 1,000 mg/L of KHP stock standard soiution, an accurate 2, 125 mg of KHP were dissolved in distilled water and was diluted to 1 L. A series of working standard solutions, covering the expected range of sample concentrations such as 1-400 mg/L, were prepared by accurately diluting the 1,000 mg/L of stock standard solution with distilled water. Through running TOC standard calibration analysis, a TOC calibration curve for the range of 1-400 mg/L (Figure 3.2) was obtained for analyzing TOC concentrations. Both stock and working standard solutions were caped and stored in a 2 to 8°C refrigerator. · Potassium nitrate (KN03) was used as a nitrogen source for 1N calibration. Potassium nitrate was dried in the oven (Binder-World) at 80°C and cooled in the desiccator, and then 7.222 g of it were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L to prepare 1,000 mg/L of stock standard solution. A series of working standard solutions covering theexpected range of sample concentrations such as. 1-20 mg/L were prepared by accurately diluting the 1,000 mg/L of stock standard solution with distilled water. Through running 1N standard calibration analysis, a 1N calibration curve for the range of 1-20 mg/L (Figure 3.3) was obtained for analyzing 1N concentrations.

TOC removal efficiency was determined-by Equation (3.5).

3.4.5 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)

COD analysis was measured by prepackaged mercury-free and premixed COD vials (Bioscience Inc.) based on Section 5220 of Standard Methods (APHA eta/., 1998). Three types of COD vials with the ranges 5-150, 20-900 and 100-4,500 mgCODIL were used in this study. One COD vial with the ranges 5-150, 20-900, and 100-4,500 mgCODIL contained 77, 75, and 54% of sulphuric acid (H2S04, 1 mg/m3 , CAS# 7664-93-9), 0.05, 0.20, and 0.14% of potassium dichromate (K2Cr201, 0.0235 mg/L as Cr+6, CAS# 7778-50-9), 0.40, 0.40, and 0.29% of silver sulphate (AgS04 , 0.01 mg/m3 as Ag, CAS# 10294-26-5), 0.60, 0.60, and 0.43% of mercuric sulphate (HgS04, 0.05 mg/m3 as Hg, CAS# 7783-35-9), and 0.002, 0.002, and 0.0001% ofsulfamic acid (NH2S03H, CAS# 5329-14-6), respectively.

For preparation of a 10 gCOD/L of stock standard solution, potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP, KOCOC 6 ~COOH) was pre-dried to a constant weight at 11 0°C, and 8.5034
g of it were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L. A series of working standard

solutions, covering the expected range of sample concentrations such as 100-4,500 mgCODIL, were prepared by accurately diluting the 10 gCODIL of stock standard solution with distilled water. Through running standard calibration analysis, a COD standard curve for the range of 100-4,500 mgCOD/L, for example, was obtained for analyzing COD concentrations.

A COD reactor (Bioscience Inc.) was preheated to 150°C before testing. A2.5 mL sample was carefully added into one COD vial of ranges 5-150 or 20-900 mgCOD/L, and 0.5 mL sample was carefully added into one COD vial of range 100-4,500 mgCOD/L. Then the vial was thoroughly shaken by hand. COD standards and a blank (distilled water) were processed exactly the same as the samples. COD vials containing sample, COD standard, and blank,

63

PROPRY OF..._ - . RVER ON Lmt TY LIBRARY

respectively, were heated in the COD reactor for 2 h at 150±2°C, and then they were removed from the reactor and were placed in a rack until they cooled and any suspended precipitate in the vials was settled down. After the outsides of vials were wiped to remove dusts, they were placed into a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 1110 Pro, Biochrom Ltd.) one by one to measure their CODs under a standard curve covering the expected range of sample concentrations. The wavelength of 440, 600, and 600 nm were set for the ranges 5-150, 20-900 and 100-4,500 mgCODIL, respectively. According to the requirements of the test method for using the COD vials (Bioscience, Inc.), blanks of the ranges 20-900 and 100-4,500 mgCODIL were used to zero the spectrophotometer before sample testing. The highest standard (150
mg/L COD) of the range 5-150 mgCODIL was used to zero the spectrophotometer because

the standard curve of the range 5-150 mgCODIL had a negative slope and the 150 mg/L standard would read a negative absorbance if using a blank for zeroing the spectrophotometer (the spectrophotometer cannot read negative absorbance). I-f samples could not be tested within 5 h of collection, they
w~re

preserved with concentrated sulphuric acid to a pH no

greater than 2 and were refrigerated at 4°C until analysis.

The software, SWIFT II 1.000, installed in a :computer connected to the spectrophotometer was used for COD analysis. A wavelength such as 600 nm for COD range 100-4,500
mgCODIL was frrst set and absorbance was zeroed by a blank. A standard curve for this COD

range was generated by Run>Standards to get the absorbance readings of a series of standards with known COD concentrations. Each replicate of each standard was measured and stored, and the mean values were calculated. A standard curve (Figure 3.4) was then created using the mean absorbance values. The standard curve showed linearity between absorbanc~ values and known standards concentrations, and was displayed in a graph view, with the results of samples superimposed upon it.

where COD;n is COD concentration of influent wastewater sample, mg/L; and CODout is COD concentration of effluent wastewater sample, mg/L.

3.4.6 5-Day Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand (CBODs)

The analysis of the 5-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) was carried out acc~rding to Section 521 OB of Standard Methods (APHA et al., 1998). A solution, which is called dilution solution in Standard Methods 521 OB, contains the reagents of phosphate buffer solution, magnesium sulphate solution, calcium chloride solution, and ferric chloride solution. Other reagents used for CBOD5 testing include acid and alkali solutions, nitrification inhibitor, and glucose-glutamic acid solution. The solutions of phosphate buffer, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride, and ferric chloride were prepared as follows and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C after preparation.

NH4Cl were dissolved in 500 mL of distilled water and were diluted to 1 L. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 using 1 N sulfuric acid or 1 N sodium hydroxide solution. · Magnesium sulfate solution: 22.5 g MgS04·1H20 were dissolved in distilled water and was diluted to 1 L. · Calcium chloride solution: 27.5 g CaCh were dissolved in distilled water and was diluted

66

to 1 L. · Ferric chloride solution: 0.25 g FeCh·6H20 were dissolved in distilled water and was diluted to 1 L. Each BOD bottle added 0.16 g of nitrification inhibitor. · · Nitrification inhibitor: 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine (Hach Co., Formula 2533). Glucose-glutamic acid (GGA) solution: reagent grade glucose and reagent grade glutamic acid were dried at 103°C for 1 h. 150 mg glucose and 150 mg glutamic acid were dissolved in distilled water and were diluted to 1 L. Because the BOD test is a bioassay and its results can be greatly influenced by the presence of toxicants of by use of a poor seeding material. Distilled waters frequently are contaminated with copper. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically check dilution water quality, seed effectiveness, and analytical technique. Glucose-glutamic acid standard (GGA) is used to achieve this work. The GGA solution is prepared fresh immediately before use.

Ten liters dilution water was prepared each time by the following way: 1 mL of each phosphate buffer, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride, and ferric chloride per L of distilled water was added in a 20 L container. Then, dilution water was placed in an incubator (C25KC Classic Incubator Shaker, New Brunswick Scientific Co.) for at least 24 h at 20°C and was aerated by oxygen or pure air for 1 h before use.

One capsule of commercial polyseed {PolySeed®, InterLab® Supply) was added into 500
mL distilled water to prepare polyseed solution, which was aerated by pure air for 30 minutes

and then settled for 15 minutes before use.

Three to 6 mL of one sample of the synthetic wastewater, 2 mL aerated polyseed solution, and 0.16 g nitrification inhibitor were added into one weJl-cleaned 300-mL BOD bottle. All

67

samples of the synthetic wastewater were processed exactly the same. Two blanks were prepared by filling with aerated dilution water to roughly check the quality of unseeded dilution water and the cleanliness of the BOD bottles. Three seed controls were prepared by adding 10, 15, and 20 mL ofpolyseed solution into separate 300-mL BOD bottles. Two GGA standards were prepared by adding 6 mL GGA solution and 4 mL aerated polyseed solution into each BOD bottle. A magnetic stirrer bar, which was used to stir the solution in the BOD bottle to make it homogenous during BODs measurement, was placed in each bottle and then all BOD bottle were filled with the aerated dilution water up to the middle of the bottle's neck.

Initial DOs of all samples including wastewater samples, the blanks, the seed controls, and the GGA standards were first measured by a BOD bottle probe (YSI 5750 Non-Stirring BOD Bottle Probe, YSI Inc.) connected to an YSI 58 DO meter with sample agitation before incubating. All BOD bottles were incubated in the incubator at 20°C for 5 days. The 5-day DOs of all samples were measured and their CBOD5 were calculated. A sample calculation is shown in Appendix D. CBOD5 removal efficiency was determined b-y Equation (3. 7).

3.4.7 Reynolds Number

The Reynolds number is defined as a number of different situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface (http://en.wikipedia.org). For flow in a pipe or tube, experimental

68

observations show that for fully developed flow, laminar flow occurs when Re < 2300, turbulent flow occurs when Re > 4000, and transient flow occurs when 2300 < -Re < 4000. For flow in a pipe or tube and in a rectangular duct, the Reynolds number is determined by Equation (3.8).

Re= puL = pQL
J1
f.1£l

(3.8)

Where:
· · Re is Reynolds number (dimensionless); u is the mean fluid velocity, m/s;

·

L is a characteristic length that the flow is going through or around, m; for a pipe or a

tube, L equals to the diameter of the pipe or tube; for a rectangular duct, L equals to the hydraulic diameter of the rectangular duct, which is 4 times the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter;
· f1 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, kg/m.s, for water at 25°C,-JL=8.98x 10-4 kglm.s;

·

·
-·

Q is the volumetric flow rate, m 3/s; and
a is the pipe cross-sectional area, m 2 ·

In this study, the ranges of the Reynolds numbers in the ABR process, the UV/H2 0 2 process alone, and the UV/H202 of combined processes were determined to be 0.9-4.1, 3.9-19.3, and 2.7-11.9, respectively, which indicated that the flows for. all processes were laminar. The sample calculation and results are shown in Appendix E.

CHAPTER4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

After achieving the acclimatization of the anaerobic sludge, the results obtained from various experiments for the treatment of a synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater, including a biological anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) process, an advanced oxidation process (UV/I-h02 process), and their combination are discussed in this chapter.

4.1 ABR PROCESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYNTHETIC SLAUGHTHOUSE WASTEWATER

The experimental results of DO, temperature, pH values, TSS, VSS, TOC, TN, COD, and CBODs in the ABR process are discussed in this section.

4.1.1 Dissolved Oxygen of Wastewater

Tne dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of the raw wastewater was about 7.2 mg/L. The raw wastewater in the feed tank with a lid was continuously stirred by a recirculating pump to be homogeneous. The DO value of the influent wastewater was decreased to 0.6-1.2 mg/L due to the release of DO from the wastewater. After acclimatization, the DO values in compartments 1 to 5 were in the range of 0.5-1.4, 0.5-1.4, 0.5-1.4, 0.6-1.4, and 0.6-1.6 mg/L, respectively, which are depicted in Figure 4.1. A DO value of 1.4±0.6 mg/L was reported to provide an anaerobic zone for an integrated anaerobic-aerobic fixed-film reactor for the
70

treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater (Del Pozo and Diez, 2005). Therefore, this ABR process was operated under an anaerobic condition.

4.1.2 Temperature and-pH

As shown in Figure 4.2, the temperature of the wastewater in all 5 compartments was similar to those of the influent wastewater. The temperature of the influent wastewater was in the range of 21.2-25.5°C, whil-st the temperature of the wastewater in compartments 1 to 5 was in the range of 20.7-26.4, 20.4-25.8, 20.2-25.8, 20.2-25.5, and 20.2-25.7, respectively, which indicated a mesophilic digestion in the ABR process. The reason to cause the temperature fluctuations could be the room temperature, the temperature of distilled water used to prepare the synthetic wastewater, and energy release in the anaerobic digestion in the compartments.

As shown in Figure 4.3 for the entire experimental period, during the acclimatization of anaerobic sludge,_the pH values of the wastewater in compartments 1 to 5 were in the ranges of 6.5-7.5, 6.5-7.5, 6.4-7.5, 6.4-7.5, and 6.5-7.4, respectively, whilst the pH values of the influent wastewater were in the range of 6.4-7.4, which showed little difference and also implied that the anaerobic sludge had not been acclimatized successfully. After the acclimatization, the pH values of the influent wastewater were in the range of 6.4-7.5, whilst the pH values of the wastewater in compartments 1 to 5 were in the ranges of6.4-7.0, 6.3-7.0, 6.3-6.8, 6.4-6.7, and 6.4-.6.8, respectively. This showed that the pH values of the influent wastewater were higher than those of all compartments which were gradually decreased, which may be attributed to the production of acetic acid generated in the anaerobic digestion of the synthetic wastewater under acidogenesis.

4.1.3 TSS and VSS of Sludge and Wastewater

The TSS values of the anaerobic sludge during the experimental period were presented in Figure 4.4. As shown in this figure, the TSS of the anaerobic sludge decreased from day 1 to day 4, which may be attributed to the fact that the anaerobic sludge from the municipal wastewater treatment plant was diluted by introducing the synthetic wastewater into the ABR. Because the anaerobic sludge was acclimatized by gradually increasing the wastewater concentration, the microorganisms gradually adapted to the sludge and gradually grew until they reached stabilization in the ABR. Final measurement of the TSS of the sludge was conducted at day 131, and showed that the TSS of the sludge at day 131 had no significant difference compared with that at day 60. During actual experiments, no sludge washout was observed, which indicates no occurrence of sludge bulking (usually occurs when the sludge fails to separate out from the wastewater).

As shown in Figure 4.5, the VSS of the anaerobic sludge had a similar appearance as those of the TSS from day 1 to day 4 due to the same fact. After day 4, the VSS of the sludge in all compartments increased first due to the growth of the microorganisms and then stayed in higher levels during the acclimatization. It was found that the trend of VSS of the sludge looked like to fall in the log phase and then stationary phase of the bacterial growth curve shown in Figure 2.1. Therefore, a growth of microorganisms in the ABR could be identified and the anaerobic sludge was considered ready for actual experiments. Final measurement of the VSS of the sludge was also conducted on day 131, and showed decreased values in some compartments but the system still worked effectively indicating the microorganisms in the sludge were still alive. Further study should take into account a longer acclimatization period for anaerobic sludge to investigate the growth of microorganisms in the ABR process.

The TSS and VSS values of the wastewater for the flowrates of 8.8, 10.5, 13.5, and 27.6

mVmin are presented in Table 4.1 and show no trends. The TSS and VSS values for the
flowrate of 6.2 mVmin were not obtained- because there were very little solids in the wastewater and could not be measured. The results showed that the TSS of the effiuent wastewater at the flowrates of 8.8, 10.5, and 27.6 mVmin exceeded the disposal level as shown in Table 2.3. Further treatment for TSS and VSS should be considered if the treated wastewater was discharged. According to the measurement technique of TSS and VSS as discussed in Section 3.43, dried filter papers could highly affect the measurement results. Completely drying filter papers was required in order to get high precise TSS and VSS values.

concentration of 973 mg/L. The same

appearances of TOC changes occurred at the flowrates of 8.8, 10.5, and 13.5 mL/min, respectively. The TOC removal were 86.9, 86.2, and 78.3% in compartments 1 and 2 at the flowrates of 8.8, 10.5, and 13.5 mUmin, respectively, and the final TOC removal efficiencies reached 88.6, 87.9, and 83.5%, respectively. The results showed that the lower the flowrate was, the higher the TOC removal efficiency was. Since the entire ABR volume was not used to its full potential, the substrate driving forces in compartments 3, 4, and 5 might be low due to the high TOC removal in compartments 1 and 2, and acetogenesis could be higher in compartments 3, 4, and 5. At the highest flowrate of 27.6 mUmin, only 42.9% of the TOC was removed in compartments 1 and 2, and final TOC removal efficiency reached 59.4% at the flowrate of27.6 mUmin. However, it was found that the trend of full potential use of the entire ABR volume could occur at a high flowrate.

As shown in Figure 4.7, the average 1N change in the wastewater was no more than 1.6, 1.5, 6.8, 5.1, and 4.1% at the flowrates of 6.2, 8.8, 10.5, 13.5, and 27.6 mUmin, respectively. It has been reported that the nitrification was limited by DO concentrations of below 3 mg/L and denitrification was limited by DO concentrations of above 0.5 mg/L (Del Pozo and Diez, 2005). As discussed in Section 4.1.1, the range of DO values in all 5 compartments at all flowrates was 0.5-1.6 mg/L, leading to no occurrences of the nitrification and denitrification in this process. Therefore, the ABR process had no effect on 1N removal for the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater.

As Figure 4.8 shows, the COD values of the wastewater at flowrates of 6.2 and 27.6

mUmin in the ABR process show the similar appearance as the TOC. It was found that 91.5
and 53.7% of the COD were removed in compartments 1 and 2 at flowrates of 6.2 and 27.6

mL/min, respectively, and the fmal COD removal efficiencies reached 97.7 and 63.9%, respectively, which further showed that the entire ABR volume was not used to its full potential at lower flowrate. The reasons might be the same as discussed in the TOC values in the ABR reactor. Similar findings of the trend of COD values in an ABR process have been reported by Kennedy and Barriault (2007) and Bell and Buckley (2003).

As shown in Figure 4.9, the CBOD5 values of the wastewater at the flowrates of 6.2, 8.8, 10.5, 13.5, and 27.6 mL/min in the ABR process also show the similar appearance as the TOC and COD. 95.3, 63.2, 82.8, 70.3, and 63.3% of the CBOD5 were removed in compartments 1 and 2 at the flowrate of 6.2, 8.8, 10.5, 13.5, and 27.6 mL/min, and the final CBOD5 removal efticiencies reached 96.6, 89.5, 89.3, 85.6, and 84.7%, respectively. The results also showed that 'e entire ABR volume was not used to its full potential at lower flowrate such as 6.2 and 10.5 mL/min.

The complete profiles of TOC, TN, COD, and CBODs, and their removal are shown in Appendices F (Table F.1) and G (Figures G.1 to G.3), respectively. As shown in Table F.1, after the treatment of the ABR process, the ratio of CBOD5/CDD of the wastewater increased from 0.4 to 0.6 at the HRT of 3.8 days comparing with that it decreased from 0.5 to 0.2 at the HRT of 0.9 days, which indicated that the biodegradability of the effluent wastewater was enhanced at the longer HRT. The reasons may be attributed to the fact that the organic matters could be digested by the anaerobic sludge more completely at the longer HRT than that at the shorter HRT, and more nonbiodegradable intermediates might be generated at the shorter HRT. Meanwhile, the ratio of CODITOC of the wastewater decreased from 2.4 to 0.5 at the HRT of 3.8 days comparing with that it had a little change from 2.2 and 2.0 at the HRT of 0.9 days, which indicated the more organic carbons in the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater were removed at the longer HRT due to more complete digestion at longer HRT than that at

the shorter HRT. It concluded that the longer the HRT, the more TOC were removed from the wastewater, which are also shown in Figures G. I to G3. The COD values had not obtained at other HRT due to improper dilution of the samples as discussed before. As shown in Figures

G I to G3, at higher flowrate, the removal of TOC, COD, and CBOD5 were increased
gradually in all compartments of the ABR, which indicated that the ABR volume had higher possibility for full potential use at high flowrate of wastewater. Therefore, further study could take into account an ABR process with wastewater recycle stream and higher wastewater flowrates to investigate the full potential use of the ABR volume.

4.2 UV/HzOz PROCESS ALONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYNTHETIC
SLi~UGHTERHOUSE
\

WASTEWATER

Th\ experimental results of dark experiment, temperature, pH values, TOC, TN, COD, and CBOD5 in the UV/I-h02 process alone are discussed in this section.

4.2.1 Dark Experiment

The temperatures of dark experiments were in the range of 22.4-22.6°C, which were similar to the temperature of the influent wastewater. The pH values of dark experiments were in the range of 5.5-7.7, whilst the pH values of the influent wastewater were in the range of 6.0-7.4. The TOC and TN values of the wastewater in dark experiments in the UV/H202 process alone are presented in Table 4_2. It was found that the TOC values at H202 dosages of529 and 1371
mgH2 0 2/L were decreased no more than 5%. Therefore, the effect of UV photoreactor walls

on the TOC adsorption was negligible.

4.2.2. Temperature and pH

As shown in Figures 4.1 0, the temperatures of the ABR treated and untreated wastewater with the TOC influent concentrations of 155-157 mg/L increased from 24 to 30°C in the UV/H202 process alone due to the heat produced by the UV irradiation.

As shown in Figure 4.11, the pH values of the untreated wastewater with the TOC influent concentrations of 155- 157 mg/L decreased from 6.0-6.2 to 4.6-4.8 with the increase in the HRT from 0.5 to 2.5 h in the UV/H20 2 process alone. This may be attributed to the production of organic acids and carbon dioxide which is a kind of acid gas and easy to dissolve in water. On the other hand, the pH values of the ABR treated wastewater with the TOC influent concentrations of 155-157 mg/L had no significant changes (from 6.8-7.4 to 7.0-7.2 at the HRT of 0.5 h to 2.5 h, respectively), which may be attributed to the fact that the organic matters in the untreated wastewater were different from those in the treated wastewater and might be easier to be oxidized to form acids and C02.

4.2.3 TOC, TN, COD, and CBOD5

The TOC values of the untreated wastewater with the H202 dosages of 529 and 1371
mgH20.YL, which were the lowest and the highest dosages used in the combined processes, at

various HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h are presented in Figure 4.12. As shown in this figure, at the H202 dosage of 1371 mgH20 2/L, the removal efficiencies of the TOC inlet concentration of 492.7 mg/L reached 8.4, 10.3, 13.0, 17.5, and 23.2% at the HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h; and the removal efficiencies for the TOC inlet concentration of 157.6
mg/L reached 21.5, 24.5, 42.5, 46.8, and 64.3% at the HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h,

respectively. A similar appearance occurred for the TOC inlet concentrations of 968.4, 492.2, and 156.0 mg/L at the H202 dosage of 529 mg/L. At the HRT of 2.5 h, for the inlet concentrations of 492.2-492.7 mg/L, the TOC removal efficiency (23.2o/o) at the H 2 0 2 dosage of 1371 mgH202/L was higher than that (8.4%) at the H202 dosage of 529 mgH20 2/L. Similarly, at the HRT of 2.5 h, for the inlet concentrations of 156.0-157.6 mg/L, the TOC removaJ effieiency (64.3%) at the H2 0 2 dosage of 1371 mgH20.YL was also higher than that (34.5%) at the H20 2 dosage of 529 mgH202/L, which was the maximum TOC removal efficiency of the untreated synthetic wastewater. These results showed that ( 1) the longer the HRT was, the higher the removal efficiency of the TOC was; (2) the higher the H 20 2 dosage ( 13 71 mgH20.YL) was, the more TOC was removed from the wastewater; and (3) the lower the TOC inlet concentration, the higher the removal efficiency was. The reason may be attributed to the fact that
Ic~ng

HRT and the higher H20 2 dosage could increase the oxidation

ofTOC due to long contra\ and reaction time between TOC and H202.

The TN values of the untreated wastewater with the H202 dosages of 529 and 1371 mg/L at the HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h in the UV/H202 process alone are presented in

the CBOD5 removal efficiencies for the untreated wastewater

with the inlet concentration of 492.7 mg/L reached 11.4, 11.4, 18.2, 25.0, and 47.7% at the HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h; and those with the inlet concentration of 157.6 mg/L reached 40.2, 60.2, 72.3, 77.1, and 84.3% at the HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h, respectively.

The complete profiles of TOC, TN, COD, and CBODs, and their removal are shown in Appendices F (Table F.2) and G (Figures G.4 to G6), respectively. As shown in Table F.2, after the treatment of the UV/H202 process, the ratios of CBODs/COD of the untreated and the ABR treated wastewater with the inlet TOC concentration of 155.0-156.0 mg/L increased from 0.4 to 0.6 (the H 202 dosage of 529 mg/L) and 0.3 to 0.5 (the H20 2 dosage of 1371 mg/L), respectively, at the HRT of 2.5 h, which indicated that the UV /H2 0 2 process could enhance the biodegradability of the wastewater. Meanwhile, their ratios of CODffOC decreased from 2.3 to 0.6 and 1.8 to 0.9, respectively, which indicated that the UV/H20 2 process had an ability to remove organic carbons in the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater. As shown in Figures G4 to G6, the longer the HRT was, the higher the removal efficiencies of TOC, COD, and CBOD 5 of the untreated wastewater were reached.

4.3 COMBINED PROCESSES OF ABR AND UV/H202 FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYNTHETIC SLAUGHTERHOUSE WASTEWATER

4.3.1 TOC, TN, COD, and CBOD5

The TOC values of the wastewater with various H202 dosages in the UV/H2 0 2 process are presented in Figure 4.16. As shown in this figure, at the flowrates of 6.2, 8.8, 10.5, 1J.5, and 27.6 mL/min, the TOC removal reached 89.9, 88.6, 87.9, 83.5, and 59.4% in the ABR process, and a further removal of 50.8, 89.0, 46.0, 26.4, and 16.5% in the UV/H20 2 process, respectively, leading to the overall TOC removal of 95.0, 98.8, 93.5, 87.8, and 66.0% in the combined processes as shown in Appendix G Figure G.7. This indicates that the treatment of TOC was improved in the combined processes. The concentrations of the ABR inlet and the lowest concentrations in the UVIH202 process were used to calculate the overall TOC

removal in the combined processes. The concentrations of the ABR outlet (the eflluent of compartment 5) were used as the influent concentrations to calculate the TOC removal in the UV/H202 process. At the flowrate of 8.8 mL/min, half values of the ABR outlet were used as inlet concentration to calculate the TOC removal efficiency in the UV/H20 2 process because the ABR outlet was diluted by half by the H 20 2 solution through using the same flowrate as that of the wastewater (not occurred in other wastewater flowrates where the flowrate of

Also as shown in Figure 4.16, the TOC was decreased first and then increased with the increase of H202 dosage in the UV/H20 2 process, which was attributed to the fact that H202 acts as both an oxidant and a radical scavenger (Glaze et al., 1987; Stefan et al., 1996), especially at high dosages, and excessive H 20 2 reacts with hydroxyl radical, ·oH, competing with organic compounds and consequently reducing their removal efficiencies (Rodriguez

eta/., 2005; Varatharajan and Kanmani, 2007). The H 20 2 dosages of 529, 602, 720, 1122, and
13 71 mg/L in the combined processes were found to result in maximum TOC removal for the flowrates of 27.6, 13.5, 10.5, 8.8 and 6.2 mL/min, respectively, which indicates that more H 20 2 is required to oxidize more TOC in the wastewater caused by low flowrate.

As discussed in Section 4.1.4 and 4.2.3, the 1N of the wastewater had no significant changes in the ABR and UV/H20 2 processes.-To be compared, the TN was also measured in the combined processes. The TN values of the synthetic wastewater in the UV/H20 2 process are presented in Figure 4.17. It showed that the TN had not significant changes at the
fl~wrate~ 10.5, 13.5, and 27.6 mlimin. The average changes of the TN had no more

be attributed the fact that the organic matters in the wastewater had long contact time with UV/lh02 at lower flowrate leading to more changes of TN. At the flowrate of 8.8 mL/min, the average change of TN was about 47.0% which may be attributed to the fact that the ABR effluent was diluted by the H202 solution which had the similar flowrate (8.8 mL/min) to that of the wastewater. The results showed that the combined processes had no significant effect on the TN removal. Further study may be carried out to investigate the effect of pH on the TN degradation.

COD removal efficiencies of the wastewater in the combined processes· at the flowrate of 27.6 mUmin with various H 20 2 dosages are presented in Figure 4.18. As shown in this figure, the COD was also decreased first and then increased with the increase ofH20 2 dosage in the UV/H202 process due to the same reason as discussed in the TOC values. H20 2 dosage of 529

mg/L, similar to the result in maximum TOC removal at the same_flowrate, was found to
/

result in a maximum COD removal of 65.5%. The COD at other flowrates were not obtained due to improper dilution of the COD samples.

To compare the combined processes and the UV/H202 process alone, the ABR treated wastewater with 155.0-157.6 mg/L of TOC influent concentration was prepared. The TOC values of the ABR treated and untreated wastewater at the H20 2 dosages of 529 and 137I

It was found that at the H20 2 dosage of 529 mg/L, the highest TOC removal efficiencies of the ABR treated and untreated wastewater reached 36.2 and 34.5o/o at the HRT of 2.5 h, respectively. Also, at the H20 2 dosage of 1371 mg/L, the highest TOC removal efficiencies of the ABR treated and untreated wastewater reached 37.3

and 64.3% at the HRT of2.5 h, respectively. The results showed that (1) higher H202 dosage had higher effect on the TOC removal, and (2) the UV/H202 process had higher effect on the

roc

removal in the untreated wastewater, which may be attributed to the intermediat-es

generated in the ABR process. Further study may take into account higher H202 dosages and longer HRT for the TOC removal.

The CBOD5 values of the ABR treated and untreated wastewaters which had the similar TOC concentration (155.0-157.6 mg/L) in the UV process are compared in Figure 4.20. As shown, the ABR treated wastewater had lower CBOD5 concentration (96.0 mg/L) than that of the untreated wastewater (124.5 mg/L) due to some of CBOD5 had been removed from the ABR process. It was found that at the H20 2 dosage of 1371 mg/L, the removal efficiency of the untreated wastewater (84.3%) was higher than that ofthe ABR treated wastewater (53.1%) at the HRT of 2.5 h, which showed that the UV/H2 0 2 process had significant effect on the CBOD5 removal in the untreated wastewater. Similar fmdings were obtained in the removal ofTOC and the COD in the untreated wastewater.

The complete

profil~s

of TOC and 1N of the synthetic wastewater in the combined

processes are shown in Appendices F (Table F.3) and G (Figures G 7 to G 10). As shown in Figure-- G7, the lower the tlowrate was, the higher the overall TOC removal efficiency was achieved except for the flowrate of 8.8 mUm in. As shown in Figures G8 to G 10, the removal efficiencies ofTOC, COD, and CBOD5 of the untreated wastewater were higher than those of the treated wastewater, indicating that the UV/H20 2 process had more effect on the untreated wastewater, which may be attributed to the fact that the final organic products and intermediates generated in the ABR process might be more difficult to be oxidized by UV/H202 than the untreated wastewater.

As shown in Figure 4.12, the H20 2 dosage of 1371 mgH20:IL for the TOC influent of 157.6 mg/L in the UV/H2 0 2 process was found to result in a maximum TOC removal at the HRT of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h, respectively. As shown in Figure 4.16, the
H202

dosages

of 529, 720, and 1371 mgH20:IL for the TOC influents of 385.4, 117.4, and 98.4 mg!L in the UV/H20 2 of the combined processes were found to result in maximum TOC removal for the HRT of 0.9, 2.2, and 3.8 days, respectively. Therefore, the ratios of H2 0 2 concentration by TOC influent concentration and HRT of these findings are depicted in Figure 4.21. As shown in this figure, an optimum ratio of 3.5 (mgH20:IL)/(mgTOCiriL.h) was found to result a maximum TOC removal of 64.9% in the UV/H20 2 process.

To evaluate the optimum H2 0 2 ratio of 3.5 (mgH 20 2/L)/(mgTOCiriL.h), the experiments at the flowrates of 6.2, 10.5, and 13.5 mL/min, respectively, were replicated in the UV/H2 0 2 process . .The influent TOC concentrations of the experiments were prepared to be 100.1, 120.6, and 99.3 mg/L at the flowrates of 6.2, 10.5, and 13.5 mL/min based on the TOC outlet concentrations at these flowrates (98.4, 117.4 and 110.9 mg/L), respectively. Therefore, the H 2 0 2 dosages used in the replicated experiments w.ere. determined to be 1250, 880, and 647 mg/L at the flowrates of 6.2, 10.5, and 13.5 mL/min, respectively. The comparison of TOC removal efficiencies between the previous experimental findings and the replicated experimental findings obtained by using the optimum H2 0 2 dosages is presented in Table 4.3.

As shown in this table, the TOC removals (64.0, 63.5, and 60.1 %) of the replicated experiments were higher than those of previous experiments (50.8, 46.0, and 26.4%) at the flowrates of 6.2, 10.5, and 13.5 mL/min, respectively, where all were closed to the highest

4.5-INVESTIGATION--OF MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION FOR COMBINED PROCESSES FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYNTHETIC SLAUGHTERHOUSE WASTEWATER

4.5.1 Investigation of Kinetic Modeling for the ABR Process

The combined processes of ABR and UV/H202 without recycle were designed for the treatment of the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater which consisted of soluble complex organic compounds as discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The synthetic wastewater and sludge were mixed by changing the wastewater flow direction through alternate downflow and

J
upflow and passed through the anaerobic sludge layer in each compartment. The kinetic model Equation (2.18) developed by Barthakur et al. ( 1991) for substrate utilization in an anaerobic digestion took into account extracellular hydrolysis of complex substrates and used
106

hydrolyzed products as the limiting substrates for cell growth and substrates digestion as discussed in Section 2.2.1. Therefore, Equation (2.18) was used to evaluate the performance of the ABR process in this study.

To determine the kinetic parameters flm, A, Ks, and R in the model, the non-linear least-square function F (Draper and Smith, 1981), which is used to fit a set ofm observations with a non-linear model in n unknown parameters (m > n), is established as shown in Equation (4.1) (Barthakur eta/., 1991; Setiadi et al., 1996). A MatLab function "lsqnonlin" (Version 7.5.0 R2007b), which is designated to solve the problem of non-linear least square and requires the user-defined function to compute the vector-valued function, is used to minimize the function F through the best-fit criterion which means two sets of data are the most close to each other.

The influent (S7JJ) and eftluent (Sr, in compartment 5) TOC concentrations of the ABR at different HRT as shown in Figure 4.6 were used in Equations (2.18) and (4.1 ). Invoking MatLab function "lsqnonlin", a set of values for parameters R. A, Ks, and f.lm were given at one set of start point which was used by "lsqnonlin" to start searching to fmd minimum result ofEquation (4.1). The frrst trial of start points, (R=0.7, A=0.01, Ks
=12~

f.lm=2), was adopted

from Setiadi et al. (1996). At each searching, only one set of optimum values was obtained, which indicated that the set of optimum values was global optimum values. Four sets of start points were used for searching, leading to 4 sets of values for R. A, Ks, and f.lm, which are presented in Table 4.4. Through substituting these 4 sets of parameters into Equation (2.18) to estimate the effluent TOC concentration of the ABR process at each flowrate, the average absolute relative errors of each set of parameters between the experimental data and the predicted values gave 7.9, 6.8, 6.2, and 5.4%, respectively, as also shown in Table 4.4. The parameters R. A, Ks, andf.lm of3.1x10-2, 0.4, 2.0 mg/L, and 1.9 day- 1 with the lowest absolute relative error (5.4%) were selected to obtain the kinetic model Equation (4.2) for the ABR process. Comparing with the parameter R of 0.7 obtained by Setiadi eta!. (1996), the result showed that the synthetic slaughterhouse- wastewater used in this study had higher hydrolysable substrate due to the very low refractory coefficient (3.1 x 1o-2), indicating that the wastewater was biodegradable, which agreed with the experimental measurement of the ratio of CBOD5/COD (0.4-0.5). 0.39+ 2.0

The MatLab code for function "lsqnonlin" is shown in Appendix H.

4.5.2 Investigation of Optimization for Total Electricity Cost and Hydraulic Retention Time for the ABR Process

Hydraulic retention time (HRT) is an important parameter for a wastewater treatment system, which will largely affect the final removal efficiency of organic pollutants in wastewater and the total costs of operating and maintenance (O&M) for the treatment system.
It is necessary to optimize the total HRT of the treatment system. In a laboratory scale, the

consumption of electricity and chemicals is a major part of O&M costs. Therefore, only electricity cost and cost of H2 0 2 consumption per mass of TOC removed were considered in the optimization of the total O&M costs of the combined processes in this study.

The cost of electricity per mass of TOC removed in a continuous system was estimated by Equation (4.3), which was defmed for high TOC influent concentration because the reaction rate of TOC was directly proportional to the rate of electricity use (Bolton et a/., 2001). Therefore, the electricity cost oftheABR is presented in Equation (4.4).

Administration (2008) was $0.055 /KWh. The calculated values of the electricity costs per mass of TOC removed for the ABR using Equations (4.2) and (4.4) with the assumption of 1000 mg/L influent TOC concentration for the ABR process are presented in Table 4.5. The total electricity costs per mass ofTOC removed for the ABR are depicted in Figures 4.23.

As shown in Table 4.5 and Figure 4.23, the minimum total electricity cost of the ABR process was $4.55 /kg ofTOC removed at the HRT of21 h, leading to 397.7 mg/L of effluent TOC concentration from the ABR process. After this HRT, it was observed that the total electricity cost of the ABR process was increased with the increase of the HRT, leading to a low effluent TOC concentration. According to disposal level for meat processing in Canada shown in Table 2.3, the effluent COD concentration of wastewater is regulated to be no greater than 250 mg/L. As discussed before, the ratio of COD/TOC of the synthetic wastewater was around 2.2-2.4, leading to about 104.2-114.6 mg/L of the TOC disposal level for the synthetic wastewater. Obviously, the TOC effluent concentrations of the ABR process (397.7 mg/L) at the HRT of 21 h with the minimum electricity cost exceeded this dispesal level (1 04.2-114.6 mg/L).

In order to determine the optimum HRT of the ABR process under the TOC disposal

level, optimization scheme for the ABR was established and solved. The influent TOC concentration of the wastewater was assumed to be 1000 mg/L. Therefore, the effluent TOC of the ABR should not exceed 1000 mg/L. By solving the inequality (4.5), the smallest retention time of the ABR process should be 0.53 days or 12.7 h. Therefore, the optimization scheme of the ABR process is presented in Equations (4.6) and (4.7).

The MatLab function "fmincon", which is designated to solve the minimum of a constrained nonlinear multi variable function, is a gradient-based method that is designed to work on problems where the objective and constraint functions are both continuous and have continuous first derivatives. It attempts to find a constrained minimum of a scalar function of several variables starting at an initial estimate through a line searching and uses a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method.

Setting 100 mg/L as a restriction for TOC effluent for the ABR process and using the
115

function "fmincon" to solve Equations (4.6) and (4. 7}, the optimum HRT and the minimum electricity cost of the ABR process alone were determined to be 78.9 h and $11.45 /kg of TOC removed, respectively, giving 100.0 mgTOCIL of the effluent concentration which met the TOC disposal level. The results showed that the optimum HRT corresponding to the minimum electricity consumption of the process depends on the restriction of the TOC effluent concentration. Matlab code of function "fmincon" is shown in Appendix I.

At lab scale, the total O&M costs consist of the total electricity costs and the cost of chemical consumption per mass of TOC removed. Therefore, the total O&M costs of the ABR process were the total electricity cost, which was $11.44 /kg of TOC removed.

CHAPTERS CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS -

5.1 CONCLUSIONS

A biological anaerobic ba:ffied reactor (ABR), an UV/H20 2 process, and their combination were developed at laboratory scale for the treatment of a synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater in this study. The performance and the treatment ability of the ABR process, the UV/H2 0 2 process, and their combination for the treatment of the synthetic wastewater were identified through the measurements of the removal efficiencies of TOC, COD, and CBOD5 · The ratio ofCBOD 5/COD of the untreated synthetic wastewater was about 0.4-0.5, which indicated the synthetic wastewater was biodegradable, whilst the ratio of CODffOC was about 2.2-2.4.

The ABR process had high treatment ability for the untreated synthetic wastewater. The removal efficiencies of TOC, COD, and CBOD 5 of the wastewater with an influent concentration of 973 mgTOC/L and a HRT of 3.8 days reached 89.9, 97.7, and 96.6%, respectively. The longer the hydraulic retention time was, the higher the removal efficiency of the wastewater was. Most of organic pollutants were removed in the first and second compartments in the ABR. After the treatment of the ABR process, the ratio of CBOD5/COD of the wastewater changed from 0.4 to 0.6 at the HRT of 3.8 days and 0.5 to 0.2 at the HRT of 0.9 days indicating that the biodegradability of the wastewater was enhanced after longer HRT, whilst the ratio ofCOD/TOC ofthe wastewater decreased from 2.4 to 0.5 at the HRT of 3.8 days comparing with that it had a little change from 2.2 to 2.0 at the HRT of 0.9 days,

117

indicating that more organic carbons in the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater were removed after the longer HRT.

Th·e UV/H20 2 process had lower treatment ability than that of the ABR process. The removal efficiencies of TOC, COD, and CBOD5 of the untreated wastewater with an influent concentration of 158 mgTOCIL, a HRT of 2.5 h and a H202 dosage of 1371
mgH20~L

reached 64.9, 81.9, and 84.3%, respectively. The highet: the H202 dosage or the longer the HRT were, the higher the removal efficiency was achieved. After mixing with H202 solution, the ratio of CBODs/COD of the synthetic wastewater was about 0.3-0.4. After the treatment of the UV/H202 process, the ratios of CBOD5/COD of the untreated and the ABR treated wastewater increased from 0.4 to 0.6 and 0.3 to
o~5

at the HRT of 2.5 h, respectively,

indicating that the UV/H202 process had the ability to enhance the biodegradability of the effluent wastewater. Meanwhile, the ratios of CODffOC orthe wastewater decreased from that the UV/H20 2 process had an ability to 2.3 to 0.6 and 1~ 8 to 0.9, respectively, indicating _ remove organic carbons in the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater.

The combined processes of ABR and UV/H20 2 were proved to be able to improve the treatment ability of the TOC of the synthetic wastewater. The overall TOC removal efficiency . of the wastewater with an influent concentration of 973 mgTOC/L reached 95-.0% (89.9% in the ABR and 50.8% in the UV/H202 process) at HRT of3.8 days for the ABR process and 3.6
h for the UV/H202 process with 1371
mgH20~L

of H20 2. An optimum ratio of H20 2

concentration by TOC influent concentration and HRT was found to be 3.5
(mgH20~L)/(mgTOCiriL.h).

No significant changes of the total nitrogen were observed in all processes including the

118

ABR process, the UV/H202 process, and their combination, which may be attributed to the fact that the nitrification and denitrification could not occur in an anaerobic condition.

A kinetic model was investigated for the ABR process to evaluate the effluent TOC concentrations of the wastewater at a specified HRT in steady-state conditions. Based on the experimental data, the parameters of the kinetic model for the ABR process were determined

2 to be 3.Ix10- for refractory coefficient, 0.4 for kinetic coefficient, 2.0 mg/L for
half-saturation constant for hydrolyzed substrate, and 1.9 day- 1 for the maximum specific growth rate of organism, respectively. The kinetic model gave an agreement between the predicted values and the experimental data.

An optimization scheme for the ABR process involving the kinetic model for the ABR process was established and solved with the assumption of 1000 mg/L of influent TOC concentration and no greater than 100 mg/L of effluent TOC concentration of the synthetic wastewater, respectively. The optimum total HRT and the minimum electricity cost of the ABR process were determined to be 78.9 hand $11.45 /kg of TOC removed, respectively, giving 100.0 mgTOC/L of the effluent concentration.

5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS

·

Further study should take into account a longer acclimatization period for anaerobic sludge to investigate the growth of microorganisms in the ABR process.

·

Further study could take into account wastewater recycle stream and high wastewater flowrates in the ABR process to investigate the full potential use of the ABR volume.

·

The accumulation of volatile fatty acids and the collection of biogas in each

119

compartment of the ABR could be taken into account to investigate the activities of acidogenesis and methanogenesis there. · Further study may take into account higher H20 2 dosages and longer HRT to investigate the high treatment ability of the UV/H202 process. · Further experiments could take into account the effect of pH and alkalinity on the treatment of TOC and TN in the synthetic wastewater in the UV/H2(h process. · · Further study could take into account process redesign for total nitrogen removal. Actual slaughterhouse wastewater could be used in the combined processes to evaluate its experimental findings and the possibility of application in practice.

Appendix A. Determination of TOC and TN of Synthetic Wastewater

As mentioned in Section (3.1), the carbon source of the synthetic slaughterhouse wastewater came from the meat extract (17 amino acids) and glycerol, whilst the nitrogen source came from the similar meat extract and ammonium chloride. The calculated values of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) of the initial synthetic wastewater based on these 17 amino acids are shown in Table A.1.

Taking alanine (AL, C3H7N02) as calculation sample, the % w of TOC /w of meat extract and the% w ofTN /w of meat extract in the initial wastewater are determined as follows:

Appendix B. Determination of Standard Deviation and Relative Error

Relative error is used to express an accuracy of an accept value of the quantity being measured, which is determined as follows (Skoog et a/, 1998). Relative error could be positive, zero, or negative indicating that the measured value is smaller than, equal to or greater than the mean of a set of data. The lowest average absolute relative error was used as criterion to select a kinetic model for the ABR and the UV/H20 2 processes. Relative error = x - x, x 100%

x,
where Xt is an accepted value; and x is mean of a finite set of data.

(B.l)

Sample standard deviation is used to analyze the accuracy of an experimental measurement for a finite set of experimental data. Sample mean ( x) and sample standard deviation (s) are determined as follows (Skoog et al., 1998).

(B.2)

(B.3) where x; is the measurement value of sample i; and N is the total number of measurements.

For example, the influent CBODs concentrations of two samples were determined to be in
1020 and 1032 mg/L, respectively, at the HRT 0.9 days in the ABR process. Therefore, the mean, the sample standard deviation, the relative error, and the average relative error of the influent CBOD 5 concentrations are detennined as follows.

Appendix C. Determination of TSS and VSS

The TSS and VSS were determined by Equations (3.3) and (3.4) based on Standard

Methods (APHA eta/., 1998). TSS(mg/ L) = (~

(3.3)

where all parameters are the same as defined in Section 3.4.3.

For example, at a HRT of 0.9 days (27.6 mVmin of flowrate) of the ABR, the TSS and VSS of sludge in the compartment 1 are shown in Table C.l.

Appendix D. Determination of CBOD5

CBOD5 of wastewater was determined by the following equation based on 521 OB

Standard Methods (APHA eta/., 1998).
CBODs = (Dl-DJ-SCF

p

(C.l)
(C.2)

where:

· · ·

D 1 is the DO of a diluted sample immediately after preparation, mg/L; D 2 is the DO of the same diluted sample after 5·days incubation at 20°C, mg/L; SCF is seed correction factor, mg/L;

·

P is decimal volumetric fraction of sample used, where P=volume of sample/volume of BOD-bottle;
141

· ·

B I is the DO of seed control before incubation, mg/L; B 2 is the DO of seed control after incubation, mg/L; and

·

fis the ratio of the volume ofpolyseed solution in glucose-glutamic acid (GGA) test
to the volume of polyseed solution in seed controL

For example, the influent CBODs concentration was measured at the HRT ofG-.9 days in the ABR process. Each 300-mL BOD bottle contained 1 mL of influent wastewater (P=l/300). The volume of polyseed solution used in GGA test was 4 mL. Three seed controls were prepared using 10, 15, 20 mL of polyseed solution, respectively. A DO meter (YSI 58 Dissolved Oxygen Meter, YSI Inc.) and a BOD bottle probe (YSI 5750 Non-Stirring BOD Bottle Probe, YSI Inc.) were used to measure the DO of all samples .. The DO of the dilution water (D I) was measured to be 9.5 mg/L. The average D 2 of two diluted influent wastewater samples was 5.5 mg/L. The D 2 of the 3 seed controls measured by the DO meter and SCF values are showed in Table D.1.

Therefore, the influent CBOD5 of the wastewater at the HRT of 0.9 days in the ABR J?rocess was determined as follows.
CBOD5

= (9 ·5 -

S.S)- 0·6 1/300

= 1026.0

Appendix E: Reynolds number in the ABR, the UV/H202, and the combined processes

For flow in a pipe or tube and in a rectangular duct, the Reynolds number is determined by Equation (3.8).

Re= puL = pQL
J.1
J.1f1

(3.8)

Where:

·
·

Re is Reynolds number (dimensionless);
u is the mean fluid velocity, m/s;

·

L is a characteristic length that the flow is going through or around, m; for a pipe or a tube, L equals to the diameter of the pipe or tube; for a rectangular duct, L equals to the hydraulic diameter of the rectangular duct, which is 4 times the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter, P;

·

f1 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, kg/m.s, for water at 25°C, f1=8.98x 10 kg/m.s;

4

·
·

p is the density of the fluid, kg/m 3, for water at 25°C, p= 1000 kg/m 3 ;
Q is the volumetric flow rate, m 3/s; and

·

a is cross-sectional area, m 2·

For example, the length and width of the ABR reactor are 10 and 15 em, respectively. At the flowrate of27.6 mL/min, the hydraulic diameter of the ABR and the Reynolds number are determined as follows. The calculation results of the Reynolds number in the ABR, the UV/H20 2 and their combined processes are shown in Table E.1. 1m 1m 4 x 1Ocm x - - x 15cm x - L = 4 xa = 100cm lOOcm = O.l 2 m 1 p 2x(l0cm+ 15cm)x-m IOOcm
