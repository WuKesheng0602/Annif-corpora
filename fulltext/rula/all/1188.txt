INTRODUCTION

Urbanization of city centres has drastically modified the movement characteristics of water within city boundaries. This movement of water on a larger scale is known as the hydrologic cycle. The basic components of the hydrological cycle include

precipitation, evaporation, evapotranspiration, infiltration, overland flow, stream flow and ground water flow (Bedient & Huber, 2008). The various components can be spatial and temporally erratic, resulting to extremes that may lead to flooding and drought. Figure 1-1 show the components of the hydrological cycle. Within

urban areas, the components of infiltration and overland flow are the most affected. Precipitation is converted to overland flow or runoff and termed 'stormwater' when outlining urban problems. Analysis of the hydrological cycle, specifically in urban

systems is necessary for the protection of society and the environment from events such as flooding, erosion and water pollution.

methods for calculating peak discharge. Also known as the Lloyd-Davies method in the United Kingdom, the Rational method was the first to include the variable of rainfall frequency in the prediction of peak flow and greatly aided the design of culverts (as cited in ASCE, 1992). However, the rational formula did not provide

the 'shape' or the instantaneous volume vs. time during the storm water event (known as a hydrograph). A new unit hydrograph method, advanced by Sherman

in 1932 (as cited in Guo, 1998), was proposed to overcome this shortcoming. This method attempts to relate both the peak discharge and the volume of the total runoff to storm characteristics. Additional meteorological, geographical and

economic inputs have been factored into the development of other models. To fully characterize the hydrological cycle of a drainage system, designers today use continuous conditions. modelling to study its hydrological response under a variety of

several stages during urban development do not require the accuracy of a complex analysis tool, such as a CSM. There are different needs from designers and

planners at different stages of urban drainage design . During the earlier planning, screening and preliminary phases, limited details are available with which to design a complete system. Although most decision makers want to have solid scientific

and mathematical assurances, a continuous model based on assumptions that may change later is not beneficial. Further, continuous simulation modelling can

introduce excessive costs and delays to the early .design stages, being relatively cumbersome and time consuming due to the data gathering, synthesis and the model creation required. The learning curves for some modelling packages can be steep. The preliminary phases of system design are meant to be relatively short

and would benefit from a simpler method or model. Analytically-derived models and tools can be used as alternatives to continuous simulation modelling. Analytically derived models have evolved such that they offer ease and flexibility while considering long-term meteorology (Smith, 1980) . This

type of modelling is based on statistics derived from long-term meteorological inputs. Although lacking in detail, these models can be of great use, especially This does

Guo (1998) continued this research and further enhanced

the analytical models to account for additional parameters such as infiltration (water seepage into the soil) and depression storage (water ponded on natural land surfaces). Since the most important components of the hydrological cycle for urban applications is runoff (overland flow), the analytical methods by Adams and Papa (2000) and Guo (1998) do not provide models for stream flow and ground water flow. A comparison of CSM and analytical models for urban stormwater applications is shown in Table 1-1. The analytical models developed from the researchers at the University of Toronto show promise as planning tools.

urban drainage systems, green roof technology was recently identified as a potential control measure to reduce storm water impacts. Green roof technology

has been identified as a storm water best management practice (BMP) along with

5

other traditional methods (Banting et al., 2005).

A green roof is a roof covered

with a layer of soil, subsurface matrix and selective vegetation, having various terms such as eco-roof, nature roof or living roof (Perry, 2003). Application of

green roof technology is typically only feasible in an urban setting. The sloped and often widely dispersed roofs of rural areas do not make the implementation cost effective. Two main types of green roofs have been illustrated in the literature: Intensive green roofs can involve manicured lawns,

intensive and extensive.

shrubs, trees, flowers and usually have deeper soil material. They typically require ongoing maintenance and in some cases are expensive and impractical (Perry, 2003). Extensive green roofs include ground cover plants, a thinner soil layer and Extensive green roofs can be installed on roofs with Current literature and

slopes of up to 40 degrees (Gedge & Kadas, 2005).

development focuses on the extensive green roof type (Perry, 2003).

Figure 1-2: Layers of a Green Roof (Moran et al., 2003)

Research and pilot studies have analyzed the hydrological benefits of green roofs (Complete discussion provided in Chapter 2). Studies show that the conversion of a roof space into a pervious area can both reduce the quantity and improve the

6

quality of the storm runoff. Liesecke (1998) showed that a green roof with a media depth of 2-4 em can retain 40 to 45°/o of the annual rainfall. Li (2006) showed that green roofs have the ability to intercept, store and retain moderate and small storm events. Similarly, according to Moran et al. (2003) and Rowe et al. (2003), green

roofs can retain up to 100°/o of the rainfall volume depending on the volume, intensity and duration. Several of the reviewed studies were performed in Europe, where research and implementation of green roofs is more mature than in North America (Banting et al., 2005). In 1997, the City of Toronto initiated the development of a Wet Weather Flow Management Master Plan (WWFMMP) (City of Toronto, 2003). The main problem

that initiated the plan was the degradation of the City's watersheds and near-shore zone of Lake Ontario. The project goals were to develop a strategy to manage wet weather flow on a watershed basis, to improve the health of Toronto's

watercourses, and to enhance the natural environment.

The WWFMMP also gave

support to the implementation and use of green roof technology (City of Toronto,

2003). In support of this initiative, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority
(TRCA) retained a consultant to develop a "Hydrological Simulation ProgramFortran" (HSP-F) model and a "Unit Response Function" (URF) model in 2004 (Banerjee, 2004). The HSP-F model is a continuous simulation model. The URF

model is a simplified model, relating the rainfall to runoff transformation to parcels of land and their corresponding land use. The URF model also incorporates land

use types assuming the implementation of green roof technology which was based on the York University green roof monitoring program undertaken by the TRCA in

2003-2004 (TRCA, 2006).

The HSP-F and URF models were developed and

7

calibrated using meteorological data, based on a hydrological response of a 10 ha test catchment. Eligible green roof area was assumed to be 75°/o pervious (green

roof) and 25°/o impervious (roof). The HSP-F model was calibrated for the Highland Creek and used to estimate the runoff reduction and peak flow reduction of implementing green roof technology (Banerjee, 2004; Maunder, 2004). Another CSM was created with the Quantity-Quality Simulation (QQS) model used to predict the total annual combined sewer overflow (CSO) of several watersheds in the GTA (Li, 2007). An analytical model, the Sustainable Urban Drainage System

(SUDS) model was calibrated to the QQS model to predict CSO events and cost savings (Li, 2007). The number of research studies is still somewhat limited on the overall effect of green roof technology on a watershed basis. Results from these

watershed-wide studies have shown that benefits are more modest when compared to individual green roofs. Since predicting the impact of green roof technology on a watershed basis is impractical to study on an experimental or laboratory basis, modelling tools and methods must be used. An established analytical model to predict the runoff reduction resulting from the implementation of green roof technology on a watershed basis would greatly benefit the planning and preliminary stages of urban stormwater management systems. Currently, the existing green roof projects in North America are isolated, single building efforts within large urban areas. have a small effect. One or two buildings in a watershed will

across an urban centre will have a more dramatic effect.

The analytical model is simple to use and has the ability to predict annual total runoff volume over an entire watershed. Although such a model still requires data collection per watershed, the calculations are easy to reproduce and based on wellknown methods of statistical analysis. If the results are demonstrated to be Hydrological models should

be calibrated using observed data or post-calibrated data to increase the confidence of the model results (Au, 2007). The HSP-F model developed for the Highland

Creek watershed provides a solid foundation for calibrating the analytical model presented by Adams & Papa (2000), thereby creating a simple, powerful tool by which to assess the impact of green roof technology in storm water management on a watershed basis. 1.1 Objectives

liTERATURE REVIEW

The topic of this study is applied and multi disciplinary, combining analytical tools for modelling with new innovative technologies for storm water management and design. analytical As such, this chapter reviews the literature in three main topic areas: hydrological modelling, hydrological benefits of green roofs and

hydrological modelling of green roofs.

2.1

Howard (1976) developed the model (as cited in Guo,

1998) with rainfall volume and interevent time to analyze the runoff diverted to a

further by modelling a series of catchments in sequence by Schwarz & Adams

(1981) and Adams & Bontje (1984). Analytical models were well developed.
A comparison between analytical and simulation models was performed by

Kauffman (1987). The results showed that favourable agreement existed between the two models. Since the analytical model is dependent on statistical data of

rainfall an extensive database for parameters was initially developed and published by Belanger ( 1992). Validation of the analytical model with continuous simulation

models has shown reasonable agreement (within 5-20°/o) (Li, 1991; Li & Adams,

1990; Li & Adams , 1993; Li & Adams, 1994; Papa & Adams, 1997) . Chen & Adams (2005) were able to obtain analytical model results within 3-10°/o of results from a
continuous simulation model. Adams & Papa (2000) collected all of the theoretical

12

background of the analytical model into a reference book.

Their work then

developed the analytical probability models and highlighted their applicability to storm water design for prediction of total runoff volume, peak flow, water quality, combined sewer overflow and reservoir capacity. Guo (1998) expanded on the

initial work of Adams & Papa (2000) by further developing the analytical model and incorporated additional parameters such as infiltration into the model. Guo ( 1998) also provided the development of the analytical model for peak flows, storm water quality control and flood control. Cost- effective urban storm water system design

was completed with a screening level analytical model by Li & Adams (2000) and Chen & Adams (2004). Analytical model analysis of runoff quality was completed

with simple to use spreadsheet tools by Be hera et al. (2006 ). It was found that the long-term runoff quality control assessment could be accurately determined by analytical models. Analytical models for runoff estimation provide a cost-effective method for

analysing the long term performance of urban drainage systems. Analytical models have been validated by a variety of studies and provide good accuracy, in some cases as accurate as continuous simulation models ( rvS-10°/o). They are regarded

as simple and relatively straight forward to use, with well developed statistical rainfall data basis . Considerable work has been conducted at the University of

Toronto; the works by Guo (1998) and Adams & Papa (2000) forms the main basis of the study. The models to predict total runoff volume and peak flow assume

uniform rainfall and cannot capture all of the catchment parameters. The literature review did not cover the development of analytical models for water quality. Guo

information about their tangible and intangible benefits and costs.

Although the

green roofing industry in North America is not as mature as in certain places in Europe, considerable resources have been spent on researching the benefits of green roofs on both continents (Banting et al., 2005). With the identification of

green roof technology as a BMP, there has been greater interest in their inclusion in urban drainage systems. Green roof research incorporates a wide array of disciplines including soil and horticultural science, civil and construction engineering, architectural and landscape designing, ecology, urban planning and policy development (Currie, 2005). are a variety of benefits to the implementation of green roofs, including: · · · · · · · Energy savings in buildings; Reduction of urban heat island effects Effects on air quality; Effects on health and well-being; Reduction of storm water quantities; Improvement of storm water quality; and Promotion of horticulture and landscaping (Banting et al., 2005).

field research in Ottawa that green roofs reduced the energy requirement for air conditioning by 75°/o. The phenomenon of the "urban heat island" where air over

urban centres is typically warmer than the surrounding areas, can also be reduced by green roofs. A simulation performed by Bass et al. (2002) showed that green

roofs could reduce the urban temperatures byo a: and 2 oC with irrigated green roofs. Using the Urban Forest Effects (UFORE) model, Currie (2005) was able to

show a statistically significant air quality increase with city-wide implementation of green roofs. Green roofs help to offset the habitat lost to development (Gedge &

Kadas, 2005). Economic studies have been conducted to evaluate and quantify the costs and savings of implementing green roofs (Banting et al., 2005; Clark et al.,

2008; Niachou et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2003). The studies show that all of the
benefits provided can produce significant savings for a building. Although not the

main focus of this study, green roofs offer a variety of non-hydrological benefits. Many of these benefits have been studied and found to be significant, providing further support for the usefulness of green roofs.

2.2.1 Hydrological Benefits of Green Roofs
Since roof areas typically comprise 40-50°/o of the impermeable surfaces in urban areas, green roofs can have a large impact on the hydrological response of the drainage system (Dunnett & Kingsbury, 2008). Unlike some other BMPs, green

roofs offer improvements to both the quantity and the quality of storm water runoff. Green roofs are known to retain storm water, delay peak flows and offer The hydrological

filtering effects to improve water quality (Banting et al., 2005).

benefits of green roof technology have been studied in a variety of locations around

15

the world, as shown in the literature reviewed.

Storm water management

implications of green roofs fall into two main categories: quality and quantity. Johnston & Newton (1993) showed that plants have the capability to degrade contaminants by direct intake or by binding them with the plant or roots. Their

study concluded that over 95°/o of cadmium, copper and lead and 16°/o of zinc can be removed from storm water runoff with green roof technology. The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) monitoring of storm water performance of a green roof at York University found that loadings of suspended solids, nitrogen complexes, aluminum, copper, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and most polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were reduced (TRCA, 2006). The green roof at York University in Toronto has an area of approximately 241m 2 , covered with grass and wild flowers, and designed to be light-weight. However, higher levels of

phosphates, metals, cations and anions were found to be leached from the soil medium than the control green roof. Studies in North Carolina by Moran et al. The

study concluded that careful selection of the soil medium should help ensure that naturally occurring compounds are not leached. Due to the soil matrix, plant and

organism relationships, green roofs act as a filter and can improve the water quality. Over the same monitoring season at York University, total runoff volume was reduced by 55°/o and peak flow rates up to 85°/o for storm events < lOmm (TRCA, 2005). Long rain events were found to saturate the green roof decreasing the Results were also affected by the season, Two green roofs

Approximately 32-100°/o of the total rainfall was retained in those constructed green roof (Moran et al., 2003; Moran et al., 2004). Similar to the results obtained at York University, the study found that storm water retention greatly decreased when there was not sufficient time between rain events for the green roof to dry. Storm runoff reduction was decreased by 32-75°/o during consecutive rain events. This indicated that the green roof was partly saturated, thereby reducing its remaining capacity. The effectiveness of green roofs for water detention was found to be highly dependent on the volume and intensity of rainfall. In Sweden, field studies on a small scale green roof with an area of approximately 2m 2 found that 39-62°/o of the rainfall was retained (Bengtsson et al., 2005) and that retention diminishes as the slope of the green roof increases (Bengtsson et al., 2005; Nicholaus et al., 2005). green roofs were established. In Portland, Oregon (Hutchinson et al., 2003), two The results over the 15 month period showed that

water retention ranged from 59-92°/o and favoured warmer weather (Hutchinson et al., 2003). Another American study showed that stress on municipal sewer systems can be reduced by green roofs and 70 to 90°/o of the runoff diverted (Perry, 2003). Experiments at the National Research Council, in Canada, showed that a green roof could delay runoff by up to 1.5 hours and reduce runoff volume by 85°/o (Liu, 2004). In Rio de Janeiro, Kohler et al. (2002) found that an installed green roof

was able to evaporate 60-79°/o of the annual precipitation diverting the water from the sewer systems. Green roofs have therefore been shown to have good storm

water retention and runoff reduction potential.

Effects on the peak flow were also considered in several studies. The peak flow of the green roof at York University was delayed by 4°/o to 88°/o (control roof as 0°/o) (TRCA, 2006). The magnitude of peak flow was also reduced by 46-85°/o. In North Carolina, a green roof delayed peak runoff up to 2 hours and reduced peak flow by

90°/o (Moran et al., 2003; Moran et al., 2004). Table 2-1 summarizes the findings
of research studies on the hydrological performance of green roofs.

The existing literature and studies conducted on green roofs show that they significantly retain and reduce storm water while delaying the time to peak flow. The effectiveness of green roofs has been shown to diminish with longer and consecutive rain events as might be expected. Green roofs also show better results in warmer weather, due to increased evapotranspiration and looser soil density. Most of the studies were conducted at the bench and pilot scale levels and did not consider the entire watershed and downstream dynamics. The next section

examines studies that have considered modelling the hydrological response of single green roofs along with consideration for an entire watershed.

Hydrological Modelling of Green Roofs

The current literature has focused on evaluating the hydrological reaction of single green roofs to rain events. Little research has been conducted on how to predict City and municipal

planners want to know how much storm water can be reduced to determine the benefits from smaller sized storm water infrastructure such as pipes, ponds and outfalls. Combined sewer overflows are also a major problem for some cities and

reducing the magnitude and frequency of combined sewer overflow (CSO) events can greatly reduce environmental impacts. Research in this area is based on predicting the expected runoff and peak flow reduction using a variety of techniques. At Lund University, in Sweden, a Sedum

album green roof was placed in a parking area. The plot area was monitored and a
variety of synthetic rain events were applied over the plot area. Once completed,

the researchers fitted a unit hydrograph (time vs. runoff flow plot) and made comparisons with observed data. The average unit hydrograph, from uniform

rainfall intensities can accurately simulate the green roof response for any slope and rain event (Bengtsson et al., 2005). This unit hydrograph can be used to

model the storm water outflow from a green roof. Using the data from the York University green roof, Banerjee (2004) developed HSP-F's Unit Response Functions (URF). The URFs describe how certain land use

types with and without green roof technology reacts to rain events and how much runoff occurs. The original HSP-F model was first calibrated to meteorological data. Non-green University. roof URFs were developed representing the control roof at York

provided quick results without the use and time resources needed for a full continuous simulation model.

Li (2007) estimated the reduction of CSO storage volume and the cost savings of
implementing green roofs in the City of Toronto. Using the same URF method as

Banting et al. (2005), and using analytical models from Adams & Papa (2000), Li was able to estimate the annual CSO volume. The analytical model, by Li (2007),

was calibrated to an existing continuous simulation model (QQS) under a base scenario and then used to estimate the reduction in storage volume for CSO events. Unit cost savings of implementing green roofs are estimated to range from $570 to

$15,580 per hectare of green roof for the City of Toronto (Li, 2007). This translates
to approximately $2.8 to $78 million in BMPs infrastructure in Toronto (Li, 2007). The study concluded that using the analytical method is suitable for annual runo ff volume calculations and reduces the resources needed to run the City of Toronto continuous simulation model, which requires a long time to develop.

20

The Green Build-out Model (Casey Trees & Limno Tech, 2007) was developed to quantify all of the storm water benefits of trees and green roofs. It is based on the land use areas of the District of Columbia in the US State of Washington and the Mike Urban model (Casey Trees & Limno Tech, 2007). Using a pre-calibrated

continuous simulation model, developed for the District during an earlier project, green roofs and trees were added to the model and scenarios were re-analyzed. The model assumed that only 75°/o of the roof area could be covered with a green roof and that green roofs can be applied to 90°/o of all buildings over 465 square metres. Implementation of green roofs in Washington State was predicted to

reduce combined sewer flows by 16.6°/o to 24.8°/o in various watersheds (Casey Trees & Limno Tech, 2007). The Green Build-out Model found that their intensive

green roof scenario prevented 10°/o of total annual stormwater from entering the system (Casey Trees & Limno Tech, 2007). During the research it was found that

the model was complex and time-consuming to set up and run the various scenarios. A "Mini-model" was developed for planning purposes and was not Unit-area reduction factors (UARF) The Mini-

model found that green roofs can reduce the storm water quantity by 3,685 cubic meters per year per hectare. The methodology used by Banerjee (2004 ), Li (2007) and Casey Trees & Lim no Tech (2007) have several differences and similarities. The work by Banerjee

(2004) used real time monitoring data from an actual green roof to provide calibration data for a CSM. In comparison, Li (2007) and Casey Trees & Lim.,. n o Tech (2007) did not use measurements from a green roof, but instead changed

UARFs is similar to the development of the URFs by Banerjee (2004) and can be used quickly during the planning of future green roof installations. Li (2007) also

concluded that the calibrated analytical model for CSO events is accurate enough for planning purposes. The literature shows that storm water management benefits are achievable on a watershed basis, although the effect is not as dramatic as with individual green roof studies. Strategies and research should focus on the entire sewershed/watershed

to yield the greatest results, since planners are most concerned with implementing green roofs on a watershed basis. Although there are a few studies that determine how the benefits are calculated, there has not been an established method for determining the benefits. It is impractical to perform an experiment over an entire watershed. The most reliable tool currently being employed is the modification of

continuous simulation models with green roof attributes to predict the watershed results. Continuous simulation modelling has been described as time consuming

and data intensive. The level of detail and accuracy provided by this method may not be warranted during the initial planning stages. Analytical tools have been used and validated to determine storm water runoff (Li, 1991; Li & Adams, 1990; Li & Adams, 1993 ; Li & Adams, 1994; Papa et al. , 1997) and reduction of CS O events (Li, 2007) from green roofs on small catchments and areas.

Analytical Probabilistic Models

The development of analytical probabilistic models began with the need to directly solve problems involving urban drainage systems. The probabilistic model involves the statistical analysis of long-term rainfall records. With a long-term record a

probability distribution function (pdf) can be developed (Adams & Papa, 2000). This probability distribution function represents each of the possible rainfall events as a statistical value. For example, with a pdf developed for a certain area, the

24

percentage that a rainfall event exceeds 10 mm or any other amount can be determined. Secondly, a mathematical representation of the rainfall-runoff

transformation is developed and with the pdf of rainfall events, the corresponding pdfs of runoff characteristics are found. probability distribution theory, The process of derivation is based on

which relates the probability distribution of a

dependant random variable to those of the independent variable. The relationship of the independent and dependant variables are expressions of the catchment characteristics and their responses to rainfall. A brief explanation of the

corresponding runoff model development is provided;

however, it is not the

intention of this study to explain in detail the development of probability distribution theory and corresponding analytical models. A more detailed description and

derivation of analytical models is outlined by Guo (1998) and Adams & Papa (2000). 3.1.1 Rainfall Characteristics The main input of the analytical probabilistic model is collected rainfall data. data needs to be manipulated before being used. This

recommendation is to ensure that the IETD is greater than the catchment response time and an IETD of 6 hours is appropriate for urban applications. IETDs between 1 and 6 hours had also been suggested for most urban applications by Adams et al. (1986) . Once the rainfall events have been separated, the volume, duration and

There are several types of pdfs, however work by others (Adams & Papa, 2000; Guo, 1998) has selected an exponential pdf, which using the mathematical constant 'e', as a reasonable match due to the long records of rainfall data that are usually available.

for various locations and IETDs, based on long term rainfall data. A compilation of this data is included in Appendix A for IETD = 1hr. These equations are used as the basis for subsequent model development when discussing the probability of the occurrence of a value taken by a random variable. To obtain a probability, an For

interval must be selected and an integration of the pdf must be performed.

Note that the pdfs outlined in Equations 1, 2 and 3 have a range from 0 to infinity. 3.1.2 Rainfall-Runoff Transformation Mathematical models of physical processes are used to predict outcomes or values of random variables, such as runoff (Adams & Papa, 2000). The runoff is directly

related to the corresponding rainfall event and can be determined using a rainfallrunoff transformation such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Storage,

Treatment, Overflow, Runoff Model (STORM) (Adams & Papa, 2000) . (5)

27

Where

Vr

is the runoff volume (mm), v the rainfall volume (mm), <l> the runoff

coefficient (dimensionless proportionality), and Sd the depression storage (mm). The rainfall event volume is typically an input and is provided by the long-term data set. Depression storage refers to the water that accumulates in surface

depressions and on foliage during a storm (ASCE, 1992). This water is assumed to eventually evaporate following the storm. Although Sd is recognized to be a

function of past rainfall, snowmelt and evaporation (ASCE, 1992), for simplicity it is treated as a spatially and temporally averaged constant based on the land use of the catchment. The model assumes that the full value of depression storage is

available at the beginning of every rain event. Typical depths of depression storage are provided by ASCE (1992). Table 3-1: Values for Depression Storage {ASCE, 1992)

The runoff coefficient is a dimensionless value, which represents a ratio of runoff volume to effective rainfall volume. It accounts for the integrated effects of rainfall interception, infiltration and other abstractions (ASCE, 1992). The runoff coefficient is usually assumed to be spatially and temporally averaged over the entire rainfall event. Considerable variation exists in this parameter. A table of typical runoff

coefficients, by Viessman et al. (1996), is shown in Table 3-2.

Equation 5 is the fundamental basis for the development of the probabilistic analytical model.

It is assumed that <t> and Sd can be determined for a given

catchment and that v is a statistically random variable, thereby making Vr a random variable. Using the meteorological inputs developed earlier as pdfs, the catchment

29

can transform the rainfall volume to runoff volume according to the following relationship, developed by the STORM model:
0

v - { r - cp(v- Sd)

(6)

The system of equations states that the rainfall must exceed the depression storage before any runoff occurs. The runoff is generated as a square hydrograph that is

transformed into runoff instantaneously without change in shape. This assumption is adequate because designers are more interested in the total runoff volume rather than the exact shape of the runoff hydrograph (Adams & Papa, 2000). A flow

diagram of the analytical model is shown in Figure 3-2 and the rainfall-runoff transformation shown in Figure 3-3.

With the previous pdfs developed (Equations 1, 2 & 3) the cumulative distribution function and pdf of runoff volume may be obtained using derived probability distribution theory. The exact details of this development are outlined in Adams & Papa (2000) and Guo ( 1998). The pdf of runoff volume is;

Where 8 is the average annual number of rainfall events, derived from long-term rainfall data for specific locations (Appendix A). Equation 9 is the main equation

that was incorporated into the bulk of the runoff volume calculation and calibration work. Although quite simple it incorporates two important factors, runoff coefficient and depression storage. Once the depth of runoff is known, the corresponding

catchment area provides the calculation to obtain the total volume (V) as shown in Equation 9a.

It should be noted that this model only generates expected average annual runoff

volumes and requires long-term data. The benefit of this simplicity allows all types of users to quickly generate runoff volumes. The equation is easily incorporated

into a spreadsheet program that facilitates the calibration with other models and the determination of runoff volumes. Using Equations 9 & 9a and specific

catchment data, the expected annual runoff volume can be calculated from a catchment. 3.1.3 Peak Flow Peak discharge is the maximum flow rate observed during a storm event. While

total runoff volume describes how much water flows over a given time, the peak discharge describes the maximum instantaneous flow during a storm event.

32

Similar to the analytical models developed for total runoff volumes, peak discharge values can also be determined using derived analytical models. Previous research

by Guo (1998) and others was able to transform a hydrograph to a set of analytical expressions to determine peak flow. The peak flow of a triangular hydrograph can be expressed as: (10)

With the peak discharge rate Qp (mm/hr); runoff volume duration t (hr); and time of concentration t c (hr).

The term t c, time of

concentration, has several definitions; however, a commonly used definition is adopted. The time of concentration is the time required for runoff to travel from

the most remote location of the catchment to the outlet or design point (Guo, 1998). There is a variety of methods to determine t c for a given catchment,

grouped into three categories: empirical equations, velocity methods, and kinematic wave theory models. In this research, the t c of the Highland Creek watershed was estimated by using a velocity method. The velocity method is less complex than

using the kinematic wave theory and provides suitable values for the analytical analysis. The velocity method (also known as the Uplands method) developed by
~\

the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was used to determine travel t ime (Fang et al., 2007; NRCS 1972). The Uplands method determines velocity

The time of concentration for a large watershed can be approximated by summing the tci of the individual sub-catchments within. The general methodology to

determine the tc of the Highland Creek includes the following steps: 1. Choose, by visual inspection, several of the longest routes from a subcatchment map. 2. Determine the tci of each sub-catchment within the route of interest, using the NRCS Velocity method, Equations 11 & 12 3. Determine the total tc by summing the tci from Step 2 for each subcatchment. 4. The catchment t c is the largest value of all the routes examined. The division of sub-catchments is provided in Appendix C and corresponding parameters for the Highland Creek watershed are provided by Aquafor Beech (2004), Appendix F. Using the previously developed rainfall-runoff transformation (Section 3.1.2) and
I

Equation 10, Guo (1998) found that the peak discharge rate can be analytically determined as a set of equations: (13)

where Qp is the peak flow (mm/hr); vis the rainfall event volume (mm); Sd; is the depression storage of the impervious area (mm); h is the fraction of impervious area (unit-less); tis the rainfall event duration (hr); tc is the time of concentration (hr); Sil is the initial losses of the pervious areas (mm); fc is ultimate infiltration capacity (mm/hr); and Sd is the area weighted depression storage of a catchment

water into the soil is measured by using Horton's equations and infiltration rates (Bedient & Huber, 2008). The ultimate infiltration capacity is described as the

infiltration rate once the soil has been saturated with water and typical values are shown in Table 3-4. The soil type varies over a catchment and can be determined from soil maps for various regions.

From the first relation in Equation 13, no flow from the catchment is expected if the rainfall intensity does not exceed the depression storage of the impervious area. This represents a small rainfall where all of the water is caught in pools and other depression storage. Once this depth is exceeded, flow from the catchment is

observed from the remainder of the expressions in Equation 13. Depending on the amount of rainfall, the pervious and/or impervious areas may contribute to the peak flow. The boundaries of the second line of Equation 13 show a situation

36

where the rainfall event has not exceeded the depression storage and the infiltration capacity of the soil. In this situation the pervious areas are not

contributing to the peak flow. Finally, the last expression in Equation 13 shows the scenario when the rainfall event has exceeded a value when both pervious and impervious areas are contributing to peak flow. Further information concerning the probability of peak flow can be found in research by Guo (1998). Using Equation 13 and the calibrated parameters determined earlier, the peak flow from the Highland Creek was determined. The peak flow was calculated for the

base case (no green roofs), 50°/o and 100°/o green roof scenarios based on the input parameters. The reduction in peak flow from the analytical model was compared Aquafor Beech (2004) provided a h't_ d rology update report for This document

calibrated to fit the data found in the Highland Creek hydrology report update. 3 .1.4 Limitations Certain limitations are inherent to the development of the analytical model. ·Rainfall characteristics must be treated as a sample of events from a parent population. This requires a long-term coherent history of rainfall data to approximate. Another assumption is that the rainfall events are independent of one another and stationary. Although rainfall events do depend on weather patterns and are hardly stationary, these assumptions are acceptable and their impacts are small and difficult to quantify (Adams & Papa, 2000). The analytical model and rainfall To account for the

parameters only predict the runoff during non-winter months.

37

runoff during non-winter months, another methodology must be used.

Since the

analytical model is based on statistics, the runoff calculated from Equations 9 and 9b represents an average value. This method is best suited for applications

requiring long-term data as opposed to determining extreme scenarios. Peak flow limitations arise from the development of a hydrograph. In reality a

hydrograph is a complex and unique curve for a specific catchment. The triangular hydrograph also assumes that rainfall intensity is constant over the storm and that the spatial distribution of rainfall over the catchment is uniform. Extrapolating this method over a large watershed area may increase some of the errors. Increasing

the number of individual catchments in the same area may reduce the impact of the uniform assumption. 3.2 URF Method

Although the analytical model can determine the total runoff from a catchment, it would have difficulty modelling a multi-land use catchment. This occurs because

the analytical model requires area-averaged input parameters and does not consider hydraulic mechanics inside the catchment. considering single land uses. Analysis is best done

This total runoff aggregation method can be performed with data from the case study (Highland Creek watershed) as provided by Banerjee (2004) and Maunder (2004).

analytical model was calibrated to the HSP-F model developed by Maunder (2004) and Banerjee (2004). The HSP-F model itself was calibrated using observed runoff data. During calibration with green roof technology, the HSP-F model was able to

match observed annual runoff volume within 2°/o to 10°/o. This represents a good correlation, so a suitable calibration of the analytical model can be performed using the results of the HSP-F CSM. ·Although the analytical model is calibrated to the simulation model (which in turn is calibrated to observed data), the percentage

39

error in matching observed runoff values is not as important as the percentage reduction in runoff from using green roof technology. Figure 3-5: URF Development and Calibration

The URFs developed for the HSP-F model of the Highland Creek are divided into land use types with their own corresponding characteristics. They are defined as

the hydrological response of a hypothetical homogeneous 10 ha test catchment, representing each land use type, soil and connectivity configurations associated with the known set of meteorological conditions. They vary based on soil type, roof leader connection type, footing drains, etc. The types of URFs are listed in Table

3-5 (see Appendix B for full details of the URFs). The original URF modelling also provides details concerning water quality parameters; considered in this research. Table 3-5: Types of URFs (Maunder, 2004)

The existing land use data and watershed catchment plan are provided Appendix B. Each URF, shown in Table 3-5, has an average annual runoff with respect to three different scenarios based on the practical level of implementation on the roof area. The three scenarios include:

no green roofs

· ·

50°/o green roofs 100°/o green roofs

Each scenario is generated with 6 years of annual runoff volume (m 3 ) for each URF, however only the runoff volume for the non-winter months were extracted from the HSP-F model. The analytical model (Equation 9) calculates a depth of runoff and The

when multiplied by an area (Equation 9a) produces the total runoff volume. URF model used a uniform area catchment of 10 ha.

Using Equation 9b, the total

runoff volume for each URF was calculated by varying the runoff coefficient and depression storage. Two runoff coefficients and two depression storage values The

were first selected, representing the pervious and impervious components.

parameters were selected from a list of appropriate values corresponding to the catchment and land use type as outlined in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. The pervious and impervious parameters were averaged based on the percentage of impervious and pervious area. Once the area weighted runoff coefficient and depression

storage (<!> and Sd) were calculated for the base scenario (no green roofs), the other two scenarios were automatically calculated by the inherent change of the roof area (impervious) being converted to a pervious area. simulates the roof's conversion into a green roof. This change in pervious area The method used to determine

the change in pervious area is the same as the HSP-F model and assumes that only

75°/o of roof areas are capable of supporting green roof technology. This represents
a conversion of 37.5°/o and 75°/o respectively of the total roof area to a pervious area. Using this method, the total runoff volume of all three scenarios is generated at once. The calibration requires that all three scenarios be within a reasonable

42

range of the original URF volume.

The calibration process is illustrated in Figure

3-6 and performed following the general steps: 1. Select a typical runoff coefficient for the specific URF based on land use 2. Calculate the corresponding runoff coefficients for the 50°/o and 100°/o green roof cases based on the change in impervious area 3. Select a typical depression storage for the specific URF based on land use 4. Calculated total runoff volume and compare to URF for the 3 scenarios (base,
50°/o and 100°/o green roof)

5. Using best judgment, modify runoff coefficient and depression storage values to obtain better match with all scenarios

The analytical rainfall parameters (Appendix A) for the Highland Creek only predict the runoff volume during the months of March to November (inclusive). Therefore

43

the runoff volumes from the HSP-F/URF model were extracted on a monthly basis and the months of January, February and December were removed from the total. This procedure allowed the total runoff volume from the analytical model to be properly calibrated to the URFs with the same time period. Once the calibration is complete, the percentages of runoff during the months of January, February and December were added back to each analytical URF to generate the final annual total runoff. 3.3.1 Total Annual Runoff Volume Once all of the URFs have a corresponding calibrated analytical URF model, the calibrated parameters (<1> and Sd) can be used to determine the total runoff volume from a watershed. This can be accomplished by obtaining the land use areas for a given watershed and using Equation 9a with the calibrated variables 8 and Sd. The total runoff aggregation method will calculate the total runoff from each URF based on the land use area in the watershed. The aggregation method assumes that the discrete land use types from the URFs approximate real world geography. This

assumption may not properly represent the actual composition and location of land use types within a parcel of land, nor the predictability of runoff for individual land uses. No other losses are assumed to occur during the runoff travel path and

routing and other hydraulic processes are assumed not to occur. This assumption may produce higher total runoff volume values as losses such as evaporation and infiltration along the watershed flow path may occur. Since the analytical model

cannot predict the runoff during winter months, the prorated runoff percentages for the winter months were added. The analytical model cannot estimate the

44

groundwater or stream flow of the hydrological cycle. Baseflow data from the TRCA was obtained and used to determine the final total annual runoff volume. With the total annual runoff volume predicted by the analytical URFs for all three scenarios and the baseflow for the watershed, the percentage reduction due to implementing green roofs with the various scenarios was calculated. Maunder

(2004) used the HSP-F model to predict runoff leaving the Markham Branch and the entire Highland Creek watershed with various levels of green roof implementation. The total runoff volume is summarized in Table 3-6 and was used for comparison to the analytical model.

Application of Calibrated Analytical URFs

The calibrated model and input parameters (<l> and Sd) for the Highland Creek watershed were used to predict the total runoff volume of other watersheds in the Greater Toronto Area. The results were compared to other green roof research

(Banting et al., 2005). The methodology used for the application of the calibrated model is outlined below: 1. Develop calibrated model inputs (see Section 3.3) 2. Obtain runoff volumes and land use composition data for various watersheds in the GTA (Banting et al., 2005)

45

3. If required, remap the land use codes to appropriate calibrated model land use codes by averaging similar land use categories 4. Using Equations 9 and 9b, determine total aggregate runoff with and without green roofs by inputting the area quantities directly into the calibrated model for each watershed 5. Calculate percentage differences of total runoff volume and runoff volume reduction due to green roof technology

The calibrated model inputs were used with Equation 13 to determine the peak flow of the Highland Creek watershed. These results were compared to TRCA studies

and findings. The methodology used to determine the peak flow is outlined below:
1. Develop calibrated model inputs (Section 3.3)

2. Calculate the fraction of impervious (h) area from the land use data provided with the HSP-F model. 3. Calculate area weighted parameters for depression storage (Sd, Sd;, Si!) and ultimate infiltration capacity (fc) from land use data and calibrated inputs. 4. Calculate the catchment time of concentration (tc) using Uplands Velocity Method and the sub-catchment data provide by TRCA. 5. Select a rainfall event volume and duration based on the peak flow data provided by the TRCA. 6. Use Equation 13 and calculated variables to determine the peak flow.

The determination of peak flow was not subjected to calibration and was intended for comparison purposes. The HSP-F model performed a brief peak flow analysis

46

over a six year period.

One of the difficulties in validating the analytical model for

peak flow was the scarcity of observed historic peak discharge data for comparison (Guo, 1998).

CASE STUDY AND RESULTS

This Chapter outlines the case study and calibration of the analytical model to the data of the Highland Creek watershed. The first series of calibrations were

completed to match the URFs and are described in Section 4.1.1. Calculations and comparisons of the annual runoff volume and volume reduction by green roof technology from the calibrated analytical model and HSP-F are outlined in Sections 4.1.2 & 4.1.3. Results using the calibrated model to predict total annual runoff

volume from other watersheds are shown in Section 4.2. Finally, a simple exercise to calculate the peak flow of the Highland Creek was performed and results are shown in Section 4.3. Discussion of the results is included in each section. 4.1 Case Study: Highland Creek Watershed

The Highland Creek watershed is described as an "urban creek" by the TRCA (TRCA, 1999). Approximately 85°/o of the land area is considered urban, making the With over

watershed the most developed in the TRCA's jurisdiction (TRCA, 1999).

75 km of watercourses, the Highland Creek watershed drains an area of 102 km 2 · The watershed boundaries are shown in Figure 4-1.

The Highland Creek watershed was chosen as the case study because a CSM had already been calibrated and developed. The CSM also incorporated the

implementation of green roof technology.

Using the results from the Highland The various calculations and with area-based

Creek CSM, an analytical model was calibrated. comparisons were performed

using a spreadsheet program

determinations from GIS. The calibrated analytical model was used to calculate the total runoff volume and runoff volume reduction from green roof technology implementation on a watershed basis. The results in this chapter are based on the analytical model and tools developed by Adams & Papa (2000) and Guo (1998) and focus on three (3) parameters of interest ,in a hydrologic system: total annual runoff, peak flow and total runoff volume reduction.

49

4.1.1 Calibration of URFs
The calibration consisted of changing the values of model inputs (runoff coefficient
<1> and depression storage, Sd) while trying to produce outputs (total runoff) that

matched a calibrated continuous simulation

model (URF/HSP-F) within

15°/o.

Hydrological models should be calibrated using observed data or post-calibrated data to increase the confidence of the model results (Au, 2007). A simple method was considered for the calibration due to the small amount of field data in the URF/HSP-F model. Typical ranges for the input values (<1>, Sd) were provided in

Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. The URFs obtained from the continuous simulation model URF/HSP-F had runoff volume data for the years 1990-1996. Several of the land use types within the URF model, with respect to the 50°/o and 100°/o green roof scenario, only had runoff volumes for 3 years (1990-1992). The Toronto Downsview weather station was

chosen as it had more than 20 years of collected data, forming a reliable rainfall data set. The rainfall parameters used are summarized in Table 4-1. Parameters

from the Toronto Bloor Street and Ellesmere weather stations were also used with the calibrated model to determine the sensitivity of the parameters. The IETD

duration was selected as 1 hour because the URFs are based on a catchment size of

10 ha, which was calculated to have a time of concentration less than 1 hour.

Complete calibration tables are provided in Appendix D and a summary of the calibrated parameters of <l> and Sd are shown in Table 4-2. It is important to note that the calibrated parameters are area-weighted averages of the pervious and impervious parameters for each URF land use. At the top of Appendix D, the

parameters used are stated, including percentage impervious/pervious, roof area, depression storage and soil types (AB, BC and CD). As stated in the described

methodology, the base parameters for each URF are taken from the master list found in Appendix B. The runoff was then calculated using Equation 9 and

multiplied by the sample area size of 10 ha to produce the annual runoff in cubic metres.

The URF model assumed that no green roofs could be implemented in areas designated as "Open Space" and "Transportation Corridor." analytical model was only calibrated for the base case. For these URFs, the

Overall, the calibrated

runoff coefficients increased in value with increased impervious land use type. The low-density residential runoff coefficients ranged from 0.54 to 0.66 while the highdensity a rea ranged from 0. 91 to 0. 97. The U RFs representing open green space The calibrated runoff

coefficient was higher than expected for the commercial area (base case) and was paired with a small depression storage value. The highest runoff value using the

analytical model occurs if the runoff coefficient was 1.0 and the depression storage was 0. Substituting these two values, the maximum runoff volume was 440 mm

52

per year or 44,000 m 3 of total runoff volume on a 10 ha catchment.

The average

runoff volume predicted by the HSP-F/URF model (Banerjee, 2004) (commercial base case) ranged from 45,222-46,731 m 3 per 10 ha, representing values

impossible to obtain using the analytical model.

This may have occurred because

the analytical parameters for rainfall are statistical long-term averages, obtained from a larger dataset. Since the data in the URF/HSP-F model was based on six Reviewing

years, the years 1990-1996 may have had above average rainfall.

rainfall data from TRCA, the amount of precipitation during the years 1990 to 1996 was 709 mm (TRCA, 2005). This value was higher than average value predicted by the analytical model parameter of 585 mm, thereby increasing the total annual runoff volume in the HSP-F/URF model. This highlights the importance of ensuring an average dataset is available when using the analytical model. Each URF has additional characteristics such as roof leader type, soil type, foundation drainage and ditches. The analytical model is not capable of specifically incorporating these parameters. This is a recognized deficiency of using an Three different

analytical model, but the goal is to keep the calculations simple.

soil types, used in the URF model, are accounted for by using different runoff coefficients. The soil types are classified as AB, BC and CD and lead to three

different total runoff volumes as the soils become progressively more resistant to infiltration. Soil AB is a mix of deep sand, deep/shallow loess, aggregated silts, BC is sandy clay, shallow sandy loam and CD soils have significant portions of clay. This amount of detail is appropriate for planning level purposes. Depression storage followed the same pattern as the runoff coefficients. The less

developed land use types such as open space had higher values ranging from 2-5

53

mm, while commercial and industrial areas had almost no depression storage.

As

can be seen in Table 4-2, the depression storage had a range of values, representing different soil and surface conditions . Most of the calibrated depression storage values were lower than typical values seen in Table 4-1. During the

calibration process, preference was given to selecting the proper runoff coefficient because of the more sensitive relationship of the variable, based on the results of the sensitivity analysis (Section 4.1.4). The runoff coefficient was given calibration priority by having more precision (up to one decimal place). It also represents the physical change in green roof technology and soil conditions and was determined to be more sensitive. The average absolute percentage difference between the calibrated analytical runoff model and the URF runoff is summarized in Table 4-3 for each general land use type. Percentage differences can be seen in the calibration worksheets in Appendix

D.

A good match can be found for all URF types.

When calibrating, a near perfect

match can be made for one of the scenarios, however, the goal was to balance the percentage difference among the three scenarios. The commercial and industrial

runoff values from the URF model are larger than the maximum that the analytical model could predict. This occurred because the precipitation data used during 1990 to 1996 was higher than average. This should not greatly impact the overall runoff volume aggregation due to the smaller percentages of commercial and industrial areas in the Highland Creek watershed. During the calibration process, it was found that the analytical model underpredicted the annual runoff volume when no green roof technology was

implemented, and over-predicted the annual runoff volume when green roofs were implemented. This suggests that changing the roof area to a pervious area, to

represent the implementation of a green roof does not fully account for all the benefits. Factors that might account for this trend include increased infiltration and evaporation from green roofs. The under-prediction produces conservative

estimates when quantifying the runoff reduction when using the analytical model. Changes to the model would be required to account for some of these additional benefits of green roofs . In addition, the CSM has its own inherent differences when modelling flow patterns and paths. Examples include the residential URFs that had roof leaders These URFs

disconnected or use of roadside ditches without storm sewers.

produced runoff values less than half of their counterparts (with roof leaders connected to a storm sewer) when using the same runoff characteristics. For

example, URF # 1001 (low density residential) had a runoff of about 18,200 m 3

55

compared to URF #1019 (low density residential) with a runoff of about 2,645 m 3 in 1990. Both URFs are categorized as low-density residential with an area of 10

hectares, but URF #1019 includes ditches and disconnected roof leaders . It could be reasoned that much higher depression storage occurs with ditches and that the runoff coefficients are lower due to the increased flow paths over pervious areas. URFs with ditches and roof leaders disconnected were not included in the calibrated due to the large difference in runoff coefficient and depression storage. Their calibration was omitted for this applied study because no areas in the Highland Creek HSP-F model were categorized as such and thus they have no impact on the total annual runoff calculation. The Highland Creek also contains the land use types described as AGR, TRY and EIU (agricultural, transportation, educational land uses); however, the URF/HSP-F models did not use this land type. The analytical

model was not calibrated for these land use types and they account for a small percentage of the land use ( < 3°/o). 4.1.2 Total Runoff Volume Land use in the Highland Creek watershed is broken down by smaller watersheds and outlined in Appendix B. The Highland Creek watershed has about 10,574.5 ha according to the original data used in the HSP-F model (Banerjee, 2004). The total runoff volume aggregation method ignores the land use areas that have not been ca librated (described above). Since one of the objectives is to dete rmin e the

relative percentage difference in the reduction of runoff due to green roofs, the small amount of land left un-calibrated does not have a major impact. percentage of area unaccounted for is 5.6°/o and assumed as a small amount. The

56

The total annual runoff determined from the analytical model is summarized in Table 4-4. The calibrated model parameters were combined with the quantities of land use to determine the runoff. This runoff value does not include the runoff

during the months of January, February and December, because the analytical URFs were originally calibrated excluding those months. Therefore, the runoff values

were prorated accordingly by the percentage calculated earlier in Section 4.1.1, Calibration of URFs. The HSP-F model included a component of flow described as

subsurface flow or groundwater flow, which is part of the final total runoff volume at the most downstream part of the watershed. As described earlier, the analytical model (Equations 9 and 9b) does provide a methodology to model the groundwater component of the hydrological cycle. To overcome this shortcoming, average

baseflow data for the Highland Creek from the TRCA was included with the analytical model to determine the final outflows of the watershed. Analytical

rainfall parameters from the Toronto Bloor and Ellesmere weather station were also used with the calibrated model to determine total flow. Table 4-4: Total Runoff Volume for the Analytical and HSP-F Models

The total outflow from the analytical model and HSP-F model show a good match. For comparison purposes, streamflow data from the TRCA for the past 10 years has recorded 35-45 million m 3 of total flow from the Highland Creek Watershed. The

percentage difference between the HSP-F and analytical model range from 0.5°/o to

6°/o across the 3 green roof scenarios. These values could be refined by examining
how to determine and account for the runoff during winter. Although the original

calibration was performed for a period excluding the winter months, the total outflow includes all months. As stated earlier, the runoff during winter months is

simply prorated from the total runoff volume. The runoff volume predicted by the analytical model may also be skewed to higher runoff values, since the initial calibration with the URFs was completed with higher than average rainfall data spanning over 6 years. Ensuring that the URFs are calibrated over a more Using the

representative time period would increase the confidence of the results.

rainfall parameters from other near-by locations, the total annual runoff volume differs by rv5°/o. Although this difference is small, the rainfall parameters should be reviewed to ensure they reflect the geographic location since rainfall can differ greatly within a small region.

4.1.3 Runoff Reduction
The runoff reduction of implementing gree n roofs is shown in Table 4-5. Although

there were a few concerns in developing the total runoff volume (unknown URFs, industrial und er-p rediction) , the calculation of runoff reductio n shou ld dimin ish most of the issues because we are examining the relative differences.

58

Table 4-5: Runoff Reduction (Analytical and HSP-F Models)

HSP-F Model Analytical Model

1.3°/o

2.8°/o 8.0°/o

The analytical model shows a higher percentage of runoff volume reduction. Additional work by Banting et al. (2005) found that the total runoff volume was reduced by 4.12-12.3°/o in a variety of watersheds in the GTA using the URFs developed for Toronto's Wet Weather Flow Study (City of Toronto, 2003). Maunder

(2004) performed an HSP-F model on the Markham Branch of the Highland Creek
and found that the runoff was reduced by 4°/o with green roof technology. The

Green Build-out Model found that their modeled intensive green roof scenario prevented 10°/o of total annual stormwater from entering the system (Casey Trees
& Limno Tech, 2007).

Although others have found that individual green roofs can

retain 32-100°/o of runoff (Kohler et al., 2002; Moran et al., 2003; Moran et al.,

2004; Perry, 2003; Sherman, 2005), the overall watershed effect is lower because
of the small amount of land green roofs occupy in a watershed. Although the

analytical model does not match well with the HSP-F model for runoff reduction, comparison with other research has shown better matches.

4.1.4 Sensitivity Analysis
A simple sensitivity analysis was performed on the analytical model used to predict runoff volumes. The purpose of the analysis was to estimate the rate of change of the model outputs (runoff) with respect to changes in inputs (runoff coefficient <D and depression storage, Sd). The method used was the most common sensitivity

analysis, a sampling based method that involves running the original model for a

59

set of input parameter combinations and determining the sensitivity from the model outputs (Saltelli, 2004). The analytical model or Equation 9 is shown below; (9)

The variables that were calibrated are Sd (depression storage) and <D (runoff coefficient), which are dependent on the catchment. The rainfall characteristics ~

and 8 are constants, which have been tabulated for many major cities and areas in Canada. Due to the simplicity of the model, the sensitivity analysis was not

complex and incorporated a minimum, maximum and sampling analysis while holding one of the variables constant. The runoff coefficient is a unit less measure of the amount of rainfall, in excess of depression storage, that is converted into runoff. Typical values are shown in Table 3-2 and the coefficient has a range from 0 to 1. Assuming that depression storage is a constant over the watershed, the rate of change for the total runoff volume is: (11)

which is a constant value dependent on the statistical rainfall parameters. Figure 4-2 shows the total runoff volume, R, and the effect of varying the runoff coefficient, while holding the depression storage constant (for a range of values). The rate of change is constant as shown in the linearity of t he resulting curves. The result is a direct relationship between the runoff coefficient and total runoff volume; if the run off coefficient doubles, so does the total runoff volume. runoff coefficient is not more sensitive at any value.

The results from the sampling analysis show that a change in runoff coefficient results in a greater change in the total runoff volume than the depression storage. As shown in the rate of change equation for the runoff coefficient, the derivative is a constant value. A 50°/o change in the runoff coefficient results in a 50°/o change

in the total runoff volume. The relationship with depression storage is different. A much larger change in depression storage must occur before an equal change in total runoff volume is observed. 4.2 Application of Calibrated Model

Using Toronto's WWFMMP data and the developed URFs, the reduction of runoff from the implementation of green roof technology was estimated by others (Banting et al., 2005). The predicted runoff with and without green roof technology is summarized in Table 4-7.

The runoff reduction potential of green roofs from this study ranges from 4°/o to

12°/o.

Using the analytical model, the runoff reduction of the Highland Creek was

estimated at 4°/o (50°/o green roofs) and 8°/o (100°/o green roofs) which is within the range of the values developed by Banting et al. (2005) using the 100°/o green roof scenario. The calibrated parameters and the analytical model discussed in this

report were used to predict the total runoff volume and runoff volume reduction from the same watersheds as shown in Table 4-7. comparison are shown in Table 4-8. The final results of this

The results show that the runoff reduction values generated from the calibrated models exceed the data generated for the GTA watersheds. Relatively good

matches were found for the Etobicoke Creek, Inner Harbour & Coatsworth Cut, Lake Ontario, and Rouge watersheds. In general, the analytical model predicted a

greater runoff reduction (11°/o) than the work performed by Banting et al. (2005)

(8°/o). 4.1.3.

This finding is similar to the initial calibration and comparison in Section

65

The reduction percentage for the watersheds of the Don River, Eastern Beaches Tunnel and Waterfront showed a significant difference. It was expected that the

difference in runoff reduction would be smaller, because of the averaging effect of large watersheds in the HSP-F/URF models. One hectare of light residential area in one watershed should behave similar to another one in a nearby watershed. The

remapping of land use codes is one source of error because of the uncertainty of the exact land use designation from that source. In addition, the calibrated

analytical model has built-in parameters that reflect the characteristics of the Highland Creek Watershed. Applying these characteristics to other watersheds may produce results that do not match well. Since there are no other documented

continuous simulations of the other watersheds with green roofs, the comparison of these results should not validate or invalidate the methodology of using an analytical model. As can be seen from the results, both methods are based or

calibrated to the HSP-F/URF model of the Highland Creek and produced different results. 4.3 Peak Flow Analytical Model

To calculate the peak flow from the Highland Creek watershed, the time of concentration (tc) was first determined. Using Equations 11 & 12 and the

methodology described earlier, the t c of the Highland Creek was found to be 8.2 hours. The corresponding peak flows from the analytical model (Equation 13) were then determined for all the storm events provided in the Hydrology Update by Aquafor Beech (2004) (Appendix G). Table 4-9. The results from Equation 13 are shown in

66

The analytical model used to predict peak flow shows a poor correlation to the measured peak flow events of the Highland Creek . The results show a large range of difference due to the crude development of the input parameters and

methodology used in Equation 13. The depression storage and ultimate infiltration capacity are calculated from the area weighted average of the entire catchment. This method does capture how the catchment reacts to peak flow because it is treated as a homogenous parcel of land. The analytical model assumes uniform

rainfall intensity, however none of the rainfall events were uniform (Appendix G). During real storms the rainfall intensity varies over time and space. Several of

these issues could be resolved by further dividing the sub-catchment of the Highland Creek into smaller and finer catchments with specific input parameters; however, this increases the complexity of using the analytical model. Hydraulic

routing of the storm flow is not accounted for in the analytical model; but plays a large role in peak flow determination. Although most of the storms were not

closely matched by the analytical model, peak flow for Storm ID 6 and 7 were

67

relatively close. Analyzing those two storms, the peak flow reduction of green roof implementation was calculated to range from 11 to 20°/o. The peak flow reduction using the analytical model is higher than the 3°/o and 4°/o as predicted by Maunder (2004 ). reduction on a watershed basis. Research is limited on the overall peak flow Other studies have found peak flow reductions

ranging from 46-90°/o from individual green roofs (Moran et al., 2003; Moran et al.,

-· 2004; TRCA, 2005). The underlying basis of the analytical model was to vary the
runoff coefficient or the impervious area assuming that available roof area could be switched to a pervious area. Not enough data from other studies are available to

validate or compare the results obtained from the peak flow runoff reduction. The results of the peak flow may not be accurate results, however the exercise was easy to complete and may still provide a first estimate of peak flow reduction for planning purposes if additional and long-term data is available for calibration.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Urbanization has greatly changed the hydrological cycle and stormwater flow patterns, requiring mitigation measures to accommodate excess runoff from

rainwater, flooding, erosion and water pollution. The design of urban storm water management systems have greatly evolved with the aid of computerized assistance and models. The design process typically involves running continuous simulation

models to predict outputs such as storm runoff volumes, peak flow, water quality parameters, combined sewer overflows etc. During the early stages of urban

stormwater design, the final details of the drainage system have yet to be determined. The amount of effort required to generate a continuous simulation

model based on unknown variables may not be cost effective. An alternative type of modelling can be used for such instances when a preliminary characterization is required for planning purposes. Based primarily on statistics, analytical modelling

can be used during the planning stage of the design. Important parameters during the planning stages for stormwater design include total runoff volume and peak flow for a given catchment. Green roof technology has been identified as a BMP and increased the use of green roofs within urban drainage systems. Various studies on green roofs have found

that they retain and delay stormwater and offer filtering effects to improve water quality. Significant non-hydrological benefits have been studied and identified such as energy savings, air quality improvement and psychological effects, thus

providing further support for usefulness of green roofs.

Green roof research has

mainly focused on evaluating the hydrological reaction of a single green roof to rain

69

events.

The research is limited on how a series of green roofs performs over a This study models the hydrological benefits of green roofs over a

watershed. watershed.

Using the Highland Creek Watershed as a case study, an analytical URF model was developed and calibrated to a CSM (HSP-F) developed by Banerjee (2004). The

original work by Banerjee (2004) also included developing URFs for land use types with green roofs. The URF calibration process involved changing the catchment

parameters of runoff coefficient and depression storage to match total runoff volume. The analytical URF calibrations were successful, with an overall agreement of less than 8°/o difference between the HSP-F model. The calibrated parameters The average

were close to typical values for their corresponding land use.

percentage difference of annual runoff (not including industrial land use) between the HSP-F URFs and analytical URF model ranged from 3. 7°/o to 7 .8°/o. A near

perfect match was made for the runoff scenario of High Density Residential land

(50°/o

green

roof implementation);

however,

the

goal

was

to

balance

the

percentage difference among the three scenarios: base case (no green roof), 50°/o green roofs and 100°/o green roofs. The calibrated analytical URF model and the land use area data of the Highland Creek watershed were used to calculate the annual total runoff volume. Using the

aggregation method a good mat ch was obtained when comparing the aggregate runoff volume of the HSP-F and analytical URF model. The percentage difference

bet we en the analytical and HSP-F model for tot al annua l runo ff (including base flow) from the watershed was 0.5°/o, 3°/o and 6°/o for the three scenarios. For the

total annual runoff volume reduction, the analytical model showed a 4.2°/o and

70

8.0°/o annual runoff reduction with 50°/o and 100°/o green roof implementation,
respectively. The corresponding runoff reductions from the HSP-F model were

1.3°/o and 2.8°/o. Since the annual runoff volume reduction determines the relative
differences between the scenarios, the error and inaccuracies are diminished. Using the calibrated analytical URF parameters, the runoff reductions from

additional watersheds across the GTA were calculated, resulting in a range of 8°/o to

15°/o reduction for the entire region.

Other studies have produced values For example, Banting et al. (2005) reduced by

comparable to the analytical model results. found that the total runoff volume was

4.12°/o-12.3°/o

when

implementing green roofs in a variety of watersheds in the GTA, and Aquafor Beech

(2000) found that the runoff was reduced by 4°/o with green roofs within the
Markham Branch of the Highland Creek. A conclusive statement concerning the

accuracy of the analytical model for runoff volume reduction could not be provided. As indentified earlier, the research on quantifying watershed hydrological benefits of green roofs remains limited. The additional exercise of determining peak flow using analytical tools did not produce results that agreed well with previous studies. This may be due to the This method

does not capture how the catchment reacts to peak flow since the catchment is treated as a homogenous parcel of land. Unlike the runoff estimate, which was

independent of the routing mechanics, the peak flow estimation using analytical models may suffer from averaging catchment properties, uniform rainfall intensity and lack of routing mechanisms. Using observed data and a calibrated simulation

model produced for the Highland Creek Watershed (Aqua for Beech, 2004) as a

71

basis for comparison, the analytical peak flow model showed peak flow reduction of

13-363°/o. Maunder (2004), using the HSP-F model, determined the instantaneous
peak flow volume reduction to be approximately 3°/o and 4°/o using green roof technology. However, the number of available observations was insufficient to

provide rigorous evaluation of the analytical model's results for peak flow reduction. Several key findings of this applied study are presented below: · The analytical model is simple and does not include all the details of the HSP-F/URF model, such as roof leaders and road side ditches. · The percentage difference between the analytical and HSP-F model for total annual runoff (including base flow) from the watershed was 0.5°/o, 3°/o and

6°/o for the three scenarios
· The total annual runoff volume reduction, as predicted by the analytical model showed a 4.2°/o and 8.0°/o annual runoff reduction with 50°/o and

100°/o green roof implementation
· The original URF model was based on 6 years of rainfall/runoff data which is not sufficient for long term statistical analysis of average rainfall events. · The routing mechanics of the HSP-F model and the analytical model differ. Since the analytical model directly transforms the rainfall into runoff, water losses and gains within a watershed is ignored . This impact was minimized in th is study by comparing the total runoff total volume over a yea r and not per event. annua l Routing does not play a significant role when determining the however, it plays a large role during peak f low

72

·

The sensitivity of the analytical model shows that a much larger change in the depression storage parameter must occur before an equal change in total runoff volume is observed. As such, the runoff coefficient was given

calibration priority which may lead to selecting depression storage values outside their normal range. · Results using the peak flow analytical model did not provide good results. There is a lack of observed long-term peak flow data to perform a calibration. This study attempted to calibrate an analytical model based on a CSM to produce results for total runoff volume with reasonable accuracy. After successful

calibration, the model was then used in two applications to determine the total runoff volume and runoff volume reduction due to green roofs. The results indicate that green roof technology could play a role in stormwater management at the watershed level, although the current research is somewhat limited to provide an adequate comparison. To assist future work and research the following

recommendations are provided: · Refinement and/or modification to the analytical model and tools such as incorporating additional details, additional land use types and ensuring all of the area and land use types are included · Future use of the analytical URF model should ensure that the original calibration dataset represents a statistically average sample with sufficient long-term data

The Transportation Highway Comd ors 'A1It be created as a simple IMPLNO·PERLND·R CH RES connection but the ratios of pave ment to ROW may be altered by the indfvidual consultants . A Specia l category was added for the uliunate m flexibility. This will allow the user to create complex areas with these elements. Note that the IMPLND 8004 is the same as the road elements used in all other URFs Eventhough the runs will be executed 'A1th a 15 minute 11mestep, the resu1t1ng data v..;n be stored in hourty format. Thus TSCODE·3, TSTEP=1 , TSFORM=2. TGROUP has been set to 6 (yrs).
