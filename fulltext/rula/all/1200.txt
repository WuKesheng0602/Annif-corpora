Abstract
Development of Enantioselective Intramolecular N-Arylation Reactions for the Desymmetrization of Achiral Dinitrogen Malonamide Derivatives

Acknowledgements

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Russell Viirre for this by Lukasz Porosa Molecular Science Masters of Science 2008, Ryerson University research opportunity. He was instrumental in providing the necessary lab training, and contagious with his passion for organic synthesis. I am most grateful for his expertise, guidance, and encouragement along my graduate journey. I would also like to thank my lab mates Salma AI-Karmi and Henry Galas for their An effective methodology for the enantioselective intramolecular (BuchwaldHartwig) amidation of prochiral dinitrogen malonamide derivatives has been developed in quantitative yield and good enantioselectivities. The best result was obtained based on an enantiopure (R)-MOP/Pd(OAc)2 catalytst system with either Cs2C0 3 or K3P0 4 in refluxing THF affording the 4-methoxybenzyl substituted diamide derivative, 3-methyi-N, 1-bis(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4tetrahydroquinoline-3-carboxamide, in 99°/o yield and 75°/o enantiomeric excess. This example serves as a preliminary example of a desymmetrization of prochiral dinitrogen nucleophiles by preferential N-arylation. The intermolecular version of this reaction proved to be more challenging than its intramolecular counterpart and no coupling products were obtained. Other malonamide derivatives were prepared with a pendant bromovinyl substituent at the a position and cyclized intramolecularly employing a mild Goldberg reaction to form 5-membered rings in good yield and unknown enantioselectivity. moral support and companionship in the lab, Dr. Tim Burrow (UofT), for running NMR spectra prior to our new Spectrometer, and Dr. Alex Young (UofT) for running the MS spectra.

1 INTRODUCTION
1. 1 Asymmetric Synthesis

Asymmetric synthesis may be broadly defined as the synthesis of chiral compounds in the form of a single enantiomer or diastereomer. 1 Many different types of chiral compounds (Fig.1) can be synthesized employing varying asymmetric methodologies.

Chiral compounds may possess either (i) a centre of chirality (typically an asymmetrically substituted tetrahedral carbon atoms) ie. amino acids, (ii) an axis of chirality due to hindered rotation around a single bond most frequently occurring in allenes, biaryls and binaphthyls or (iii) a chiral plane where a substituted planar group of atoms or ring system is bridged by a linker-chain extending into the space above or below this plane restricting rotation in the molecule (Fig.1 ).

The older methods for preparing enantiopure (enantiomeric excess or ee >99°/o) or enantio-enriched compounds include: (i) the classical resolution of a racemic mixture which involved the physical separation of equal mixtures of enantiomers via crystallization as diasteromeric adducts, and (ii) the chiral pool approach where already chiral building blocks, usually found in nature, are transformed into new chiral products. Enantioselective syntheses where only the desired enantiomer is produced are more advantageous than resolution separations of enantiomers, in which at least 50°/o of the product is unused. 2 Methods for the

1.1.1 Enantioselective Catalysis

Enantioselective catalysis is defined as the selective synthesis of chiral compounds in the form of a single enantiomer or diastereomer from achiral reactants with the use of a chiral, non-racemic catalyst complex (Scheme 1 ). 6

In fact, Ryoji Noyori, William Knowles and K. Barry Sharpless shared the Nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery of enantioselective catalysis. Noyori and Knowles were awarded the prized for their work on asymmetric hydrogenations
(Scheme 2, line 1), for example, using enantiopure BINAP (1a) , and Sharpless

The unique active catalyst complex is usually composed of C2 symmetric bidentate ligands (1, 3) with an axially chiral backbone containing two heteroatoms capable of coordination to a transition metal atom. However, unsymmetrical monophosphine ligands like (RJ-MOP (2a) have also been proven effective for certain asymmetric transformations where only one coordination site for a phosphine ligand is available during some of the steps in the catalytic cycle. According the hard-soft Lewis acid-base concept, soft Lewis acids tend to combine with soft Lewis bases and hard Lewis acids tend to combine with hard Lewis bases. For noble metals (soft acids), especially Os, lr, Ru, Pd and Rh coordinating atoms include phosphorus or nitrogen atoms (soft bases) while for other metals (hard acids such as Co, Mn, Ti, 8, Zn) ligands with oxygen or nitrogen atoms (harder bases) are preferred (Scheme 2).

was honored for his work with enantioselective oxidation reactions. 9 Since the Nobel Prize for enantioselective catalysis, a large variety of chiral ligands have been prepared and tested in a number of asymmetric transformations (Fig.2), but only certain classes of these synthetic catalysts are enantioselective over a wide range of mechanistically unrelated asymmetric reactions. The term "privileged ligands" has been therefore applied to certain ligands that are versatile catalysts (2a in Scheme 2). 10 Screening of privileged ligands such as (1 or 2) allow for the discovery of novel enantioselective reactions.

Ligand design involves the tuning of steric (backbone) and electronic (changing donor atoms, Figure 2: 2a-d) properties on the ligands themselves and testing the modified versions for enhanced enantioselectivity. Specifically with axially chiral C2 symmetrical bisphosphines it is known that the narrower the angle of the biaryl backbone upon coordination to a metal centre is known to increase enantioselectivities in certain reactions (Figure 3). 12 Scheme 3: The Preparation of C1-Symmetric Binaphthyl P, X-Heterodonor Ligand (R)-MOP. a) Ph2P(O)H (2 eq.), Pd(OAc)2/dppb (5 mol o/o), ;Pr2NEt, DMSO, 100°C, 14 h; b) 1) 3N NaOH, 2) Mel, K2C0 3 ; c) HSiCIJIEbN, xylene, 120 °C, 3-5

the formation of C-N bonds is of great use for the synthetic organic chemist. One such methodology, the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction has been applied in recent years towards the synthesis of various arylamines found in many antibiotics, natural products and pharmaceuticals, some of which are depicted in the figure below. 15 The arrows in (Fig.6) point to the site where the new C-N bond was formed.

The first example of a palladium-catalyzed aryl amine coupling reported by Migita's group in 1983 was limited to the coupling of aminotin nucleophiles with electronically neutral aryl bromides in the presence of catalytic [( o-toi)3P]2PdCI 2 which gave aniline products in good yield (Scheme 4 ).

The ligand is the most important component of the reaction and with palladium catalysts, phosphine ligands are most compatible. Over the years, various classes of phosphine ligands have been employed in the development of the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction (Figure 7). Starting with the 151 generation of simple triaryl phosphines, followed by a later more effective bisphosphines and concluding with a

However the drawback of this discovery include a narrow reaction scope, limited to aryl bromides, and the use of tin amides which are toxic and moisture sensitive. This work went unnoticed for a decade until Buchwald and Hartwig independently discovered that the addition of a base allowed tin-free C-N couplings. 16 The Buchwald-Hartwig Reaction involves the formation of a new C-N bond via the catalytic palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of an aryl halide and a nitrogen nucleophile. 17 A general Buchwald-Hartwig reaction is depicted in (Scheme 5):

1.2.2.2 Intramolecular Arylation of Amides
In 1999, Buchwald updated his previous protocol for the palladium-catalyzed cyclization of secondary amides or carbamates by employing chelating bidentate phosphine ligands (BINAP, Xanthphos, DPEphos) or ligands with heteroatoms

Scheme 6: First Example of a Catalytic Intramolecular Amination.
In 1997, Buchwald's group investigated Boger's work and further developed the tin-free intramolecular amination reaction, which allows easy access to a wide variety of nitrogen heterocycles. With the right choice of base and a (Ph3P)4Pd catalyst, five, six, and seven-membered nitrogen heterocycles were prepared in good yields. 21 Am ides and sulfonamides were also cyclized with the above methodology, but only to five and six-membered rings.

Reactions using alkylamines allow for a one-pot reaction with no need to isolate the intermediate amide. Advantages include accelerated reaction times, ability to use aryl chlorides in addition to aryl bromides, and use of anilines in addition to alkylamines, extending the range of N-substituted oxindoles that can be prepared.

Carbon-Nitrogen bond forming reactions before the discovery of the palladium catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig include both the Ullmann condensation (coppercatalyzed N-arylation of amines) and the related Goldberg reaction (coppercatalyzed N-arylation of am ides) which predate back to the early 1900's.26 The

traditional Ullmann and Goldberg reactions are depicted below (Scheme 13):

Copper catalysts under the best conditions surveyed were poor with the best yield of 42 o/o with the intramolecular N-arylation reaction. Instead the palladium catalysts were employed for the cyclization of o-bromophenylacetamide as a test substrate (Scheme 12). The monophosphine binaphthyl ligand MOP (80°/o) and the biaryl bulky monophospine Me-Phos (82°/o) with Pd(dba)2 gave the best yields. Interestingly microwave heating in toluene or toluene/acetonitrile somehow deactivated the active Pd(OAc)2/Me-Phos catalyst and failed to give the cyclized oxindoles in contrast to the very good yield obtained by switching to Pd(dba)2. The above reactions suffer from the use of stoichiometric amounts of copper

Later Buchwald disclosed that various commercially available {3-diketones are effective supporting ligands in the copper catalyzed amination reactions. Application of one such ligand allowed the rapid intramolecular amination of aryl bromides at room temperature while aryl chlorides require a longer reaction time and heating at 60°C. It was noted that the reaction of the aryl bromide substrate could undergo cyclization in the absence of a ligand with a reaction time of 3h. On the other hand, the aryl chloride substrate could be diverted towards intermolecular cross-coupling with the addition of an aryl iodide (not shown).

At first glance, there may seem to be little opportunity for enantioselectivity in 1.2.4.1 Heteroatom-Aryl Coupling Buchwald's introduction of bulky, electron-rich a-biphenyl monophosphine ligands (Figure 1O) greatly expanded the reaction scope allowing the formation of an acidic carbon-aryl bond.

It should be noted that although the enantioselective N-allylation (reported in 2002) reaction is not classified as a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction (coupling of an allyl group instead of an aryl group to a nitrogen) it appears that the enantioselective N-a,.Yiation (2005) reaction was modeled after the former enantioselective N-allylation.

Analogous to the previous example using the same chiral ligand (S)-Toi-BINAP, Taguchi in 2002 also reported the first enantioselective allylation of bulky N-[o(tert-butyl)phenyl]amides with allyl acetate to afford axially chiral N-allylanilides in excellent chemical yields (<90°/o ), however with low enantioselectivities (Scheme

We envision the asymmetric intra- and intermolecular Buchwald-Hartwig Narylation of various malonamide derivatives as preliminary literature examples for purposes of accessing existing and novel chiral aryl amines and amides which are valuable structural units found in various natural products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2. 1 Synthesis of Malonamide Precursors
Access to malonamides (3) (Scheme 36, Table 1, entries 12-27) was achieved following standard literature procedures. 64 Diethyl malonate (OEM) (entries 1-2, 5) or diethyl methylmalonate (DEMM) (entries 3-4,6) was deprotonated with sodium hydride and alkylated in good yield with either benzyl bromide (entry 3), 2-bromobenzyl bromide (entries 1, 4-5) or 2,3-dibromopropene (entries 2,6). Diester (1) was saponified and then acidified (cold, to prevent decarboxylation), affording diacid (2) in excellent yield. This was converted to the diacid chloride by treatment with thionyl chloride, and then used directly in the preparation of malonamides (3) (Table 1, entry 12-27) in moderate yields.

the presence of trimethylaluminum (AIMe3) in THF at 40°C for 48h failed to produce the diamide. It is unclear as to why this direct route failed to give the diamide, perhaps could be attributed to the doubly alkylated ester with two bromobenzyl groups at the position sterically restricted the reaction. It should be noted that the literature reaction involved a different malonate and anhydrous DCM was employed. A double alkylated malonamide derivative with 2-bromo-benzylbromide at the a position was also envisioned for a double intramolecular cyclization. However precursors, the dialkylated diester (Table 1, entry 5) which was made in good yield (86%,) failed to hydrolyze to give the corresponding dialkylated diacid. 65 2.2 Intramolecular Aryl Amidation of 2-{2-Bromobenzyl)malonamides In order to optimize the intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig N-arylation reaction of various malonamide derivatives, initial experiments were conducted with the benzyl substituted malonamide using a catalyst system based on racemic BINAP as a cost saving measure and 2-(2'-bromobenzyi)-N,N'-dibenzyl-222

(R)- or (S)-BINAP as ligand in the enantioselective version of the intramolecular

aryl amidation. The reaction gave the same yield as racemic BINAP as expected while the enantiomeric ratio was 4:3 in favour of one enantiomer. The preliminary results show that axially chiral phosphine ligands have enantioselective potential. In an effort to improve the enantioselectivity in the intramolecular aryl amidation, a variety of ligands, solvents and bases were screened with benzylmalonamide as a test substrate. First, as summarized in (Table 3) a small selection of chiral phosphine ligands

In general, bisphosphine ligands have been regarded as more effective than monophosphine ligands in constructing a chiral environment by coordination to a metal and thus enhancing enantioselectivity. 66 In fact, one of the most effective chiral bisphosphine ligands BINAP imparts high enantioselectivity in several asymmetric reactions including rhodium or ruthenium-catalyzed hydrogenation.

failed to give any cyclized product in the reaction (entry 1). It

appears that the phosphinoamino substituent of the 1,1 '-binapthalene framework somehow hinders this reaction. An improvement in enantioselectivity was observed with the BINAP family of ligands. Depending on the type of asymmetric reaction one type of BINAP derivative often gives better enantioselectivities than

coordination site which may play a role in the enhanced enantioselectivities observed. Also, Buchwald found that the (+/-)-MOP ligand was superior relative to BINAP and DPEphos in the intramolecular cyclization of aryl bromides with secondary amides for the formation of seven-membered ring tertiary amides. The second ligating group OMe on MOP is only weakly chelating with palladium, increasing the Pd-P bond length and resulting in an open coordination site. 71 It suggests that

However in this case all three ligands (R)-BINAP, (R)-xylyi-BINAP, (R)-H8-BINAP gave low enantioselectivities (11-13 °/o) {entries 2-4). The other axially chiral bisphosphine ligand, DTBM SEGPHOS 12c with a very narrow dihedral angle also gave poor ee values (entry 5).

bisphosphine ligands are due to their low catalytic acitivity and/or low selectivity toward the intramolecular aryl amidation reaction pathway. Noyori observed that for certain asymmetric reactions, chelating bisphosphine ligands are incompatible with the catalytic reactions where the catalyst can provide only one coordination site for a phosphine ligand during some of the steps in the catalytic cycle (Figure 14). 7 Thus, the chiral monodentate phosphine ligand (R)-MOP is required for the realization of a high level of enantioselectivity and was utilized as the ligand in further optimization experiments.

Table 3. Enantiopure Ligand Screen.

Interestingly, (R)-MOP (entry 7) provided much higher enantioselectivity than the Crsymmetric bisphosphines (entries 2-5). The 44°/o ee enhancement observed with (R)-MOP over (R)-BINAP which gave the best ee of the other bisphosphines screened (entry 7 vs. entry 2), can be attributed to MOP's ability to monocoordinate palladium. It is already known that the C1 symmetric (RJ-MOP ligand allows versatile co-ordination to palladium, acting as a monophosphine or 70 P,C-bidentate ligand in Pd(O)-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions. Also the OMe group could be weakly chelating (P,O-bidentate coordination). In our case it is proposed that (RJ-MOP is monocoordinating to palladium, opening up a

substrate again, revealed that THF was the best solvent in terms of yield and enantioselectivity (entry 1-4 vs. entry 5) while Cs2C03 and K3P04 provided the best balance between yield and enantioselectivity (entry 5 and 9). The lower refluxing reaction temperature (65°C) of THF is attributed to the observed enhancement in enantioslectivity. Another solvent, t-BuOH that was recently reported to be optimal for solubilizing amides and /or deprotonated amides could potentially be screened in the future. 72

For example in refluxing THF, K3P04 appears to give slightly higher ee's with the methyl malonamide 38°/o (KsP04) vs. 26°/o (Cs2C03), whereas the opposite was observed for the 4-methoxybenzyl malonamide where the reaction with Cs 2C0 3 gave a 27°/o ee enhancement over K3P04. No real difference in ee was seen with the 2,6-dimethylphenyl substituted malonamide when either base was employed ie. 22°/o (K2C0 3) vs. 23°/o (Cs2C03). The effect of the nature of the Cs+ or K+ counterion in this reaction is unclear. Also, the reaction of the phenyl malonamide in THF (58°/o ee) was much lower than the identical reaction in toluene (75°/o ee) while the opposite effect was observed with the isopropyl malonamide 70°/o ee in THF and 63°/o ee in toluene (data not shown). The ee for the naphthyl substituted quinolinone (Table 6) could not be determined since the product was isolated as an inseparable mixture of diastereomers due to a new chiral axis arising from restricted rotation about the N-naphthyl axis (Figure 13).

The enantioselective intramolecular vinyl amidation of bromovinyl malonamides was investigated with copper for the formation of lactams. Lautens recently reported a copper catalyzed tandem intramolecular reaction with a bromovinyl group. 15d The reaction undergoes the desired cyclization under Pd/MOP catalysis in low yield (Table 8, entry 5), while the racemic lactam was obtained in good yield under the influence of Cui and racemic 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (Table 7, entry 1). Next, a few enantiopure ligands were screened (Table 8, entry 2-4 ), giving better yields than racemic DACH (entry 3 and 4). The reaction with (R,R)ChxnPyAII was incomplete due to an improper joint seal which lead to solvent evaporation and an incomplete reaction (entry 2). The enantiomeric excess was unable to be determined as both enantiomers of the cyclic lactam had the same retention time with the chiral columns employed.
2.4 Intermolecular Aryl Amidation

After much success with the intramolecular aryl amidation reaction, our attention was shifted towards the intermolecular reaction. Initial experiments between a,adisubstituted benzylamide with various aryl halides involved a screen of a variety of metals sources, ligands, bases and solvents (Table 9). The combinations chosen involve those reported for the coupling of acetamide with various aryl halides with coppe~ 7 (entry 2 and 3) and palladium
73

(entry 1 and 4-9).

Regardless of the metal or ligand employed, couplings with aryl bromides in general were unsuccessful and only starting material was recovered (entry 1,2,5,6). The tetradentate nitrogen ligand ChxnPyAII appeared to give the product by TLC analysis however, without NMR data for this reaction it is not possible to conclude that the arylated product was formed (entry 3). Racemic BINAP gave a mixture of products successfully purified by flash chromatography eluting with 20o/o EtOAc: Hexanes, however the higher Rt spot showed no alkyl protons in the product while the lower Rt spot was not analyzed by NMR for it was

The solvents Ph Me, ACN, 1,4-dioxane, DMSO, and DMF were used straight out of anhydrous bottles. Anhydrous THF was obtained by passage through a bed of activated molecular sieves under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Palladium sources and bases were flushed with nitrogen after each use. All prepared malonamide derivatives were stored in glass vials at room temperature in the dark. Melting points were uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker Spectrometer (Ryerson University) or a 300 MHz Varian Spectrometer (UofT). NMR spectra are referenced to an internal TMS standard or the residual CHCb (7.26 ppm) and CDCb (77.0 ppm) solvent signal.

4 CONCLUSION: As a preliminary literature example, a new approach to enantioselective synthesis with nitrogen nucleophiles (the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling) has been developed through the desymmetrization of prochiral dinitrogen malonamide N, 1-dibenzyl-3-methyl-5-methylidene-2-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxamide · (54). This product was isolated with L-Pro as the ligand as a yellow oil that solidified, in 87 o/o yield (23.7 mg) by method 3.4.3. mp = n.d; TLC (40°/o EtOAc:Hexanes), Rt derivatives via an enantioselective intramolecular arylation. Various reaction conditions were screened and with the optimized reaction conditions consisting of a 1:2 ratio of Pd(OAc)2 (3.3 mol o/o) I (R)-MOP (6.6 mol 0/o) with Cs 2C0 3 or K3P04 in refluxing THF afforded the best results with the 4-methoxybenzyl substituted malonamide in >99°/o yield and 75°/o yield. This enantioselective methodology can be pursued further to synthesize novel biologically active quinolinones. The monophosphine ligands (R)-MOP gave the highest enantioselectivites in comparison to the different types of ligands screened. In contrast to axially chiral bisphosphine ligands, the versatile coordination ability of MOP allows the ligand to monocoordinate palladium leaving an open coordination site believed to be the difference in the much higher enantioselectivites observed. The enantioselective intermolecular N-arylation reaction was attempted but failed to give either a clean reaction or any characterizable products by NMR. A mild Goldberg reaction with
