1. Introduction Letting rt be the short rate, lt be the consol rate, and st = rt -lt be the spread, the two-factor continuous-time model of Schaefer and Schwartz (1984) is dst dlt = µ1 (st , lt )dt + 1 (st , lt )dW1,t = µ2 (st , lt )dt + 2 (st , lt )dW2,t , (1) (2)

where µk (·) and k (·), for k = 1, 2, are unknown drift and diffusion functions, respectively, and W1,t and W2,t are independent standard Wiener processes. Knight et al. (2006) have proposed a semiparametric estimation method for this model, which requires placing linear identifying restrictions on µ1 (·). In this note, we propose a flexible, fully nonparametric estimation method, as well as a procedure for testing parametric specifications of this model. Aside from not placing any restrictive assumptions on the model, our method has the advantage of utilizing local linear (LL) regression, which avoids the well-known boundary bias of local constant (Nadaraya-Watson) regression (Chapman and Pearson, 2000; Fan and Zhang, 2003). 2. Estimation Suppose we have observations {(s , l ), (s2 , l2 ), . . . , (sn , ln )} at dates {t1 = , t2 = 2, . . . , tn = n} on the time interval [0, T ], where  = T /n is the discretization step. Let Y1,i = (s(i+1) - si ), Y2,i = (l(i+1) - li ), X1,i = si , and X2,i = li , for i = 1, . . . , (n - 1). Using a Euler-type approximation, we can rewrite system (1) ­ (2) as  Yk,i  µk (X1,i , X2,i ) + k (X1,i , X2,i ) k,i , k = 1, 2, with E( k,i |X1,i , X2,i ) = 0, Var( k,i |X1,i , X2,i ) = 1, and E ( 1,i 2,i |X1,i , X2,i ) = 0. Since the errors in these equations are uncorrelated, they can efficiently be estimated separately. Here, we propose doing so by applying the method of Fan and Yao (1998) to each equation.1 This method is explained as follows. Suppose the drift function, µk (·), is known and let Rk = [Yk / - µk (X1 , X2 )]2 . Since 2 (x1 , x2 ), an ideal estimate of the squared diffusion function can be found by E(Rk |X1 = x1 , X2 = x2 ) = k regressing Rk,i = [Yk,i / - µk (X1,i , X2,i )]2  on X1,i and X2,i , using LL estimation (see below). In practice, the drift function is unknown, but we can use the following two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we repalce µk (X1,i , X2,i ) in Rk,i with an LL estimate, µ ^k (X1,i , X2,i ), which is obtained as the value of a0 solving

where K (·) is a nonnegative bounded kernel function with K (v )dv = 1, and h1 and h2 are bandwidths, with h1  0, h2  0, and nh1 h2  , as n  . Popular methods of bandwidth selection include plug-in methods and cross-validation; see Fan and Gijbels (1996). In the second stage, the residual-based estimator of the squared diffusion function is found by regressing ^ k,i = [Yk,i / - µ R ^k (X1,i , X2,i )]2  on X1,i and X2,i using LL estimation. That is, at arbitrary evaluation 2 points x1 and x2 , the estimate  ^k (x1 , x2 ) is found as the value of b0 which solves2

where, for k = 1, 2, gk is defined analogously to hk . Fan and Yao (1998) refer to this estimator as adaptive, as it will estimate the squared diffusion function asymptotically as well as the ideal estimator. We compare the finite-sample performance of these estimators in Section 4.
1 Fan and Yao (1998) consider only the case where there is a single regressor. Thus, the LL estimator here will have a slower rate of convergence. However, it is still consistent and asymptotically efficient (Ruppert and Wand, 1994; Fan and Gijbels, 1996). 2 Note that the ideal estimator discussed above is identical to the residual-based estimator, except that R k,i is used in place ^ k,i . of R

3. Specification testing We now consider specification tests of the general parametric model, dst dlt = m1 (st , lt ; 1 )dt + q1 (st , lt ; 1 )dW1,t = m2 (st , lt ; 2 )dt + q2 (st , lt ; 2 )dW2,t ,

where, for k = 1, 2, mk (·), and qk (·) are known functions (which may be linear or non-linear), and k and k are unknown parameter vectors. To test the null hypothesis of correct specification, we use the test of Li (1994) and Zheng (1996), henceforth referred to as the Jn test. Unlike other specification tests used in the literature on continuoustime models, such as the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test of Fan et al. (2001), the Jn test has been shown to be applicable to time-series data (Li, 1999) and insensitive to the choice of bandwidth (Li and Wang, 1998; Kim and Wang, 2006). The Jn test also benefits from use of the wild bootstrap (Li and Wang, 1998), which is more reliable than the ordinary bootstrap when the model errors are heteroskedastic (Liu, 1988).3 Application of the Jn test to the present framework is described below. 3.1. Testing specifications of the drift functions We first consider testing specifications of the drift functions. That is, for k = 1, 2, we wish to test H0
(k )

: µk (st , lt ) = mk (st , lt ; k ) vs. H1

(k )

: µk (st , lt ) = mk (st , lt ; k ).

Note that, in testing specifications of the drift functions, we place no restrictions on the diffusion functions. Our proposed testing procedure, analogous to that of Kim and Wang (2006), who consider specification tests of the drift function in a single-factor model, is as follows: Step 1: Use least squares to estimate Yk,i / = mk (X1,i , X2,i ; k ) + uk,i . ^k , and let u ^k ). Call the resulting estimate  ^k,i = Yk,i / - mk (X1,i , X2,i ;  Step 2: Obtain the test statistic,

Step 3: Construct a bootstrap sample as
 ^k ) + u Yk,i = mk (X1,i , X2,i ;  ^ k,i ,

shown by Li and Wang (1998), even with moderately large samples, the Jn test statistic (given below) does not come close to attaining its asymptotic distribution (standard normal) under the null.

.

Finally, repeating Steps 3 ­ 4 some large number of times, the p-value for the test can be approximated by ( k ) (k ) computing the proportion of times that Jn exceeds Jn . 3.2. Testing specifications of the diffusion functions Analogous to the above, we leave the drift functions unspecified when testing specifications of the diffusion functions. That is, for k = 1, 2, we test H0
(k ) 2 : k (st , lt ) = qk (st , lt ; k ) vs. H1 (k ) 2 : k (st , lt ) = qk (st , lt ; k ),

while leaving µk (·) unspecified. This is done as follows: ^ k,i = [Yk,i / - µ Step 1: For i = 1, . . . , (n - 1), obtain LL estimates µ ^k (X1,i , X2,i ), and let R ^k (X1,i , X2,i )]2 . Step 2: Use least squares to estimate ^ k,i = [qk (X1,i , X2,i ; k )]2 + vk,i , R ^k , and let v ^k )]2 . ^ k,i - [qk (X1,i , X2,i ;  Call the resulting estimate  ^k,i = R Step 3: Obtain the test statistic, Jn , as given in Step 2 of Section 3.1, but with v ^k,i in place of u ^k,i , and g1 and g2 in place of h1 and h2 , respectively. Step 4: Construct a bootstrap sample as
  ^k )]2 + v ^ k,i R = [qk (X1,i , X2,i ;  ^k,i , -1 -1  }n ^k,i }n where {v ^k,i i=1 are obtained through a wild bootstrap resampling scheme from {v i=1 . (k ) ^  in place of R ^ k,i , repeat Steps 2 and 3, calling the test statistic obtained in Step 3 Jn . Step 5: Using R k,i (k )

Here, the p-value for the test is approximated by repeating Steps 4 ­ 5 some large number of times, and (k ) ( k ) computing the proportion of times that Jn exceeds Jn . 4. Monte Carlo experiment In this section, we perform a small Monte Carlo experiment, generating 10,000 samples with n = 1, 000 from the parametric model of Schaefer and Schwartz (1984), dst dlt = 1 (1 - st )dt + 1 dW1,t = 2 (2 - lt )dt + 2 lt dW2,t . (3) (4)

with (1 , 1 , 1 ) = (0.72, -0.01, 0.007) and (2 , 2 , 2 ) = (0.8587, 0.05, 0.03). Here, for k = 1, 2 we set hk = gk = c ^Xk n-1/6 , where c is a constant (specified below) and  ^Xk is the sample standard deviation of Xk . We employ Gaussian kernel functions. Table I shows the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the ideal and residual-based estimators of the diffusion functions for  = 1/52 and  = 1/250 (i.e., weekly and daily observations, respectively) and c = 1 (other choices of c were also used, and the results were qualitatively the same). Overall, the two estimators offer virtually identical performance; the RMSE of the residual-based estimator is consistently just slightly lower than that of the ideal estimator, while the converse is true for the MAE. As expected, daily sampling leads to slightly more accurate estimates than weekly sampling. 3

To asses the size of the Jn test, we test the null hypotheses that the drift and diffusion functions are of the form specified in (3) ­ (4). In order to reduce the computational cost, we skip Step 1 in testing the diffusion functions, and assume that the drift functions are known (i.e., we use the ideal squared residuals, Rk,i ). Here, we focus on the weekly case (i.e.,  = 1/52), but, to better understand the consequences of bandwidth choice, we use c = 0.5, c = 1.0, and c = 1.5. Rejection rates at the 5% level, based on 199 bootstrap replications, are shown in Table II. Table II: Rejection rates for specification tests of the drift and diffusion functions. c 0.5 1.0 1.5 k 1 2 1 2 1 2 Drift 0.0487 0.0514 0.0527 0.0511 0.0529 0.0524 Diffusion 0.0514 0.0512 0.0499 0.0515 0.0499 0.0496

From Table II, it is clear that the actual rejection rates, for both the drift and diffusion functions, are quite close to the nominal level for all values of c. This confirms the results of Li and Wang (1998) and Fan and Wang (2006), who find that the Jn test is not sensitive to the choice of bandwidth. 5. Empirical example We close by applying our proposed methodology to some U.S. Treasury security data, which consists of n = 1, 444 weekly observations, covering the period January 2, 1981 to August 28, 2009. The 3-month secondary market rate is used as the short rate, while the 10-year constant maturity rate is used as the consol rate. Bandwidths are chosen using least-squares cross-validation, and, as above, Gaussian kernel functions are used. Nonparametric estimates of the two-factor model in (1) ­ (2) are plotted in Figure 1. For the parametric specification in (3) - (4), the Jn test statistics are 1.3205, 2.9309, 13.2746, and 10.4073, for the spread drift, consol drift, spread diffusion, and consol diffusion, respectively. Using 999 bootstrap replications, we estimate p-values for these statistics of 0.0561, 0.0050, 0, and 0, respectively. Hence, we can reject all of the restrictions at the 1% level, except that on the spread drift function, which can only be rejected at the 10% level. Thus, this finding can be seen to offer some limited support for the method of Knight et al. (2006), which places a linear restriction on the spread drift function. That being said, our proposed estimation method does offer some increased flexibility, as such a restriction may be more clearly rejected in other datasets. References Chapman, D.A. and N.D.
