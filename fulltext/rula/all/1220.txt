ABSTRACT 
 

INVASIVE AQUATIC PLANTS AND THE AQUARIUM AND ORNAMENTAL POND INDUSTRIES  Master of Applied Science 2011  Shakira Stephanie Elaine Azan   Environmental Applied Science and Management  Ryerson University     The  purpose  of  the  research  was  to  clarify  the  common  traits  of  a  successful  aquatic  invasive  plant.    The  biological  traits  of  aquatic  plants  sold  by  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  stores  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area,  Ontario  were  analysed  using  logistic  regression  analyses  (LRM).    The  multinomial  LRM  successfully  predicts  group  identity  63%  of  the  time,  clearly  differentiating  native  invasive  and  native  non  invasive  from  alien  invasive  (AI),  but  not  alien  non  invasive  (ANI)  from  AI.    In  contrast,  the  binomial  LRM  effectively  discriminates  ANI  from  AI  taxa  77%  of  the  time.    The  variables  that  best  discriminated  between AI and ANI are type of propagation strategies, number of propagation strategies  used,  number  of  dispersal  mechanisms  used,  minimum  temperature,  and  sales  volume  of  aquatic  plants  as  a  proxy  for  introduction.    Recognizing  the  common  traits  of  successful  invaders  allows  for  the  identification  of  ANI  taxa  that  have  the  potential  to  become  invaders, prior to introduction, thus preventing future invasions.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 

1.1  Invasive alien species 
As trade and shipments between and within countries increase, the inclusion of potentially  invasive alien species is of increasing concern.  Invasive alien species (IAS) are species that  are  introduced,  or  distributed  outside  of  their  native  geographical  range  (historical  and  present) and as a result, threaten biological diversity (CBD, 2010).  Consequently, IAS have  been recognised as the second greatest threat to biological diversity globally after habitat  loss (Genovesi, 2009; UNEP, 2010).       IAS  are  mainly  introduced  into  environments  through  direct  and/or  indirect  human  activity.    Raaymakers  (2002)  noted  that  humans  aided  the  process  of  species  dispersal  based  on  their  movements  from  place  to  place  as  well  as  traversing  the  seas,  creating  pathways  for  the  introduction  of  IAS.    These  pathways  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  floating marine debris; recreational and commercial vessels; hitchhiking on humans, their  equipment,  and  ships;  research  and  education;  household  goods,  packaging  material  and  containers; waste materials; biological control agents; agriculture and horticulture; marine  biofouling  (hull  fouling)  and  ballast  water;  and  trade  in  plant  seeds,  pets,  aquaculture,  mariculture, and aquarium species (Carlton, 2001; McNeeley  et  al., 2001;  Wittenberg and  Cock, 2001; Nentwig et al., 2007).     IAS have become established in almost every ecosystem on earth (CBD, 2010).  The success  of  these  invasions  has  been  attributed  to  common  traits  exhibited  by  the  species,  that  is:  they are tolerant to a variety of habitat conditions; grow and reproduce rapidly; have high  dispersal and survival rates; lack natural predators or pests within the new environment;  exhibit phenotypic plasticity; are able to survive on a wide range of food types; have single  parent  reproduction  (asexual  or  vegetative  reproduction);  compete  aggressively  for  food,  water  and  space;  and  are  usually  associated  with  humans  (Williams  and  Meffe,  1998;  Raaymakers, 2002; Sutherland, 2004; ThiÃ©baut, 2007; CBD, 2010).

Even  though  these  traits  are  considered  common  amongst  successful  invaders,  Williams  and  Meffe  (1998,  p.  119)  notes  that  the  traits  were  "mere  generalizations  and  did  not  guarantee  that  an  invader  would  be  highly  successful  and  absence  of  most  of  the  characteristics did not preclude the invasion of a species in a given circumstance."  Other  issues associated with using only these traits to determine future invaders is the fact that  all  species  do  not  behave  in  a  like  manner  (Williams  and  Meffe,  1998)  and  even  if  these  species possessed the traits that favour invasion, they may not become established in the  new  environment  and/or  become  naturalized  species  (Mack,  1996;  Williams  and  Meffe,  1998).      There is also the discrepancy of how many attributes actually make for a successful invader  since some species show most if not all traits, while some show only few (Mack, 1996).  In  addition, the invasive potential of a species may not be attributable to the traits possessed,  but actually to the state of the environment (e.g. disturbed sites) in which it was introduced  (Mack, 1996).  Owing to the continued debate about the traits of a successful invader, one  precautionary  approach  that  has  been  recommended  is  that  a  good  predictor  of  invasiveness  is  whether  or  not  the  species  had  successfully  or  unsuccessfully  invaded  somewhere  else  (CBD,  2010).    For  example,  although  mosquito  fern  (Azolla  pinnata)  has  not been recorded for Canada, and more specifically, Southern Ontario, this aquatic plant is  invasive in New Zealand and has replaced a native species of the same genus (GISD, n.d.a).      Since there appears to be some inconclusiveness in using the traits of successful invaders  on  their  own,  this  research  seeks  to  determine  if  there  is  a  relationship  between  the  presence of biological traits of successful invaders and likelihood of introduction.  There is  a  possibility  that  the  biological  traits  of  successful  invaders  are  codependent  on  their  opportunities for introduction to determine likelihood of invasion success.  For example, if  a  particular  plant  has  traits  that  make  it  a  successful  invader  but  has  a  low  chance  of  introduction  in  the  natural  environment,  then  this  plant  would  be  considered  low  risk  in  comparison to a plant with less favourable traits but has a greater chance for introduction.

Nevertheless, the presence of IAS results in extensive, and in some instances, irreversible  impacts to the environment, public health and the economic sector.  When present, IAS may  alter  the  natural  habitat  and  its  ecological  processes,  displace  native  species,  introduce  pathogens  to  the  ecosystem  as  well  as  the  public  sector,  and  reduce  economic  outputs  in  agriculture, industry, commercial and recreational activities (Raaymakers, 2002; Genovesi,  2009).    For  example,  the  presence  of  water  hyacinth  (Eichhornia  crassipes)  in  basins  and  streams  of  countries  such  as  tropical  Africa  and  Australia  has  impeded  the  navigation  of  local communities on water as well as access to potable water and fish (Genovesi, 2009).     

1.1.1  The Problems with prevention, control and mitigation of IAS 
The  prevention,  control  and  mitigation  of  IAS  are  not  without  problems.    Generally,  in  nature, species distribution is influenced by factors such as evolved dispersal mechanisms,  distance  from  colonizing  sources,  geographic  barriers  (e.g.  landmasses,  water  bodies),  chance,  and  geological  structures  (e.g.  mountains  and  oceans),  which  have  fostered  the  evolution  of  distinctive  regional  biotas  (MacIsaac  et  al.,  2001).    However,  events  such  as  climate  change,  natural  disasters,  and  human  activities  have  been  found  to  facilitate  dispersal  of  species  to  suitable  habitats  that  were,  until  that  time,  beyond  the  species'  natural  dispersal  capabilities  (MacIsaac  et  al.,  2001).    Additionally,  Genovesi  (2009,  p.  3)  notes  that  the  "increasing  rate  of  invasions  is  largely  a  consequence  of  the  continuing  globalisation of economies and the subsequent increase in trade, travel and tourism, which  result  in  IAS  moving  into  new  environments  faster."    Owing  to  the  presence  of  these  pathways,  introductions  of  plants  and  other  species  into  aquatic  environments,  for  example,  will  likely  increase,  and  as  such,  will  prove  difficult  to  prevent,  control,  and/or  mitigate.        As human activities increase in areas such as trade, travel, and tourism, so do the number  of  invasion  pathways  attributed  to  humans.    In  instances  where  these  pathways  are  unknown, undocumented or unresearched, the ability to prevent and control IAS becomes  extremely  difficult.    The  importance  in  knowing  the  pathways  of  IAS  invasions  has  been  described by Leung  et  al. (2006, p. 241), who indicate that "it is critical to forecast where 
3 

 

invasions  will  take  place  and  to  identify  areas  that  act  as  major  sources  for  further  invasions in order to focus management efforts and to reduce the probability of invasion or  the rate of spread."  Leung et al. (2006, pp. 241242) also note that while analysis of specific  single  species  is  important  and  necessary  (e.g.  biology  and  behaviour),  "analyses  of  pathways  allow  the  prediction  of  the  spread  of  multiple  species  and  facilitates  the  forecasting of potential spread before the IAS actually arrive."       Other  problems  associated  with  the  prevention  and  control  of  IAS  have  been  adequately  summarised by Mack et al. (2000, p. 1) who report that  identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and  establishment is a major challenge to ecology, agriculture, aquaculture, horticulture  and pet trades, conservation, and international commerce as the identification of the  general attributes of future invaders has proven difficult; prediction of susceptible  locales for future invasions is even more problematic given the large differences in  trade  among  various  regions  and  in  the  rate  of  arrival  of  potential  invaders;  eradication of established invaders was rare and control efforts varied enormously  in  their  efficacy;  and  prevention  of  invasions  is  much  less  costly  than  postentry  control.    It  is  important  to  note  that  Mack  et  al.  (2000)  highlighted  the  fact  that  identification  of  future  invaders  has  proven  difficult  despite  earlier  research  studies  (e.g.  Baker,  1974;  Bazzaz, 1986; Newsome and Noble, 1986; Ehrlich, 1989; Sutherland, 2004) that have tried  to ascertain the attributes of future and successful invaders.  Accordingly, this research is  important  as  it  strives  to  understand  how  the  biological  traits  that  are  favourable  for  invasion  interacts  with  opportunities  of  introduction  by  considering  a  potentially  important pathway for invasion of IAS aquatic plants (e.g. aquarium and ornamental pond  industries1).   

1.2  Aquatic plant species 
Aquatic  plants  are  one  group  of  organisms  where  the  prevention  and  control  of  IAS  continues  to  be  a  problem.    MacIsaac  et  al.  (2001,  p.  406)  notes  that  "the  frequency  of  species  invasion  problems  in  aquatic  ecosystems,  in  general,  will  likely  continue  to  grow

commensurate  with  enhanced  global  commerce  and  human  exploitation  of  these  communities,  which  may  be  exacerbated  by  natural  changes  to  species  range  owing  to  global  climate  change."    In  terms  of  aquatic  plants,  and  alien  plants  in  general,  human  movement  through  the  centuries  have  contributed  to  their  establishment  in  new  environments.    Aquatic plants were chosen as the focus of this research as some of the most problematic  aquatic  invaders  known  are  aquatic  plants  (e.g.  water  hyacinth)  (Lowe  et  al.,  2004).   Moreover,  the  presence  of  invasive  aquatic  plants  has  resulted  in  large  sums  of  money  being  expended  by  countries  in  order  to  manage  their  impacts.    These  costs  not  only  include  activities  such  as  prevention,  control  and  mitigation,  but  also  indirect  costs  that  result  from  impacts  on  ecological  services  and  commerce.    Furthermore,  these  costs  may  represent  an  underestimation  of  the  true  costs  of  IAS  since  they  have  the  potential  to  disrupt  ecosystem  functions  that  are  damaging  but  are  not  easily  monetized.    Trade  in  aquatic  and  ornamental  plants,  for  example,  has  resulted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (USA) investing a total of US$110 million annually (~$10 million in loss and damages, and  $100  million  in  control  costs)  in  order  to  control  the  invasive  aquatic  plants,  Hydrilla  (Hydrilla  verticillata), water hyacinth, and water lettuce (Pistia  stratiotes) (Pimentel  et  al.,  2000).  In addition, the USA exceeds US$800 million per year in economic costs associated  with the annual damage and/or control of three additional invasive aquatic plants, purple  loosestrife (Lythrum  salicaria), Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum  spicatum), and water  chestnut (Trapa natans) (Pimentel, 2005).      In order to illustrate the financial cost associated with a single aquatic plant species, purple  loosestrife was selected.  Purple loosestrife is an introduced aquatic plant that has resulted  in  the  degradation  of  wetland  habitats  within  the  USA  and  Canada  by  the  production  of  large  monotypic  vegetative  stands.    These  stands  in  turn  reduce  biological  diversity  by  replacing native plant species, thereby eliminating food and cover for wildlife (Malecki  et  al.,  1993;  Liu  et  al.,  2008),  and  affect  decomposition  rates  and  nutrient  recycling  within  wetlands (Liu  et  al., 2008).  Purple loosestrife has resulted in a loss of US$45M in annual  management costs and lost forage value, since the plant is currently found in 42 states of 
5 

 

the  USA  (US  ANS  Task  Force,  2009).    Comparatively,  the  Canadian  provinces  of  Alberta,  Saskatchewan,  and  Ontario  expend  cumulatively  about  CDN$210,000  per  annum  for  the  eradication  and  control  of  purple  loosestrife  (Colautti  et  al.,  2006).    Although  purple  loosestrife  is  also  found  in  Manitoba,  there  have  not  been  any  projected  economic  costs  (Lindgren, 2006).      Aquatic  plants  are  also  introduced  into  new  environments  via  similar  pathways  of  IAS;  these  include:  movement  of  boating  equipment  (e.g.  boats,  anchors,  trailers)  between  waterways, and dumping of live organisms into waterways (Minnesota Sea Grant Program,  1995);  ships'  ballast  water and  hull  fouling  from  ships;  canals;  and releases  from  fishery,  cultivation  and  aquaria  (Mills  et  al.,  1993).    In  general,  aquatic  plants  perform  many  functions  including  providing  shelter  for  fish,  birds,  and  other  wildlife,  protecting  shorelines  from  erosion,  serving  medicinal  purposes  (e.g.  water  lettuce),  providing  fuel  (e.g.  water  hyacinth),  mosquito  control  (e.g.  Azolla)  and  mulching  and  weed  control  (e.g.  water  hyacinth)  (Little,  1979).    When  aquatic  plants  become  invasive,  however,  their  existence can result in negative impacts to one or more ecosystem functions (Raaymakers,  2002) as is true of IAS more generally.    Aquatic plants have been the subject of research studies to determine the traits that have  made  them  successful  invaders  (e.g.  Ashton  and  Mitchell,  1989;  ThiÃ©baut,  2007).   Sutherland (2004) reported that knowing the traits of a successful invader was important  as the knowledge provided greater understanding of the traits that could determine which  species would be invasive, how invasive the species may become, the habitats that may be  invaded  by  the  species,  and  how  could  the  species  be  controlled.    In  the  case  of  aquatic  plants,  Breen  et  al.  (1987)  indicated  that  the  success  of  aquatic  plants  as  invaders  in  any  habitat  reflected  the  plant's  ability  to  adapt  its  morphological,  reproductive,  and  physiological strategies to avoid or overcome competition for the acquisition of resources.      On  the  other  hand,  there  is  uncertainty  as  to  whether  noninvading  aquatic  plants  utilise  the  same  strategies  as  aquatic  invaders  in  the  new  environment;  for  example,  a  non invading  aquatic  plant  may  possess  similar  traits  of  a  successful  invader  but  is  not  an 
6 

 

invader itself.  Accordingly, this uncertainty has initiated a need to better understand the  hierarchy  of  traits  that  will  best  predict  the  invasive  success  of  aquatic  plants  including  aspects  such  as  opportunity  for  introduction.    The  ability  to  discern  which  traits  are  important  in  determining  whether  a  plant  will  become  invasive  or  not,  if  given  the  opportunity for introduction, is another knowledge gap that this research aims to fill.   

1.2.1  Aquatic plants and the aquarium and ornamental pond industries 
Since the biological traits that increase the likely success of invasive aquatic plants may be  different in dissimilar environments (e.g. temperate versus tropical)2, in order to focus the  research  paper,  the  province  of  Ontario,  Canada  was  selected.    Ontario  has  the  highest  numbers  of  invasive  alien  plant  species  in  Canada  (441),  followed  by  Quebec  (395)  and  British  Columbia  (368)  (CFIA,  2008).    In  contrast,  OIPC  (2009)  reported  that  Southern  Ontario  alone  has  approximately  440  invasive  alien  plants.    Even  though  there  is  a  discrepancy as to the exact number of invasive alien plants in Ontario, the CFIA (2008, p.  22)  approximated  that  "0.58  new  invasive  alien  plant  species  has  been  established  in  Canada every year during the last century."      In terms of aquatic plants, 23 alien aquatic plants have been found in Lake Ontario (Mills et  al.,  1993)  while  56  aquatic  plants  in  total  had  been  introduced  to  the  Great  Lakes  region  and inland waters of Ontario as of 1993 (Mills et al., 1993).  Moreover, Liu et al. (2008) and  the  CBCN  (2009)  recorded  an  additional  10  aquatic  plant  species  in  Ontario  waters  that  were  not  previously  recorded  by  Mills  et  al.  (1993).    Examples  of  invasive  aquatic  plants  found  in  Ontario  waterways  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  flowering  rush  (Butomus  umbellatus),  fanwort  or  Cabomba  (Cabomba  caroliniana),  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  and  European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsusranae) (Liu et al., 2008).    In  Ontario,  eight  pathways  were  identified  by  Kerr  et  al.  (2005)  for  the  introduction  of  aquatic  species:  fish  stocking  programmes,  private  aquaculture,  bait  industry,  aquarium

One  example  of  an  aquatic  plant  that  behaves  differently  in  dissimilar  environments  is  giant  Salvinia  (Salvinia  molesta).  In tropical environments, giant  Salvinia doubles in population within two to four days  whereas in temperate environments, the population doubles in 40Â­160 days (Ramakrishnan, 1991).

and  ornamental  pond  industries,  live  food  industry,  recreational  boating,  canals  and  diversions, and commercial shipping.  Of the eight pathways, the aquarium and ornamental  pond industries and recreational boating were identified as sources for the introduction of  aquatic  plants.    Kerr  et  al.  (2005)  further  concluded  that  owing  to  gaps  observed  in  Ontario's  policies  and  legislations  (e.g.  a  relative  lack  of  regulatory  control  and  import  restrictions) one of the pathways of greatest potential for future introduction and spread of  invasive  aquatic  species  was  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries;  as  such,  the  aquarium and ornamental pond industries was selected as the pathway for this research.      Kerr et al. (2005) reported that about 12 exotic plants and animals have been introduced in  the Great Lakes Basin from aquarium releases; however, there were no records indicating  the  total  number  of  introductions  that  have  resulted  from  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  combined.    The  only  other  data  presented  were  the  number  of  aquatic  plants that has been introduced into the Great Lakes (Table 1).  Of note, the proportion of  aquatic plants introduced was 42% of the total, while the second most introduced taxa, fish,  amounted to 18% (Table 1).     Table 1:  Number of aquatic species introduced into Ontario (Mills et al., 1993)  Species  Aquatic plants  Fish  Algae  Molluscs  Crustaceans  Miscellaneous invertebrates  Oligochaetes  Diseases/pathogens  TOTAL  Number of species introduced  59  25  24  14  6  5  3  3  139

Funnell  et  al. (2009) in commentary on the number of alien aquatic plants recorded in the  Great Lakes by Mills  et  al. (1993) emphasized the fact that the aquarium and ornamental  pond industries may not have introduced these plants; however, given the fact that these  plants are widely available through both industries, trade in these plants increased the risk  of  new  introductions  and  spread.    In  the  broader  sense,  Funnell  et  al.  (2009,  p.  105)  indicates that "there is a relative lack of information regarding trends in the aquarium and  water garden industry in Canada."  Provincially, Ontario has minimal statistics available on  the aquarium and ornamental pond industries; however, the impression is that the sector  is rapidly growing (Kerr et al., 2005).      Despite the lack of statistics pertaining to the aquarium and ornamental pond industries,  these  industries  have  resulted  in  the  introduction  of  aquatic  plants  such  as  Cabomba,  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  water  chestnut,  and  European  frogbit  (Mills  et  al.,  1993).    The  presence  of  the  aforementioned  aquatic  invasive  species  has  resulted  in  costs  of  approximately  CDN$500  million  per  year  in  their  control  within  the  Great  Lakes  (CESD,  2001).    Kerr  et  al.  (2005),  quoting  MacIsaac  (2003),  also  reported  that  approximately  CDN$750 million is expended annually to rectify damages to aquatic ecosystems caused by  the presence of aquatic invaders in Canada.  It is important to note that no information has  been  found  regarding  the  economic  costs  of  aquatic  plants  introduced  specifically  by  the  aquarium and ornamental pond industries.  There are several stakeholders associated with  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  who  are  involved  in  the  dissemination  of  information  regarding  the  trade  within  Ontario.    These  stakeholders  are  the  Canadian  Association of Aquarium Clubs (CAOAC), the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council of Canada  (PIJAC), Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH), and Ontario Streams.     

1.3  Rationale for study 
Owing  to  the  increasing  success  of  aquatic  plant  IAS,  one  of  the  questions  that  arise  is:  What makes one aquatic plant a more successful invader than another? More specifically,  what  vital  biological  traits  when  combined  with  opportunities  for  introduction  best  distinguish successful invaders from unsuccessful invaders?  The answer to this question is 
9 

 

important given the fact that several attempts have been made to prepare lists of common  traits  for  successful  invaders  that  could  be  used  to  identify  future  invaders,  especially  in  different taxonomic groups (Mack  et  al., 2000).  Answering this question will contribute to  knowledge of the traits that define a successful invader, especially amongst aquatic plants.      Furthermore, the answers garnered would assist in management efforts being undertaken  to address IAS, more specifically in terms of prevention.  Ricciardi and Rasmussen (1998)  stressed  that  there  is  a  continuous  need  for  research  on  the  identity  of  future  invaders.   Knowing the characteristics of future invaders, they noted, was the best preventative step  against  invasion  threats,  and  should  be  a  common  precedence  amongst  scientists  and  policy makers.  Accordingly, knowing the traits that make one invader more successful than  another  may  allow  strategies  to  be  developed  (e.g.  risk  assessment)  that  would  prevent  and/or  limit  the  introduction  of  species  into  new  environments.    Wittenberg  and  Cock  (2001)  stated  that  risk  assessments  are  to  be  conducted  for  every  proposed  intentional  introduction.  Risk assessment, they suggested, supported the exclusion of species based on  their  perceived  risk  as  well  as  assessed  their  potential  impact  on  species  already  established.  Moreover, the assessments serve to predict whether or not a species is likely  to become established, to be invasive, and to generate a relative ranking of the risk.    

1.4  Purpose and objectives 
The purpose and objectives of the research paper are to understand and analyze what are  the  traits  of  a  successful  aquatic  invader  given  the  fact  that:  1)  there  is  a  problem  using  biological  traits  on  their  own,  2)  there  is  a  possible  relationship  between  traits  and  the  likelihood  for  introduction,  and  3)  unsuccessful  aquatic  plants  may  utilise  the  same  strategies  or  share  the  same  biological  traits  as  invaders  yet  not  become  invasive  themselves.  In order to understand how biological traits contribute to the formation of a  successful  aquatic  invader,  one  has  to  examine  the  morphological,  reproductive  and  physiological  strategies  that  are  employed  by  aquatic  plants  to  be  successful  in  aquatic  environments.    The  research  paper  will  utilise  these  strategies  to  answer  the  following  questions: 
10 

 

1. Do  the  morphological  strategies  of  aquatic  plants  (e.g.  life  form)  sold  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  relate  to  the  likelihood  of  success  as  invaders?   2. Do the reproductive strategies of aquatic plants (e.g. asexual reproduction) sold by  the aquarium and ornamental pond industries relate to the likelihood of success as  invaders?   3. Do the physiological strategies of aquatic plants (e.g. physiological tolerance) sold  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  relate  to  the  likelihood  of  success as invaders?     Given that the aquarium and ornamental pond industries are being examined as the likely  pathways  for  the  introduction  of  aquatic  plant  invaders,  other  research  questions  to  be  answered are:       4. Do the aquarium and ornamental pond industries have the potential to contribute  to  the  success  and/or  failure  of  aquatic  plant  invaders  based  on  the  presence  of  aquatic  plants  with  specific  traits  in  the  trade  that  increase  their  chances  for  introduction and invasion?  5. If these industries do contribute to the success of aquatic plant invaders, what is  the  legislative  framework  within  Ontario  that  governs  the  introduction  of  these  plants and how can it be amended or enforced to sufficiently address the problems  posed by the industries?    The  answers  to  these  questions  are  important  as  they  will  serve  to  complement  the  findings of what makes one aquatic plant invader more successful than the other, and more  specifically,  in  the  formation  of  tools  that  can  serve  as  a  basis  for  the  risk  assessment  proposed as a means of preventing IAS introduction.  In addition, knowledge of the traits of  a successful invader allows different management options to be identified to tackle aquatic  plants in various settings (e.g. tropical versus temperate).      In terms of the aquarium and ornamental pond industries, which have been identified "as  the  highest  risk  of  IAS  introductions"  (Kerr  et  al.,  2005,  p.  25),  knowledge  of  the  traits  of 
11 

 

successful invaders would encourage the use of other aquatic species that can be utilized in  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries,  thereby  reducing  and/or  eliminating  IAS  impacts on the natural environment.  Moreover, species could be traded that would pose a  lesser environmental risk if released or permitted to escape.

2.0  LITERATURE REVIEW 
 

2.1  General Introduction 
Aquatic  plants  are  adapted  to  live  permanently  or  seasonally  in  wet  environments  and  grow partially or completely in water.  Also known as aquatic macrophytes or hydrophytes,  aquatic  plants  can  be  found  as  one  of  three  groups:  emergent,  floatingleaved  or  free  floating and submerged (Lacoul  and Freedman, 2006; Madsen, 2009).  Aquatic plants are  also found to be more species rich in temperate areas than in tropical areas (Crow, 1993).   This paper will focus solely on freshwater aquatic plants.          Aquatic  plants  vary  in  their  ability  to  become  established  in  new  environments  as  they  differ in their capabilities to spread and disperse their propagules (Sculthorpe, 1967).  In  nature,  aquatic  plants  are  dispersed  by  three  vectors:  water  (hydrochory),  wind  (anemphilous),  and  animals  (zoochory);  for  example,  plants  or  propagules  may  be  dispersed by floating seeds and stems, freefloating plants, aerodynamic seeds, hardcoated  seeds  that  survive  animal  digestion,  or  fruits  with  burrs  (Lacoul  and  Freedman,  2006).   Overall, these examples relate to the dispersal mechanisms used by aquatic plants and as  such, may represent likely traits that contribute to the success of aquatic plant invasions.      In general, aquatic plants provide food, serve as a habitat for fish, wildlife and other aquatic  organisms,  stabilize  sediments,  and  improve  water  clarity.    When  aquatic  plants  become  invasive  their  presence  results  in  both  economic  and  ecological  harm.    Ecologically,  invasive  aquatic  plants  may  threaten  the  structure  and  function  of  the  aquatic ecosystem  by reducing dissolved oxygen levels and shading out sunlight necessary for photosynthesis  by submerged plants thus leading to death of other organisms (Schmitz et al., 1993; Catling  et  al., 2003;  Madsen, 2009).  Moreover, invasive aquatic plants can: degrade water quality;  reduce species diversity; change sediment chemistry; increase detritus build up and alter  animal community interactions (Madsen, 2009).  Economically, invasive aquatic plants may  prevent  the  use  of  waterways  for  navigation,  fishing  and  swimming  by  their  prolific  growths, increase the risk of flooding (frequency, duration and intensity), reduce property 
13 

 

value  (Simberloff  et  al.,  1997;  Wilson  et  al.,  2007;  Madsen,  2009),  impair  drinking  water,  and  create  a  habitat  for  insectborne  disease  vectors  that  threatens  public  health  (e.g.  malaria) (Madsen, 2009).    European frogbit, Eurasian watermilfoil and  Cabomba are examples of aquatic plants that  are  ecological  and  economical  nuisances.    Studies  conducted  on  European  frogbit  in  Ontario, Canada and New York State, USA revealed that due to the presence of large free floating  mats  of  intertwined  plants,  European  frogbit  prevents  sunlight  from  getting  to  other submersed aquatic plants below.  As a result, submersed aquatic plants face limited  growth and access to nutrients and dissolved gases (Catling  et  al. 1988; O'Neill, 2007).  In  addition, the change in plant diversity may also affect native aquatic fauna (O'Neill, 2007).   In  the  fall,  European  frogbit  can  break  apart  and  settle  to  the  bottom  of  the  lake.   Subsequently, the breakdown of a large amount of vegetation in the water may lead to the  depletion of oxygen levels and the death of fish and other aquatic organisms (O'Neill, 2007;  OFAH, 2010).  European frogbit also blocks the movement of large fish and diving ducks as  well as recreational uses such as boating and swimming (OFAH, 2010).          Aiken  et  al.  (1979)  reported  that  wherever  Eurasian  watermilfoil  was  located  in  Canada,  species displacement occurred as the stands of Eurasian watermilfoil were often extensive  covering  water  depths  of  1m  to  10m.    In  the  Kawartha  Lakes,  Ontario,  Eurasian  watermilfoil  covered  approximately  80%  of  the  water  surface  (Aiken  et  al.,  1979).   Infestations  of  Eurasian  watermilfoil  affected  human  use  of  waterways  especially  for  recreation,  water  transportation,  and  clogged  potable  water  systems  (Aiken  et  al.,  1979;  White  et  al.,  1993).    These  infestations  were  also  considered  public  safety  and  health  hazards as swimmers could become entangled in the plant's dense stands or these stands  could foster the increase of mosquito populations (Aiken  et  al., 1979;  White  et  al., 1993).   Anopheles  quadrimaculatus is considered the chief vector of malaria in North America and  "prefers  habitats  with  welldeveloped  beds  of  submergent,  floating  leaf,  or  emergent  aquatic  vegetation"  (GISD,  n.d.b);  as  such,  the  extensive  stands  of  Eurasian  watermilfoil  could serve as a habitat for this mosquito.

Cabomba is a persistent, competitive and invasive aquatic plant that has been found to have  significant  impacts  on  aquatic  ecosystems  in  its  introduced  range  (Wilson  et  al.,  2007).     Once  established,  Cabomba  was  found  to  grow  quickly  and  form  dense  populations  that  displaced native species, and affected the use of waterways for industrial, recreational, and  domestic  purposes  (Wilson  et  al.,  2007).    Infestations  of  Cabomba  also  altered  nutrient  regimes  by  efficiently  absorbing  nutrients  (nitrogen  and  phosphorus)  directly  from  the  water  via  its  shoots,  leaves  and  stems  (Wilson  et  al.,  2007).    In  Kasshabog  Lake  near  Peterborough,  Ontario,  Cabomba  affected  over  600  lakefront  cottages,  homes,  and  small  businesses by impeding navigation, discouraging swimming, and altering the aesthetics of  shoreline property (Wilson  et  al., 2007).  Ecologically,  Cabomba may have excluded native  aquatic vegetation, altered water quality, and affected faunal communities and commercial  and sports fisheries.  Moreover, the presence of  Cabomba in the Great Lakes system would  interfere with waterbased industries such as power generation or aquaculture (Wilson  et  al., 2007).     

2.2  Pathways of introduction for aquatic plants  
Although,  aquatic  plants  have  three  main  dispersal  vectors,  namely  water,  wind  and  animals,  humans  are  the  foremost  vectors  for  some  species,  and  are  responsible  for  the  deliberate or accidental introduction of aquatic IAS beyond their natural range (Lacoul and  Freedman,  2006).    The  aquarium  industry,  internet,  mail  parcels/order  catalogues,  and  ornamental  ponds3  have  been  recognised  as  pathways  that  are  used  by  humans  for  the  introduction  of  aquatic  plants  into  new  environments.    It  is  important  to  note  that  even  though the aquarium and ornamental pond industries may use similar aquatic plants, they  are  often  discussed  separately  in  literature.    So,  in  keeping  with  that  tendency,  the  industries will be presented separately in this literature review unless the information was  presented jointly by the author of the paper.

2.2.1  Aquarium industry  
The  aquarium  industry  is  a  pathway  of  concern  for  the  proliferation  and  continued  introduction of IAS into new environments since the trade has the potential to import an  unknown number of species and individuals from around the world as invertebrates, fish,  aquatic plants (marine and freshwater), and other organisms used as pets, displays, or in  education or research (Carlton, 2001).         Elodea  (Elodea  canadensis)  is  one  example  of  an  aquatic  plant  introduced  for  display  purposes.  GISD (n.d.c) reported that  Elodea is "introduced via the trade in live aquarium  plants  and  is  sold  in  garden  centre  shops  as  oxygen  weed  for  private  ponds  to  improve  water  quality  and  pond  scenery."    Elodea  is  also  used  extensively  in  research  studies  relating  to  plant  cellular  structure,  living  protoplasm,  respiration,  photosynthesis,  and  physiological  and  developmental  processes  (Catling  et  al.,  1986).    While  not  invasive  in  Canada,  Elodea  is  considered  a  noxious  weed  in  Europe,  Australia,  Africa,  Asia,  and  New  Zealand  (Washington  State  Department  of  Ecology,  n.d.).    Brazilian  waterweed  (Egeria  densa),  another  aquatic  plant  distributed  by  the  aquarium  industry  is  widely  used  in  teaching botany classes and plant research especially in relation to cytoplasmic streaming  as well as plant physiological and plant chemical research (Catling  et  al., 1986; Lui,  et  al.,  2008).  Owing to the extensive use of  Elodea  and Brazilian waterweed in research studies,  these plants have been widely distributed outside of their native range.  Moreover, they are  now  generally  established  without  cultivation  in  areas  such  as  North  America,  Central  America, Africa, Australia, Europe, and Asia (Cook et al., 1984).        Padilla and Williams (2004) interpreted the Lowe  et  al. (2004) list of invaders to say that  the  aquarium  industry  is  primarily  responsible  for  onethird  of  the  world's  100  worst  invasive  taxa.    Of  this  list,  Padilla  and  Williams  (2004,  p.  133)  reports  that  about  "150  species  of  vertebrates,  invertebrates,  microbes,  and  plants  that  have  invaded  natural  ecosystems  have  been  documented  to  come  from  aquarium  or  ornamental  releases."   Accordingly, Padilla and Williams (2004) noted that the aquarium  industry poses a serious  and unrecognized threat to marine and freshwater ecosystems as a source of aquatic IAS.  
16 

 

Moreover,  the  threat  caused  by  aquarium  species  is  "increasing  as  the  industry  is  unregulated  and  because  of  their  extremely pervasive  dispersal to homes  and businesses  after importation" (Padilla and Williams, 2004, pp. 131132).  Reichard and White (2001, p.  107) also reported that "aquatic weeds introduced for horticulture or private aquaria are  often  overlooked  by  persons  focusing  on  the  larger  terrestrial  plant  trade,  even  though  aquatic  weeds  are  considered  a  critical  pathway  of  pest  species  introductions."   Additionally, "because of the interconnected nature of aquatic systems, aquatic species can  spread quickly, and can become very expensive to control" (Reichard and White, 2001, p.  107).      In  retrospect,  the  likely  outcomes  of  aquarium  species  are  determined  by  the  consumers  who  use  and  dispose  of  aquatic  plants  in  an  unregulated  manner;  for  example,  species  distributed  by  the  aquarium  trade  can  enter  the  natural  environment  via  dumping  of  unwanted organisms, escape from tanks, and the drainage of water containing organisms  from tanks and public aquariums (Wittenberg and Cock, 2001; Padilla and Williams, 2004).   Aquatic species such as  Cabomba, water moss (Salvinia spp.), mosquito fern, parrot feather  (Myriophyllum  aquaticum),  and  Brazilian  waterweed,  are  examples  of  plants  that  are  generally  distributed  by  the  aquarium  trade  that  may  have  entered  waterways  via  the  dumping  of  aquarium  contents  (Lui  et  al.,  2008).    Reichard  and  White  (2001)  also  noted  that  the  aquarium  trade  was  responsible  for  the  introduction  of  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  which  has  been  considered  the  "most  troublesome  aquatic  invader  in  North  America"  (Claudi et al., 2002, p. 35).       It  is  important  to  note  that  there  are  some  arguments  as  to  the  actual  pathway  of  introduction  of  Eurasian  watermilfoil  in  the  Great  Lakes  Basin.    Mills  et  al.  (1993,  p.  27)  reports  that,  Eurasian  watermilfoil  "most  likely  entered  the  Great  Lakes  Basin  through  aquarium  release  and  transport  in  (ballast  water)  or  attached  to  boats  and  ships."    The  hypothesis postulated by Mills  et  al. (1993) regarding the source of Eurasian watermilfoil  introduction  was  also  supported  by  Aiken  et  al.  (1979)  and  Lui  et  al.  (2008).    However,  Westbrooks  (1998)  indicated  that  Eurasian  watermilfoil  had  spread  to  Canada  from  the  USA  in  water  currents  and  by  aquarists  and  motorboats.    Notwithstanding  the  source  of 
17 

 

introduction  of  Eurasian  watermilfoil  into  the  Great  Lakes  Basin  (e.g.  aquarium  release,  ballast water, or attached to boats or ships), this aquatic invader is considered a nuisance  plant in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia (White et al., 1993).    Aside from  Cabomba, water moss, mosquito fern, parrot feather, and Brazilian waterweed,  other  submerged  aquatic  plants  of  the  genera  Sagittaria  sp.,  Vallisneria  sp.,  Lagarosiphon  sp.,  Ceratophyllum  sp.,  Myriophyllum sp., and  Limnophilia sp. were found to be mainly used  in the aquarium trade (Sculthorpe, 1967; Pieterse and Murray, 1990).  Moreover, emergent  and amphibious species that are able to tolerate complete immersion are used.  Examples  of these plants are:  Acorus sp.,  Bacopa sp.,  Cardamine sp.,  Cryptocoryne sp.,  Echinodorus sp.,  Heteranthera  sp.,  Hygrophila  sp.,  Lagenandra  sp.,  Micranthemum  sp.,  Nomaphila  sp.,  Rorippa sp., Samolus sp., and Synnema sp. (Sculthorpe, 1967; Pieterse and Murray, 1990).    The  invasion  of  Caulerpa  taxifolia  is  a  famous  example  of  an  escapee  from  an  aquarium.   Caulerpa, also known as the death weed, was introduced to the Mediterranean, probably as  a waste from the Monaco Aquarium (Lowe  et  al., 2004).  This strain of  Caulerpa  was found  to tolerate colder waters and was a hardier clone of the original tropical seaweed (Lowe  et  al.,  2004).    Caulerpa  became  a  serious  threat  to  native  marine  flora  and  fauna  as  small  fragments of the plant were found to readily survive and grow into new plants vegetatively,  smother  seagrass  beds  (Lowe  et  al.,  2004)  and  reduce  fishery  resources  (GISP,  2004).   Caulerpa has been regarded as one of the 100 worst invaders based on the plant's impact  on biological diversity (Lowe  et  al., 2004).  Padilla and Williams (2004) noted that control  of  Caulerpa  has been ineffective especially in relation to the import, possession, or trade of  this alga as the species continues to be distributed by aquarium stores.           In  Canada,  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  has  been  recognised  as  the  source  for  intentional  and  unintentional  release  of  aquatic  organisms  such  as  fish,  invertebrates,  amphibians,  reptiles,  and  plants  (CCFAM,  2004).    The  authors  noted  that  although a majority of the species introduced for aquariums are tropical and do not survive  Canadian winters, there are widespread examples of species that have been introduced and  spread  as  a  result  of  aquarium  releases.    Of  increased  concern  is  the  fact  that  there  are 
18 

 

hardly  any  steps  being  taken  to  address  aquarium  releases  and  the  aquarium  industry  remains largely unregulated.  In addition, there is limited enforcement to prevent the illegal  release  of  any  aquatic  organism  into  the  wild  (CCFAM,  2004).    There  are  also  "very  few  regulations that specifically address the concerns associated with introductions of aquatic  organisms  from  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries"  (CCFAM,  2004,  p.  14).   Other  concerns  reported  by  the  authors  include  the  fact  that  temperate  species  are  available  in  the  trade,  the  internet  allows  for  long  range  movement  of  plants  used  in  ornamental  ponds,  and  there  is  the  potential  introduction  of  pathogens  with  aquarium  organisms (CCFAM, 2004).       In  Ontario,  Canada,  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  have  also  been  recognised as the perpetrators for the continued introduction and spread of IAS.  Funnell et  al. (2009) surveyed 525 pet stores and garden centres in the major cities of Ontario as well  as  their  surrounding  regions  in  the  Lake  Ontario  basin.    Based  on  the  frequency  of  occurrences  for  known  IAS  generated  by  the  OFAH  and  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  (MNR), Cabomba was identified as the most common invasive aquatic plant sold (Funnell et  al.,  2009).    Other  invasive  plants  recorded  during  the  survey  included  yellow  iris  (Iris  pseudacorus),  flowering  rush,  water  hyacinth,  water  lettuce,  Hydrilla,  water  moss,  parrot  feather,  water  soldier  (Stratiotes  aloides),  yellow  floating  heart  (Nymphoides  peltata)  and  Eurasian watermilfoil.  Funnell et al. (2009) also noted that while some of the plant species  found  were  already  established  in  Ontario  (e.g.  Cabomba),  others  were  not,  and  posed  a  considerable  threat  of  invasion  or  had  the  potential  to  become  invasive  since  they  were  found  in  isolated  populations  (e.g.  floating  heart,  parrot  feather,  water  lettuce  and  water  soldier).          Marson  et  al. (2009a) also conducted a survey of about 917 aquarium owners in Ontario.   From  the  survey,  eight  invasive  aquatic  plants  on  the  Global  Invasive  Species  Database  were  sold  by  aquarium  owners.    These  species  were:  Brazilian  waterweed,  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  Cabomba,  Hydrilla,  water  fern,  water  hyacinth,  parrot  feather,  and  water  lettuce.  Given the presence of the aforementioned species, Marson et al. (2009a) concluded  that  the  aquarium  trade  may  serve  as  a  pathway  for  the  introduction  of  invasive  aquatic 
19 

 

species  into  Canadian  freshwaters.    In  addition,  Marson  et  al.  (2009a)  concluded  that  the  use of risk assessment studies would assist in providing information on the probability of  invasive species to survive in Canadian ecosystems as well as the level of disturbance that  would  be  expected  in  the  event  there  were  successful  introductions  of  invasive  aquatic  species from this pathway.       Cohen  et  al.  (2007),  recognizing  that  the  aquarium  trade  is  a  common  pathway  for  non indigenous  plants,  attempted  to  quantify  the  propagule  pressure  as  an  invasion  pathway  from each plant species introduced.  Using the aquarium plant trade in Montreal, Canada,  Cohen  et  al.  (2007)  discovered  that  there  were  thousands  of  nonindigenous  plant  propagules  being  introduced  annually  to  the  St  Lawrence  Seaway,  through  the  Montreal  aquarium  trade  alone.    This  determination  was  achieved  by:  approximating  the  total  amount of propagules of each species that use a particular pathway/year, determining the  transition probability between each step, and converting this data into a value of propagule  pressure for each species by means of Bayesian statistical analysis (Figures 1 and 2).      First,  an  assumption  was  made  that  all  plants  ordered  from  a  distributor  are  sold  and  is  therefore equal to the number of plants purchased/year.  The total amount of propagules  for  each  species  used  by  a  particular  pathway/year  was  achieved  by  obtaining  copies  of  invoices from  distributors,  as well  as the  quantity  of  each  species  sold/year  by  aquarium  stores.  The stores were divided into two: those that provided quantities for each species  (12) and those that were able to report the total number of plants sold/year (4).  Data from  the  12  stores  were  used  to  estimate  the  proportion  of  each  individual  species  sold/year  (Step 1 in Figure 1 and Figure 2).  This data, in conjunction with the total plants sold/year  were used to determine species specific propagule pressures (Step 2 in Figure 1 and Figure  2).  The proportion of plants entering each disposal subpathway was also identified using  a customer survey.  Eight types of disposal subpathways were reported: garbage, return to  store, left on the street, flush down the toilet, return to the wild, and backyard burial (Steps  3 in Figure 1).  These eight pathways were later divided into four major pathways: direct,  waste, storm, and other.

22 

 

The  survey  data  were  then  used  to  estimate  behaviour  probabilities  for  the  aquarium  owners through each disposal subpathway into the St. Lawrence (Step 4 in Figure 1).  The  probabilities  were  estimated  using  Bayesian  statistics,  specifically,  multinomial  distribution.    From  the  observed  number  of  individuals  using  each  disposal  pathway,  a  posterior  probability  distribution  was  obtained.    Subsequently,  the  proportion  entering  each  disposal  subpathway  was  multiplied  by  the  probability  of  introduction  associated  with that particular subway, then summed across the subpathways, and finally multiplied  by  the  total  number  of  plants  sold/year.    This  final  figure  represented  the  propagule  pressure  in  the  St.  Lawrence  (Step  5  in  Figure  1).    Cohen  et  al.  (2007)  reported  that  Brazilian waterweed and  Cabomba were the two aquatic invaders found with the highest  measured propagule pressure.  In addition, the actual number of plants introduced would  probably depend on the characteristics of the species (e.g. growth and reproductive rate)  and whether the plant was able to survive in the new environment.    The invasion risk of macrophytes, fish, and molluscs sold by the aquarium industry on the  Great  Lakes  was  investigated  by  Rixon  et  al.  (2005).    In  the  study,  several  criteria  were  used:  biological  (i.e.  temperature  tolerance  of  the  vegetative  plant  and  overwintering  ability  imparted  by  vegetative  propagules  for  plants  and  a  survivorship  below  5.5Â°C  for  fish),  invasion  history,  and  propagule  pressure.    Frequency  of  occurrence  was  used  as  a  proxy  for  propagule  pressure.    Twenty  aquarium  and  pet  stores  were  surveyed  in  close  proximity  to  Lake  Erie  and  Lake  Ontario;  namely:  Macomb  County,  Michigan  (USA),  and  Windsor, Belle River, Leamington, Guelph, Elgin [sic], St. Thomas, Kitchener, and Toronto  (Ontario,  Canada).    Species  found  in  more  than  20%  of  the  stores  surveyed  were  considered  high  risk  invaders.    Modified  filter  models  from  Ricciardi  and  Rasmussen  (1998) and Kolar and Lodge (2002) were used to predict the species that had the potential  to  establish  populations.    Of  note,  the  modified  model  from  Kolar  and  Lodge  (2002)  was  used  for  fish  species  while  the  Ricciardi  and  Rasmussen  (1998)  model  was  used  for  macrophytes (Figure 3).  The findings of the latter will be presented here.

Of the 66 plant taxa identified in the survey, eight plant species had the potential to survive  in the Great Lakes based on their overwintering capabilities, thermal tolerances, invasion  histories,  and  opportunities  for  introduction.    These  species  were:  Vallisneria  americana,  coontail or hornwort (Ceratophyllum  demersum),  Cabomba,  Hygrophila  polysperma, parrot  feather,  Myriophyllum  heterophyllum,  and  Brazilian  waterweed.    Cabomba  has  already  invaded  the  Great  Lakes  and  coontail  or  hornwort  and  Vallisneria  americana  are  native  species.  Of the four remaining species,  Myriophyllum  heterophyllum  was considered a low  risk species since the frequency of occurrence in the survey was low.      Rixon  et  al. (2005) also indicated that there were two reasons why invasion threats from  the  aquarium  industry  would  increase  with  time.    First,  was  the  fact  that  the  group  of  potential invaders would continue to expand since the industry was always looking for new  species  that  would  be  popular  in  the  market.    Second,  most  species  being  used  in  the  industry are of tropical and subtropical origin and with an increase in climatic warming,  the  likelihood  of  these  species  becoming  established  in  the  Great  Lakes  should  increase.   Rixon et al. (2005) also noted that given the presence of these highrisk invaders, practices  of the aquarium industry, and other pathways of invasions into the Great Lakes and other  aquatic ecosystems should be addressed (e.g. trade restrictions on sale).              

2.2.2  Internet, mail parcels/order catalogues  
The internet and mail parcels/order catalogues have also been identified as a pathway for  the  introduction  of  taxa  for  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds.    Kay  and  Hoyle  (2001)  reported  that  aquarium  species  are  mostly  available  through  mail  order  and  over  the  internet.    GISP  (2004)  concurred,  noting  that  with  the  growth  of  internet  mail  ordering  services, aquatic organisms and foreign seeds have also become widely available, especially  via internet sites.  GISP (2004) further noted that the use of international mail parcels has  made  the  aquarium  trade  a  worldwide  business  as  parcels  containing  aquarium  species  have  increased  by  over  30%  in  recent  years,  and  are  increasingly  shipped  by  express  courier companies.  In terms of aquatic plants, Maki and Galatowitsch (2004) indicated that  mail  order  catalogues  and  the  internet  has  not  only  resulted  in  improved  transport  of  aquatic  plants  but  has  also  contributed  to  their  increased  sales.    Consequently,  aquatic 
25 

 

plants  are  repeatedly  introduced,  sometimes  on  a  large  scale,  into  new  locales,  which  increases the potential of the introduced plant to become invasive.      In order to determine the role played by the internet and mail order in the distribution of  invasive  aquatic  plants,  Kay  and  Hoyle  (2001)  conducted  a  survey  of  the  internet  over  a  three year period, to determine the number of sites offering aquatic plants for exchange or  sale,  and  mail  order  catalogues  of  nurseries  and  supply  houses  that  sold  aquatic  plants.   From the survey, Kay and Hoyle (2001, p. 88) observed that "with the advent of consumer  access to the internet and the development of ecommerce, the spread of invasive aquatic  plants  has  been  made  worse  worldwide  ...  as  there  were  numerous  listings  in  online  nursery catalogues as well as hobbyist groups selling or swapping aquatic invasive plants."   Some  of  the  plants  found  included  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  Brazilian  waterweed,  water  hyacinth,  purple  loosestrife,  water  lettuce,  giant  Salvinia,  mosquito  fern,  parrot  feather,  Hydrilla,  alligator  weed  (Alternanthera  philoxeroides),  African  waterweed  (Lagarosiphon  major),  and  water  chestnut  amongst  others.    Owing  to  the  availability  of  the  aforesaid  invasive aquatic plants over the internet and through mail order catalogues, Kay and Hoyle  (2001) stressed the significant concerns that should be raised about the likely impacts that  these sources would have on the introduction, distribution, and spread of aquatic invasive  plants  worldwide.    Conversely,  Marson  et  al.  (2009a,  b)  found  that  few  persons  used  the  internet or mail parcels/order catalogues as a source for invasive aquatic plants.  Thus, the  internet  and  mail  parcels/order  catalogues  may  not  play  as  important  a  role  in  the  distribution of invasive aquatic plants as perceived by other authors.            Even  though  Kay  and  Hoyle  (2001)  focused  on  the  internet  and  mail  order  catalogues  as  avenues for the introduction of invasive aquatic plants, they also noted that hobbyists and  aquarists  often  disposed  of  unwanted  aquatic  plants  improperly  into  ponds,  streams,  ditches, and lakes rather than destroying the plants; thus making hobbyists and aquarists  an  important  vector  for  the  distribution  and  spread  of  invasive  aquatic  plants  (Kay  and  Hoyle, 2001).   In addition, Kay and Hoyle (2001) indicated that the exchange and purchase  of aquatic plants amongst aquarium and water garden hobbyists posed a serious threat to 

26 

 

inland  water  resources  as  well  as  encouraged  the  probability  for  the  release  of  invasive  aquatic plants.      

2.2.3  Ornamental ponds  
Water  gardens,  Kay  (2000)  reported,  have  increased  in  popularity  in  arboreta,  botanical  gardens,  and  backyard  gardens  due  to  the  arrival  of  hobbyist  magazines,  mail  order  catalogues, internet sales, and propagation information, that encourage the use of invasive  aquatic plants.  Maki and Galatowitsch (2004) noted that the horticultural trade can assist  in the longrange movement of invasive aquatic plants that are banned and those that are  not.  Furthermore, "the extent to which horticultural trade may contribute to expanding the  distribution  of  aquatic  plants  needs  to  be  more  comprehensively  characterized  to  contribute  to  improved  risk  assessment;  in  particular,  the  rate  at  which  known  invasive  aquatic plants are sold regardless of a country's regulations" (Maki and Galatowitsch, 2004,  p. 390).    In  a  survey  conducted  on  the  water  garden  industry  (~752  water  garden  owners)  in  Ontario, Canada, Marson  et  al. (2009b) concluded that at least eight aquatic plant species  have been introduced that were  either invasive or posed a significant threat of becoming   an  IAS.    These  species  were  European  frogbit,  Cabomba,  yellow  floating  heart,  flowering  rush,  parrot  feather,  water  hyacinth,  water  lettuce,  and  water  fern  (Salvinia  minima).   Marson  et  al.  (2009b)  further  noted  that  although  the  use  of  invasive  aquatic  plants  in  water  gardens  did  not  automatically  result  in  introductions  into  new  environments,  it  is  important to recognize that these species pose a threat if released accidentally (e.g. during  natural disasters such as a flood) or deliberately into areas that are IAS free.  Accordingly,  Marson  et  al.  (2009b)  concluded  that  the  water  garden  should  not  be  disregarded  as  a  pathway for the introduction of invasive aquatic species into Canadian freshwaters.   The  water  hyacinth  has  been  regarded  as  one  of  the  worst  aquatic  plant  invaders  in  the  world  (Riemer,  1984;  Lowe  et  al.,  2004)  and  is  a  prime  example  of  an  aquatic  plant  introduced  for  water  gardens.    Tabitha  et  al.  (1962)  indicated  that  water  hyacinth  was 
27 

 

introduced to Florida in 1884 by a visitor returning from an exposition in New Orleans who  placed the plant in a lawn fountain on the banks of the St. Johns River Basin near Palatka.   The plant grew rapidly and the excess was thrown into the river.  Subsequently, the water  hyacinth  spread  to  all  inland  waters  within  the  state.    Lowe  et  al.  (2004)  described  the  biology  and  impacts  of  water  hyacinth  by  stating  that  the  water  hyacinth  is  a  very  fast  growing  plant  that  can  double  in  population  within  12  days  and  limits  boat  traffic,  swimming, and fishing; prevents sunlight and oxygen from reaching the water column and  submerged  plants;  shades  and  crowds  out  native  aquatic  plants;  and  noticeably  reduces  biodiversity in aquatic environments.      Aside  from  the  water  hyacinth,  other  aquatic  plants  have  been  recorded  for  use  in  water  gardens.    Riemer  (1984)  reported  that  floating  and  emergent  aquatic  plants,  because  of  their attractive flowers and foliage, are useful for pool and pond decoration in parks, golf  courses,  and  home  grounds;  indoor  pools  in  malls,  restaurants,  and  public  places.   Examples  include  water  lilies  such  as  yellow  floating  heart  and  pickerelweed  (Pontederia  cordata).  Other examples include the emergents,  Butomus  sp.,  Cyperus sp.,  Menyanthes sp.,  Nelumbo sp.,  Pontederia sp.,  Sagittaria sp.,  Typha sp., and other aroids.  Floating leaved and  freefloating representatives include  Aponogeton sp.,  Hydrocleys sp.,  Nuphar sp.,  Nymphaea  sp.,  Nymphoides  sp.,  Azolla  sp.,  Ceratopteris  sp.,  Pistia  sp.,  Salvinia  sp.,  Stratiotes  sp.,  and  Trapa sp. (Sculthorpe, 1967).     

2.3  Invasion success of aquatic plants  
 

2.3.1  Plant invasions  
Even though aquatic plants are introduced via the aquarium industry, mail parcels/order  catalogues,  internet  or  ornamental  ponds,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  these  species  will  become established or, if they survive, are even able to reproduce and eventually, become  invaders.    DehnenSchmutz  et  al.  (2007)  noted  that  the  success  of  plant  invasions  is  encouraged by the presence of factors such as repeated local introductions through market  outlets, and the development of traits via plant breeding that would increase the likelihood  of establishment if the plant escaped.   
28 

 

In contrast, Calado and Chapman (2006) indicated that if sufficient numbers of individual  species are released together, there is a greater chance of reproduction, either sexually or  asexually,  and  accordingly,  for  the  introduced  species  to  compete  successfully  for  the  habitat  against  the  native  species  already  established  in  the  waters.    Additionally,  Williamson  (1996),  made  reference  to  the  "tens  rule"  in  which  10%  of  imported  species  will be introduced into new environments, 10% of these will become established, and 10%  of these will become pests.  In essence, this rule suggests that 0.1% of all aquarium species  (plants and animals) will actually become introduced pests.           Cronk and Fuller (1995), in describing plant invasions, noted that there are several stages  that plants (aquatics included), must undergo in order to become established.  These stages  were  identified  as  introduction,  naturalization,  facilitation,  spread,  and  interaction  with  other plants and animals:   Introduction: plants become established accidentally or deliberately by human actions;   Naturalization: invasiveness occurs when plants become established beyond the initial  point  of  introduction  and  form  selfsustaining  populations.    These  populations  are  dependent on the population size, the plant's biological features (e.g. breeding system,  successful reproduction), and environmental conditions (e.g. climate, seasonality, and  soil conditions);   Facilitation:  plant  invasiveness  occurs  via  the  use  of  a  suitable  dispersal  agent,  the  presence of disturbance in the ecosystem, and/or the lack of pest and diseases;   Spread:  the  invasive  spread  of  plants  is  dependent  on  the  intrinsic  growth  and  reproductive rates of the plant, the nature of the invaded habitat, and the presence of  suitable places for reproduction.  Efficient seed dispersal is important and successful  plant  invaders  are  known  to  have  adaptations  for  short  and  long  distance  dispersal,  short  distance  bulking  up  of  existing  populations,  and  long  distance  establishment  of  new foci for further spread that is remote from the original site of invasion; and   Interaction with  animals  and  other  plants:  the  interaction  between native  plants  and  animals  decides  whether  the  invader  will  fit  in,  be  pushed  out,  or  have  an  impact  on  the ecosystem's processes, composition, and structure. 
29 

 

Heger  (2001)  throws  a  spin  on  the  issue  of  plant  invasions  by  stating  that  there  is  one  central problem with the approaches (e.g. examining the characteristics of invading species  and the ecosystem being invaded) put forward to describe the causes and mechanisms of  biological  invasions.    The  central  problem  was  that  "many  cases  have  shown  that  every  single  process  of  invasion  seems  to  be  unique,  and  for  every  rule,  an  exception  seems  to  exist" (Heger, 2001, p. 3).  In order to solve this problem, Heger (2001) suggested a plant  invasion  model  that  would  depict  the  entire  invasion  process  and  not  just  one  part  of  it.   The model is depicted as a staircase in which there is a sequence of stages and steps and  uses  an  underlying  hypothesis  that  "the  complexity  of  invasions  is  due  to  a  varying  influence  of  different  factors  during  the  process"  (Heger,  2001,  p.  34)  (Figure  4).      Each  stage in the staircase is reached by overcoming a specific step.  The four steps represent the  problems that a plant would have to overcome in the course of the invasion (Heger, 2001).      Heger (2001, p. 6) stated that the Â«staircase of invasionÂ» [sic], was an "idealised model of  an invasion process, which is able to serve as a tool for interpreting the invasion process."   Furthermore,  the  model  explained  why  a  species  with  a  lot  of  specific  characteristics  is  likely  to  become  a  successful  invader,  while  conversely;  a  species  might  be  successful  without  having  similar  characteristics.    Moreover,  "species  with  a  lot  of  favourable  characteristics  is  nonetheless  likely  to  become  a  successful  invader,  especially  if  it  is  repeatedly  introduced;  the  more  often  a  species  is  able  to  reach  the  first  step,  the  more  probable it is that the plant will be able to overcome the second step and the other steps  thereafter" (Heger, 2001, p. 8).      Ashton and Mitchell (1989, p. 113) concurred with Heger (2001) regarding the process of  invasions by stating that "each step in the progression from first arrival of the invader to  successful colonization of new habitats requires that a series of abiotic and biotic barriers  be  overcome  by  the  invader."    In  the  case  of  aquatic  plants,  Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989)  identified  three  main  stages  of  invasions:  arrival  of  an  individual  or  propagule,  establishment of the population through reproduction, and dispersal to new localities.  In  addition, adaptation of the new invader to the new locale may favour the selection of new  genetic strains (Figure 5).

STEPS OF AN  INVASION 

4. Acquisition of new localities: the  invader occupies other localities of  the same environmental quality or  of another quality  3. Population growth until the  minimum viable population (MVP)  is reached: invader builds up a  population that is large enough to  ensure survival in the new locale 

5. Spread in the new  locale completed 

2. Independent growth and  reproduction of at least one  individual: at least one individual  succeeds in growing, developing,  and reproducing 

4. Permanent establishment:  achieved if plant achieves at least one  population in the new locale that has  a good chance for persistence 

3. Spontaneous establishment:  at least one new generation has  been produced in the new area 

  1.    Immigration: one  or more invaders    reach the new locale         
         

2. Presence in the new locale:  invader escapes into the new  locale and becomes feral

  ESTABLISHMENT      SELECTION OF    NEW STRAINS      ADAPTATION TO    ENVIRONMENT    Figure 5:  Stages in the invasion and establishment of aquatic plants (Ashton and  Mitchell, 1989)    In describing each stage of the invasion, Ashton and Mitchell (1989) pointed out that each  stage  involved  a  series  of  interactions  between  the  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  features  of  the  environment  and  the  biological  characteristics  of  the  invader.    Moreover,  Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989,  p.  117)  indicated  that  the  "rate  at  which  the  invasion  occurs  will depend on the number of individuals or propagules present in the initial inoculum and  in  the  dispersal  stage."    In  light  of  these  statements,  Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989,  p.  113)  further noted that "the geographical distance between the source of the invading plant and  the eventual site of invasion represented perhaps the greatest barrier to natural invasions  by  aquatic  plants;  as  such,  the  production  of  resistant  seeds  and  propagules  by  many  aquatic  plants  provided  the  only  viable  means  whereby  aquatic  plants  may  survive  transport by biotic and abiotic mechanisms."

WIDESPREAD  DISPERSAL 

 

Arthington  and  Mitchell  (1986),  further  indicated  that  the  interactions  between  the  environment  and  the  invader  can  either  promote,  delay,  or  prevent  the  successful  completion  of  the  stages  as  was  defined  by  Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989),  and  that  an  exponential increase in the number of individuals present and the numbers involved in the  dispersal  stage  ensured  an  exponential  acceleration  in  the  apparent  rate  at  which  the  invasion would take place until the environmental factors became limiting.       Mitchell and Gopal (1991), in contrast to Ashton and Mitchell (1989), indicated that there  were five different stages in aquatic plant invasions: introduction, establishment (involving  local colonisation), survival, widespread dispersal, and production of numerous propagules  (Table 2).  Mitchell and Gopal (1991) further reported that any failure or incompletion of  any four stages would result in the failure of the invasion; and the invasion would remain  localised and fail eventually, if the last stage did not occur.  Moreover, all the stages of the  invasion  were  repeated  until  the  invader  was  considered  naturalised  and  the  dispersal  stage served as the forerunner to the initial stage of introduction in the new environment  (Mitchell and Gopal, 1991).

In  summary,  plant  invasions  appear  to  occur  using  several  stages:  introduction,  naturalization or establishment, dispersal, and adaptation to the environment.  If, however,  one  of  these  stages  failed  to  occur,  then  the  likely  outcome  would  be  a  failure  in  the  invasion  process.    Notwithstanding,  the  number  of  individuals  introduced  to  the  environment along with their reproductive potential were found to play an intricate role in  the invasion process.      

2.3.2  Traits of successful aquatic plant invaders  
As presented, plant invaders have to go through a number of processes and employ the use  of  various  strategies  in  order  to  become  established  in  a  new  environment.    Once  established,  however,  plant  invaders  have  been  found  to  exhibit  a  number  of  shared  characteristics.    Within  aquatic  environments,  Cronk  and  Fuller  (1995,  pp.  3233)  highlighted that aquatic plant invaders generally are "tolerant of a wide variety of aquatic  conditions; have very effective means of vegetative reproduction; exhibit rapid growth and  have  a  freefloating  habit;  are  often  perennials  and  herbaceous;  often  dioecious,  but  are  capable of vigorous asexual reproduction if one sex is absent; and in species where sexual  reproduction  is  utilised,  seeds  are  efficiently  dispersed  by  water  (e.g.  water  hyacinth,  Hydrilla, and Eurasian watermilfoil)."    Like  Cronk  and  Fuller,  Pieterse  and  Murray  (1990)  indicated  that  aquatic  plant  invaders  exhibited  rapid  vegetative  growth  especially,  if  the  nutrient  content  of  the  water,  light,  temperature  or  water movement did  not  have  a  limiting  effect; if the  plants  were  able  to  regenerate  asexually  via  fragmentation  or  vegetative  hibernating  organs  such  as  turions  and tubers; if the plants had the potential to be primary colonizers; and if the plant were  spread mainly by human activities.  Other characteristics of aquatic plant invaders include  the ability to use wind and/or water to disperse of seeds and spores (e.g.  Typha  spp., and  Phragmites  australis),  fragments  of  plants,  winter  buds,  turions,  and  other  propagules  (Wade,  1990);  are  generalists,  opportunists,  or  pioneer  species  and  have  high  stress  tolerance and morphological plasticity (Mitchell and Gopal, 1991).     
34 

 

ThiÃ©baut (2007) also stated that majority of aquatic invasive plants shared some or all of  the  following  characteristics:  short  life  cycle,  rapid  growth  rate,  high  level  of  energy  allocated  to  reproduction,  efficient  dispersal  mechanisms,  high  population  growth  rate,  wide distribution, high phenotypic plasticity, and flexible uses of environmental resources.   Of note, the mention of short life cycle as a trait of aquatic plant invaders contradicts that  listed  by  Cronk  and  Fuller  (1995),  who  reported  that  invaders  were  mainly  perennials.   This  contradiction  suggests  that  there  is  still  some  uncertainty  about  the  traits  of  an  aquatic plant invader and as such, is part of the reason for this research.      Even  though  aquatic  plant  invaders  tend  to  share  common  characteristics,  Mitchell  and  Gopal (1991, p. 148) remarked that "the possession of a suite of invasive characteristics by  a  particular  species  does  not  on  its  own  make  it  a  successful  invader  of  an  alien  system.   The penetration of a barrier in the absence of natural enemies may be more important in  providing  an  opportunity  window  for  the  invading  species  to  exploit."    Notwithstanding,  several  traits  of  successful  aquatic  invaders  have  been  described,  of  which;  the  most  important  is  reproduction  and  perennation.    The  others  include:  life  form  and  growth  characteristics, morphological plasticity, boomandbust, and propagule pressure.     2.3.2.1  Reproduction and perennation   The  survival  of  an  invasive  plant  has  been  found  to  be  dependent  on  the  success  and/or  failure  of  the  reproduction  mechanism  employed.    Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989,  p.  126)  pointed  out  that  in  "virtually  every  case  of  a  biological  invasion  by  plants,  success  in  the  initial  stages  depends  largely  on  the  invader's  reproductive  capacity."    However,  Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989)  indicated  that  the  reproductive  effort  put  out  by  plants  could  not  be  the  only  reason  for  all  invasions  since  not  all  invaders  were  equally  prolific;  as  such,  the  success  of  plant  invasions  depended  greatly  on  the  invader  being  able  to  compete  for  available resources and possessing rapid vegetative growth.     Nevertheless, in the case of aquatic plants, Ashton and Mitchell (1989, p. 121) reported that  aquatic  plant  invaders  "have  demonstrated a  marked  capacity for  advective  spread  when  introduced  into  new  environments  that  is  linked  to  factors  associated  with  dispersal  and 
35 

 

reproductive mechanisms."  These factors included: vegetative reproduction, which is the  usually  the  most  common  method  of  reproduction  in  aquatic  plants;  dispersal  of  aquatic  plants  between  and  within  countries  by  humans;  fast  reproductive  rates  that  eventually  make aquatic plants become nuisance weeds; and sexual sterility of aquatic plants that may  become  locally  naturalized  unless  they  are intentionally  spread  by humans  or  have  small  vegetative propagules that can be dispersed by other means (Ashton and Mitchell, 1989).      Cronk and Fuller (1995), in their discussion on plant invasions, stated that aquatic plants  employed  what  is  called  a  breeding  system.    In  this  system,  a  high  number  of  invasive  aquatic  plants  were  either  monoecious  or  dioecious.    Some  successful  dioecious  aquatic  plants such as parrot feather, Hydrilla, and African waterweed, have either developed ways  of  combating  the  disadvantages  associated  with  dioecy  or  have  been  introduced  in  large  numbers  that  reduced  the  problems  of  initial  seed  settling.    One  way  identified  of  overcoming  the  problems  of  dioecy  was  reproducing  primarily  by  vegetative  means  and  dispersal  by  water  (Cronk  and  Fuller,  1995).    In  terms  of  monoecious  plants,  aquatic  invaders  such  as  water  hyacinth  were  found  to  be  selfcompatible  that  allow  seeds  to  be  produced  when  the  plant  was  isolated  or  at  low  population  levels.    Water  hyacinth  also  reproduces vegetatively (Cronk and Fuller, 1995).            Invasive aquatic plants were also found to exhibit strategic traits in terms of reproduction.   MacArthur and Wilson (1967) noted that freefloating species such as water hyacinth and  giant  Salvinia  and  submerged  species  such  as  Hydrilla  and  Elodea  had  high  reproductive  rates  and  are  opportunistic  Rstrategists;  that  is,  these  plants  were  capable  of  prolific  vegetative reproduction, especially from one viable plant to start a new colony.  In addition,  Wade  (1990)  pointed  out  that  Rstrategist  plants  were  likely  to  become  aquatic  weeds4  when their habitat was subjected to habitual disturbance.      Aquatic  invasive  plants  have  also  been  described  as  RÂ­  or  C  strategists  or  competitors.    Using Grime's (1979) CSR model that described the life history strategies of plants, Lacoul

and  Freedman  (2006,  p.  106)  pointed  out  that  competitors  were  found  in  "fertile,  infrequently  disturbed  habitats,  have  high  productivity,  and  often  cast  a  dense  shade."   Examples include water hyacinth,  Elodea,  Hydrilla, and Eurasian watermilfoil.  In addition,  aquatic  plant  invaders  were  found  to  be  able  to  exclude  other  submerged  aquatic  plants  because of their superior ability to secure light, space, and nutrients (Lacoul and Freedman,  2006). Furthermore, because of the extreme variability of aquatic environments, plants are  selected if they have a high degree of reproductive plasticity and multiple adaptations for  regeneration (Grime, 1979).    Like Ashton and Mitchell, ThiÃ©baut (2007) also reported that the mode of propagation may  be responsible for the spread of aquatic plants by affecting their evolutionary potential and  dispersal  ability.    The  mode  of  propagation  used  by  aquatic  plants  was  described  by    Sculthorpe  (1967)  who  remarked  that  aquatic  plants  have  a  tendency  to  replace  sexual  reproduction  with  vegetative  reproduction,  which  is  especially  advantageous  to  plants  living in deeper water.  In addition, the use of "vegetative propagules probably contributed  significantly to the dissemination of species about the globe based on the ease with which  they  are  accidentally  transported  by  floods,  waterfowl,  other  animals  and  man"  (Sculthorpe, 1967, p. 334) (Table 3).

37 

 

Vegetative  propagules  such  as  tubers,  rhizomes,  or  suckers,  ThiÃ©baut  (2007)  noted,  gave  introduced  aquatic  plants  a  competitive  advantage  over  other  species  by  having  an  early  start  in  growth  at  the  required  time.    Additionally,  Sculthorpe  (1967)  pointed  out  that  colonisation by aquatic plants involved the use of rhizomes, stolons, and runners that were  widespread, used to store food reserves and functioned as a hibernacula thus enabling the  plant  to  survive  conditions  unfavourable  to  vegetative  growth.    Some  temperate  aquatic  plants,  Sculthorpe  (1967)  indicated,  produced  organs  which  were  not  developed  during  normal  vegetative  growth  but  were  formed  in  response  to  depleted  nutrient  supply  or  abnormal conditions and served for perennation.  For example, Sagittaria and Potamogeton  formed small tubers on the ends of stolons or lateral branches,  Myriophyllum,  Utricularia,  and  Hydrocharis  developed  specialised  dwarf  shoots  called  turions,  and  Ceratophyllum  dense  shoot  apices.    All  these  organs,  tubers,  turions,  and  apices,  were  protected  by  mucilage  or  a  thick  cuticle  and  were  loaded  with  food  reserves  and  remained  dormant  throughout the winter (Sculthorpe, 1967).    Sculthorpe  (1967)  reported  that  aquatic  plants  also  use  gemmipary  as  a  means  of  vegetative multiplication.  Gemmipary, Sculthorpe (1967) noted, occurred in some species  naturally while in others, was induced because of isolation of, or injury to, a leaf.  Aquatic  plants such as  Cardamine sp. and  Rorippa sp. that are used in the aquarium trade exhibit  gemmipary.    In  these  plants,  fragments  of  leaflets  can  produce  young  plants,  or  as  buds  present on the plants elongate, adventitious roots develop at the base and anchor the new  individual (Sculthorpe, 1967).       Regeneration  is  another  strategy  used  by  aquatic  plants  to  increase  their  numbers  in  the  new  environment.    Sculthorpe  (1967)  pointed  out  that  in  freefloating  species  and  submerged  plants  regeneration  from  any  small  part  bearing  a  bud  is  a  common  practice  after fragmentation of the plant body.  In floating species such as  Salvinia, mosquito fern,  and  members  of  the  Lemnaceae  family  (e.g.  water  lettuce),  the  most  minute  part  of  the  stem that bears an axillary bud or a fragment with a vegetative bud pouch gives rise to a  new individual (Sculthorpe, 1967).     
38 

 

In  the  case  of  submerged  aquatic  plant  invaders  such  as  Brazilian  waterweed,  coontail,  Elodea,  Hydrilla,  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  and  African  waterweed,  the  vegetative  organs  are  very  brittle  and  could  be  easily  broken  into  a  myriad  of  fragments  following  disturbance  (e.g.  currents,  wind,  and  animals).    Once a  fragment  was  detached,  any  part  of  the  axis is  potentially  viable  and  capable  of  yielding  a  new  plant.    The  new  plant  would  appear,  especially  if  that  part  of  the  plant  bears  a  dormant  lateral  bud  from  which  new  growth  could  occur  or  any  other  bud,  or  part  of  a  node  from  which  a  new  individual  could  be  regenerated  (Sculthorpe,  1967).    ThiÃ©baut  (2007)  concurred  when  she  reported  that  aquarium species, such as  Elodea spp., Brazilian waterweed, and  Myriophyllum spp., were  able  to  multiply  by  fragmentation  using  vegetative  buds  or  cuttings,  which  made  these  plants  efficient  in  spreading  to  new  areas,  providing  that  they  could  survive  the  winter  months.      In  terms  of  sexual  reproduction,  Spencer  and  Bowes  (1990,  p.  59)  state  that  "seed  production  was  an  important  means  to  aid  survival  during  periods  of  adverse  environmental  conditions  and  to  improve  the  chances  for  successful  invasion  of  a  new  area".    Van  Vierssen  (1990)  reported  that  aquatic  plants  produce  high  numbers  of  seeds  that can germinate the season after they are produced (e.g.  Ruppia sp.) or low number of  seeds  or  none  at  all.    The  latter  is  seen  in  aquatic  plants  that  produce  tubers,  turions,  or  stem fragments in unfavourable conditions (e.g. Eurasian watermilfoil).  Additionally, seeds  of  aquatic  plants  remain  viable  for  long  periods  and  are  a  trait  of  species  that  normally  depend  on  vegetative  propagules  (e.g.  water  hyacinth)  (van  Vierssen,  1990).    Sculthorpe  (1967) noted that seeds produced from submerged species were usually small, contained  small  carbohydrate  reserves,  and  remained  viable  for  several  years.    Furthermore,  seeds  enhanced  the  survival  of  submerged  plants  during  adverse  conditions;  for  example,  drought, cold, and salinity (Sculthorpe, 1967).       Sculthorpe  (1967)  also  noted  that  water  was  the  main  medium  of  spread  for  seeds  since  there was a buoyancy stage that allowed vegetative propagules to be carried away from the  competition  of  the  parental  habitat.    In  submerged  and  floating  aquatic  plants,  the  fruits  and  seeds produced  did  not  have  large  powers  of  floatation  and  either  sank  immediately 
39 

 

(e.g.  Ceratophyllum  sp.)  or  floated  for  a  short  time  facilitating  dispersal  from  the  parent  plant (e.g.  Myriophyllum  sp.).  In emergent plants, water also distributed the buoyant fruits  and  seeds  produced  onto  adjacent  terrestrial  soils  or  into  estuarine  or  coastal  waters  (Sculthorpe,  1967).    Wade  (1990)  pointed  out  that  in  addition  to  seeds  water  also  transports  plant  fragments,  winter  buds,  turions,  and  other  propagules,  assisted  by  the  wind and currents.     2.3.2.2  Life form and growth characteristics   The  variability  of  the  aquatic  environment  (e.g.  alternate  periods  of  wetting  and  drying  over seasonal or shortterm and a seasonal or longterm cycles, temperature, day length)  was found to play a major role in the regulation of aquatic plant growth and was deemed  critical to the success or failure of an invasion (Ashton and Mitchell, 1989).  Nevertheless,  aquatic plants whether floating, submerged, or emergent were found to exhibit traits that  contributed  to  their  success  as  aquatic  invaders.    In  the  case  of  freefloating  aquatic  invasive  plants  such  as  the  water  hyacinth,  mosquito  fern,  giant  Salvinia,  and  coontail,  Ashton and Mitchell (1989, p. 125) reported that these plants exhibited specific traits that  contribute to their success as invaders.  These traits included "the capacity for extremely  rapid vegetative multiplication, the ability to regenerate from small portions of vegetative  thalli, complete or partial independence of sexual reproduction, a growth morphology that  produces the largest possible area of photosynthetic tissue in relation to the whole plant,  and spreads over the entire water surface, independence of substrate conditions and water  levels, and in space limited areas, the ability to accumulate organic matter that promotes  the development of emergent type vegetation by acting as primary colonizers."      For emergents and submerged aquatic invaders, Sculthorpe (1967) reported that because  these plants were rooted and depended on a more stable hydrological regime for survival  than freefloating species, the attributes of success were different.  Submerged species such  as  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  Elodea,  Brazilian  waterweed,  Hydrilla,  and  African  waterweed  were  known  only  to  grow  in  areas  where  a  suitable  substratum  existed,  light  penetrated  the water column, and were affected by increased turbidity and populations of planktonic  algae.  In light of these conditions, submerged aquatic invaders were restricted to certain 
40 

 

environmental conditions, occupied all available habitats, and quickly colonized new areas  (Ashton and Mitchell, 1989).    Moreover, submerged aquatic plants that were successful invaders generally were found:  to  possess  intercellular  lacunal  systems  that  provided  buoyancy  to  the  photosynthetic  organs,  have  reduced  structural  rigidity;  to  be  able  to  remain  dormant  or  overwinter  in  unfavourable  environmental  conditions;  to  be  capable  of  regenerating  from  small  stem  fragments;  to  be  completely  independent  of  sexual  reproduction;  to  manufacture  large  numbers  of  vegetative  propagules  (e.g.  tubers,  turions,  and  dormant  apices)  that  are  important  in  the  recolonization  of  cleared  areas  and  invasions  of  new  areas  (Sculthorpe,  1967); and to persist for a rather short time and then are replaced by other species (Cook,  1990).    Emergent invaders such as common reed (Phragmites  australis) and  Typha spp. possessed  longlived, resistant rhizomes, which acted as nutrient stores during unfavourable periods  and produced tall, structurally rigid stems and leaves, which shade out competing species  (Ashton  and  Mitchell,  1989).    These  plants  also  have  variable  vegetative  growth  patterns  that  prevent  the  entry  of  competing  species  or  rapidly  exploit  new  colonization  sites  (LovettDoust,  1981;  Hutchings  and  Bradbury,  1986),  manufacture  large  amounts  of  minute  seeds  suited  for  longrange  dispersal,  regenerate  after  cutting  (Westlake,  1963),  and use diaspores for longrange dispersal (Cook, 1990).    Apart from the individual attributes that have been identified that make floating, emergent,  and  submerged  aquatic  plant  invaders  successful,  Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989)  also  noted  that  another  factor  that  contributed  to  their  success  is  the  fact  that  most  aquatic  plant  invaders  are  taxonomically  related  to  endogenous  species,  which  are  not  invasive.    In  addition, aquatic plant invaders can also resemble other plants that may occupy the same  habitat but are not always invasive (Ashton and Mitchell, 1989).  Based on this fact, it can  be  surmised  that  misidentification  of  invasive  aquatic  plants  increases  the  probability  of  their spread and distribution worldwide.  One example cited by Ashton and Mitchell (1989)  was the water hyacinth and anchored water hyacinth (Eichhornia azurea).  Both species are 
41 

 

closely  related  and  distributed  by  the  water  garden  industry.    They  also  have  similar  distribution  patterns  but  differ  in  terms  of  their  invasiveness,  as  only  the  water  hyacinth  has caused serious problems (Ashton and Mitchell, 1989).      Another  example  of  taxonomically  related  species  was  described  by  Sculthorpe  (1967).   The  family  Hydrocharitaceae  contained  aquatic  plant  invaders  that  were  taxonomically  close such as  Elodea,  Hydrilla, Brazilian waterweed, and African waterweed.  These aquatic  plant invaders were found to exhibit similar morphology of whorls of short sessile leaves  and  stems  with  short  internodes,  and  as  such,  are  often  confused  with  each  other  even  though  these  aquatic  plants  have  different  native  distributions.    Arthington  and  Mitchell  (1986)  also  realised  that  although  the  aforesaid  aquatic plants  have  been  responsible  for  major invasions outside of their native distribution, there are other members of the family  with  similar  morphology  that  do  not  show  invasive  traits;  however,  there  is  no  clear  explanation for the mechanisms of the invasions or the lack of invasions exhibited by other  members of the family.     2.3.2.3  Morphological plasticity   Aquatic  plants  invaders  were  also  found  to  exhibit  a  trait  called  morphological  plasticity.   Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989,  p.  127)  described  morphological  plasticity  as  the  "ability  of  a  species  to  modify  the  shape,  and  size  of  its  vegetative  structures  when  grown  under  different  environmental  conditions."    Moreover,  the  presence  of  morphological  plasticity  provided aquatic plants with the ability to adapt its phenotype to suit any habitat and gave  invaders  the  competitive  edge  over  other  aquatic  plants  for  a  wide  range  of  habitats  and  promoted  the  dominance  of  the  invader  once  the  habitat  was  occupied  (Ashton  and  Mitchell, 1989).          Water hyacinth is one example of an aquatic plant invader that exhibits this trait.  Ashton  and  Mitchell  (1989)  reported  that  water  hyacinth  produces  two  distinct  growth  forms  based  on  the  habitat  in  which  they  are  found.    One  growth  form  is  called  the  colonizing  form,  which  has  spherical  floatlike  petioles  and  flattened,  circular  laminae.    This  form  is  found in open water habitats that has no space restriction and multiplies rapidly by the use 
42 

 

of stolons.  The other growth form is matlike with long elongated petioles and vertically  arranged  orbicular  laminae  that  are  held  together  by  closely  interlinked  stolons  (Ashton  and Mitchell, 1989).  Gopal (1987) revealed that if either of these water hyacinth growth  forms  were  moved  from  their  original  habitat,  the  plant  would  change  its  morphology  within 1020 days to suit the new habitat.            Giant  Salvinia  is  another  aquatic  plant  invader  that  exhibits  morphological  plasticity.           Ashton and Mitchell (1989) reported that giant  Salvinia has three growth forms: a survival  form  with  four  to  five  pairs  of  flattened  leaves  (1Â­2cm  in  length)  spaced  out  on  a  short  rhizome, a colonizing form that resembles the survival form but is four to five times larger,  and a mat form with large erect leaves, closely pressed to each other and closely spaced on  the rhizome.  Ashton and Mitchell (1989) further noted that the survival form is found in  adverse  conditions  (e.g.  low  nutrient  levels)  and  has  low  growth  rates  whereas  the  colonizing form is found in open water where space is not restricted and has high growth  rates.    The  mat  form  is  found  in  established  mat  formations  with  relatively  low  in  situ  growth rates.     2.3.2.4  Boomandbust and propagule pressure   Williamson (1996) reported that there were some factors that favoured success of aquatic  plant invasions, for instance, boomandbust and propagule pressure.  Boomandbust has  been  used  to  describe  when  an  invading  species  increases  to  peak  density  and  then  declines.      The presence of Elodea in the British Isles has been cited as a classic example of boomand bust  (Elton,  1958;  Simpson,  1984;  Williamson,  1996).    Elton  (1958)  outlined  that  Elodea  was noticed in a pond in 1842 on the Scottish border.  Subsequently thereafter, Elodea was  found in canals, ditches, lochs, and ponds all over the country, was carried downstream or  along  canals,  on  birds  and  introduced  as  scientific  curiosity.    Simpson  (1984)  noted  that  based  on  the  prolific  growth  of  Elodea,  by  1855  the  plant  was  blocking  drains,  sluices,  navigable sections of rivers.  It had spread as far as Ireland by 1866 and Scotland by 1880.   Simpson (1984) further reported that once Elodea became established in an area, the plant

would  increase  to  pest  proportions  within  three  to  four  years;  the  population  would  maintain itself for another three to ten years after which the population would decline to a  lower  problem  status.    The  cause  of  the  rapid  decline  in  Elodea  remains  unknown.   However,  Elton  (1958)  and  Williamson  (1996)  surmised  that  the  decline  of  the  Elodea  population could have resulted from low availability of resources, interactions between the  invader and prey species, or genetics.                In  terms  of  propagule  pressure,  Williamson  (1996)  pointed  out  that  as  the  number  of  propagules  produced  by  the  invading  plant  increased,  the  greater  the  chances  of  the  species becoming established.  If the number of propagules produced is small, even though  they  may  get  dispersed,  the  probability  of  some  propagules  finding  suitable  habitat  and  becoming established decreases, and the resulting plants may be diffuse and not have the  opportunity  to  reproduce  sexually.    With  greater  propagule  numbers,  however,  the  probability  of  finding  a  suitable  habitat  increases,  success  of  reproduction  increases,  and  avoiding difficulties from weather phenomena increases (Williamson, 1996).       Several  authors  have  described  the  attributes  or  traits  that  have  made  aquatic  plants  successful  invaders.    These  traits  were  mainly  focused  on  the  morphology,  reproduction,  and physiology of aquatic plants.  In order to put the traits of a successful aquatic invader in  perspective, the characteristic traits have been summarized and presented in Table 4.

2.4  Legislative  framework  for  the  introduction  of  aquatic  plants  into  Ontario  
 

2.4.1  Canadian Food Inspection Agency  
Importation  of  plants  into  Ontario  is  regulated  by  the  Canadian  Food  Inspection  Agency  (CFIA).    The  CFIA  is  one  arm  of  the  federal  government,  responsible  for  food  inspection,  protecting the environment in terms of plant protection and animal health, and consumer  protection  as  it  relates  to  food  (CFIA,  2010a;  CFIAA,  1997).    Formed  in  1997  under  the  Canadian  Food  Inspection  Agency  Act  (CFIAA),  the  CFIA's  strategic  outcomes  include  and  are not limited to:       In terms of plant protection, the CFIA oversees a number of products and sectors such as:  biotechnology,  fertilizers,  forestry,  grains  and  field  crops,  horticulture,  plant  breeders'  rights, plant pests, potatoes, seeds, and variety registration (CFIA, 2010b).  The Agency also  designs  and  administers  programmes  and  services  with  the  aim  of  protecting  Canada's  plant  resource  bases.    These  programmes  and  services  include  and  are  not  limited  to:  taking  part  in  international  standard  setting  for  phytosanitary  measures,  conducting  surveillance  of  pests  and  plant  health  risk  assessments, making  sure  that  plant  and  plant  product exports meet foreign requirements, ensuring the plant and plant product imports  meet  Canadian  requirements,  and  providing  information  on  fact  sheets  and  policies  addressing plant pests (CFIA, 2010b).      Incidentally, there are approximately 73 plant pests that the CFIA provides information on  that  are  mainly  agricultural  or  forestry  related  (CFIA,  2010c).    The  CFIA  also  regulates  pests  that  pose  a  quarantine  risk  or  were  determined  through  a  risk  assessment  to  be  quarantine  pests  for  Canada.    Approximately  240  quarantine  pests  are  regulated.    Of  the

240  pests,  seven  are  plants  (Figure  6).    These  plants  are  barberry  (Berberis  sp.),  dodder  (Cuscuta  sp.),  barberry  (Mahoberberis  sp.),  barberry  (Mahonica  sp.),  broomrape  (Orobanche sp.), buckthorn (Rhamnus sp.), and withchweed (Striga sp.) (CFIA, 2010d).      It is important to note that the CFIA does not provide a definition of the term "pest".  There  is, however, a definition for a "quarantine pest" in accordance with the  International  Plant  Protection Convention (IPPC), which is an international agreement on plant health that aims  to protect cultivated and wild plants by stopping the introduction and distribution of pests  (FAO,  n.d.).    Under  the  Convention,  a  quarantine  pest  is  defined  as  "a  pest  of  potential  economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present  but  not  widely  distributed  and  being  officially  controlled"  (FAO,  2010,  p.  15).    The  Convention  also  defines  the  term  "pest",  which  is  "any  species,  strain  or  biotype  of  plant,  animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plant or plant products" (FAO, 2010, p. 12).  Based  on the definition of a pest under the IPPC, it can be deduced that invasive aquatic plants can  be  described  as  pests  since  they  impact  native  species.    The  term  pest  is  also  one  of  the  many adjectives used to describe IAS in general (Colautti and MacIsaac, 2004).  There are,  however, no aquatic plant pests on the CFIA plant pest or quarantine plant pest lists.    

2.4.1.1  CFIA and invasive plants 
In addressing invasive plants, the CFIA has undertaken two initiatives: the preparation of  an  Invasive  Plants  Policy and  Canada's  Least  Wanted  Plants  Pilot  Project.  The Agency also  has  responsibilities  under  the  Government  of  Canada's  An  Invasive  Species  Strategy  for  Canada (2004).      Invasive Plants Policy  The Invasive Plants Policy is a draft document prepared following consultation held in 2010  (CFIA,  2010e).    The  aim  of  the  policy  is  to  "develop  and  implement  regulations  and  phytosanitary  measures  as  they  apply  to  the  importation  and  domestic  movement  of  invasive  plants  designated  as  pests  and/or  prohibited  noxious  weeds"  (CFIA,  2010e).

Of  note,  plant  pests  are  designated  under  the  Plant  Protection  Act  (1990)  and  prohibited  noxious weeds, under the Weed Seeds Order (2005) of the Seeds Act (2009).  The policy also  reported  that  the  decision  to  regulate  a  plant  as  a  pest  was  based  on  science  and  other  appropriate  deliberations  as  is  Canada's  obligations  required  under  the  World  Trade  Organization (WTO) Agreement, on the application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures  (SPS) and as a signatory to the IPPC (CFIA, 2010e).         The scientific basis used for regulating invasive plants is pest risk analysis (PRA).  Under  the  IPPC,  a  PRA  is  "the  process  of  evaluating  biological  or  other  scientific  and  economic  evidence to determine whether an organism is a pest, whether it should be regulated, and  the strength of any phytosanitary measures to be taken against it" (FAO, 2010, p. 13).  In  general,  persons  introducing  plants  or  plant  products  into  Canada  complete  an  import  permit form under the  Plant  Protection  Act  (Appendix 1).  If the plant being imported has  not been previously introduced, a PRA is conducted in order to determine whether or not  the species could be designated as a regulated pest.  If the plant has significant risks, the  plant  is  then  elected  for  regulation  and  subjected  to  public  consultation.    At  the  consultation, risk management documents (RMD) developed from weed risk assessments  on the species in question are presented for comments.  A final decision is then made by the  CFIA (taking into account the public's comments) and the species designated as a regulated  pest is added to the Pests Regulated by Canada list.               Plants designated as pests are subjected to regulatory control or action that include and are  not limited to: prohibition (import and domestic movement), an import permit that allows  the material contaminated with the regulated article to enter or move within Canada for a  specific  end  use  under  specific  conditions,  phytosanitary  certification  from  the  exporting  country,  combination  of  import  permit  and  phytosanitary  certification,  and  destruction,  treatment or ordered to be returned to origin (CFIA, 2010e).  Risk mitigation measures are  also  determined  and  implemented  based  on  the  pathway,  enduse  of  the  plant,  or  plant  product  (CFIA,  2010e).    There  are  five  major  pathways  through  which  species  to  be  regulated  arrive  and  spread  in  Canada:  seed  for  propagation,  plants  to  be  planted  (e.g.  ornamentals),  grains,  hay,  straw  and  packing  material,  and  soils  (CFIA,  2010e).    In 
49 

 

situations  where  the  plant  has  been  previously  imported  and  is  later  determined  to  be  a  regulated pest, the CFIA would then forbid any further importation or local movement of  that  particular  species  or  any  plant  products  that  may  have  been  contaminated  by  said  species (CFIA, 2010e).      All  regulatory  decisions  on  the  specific  plant  pest  are  posted  on  the  CFIA  website,  in  the  Plant  Protection  Policy  Directives and the  Automated  Import  Reference  System  (AIRS).  The  AIRS is a searchable database hosted by the CFIA of import requirements.  Approximately  96 policy directives are listed on the CFIA website for the years 1994 to 2010.  There are  also five RMDs for the years 2007, 2008 and 2010.  Of the directives and RMDs listed, there  are none specific to aquatic plants or the aquarium and ornamental pond industries.       Canada's Least Wanted Plants Pilot Project  Under  Canada's  Least  Wanted  Plants  Pilot  Project, 25 RMDs were prepared (Table 5).  Each  plant  was  detailed  under  various  subjects,  namely:  hardiness  zone,  distribution,  sector(s)/habitat  affected,  agricultural,  horticultural,  environmental  and/or  societal  impacts,  pathways,  and  CFIA  recommendation.    Of  the  25  plants  listed,  only  one  species,  sessile  joy  weed  (Alternanthera  sessilis)  is  used  as  an  aquarium  and/or  ornamental  pond  plant  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area  (GTA).    However,  this  species  is  listed  as  absent  in  Canada (CFIA, 2010f).  Further, the hardiness zone of sessile joy weed was determined to  be a seven (mild) which fell only within the southwestern region of British Columbia (NRC,  2003).    Sessile  joy  weed  is  regulated  as  a  quarantine  pest  under  the  Plant  Protection  Act  and  is  located  on  the  Pests  Regulated  by  Canada  list  (CFIA,  2010f).    This  plant  is  also  regulated  under  the  Seeds  Act  (1985)  as  a  Class  1,  Prohibited  Noxious  Weed  (WSO1)  on  the  Weed  Seeds  Order (2005).  Of concern, is that in spite of these listings, sessile joy weed  continues to be sold in the GTA.

The  Strategy  response  to  IAS  includes  preventing  new  invasions,  detecting  and  responding  rapidly  to  new  invaders,  managing  established  and  spreading  invaders  through  containment,  eradication,  and  control  (GOC,  2004), as well as preventing the introductions of IAS from other countries, or from other  areas within Canada (CFIA, 2010g).       

51 

 

The CFIA has the responsibility of implementing the Strategy in relation to invasive alien  plants and plant pests by focusing on prevention through sciencebased regulations, plant  surveillance,  pest  eradication,  risk  management,  and  public  awareness  (CFIA,  2010g)  in  keeping  with  their  mandate.    Accordingly,  the  CFIA  works  to  prevent  the  entry  and/or  establishment  of  new  plant  pests,  limit  the  distribution  of  pests  already  present,  and  to  certify  plant  and  plant  products  for  pestfree  domestic  and  international  trade  (CFIA,  2010g).      

2.4.1.2 

Administration and enforcement of the CFIA 

The  CFIA  reports  to  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  AgriFood  and  is  responsible  for  the  administration and enforcement of the  Agriculture  and  AgriFood  Administrative  Monetary  Penalties  Act  (1995),  Canada  Agricultural  Products  Act  (1985),  Fertilizers  Act  (2009  Â­  Chapter  F10),  Fish  Inspection  Act,  Health  of  Animals  Act  (2009  Â­  Chapter  F12),  Meat  Inspection Act (1985), Plant Breeders' Act (1990), Plant Protection Act (1990), and the Seeds  Act (2009 Â­ Chapter S8).  Of these, the Plant Protection Act (1990) and the Seeds Act (2009)  pertain to plant imports and will be discussed here.    The Plant Protection Act (1990)   The  Plant  Protection  Act, 1990 (PPA) was written with the intent to "protect plant life and  the  agricultural  and  forestry  sectors  by  preventing  the  importation,  exportation,  and  spread  of  pests  and  by  controlling  or  eradicating  pests  within  Canada"  (PPA,  2009,  p.  1).   Under  the  Act,  the  term  pest  relates  to  "anything  that  may  be  injurious  or  potentially  injurious, directly or indirectly, to plants, plant products or plant byproducts" (PPA, 2009,  p. 2).  The term also relates to plants that can be described as pests.      Sections  6  and  7  of  the  Act  make  provisions  for  the  control  and  importation  and  exportation of pests.  Of note are subsections 6(1) and 7(1).  Subsection 6(1) speaks to the  prohibition of a person growing, raising, culturing, or producing or moving anything that is  a pest, is or could be infested with a pest, or could be a biological problem to the control of  a  pest,  except  as  allowed  by  provisions  under  the  Act  or  regulations.    Subsection  7(1) 
52 

 

indicates that there shall be no importation of anything that is a pest, is or could be infested  with a pest, or could be a biological problem to the control of a pest, unless:       The  PPA  also  works  in  conjunction  with  several  regulations  that  were  formed  under  Section  47  of  the  Act.    There  are  12  regulations  under  the  PPA.    These  regulations  relate  mainly  to  the  agricultural  sector,  such  as  eggplant  and  tomato  production,  golden  nematode (Globodera  rostochiensis), potato production and sale, potato wart (Synchytrium  endobioticum),  and  plum  pox  virus,  which  affects  fruit  trees.    There  are  also  regulations  relating to forest pests, fungal pathogens (e.g. Phytophthora ramorum, which causes sudden  oak  disease)  and  ashfree  zones  (DOJ  Canada,  2011).    The  regulations  of  concern  to  this  paper are the Plant Protection Regulations.     The Plant Protection Regulations (2009)   The  Plant  Protection  Regulations,  2009  (PPR)  like  the  PPA,  was  intended  to  prevent  "the  importation, exportation, and spreading of pests injurious to plants and provisions for their  control and eradication, and for the certification of plants" (PPR, 2009, p. 1).  Eradication  and  prevention  of  the  spread  of  pests  are  controlled  by  means  of  a  pest  risk  assessment.   This assessment is done in accordance with the  International  Standards  for  Phytosanitary  Measures, Part I Â­ Import Regulations, Guidelines for Pest Risk Analysis, which allow for:       
53 

the item being imported is in accordance with subsection 7(2);  the  importer  has  shown  all  permits,  certificates  and  related  documents  as  required by the regulations; and  the item is imported/exported in accordance with the regulations. 

determining pest(s);  recommending actions to prevent the introduction, spread, eradication, or control  of a pest into, within, and from Canada;  identifying potential adverse effects on the environment by the pest; and  minimizing  environmental  degradation  with  respect  to  Canadian  flora  (PPR,  2009). 

 

In  terms  of  importation,  the  PPR  stipulates  that  "no  person  shall  import  into  Canada  anything  that  is  a  pest,  is  or  could  be  infested  or  constitute  a  biological  obstacle  to  the  control  of  a  pest"  without  a  valid  permit  or  phytosanitary  certificate  (PPR,  2009,  p.  15).   This  permit  is  issued  by  the  Minister  who  has  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  "that  the  importation  of  a  thing  will  or  would  likely  result  in  the  introduction  or  spread  within  Canada, of a thing that is a pest, is or could be infested or constitutes or could constitute a  biological obstacle to the control of a pest ... determines that every precaution necessary to  prevent the introduction into or spread within Canada of any pest or biological obstacle to  the  control  of  a  pest  can  and  will  be  taken"  (PPR,  2009,  p.  19).    Further,  the  regulations  speak  to  the  prohibition  of  things  into  or  en  route  to  Canada  that  may  be  described  as  a  pest and/or infested with a pest (PPR, 2009). The provision outlined for issuing an import  permit  based  on  a  risk  assessment  appears  contradictory  given  that  a  risk  assessment  is  supposed to exclude species based on their perceived risk.       The  PPR  also  contains  two  Schedules:  prohibited  movement  within  Canada  (Schedule  I)  and  restricted  movement  within  Canada  (Schedule  II).    Within  each  schedule,  plants  are  described  under  four  column  headings:  thing,  place  of  origin,  destination,  and  pest.    For  Schedule II, another column, requirements, was added, which speaks to movement within  Canada.    Of  note,  there  are  no  aquatic  plants  distributed  by  the  aquarium  or  ornamental  pond industries listed on either Schedule I or Schedule II.  Other issues addressed by the  PPR  include  and  are  not  limited  to  the  quarantine,  investigation,  survey,  processing  or  treatment  of  potential  pest  or  pest  areas,  prohibition,  restriction  or  control  of  pest  movement, seizure and detention, disposition, and declaration (PPR, 2009).    The Seeds Act (2009)   The  Seeds  Act,  2009  is  intended  to  address  the  "testing,  inspection,  quality,  and  sale  of  seeds" into, within, and from Canada (Seeds  Act, 2009, p. 1).  Under Section 4(1) of the Act,  regulations can be made by the Governor in Council with respect to seed grades, inspection,  purity and quality of seeds, seed testing, registration of seed varieties, disposition of items  forfeited and detention amongst others (Seeds Act, 2009).     
54 

 

Seeds Regulations (2009)   Under  the  Seeds  Act,  the  Seeds  Regulations,  2009,  was  written  with  the  intention  of  "respecting  the  quality  of  seeds  including  seed  potatoes,  and  the  testing,  inspection,  and  sale  thereof"  (Seeds  Regulations,  2009,  p.  1).    The  regulations  contain  seven  Schedules:   seed  of  the  kinds  and  species  Â­  minimum  weed  seed  and  other  crop  seed  standards  (Schedule I), seed of a kind set that can be sold under variety name (Schedule II), species,  kinds  or  types  of  crops  subject  to  variety  registration  (Schedule  III),  grades  or  seed  potatoes  (Schedule  IV),  and  Schedules  V  to  VI  that  were  repealed.    The  invasive  aquatic  plants  reed  canary  grass  (Phalaris  arundinacea)  and  water  cress  (Nasturtium  officinale)  were  listed  on  Schedules  I  Â­  III  and  Schedule  I,  respectively.    Of  concern  is  that  both  invasive  aquatic  plants  are  allowed  to  be  sold  within  the  GTA  and  on  the  wider  scale,  Canada.           Weed Seeds Order (2005)   The Weed Seeds Order, 2005 (WSO), falls under Subsection 4(2) of the Seeds Act, 2009.  The  Order is intended to address weed seeds, that are, "the seeds of the species of plants that  are deemed to be weed seeds for the purpose of establishing grades under the  Seeds  Act"  (WSO,  2005).    These  weed  seeds  were  listed  under  six  classes:  prohibited  noxious  weed  seeds  (Class  1),  primary  noxious  weed  seeds  (Class  2),  secondary  noxious  weed  seeds  (Class 3 and Class 4), noxious weed seeds (Class 5), and other weed seeds (Class 6).  There  are 20 species listed under Class 1, 17 under Class 2 and Class 3, 5 under Class 4, and 10  under  Class  5.    Other  weed  seeds  refer  to  "all  seeds  in  a  mixture  that  are  not  considered  noxious and are not crop seeds (White et al., 1993, p. 93).  There were, however, no aquatic  plants distributed by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries listed on the WSO.      The current legislative framework of Canada appears to be more focused on addressing the  importation of plant pests that are mainly agricultural or forestry related.  In view of this, it  would suggest that the legislation pertaining to the importation or introduction of IAS are  not effective, thus creating an obstacle in controlling the establishment and spread of these  species.

2.5  Risk assessment  
Risk assessment is defined as the identification, characterization, and quantification of risk  (Slovic,  1987).    Risk,  on  the  other  hand,  has  two  meanings  depending  on  the  context  in  which  it  is  used.    First,  risk  can  refer  to  a  hazard  or  a  danger  and  second,  the  chance  of  experiencing a loss or an unfavourable outcome (Whyte and Burton, 1980).  Risk can also  be  defined  as  the  probability  of  the  event  happening  (P)  times  the  magnitude  of  damage  should  it  happen  or  the  consequence  of  an  adverse  or  hazardous  event  (M)  (Whyte  and  Burton,  1980).    On  a  broader  scale  and  for  purposes  of  environmental  management,  risk  means  "a  hazard  or  danger  with  adverse,  probabilistic  consequences  for  man  or  his  environment" (Whyte and Burton, 1990, p. 3).      Suter (1993, p. 34) reports that there are several advantages of using risk assessment in  environmental decisionmaking, such as:  providing  the  quantitative  bases  for  comparing  and  prioritizing  risks  and  a  systematic  means  of  improving  and  understanding  risks;  results  expressed  as  probabilities  acknowledges  uncertainty  in  predicting  future  environmental  states  and  thus  makes  the  assessment  more  credible;  estimating  clear  endpoints;  providing  a  means  for  parties  to  environmental  decisions  to  compare  the  implications  of  their  assumptions  and  data  rather  than  negotiating  on  the  basis  of  political clout; separating clearly the scientific process of estimating the magnitude  and  probability  of  effects  (risk  analysis)  from  the  process  of  choosing  among  alternatives and determining acceptability of risks (risk management).    There  are  two  categories  of  risk  assessment:  retroactive  and  predictive  assessments  (Newman  and  Unger,  2003).    Retroactive  assessment  deals  with  an  existing  condition  whereas predictive assessment deals with a planned or proposed condition (Newman and  Unger,  2003).    The  process  of  risk  assessment  involves  three  components:  risk  identification,  risk  estimation,  and  risk  evaluation.    Both  risk  identification  and  risk  estimation aims to gather information on: "the nature and extent of the source, the chain of  events, pathways and processes that connect the cause to the effects, and the relationship  between  the  characteristics  of  the  impact  (dose)  and  the  types  of  response  (effects)"  (Whyte and Burton, 1990, p. 41).

Risk evaluation is where decisions are made about the meaning and suitability of the risk  probabilities  and  consequences  derived  (Whyte  and  Burton,  1990).    Kates  (1978)  in  discussing  risk  assessment  reported  that  the  three  main  elements,  identification,  estimation, and evaluation, were not distinct categories but overlapped (Figure 7).  Further,  risk assessment also included social evaluation, which is geared to "avoid some risk at all  costs  (aversive  risk),  balance  some  risks  with  others  (balanced  risk),  or  weigh  the  risks  encountered  with  benefits  obtained  (benefitrisk)  and  with  other  costs  (costbenefit)"  (Kates, 1978, p. 12).

2.5.1  CFIA and risk assessment  
In  Canada,  plant  health  risk  assessments  are  carried  out  by  the  Plant  Health  Risk  Assessment  (PHRA)  Unit  for  the  CFIA.    The  risk  assessments  are  conducted  in  order  to  determine if commodities entering Canada are carrying pests, diseases, or weeds that could  become  established  in  Canada  (CFIA,  2009).    Risk  assessments  are  also  carried  out  for  species that have the potential to become a quarantine pest in Canada.  The assessment is  conducted based on the biology of the organism and whether it would be able to live and  survive in Canada (CFIA, 2009).    

57 

 

Risk assessments are conducted in accordance with the IPPC, particularly, ISPM No. 11 (K.  Pauk,  pers.  comm.,  2011)  (Appendix  2).    Under  this  ISPM,  there  are  three  main  stages  to  conducting  an  assessment  or  a  PRA:  process  initiation,  risk  assessment,  and  risk  management  (FAO,  2006).    In  process  initiation,  the  pest(s)  are  identified  that  require  phytosanitary  measures  and/or  the  pathway  of  concern  that  represents  a  potential  pest  hazard  (FAO,  2006).    Under  risk  assessment  (stage  2),  there  are  three  areas  to  be  addressed:  pest  categorization,  assessment  of  the  probability  of  introduction  and  spread,  and  assessment  of  potential  economic  consequences  inclusive  of  environmental  impacts  (FAO, 2006).    Factors  considered  in  pest  categorization  are:  pest  identification,  presence  or  absence  in  the  PRA  area  (in  this  case,  Canada),  regulatory  status,  potential  for  establishment  and  spread in the PRA area, and potential for economic and environmental consequences in the  PRA area (FAO, 2006).  Upon completion of this step, if a pest is deemed a quarantine pest,  the next step, assessment of the probability of introduction and spread is conducted.  If the  pest is not deemed a quarantine pest, the PRA can be halted (FAO, 2006).    Assessment  of  the  probability  of  introduction  and  spread  examines  several  aspects:  pathway  analysis  (e.g.  areas  of  entry),  survival  during  transport,  storage  or  pest  management  procedures,  transference  to  a  suitable  host,  availability,  quantity  and  distribution of hosts in the PRA area, potential adaptation of the pest, reproductive strategy  of the pest, pest survival methods, cultural practices and control measures, environmental  suitability,  and  probability  of  spread  after  establishment  amongst  others  (FAO,  2006).   Finally, in the assessment of potential economic consequences, there is an examination of  pest  effects  (direct  and  indirect),  and  an  analysis  of  the  consequences  (e.g.  economical,  commercial, environmental, and noncommercial) (FAO, 2006).    In  the  third  stage,  risk  management,  the  conclusion  from  stage  2  (PRA)  is  used  to  determine whether risk management is required as well as the strength of the measures to  be  used  (FAO,  2006).    Other  areas  examined  include  level  of  acceptable  risk,  and  identification  of  appropriate  management  options  (FAO,  2006).    Daehler  and  Denslow 
58 

 

(2007)  quoting  C.  Wilson  O'Driscoll  (pers.  comm.)  reported  that  the  risk  assessment  process  used  by  CFIA  is  similar  to  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture's  (USDA)  Animal  and  Plant  Health  Inspection  Service  (APHIS).    The  USDA  APHIS  uses  a  qualitative  pest risk assessment that determines whether or not a plant species should be listed or de listed from the respective legislation.  In the case of the USA, it would be their noxious weed  regulations  (Appendix  3).    This  assessment  uses  eight  basic  steps:  documenting  the  initiating event, identifying and citing previous risk assessments, establishing the identity  of  the  weed,  verifying  the  quarantine  pest  status,  assessing  the  economic  and  environmental  importance,  assessing  likelihood  of  introduction,  determining  pest  risk  potential, and documenting the PRA (USDA APHIS, 2004).      The eight steps are used in conjunction with five risk elements: potential habitat suitability,  reproduction and spread, economic harm, ecological harm, and likelihood of introduction.   Each risk element is rated high, medium, low, or negligible, which has a preassigned score  (i.e.  3,  2,  1,  and  0).    Finally,  scores  are  calculated  for  consequences  of  introduction  and  likelihood of introduction and then an overall score of pest risk potential is derived (USDA  APHIS, 2004).  This overall score serves to inform the decision of whether to allow or deny  a plant from being imported (Daehler and Denslow, 2007).  There are however, drawbacks  to this type of assessment.  It is, for example, time consuming.  Daehler and Denslow (2007,  p.  39)  further  noted  that  "there  are  no  data  on  which  to  judge  how  well  the  APHIS  risk  assessment procedure excludes true pest plants and allows entry of nonpests ... the APHIS  system has never been tested by evaluating known pests and nonpests and calculating the  rates of correct decisions."     Notwithstanding the type of risk assessment process used by the CFIA, these assessments  are  not  conducted  on  a  regular  basis  especially  for  aquatic  plants  being  imported  into  Canada  (C.  Wilson  O'Driscoll,  pers.  comm.,  2011).    This  action  is  contrary  to  one  of  the  critical strategic goals listed in the  Invasive  Species  Strategy  of  Canada, which is to "ensure  that  risk  assessments  are  conducted  of  all  pathways  and  potential  pathways  of  unintentional  introductions,  including  commodities  and  transportation  vectors,  and  all  proposed introductions of alien species and all currently traded alien species" (GOC, 2004, 
59 

 

p.  22).    There  is,  however,  an  interim  arrangement  that  the  CFIA  will  conduct  risk  assessments on aquatic plants pursuant to a request from the Department of Fisheries and  Oceans (DFO) (C. Wilson O'Driscoll, pers. comm., 2011).      Between 1998 and 2002, 93 plants permits were issued by the CFIA.  However, importers  were  not  asked  the  purpose  of  the  plant  introduction  and  no  permits  have  been  issued  since 2002.  In addition, risk assessments were only conducted if the plant being imported  had  not  been  previously  recorded  in  Canada  (CFIA,  pers.  comm.,  2010).    In  2007,  an  advisory was released by the CFIA regarding a review of their policy on aquatic plants as  part of the Government of Canada's initiative on IAS (Appendix 4).  Fourteen plants were  listed that require risk assessments prior to introduction.  Of the 14 species listed, only two  risk assessments have been written: for water chestnut in 2001 and yellow floating heart in  2008.    It  is  important  to  note  that  the  remaining  plants  on  the  list  have  already  been  recorded within Ontario (Liu  et  al., 2008; Marson  et  al., 2009).  Risk assessments have also  been completed for  Cabomba (2001) and didymo or rock snot (Didymosphenia  geminata)  (2009).  Appendix 5 illustrates the executive summary of the risk assessments conducted  for Cabomba, water chestnut, and yellow floating heart.        

2.6  Link between literature review and methodology  
In 1996, Mack recommended that several approaches be formulated to determine the traits  of  a successful  aquatic  plant invader  within the  Greater  Toronto  Area  (GTA).   The  GTA  is  defined as the city of Toronto and the surrounding regional municipalities of York, Halton,  Peel, and Durham (City of Toronto, 2011).  The approaches to be used in the research were  guided  based  on  the  themes  used  in  the  literature  review,  namely:  pathways  of  introduction  for  aquatic  plants,  invasion  success  of  aquatic  plants,  specifically,  traits  of  successful  aquatic  plant  invaders,  and  the  legislative  framework  for  the  introduction  of  aquatic plants into Ontario.      The  pathways  of  introduction  for  aquatic  plants  revealed  that  the  aquarium  and  ornamental pond industries are responsible for the continued introduction and spread of 
60 

 

IAS, especially aquatic plants.  For this reason, the first approach to be taken is to identify  the aquatic plants being introduced by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries.  The  second approach was defined based on the legislative framework in Canada as the current  system does not effectively address the introduction of IAS.  Accordingly, the approach to  be taken is to discover the opportunities of introduction for aquatic plants.  Finally, from  the  literature  presented  on  the  traits  of  aquatic  plant  invaders,  there  is  still  a  level  of  inconclusiveness  about  what  traits  contribute  to  their  success.    In  order  to  contribute  to  this  knowledge  gap,  the  third  approach  to  be  taken  is  to  ascertain  the  traits  that  make  aquatic plant invaders successful.

3.0  METHODOLOGY 
 

3.1  Selection of potential aquatic plant invaders  
A thorough review of literature was conducted to compile a list of potential aquatic plant  invaders distributed by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries (e.g. Hiscock, 2003;  Thierry and Piednor, 2005; Hargreaves, 2006; Cohen et al., 2007; Marson et al., 2009; GISD,  n.d.).    The  species  selected  represented  all  three  growth  types  of  aquatic  species,  namely  floating, emergent and submerged and were not restricted by their native origin (e.g. Asia,  North  America,  and  South  America)  or  by  their  potential  to  be  invasive.    The  origin  and  invasiveness  of  the  plants  were  also  noted.    Opting  for  aquatic  plants  that  denoted  all  growth  types,  diverse  origins,  and  invasiveness,  ensured  that  no  particular  feature  was  eliminated  from  the  dataset  that  would  be  later  used  to  determine  the  attributes  of  a  successful  invader.    This  initial  list  represented  several  of  the  potential  aquatic  plant  candidates  that  may  be  released  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries,  aquarists, and ornamental pond (water garden) enthusiasts into  the natural environment  either accidentally or deliberately.    

3.2  Determining likelihood of introduction 
Two proxies were used to determine the possibility of introduction of aquatic plants into  the  natural  environment:  volume  of  sales  and  usage  (indoor  aquaria  and  outdoor  ornamental ponds).  The premise was that the higher the volume of sales, the greater the  use  of  the  plant  in  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds,  the  greater  the  probability  of  the  plant being released into the new environment.      Data on the volume of sales and usage of aquatic plants were obtained from stores that sell  aquatic  plants  for  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds.    These  stores  were  identified  using  the  GTA  Aquarium  Online  Store  Listing  and  Yellow  Pages  Canada  category  listings  "aquariums"  and  "water  gardens".    For  each  category  listing,  the  location  was  selected  in  order  to  identify  the  stores  for  that  section  of  the  GTA.    The  individual  lists  were  then  merged and a final list of stores that sold aquatic plants was generated.  Other stores were 
62 

 

also suggested by store owners.  In total, 78 stores were identified that sold aquatic plants  for aquariums and ornamental ponds.  These stores were contacted via telephone in order  to confirm if they sold aquatic plants.  Upon verification that a store sold aquatic plants, the  name of the manager and/or owner was ascertained and recorded.  The managers and/or  owners of the 62 stores identified as selling aquatic plants were sent letters of introduction  that outlined the nature of the research and how the stores could participate (e.g. provide a  list of aquatic plants sold, volume of sales, or a customer survey).  Responses were received  from  35  stores  on  the  volume  of  sales  and/or  usage  of  aquatic  plants  (response  rate  of  56.4%).         The list of aquatic plants sold by the stores was merged with the inventory of aquatic plants  obtained  from  the  literature  review.    Thus,  creating  a  final  list  of  potential  aquatic  plant  invaders distributed by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries within the GTA.  For  those  stores  that  agreed  to  provide  information  on  the  volume  of  sales  of  aquatic  plants,  annual data was requested.  The provision of annual data was not possible for some stores.   In  these  cases,  volume  of  sales  was  provided  daily,  weekly,  biweekly,  monthly  or  half yearly.  Sales reported daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly and halfyearly were extrapolated  to annual sales.    

3.3  Survey of aquarium and ornamental pond customers 
A survey was conducted to gather data from customers that buy and/or use aquatic plants  from the aforementioned aquarium and ornamental pond stores (Appendix 6).  The survey  was  designed  to  collect  data  on  the  use,  source  of,  and  disposal  of  aquatic  plants,  which  would  reflect  the  consumers'  contribution  to  the  spread  of  potential  aquatic  invaders.   Approximately 600 customers were targeted to complete the questionnaires.  The sample  size  was  determined  using  an  online  survey  tool,  The  Survey  System.    For  the  survey  of  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  customers,  a  95%  confidence  level  and  a  confidence  interval  of  4  were  used.    The  confidence  interval  (CI)  or  the  margin  of  error  provides  information  on  the  degree  of  accuracy  within  which  a  population  parameter  has  been  estimated  (Evans,  1992).    The  CI  uses  a  lower  and  an  upper  limit  (Â±)  within  which  the 
63 

 

population parameter is expected to lie in relation to the confidence interval (Evans, 1992).   Ideally,  a  large  sample size would  ensure  that  responses received  from  the  survey  would  accurately reflect the population.  The unstated rule is that the larger the sample size, the  smaller the CI.  In the case of the GTA, a sample size of 600 allows one to have a CI of Â±4  with  a  confidence  of  95%.    This  number,  while  not  ideal,  was  considered  to  be  representative of the population of the GTA, given the time frame in which to complete and  analyze the survey data.      In view of the sample size and the number of stores targeted, each store would receive 10  questionnaires.    Initially,  two  of  the  62  stores  agreed  to  participate  in  the  survey.    They  each took 20 questionnaires for a period of two months.  Of the 40 questionnaires issued,  only 4 were completed.  The remaining stores declined to participate in the survey.  As a  result, the survey was discontinued.  In order to obtain data on the source and disposal of  aquatic plants, surveys conducted by Marson et al. (2009a, b) on aquarium and ornamental  ponds within Canada were used.   

3.4  Determining characteristics of selected aquatic plants 
As  previously  discussed  in  Section  2.3.2,  aquatic  plant  invaders  use  morphological,  reproductive, and physiological strategies that allow them to be successful in invading new  environments  (Table  4).    In  order  to  determine  the  attributes  of  potential  aquatic  plant  invaders, quantifiable species traits or variables had to be identified.  These variables were  identified by looking at the traits listed under each strategy and categorizing them by those  particular traits (Table 6).  In some cases, two or more traits of a successful aquatic invader  as presented in Table 4 were conflated to be investigated in determining the common traits  of  a  successful  invader.    For  example,  morphologically,  aquatic  plant  invaders  have  been  reported to be either annuals or perennials.  Both terms relate to the life cycle of a plant; as  such, life cycle is a variable that can be examined as a morphological attribute of a potential  invader.    A  similar  approach  was  taken  for  the  remainder  of  the  morphological  and  reproductive traits.     

64 

 

For  the  physiological  traits,  since  aquatic  plant  invaders  are  tolerant  of  a  variety  of  environmental conditions, environmental parameters were used to determine if a specific  parameter promoted invasion success.  Physiologically, aquatic plant invaders also exhibit  plasticity,  which  is  a  response  to  the  environment  they  are  in.    For  this  reason,  plant  features and flowering period were used to determine a physiological response.  In total, 29  traits  were  identified  to  obtain  information  of  each  aquatic  plant  distributed  by  the  aquarium and ornamental pond industries in the GTA.      Table 6:  Attributes observed to identify potential aquatic plant invaders 
Morphological traits  Free floating habit   Perennials or annuals  Reproductive traits  Uses vegetative (asexual) and/or sexual reproduction       Large number of vegetative propagules produced      Regenerate asexually using vegetative hibernating  organs   Efficient dispersal mechanisms (water and/or wind)       Dioecious or monoecious   Large number of seeds produced for longrange  dispersal   Physiological traits  Tolerant of a wide variety of environmental   conditions   Rapid vegetative growth   Morphological plasticity   Phenotypic plasticity  Attributes to be observed  Growth form  Life cycle  Attributes to be observed Number of reproductive strategies used Number of propagation strategies used  Type of propagation strategies used  Number of vegetative propagules  produced per biomass  Type of vegetative propagule used    Number of dispersal mechanisms  employed by plant  Type of dispersal mechanism used   Breeding system  Number of seeds or spores produced  per biomass  Attributes to be observed Temperature, light suitability, salinity,  nutrient content, pH  Growth rate  Number of phenotypic forms produced  Plant features (i.e. stem length, stem  width, leaf length, leaf width, flower  length, flower width, fruit length, fruit  width, fruit type, seed size, time to  flower) 

  For each aquatic plant, information on the variables was obtained by means of a thorough  literature  review.    In  the  case  of  aquatic  plants  that  were  cultivars,  information  on  these  was  recorded  and  researched  based  on  their  genus  (e.g.  Crinum  spp.).    The  underlying 
65 

 

assumption  was  that  there  would  be  a  paucity  of  information  on  the  biological  traits  of  these plants.  Of note, a genus could represent any given number of cultivars; for example,  Nymphaea spp. represented approximately 70 cultivars.      While  information  on  the  plant's  biological  traits  was  being  obtained,  two  issues  arose.   First,  some  stores  were  not  aware  of  the  scientific  names  of  the  plants  sold  and  only  provided common names.  When this occurred, the scientific name of the plant was found  using the common name.  It was found, however, that the common name of the plant did  not accurately identify the plant being investigated.  An ideal example was the Java moss.   In the aquarium industry, Java moss is known both as Vesicularia dubyana and Taxiphyllum  barbieri.  For years, this plant was known as V. dubyana until 1982 when it was reclassified  (Tan  et  al.,  2005); however, this plant is still traded under its former name.  In instances  when the common name did not match the scientific name, the species was flagged, and the  correct  scientific  name  confirmed  using  The  Integrated  Taxonomic  System  (ITIS),  and  The  PLANTS Database.       In order to avoid further confusion in using common names, the plant's scientific name was  used to obtain information on the biological traits.  Conversely, based on the literature, it  became apparent that the scientific names of some of the plants had changed.  Accordingly,  a verification of the botanical nomenclature was conducted using the taxonomic databases,  Tropicos,  International  Plant  Name  Index (IPNI) and ITIS.  The verification was conducted  by  inputting  the  scientific  name  of  the  aquatic  plant  as  sold  in  the  aquarium  and  ornamental pond industries into the databases.  The search was also conducted using the  genus  of  the  species.    For  Tropicos  and  ITIS,  the  current  botanical  name  was  marked  as  "legitimate" or "accepted" respectively.  In the case of IPNI, the scientific name was listed  along with its synonym and basionym.           

  3.4.1  Data analysis 
Of  the  29  aforementioned  traits,  13  were  categorical  variables.    Some  of  the  categorical  variables  were  bimodal  (e.g.  breeding  system)  and  some  were  divided  into  multiple 
66 

 

categories  (e.g.  life  cycle,  growth  form,  number  of  seeds,  type  of  dispersal  mechanisms,  growth rate, fruit type, time to flower, light, salinity, and nutrient content).  In some cases,  each  category  represented  a  range  in  the  trait  (e.g.  temperature  (range),  and  pH).    For  example,  the  pH  of  a  particular  aquatic  plant  was  calculated  using  composite  pH  ranges  obtained  from  the  extensive  literature  review  conducted.    Categorical  variables  were  numerically coded (e.g. 1 or 2) to permit inclusion in regression analysis (Appendix 7).    Of the 16 remaining traits, 11 were continuous variables.  These variables were: number of  dispersal mechanisms used, stem length, stem width, leaf length, leaf width, flower length,  flower  width,  fruit  length,  fruit  width,  seed  length,  and  seed  width.    For  the  stem,  leaf,  flower,  fruit  and  seed  lengths  and  widths,  the  average  of  the  range  given  (e.g.  1.2Â­10cm  long = 5.6cm long) or the actual measurement (e.g. 12cm long) was recorded.  In terms of  temperature, the values were recorded as a minimum and a maximum in order to ascertain  the growth temperature of the aquatic plants.      The propagation strategies used by the aquatic plants were divided into four categories: A  and B, C, D and E, which are described below.   Categories A and B = species that produced daughter plants from the fragments or  whole of roots, rhizomes, or runners (initially separate categories, merged prior to  analysis);      Category C = species that produced daughter plants from offshoots of above ground  mass (e.g. offshoots, side shoots, sprig, budding, and adventitious shoots);  Category  D  =  species  that  produced  daughter  plants  from  fragments  of  above  ground  mass  (e.g.  fragments,  cuttings,  division  of  tufts  or  stem,  or  adventitious  plantlets); and     In association with the variable, type of vegetative propagule used, the four categories (A to  E)  were  populated  using  a  presence  (Y/N)  approach,  where  presence  of this  propagation  strategy was coded Y and absence coded N.   
67 

Category E = species that produced daughter plants from seed or spore. 

 

The three remaining traits: number of reproductive strategies used, number of phenotypic  forms  produced,  and  number  of  vegetative  propagule  produced  per  biomass,  were  excluded at the onset as they did not provide enough information that allowed for a clear  differentiation  between  the  species  and  therefore,  would  limit  the  number  of  cases  that  could  be  included  in  the  analysis.    A  similar  approach  was  taken  with  the  variables  stem  width, leaf width, flower width, fruit width, and seed width.       

3.5  Grouping of aquatic plants 
In  order  to  determine  if  there  were  any  common  traits  between  the  aquatic  plants  distributed  within  the  GTA,  the  plants  were  divided  into  three  categories:  alien  aquatic  plants  (Category  1),  native  aquatic  plants  (Category  2),  and  cosmopolitan  aquatic  plants  (Category 3) based on their origin.  Categories 1 and 2 were further subdivided into aquatic  invaders and aquatic noninvaders since not all alien plants are invasive and native plants  to Canada can be invasive elsewhere (Figure 8).  Invasive and noninvasive aquatic plants  were verified based on the thorough literature review that was conducted.       There were four final identifiable groups included in the analysis of common traits, groups  into  which  the  aquatic  plants  sold  within  the  GTA  could  be  placed:  Group  1    alien  and  invasive  (AI),  Group  2    alien  and  noninvasive  (ANI),  Group  3    native  and  invasive  (NI),  and  Group  4    native  and  noninvasive  (NNI).    Group  identity  served  as  a  categorical  (or  grouping) variable in logistic regression analysis described below (Appendix 7).

3.6  Statistical analysis 
Logistic regression  analysis  included  group identity  as  a categorical variable  and  initially,  the  21  traits  described  above  as  independent  or  predictive  variables  (i.e.  predictive  of  group  identity  in  the  regression  model).    Logistic  regression  analysis  and  all  other  statistical analysis described below were performed using SYSTAT version 13 (Systat, Inc.,  Chicago, IL).          Continuously  distributed  variables  (stem,  leaf,  flower,  fruit,  and  seed  lengths  as  well  as  volume of sales) were tested for normality of distribution (KolmogorovSmirnov Lilliefors  tests), and to determine the appropriateness of inclusion in linear regression models.  Data  were transformed as necessary (log (value+1)) to meet these assumptions.  Subsequently,  multivariate  statistical  analysis,  specifically,  logistic  regression  modelling  (LRM)  was  conducted.  The LRM is a predictive tool used to discover the bestfit model that describes  the  relationship  between  a  dependent  (outcome  or  response)  variable  and  a  set  of  independent  (predictor,  explanatory)  variables  or  covariates  (Hosmer  and  Lemeshow,  2000).  Described more simply, the LRM has the ability to use continuous, categorical, or a  mixture  of  categorical  and  continuous  variables  to  predict  a  discrete  outcome.    In  most 
69 

 

cases, the relationship being tested is between a categorical (outcome) dependent variable  and one or more categorical or continuous (predictor) variables (Peng et al., 2002).      In this research, the dependent variable was the aquatic plant groupings (group identity)  and  the  predictor  variables  were  the  plant  traits  and  sales  volume.    The  aquatic  plant  groupings  were  selected  as  the  dependent  variable  since  the  aim  of  the  research  is  to  determine  what  common  traits  distinguish  a  successful  invader  from  other  groups  of  aquatic  plants,  particularly  alien  aquatic  plants  that  are  not  successful  invaders.   Multinomial  logistic  regression  modelling  (MLRM)  was  performed  iteratively,  with  the  initial iteration including all predictor variables, and with subsequent iterations removing  the  predictor  variable  with  the  least  contribution  to  the  model's  predictive  power  (  =  0.15) in at least one pairwise group identity comparison (multinomial logistic regression  model).  In these analyses, with each iteration, a prediction success table was generated.      In order to achieve more effective discrimination between specific groups (here AI versus  ANI species), binomial logistic regression modelling (BLRM) was performed iteratively, as  above.    The  overall  predictive  value  of  the  BLRM  was  determined  from  the  prediction  success table generated with the final model.

4.0  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

4.1  Store data  
Sixtytwo  stores  that  sold  aquatic  plants  for  aquarium  and  ornamental  ponds  were  contacted in order to identify the aquatic plants sold, and the two proxies of introduction:  volume of sales and usage.  Of the 62 stores, 35 provided information on only the names of  the aquatic plants sold whereas 20 provided information on both the names of the aquatic  plants sold and the volume of sales.   

4.1.1  Aquatic plants sold  
The preliminary list of potential aquatic plant invaders compiled from published literature  revealed that there were 161 taxa that could be sold by the stores in the GTA.  The store  data, however, revealed that there were 642 taxa that were sold (Appendix 8).  The large  difference between the two lists indicates that there are significantly more taxa in the trade  that  are  not  documented  by  the  literature  that  could  be  released  into  the  natural  environment  either  accidentally  or  deliberately  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries, aquarists and ornamental pond enthusiasts.         Of the 642 taxa sold, 265 were cultivars.  In view of the underlying assumption that there  would be a paucity of information on the biological traits of cultivars, 212 of these species  were consolidated under their respective genera.  Following this consolidation, the number  of taxa was reduced to 430.  Since some of the scientific names of the taxa had changed, a  taxonomic  consolidation  was  done.    This  consolidation  involved  combining  the  two  or  more names under which a single species (or taxon) was sold.  As a result, the number of  taxa was reduced to 388.  Another reduction occurred as 40 taxa were excluded due to a  lack  of  sales  volume  data,  thus  resulting  in  a  final  number  of  348,  which  were  used  to  determine the traits of a successful invader (Appendix 9).

4.1.2  Volume of sales of aquatic plants sold  
The research operated on the premise that the higher the volume of sales, the greater the  probability  of  the  taxa  being  released  into  the  new  environment.    A  total  of  331,857  individual  plants  were  sold  per  year  by  the  20  stores  reporting  sales  volume  in  the  GTA  (Appendix 10).  Sales volume data were grouped (Figure 9).  Three invasive species were  identified  that  had  the  highest  volume  of  sales  (10,00050,000  plants  per  year)  and  greatest potential for release into the environment (Figure 9).  These were water hyacinth,  water  lettuce,  and  hornwort.    Conversely,  115  taxa  sold  by  the  20  stores  had  the  lowest  volume of sales (150 plants per year) and the least potential for release.  The remaining  taxa, based on the volume of sales, would have an intermediate potential for release.      Any taxa with sales volume greater than 500 plants per year may be assumed would also  have  a  high  probability  of  release  into  the  environment.    Based  on  the  volume  of  sales  reported by the 20 stores, 100 taxa had volumes >500 plants per year and therefore, have a  high probability of being released either accidentally or deliberately.  Of these 100 taxa, 55  were  alien  noninvasive,  28  invasive  (alien  and  native),  16  native  noninvasive,  and  1  cosmopolitan.    The  invasive  taxa  with  the  highest  probability  of  being  released  into  the  environment are presented in Table 7.    

4.1.3  Use of aquatic plants  
The survey instrument designed for this research sought to determine the consumer's role  in the spread of potential invaders.  However, due to limited participation, the survey was  discontinued.    In  order  to  gain  an  understanding  about  the  consumer's  role,  data  from  Marson (2009a, b) was used as a proxy to discuss the use, source and disposal of aquatic  plants for aquariums and ornamental ponds.

Higher  volume  of  sales  not  only  increases  the  probability  of  taxa  being  released  into  the  new environment but also implies greater use of taxa in aquariums and ornamental ponds.   Marson  et  al.  (2009a,  b)  reported  data  compiled  from  1,669  completed  surveys  of  whom  794  persons  owned  aquariums  and  359  owned  ornamental  ponds.    These  survey  participants were from across Canada.  The survey found extensive use of invasive taxa for  aquariums and ornamental ponds.  Although these studies did not examine volume of sales  but  frequency  of  occurrence,  several  of  the  invasive  taxa  listed  in  Table  7  were  used  by 
74 

 

more  than  80  respondents  in  the  survey,  which  indicates  a  relatively  high  use  of  these  species.  These taxa were Cabomba, which was used by 85 respondents, water hyacinth 286  respondents,  water  lettuce  246  respondents,  hornwort  214  respondents,  parrot  feather  115 respondents and duckweed (Lemna minor) 170 respondents (Marson et al., 2009a, b).    The number of invasive taxa bought and/or used per year was calculated using the volume  of sales, the number of persons that buy a specific taxon, and the total number of persons  that have aquariums and ornamental ponds.  This calculated figure is also equivalent to the  maximum  number  of  plants  in  each  taxon  that  could  be  released  into  the  natural  environment each year either deliberately or accidentally.  This does not suggest, of course,  that  this  number  will  be  released  each  year,  but  the  relative  magnitudes  are  expected  to  correspond with relative risk of release into the environment.  As previously indicated, of  the  1,669  survey  respondents  within  Canada  that  buy  and/or  use  taxa  for  aquarium  and  ornamental ponds (Marson  et  al., 2009a, b), 286 persons used water hyacinth (Marson  et  al., 2009a, b).  Based on the average sales volume per customer, 5,592 water hyacinths are  purchased and/or used per year in the GTA, representing the number that can potentially  be  released  into  the  environment.    Aside  from  water  hyacinth,  the  top  five  invasive  taxa  that could be released into the environment were water lettuce (2,982), hornwort (1,693),  Cabomba  (313),  and  Vallisneria  americana  (200).    With  the  exception  of  Vallisneria  americana and  Cabomba, the top three invasive taxa identified in this study based on sales  volume within the GTA were found to correspond with Marson's top three plants based on  frequency of occurrence.      

4.1.4  Source and disposal of aquatic plants  
The potential spread of invasive taxa as well as other taxa that are potential invaders (e.g.  alien plants that possess similar traits as invasives) by the aquarium and ornamental pond  industries is also linked to their source and disposal.  Cumulatively, Marson et al. (2009a, b)  found  that  the  main  sources  of  taxa  for  aquarium  and  ornamental  ponds  were  garden  centres or nurseries, pet stores, from a friend, and from the wild.  Other sources included  aquarium clubs, internet/mail order, trade shows or other (e.g. fish auctions) (Figure 10).  
75 

 

During  the  winter  or  when  taxa  were  no  longer  needed,  most  were  discarded  into  the  garbage or compost (Marson  et  al., 2009a, b).  Taxa were also left in the ornamental ponds,  brought indoors, given to others, released to the wild, or returned to the store (Figure 11).          

4.1.5  Status of aquatic plants sold in GTA  
The  348  taxa  included  in  the  logistic  regression  analysis  were  categorized  as  invasive  or  noninvasive.  For invasive taxa, two subcategories were alien and invasive (AI) and native  and invasive (NI).  Similarly, noninvasive plants were subcategorized.  There were 62 taxa  that were AI to Ontario and other parts of the world.  On the other hand, there were 11 that  were  native  to  Ontario  but  invasive  in  other  parts  of  the  world  (Figure  12).    The  list  of  invasive aquatic plants sold by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries in the GTA is  presented in Appendix 11.          

4.2  Multinomial logistic regression model 
The final multinomial LRM was able to successfully predict group identity 63% of the time  (Table  8).    The  model  was  operated  using  344  cases  with  Group  4  (AI)  acting  as  the  reference  group  for  paired  comparisons.    The  remaining  four  cases  represented  the  cosmopolitans,  which  were  excluded  prior  to  analysis  since  they  could  not  be  clearly  distinguished  into  alien  or  native  species  based  on  their  origin.    The  model  was  able  to  effectively resolve aquatic plants that were native and noninvasive (NNI) (Group 1) from  those  that  were  AI  (Group  4).    However,  the  model  was  generally  poor  at  discriminating  between  Groups  2  (NI)  and  4  (AI).    This  poor  discrimination  between  NI  and  AI  is  not  surprising if it is assumed that invasive species, regardless of geographic origin, have some  shared traits.  More problematic was the low success in correctly distinguishing between  alien noninvasive (ANI) species and AI species, as the ability to distinguish traits in alien  species  that  will  likely  lead  to  invasion  success  versus  traits  that  are  unlikely  to  lead  to  success would benefit, for example, habitat protection.

4.2.1  NNI versus AI  

Four  variables  were  considered  most  important  in  distinguishing  between  NNI  and  AI  (p<0.05).    These  were  types  of  propagation  strategy  used,  number  of  propagation  strategies used, growth rate, and minimum temperature (Table 9).  The variables time to  flower  and  pH  were  marginally  significant  (p=0.059  and  p=0.121  respectively)  in  distinguishing  NNI  and  AI.    For  purposes  of  discussion,  variables  with  p<0.15  are  considered as marginally significant.

Generally,  production  of  new  plants  from  offshoots  of  above  ground  biomass  or  from  fragments  (Categories  C  and  D)  were  traits  more  commonly  associated  with  AI  species  (34/62 and 30/62 taxa exhibiting these traits, respectively) than with NNI species (16/46  and  11/46  taxa  exhibiting  these  traits,  respectively).    AI  species  generally  had  more  propagation  strategies  per  taxa,  with  39/62  taxa  able  to  reproduce  by  three  or  more  different strategies.  Among NNI taxa only 19/46 had three or more propagation strategies.      AI  species  typically  had  higher  growth  rates,  with  59/62  species  in  moderate  or  high  growth  rate  categories  (36/62  classified  as  high  growth  rate),  whereas  NNI  species  had  only 31/46 taxa in the moderate and high growth rate categories (7/46 classified as high  growth rate).  NNI species were generally more cold tolerant that AI species, as indicated  by  minimum  growth  temperatures.    Among  the  native  taxa,  33/46  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <0Â°C,  and  39/46  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <10Â°C.    In  contrast,  only  16/62  AI  taxa  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <0Â°C,  and  31/62  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <10Â°C.    AI  taxa  generally  had  longer  flowering  periods,  with  10/62  taxa  capable  of  flowering  yearround.    None  of  the  native  taxa  are  capable  of  flowering  yearround.  Finally, AI species were generally tolerant of a broader pH range.  While both  AI taxa and NNI taxa were most commonly found in moderately acidic water, 27/62 alien  taxa can grow in neutral to moderately alkaline conditions, whereas only 7/46 of the native  taxa included in the aquarium trade grow under neutral conditions, and none grow under  moderately alkaline conditions.         

4.2.2  NI versus AI  
Minimum  temperature  was  the  only  variable  that  strongly  distinguished  NI  from  AI  (p<0.05)  (Table  10),  while  number  of  propagation  strategies  used  was  marginally  significant (p=0.073) in distinguishing between the Groups.      AI  taxa  were  generally  less  cold  tolerant  that  NI  taxa,  as  indicated  by  minimum  growth  temperatures.    Among  the  AI  taxa,  16/62  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <0Â°C,  and  31/62  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <10Â°C.    In  contrast,  only  6/11  NI  taxa  had  minimum growth temperatures <0Â°C, and 9/11 had minimum growth temperatures <10Â°C.   
81 

 

AI  taxa  commonly  had  more  propagation  strategies  per  taxa,  with  39/62  taxa  able  to  reproduce by three or more different strategies.  Among NI plants only 4/11 had three or  more propagation strategies.

4.3  Binary logistic regression model 
There  was  low  success  in  accurately  distinguishing  between  ANI  and  AI  taxa  in  the  multinomial  logistic  regression  model  as  displayed  in  Table  8.    The  ability  to  discern  the  traits that distinguish these groups is critical, especially in preventing invasions.  In order  to achieve this, the binary LRM (BLRM) was used as a better predictive tool to discriminate  specifically between these groups (in the absence of trying to discriminate among all four  groups  simultaneously).    The  BLRM  revealed  that  ANI  and  AI  taxa  can  be  effectively  discriminated 77% of the time using 287 cases in the analysis (Table 11).      The model also does a better job of classifying ANI as ANI (192/225 times) than classifying  AI  as  AI  (30/62  times).    However,  the  model  misclassified  AI  and  ANI  taxa,  32/62  times.   This  misclassification  has  management  implications,  especially  in  the  introduction  of  aquatic plants.  AI taxa can be imported or introduced if incorrect common names are used,  which has been shown to be unreliable in species identification.  AI introduction can also be  facilitated  through  the  continual  use  of  scientific  names  that  have  been  taxonomically  revised, plant identification only to the genus level (if no flower and/or fruit are present),  or  inaccurate  identification  at  the  species  level.    The  variables  that  allow  for  effective  discrimination were type of propagation strategies, number of propagation strategies used,  number  of  dispersal  mechanisms  used,  minimum  temperature,  and  volume  of  sales  of  aquatic plants (Table 12).  
82 

 

Volume of sales of aquatic plants was used in order to determine what characteristics of a  plant make them more likely to become invasive by examining not only biological traits but  opportunities  for  introduction.    Thus,  volume  of  sales  acts  as  a  proxy  for  opportunity  for  plants  to  become  invasive  through  release  into  the  environment.    It  is  therefore  appropriate  that  this  variable  be  included  in  the  analysis  along  with  biological  traits  as  a  factor that may make one species more likely to successfully invade.  One has to take into  consideration  that  some  plants  are  alien  but  not  invasive  just  because  they  do  not  have  high  sales  volume.    If  the  preference  patterns  of  consumers  change  and  given  their  biological traits, then some of these species may in fact become invasive.

In general, production of new plants from below ground biomass (Categories A and B) or  from seed (Category E) were traits commonly used by both AI taxa (51/62 and 54/62 taxa  exhibiting  these  traits,  respectively)  and  with  lower  frequency  in  ANI  taxa  (175/225  and  158/225  taxa  exhibiting  these  traits,  respectively).    AI  species  generally  had  more  propagation  strategies  per  taxa,  with  61/62  taxa  able  to  reproduce  by  two  or  more  different  strategies.    Among  ANI  taxa  only  188/225  had  two  or  more  propagation  strategies.    AI  species  typically  used  two  or  more  methods  of  dispersal  (48/62),  whereas  only 151/225 ANI species used more than one method of dispersal.  Further, AI taxa used  three or more methods of dispersal (43/62) more frequently than ANI taxa (49/225) that  used  similar  dispersal  methods.    Therefore,  a  higher  percentage  of  AI  taxa  use  three  or  more dispersal mechanisms than ANI taxa.    ANI taxa were generally less cold tolerant than AI species, as indicated by minimum growth  temperatures.  Among the ANI taxa, 26/225 had minimum growth temperatures <0Â°C, and  51/225  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <10Â°C.    In  contrast,  only  16/62  AI  taxa  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <0Â°C,  and  31/62  had  minimum  growth  temperatures  <10Â°C.  AI species were typically sold in relatively large numbers for the volume categories  101500  and  1,0015,000  taxa  (32/62).    Sixteen  AI  taxa  were  sold  per  year  in  these  categories, a smaller number of plants in comparison to the 28 AI that were sold with high  sales volume >500 plants per year (Table 7).  The 16 AI taxa sold per year in the volume  category  1,0015,000  coincided  with  those  already  listed  in  Table  7,  while  plants  sold  between  101500  per  year  (>100  inclusive)  are  presented  in  Table  13.      Among  the  ANI  taxa,  the  largest  numbers  sold  were  for  the  volume  categories  150  and  101500  (141/225).  AI taxa were sold for volumes greater than 10,000 (2/62) (water hyacinth and  water lettuce), whereas none were sold of the ANI.         

4.4  Traits of a successful invader 
Examination  of  the  biological  traits  that  distinguished  AI  from  ANI  revealed  that  type  of  propagation  strategy  used,  number  of  propagation  strategies  used,  number  of  dispersal  mechanisms employed per plant, and minimum temperature were the most important.  In 
84 

 

addition,  purchasing  decisions  by  consumers  contributed  to  invasion  success  (as  sales  volume  was  an  important  discriminator  between  AI  and  ANI  taxa).    The  aforementioned  biological attributes were mainly reproductive and physiological and were found to be in  agreement with other studies that identified these traits as contributing to the success of  aquatic invaders.  Unlike previous studies, volume of sales of aquatic plants was found to be  important by this research in determining the success of aquatic invaders (Table 14).

There were some traits, however, that did not prove to be important predictors of invasion  success; as such, it can be perceived that there is still a level of uncertainty with regards to  what traits actually determine a successful invader or that the generalized traits listed in  Table 14 may not all apply to the specific condition of an aquatic plant species in Ontario.   Nevertheless, unlike previous studies, this analysis was conducted on a very large sample  of taxa within a small group that is, aquatic plants, and as such, makes the findings of what  contributes to the success of an aquatic invader significant.  The distinguishing attributes  between AI and ANI will be discussed hereafter.               The propagation strategies used by both ANI and AI taxa were the production of new taxa  from  below  ground  biomass  and  seeds.    This  was  expected  since  successful  invaders  are  known  to  mainly  use  asexual  reproduction,  for  example,  production  of  vegetative  propagules and regeneration from fragments.  Most of the ANI and AI taxa used vegetative  propagules  such  as  turions,  tubers,  winter  buds,  rhizomes,  rootstock,  and  stolons.   However,  ANI  taxa  were  found  to  use  additional  vegetative  propagules  such  as  bulbs,  bulbils, corms, cormels, and cormlets, which were not observed in AI taxa.  Propagules are  mainly found underground, and serve to anchor the plant, store food reserves, and function  as hibernacula, thus allowing the taxa to survive unfavourable  conditions (e.g. winter) by  remaining  dormant  for  periods  of  time.    Sculthorpe  (1967)  concurred  when  he  reported  that  vegetative  propagules  functioned  as  hibernacula,  which  enabled  them  to  survive  periods  of  unfavourable  conditions.    The  likelihood  of  spread  of  ANI  and  AI  taxa  also  increases  as  both  produce  seeds  that  can  overwinter.    Comparable  to  below  ground  biomass, seeds are able to remain dormant for extensive periods of time until favourable  conditions arise.  In the case of ANI taxa, production of seeds that overwinter increases the  probability of these plants becoming successful invaders.          Another factor that increased the likelihood of ANI taxa becoming successful invaders was  the number of propagation strategies used.  AI and ANI taxa were found to use two or more  propagation strategies, which were expected since successful invaders tend to use one to  three propagation strategies (Table 14).  The research showed that AI taxa typically used  three propagation strategies whereas ANI taxa used two (Section 4.3).  This would indicate 
87 

 

that  AI  taxa  use  more  strategies  to  ensure  their  survival  and  spread  if  released  into  the  environment.    While ANI  taxa  use  fewer  propagation  strategies, it  is  actually  the  types  of  propagation strategies used that dictates their potential to become invaders.  As previously  discussed,  ANI  taxa  use  vegetative  propagules  and  seeds  that  are  able  to  survive  unfavourable  conditions.    Consequently,  the  presence  of  these  structures  increases  the  probability of ANI taxa becoming successful invaders.                   The  likelihood  of  invasion  also increases  with  the  number  of  dispersal  mechanisms  used.   In  the  literature,  successful  invaders  are  known  to  use  one  or  two  efficient  dispersal  mechanisms  (Table  14).    In  contrast,  the  research  revealed  that  AI  taxa  used  multiple  dispersal  mechanisms  (two  or  more),  which  would  increase  their  range  of  spread  and  potential to be released into the environment either deliberately or accidentally.  ANI taxa,  on the other hand, were found to use one or two dispersal mechanisms as described in the  literature.    While  ANI  taxa  utilized  fewer  dispersal  mechanisms  than  AI  taxa,  the  use  of  more  than  one  dispersal  method  increases  their  ability  to  spread  to  new  areas,  thus  increasing  the  area  in  which  they  could  become  potential  invaders.    Furthermore,  a  majority of these plants produce seeds and vegetative propagules that can be transported  over large distances by water, wind, animals (e.g. birds), and humans.  The role played by  vegetative propagules and seeds in the dispersal of species were described by Sculthorpe  (1967)  and  Spencer  and  Bowes  (1990).    Sculthorpe  (1967)  reported  that  vegetative  propagules were the most likely cause of the distribution of species worldwide since they  could be easily carried by floods, waterfowl, animals, and man.  Seed production, Spencer  and Bowes (1990) noted, aided in plant survival especially during adverse conditions and  improved the chances for successful invasion in a new area.        Aside from the aforementioned reproductive strategies, ANI taxa and to a lesser degree, AI  taxa have adapted tolerance to minimum temperatures as a physiological strategy in their  invasion success (Table 14).  Although minimum temperature was not individually listed in  the  literature,  it  still  influences  the  success  of  invaders.    Temperature,  for  instance,  has  been  regarded  as  a  key  climatic  factor  that  affects  aquatic  plants  (Lacoul  and  Freedman,  2006).  Both AI and ANI are able to tolerate temperatures <0Â°C and <10Â°C, which is likely 
88 

 

since some of the species distributed by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries are  temperate.   Not  only  are  these  species able  to  withstand  cold  temperatures, but  they  can  produce  overwintering  structures,  possibly  as  a  result  of  depleted  nutrient  supply  or  abnormal conditions (Sculthorpe, 1967).  In addition, some of these species are invasive in  other temperate countries or areas that have cold environments.  As a result, these plants  have  the  ability  to  survive  Ontario's  climate  and  become  invasive.    Examples  of  these  species are water hawthorn (Aponogeton distachyos), golden buttons (Cotula coronopifolia),  giant  pennywort  (Hydrocotyle  bonariensis),  Jussiaea  grandiflora,  snowflake  (Leucojum  aestivum), monkey flower (Mimulus  guttatus), water cress, yellow snowflake (Nymphoides  geminata),  floating  fern  (Salvinia  natans  or  Salvinia  auriculata),  and  white  arum  lily  (Zantedeschia aethiopica).  From the research, four other temperate AI taxa that are able to  become  established  in  Ontario  even  though  their  minimum  temperature  is  >10Â°C  are  Joseph's  coat  (Alternanthera  ficoidea),  Hygrophila  costata,  mondo  grass  (Ophiopigon  japonicus), and Sagittaria montevidensis.    Keller  and  Lodge  (2007)  expressed  concern  about  species  in  the  Great  Lakes  that  were  known to be invasive in temperate or colder environments and regarded them as potential  invaders.    The  species  observed  in  that  study  were  water  hawthorn,  chameleon  plant  (Houttuynia  cordata),  water  fern  (Marsilea  mutica),  mondo  grass,  greater  spearwort  (Ranunculus  lingua),  and  floating  fern.    Incidentally,  chameleon  plant  and  greater  spearwort  are  sold  for  aquarium  and  ornamental  ponds  in  the  GTA.    Other  species  observed  by  Keller  and  Lodge  to  have  temperate  zone  impacts  were  Cabomba,  Brazilian  waterweed,  manna  grass  (Glyceria  maxima),  European  frogbit,  yellow  iris,  moneywort  (Lysimachia  nummularia),  water  shamrock  (Marsilea  quadrifolia),  water  forgetmenot  (Myosotis  scorpioides),  parrot  feather,  Eurasian  watermilfoil,  lesser  naiad  (Najas  minor),  yellow  floating  heart,  curlyleafed  pondweed  (Potamogeton  crispus),  water  chestnut,  and  narrowleaved  cattail  (Typha  angustifolia).    With  the  exception  of  manna  grass,  Eurasian  watermilfoil and curlyleafed pondweed, all the other plants are sold by the aquarium and  ornamental pond industries in the GTA.

There is also the perception that tropical and subtropical species that are AI and ANI will  not negatively impact the environment if released, as these taxa are not expected to survive  Ontario's temperate climates to become invasive (CCFAM, 2004).  As such, this perception  may confer some sort of reassurance that potential invaders are not being introduced into  new environments.  This should not be the case as Rixon  et  al. (2005) pointed out in their  study that invasion histories and overwintering abilities play a role in the likely success of  invaders.    Moreover,  with  the  increasing  effects  of  climate  change,  there  is  an  increased  likelihood  that  tropical  and  subtropical  AI  and  ANI  taxa  could  become  established.    The  probability of success of the invasion process also increases since AI and ANI tropical and  subtropical  taxa  produces  seeds  and  vegetative  propagules  that  are  able  to  overwinter  and resist drying; thus giving them the advantage to survive in Ontario's temperate climate.   Case  in  point:  water  hyacinth  and  water  lettuce  usually  die  with  the  onset  of  colder  temperatures in the GTA.  Holm  et  al. (1997) reported that the vegetative tissues of these  species  are  susceptible  to  freezing  and  would  seldom  survive  the  winter  of  temperate  climates.  The use of the word "seldom" by Holm  et  al.  does not preclude a likely invasion.   Further, if the precautionary approach recommended by the CBD (2010) is to be applied,  then  one  may  infer  that  both  water  hyacinth  and  water  lettuce  have  the  potential  to  be  invasive in Ontario.                

4.4.1  Opportunity for introduction  
Aside  from  reproductive  and  physiological  strategies,  the  volume  of  sales  of  taxa  as  an  opportunity  of  introduction  differed  between  AI  and  ANI  taxa.    No  ANI  taxa  were  sold  in  volumes greater than 10,000, thereby suggesting that ANI taxa had the lesser potential of  being released into the environment.  Total store data gathered on volume of sales of taxa  revealed that 40% (25/62) of the AI taxa had a high volume of sales (>500 plants per year)  and  therefore,  the  highest  probability  of  being  released  into  the  environment.    Of  the  28,  water  hyacinth,  water  lettuce,  and  hornwort  along  with  Cabomba,  and  Vallisneria  americana  were  shown  to  be  the  top  five  invasive  taxa  based  on  volume  of  sales  (opportunity of introduction) (Table 14).     
90 

 

The  higher  volumes  of  AI  taxa  observed  suggests  that  using  volume  of  sales  of  aquatic  plants  as  a  proxy  of  opportunity  for  introduction  is  a  factor  that  clearly  distinguishes  AI  from  ANI  taxa.    This  distinction  is  not  because  people  choose  to  trade  in  AI  taxa,  but  because  high  trade  in  ANI  taxa  gives  them  greater  opportunity  to  be  released  into  the  environment.  Furthermore, high trade makes it more likely that ANI taxa would transition  from being ANI to AI based on the biological traits they possess.  The aforementioned five  AI taxa may be very invasive as they have the biological attributes that contribute to their  invasive  success.    In  addition,  they  may  be  well  liked  by  aquarists  and  ornamental  pond  enthusiasts  and  as  such,  are  traded  in  high  volumes.    Therefore,  it  is  not  surprising,  but  rather expected, that so many species with high sales volume were also invasive.          

4.5  The aquarium and ornamental pond industries 
In  view  of  the  fact  that  a  large  volume  of  taxa  are  sold  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  stores,  of  which  ANI  and  AI  taxa  are  the  most  dominant  (Figure  12),  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  remains  a  pathway  of  concern  for  the  introduction  of  AI  taxa  and  potential  invaders  into  Ontario.    From  the  literature, several authors had expressed concern about these industries as a source for the  introduction of AI (Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.3).  Seventythree AI taxa were recorded for sale  by  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  stores  in  the  GTA.    An  additional  12  were  observed  during the research, but lacked sales volume (Appendix 12).  Considering the high numbers  of AI taxa introduced by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries, these species have  a  high  potential  for  accidental  or  deliberate  release  into  the  natural  environment.    In  addition, the high numbers of AI and ANI taxa may indicate that these plants have specific  traits  (e.g.  fast  growth  rates  and  robustness)  that  are  favoured  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  but  which  encourage  invasivity  if  released  deliberately  or  accidentally into the environment.      While examining the aquatic plants sold by the aquarium and ornamental pond industries,  identifying  85  AI  taxa  is  by  far  the  highest  number  recorded  in  comparison  to  similar  studies  conducted  on  these  industries  in  Canada.    The  AI  numbers  observed  are 
91 

 

attributable to the small geographic area in which the research was conducted as well as  the  thorough  literature  review  performed  in  order  to  identify  the  species  that  were  invasive.  Funnell et al. (2009) recorded 11 invasive species in natural waters within major  cities  and  the  surrounding  regions  of  the  Lake  Ontario  basin.    These  species  were  also  identified  using  a  list  prepared  by  the  MNR  and  OFAH.    Like  Funnell  et  al.,  Marson  et  al.  (2009a, b)  recorded 11 species using the GISD.  Rixon  et  al. (2005) conducted research in  the  Great  Lakes  watershed  and  listed  nine  invasive  species.    Species  identification  was  conducted  using  only  three  references,  Mills  et  al.  (1993),  Baensch  and  Riehl  (1996)  and  Hiscock (2003).        The use and disposal of taxa for aquariums and ornamental ponds also contributes to the  likely spread of AI and ANI taxa (Section 4.1.4).  The majority of the taxa used in aquariums  and ornamental ponds were disposed of in the garbage or compost (Marson  et  al., 2009a,  b).  Discarding taxa in the garbage is in keeping with the disposal guidelines provided by  the  MNR  and  OFAH  (1996);  however,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  persons  are  completely  drying these species or freezing them prior to disposal.  As a result, there is the likelihood  that  live  AI  taxa  and  ANI  that  have  similar  traits  as  AI  are  unintentionally  being  released  into  the  natural  environment.    The  unintentional  release  of  AI  and  ANI  taxa  are  also  possible  by  persons  that  use  compost  or  overwinter  plants  in  their  ornamental  ponds.   Seeds  of  AI  taxa  are  able  to  withstand  drying  and  freezing  (MNR  and  OFAH,  1996),  also  whole plants can be transported to adjacent water bodies during flood events (Marson  et  al.,  2009a,  b).    The  enforcement  by  government  officials  of  the  proper  disposal  of  AI  and  ANI taxa, while important, will prove difficult and there is already limited enforcement that  prevents the release of illegal aquatic organisms (CCFAM, 2004).      The  sale  of  AI  and  ANI  taxa  for  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds  contradicts  the  government's desire to control the introduction and spread of these species in Canada as  expressed in the literature (CCFAM, 2004; GOC, 2004).  If the government wishes to control  the introduction and spread of AI taxa as well as species that have the potential to become  invaders, why are they allowed to enter the country?  Discussions held with the managers 

92 

 

and/or owners of the aquarium and ornamental pond stores during the research revealed  that few aquatic plants are grown locally while most are imported.      There was no rationale for the use and sale of ANI and AI taxa by aquarium and ornamental  pond stores during the research.  One could surmise that maybe the relevant agencies were  not  aware  that  these  taxa  were  being  sold.    However,  this  was  found  not  to  be  the  case,  since  most  of  the  aquatic  plants  used  by  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds  are  imported.   Further, knowledge on the sales of AI taxa for aquariums and ornamental ponds has been  reported from as far back as 1993 (Mills et  al., 1993).  Lack of knowledge on the impacts of  IAS was considered another reason.  This hypothesis was excluded as store owners and/or  managers have been asked to hand out brochures (ascertained during data collection) on  the use and disposal of aquatic plants for aquarium and ornamental ponds.  The provision  of brochures and other educational materials to the aquarium and ornamental pond stores  and,  indirectly,  consumers,  is  an  outreach  initiative  by  the  Invading  Species  Programme  (ISP)  (Funnell  et  al.,  2009).    The  brochure  contains  information  on  11  invasive  aquatic  plants and includes steps to prevent the spread of invasive taxa in general.  Ten of the 11  invasive  aquatic  plants  discussed  in  the  brochure  are  sold  by  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond stores in the GTA.     An additional hypothesis is that ANI taxa are more accessible, preferred by aquarium and  ornamental pond owners, or provide economic gain.  MNR and OFAH (1996) in their study  also found that there are "thousands" of exotic species and varieties of taxa that originated  from  other  parts  of  the  world,  added  beauty  and  diversity  to  home  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds,  and  were  accessible  to  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  enthusiasts.   The ease in which ANI taxa can be accessed poses a problem.  If, for instance, any of these  ANI  taxa  had  the  attributes  that  favoured  the  success  of  invasions  (as  previously  discussed),  and  were  released  into  the  environment,  the  likely  outcome  would  be  the  introduction  and  spread  of  a  potential  invader,  which  is  further  enhanced  given  the  ease  with which they can be purchased as well as their widespread use.  In terms of economic 

93 

 

gain, using the USA as the example5, Padilla and Williams (2004) reported that hobbyists in  the  USA  alone  supported  a  $25  billion  per  year  worldwide  industry.    If  this  substantial  amount of money can be earned from the sale of AI and ANI taxa, then there would be no  impetus to address the sale of these species; as such, the possible impacts of these species  on the environment would be ignored.         Another hypothesis is that owners of aquarium and ornamental ponds are not encouraged  to  buy  native  plants.    Of  the  62  stores  contacted  during  the  research,  only  four  sold  NNI  taxa.   The  limited  sale of  NNI  taxa  is  surprising  since  temperate  areas  are  reported  to  be  more species rich than tropical areas (Crow, 1993).  Therefore, there should be much more  NNI  taxa  available  to  the  public  for  use  in  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds.    Currently  13% of the plants sold for aquarium and ornamental ponds are NNI.  The MNR and OFAH  through  their  ISP  do  encourage  the  use  of  native  species  for  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds.  However, in light of the fact that AI and ANI taxa are still being sold by aquarium  and ornamental pond stores, it would appear that the programme is not effective.  Funnell  et  al.  (2009)  also  found  that  the  ISP  was  ineffective  as  they  reported  that  30%  of  the  retailers were supportive of the programme.  Support of the programme was mainly from  small  independently  run  operators  and  not  the  larger  retailers.    High  employee  turnover  rates  and  inexperienced  seasonal  staff  were  also  identitifed  as  factors  that  limited  the  effectiveness, continuity, and success of the programme.             From  the  literature,  it  was  concluded  that  the  legislative  framework  in  Canada  does  not  effectively  address  the  issue  of  IAS  (Section  2.4.1.2).    This  conclusion  is  further  substantiated with the continued sale of AI and ANI taxa.  ANI and AI taxa are introduced  using an import permit under the Plant Protection Act (1990).  Applicants for plant imports  are  required  to  provide  the  common  and  scientific  names  of  the  plant  being  imported,  purpose of importation (e.g. commercial or resale, educational, scientific purposes), source  of  import,  and  the  item  being  introduced  (e.g.  seeds).    As  the  import  permit  requires  the  applicant to provide both the common and scientific names of the plant being introduced, it

is  expected  that  the  CFIA  is  aware  that  ANI  as  well  as  AI  taxa  that  are  prohibited  from  importation  into  Canada  are  being  introduced  into  Ontario.    This  approach  contradicts  their mandate in addressing AI and ANI taxa.  Moreover, failure to prevent the importation  of AI and ANI taxa continues to put Ontario's natural environment at risk.    ANI  and  AI  taxa  are  expected  to  be  subjected  to  risk  assessments  prior  to  introduction.   These  assessments  have  been  discussed  in  the  literature  as  a  means  of  preventing  the  introduction of potential invaders.  Unfortunately, risk assessments are not conducted on a  regular basis by the CFIA and so far, only a limited number have been conducted (C. Wilson  O'Driscoll,  pers.  comm.  2011).    No  risk  assessments  for  ANI  taxa  introduced  through  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  have  been  conducted.    In  view  of  the  findings  that these species have the potential to become invaders, not doing risk assessments for all  taxa being introduced is a serious oversight by the government and an indictment on the  legislative  framework  in  Canada.    Once  again,  this  practice  operates  contrary  to  the  government's desire to address the issue of the aquarium and ornamental pond industries  as a pathway for potential invaders.  The three risk assessments conducted recommended  that  Cabomba, and yellow floating heart be added to the list of aquatic species prohibited  from  Canada.    Water  chestnut  is  already  on  the  list.    The  other  aquatic  plants  prohibited  from  Canada  are:  Brazilian  waterweed,  Hydrilla,  Myriophyllum  spp.,  and  Trapa  spp  (Appendix 5).  It is important to note that all of the aforementioned species are still being  sold by aquarium and ornamental pond stores even though they are prohibited from being  imported into Canada.  In view of this information, no steps have been taken to prevent the  introduction of AI and ANI into the natural environment.

5.0  RECOMMENDATIONS 
Given  the  failures  observed  within  the  legislative  framework  with  regards  to  the  importation  of  plants,  the  government  of  Canada  has  to  take  a  more  aggressive  stance  in  enforcing regulations surrounding the aquarium and ornamental pond industries.  This is  especially so as the majority of the aquatic plants used in aquariums and ornamental ponds  are  imported.    Funnell  et  al.  (2009,  p.  111)  noted,  "there  is  a  suite  of  federal  legislation  managing invasive species and few control the importation and sale of potentially harmful  species  related  to  the  aquarium  and  water  garden  industry."    In  addition,  "aquatic  plants  have  fallen  through  the  cracks  at  both  the  federal  and  provincial  level."    There  are  also  several complexities surrounding the aquarium and ornamental pond industries in Ontario.   Not only do these industries have the potential to contribute to Ontario's economic sector,  they  also  have  the  potential  to  impact  its  waterways.    Nevertheless,  there  are  three  approaches that can be taken with regards to plant importation: allow all and any species,  prohibit the introduction of new species, or screen species for the likelihood of becoming  invasive and only allowing species that are ranked low risk.  The first approach, based on  the  data  collected  in  this  research,  is  currently  in  place  but  does  little  to  prevent  the  introduction of either AI taxa or ANI taxa.  Second, banning the introduction of new species  would not be feasible as it may restrict the trade unnecessarily.      The third approach, seems the most appropriate, but would include a modification of the  present risk assessment used by the CFIA.  The present risk assessment involves ranking  species in terms of likelihood of introduction, establishment and natural spread potential,  and potential economic and environmental impacts.  The overall risk of the species is then  computated and recommendations are put forward.  This assessment is not comprehensive  as it does not include screening the plants based on the biological attributes of the plants to  be imported.  Biological attributes as an ideal predictor of successful potential invaders was  indicated  by  the  BLRM.    Key  biological  attributes  that  should  be  taken into  consideration  during the risk assessment are type of propagation strategies used, number of propagation  strategies  used,  number  of  dispersal  mechanisms  employed  per  plant,  growth  rate,  and  minimum temperature.   
96 

 

A  model  that  can  be  modified  and  used  in  Canada  is  the  weed  risk  assessment  (WRA)  model that is used in Australia and New Zealand that screens species based on their weed  status,  climate  and  environmental  preferences  and  biological  attributes  prior  to  introduction (Pheloung et al., 1999).  In this model 49 questions are answered that relate to  the  attributes  and  impacts  of  weeds  (Appendix  13).    The  questions  relate  to  the  history/biogeography  (e.g.  distribution,  climate  preferences,  invasive  potential),  and  biology/ecology  (e.g.  undesirable  traits,  plant  type,  reproduction,  dispersal  mechanisms  and persistence attributes) of the species being introduced.  Species can either be assigned  a score of 0, 1, or 2 in response to a question.  The decision to reject, evaluate further, or  accept  a  species  for  introduction  is  recommended  based  on  a  plant  achieving  a  critical  score between 0 and 6 (Pheloung et al., 1999).      In  light  of  the  traits  of  a  successful  invader  identified  by  the  BLRM,  the  WRA  could  be  modified  to  make  it  suitable  for  Canada.    The  question  "reproduction  by  vegetative  propagation"  (category:  reproduction),  should  be  changed  to  "reproduction  by  vegetative  propagation  using  vegetative  propagules",  in  order  to  account  for  the  presence  of  below  ground biomass, which is an attribute of a successful invader.  The question "species suited  to  Australian  climate"  (category:  climate  and  distribution)  and  "effective  natural  enemies  present in Australia" (category: persistence attributes) should also be changed to "species  suited  to  Canadian  climate"  and  "effective  natural  enemies  present  in  Canada"  to  suit  the  geographic region.  The other attributes that discriminate between ANI and AI taxa, namely  number  of  propagation  strategies  used,  number  of  dispersal  mechanisms  used,  and  minimum temperature are addressed in some way by the modified WRA (Appendix 13).             Daehler and Denslow (2007) also suggested that a modified WRA could be used in Canada  but its use is dependent on the government's objective with regards to plant introductions.   If  the  objective  is  to  assess  all  proposed  plant  introductions,  then  a  modified  WRA  is  the  most feasible since this model has been used successfully in other temperate regions, and  can  accurately  identify  more  than  90%  major  pests  and  7090%  nonpests  (Daehler  and  Denslow, 2007).  If, however, the converse is true, then the present system (USDAAPHIS)  should remain, as it allows for consideration of unique information or circumstances rather 
97 

 

than  being  restricted  to  specific  questions  (Daehler  and  Denslow,  2007).    While  the  modified WRA appears better than the BLRM in terms of accurately predicting ANI and AI  taxa, there is no perfect model.  There are similarities between the biological traits used in  the modified WRA as well as those identified to best discriminate between ANI and AI taxa  using the BLRM.  The differences between the two are how the attributes are used, and the  assigning of scores to determine introduction.  For example, in the modified WRA, dispersal  mechanisms are named while in the BLRM they are grouped.      In  light  of  the  information  presented,  the  government  of  Canada  has  several  options  to  consider  in  terms  of  risk  management.    Since  the  present  system  does  not  appear  to  be  working  as  AI  and  ANI  taxa  are  still  being  introduced  into  Canada,  as  shown  by  this  research, then it is recommended that a modified WRA be developed and implemented to  screen all plant imports.  The only taxa to be allowed entry would be those regarded as low  risk to the environment.  The WRA model could be used for a defined period of time and  comparisons  made  between  the  two  models  in  terms  of  accurate  identification  of  AI  and  ANI taxa.  Given that the sale of AI and ANI taxa is a thriving business, the screened WRA  would  have  to  be  applied  over  a  phased  basis  in  order  to  give  owners  of  aquariums  and  ornamental  pond  stores  time  to  identify  alternative  plants  that  can  be  sold  to  their  customers.    The  WRA  could  be  first  done  to  eliminate  the  AI  taxa  from  the  industry  and  then the ANI taxa could be targeted.  The government in turn could also provide aquarium  and ornamental pond owners with a list of acceptable species for the trade.  One suggested  example is the  Grow  me  instead guide developed for Southern Ontario (OIPC, 2011).  This  document  also  contains  links  to  other  publications  and  websites  that  discuss  native  alternatives for AI taxa.  Caution should be taken, however, in using the OIPC document, as  some of the alternatives recommended are AI taxa in Ontario and other parts of the world,  for  example,  common  cattail  (Typha  latifolia),  hornwort,  common  mare's  tail  (Hippuris  vulgaris), Brazilian waterweed, and fragrant water lily (Nymphaea odorata).    Another  strategy  that  could  be  undertaken  by  the  government  is  to  conduct  both  a  projected  cost  and  a  cost  benefit  analyses  of  the  AI  and  ANI  taxa  distributed  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  in  Ontario  and  on  the  wider  scale,  Canada.  
98 

 

These  analyses  would  consider  both  environmental  and  economic  factors  and  are  important  considering  that  there  is  limited,  if  any,  statistics  about  these  industries  in  Ontario.    The  large  sums  of  monies  expended  to  date  to  mitigate  and  control  AI  taxa  in  Ontario,  and  Canada  overall,  could  be  used  to  project  the  likely  economic  costs  for  addressing AI taxa presently being sold, if they became established.  In the case of the ANI  taxa, the analysis would have to determine the costs and benefits of having these taxa in the  trade  and the  likely  impact  of  their  removal.    Additionally,  the  analysis  should  determine  the costs associated with their likelihood of spread, since the ANI taxa being sold have the  potential  to  become  invaders.    Considerations  would  also  have  to  be  given  to  the  direct  costs for implementing the modified WRA.            Partnerships  should  also  be  fostered  with  importers  and  retailers  of  aquatic  plants  to  discuss  the  proposed  implementation  of  the  modified  WRA  and  to  get  their  input.   Stakeholders already involved in the process such as the Canadian Association of Aquarium  Clubs (CAOAC), the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC), OFAH, and Ontario Streams  should also be included in the discussions.  These partnerships also have the potential to  identify why AI and ANI taxa are preferred over native species.  Obtaining this information  gives  the  government  other  avenues  that  need  to  be  addressed  in  the  aquarium  and  ornamental pond industries that were not previously recognised.     Along  with  the  recommended  changes  in  the  legislative  framework,  another  option  that  could be considered is the implementation of a behavioural change campaign (BCC).  A BCC  or as it is more widely known, communitybased social marketing, is used to affect change  in  behaviour  when  an  information  campaign  has  not  achieved  the  desired  results.    The  MNR/OFAH  has  implemented  a  public  education  and  awareness  campaign,  that  reaches  over a million persons each year and raises public awareness of invading species through  public  participation,  demonstrations,  and  educational  campaigns  (e.g.  brochures,  posters,  wallet cards) (Funnell  et  al., 2009); however, despite the large target audience reached by  the programme, AI and ANI taxa are still being used and have the potential to be released  into the natural environment.   

99 

 

Communitybased social marketing uses a pragmatic approach in order to affect behaviour  change.    The  approach  includes:  identifying  the  barriers  to  sustainable  behaviour,  designing  a  strategy  that  uses  behaviour  change  tools,  piloting  the  strategy  in  the  community,  and  evaluating  the  impact  of  the  programme  following  implementation  (McKenzieMohr,  1999).    For  the  GTA,  the  target  audience  would  have  to  be  the  persons  importing,  buying  and  using  AI  and  ANI  taxa  for  aquariums  and  ornamental  ponds.   Children  would  not  be  the  main  focus  group  of  the  campaign  but  they  would  not  be  excluded.    Identification  of  the  barriers  (internal  and  external)  would  require  the  use  of  focus groups, community meetings, review of literature and survey research.  Knowledge of  the barriers indicates the areas to be addressed by the campaign; for example, why are AI  and ANI taxa widely used in aquarium and ornamental ponds?  This information could be  gathered  by  conducting  a  detailed  assessment  that  would  inform  the  BCC.    Changes  in  behaviour  would  be  achieved  through  oral  or  written  commitment  as  a  means  of  getting  people  to  agree  to  make  changes.    This  commitment  could  be  obtained  from  a  selected  community  that  will  act  as  the  pilot  before  the  campaign  is  taken  on  a  widerscale.   Moreover,  use  of  a  smaller  group  allows  the  desired  approach  to  be  tested  and  modified  accordingly.    Once  the  aforementioned  steps  are  done,  then  the  pilot  would  have  to  be  evaluated.  The SMART6 approach could be used.                   For children (though applicable to adults), the campaign could target the smaller kids since  they are the future generation.  From personal observations, when kids know the dos and  don'ts  in  relation  to  the  environment,  they  can  change  their  parent's  way  of  thinking.    In  order  to  reinforce  that  IAS  and  other  potential  invaders  are  detrimental  to  the  environment, firsthandexperiences may be useful; for example, field trips to affected sites  via boats or buses, and cleanup programmes of affected areas.  Live exhibits could also be  constructed about invasive aquatic species (plants and animals) and placed in areas of easy  access, for example, museums.

In terms of the methodology used in this research, as previously discussed, the BLRM did a  good job of classifying ANI as ANI than AI as AI.  However, the model misclassified AI and  ANI  taxa,  which  has  management  implications,  especially  in  the  introduction  of  aquatic  plants.  In order to address this limitation, further studies could be conducted that examine  closely the attributes of aquatic plant invaders.  This could be achieved by increasing the  number  of  attributes  or  identifying  other  attributes  that  can  be  examined  to  determine  what  other  traits  contribute  to  the  success  of  invaders.    In  addition,  a  better  predictive  model  that  can  clearly  distinguishes  between  ANI  and  AI  taxa  could  be  developed,  which  would prevent the introduction of high risk species.  The other predictive model used in the  research,  the  LRM,  indicated  that  morphological  strategies  were  not  significant  in  determining  the  likelihood  of  success  aquatic  plant  invaders.    Therefore,  future  research  should  be  conducted  in  order  to  determine  if  morphological  strategies  contribute  to  the  success  of  potential  invaders,  that  is,  do  they  operate  alone  or  in  conjunction  with  other  factors.     Finally,  based  on  the  findings  in  this  research,  the  following  are  important  areas  that  the  government needs to address:             
101 

The aquarium and ornamental pond industries as a source for AI and ANI taxa;  The  legislation  that  regulates  the  introduction  or  importation  of  taxa  should  be  enforced;  Risk  assessments  should  be  conducted  for  ALL  taxa  being  introduced  in  order  to  allow only the introduction of low risk species;  Native species should be included within the widely sold aquarium and ornamental  pond industries;  A behaviour change campaign should be instituted; and  A projected cost and cost benefit analyses for the AI and ANI taxa distributed by the  aquarium and ornamental pond industries. 

 

6.0  CONCLUSION 
  The purpose and objectives of this research were to determine if there are common traits  of  a  successful  aquatic  invader.    There  were  five  research  questions,  three  related  to  the  strategies  employed  by  aquatic  plants  and  two  on  the  role  played  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental pond industries in the introduction of aquatic plant invaders.    

6.1  Answer to research questions context  
Do  the  morphological  strategies  of  aquatic  plants  sold  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental pond industries relate to the likelihood of success as invaders?    Two  morphological  strategies,  life  cycle  and  growth  form,  were  investigated  during  the  research.  Life cycle examined whether aquatic plants were annuals or perennials, whereas  growth  form  determined  if  the  plants  were  submerged,  floating,  or  emergent.    Unlike  several  authors  that  indicated  that  life  cycle  and  growth  form  were  important  traits  of  successful  invaders,  the  predictive  models  revealed  that  these  morphological  strategies  were not significant in determining the likelihood of success of aquatic plants as invaders.        Do  the  reproductive  strategies  of  aquatic  plants  sold  by  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond industries relate to the likelihood of success as invaders?    Nine reproductive strategies were investigated during the research.  These strategies were  number  of  reproductive  strategies  used,  type  of  propagation  strategies  used,  number  of  propagation strategies used, number of dispersal mechanisms employed by plant, type of  dispersal mechanism used, number of vegetative propagules produced per biomass, type of  vegetative propagules used, breeding system, and number of seeds or spores produced per  biomass.  Of the nine, three were considered significant in determining the success of likely  aquatic  invaders,  especially  between  ANI  and  AI  taxa.    These  were  type  of  propagation  strategies  used,  number  of  propagation  strategies  used  and  number  of  dispersal 

102 

 

mechanisms employed by plant.  In light of these results, reproductive strategies do relate  to the likelihood of success of aquatic invaders.      Do the physiological strategies of aquatic plants sold by the aquarium and ornamental  pond industries relate to the likelihood of success as invaders?    Fourteen physiological strategies were investigated during the research.  These strategies  were  temperature,  salinity,  pH,  nutrient  content,  light  suitability,  growth  rate,  number  of  phenotypic forms produced, stem length, stem width, leaf length, leaf width, flower length,  flower  width,  fruit  length,  fruit  width,  fruit  type,  seed  size,  and  time  to  flower.    Of  these,  one,  minimum  temperature,  was  considered  significantly  important  in  determining  the  success  of  likely  aquatic  invaders,  especially  between  ANI  and  AI  taxa.    In  view  of  this  result, physiological strategy do relate to the likelihood of success of aquatic invaders.      Do  the  aquarium  and  ornamental  pond  industries  have  the  potential  to  contribute  to  the  success  and/or  failure  of  aquatic  plant  invaders  based  on  the  presence  of  aquatic  plants with specific traits in the trade that increases their chances for introduction and  invasion?    Aquarium and ornamental pond stores in the GTA mainly sold ANI and AI taxa.  Majority of  ANI  and  AI  taxa  were  found  to  possess  similar  biological  traits,  with  the  exception  of  minimum growth temperature.  However, since AI and ANI taxa are able to withstand low  temperatures,  these  taxa  are  able  to  survive  Ontario's  climate  and  have  the  potential  to  become  invasive.    Volume  of  sales  of  aquatic  plants  was  also  found  to  be  significant  as  a  proxy  of  opportunity  for  introduction  of  ANI  and  AI  taxa.    AI  taxa  had  the  highest  sales  volume  with  the  greatest  potential  of  release  in  comparison  to  ANI  taxa,  which  had  the  lesser potential for being released.  In light of the aforementioned findings, the aquarium  and ornamental pond industries does contribute to the success of aquatic plant invaders by  distributing aquatic plants with specific traits that increases their chances for introduction  and invasion.   

103 

 

If  these  industries  do  contribute  to  the  success  of  aquatic  plant  invaders,  what  is  the  legislative framework within Ontario that governs the introduction of these plants and  how  can  it  be  amended  or  enforced  to  sufficiently  address  the  problems  posed  by  the  industries?    Aquatic plants and plants in general, are introduced into Canada under the Plant Protection  Act (1990).  There is however, a perceived breakdown of the legislative framework as ANI  and  AI  taxa  continue  to  be  imported  into  Canada.    One  recommendation  to  address  this  problem is to apply a modified WRA to all plants being introduced into Canada.  Applying  this  type  of  risk  assessment  would  only  allow  species  considered  of  low  risk  to  the  environment  to  be  imported.    Native  species  should  also  be  encouraged  for  use  in  aquariums and ornamental ponds.  Partnerships between the government, importers and  retailers  and  other  nongovernmental  organizations  involved  in  the  aquarium  and  ornamental pond industries should also be created and/or maintained.  Such a partnership  would  ensure  that  these  organizations  have  an  input  in  any  decisions  made  by  the  government.  Finally, a behaviour change campaign should be implemented, which focuses  on achieving sustainable behaviour amongst persons who own aquariums and ornamental  ponds.

Appendix 2:  Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests (FAO, 2006)    1.  Stage 1: Initiation  The  aim  of  the  initiation  stage  is  to  identify  the  pest(s)  and  pathways  which  are  of  quarantine concern and should be considered for risk analysis in relation to the identified  PRA area.    S2  Some LMOs may present a phytosanitary risk and therefore warrant a PRA. However other  LMOs  will  not  present  phytosanitary  risks  beyond  those  posed  by  related  nonLMOs  and  therefore will not warrant a complete PRA. Thus, for LMOs, the aim of the Initiation stage is  to  identify  those  LMOs  that  have  the  characteristics  of  a  potential  pest  and  need  to  be  assessed further, and those which need no further assessment under ISPM No. 11.    S2  LMOs are organisms that have been modified using techniques of modern biotechnology to  express  one  or  more  new  or  altered  traits.  In  most  cases,  the  parent  organism  is  not  normally  considered  to  be  a  plant  pest  but  an  assessment  may  need  to  be  performed  to  determine  if  the  genetic  modification  (i.e.  gene,  new  gene  sequence  that  regulates  other  genes, or gene product) results in a new trait or characteristic that may present a plant pest  risk.    S2  A plant pest risk from LMOs may be presented by:   the organism(s) with the inserted gene(s) (i.e. the LMO)   the combination of genetic material (e.g. gene from plant pests such as viruses) or   the consequences of the genetic material moving to another organism.    1.1  Initiation points  The PRA process may be initiated as a result of:   the identification of a pathway that presents a potential pest hazard   the identification of a pest that may require phytosanitary measures   the review or revision of phytosanitary policies and priorities.    S1  The  initiation  points  frequently  refer  to  "pests".  The  IPPC  defines  a  pest  as  "any  species,  strain  or  biotype  of  plant,  animal,  or  pathogenic  agent,  injurious  to  plants  or  plant  products."  In  applying  these  initiation  points  to  the  specific  case  of  plants  as  pests,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  plants  concerned  should  satisfy  this  definition.  Pests  directly  affecting  plants  satisfy  this  definition.  In  addition,  many  organisms  indirectly  affecting  plants  also  satisfy  this  definition  (such  as  weeds/invasive  plants).  The  fact  that  they  are  injurious to plants can be based on evidence obtained in an area where they occur. In the  case of organisms where there is insufficient evidence that they affect plants indirectly, it  may nevertheless be appropriate to assess on the basis of available pertinent information,  whether  they  are  potentially  injurious  in  the  PRA  area  by  using  a  clearly  documented,  consistently  applied  and  transparent  system.  This  is  particularly  important  for  plant  species or cultivars that are imported for planting.   
109 

 

S2  The types of LMOs that an NPPO may be asked to assess for phytosanitary risk include:   plants  for  use  (a)  as  agricultural  crops,  for  food  and  feed,  ornamental  plants  or  managed forests; (b) in bioremediation (as an organism that cleans up contamination);  (c)  for  industrial  purposes  (e.g.  production  of  enzymes  or  bioplastics);  (d)  as  therapeutic agents (e.g. pharmaceutical production)   biological control agents modified to improve their performance in that role   pests modified to alter their pathogenic characteristic and thereby make them useful  for  biological  control  (see  ISPM  No.  3:  Code  of  conduct  for  the  import  and  release  of  exotic biological control agents)   organisms genetically modified to improve their characteristics such as for biofertilizer  or other influences on soil, bioremediation or industrial uses.    S2  In order to be categorized as a pest, an LMO has to be injurious or potentially injurious to  plants or plant products under conditions in the PRA area. This damage may be in the form  of direct effects on plants or plant products, or indirect effects. For guidance on the process  of  determining  whether  an  LMO  has  the  potential  to  be  a  pest,  refer  to  Annex  3,  Determining the potential for a living modified organism to be a pest.    1.1.1  PRA initiated by the identification of a pathway  The  need  for  a  new  or  revised  PRA  of  a  specific  pathway  may  arise  in  the  following  situations:   international  trade  is  initiated  in  a  commodity  not  previously  imported  into  the  country  (usually  a  plant  or  plant  product,  including  genetically  altered  plants)  or  a  commodity from a new area or new country of origin   new plant species are imported for selection and scientific research purposes   a  pathway  other  than  commodity  import  is  identified  (natural  spread,  packing  material, mail, garbage, passenger baggage, etc.).    A list of pests likely to be associated with the pathway (e.g. carried by the commodity) may  be  generated  by  any  combination  of  official  sources,  databases,  scientific  and  other  literature, or expert consultation. It is preferable to prioritize the listing, based on expert  judgement  on  pest  distribution  and  types  of  pests.  If  no  potential  quarantine  pests  are  identified as likely to follow the pathway, the PRA may stop at this point.    S2  The phrase "genetically altered plants" is understood to mean plants obtained through the  use of modern biotechnology.    1.1.2  PRA initiated by the identification of a pest  A  requirement  for  a  new  or  revised  PRA  on  a  specific  pest  may  arise  in  the  following  situations:   an emergency arises on discovery of an established infestation or an outbreak of a new  pest within a PRA area   an emergency arises on interception of a new pest on an imported commodity   a new pest risk is identified by scientific research   a pest is introduced into an area

  S2  The  phrase  "genetically  altered"  is  understood  to  include  obtained  through  the  use  of  modern biotechnology.    1.1.3  PRA initiated by the review or revision of a policy  A  requirement  for  a  new  or  revised  PRA  originating  from  policy  concerns  will  most  frequently arise in the following situations:   a  national  decision  is  taken  to  review  phytosanitary  regulations,  requirements  or  operations   a proposal made by another country or by an international organization (RPPO, FAO)  is reviewed   a  new  treatment  or  loss  of  a  treatment  system,  a  new  process,  or  new  information  impacts on an earlier decision   a dispute arises on phytosanitary measures   the phytosanitary situation in a country changes, a new country is created, or political  boundaries have changed.    1.2  Identification of PRA area  The  PRA  area  should  be  defined  as  precisely  as  possible  in  order  to  identify  the  area  for  which information is needed.    1.3  Information  Information  gathering  is  an  essential  element  of  all  stages  of  PRA.  It  is  important  at  the  initiation stage in order to clarify the identity of the pest(s), its/their present distribution  and association with host plants, commodities, etc. Other information will be gathered as  required to reach necessary decisions as the PRA continues.  Information  for  PRA  may  come  from  a  variety  of  sources.  The  provision  of  official  information  regarding pest  status  is  an  obligation  under the  IPPC  (Art.  VIII.1c)  facilitated  by official contact points (Art. VIII.2).    S1  For environmental risks, the variety of sources of information will generally be wider than  traditionally used by NPPOs. Broader inputs may be required. These sources may include  environmental  impact  assessments,  but  it  should  be  recognized  that  such  assessments  usually do not have the same purpose as PRA and cannot substitute for PRA.    S2  For LMOs, information required for a full risk analysis may include:   name,  identity  and  taxonomic  status  of  the  LMO  (including  any  relevant  identifying  codes) and the risk management measures applied to the LMO in the country of export   taxonomic status, common name, point of collection or acquisition, and characteristics

  S2  Information  regarding  pest  status  is  an  obligation  under  the  IPPC  (Article  VIII.1c)  facilitated  by  official  contact  points  (Article  VIII.2).  A  country  may  have  obligations  to  provide  information  about  LMOs  under  other  international  agreements  such  as  the  Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2000; Cartagena  Protocol). The Cartagena Protocol has a Biosafety Clearinghouse that may contain relevant  information.  Information  on  LMOs  is  sometimes  commercially  sensitive  and  applicable  obligations with regard to release and handling of information should be observed.    1.3.1  Previous PRA  A check should also be made as to whether pathways, pests or policies have already been  subjected to the PRA process, either nationally or internationally. If a PRA exists, its validity  should be checked as circumstances and information may have changed. The possibility of  using a PRA from a similar pathway or pest, that may partly or entirely replace the need for  a new PRA, should also be investigated.    1.4  Conclusion of initiation  At the end of Stage 1, the initiation point, the pests and pathways of concern and the PRA  area will have been identified. Relevant information has been collected and pests have been  identified  as  possible  candidates  for  phytosanitary  measures,  either  individually  or  in  association with a pathway.    S2  For LMOs at the end of Stage 1 an NPPO may decide that the LMO:   is a potential pest and needs to be assessed further in Stage 2 or   is not a potential pest and needs no further analysis under ISPM No. 11 (but see also  the following paragraph).    S2  PRA under the IPPC only relates to the assessment and management of phytosanitary risks.  As with other organisms or pathways assessed by an NPPO, LMOs may present other risks  not  falling  within  the  scope  covered  by  the  IPPC.  For  LMOs,  PRA  may  constitute  only  a  portion  of  the  required  overall  risk  analysis.  For  example,  countries  may  require  the  assessment of risks to human or animal health or to the environment beyond that covered  by the IPPC. When an NPPO discovers potential for risks that are not phytosanitary it may  be appropriate to notify the relevant authorities.    2.  Stage 2: Pest Risk Assessment  The process for pest risk assessment can be broadly divided into three interrelated steps: 
112 

 

 pest categorization   assessment of the probability of introduction and spread   assessment of potential economic consequences (including environmental impacts).    In  most  cases,  these  steps  will  be  applied  sequentially  in  a  PRA  but  it  is  not  essential  to  follow  a  particular  sequence.  Pest  risk  assessment  needs  to  be  only  as  complex  as  is  technically justified by the circumstances. This standard allows a specific PRA to be judged  against  the  principles  of  necessity,  minimal  impact,  transparency,  equivalence,  risk  analysis,  managed  risk  and  nondiscrimination  set  out  in  ISPM  No.  1:  Principles  of  plant  quarantine as related to international trade (FAO, 1995).    S2  For LMOs, from this point forward in PRA, it is assumed that the LMO is being assessed as a  pest and therefore "LMO" refers to an LMO that is a potential quarantine pest due to new or  altered  characteristics  or  properties  resulting  from  the  genetic  modification.  The  risk  assessment  should  be  carried  out  on  a  casebycase  basis.  LMOs  that  have  pest  characteristics unrelated to the genetic modification should be assessed using the normal  procedures.    2.1  Pest categorization  At  the  outset,  it  may  not  be  clear  which  pest(s)  identified  in  Stage  1  require  a  PRA.  The  categorization  process  examines  for  each  pest  whether  the  criteria  in  the  definition  for  a  quarantine pest are satisfied.    In the evaluation of a pathway associated with a commodity, a number of individual PRAs  may  be  necessary  for  the  various  pests  potentially  associated  with  the  pathway.  The  opportunity  to  eliminate  an  organism  or  organisms  from  consideration  before  indepth  examination is undertaken is a valuable characteristic of the categorization process.    An advantage of pest categorization is that it can be done with relatively little information,  however information should be sufficient to adequately carry out the categorization.    2.1.1  Elements of categorization  The categorization of a pest as a quarantine pest includes the following primary elements:   identity of the pest   presence or absence in the PRA area   regulatory status   potential for establishment and spread in PRA area   potential  for  economic  consequences  (including  environmental  consequences)  in  the  PRA area.    2.1.1.1  Identity of pest  The  identity  of  the  pest  should  be  clearly  defined  to  ensure  that  the  assessment  is  being  performed  on  a  distinct  organism,  and  that  biological  and  other  information  used  in  the  assessment is relevant to the organism in question. If this is not possible because the causal 

113 

 

agent  of  particular  symptoms  has  not  yet  been  fully  identified,  then  it  should  have  been  shown to produce consistent symptoms and to be transmissible.    The taxonomic unit for the pest is generally species. The use of a higher or lower taxonomic  level should be supported by scientifically sound rationale. In the case of levels below the  species,  this  should  include  evidence  demonstrating  that  factors  such  as  differences  in  virulence, host range or vector relationships are significant enough to affect phytosanitary  status.    In cases where a vector is involved, the vector may also be considered a pest to the extent  that it is associated with the causal organism and is required for transmission of the pest.    S2  In  the  case  of  LMOs,  identification  requires  information  regarding  characteristics  of  the  recipient  or  parent  organism,  the  donor  organism,  the  genetic  construct,  the  gene  or  transgene vector and the nature of the genetic modification. Information requirements are  set out under section 1.3.    2.1.1.2  Presence or absence in PRA area  The pest should be absent from all or a defined part of the PRA area.    S2  In the case of LMOs, this should relate to the LMO of phytosanitary concern.    2.1.1.3  Regulatory status  If the pest is present but not widely distributed in the PRA area, it should be under official  control or expected to be under official control in the near future.    S1  Official control of pests presenting an environmental risk may involve agencies other than  the  NPPO.  However,  it  is  recognized  that  ISPM  No.  5  Glossary  of  phytosanitary  terms,  Supplement No. 1 on official control, in particular Section 5.7, applies.    S2  In  the  case  of  LMOs,  official  control  should  relate  to  the  phytosanitary  measures  applied  because of the pest nature of the LMO. It may be appropriate to consider any official control  measures  in  place  for  the  parent  organism,  donor  organism,  transgene  vector  or  gene  vector.    2.1.1.4  Potential for establishment and spread in PRA area  Evidence  should  be  available  to  support  the  conclusion  that  the  pest  could  become  established  or  spread  in  the  PRA  area.  The  PRA  area  should  have  ecological/climatic  conditions  including  those  in  protected  conditions  suitable  for  the  establishment  and  spread of the pest and where relevant, host species (or near relatives), alternate hosts and  vectors should be present in the PRA area.    S2  For LMOs, the following should also be considered:   changes  in  adaptive  characteristics  resulting  from  the  genetic  modification  that  may  increase the potential for establishment and spread 
114 

 

  S2  For more detailed guidance on the assessment of these characteristics, see Annex 3.    2.1.1.5  Potential for economic consequences in PRA area  There should be clear indications that the pest is likely to have an unacceptable economic  impact (including environmental impact) in the PRA area.    S1  Unacceptable economic impact is described in ISPM No. 5, Glossary of phytosanitary terms,  Supplement No. 2: Guidelines on the understanding of potential economic importance and  related terms.    S2  In the case of LMOs, the economic impact (including environmental impact) should relate  to the pest nature (injurious to plants and plant products) of the LMO.    2.1.2  Conclusion of pest categorization  If it has been determined that the pest has the potential to be a quarantine pest, the PRA  process should continue. If a pest does not fulfil all of the criteria for a quarantine pest, the  PRA  process  for  that  pest  may  stop.  In  the  absence  of  sufficient  information,  the  uncertainties should be identified and the PRA process should continue.    2.2  Assessment of the probability of introduction and spread  Pest introduction is comprised of both entry and establishment. Assessing the probability  of  introduction  requires  an  analysis  of  each  of  the  pathways  with  which  a  pest  may  be  associated  from  its  origin  to  its  establishment  in  the  PRA  area.  In  a  PRA  initiated  by  a  specific  pathway  (usually  an  imported  commodity),  the  probability  of  pest  entry  is  evaluated  for  the  pathway  in  question.  The  probabilities  for  pest  entry  associated  with  other pathways need to be investigated as well.    For risk analyses that have been initiated for a specific pest, with no particular commodity  or  pathway  under  consideration,  the  potential  of  all  probable  pathways  should  be  considered.    The  assessment  of  probability  of  spread  is  based  primarily  on  biological  considerations  similar to those for entry and establishment.    S1  With respect to a plant being assessed as a pest with indirect effects, wherever a reference  is made to a host or a host range, this should be understood to refer instead to a suitable  habitat7 (that is a place where the plant can grow) in the PRA area.

115 

 

S1  The  intended  habitat  is  the  place  where  the  plants  are  intended  to  grow  and  the  unintended habitat is the place where the plants are not intended to grow.    S1  In the case of plants to be imported, the concepts of entry, establishment and spread have  to be considered differently.    S1  Plants  for  planting  that  are  imported  will  enter  and  then  be  maintained  in  an  intended  habitat,  probably  in  substantial  numbers  and  for  an  indeterminate  period.  Accordingly,  Section  2.2.1  on  Entry  does  not  apply.  The  risk  arises  because  of  the  probability  that  the  plant  may  spread  from  the  intended  habitat  to  unintended  habitats  within  the  PRA  area,  and  then  establish  in  those  habitats.  Accordingly,  section  2.2.3  may  be  considered  before  section 2.2.2. Unintended habitats may occur in the vicinity of the intended habitat in the  PRA area.    S1  Imported plants not intended to be planted may be used for different purposes (e.g. used as  bird seed, as fodder, or for processing). The risk arises because of the probability that the  plant  may  escape  or  be  diverted  from  the  intended  use  to  an  unintended  habitat  and  establish there.    S2  Assessing the probability of introduction of an LMO requires an analysis of both intentional  or unintentional pathways of introduction, and intended use.    2.2.1  Probability of entry of a pest  The probability of entry of a pest depends on the pathways from the exporting country to  the destination, and the frequency and quantity of pests associated with them. The higher  the number of pathways, the greater the probability of the pest entering the PRA area.    Documented pathways for the pest to enter new areas should be noted. Potential pathways,  which  may  not  currently  exist,  should  be  assessed.  Pest  interception  data  may  provide  evidence of the ability of a pest to be associated with a pathway and to survive in transport  or storage.    S1  In the case of plants to be imported, the plants will enter and an assessment of probability  of entry will not be required. Therefore this section does not apply. However, this section  does  apply  to  pests  that  may  be  carried  by  such  plants  (e.g.  weed  seeds  with  seeds  imported for planting).    S2  This section is not relevant to LMOs imported for intentional release into the environment.    2.2.1.1  Identification of pathways for a PRA initiated by a pest  All relevant pathways should be considered. They can be identified principally in relation  to  the  geographical  distribution  and  host  range  of  the  pest.  Consignments  of  plants  and  plant  products  moving  in  international  trade  are  the  principal  pathways  of  concern  and  existing patterns of such trade will, to a substantial extent, determine which pathways are  relevant. Other pathways such as other types of commodities, packing materials, persons,  baggage,  mail,  conveyances  and  the  exchange  of  scientific  material  should  be  considered 
116 

 

where  appropriate.  Entry  by  natural  means  should  also  be  assessed,  as  natural  spread  is  likely to reduce the effectiveness of phytosanitary measures.    S2  For  LMOs,  all  relevant  pathways  of  introduction  should  be  considered  (intentional  and  unintentional).    2.2.1.2  Probability of the pest being associated with the pathway at origin  The  probability  of  the pest  being associated, spatially  or  temporally,  with  the  pathway  at  origin should be estimated. Factors to consider are:   prevalence of the pest in the source area   occurrence  of  the  pest  in  a  lifestage  that  would  be  associated  with  commodities,  containers, or conveyances   volume and frequency of movement along the pathway   seasonal timing   pest  management,  cultural  and  commercial  procedures  applied  at  the  place  of  origin  (application of plant protection products, handling, culling, roguing, grading).    2.2.1.3  Probability of survival during transport or storage  Examples of factors to consider are:   speed and conditions of transport and duration of the life cycle of the pest in relation  to time in transport and storage   vulnerability of the lifestages during transport or storage   prevalence of pest likely to be associated with a consignment   commercial procedures (e.g. refrigeration) applied to consignments in the country of  origin, country of destination, or in transport or storage.    2.2.1.4  Probability of pest surviving existing pest management procedures  Existing  pest  management  procedures  (including  phytosanitary  procedures)  applied  to  consignments  against  other  pests  from  origin  to  enduse,  should  be  evaluated  for  effectiveness against the pest in question. The probability that the pest will go undetected  during inspection or survive other existing phytosanitary procedures should be estimated.    2.2.1.5  Probability of transfer to a suitable host  Factors to consider are:   dispersal  mechanisms,  including  vectors  to  allow  movement  from  the  pathway  to  a  suitable host   whether the imported commodity is to be sent to a few or many destination points in  the PRA area   proximity of entry, transit and destination points to suitable hosts   time of year at which import takes place   intended use of the commodity (e.g. for planting, processing and consumption)   risks from byproducts and waste.   

117 

 

Some  uses  are  associated  with  a  much  higher  probability  of  introduction  (e.g. planting)  than  others  (e.g.  processing).  The  probability  associated  with  any  growth,  processing,  or  disposal of the commodity in the vicinity of suitable hosts should also be considered.    S2  For LMOs, the probability of gene flow and gene transfer should also be considered, when  there is a trait of phytosanitary concern that may be transferred.    2.2.2  Probability of establishment  In  order  to  estimate  the  probability  of  establishment  of  a  pest,  reliable  biological  information (life cycle, host range, epidemiology, survival etc.) should be obtained from the  areas where the pest currently occurs. The situation in the PRA area can then be compared  with  that  in  the  areas  where  it  currently  occurs  (taking  account  also  of  protected  environments  such  as  glass  or  greenhouses)  and  expert  judgement  used  to  assess  the  probability  of  establishment.  Case  histories  concerning  comparable  pests  can  be  considered. Examples of the factors to consider are:   availability, quantity and distribution of hosts in the PRA area   environmental suitability in the PRA area   potential for adaptation of the pest   reproductive strategy of the pest   method of pest survival   cultural practices and control measures.    In  considering  probability  of  establishment,  it  should  be  noted  that  a  transient  pest  (see  ISPM No. 8: Determination of pest status in an area) may not be able to establish in the PRA  area  (e.g.  because  of  unsuitable  climatic  conditions)  but  could  still  have  unacceptable  economic consequences (see IPPC Art. VII.3).    S1  In  the  case  of  plants  to  be  imported,  the  assessment  of  the  probability  of  establishment  concerns the unintended habitats.    S2  For LMOs, the survival capacity without human intervention should also be considered.    S2  In addition, where gene flow is a concern in the PRA area, the probability of expression and  establishment of a trait of phytosanitary concern should be considered.     S2  Case  histories  concerning  comparable  LMOs  or  other  organisms  carrying  the  same  construct can be considered.    2.2.2.1  Availability  of  suitable  hosts,  alternate  hosts  and  vectors  in  the  PRA  area  Factors to consider are:   whether hosts and alternate hosts are present and how abundant or widely distributed  they may be   whether  hosts  and  alternate  hosts  occur  within  sufficient  geographic  proximity  to  allow the pest to complete its life cycle 
118 

 

  The taxonomic level at which hosts are considered should normally be the "species". The  use of higher or lower taxonomic levels should be justified by scientifically sound rationale.    2.2.2.2  Suitability of environment  Factors in the environment (e.g. suitability of climate, soil, pest and host competition) that  are critical to the development of the pest, its host and if applicable its vector, and to their  ability  to  survive  periods  of  climatic  stress  and  complete  their  life  cycles,  should  be  identified. It should be noted that the environment is likely to have different effects on the  pest,  its  host  and  its  vector.  This  needs  to  be  recognized  in  determining  whether  the  interaction between these organisms in the area of origin is maintained in the PRA area to  the  benefit  or  detriment  of  the  pest.  The  probability  of  establishment  in  a  protected  environment, e.g. in glasshouses, should also be considered.    Climatic  modelling  systems  may  be  used  to  compare  climatic  data  on  the  known  distribution of a pest with that in the PRA area.    2.2.2.3  Cultural practices and control measures  Where applicable, practices employed during the cultivation/production of the host crops  should  be  compared  to  determine  if  there  are  differences  in  such  practices  between  the  PRA area and the origin of the pest that may influence its ability to establish.    S2  For plants that are LMOs, it may also be appropriate to consider specific cultural, control or  management practices.    Pest  control  programs  or  natural  enemies  already  in  the  PRA  area  which  reduce  the  probability  of  establishment  may  be  considered.  Pests  for  which  control  is  not  feasible  should  be  considered  to  present  a  greater  risk  than  those  for  which  treatment  is  easily  accomplished. The availability (or lack) of suitable methods for eradication should also be  considered.    2.2.2.4  Other  characteristics  of  the  pest  affecting  the  probability  of  establishment  These include:   Reproductive  strategy  of  the  pests  and  method  of  pest  survival   Characteristics, which  enable  the  pest  to  reproduce  effectively  in  the  new  environment,  such  as  parthenogenesis/selfcrossing,  duration  of  the  life  cycle,  number  of  generations  per  year, resting stage etc., should be identified.   Genetic  adaptability   Whether the species is polymorphic and the degree to which the  pest  has  demonstrated  the  ability  to  adapt  to  conditions  like  those  in  the  PRA  area 
119 

 whether  there  are  other  plant  species,  which  could  prove  to  be  suitable  hosts  in  the  absence of the usual host species   whether a vector, if needed for dispersal of the pest, is already present in the PRA area  or likely to be introduced   whether another vector species occurs in the PRA area. 

 

should  be  considered,  e.g.,  hostspecific  races  or  races  adapted  to  a  wider  range  of  habitats or to new hosts. This genotypic (and phenotypic) variability facilitates a pest's  ability to withstand environmental fluctuations, to adapt to a wider range of habitats,  to develop pesticide resistance and to overcome host resistance.   Minimum  population  needed  for  establishment    If  possible,  the  threshold  population  that is required for establishment should be estimated.    S2  For  LMOs,  if  there  is  evidence  of  genotypic  and  phenotypic  instability,  this  should  be  considered.    S2  It may also be appropriate to consider proposed production and control practices related  to the LMO in the country of import.    2.2.3  Probability of spread after establishment  A  pest  with  a  high  potential  for  spread  may  also  have  a  high  potential  for  establishment,  and  possibilities  for  its  successful  containment  and/or  eradication  are  more  limited.  In  order  to  estimate  the  probability  of  spread  of  the  pest,  reliable  biological  information  should  be  obtained  from  areas  where  the  pest  currently occurs.  The  situation  in  the  PRA  area can then be carefully compared with that in the areas where the pest currently occurs  and  expert judgement used  to  assess  the  probability  of spread.  Case  histories concerning  comparable pests can usefully be considered. Examples of the factors to consider are:   suitability of the natural and/or managed environment for natural spread of the pest   presence of natural barriers   the potential for movement with commodities or conveyances   intended use of the commodity   potential vectors of the pest in the PRA area   potential natural enemies of the pest in the PRA area.    S1  In  the  case  of  plants  to  be  imported,  the  assessment  of  spread  concerns  spread  from  the  intended  habitat  or  the  intended  use  to  an  unintended  habitat,  where  the  pest  may  establish. Further spread may then occur to other unintended habitats.    The information on probability of spread is used to estimate how rapidly a pest's potential  economic importance may be expressed within the PRA area. This also has significance if  the pest is liable to enter and establish in an area of low potential economic importance and  then  spread  to  an  area  of  high  potential  economic  importance.  In  addition  it  may  be  important in the risk management stage when considering the feasibility of containment or  eradication of an introduced pest.    S1  Certain  pests  may  not  cause  injurious  effects  on  plants  immediately  after  they  establish,  and  in  particular  may  only  spread  after  a  certain  time.  In  assessing  the  probability  of  spread, this should be considered, based on evidence of such behaviour.       
120 

 

2.2.4  Conclusion on the probability of introduction and spread  The overall probability of introduction should be expressed in terms most suitable for the  data, the methods used for analysis, and the intended audience. This may be quantitative or  qualitative,  since  either  output  is  in  any  case  the  result  of  a  combination  of  both  quantitative and qualitative information. The probability of introduction may be expressed  as a comparison with that obtained from PRAs on other pests.    2.2.4.1  Conclusion regarding endangered areas  The  part  of  the  PRA  area  where  ecological  factors  favour  the  establishment  of  the  pest  should be identified in order to define the endangered area. This may be the whole of the  PRA area or a part of the area.    2.3  Assessment of potential economic consequences  Requirements described in this step indicate what information relative to the pest and its  potential  host  plants  should  be  assembled,  and  suggest  levels  of  economic  analysis  that  may be carried out using that information in order to assess all the effects of the pest, i.e.  the  potential  economic  consequences.  Wherever  appropriate,  quantitative  data  that  will  provide  monetary  values  should  be  obtained.  Qualitative  data  may  also  be  used.  Consultation with an economist may be useful.    In  many  instances,  detailed  analysis  of  the  estimated  economic  consequences  is  not  necessary if there is sufficient evidence or it is widely agreed that the introduction of a pest  will  have  unacceptable  economic  consequences  (including  environmental  consequences).  In  such  cases,  risk assessment  will  primarily  focus  on the  probability  of introduction and  spread. It will, however, be necessary to examine economic factors in greater detail when  the  level  of  economic  consequences  is  in  question,  or  when  the  level  of  economic  consequences is needed to evaluate the strength of measures used for risk management or  in assessing the costbenefit of exclusion or control.    S2  In the case of LMOs, the economic impact (including environmental impact) should relate  to the pest nature (injurious to plants and plant products) of the LMO.    S2  For LMOs, the following evidence should also be considered:   potential economic consequences that could result from adverse effects on nontarget  organisms that are injurious to plants or plant products   economic consequences that could result from pest properties.    S2  For more detailed guidance on the assessment of these characteristics, see Annex 3.    2.3.1  Pest effects  In order to estimate the potential economic importance of the pest, information should be  obtained  from  areas  where  the  pest  occurs  naturally  or  has  been  introduced.  This  information  should  be  compared  with  the  situation  in  the  PRA  area.  Case  histories  concerning  comparable  pests  can  usefully  be  considered.  The  effects  considered  may  be  direct or indirect. 
121 

 

S1  The basic method for estimating the potential economic importance of pests in this section  also applies to:   pests affecting uncultivated/unmanaged plants   weeds and/or invasive plants and   pests affecting plants through effects on other organisms.    S1  In the case of direct and indirect environmental effects, specific evidence is needed.    S1  In  the  case  of  plants  to  be  imported  for  planting,  the  longterm  consequences  for  the  intended  habitat  may  be  included  in  the  assessment.  Planting  may  affect  further  use  or  have a harmful effect on the intended habitat.    S1  Environmental  effects  and  consequences  considered  should  result  from  effects  on  plants.  Such  effects,  however,  on  plants  may  be  less  significant  than  the  effects  and/or  consequences  on  other  organisms  or  systems.  For  example,  a  minor  weed  may  be  significantly  allergenic  for  humans  or  a  minor  plant  pathogen  may  produce  toxins  that  seriously  affect  livestock.  However,  the  regulation  of  plants  solely  on  the  basis  of  their  effects on other organisms or systems (e.g. on human or animal health) is outside the scope  of  this  standard.  If  the  PRA  process  reveals  evidence  of  a  potential  hazard  to  other  organisms or systems, this should be communicated to the appropriate authorities which  have the legal responsibility to deal with the issue.    2.3.1.1  Direct pest effects  For  identification  and  characterization  of  the  direct  effects  of  the  pest  on  each  potential  host  in  the PRA  area,  or  those  effects  which  are  hostspecific,  the  following  are  examples  that could be considered:   known or potential host plants (in the field, under protected cultivation, or in the wild)   types, amount and frequency of damage   crop losses, in yield and quality   biotic factors (e.g. adaptability and virulence of the pest) affecting damage and losses   abiotic factors (e.g. climate) affecting damage and losses   rate of spread   rate of reproduction   control measures (including existing measures), their efficacy and cost   effect on existing production practices   environmental effects.    For each of the potential hosts, the total area of the crop and area potentially endangered  should be estimated in relation to the elements given above.    S1  In the case of the analysis of environmental risks, examples of direct pest effects on plants  and/or their environmental consequences that could be considered include:   reduction of keystone plant species;   reduction  of  plant  species  that  are  major  components  of  ecosystems  (in  terms  of  abundance  or  size),  and  endangered  native  plant  species  (including  effects  below 
122 

 

species level where there is evidence of such effects being significant);   significant reduction, displacement or elimination of other plant species.    S1  The estimation of the area potentially endangered should relate to these effects.    2.3.1.2  Indirect pest effects  For identification and characterization of the indirect effects of the pest in the PRA area, or  those  effects  that  are  not  hostspecific,  the  following  are  examples  that  could  be  considered:   effects  on  domestic  and  export  markets,  including  in  particular  effects  on  export  market access. The potential consequences for market access which may result if the  pest becomes established, should be estimated. This involves considering the extent of  any phytosanitary regulations imposed (or likely to be imposed) by trading partners   changes to producer costs or input demands, including control costs   changes to domestic or foreign consumer demand for a product resulting from quality  changes   environmental and other undesired effects of control measures   feasibility and cost of eradication or containment   capacity to act as a vector for other pests   resources needed for additional research and advice   social and other effects (e.g. tourism).    S1  In  the  case  of  the  analysis  of  environmental  risks,  examples  of  indirect  pest  effects  on  plants and/or their environmental consequences that could be considered include:   significant effects on plant communities   significant effects on designated environmentally sensitive or protected areas   significant change in ecological processes and the structure, stability or processes of an  ecosystem  (including  further  effects  on  plant  species,  erosion,  water  table  changes,  increased fire hazard, nutrient cycling, etc.)   effects  on  human  use  (e.g.  water  quality,  recreational  uses,  tourism,  animal  grazing,  hunting, fishing); and   costs of environmental restoration.    S1  Effects on human and animal health (e.g. toxicity, allergenicity), water tables, tourism, etc.  could also be considered, as appropriate, by other agencies/authorities.    2.3.2  Analysis of economic consequences  2.3.2.1  Time and place factors  Estimations made in the previous section related to a hypothetical situation where the pest  is  supposed  to  have  been  introduced  and  to  be  fully  expressing  its  potential  economic  consequences (per year) in the PRA area. In practice, however, economic consequences are  expressed with time, and may concern one year, several years or an indeterminate period.  Various scenarios should be considered. The total economic consequences over more than  one year can be expressed as net present value of annual economic consequences, and an  appropriate discount rate selected to calculate net present value. 
123 

 

Other scenarios could concern whether the pest occurs at one, few or many points in the  PRA area and the expression of potential economic consequences will depend on the rate  and manner of spread in the PRA area. The rate of spread may be envisaged to be slow or  rapid;  in  some  cases,  it  may  be  supposed  that  spread  can  be  prevented.  Appropriate  analysis may be used to estimate potential economic consequences over the period of time  when  a  pest  is  spreading  in  the  PRA  area.  In  addition,  many  of  the  factors  or  effects  considered  above  could  be  expected  to  change  over  time,  with  the  consequent  effects  of  potential economic consequences. Expert judgement and estimations will be required.    2.3.2.2  Analysis of commercial consequences  As determined above, most of the direct effects of a pest, and some of the indirect effects  will  be  of  a  commercial  nature,  or  have  consequences  for  an  identified  market.  These  effects,  which  may  be  positive  or  negative,  should  be  identified  and  quantified.  The  following may usefully be considered:   effect  of  pestinduced  changes  to  producer  profits  that  result  from  changes  in  production costs, yields or prices   effect of pestinduced changes in quantities demanded or prices paid for commodities  by  domestic  and  international  consumers.  This  could  include  quality  changes  in  products  and/or  quarantinerelated  trade  restrictions  resulting  from  a  pest  introduction.    2.3.2.3  Analytical techniques  There  are  analytical  techniques  which  can  be  used  in  consultation  with  experts  in  economics  to  make  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  potential  economic  effects  of  a  quarantine pest. These should incorporate all of the effects that have been identified. These  techniques may include:   partial budgeting: this will be adequate, if the economic effects induced by the action of  the pest to producer profits are generally limited to producers and are considered to  be relatively minor   partial  equilibrium:  this  is  recommended  if,  under  point  2.3.2.2,  there  is  a  significant  change  in  producer  profits,  or  if  there  is  a  significant  change  in  consumer  demand.  Partial  equilibrium  analysis  is  necessary  to  measure  welfare  changes,  or  the  net  changes arising from the pest impacts on producers and consumers   general  equilibrium: if the economic changes are significant to a national economy, and  could  cause  changes  to  factors  such  as  wages,  interest  rates  or  exchange  rates,  then  general  equilibrium  analysis  could  be  used  to  establish  the  full  range  of  economic  effects.    The use of analytical techniques is often limited by lack of data, by uncertainties in the data,  and by the fact that for certain effects only qualitative information can be provided.    2.3.2.4  Noncommercial and environmental consequences  Some of the direct and indirect effects of the introduction of a pest determined in 2.3.1.1  and  2.3.1.2  will  be  of  an  economic  nature,  or  affect  some  type  of  value,  but  not  have  an  existing  market  which  can  be  easily  identified.  As  a  result,  the  effects  may  not  be 
124 

 

 

adequately  measured  in  terms  of  prices  in  established  product  or  service  markets.  Examples  include  in  particular  environmental  effects  (such  as  ecosystem  stability,  biodiversity, amenity value) and social effects (such as employment, tourism) arising from  a pest introduction. These impacts could be approximated with an appropriate nonmarket  valuation method. More details on environment are given below.    If quantitative measurement of such consequences is not feasible, qualitative information  about the consequences may be provided. An explanation of how this information has been  incorporated into decisions should also be provided.    S1  Application  of  this  standard  to  environmental  hazards  requires  clear  categorization  of  environmental values and how they can be assessed. The environment can be valued using  different  methodologies,  but  these  methodologies  are  best  used  in  consultation  with  experts  in  economics.  Methodologies  may  include  consideration  of  "use"  and  "nonuse"  values.  "Use"  values  arise  from  consumption  of  an  element  of  the  environment,  such  as  accessing clean water, or fishing in a lake, and also those that are nonconsumptive, such as  use of forests for leisure activities. "Nonuse" values may be subdivided into:   "option value" (value for use at a later date)   "existence value" (knowledge that an element of the environment exists) and   "bequest value" (knowledge that an element of the environment is available for future  generations).    S1  Whether  the  element  of  the  environment  is  being  assessed  in  terms  of  use  or  nonuse  values,  methods  exist  for  their  valuation,  such  as  marketbased  approaches,  surrogate  markets, simulated markets, and benefit transfer. Each has advantages, disadvantages and  situations where it is particularly useful.  S1  The  assessment  of  consequences  may  be  either  quantitative  or  qualitative  and  in  many  cases,  qualitative  data  is  sufficient.  A  quantitative  method  may  not  exist  to  address  a  situation (e.g. catastrophic effects on a keystone species), or a quantitative analysis may not  be  possible  (no  methods  available).  Useful  analyses  can  be  based  on  nonmonetary  valuations (number of species affected, water quality), or expert judgement, if the analyses  follow documented, consistent and transparent procedures. 

 

S1  Economic impact is described in ISPM No. 5: Glossary of phytosanitary terms, Supplement  No.  2:  Guidelines  on  the  understanding  of  potential  economic  importance  and  related  terms.    2.3.3  Conclusion of the assessment of economic consequences  Wherever appropriate, the output of the assessment of economic consequences described  in this step should be in terms of a monetary value. The economic consequences can also be  expressed qualitatively or using quantitative measures without monetary terms. Sources of  information, assumptions and methods of analysis should be clearly specified.     
125 

 

2.3.3.1  Endangered area  The part of the PRA area where presence of the pest will result in economically important  loss should be identified as appropriate. This is needed to define the endangered area.    2.4  Degree of uncertainty  Estimation  of  the  probability  of  introduction  of  a  pest  and  of  its  economic  consequences  involves  many  uncertainties.  In  particular,  this  estimation  is  an  extrapolation  from  the  situation where the pest occurs to the hypothetical situation in the PRA area. It is important  to document the areas of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in the assessment, and  to indicate where expert judgment has been used. This is necessary for transparency and  may also be useful for identifying and prioritizing research needs.    S1  It  should  be  noted  that  the  assessment  of  the  probability  and  consequences  of  environmental  hazards  of  pests  of  uncultivated  and  unmanaged  plants  often  involves  greater uncertainty than for pests of cultivated or managed plants. This is due to the lack of  information,  additional  complexity  associated  with  ecosystems,  and  variability  associated  with pests, hosts or habitats.    2.5  Conclusion of the pest risk assessment stage  As  a  result  of  the  pest  risk  assessment,  all  or  some  of  the  categorized  pests  may  be  considered appropriate for pest risk management. For each pest, all or part of the PRA area  may  be  identified  as  an  endangered  area.  A  quantitative  or  qualitative  estimate  of  the  probability  of  introduction  of  a  pest  or  pests,  and  a  corresponding  quantitative  or  qualitative  estimate  of  economic  consequences  (including  environmental  consequences),  have been obtained and documented or an overall rating could have been assigned. These  estimates, with associated uncertainties, are utilized in the pest risk management stage of  the PRA.    3.  Stage 3: Pest Risk Management  The conclusions from pest risk assessment are used to decide whether risk management is  required  and  the  strength  of  measures  to  be  used.  Since  zerorisk  is  not  a  reasonable  option, the guiding principle for risk management should be to manage risk to achieve the  required degree of safety that can be justified and is feasible within the limits of available  options  and  resources.  Pest  risk  management  (in  the  analytical  sense)  is  the  process  of  identifying  ways  to  react  to  a  perceived  risk,  evaluating  the  efficacy  of  these  actions,  and  identifying  the  most  appropriate  options.  The  uncertainty  noted  in  the  assessments  of  economic  consequences  and  probability  of  introduction  should  also  be  considered  and  included in the selection of a pest management option.    S1  In  considering  the  management  of  environmental  risks,  it  should  be  stressed  that  phytosanitary measures are intended to account for uncertainty and should be designed in  proportion to the risk. Pest risk management options should be identified, taking account  of  the  degree  of  uncertainty  in  the  assessment  of  economic  consequences,  probability  of  introduction, and the respective technical justification of those options. In this respect, the  management  of  risks  to  the  environment  caused  by  plant  pests  does  not  differ  from  the  management of other plant pest risks. 
126 

 

3.1  Level of risk  The  principle  of  "managed  risk"  (ISPM  No.  1:  Principles  of  plant  quarantine  as  related  to  international  trade)  states  that:  "Because  some  risk  of  introduction  of  a  quarantine  pest  always  exists,  countries  shall  agree  to  a  policy  of  risk  management  when  formulating  phytosanitary  measures."  In  implementing  this  principle,  countries  should  decide  what  level of risk is acceptable to them.    The acceptable level of risk may be expressed in a number of ways, such as:   reference to existing phytosanitary requirements   indexed to estimated economic losses   expressed on a scale of risk tolerance   compared with the level of risk accepted by other countries.    S2  For LMOs, the acceptable level of risk may also be expressed by comparison to the level of  risk  associated  with  similar  or  related  organisms,  based  on  their  characteristics  and  behaviour in a similar environment to the PRA area.    3.2  Technical information required  The  decisions  to  be  made  in  the  pest  risk  management  process  will  be  based  on  the  information  collected  during  the  preceding  stages  of  PRA.  This  information  will  be  composed of:   reasons for initiating the process   estimation of the probability of introduction to the PRA area   evaluation of potential economic consequences in the PRA area.    3.3  Acceptability of risk  Overall  risk  is  determined  by  the  examination  of  the  outputs  of  the  assessments  of  the  probability of introduction and the economic impact. If the risk is found to be unacceptable,  then the first step in risk management is to identify possible phytosanitary measures that  will reduce the risk to, or below an acceptable level. Measures are not justified if the risk is  already acceptable or must be accepted because it is not manageable (as may be the case  with  natural  spread).  Countries  may  decide  that  a  low  level  of  monitoring  or  audit  is  maintained to ensure that future changes in the pest risk are identified.    3.4  Identification and selection of appropriate risk management options  Appropriate  measures  should  be  chosen  based  on  their  effectiveness  in  reducing  the  probability  of  introduction  of  the  pest.  The  choice  should  be  based  on  the  following  considerations,  which  include  several  of  the  Principles  of  plant  quarantine  as  related  to  international trade (ISPM No. 1):   Phytosanitary  measures  shown  to  be  costeffective  and  feasible    The  benefit  from  the  use of phytosanitary measures is that the pest will not be introduced and the PRA area  will, consequently, not be subjected to the potential economic consequences. The cost benefit  analysis  for  each  of  the  minimum  measures  found  to  provide  acceptable  security  may  be  estimated.  Those  measures  with  an  acceptable  benefittocost  ratio  should be considered. 
127 

 

 Principle  of  "minimal  impact"    Measures  should  not  be  more  trade  restrictive  than  necessary. Measures should be applied to the minimum area necessary for the effective  protection of the endangered area.   Reassessment  of  previous  requirements  No additional measures should be imposed if  existing measures are effective.   Principle of "equivalence"  If different phytosanitary measures with the same effect are  identified, they should be accepted as alternatives.   Principle  of  "nondiscrimination"  If the pest under consideration is established in the  PRA  area  but  of  limited  distribution  and  under  official  control,  the  phytosanitary  measures in relation to import should not be more stringent than those applied within  the  PRA  area.  Likewise,  phytosanitary  measures  should  not  discriminate  between  exporting countries of the same phytosanitary status.    S1  The principle of nondiscrimination and the concept of official control also apply to:   pests affecting uncultivated/unmanaged plants   weeds and/or invasive plants and   pests affecting plants through effects on other organisms.    S1  If  any  of  these  become  established  in  the  PRA  area  and  if  official  control  is  applied,  then  phytosanitary  measures  at  import  should  not  be  more  stringent  than  the  official  control  measures.    The major risk of introduction of plant pests is with imported consignments of plants and  plant products, but (especially for a PRA performed on a particular pest) it is necessary to  consider  the  risk  of  introduction  with  other  types  of  pathways  (e.g.  packing  materials,  conveyances, travellers and their luggage, and the natural spread of a pest).    The  measures  listed  below  are  examples  of  those  that  are  most  commonly  applied  to  traded commodities. They are applied to pathways, usually consignments of a host, from a  specific  origin.  The  measures  should  be  as  precise  as  possible  as  to  consignment  type  (hosts, parts of plants) and origin so as not to act as barriers to trade by limiting the import  of  products  where  this  is  not  justified.  Combinations  of  two  or  more  measures  may  be  needed  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  to  an  acceptable  level.  The  available  measures  can  be  classified  into  broad  categories  which  relate  to  the  pest  status  of  the  pathway  in  the  country of origin. These include measures:   applied to the consignment   applied to prevent or reduce original infestation in the crop   to ensure the area or place of production is free from the pest   concerning the prohibition of commodities.    Other options may arise in the PRA area (restrictions on the use of a commodity), control  measures,  introduction  of  a  biological  control  agent,  eradication,  and  containment.  Such  options should also be evaluated and will apply in particular if the pest is already present  but not widely distributed in the PRA area.   
128 

 

3.4.1  Options for consignments  Measures may include any combinations of the following:   inspection or testing for freedom from a pest or to a specified pest tolerance; sample  size should be adequate to give an acceptable probability of detecting the pest   prohibition of parts of the host   a  preentry  or  postentry  quarantine  system    this  system  could  be  considered  to  be  the most intensive form of inspection or testing where suitable facilities and resources  are available, and may be the only option for certain pests not detectable on entry   specified  conditions  of  preparation  of  the  consignment  (e.g.  handling  to  prevent  infestation or reinfestation)   specified treatment of the consignment  such treatments are applied postharvest and  could include chemical, thermal, irradiation or other physical methods   restrictions on end use, distribution and periods of entry of the commodity.    Measures may also be applied to restrict the import of consignments of pests.     S1  The concept of consignments of pests may be applied to the import of plants considered to  be pests. These consignments may be restricted to species or varieties posing less risk.    S2  For LMOs, as for other organisms, information may have been obtained concerning the risk  management measures applied to the LMO in the country of export (see section 1.3). These  should be assessed to determine if they are appropriate for the conditions in the PRA area  and, if appropriate, the intended use.    S2  For LMOs, measures may also include procedures for the provision of information on the  phytosanitary  integrity  of  consignments  (e.g.  tracing  systems,  documentation  systems,  identity preservation systems).    3.4.2  Options preventing or reducing infestation in the crop  Measures may include:   treatment of the crop, field, or place of production   restriction  of  the  composition  of  a  consignment  so  that  it  is  composed  of  plants  belonging to resistant or less susceptible species   growing plants under specially protected conditions (glasshouse, isolation)   harvesting of plants at a certain age or a specified time of year   production in a certification scheme. An officially monitored plant production scheme  usually involves a number of carefully controlled generations, beginning with nuclear  stock plants of high health status. It may be specified that the plants be derived from  plants within a limited number of generations.    S2  Measures  may  be  applied  to  reduce  the  probability  that  LMOs  (or  genetic  material  from  LMOs) that pose a phytosanitary risk could be in other crops. These include:   management systems (e.g. buffer zones, refugia)   management of trait expression   control of reproductive ability (e.g. male sterility) 
129 

 

 control of alternative hosts.    3.4.3  Options  ensuring  that  the  area,  place  or  site  of  production  or  crop  is  free  from  the pest  Measures may include:   pestfree  area    requirements  for  pestfree  area  status  are  described  in  ISPM  No.  4:  Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas   pestfree place of production or pestfree production site  requirements are described  in ISPM No. 10:  Requirements  for  the  establishment  of  pest  free  places  of  production  and  pestfree production sites   inspection of crop to confirm pest freedom.    3.4.4  Options for other types of pathways  For many types of pathways, the measures considered above for plants and plant products  to detect the pest in the consignment or to prevent infestation of the consignment, may also  be  used  or  adapted.  For  certain  types  of  pathways,  the  following  factors  should  be  considered:   Natural  spread  of  a  pest  includes  movement  of  the  pest  by  flight,  wind  dispersal,  transport  by  vectors  such  as  insects  or  birds  and  natural  migration.  If  the  pest  is  entering the PRA area by natural spread, or is likely to enter in the immediate future,  phytosanitary measures may have little effect. Control measures applied in the area of  origin  could  be  considered.  Similarly,  containment  or  eradication,  supported  by  suppression  and  surveillance,  in  the  PRA  area  after  entry  of  the  pest  could  be  considered.   Measures  for  human  travellers  and  their  baggage  could  include  targeted  inspections,  publicity and fines or incentives. In a few cases, treatments may be possible.   Contaminated machinery or modes of transport (ships, trains, planes, road transport)  could be subjected to cleaning or disinfestation.    3.4.5  Options within the importing country  Certain  measures  applied  within  the  importing  country  may  also  be  used.  These  could  include  careful  surveillance  to  try  and  detect  the  entry  of  the  pest  as  early  as  possible,  eradication programmes to eliminate any foci of infestation and/or containment action to  limit spread.    S1  For plants to be imported, where there is a high level of uncertainty regarding pest risk, it  may  be  decided  not  to  take  phytosanitary  measures  at  import,  but  only  to  apply  surveillance or other procedures after entry (e.g. by or under the supervision of the NPPO).    S2  The  potential  for  risk  from  LMO  pests  depends  in  part  on  the  intended  use.  As  for  other  organisms,  certain  intended  uses  (such  as  high  security  contained  use)  may  significantly  manage risk.   

130 

 

S2  For  LMOs,  as  with  other  pests,  options  within  the  country  also  include  the  use  of  emergency  measures  related  to  phytosanitary  risks.  Any  emergency  measures  should  be  consistent with Article VII.6 of the IPPC (1997).    3.4.6  Prohibition of commodities  If  no  satisfactory  measure  to  reduce  risk  to  an  acceptable  level  can  be  found,  the  final  option may be to prohibit importation of the relevant commodities. This should be viewed  as  a  measure  of  last  resort  and  should  be  considered  in  light  of  the  anticipated  efficacy,  especially in instances where the incentives for illegal import may be significant.    3.5  Phytosanitary certificates and other compliance measures  Risk  management  includes  the  consideration  of  appropriate  compliance  procedures.  The  most important of these is export certification (see ISPM No. 7: Export certification system).  The  issuance  of  phytosanitary  certificates  (see  ISPM  No.  12:  Guidelines  for  Phytosanitary  Certificates) provides official assurance that a consignment is "considered to be free from  the quarantine pests specified by the importing contracting party and to conform with the  current  phytosanitary  requirements  of  the  importing  contracting  party."  It  thus  confirms  that the specified risk management options have been followed. An additional declaration  may  be  required  to  indicate  that  a  particular  measure  has  been  carried  out.  Other  compliance measures may be used subject to bilateral or multilateral agreement.    S2  Information  on  Phytosanitary  Certificates  regarding  LMOs  (as  with  any  other  regulated  articles) should only be related to phytosanitary measures (see ISPM No. 12:  Guidelines  for  phytosanitary certificates).    3.6  Conclusion of pest risk management  The  result  of  the  pest  risk  management  procedure  will  be  either  that  no  measures  are  identified which are considered appropriate or the selection of one or more management  options that have been found to lower the risk associated with the pest(s) to an acceptable  level.  These  management  options  form  the  basis  of  phytosanitary  regulations  or  requirements.    The application and maintenance of such regulations is subject to certain obligations, in the  case of contracting parties to the IPPC.    S1  Phytosanitary measures taken in relation to environmental hazards should, as appropriate,  be notified to relevant competent authorities responsible for national biodiversity policies,  strategies and action plans.    S1  It  is  noted  that  the  communication  of  risks  associated  with  environmental  hazards  is  of  particular importance to promote awareness.    3.6.1  Monitoring and review of phytosanitary measures  The  principle  of  "modification"  states:  "As  conditions  change,  and  as  new  facts  become  available,  phytosanitary  measures  shall  be  modified  promptly,  either  by  inclusion  of  prohibitions,  restrictions  or  requirements  necessary  for  their  success,  or  by  removal  of 
131 

 

those  found  to  be  unnecessary"  (ISPM  No.  1:  Principles  of  plant  quarantine  as  related  to  international trade).    Thus, the implementation of particular phytosanitary measures should not be considered  to  be  permanent.  After  application,  the  success  of  the  measures  in  achieving  their  aim  should be determined by monitoring during use. This is often achieved by inspection of the  commodity on arrival, noting any interceptions or any entries of the pest to the PRA area.  The  information  supporting  the  pest  risk  analysis  should  be  periodically  reviewed  to  ensure  that  any  new  information  that  becomes  available  does  not  invalidate  the  decision  taken.    4.  Documentation of Pest Risk Analysis  4.1  Documentation requirements  The IPPC and the principle of "transparency" (ISPM No. 1:  Principles  of  plant  quarantine  as  related to international trade) require that countries should, on request, make available the  rationale  for  phytosanitary  requirements.  The  whole  process  from  initiation  to  pest  risk  management should be sufficiently documented so that when a review or a dispute arises,  the sources of information and rationale used in reaching the management decision can be  clearly demonstrated.    The main elements of documentation are:   purpose for the PRA   pest, pest list, pathways, PRA area, endangered area   sources of information   categorized pest list   conclusions of risk assessment  probability  consequences   risk management  options identified   options selected.

Appendix 3:  Weed  initiated  pest  risk  assessment  guidelines  for  qualitative  assessments (USDA, APHIS, 2004)    INTRODUCTION   The  Animal  and  Plant  Health  Inspection  Service  (APHIS)  regulates  noxious  weeds  under  the  authority  of  the  Plant  Protection  Act  (PPA).  APHIS  names  the  regulated  weeds  in  the  noxious weed regulations (7 CFR 360) in order to ensure transparency. Listed kinds may  not  be  imported  into  the  United  States,  or  moved  interstate,  without  a  special  permit.  APHIS  uses  risk  assessments  as  a  basis  for  weed  exclusion  decisions.  This  document  presents  guidelines  for  conducting  pestinitiated,  qualitative  pest  risk  assessments  specifically for determining whether or not a weed species should be listed in (or delisted  from) the noxious weed regulations.     In  a  qualitative  assessment  we  estimate  risk  in  terms  such  as  high  or  low  as  opposed  to  numerical  terms  such  as  probabilities  or  frequencies.  Plant  Protection  and  Quarantine  (PPQ) risk assessment procedures are harmonized with those of the North American Plant  Protection Organization (NAPPO) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)  of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our use of biological and  phytosanitary  terms  (e.g.,  introduction,  quarantine  pest)  conforms  with  the  NAPPO  Compendium  of  Phytosanitary  Terms  (NAPPO  1995)  and  the  Definitions  and  Abbreviations  (Introduction  Section)  in  International  Standards  for  Phytosanitary  Measures,  Section  1-- Import Regulations: Guidelines for Pest Risk Analysis (FAO 1995).     Pest risk assessment is a component of pest risk analysis. FAO (1995) guidelines describe  three stages in pest risk.  This document provides a template for conducting FAO stages 1  and 2. APHIS completes eight basic steps in weedinitiated plant pest risk assessments:           Stage 1: Initiating the process by identifying a pest that may qualify as a quarantine  pest, and/or pathways that may allow introduction or spread of a quarantine pest.   Stage  2:  Assessing  pest  risk  (determining  which  pests  are  quarantine  pests,  characterized  in  terms  of  likelihood  of  entry,  establishment,  spread,  and  economic  importance).   Stage  3:  Managing  pest  risk  (developing,  evaluating,  comparing,  and  selecting  options for dealing with the risk).   Step 4: Verifying quarantine pest status: Geographic and regulatory criteria.   Step  5:  Assess  economic  and  environmental  importance:  Consequences  of  introduction.  Step 6: Assess likelihood of introduction.   Step 7: Conclusion/Determine pest risk potential (PRP) of weed.  Step 8: Document the PRA, cite references. 

  METHODS: PEST RISK ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES     This section provides instructions for preparing the pest risk assessment.

Stage 1: Initiating Pest Risk Analysis Process     Step 1: Document the Initiating Event(s) for the Pest Risk Assessment   A new or revised pest risk assessment for a specific weed will be required in the following  situations (including, but not limited to):   Â· discovery of an established infestation or an outbreak of a new weed   Â· through research, identification of a new weed risk   Â· proposal from outside APHIS for listing a new weed under the Plant Protection Act   Â· proposal for delisting a weed already on the list.     Step 2. Identify and Cite Previous Risk Assessments.   Identify previous pest risk assessments for the same weed or a close relative. If an existing  document  adequately  assesses  the  risks  in  question,  determine  if  it  is  entirely  or  partly  valid. If a previous assessment is entirely valid, the risk assessment stops here.     Step 3. Establish Identity of Weed   Define  the  weed  as  a  taxon  that  can  be  adequately  distinguished  from  other  taxa  of  the  same rank. Include:     Scientific  Name:  Order,  Family,  Genus,  and  species.  (If  the  weed  cannot  be  clearly  distinguished  from  other  taxa  of  the  same  rank,  the  assessment  stops  here.)  Common  name(s)  Synonym(s)  Description,  morphology  Weed  biology  (growth,  development  and  reproduction) Climatic tolerance Native and current worldwide distribution Key characters  for identification     Note: Step 3 can be created in a standalone format, and used as a pest data sheet. If this is  done, add to the above a summary of detection and inspection methods, pest significance  (i.e.,  economic  and  environmental  impacts)  and  control/management  options.  Attach  a  separate bibliography for the data sheet.     Stage 2: Assessing Pest Risk     Step 4. Verify Quarantine Pest Status: Regulatory and Geographic Criteria   Determine  whether  or  not  the  weed  satisfies  regulatory  and  geographic  criteria  as  a  quarantine pest.     Regulatory: APHIS accepts the FAO (1995) and NAPPO (1995) definition of a quarantine  pest  as  one  having  "potential  economic  importance  to  the  area  endangered  thereby  and  not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled"  If  a  weed  is  present  but  not  widely  distributed,  identify  local,  state,  and  federal  control  efforts  for  each  occurrence  of  the  species  in  the  United  States.  If  there  are  no  current  control efforts in place, you may discuss and recommend an official control program in the  conclusion (Step 7) of the risk assessment.     Geographic:  The  weedinitiated  risk  assessment  should  first  establish  that  the  weed  satisfies  the  geographic  criteria.  Describe  the  history  of  introduction  and  the  weed's 
134 

 

current distribution in the United States. If the weed is native, or has reached the limits of  its  ecological  range  (i.e.,  is  widely  distributed),  then  the  weed  does  not  satisfy  the  definition of a quarantine pest and the pest risk assessment stops here.     Step 5. Assess Economic and Environmental Importance: Consequences of Introduction.   Estimate the economic and environmental consequences of introduction, considering ". . .  the  establishment,  spread  and  economic  importance  potential  in  the  PRA  area"  (FAO,  1995).  The  weedinitiated  risk  assessment  should  establish  that  the  weed  is  of  potential  economic  importance  by  considering  the  consequences  and  likelihood  of  introduction.  In  qualitative pest risk assessments, we use five Risk Elements (RE) to estimate risk. RE #14  focus  on  the  consequences  of  introduction  and  RE  #  5  focuses  on  the  likelihood  of  introduction.     Rate the potential consequences of introduction according to RE #15. These elements  reflect the biology of the weed and its hosts. Rate each RE, from highest (3) to lowest  (0). Discuss the rationale for each rating; cite references.     RE #1: Habitat Suitability   A  weed  may  behave  in  its  area  of  introduction  as  it  does  in  its  native  area  if  climatic  conditions  are  similar.  For  this  element,  we  base  estimates  on  suitable  climate  and  habitat conditions. For a parasitic weed, the evaluation also considers the availability of  host  material.  To  rate  this  RE,  you  may  consider  the  U.S.  "plant  hardiness  zones"  as  described by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA, 1990). You may use the climate  matching  software  CLIMEX,  which  is  available  from  the  Hearne  Scientific  Software  website at www.hearne.com.au.     Assign rating as follows:   Suitable climate and habitats (and availability of host plants, if the organism is a parasitic  plant) would permit the weed to survive and establish:     Rating Numerical Score Explanation     High     3   In most or all of the United States (generally, in more than four  plant hardiness zones).   Medium     2   Approximately one third to two thirds of the USA (generally, in        (generally, in three or four plant hardiness zones).   Low     1   Approximately one third or less of the United States (generally, in  one or two plant hardiness zone).   Negligible     0   No potential to survive and become established in the PRA area.     Discuss  your  rationale  for  the  rating  and  the  level  of  certainty.    If  the  quarantine  weed  cannot become established in the PRA area because of unsuitable climate (or lack of hosts,  if  the  weed  is  a  parasite),  the  pest  risk  assessment  stops  here.    RE #2: Spread potential after establishment, Dispersal Potential.   Discuss the biological attributes of the species that allow it to spread and identify dispersal 
135 

 

mechanisms. For example, determine which of the following apply:   Â· Consistent and prolific seed production   Â· Rapid growth to reproductive maturity   Â· High germination rate under a wide range of conditions   Â· Ability to suppress the growth of other plants by releasing a chemical inhibitor   Â· Ability  to  persist  as  dormant  longlived  propagules  or  underground  parts,  such  as  rhizomes, tubers, turions or stolons   Â· Seed dormancy   Â· Stress tolerance, including ability to resist herbicides   Â· Ability to colonize a wide variety of habitats   Â· Lack of natural control agents   Â· Welldeveloped storage tissue (for example, tap root)   Â· Dispersal by wind, water, machinery, animals, and/or humans     Assign rating as follows:   Rating Numerical score Explanation   High  Medium   Low   3  2  1  Weed  has  potential  for  rapid  natural  spread  throughout  its  potential  range  in  the  PRA  area  (e.g.,  high  reproductive  potential  AND highly mobile propagules)   Weed has potential for natural spread throughout a physiographic  region  of  the  PRA  area  within  a  year  (e.g.,  it  has  either  high  reproductive potential OR highly mobile propagules).  Weed  has  potential  for  natural  spread  locally  in  the  PRA  area  within  a  year  (some  reproductive  potential  and/or  some  mobility of propagules).   Weed has no potential for natural spread in the PRA area  

Negligible   0    Discuss your rationale for the rating and the level of certainty.     RE #3: Economic Impact Rating   Introduced weeds can cause a variety of economic impacts. We divide these impacts into  three primary categories (other types of impacts may occur):   1 Reduced crop yield (e.g., by parasitism, competition, or by harboring other pests).   2 Lower commodity value (e.g., by increasing costs of production, lowering market     price, or a combination); or if not an agricultural weed, by increasing costs of control.   3 Loss of markets (foreign or domestic) due to presence of a new quarantine pest.     Assign ratings as follows:   Rating Numerical score Explanation     High     3   Weed causes all three of the above impacts, or causes any two  impacts over a wide range (over 5 types) of economic plants, plant  products, or animals.   Medium   2   Weed causes any two of the above impacts, or causes any one   impact to a wide range (over 5 types) of economic plants, plant    
136 

 

Low   1   Negligible   0     Discuss your rationale for the rating and the level of certainty.     RE #4: Environmental Impact   Consider whether or not the weed, if introduced, could:   Â· Cause impacts on ecosystem processes (alteration of hydrology, sedimentation rates, a  fire regime, nutrient regimes, changes in productivity, growth, yield, vigor, etc.)   Â· Cause  impacts  on  natural  community  composition  (e.g.,  reduce  biodiversity,  affect  native populations, affect endangered or threatened species, impact keystone species,  impact native fauna, pollinators, or microorganisms, etc.)   Â· Cause  impacts  on  community  structure  (e.g.,  change  density  of  a  layer,  cover  the  canopy, eliminate or create a layer, impact wildlife habitats, etc.)   Â· Have impacts on human health such as allergies or changes in air or water quality.   Â· Have sociological impacts on recreation patterns and aesthetic or property values.   Â· Stimulate  control  programs  including  toxic  chemical  pesticides  or  introduction  of  a  nonindigenous biological control agent.     Assign ratings as follows:   Rating Numerical Score Explanation     High       3   Three or more of the above. (Potential to cause major damage to           the environment with significant losses to plant ecosystems and          subsequent physical environmental degradation). (Population    reduction of endangered or threatened species  would elevate that  one factor to a high rating.)   Medium     2   Two of the above. (Potential to cause moderate impact on the         environment with obvious change in the ecological balance,         affecting several attributes of the ecosystem, as well as moderate        recreation or aesthetic impacts.)   Low     1   One of the above, unless the factor is potential to reduce         populations of endangered or threatened species, which rates        High. (Limited potential impact on environment.)   Negligible     0   None of the above. (No potential to degrade the environment or        otherwise affect ecosystems.)     Discuss your rationale for the rating and the level of certainty.     ECONOMIC and ENVIRONMENTAL IMPORTANCE SUMMARY:   Consequences of Introduction: Cumulative Risk Element Score     Add  together  the  numerical  estimates  for  the  four  risk  elements  to  produce  an  overall  estimate  of  the  Consequences  of  Introduction  Risk  Rating  for  the  weed.  The  overall  risk  rating is used to assign a Consequences of Introduction Risk Score as follows:  
137 

products, or animals.   Weed causes any one of the above impacts.   Weed causes none of the above impacts.

Assess Likelihood of Introduction/Spread   The final stage is an assessment of introduction and spread potential, which depends  on  the  number  of  pathways  from  the  exporting  country  to  the  destination  and  the  subsequent opportunities to spread once an organism has arrived.   Consider:   Â· Interest in cultivation of the species for ornament, food, medicine, or other uses.   Â· Evidence of previous importation   Â· Species prevalence in area of origin   Â· Potential for contamination of commodities or conveyances by the species   Â· Whether the species can survive under the environmental conditions of shipment   Â· Ease or difficulty of detection through visual inspection   Â· Probability of surviving existing phytosanitary procedures   Â· Frequency and quantity of pest movement into the PRA area by named means   Â· Number and frequency of shipments of contaminated commodities   Â· Number  of  individuals  of  the  species  associated  with  each  named  conveyance  or  commodity   Â· Intended use of named commodities   Â· Season of arrival and distribution of commodities     Assign ratings as follows:   Rating Numerical Score Explanation:     High   3   Very likely or certain, given the combination of factors above   Medium   2   Likely   Low   1   Low, but clearly possible   Negligible   0   Extremely unlikely     Discuss the rationale for your rating and the level of certainty.

Appendix 4:  Advisory from CFIA regarding importation of aquatic plants 
 

February 2007     CFIA Import restrictions for certain aquatic plants   PIJAC  Canada  has  been  advised  that  the  Canadian  Food  Inspection  Agency  (CFIA)  is  currently  reviewing  its  policy  on  aquatic  plants  as  part  of  the  Government  of  Canada's  initiative on invasive alien species. As a result, certain aquatic plants that may pose a risk of  becoming  invasive  plants,  will  not  be  allowed  entry  into  Canada  until  a  pest  risk  assessment  has  been  completed.  Once  completed,  the  CFIA's  aquatic  plants  policy  will  be  finalized  and  posted  on  the  CFIA  web  site.  Importers  of  aquatic  plants  will  be  notified  accordingly.     CFIA  officials  have  also  indicated  that,  pending  further  notice,  all  applications  for  import  permits for aquatic plant species will be evaluated on a casebycase basis. If the species is  deemed as posing no threat, CFIA will process the application and issue the permits. If the  species  is  considered  to  be  higher  risk,  it  will  be  subject  to  a  risk  assessment.  The  risk  assessment will be conducted by the CFIA, at no cost to the importer. If, further to the risk  assessment, the species is deemed as posing no threat, the CFIA will allow importation. If it  is deemed as posing a threat, importation will not be permitted.     The following plant species have been identified as requiring a risk assessment and will not  be allowed into the country until the assessment has been completed:   Cardamine impatiens L.   Crassula helmsii A. Berger   Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle   Limnophila indica (L.) Druce   Limnophila sessiliflora (Vahl) Blume   Ludwigia grandiflora (M. Micheli) Greuter & Burdet   Ludwigia peruviana (L.) Hara   Marsilea quadrifolia L.   Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verde.   Najas minor All.   Nymphoides peltata (Gmel.) O. Kuntze   Sagittaria sagittifolia L.   Salvinia minima Baker   Trapa natans L.

Appendix 5:  Pest  risk  assessment  summaries  for  Cabomba,  Trapa  natans,  and  Nymphoides peltata    Cabomba caroliniana  Summary  The  purpose  of  this  weed  (pest)  risk  assessment  (PRA)  was  to  evaluate  the  plant  health  risk  associated  with  the  aquatic  weed  fanwort  (Cabomba  caroliniana  Gray).  The  Plant  Health  Risk  Assessment  Unit  of  the  Science  Division,  CFIA  has  prepared  this  PRA  at  the  request  of  the  Plant  Health  and  Production  Division,  CFIA.  This  PRA  will  help  the  CFIA  decide  whether  or  not  to  regulate  the  importation  of  fanwort.  A  Weed  Facts  Sheet  is  included. Major points discussed in this risk assessment are summarized below:    Fanwort is an aquatic weed and popular aquarium plant that is considered native to South  America and possibly also the southeastern U.S. It has been introduced in Malaysia, India,  Japan, New Guinea, Australia and England as a result of people discarding or deliberately  planting aquarium plants in natural waterways. It is currently considered an invasive weed  in Australia and Japan, due to its rapid growth and ability to  form dense stands that clog  waterways and squeeze out other vegetation. It is also considered a noxious weed in parts  of the U.S. where its range is spreading.    Fanwort was recently identified in a lake northeast of Peterborough, Ontario, where it has  successfully established and survived winter conditions since at least 1992. This is the only  known population of fanwort to have established in Canada, and is also the furthest north  that  the  plant  has  been  known  to  survive.  For  this  risk  assessment,  the  PRA  area  is  considered to be all of Canada.    Likelihood  of  introduction  is  rated  "HIGH",  based  on  the  fact  that  fanwort  is  regularly  brought into Canada and sold in the aquarium trade, and the fact that in other countries,  this  has  led  to  the  introduction  of  fanwort  in  natural  waterways.  It  is  also  possible  that  fanwort could enter Canada across the border from the U.S., as its U.S. range is approaching  the Canadian border in many eastern states. Viable stem fragments, for example, could get  caught unnoticed on a boat motor in the U.S., and then the boat towed across the border to  a  cottage  on  a  Canadian  lake.  While  it  is  not  clear  how  fanwort  came  to  be  in  Kasshabog  Lake north of Peterborough, its presence there is further confirmation that the likelihood of  introduction is high.    Establishment potential is rated "MEDIUM". Fanwort is certainly capable of surviving and  becoming established in Canada, and based on its presence in Kasshabog Lake, its potential  range includes at least plant hardiness zones 4b, 5, and 6, as well as 7 and 8. These zones  cover the southern `arm' of Ontario and a small piece of southwestern QuÃ©bec, as well as  Nova  Scotia,  southern  Newfoundland,  eastern  New  Brunswick  and  parts  of  British  Columbia. In total, this comprises less than one third of the PRA area (all of Canada) and  earns a "LOW" risk rating. However, in general fanwort appears to be highly adaptable and  has already spread much farther north than would be expected based on descriptions of its  habitat  requirements  in  the  literature.  Its  northern  limits  have  not  yet  been  established,  and it is therefore possible that fanwort could establish in more than one third of Canada. 
141 

 

Natural spread potential is rated "MEDIUM", as fanwort has high reproductive potential but  not highly mobile propagules. Fanwort does not reproduce by seed in the northern parts of  its  range,  but  can  multiply  very  rapidly  by  stem  fragmentation,  either  naturally  or  as  a  result of any activity that cuts up the plants, such as boating, or pulling plants by hand. Any  stem fragment with at least one pair of expanded leaves can grow into a new plant, and it is  by this method that fanwort so quickly infests waterways. Evidence of its invasive nature  can be seen in other countries where it has been introduced, although it is possible it could  behave differently in the cooler climatic conditions of Canada. While fanwort can reproduce  effectively  through  rapid  growth  and  spread  within  connected  waterways,  stem  fragmentation is a less effective means of dispersal between waterways.     Potential  economic  impacts  are  rated  "HIGH".  The  primary  economic  impacts  of  fanwort  infestations would likely be losses of income or decreased property value when water use  is affected in recreational and tourist areas. These could be significant if fanwort were to  spread and infest lakes in Canada as it has in Australia and the U.S. In Ontario, for example,  tourism is the third largest industry and accounts for billions of dollars of annual revenue.  Of  more  significance  from  a  plant  health  perspective  are  potential  threats  to  wild  rice  production  in  Canada.  Wild  rice  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  light  and  resource  availability,  and  could  be  outcompeted  by  fanwort  if  the  two  plants  were  to  occur  in  the  same  water  body.  Fanwort  also  has  the  potential  to  affect  aquaculture,  navigation,  power  generation  and other water uses, and large costs could be incurred in control programs. It should be  noted  that,  while  fanwort's  potential  range  may  be  limited  to  the  more  southern  plant  hardiness zones, it is in these areas that human population density and therefore water use  is  highest.  That  is,  the  parts  of  Canada  where  fanwort  is  certainly  capable  of  becoming  established are also the areas in which there is most potential for economic impact.    Potential environmental impact is rated "HIGH". Fanwort is a serious environmental weed,  and dense infestations can affect water levels, water quality, and nutrient regimes. Fanwort  is  capable  of  displacing  other  aquatic  plants  in  natural  water  bodies,  including  native  species,  and  this  may  also  affect  invertebrate,  fish  and  wildlife  populations.  Sociological  impacts  are  numerous  and  depend  on  the  type  of  waterway  infested.  Fanwort  stands  in  lakes can interfere with commercial and recreational uses, posing a danger to boaters and  swimmers and reducing aesthetic and property values. Fanwort infestations in canals can  affect  irrigation  and  navigation,  and  in  the  U.S.  and  Australia,  fanwort  has  also  caused  serious  problems  in  potable  water  storages,  decreasing  water  quality  and  increasing  the  costs of treatment. The various imperfect control methods available for use on fanwort also  have associated ecological impacts and implications for water quality.    The overall risk associated with fanwort is calculated to be "MEDIUM", which suggests that  specific  phytosanitary  measures  may  be  necessary.  As  a  result  of  this  assessment,  it  is  recommended  that  fanwort  be  added  to  the  list  of  aquatic  weeds  that  are  currently  prohibited  from  Canada  (Elodea  densa,  Hydrilla  verticillata,  Myriophyllum  spp.  and  Trapa  spp.). Initiation and/or support of an eradication program in Kasshabog Lake may also be  appropriate.  Early  control  of  fanwort  is  important,  as  the  longer  infestations  are  left  to  establish and spread, the more difficult they are to eradicate. In general, the importance of  public education and volunteer programs should also be recognized in the management of 
142 

 

aquatic plant invasions. Raising public awareness about invasive aquatic species could be  an important element in reducing spread and the number of new infestations.    In view of the significant environmental impacts caused by fanwort, and its designation as  an  invasive  species,  as  well  as  other  implications  for  aquatic  systems  and  waterbased  industries, it is recommended that other government departments should be made aware  of this issue (such as, but not limited to: Environment Canada, Department of Fisheries and  Oceans,  Industry  Canada,  and  provincial  industry,  tourism  and  natural  resource  departments).  Collaboration  on  issues  such  as  this  could  maximize  resources  and  effectiveness, while minimizing duplication of efforts.    Trapa natans  Summary    The  purpose  of  this  pest  risk  assessment  (PRA)  was  to  evaluate  the  plant  health  risk  associated  with  the  European  waterchestnut  (Trapa  natans  L.).  The  Plant  Health  Risk  Assessment Unit of the Science Division, CFIA has prepared this PRA at the request of the  Plant Health and Production Division, CFIA. This PRA will help the CFIA decide whether or  not  to  continue  to  regulate  the  importation  of  European  waterchestnut.  A  Weed  Facts  Sheet is included. Major points discussed in this document are summarized below:    Waterchestnut is a floatingleaved aquatic plant that is considered native to Europe, Asia,  and Africa. It has a long history of being cultivated for its nuts, particularly in Asia where  they are still an important food. Waterchestnut is listed as a strictly protected species in  the  Bern  Convention  (Council  of  Europe)  due  to  the  disappearance  of  populations  from  some parts of its native European range. By contrast, it is considered an invasive species in  its introduced range in the northeastern US, where its rapid growth creates dense stands  that  clog  waterways  and  squeeze  out  other  vegetation.  It  has  been  the  subject  of  control  and eradication programs in the US since the 1920s. It is currently reported from up to 11  northeastern states.    For  this  risk  assessment,  the  PRA  area  is  considered  to  be  all  of  Canada.  Waterchestnut  was recently identified in RiviÃ¨re du Sud in southwestern QuÃ©bec, where it has survived  winter conditions and continues to spread. This is the first reported occurrence of water chestnut  in  Canada,  and  it  also  represents  a  northward  expansion  of  the  plant's  range  in  North America.    Likelihood of introduction is rated "HIGH". Factors that are favourable for the introduction  of  water  chestnut  into  Canada  include:  1)  The  presence  of  waterchestnut  infestations  in  the northeastern US, 2) the number of watersheds that straddle the CanadaUS border, 3)  the  constant  movement  of  people  and  vehicles  across  the  CanadaUS  border,  and  4)  the  plant's ability to spread both within and between watersheds due to the natural expansion  of existing populations, and the dispersal of seeds by way of water currents, birds, animals,  and  human  activities.  The  presence  of  waterchestnut  in  RiviÃ¨re  du  Sud  confirms  that  at  least one of these pathways is effective.

Establishment  potential  is  rated  "HIGH".  Waterchestnut  is  certainly  capable  of  surviving  and  becoming  established  in  Canada  and  based  on  its  presence  in  RiviÃ¨re  du  Sud  its  potential  range  includes  at  least  plant  hardiness  zones  5  and  6.  These  zones  cover  the  southern `arm' of Ontario, and a small piece of southwestern QuÃ©bec, as well as all of Nova  Scotia,  southern  Newfoundland,  eastern  New  Brunswick  and  parts  of  BC  In  total,  this  comprises less than one third of the PRA area (all of Canada) and earns a "LOW" risk rating.  However,  it  is  possible  that  waterchestnut  could  continue  to  spread  northwards,  and  populations in northeastern China and eastern Russia suggest that it may also be able to  survive  zones  1,  2,  3,  and  4,  and  possibly  0b.  This  range  covers  a  much  larger  portion  of  central and northern Canada, including all but the most extreme arctic areas.    Natural  spread  potential  is  rated  "MEDIUM".  Waterchestnut  behaves  as  a  true  annual  in  North America and overwinters by seed. At the beginning of each growing season, plants  use clonal propagation to rapidly colonize new areas and cover the water surface with leafy  rosettes.  These  rosettes  produce  large  numbers  of  seeds  that  drop  to  the  substrate  and  overwinter. A portion will germinate the following spring, and a portion will remain in the  seed bank. It is estimated that a single plant can produce up to 300 seeds a year, and seeds  can remain viable for up to 12 years. Seeds can be dispersed locally by water currents, or  regionally  by  birds  and  animals.  As  illustrated  by  its  behaviour  in  the  US,  waterchestnut  has  effective  means  of  vegetative  spread,  seed  reproduction,  and  both  local  and  regional  dispersal. Human activity is an additional factor not included in the risk rating, as seeds can  "hitchhike" on boats and fishing gear.    Potential  economic  impacts  are  rated  "HIGH".  The  primary  economic  impacts  of  water chestnut  would  likely  be  loss  of  income  or  decreased  property  value  when  water  use  is  affected in recreational or tourist areas, and costs of control. These could be significant if  waterchestnut were to spread and infest lakes in Canada as it has in the US In Ontario, for  example, tourism is the third largest industry and accounts for billions of dollars of annual  revenue. Of more significance from a plant health perspective are potential threats to wild  rice production in Canada. Two varieties of wild rice could be lost if water chestnut were to  become established throughout the Richelieu River watershed, with long term implications  for  crop  development  and  production.  Waterchestnut  also  has  the  potential  to  affect  aquaculture,  navigation,  power  generation  and  other  water  uses.  It  should  be  noted  that,  even if water chestnut's range in Canada were to be limited to plant hardiness zones 5 and  6, it is in these areas that population density and therefore water use is the highest. That is,  the parts of Canada where water chestnut is certainly capable of becoming established are  also the areas in which there is most potential for economic impact.    Potential environmental impact is rated "HIGH". Waterchestnut is a serious environmental  weed,  and  dense  infestations  can  cause  rapid  sedimentation  and  water  pollution.  It  is  a  highly  competitive  plant,  and  tends  to  shade  out  and  displace  other  aquatic  plants  in  natural water bodies, including native species. The effects of this on invertebrate, fish and  wildlife population require further study, but a reduction in plant biodiversity in an aquatic  system  will  certainly  have  impacts  throughout  the  food  chain.  Sociological  impacts  are  numerous  and  depend  on  the  type  of  waterway  infested.  Waterchestnut  stands  in  lakes  can  interfere  with  commercial  and  recreational  uses,  posing  a  danger  to  boaters  and 
144 

 

swimmers and reducing aesthetic and property value. Infestations in rivers and canals can  affect navigation, and waterchestnut can also cause pollution problems in reservoirs and  other sources of drinking water. The various imperfect control methods available also have  associated ecological implications.    The overall risk associated with waterchestnut is calculated to be "HIGH", which indicates  that  specific  phytosanitary  measures  are  strongly  recommended.  As  a  result  of  this  assessment, it is recommended that waterchestnut remain on the list of aquatic weeds that  are currently prohibited from Canada. Support of the control program currently underway  in RiviÃ¨re du Sud may also be appropriate. Early control of waterchestnut is important, as  the  longer  infestations  are  left  to  establish  and  spread,  the  more  difficult  they  are  to  eradicate.  In  general,  the  importance  of  public  education  and  volunteer  programs  should  also be recognized in the management of aquatic plant invasions. Raising public awareness  about invasive aquatic species could be an important element in reducing spread and the  number  of  new  infestations.  Waterchestnut  in  the  US  provides  examples  of  volunteers  working successfully to remove plants and control infestations in recreational areas.    In  view  of  the  significant  environmental  impacts  caused  by  waterchestnut,  and  its  designation  as  an  invasive  species,  as  well  as  other  implications  for  aquatic  systems  and  waterbased industries, it is recommended that other government departments should be  made aware of this issue (such as, but not limited to: Environment Canada, Department of  Fisheries  and  Oceans,  Industry  Canada,  and  provincial  industry,  tourism  and  natural  resource departments). Collaboration on issues such as this could maximize resources and  effectiveness, while minimizing duplication of efforts.    Nymphoides peltata  Summary    The  purpose  of  this  weed  risk  assessment  (WRA)  was  to  evaluate  the  plant  health  risk  associated with  Nymphoides  peltata (S. G. Gmel.) Kuntze (yellow floating heart). The Plant  Health Risk Assessment Unit of the Science Advice Division, CFIA has prepared this WRA at  the  request  of  the  Environment  and  Biodiversity  Science  Section  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada.  This  WRA  will  help  risk  managers  develop  an  appropriate  action  plan  regarding  yellow floating heart. A weed fact sheet is included.     Yellow  floating  heart  is  a  rooted  aquatic  perennial  herb  of  the  buckbean  family  (Menyanthaceae), native to Eurasia and currently present in North America in several U.S.  states,  including  in  New  England,  where  it  is  considered  invasive.  A  population  has  been  present  in  Canada,  in  the  two  ponds  of  Brown's  Inlet,  Ottawa,  ON,  for  some  years.  High  densities  of  the  plant  have  recently  prompted  concern  from  the  local  residents  and  from  Parks Canada, and some control efforts have been attempted. New reports of populations  in  Nova  Scotia  and  Newfoundland  have  also  raised  concern  that  the  species  may  be  spreading.    Probability of entry is rated "HIGH" as the most likely pathway for introduction into Canada  is  the  intentional  importation  of  plants  for  planting.  Yellow  floating  heart  is  an  attractive  ornamental plant that is commonly sold for planting in aquaria and water gardens. It can be 
145 

 

imported and sold in Canada without restrictions, and is already known to have naturalized  outside of cultivation at one site in NF and several sites in NS, ON, QC and BC. All sites are  thought to be the result of escape from deliberate plantings or aquarium dumping.    Probability  of  establishment  is  rated  "HIGH".  Yellow  floating  heart  grows  in  still  or  slow  moving  water  in  rivers,  lakes,  reservoirs,  ditches,  ponds  and  swamps,  primarily  in  eutrophic,  alkaline  backwaters  12  m  deep.  It  is  already  known  to  be  established  at  a  number of sites in Canada. Based on the distribution of these sites, it is able to survive in at  least  plant  hardiness  zones  84.  In  Europe,  the  northern  climatic  limit  of  the  species  is  roughly delineated by the 16C July isotherm. In Canada, this suggests an area that includes  a larger portion of the country, up to and including plant hardiness zone 1.    Probability  of  spread  is  rated  "MEDIUM".  Yellow  floating  heart  can  reproduce  both  vegetatively  and  by  seed.  Natural  dispersal  is  primarily  by  water  currents.  Flowers  are  distylous, and there are indications of a weak incompatibility system limiting self and intra morph fertilization. In North America, only one flower morph is known to be present, and it  is  speculated  that  reproduction  here  is  largely  vegetative.  Large  numbers  of  seeds  are  produced  but  survivorship  of  seedlings  is  unknown.  Overall,  natural  spread  in  North  America  to  date  has  been  relatively  slow.  Introduction  of  the  other  flower  morph  in  conditions  that  allow  crosspollination  could  change  this.  Currently  in  North  America,  deliberate  movements  by  humans  together  with  escape  from  cultivation  are  the  most  important factors in the longdistance dispersal of yellow floating heart.      Potential economic consequences are rated "MEDIUM". Yellow floating heart does not have  direct  economic  effects  on  agriculture  or  forestry,  but  does  have  the  potential  to  cause  significant  economic  losses  to  waterbased  industries  such  as  tourism  (by  impeding  the  recreational use of water bodies), aquaculture, and power generation. Costs of controlling  yellow floating heart are likely to be locally significant, particularly where a combination of  methods needs to be applied, and/or where infestations require repeated treatment over  time. Once established, aquatic weeds are notoriously difficult to control.     Potential  environmental  and  social  consequences  are  rated  "HIGH".  Yellow  floating  heart  can  grow  rapidly  and  form  dense  populations  in  water  bodies,  with  a  continuous  surface  canopy  of  leaves  that  reduce  water  flow  and  light  penetration,  lower  oxygen  levels,  and  alter  nutrient  cycling.  Yellow  floating  heart  can  also  compete  with  and  exclude  native  aquatic  vegetation,  reducing  biodiversity,  altering  water  quality  and  affecting  faunal  communities.  Potential  indirect  effects  include  the  environmental  impacts  of  associated  control measures (manual, mechanical, chemical) as well as the social impacts on tourism  and recreation, property values, and waterbased industries such as aquaculture, discussed  above.      Overall, there is relatively little uncertainty involved in assessing the risk of yellow floating  heart. The probability of entry and establishment in Canada is known, as the plant is sold  through  the  aquatic  plant  nursery  trade  and  has  already  been  introduced  and  occurs  in  several  locations. There  is  some  uncertainty  about  the  exact  extent  of  its  potential  range,  but in any case it is known to survive in five provinces, and several plant hardiness zones. 
146 

 

Potential spread involves a bit more uncertainty, as it is not known why spread has been  relatively slow in North America to date. North American data on seed production, seedling  viability, and relative contributions of sexual versus vegetative reproduction in expanding  populations, would all be helpful. If spread is in fact being limited by the presence of only  one flower morph, additional effort could be focused on excluding the other flower morph  from  Canada.  Field  research  on  existing  populations  in  Canada  would  be  helpful  in  answering some of these questions.    A  greater  degree  of  uncertainty  exists  in  predicting  the  consequences  of  yellow  floating  heart  introduction,  as  they  are  not  described  or  quantified  in  any  detail  in  the  literature.  Economic consequences can be predicted based on information from other, similar aquatic  plant  infestations,  and  their  magnitude  will  depend  on  the  particular  water  bodies  and  industries  affected,  and  the  extent  of  control  efforts  applied.  Likewise,  environmental  consequences can be easily predicted in a general sense (e.g., will affect water quality, will  exclude  native  species),  but  are  not  described  in  any  detail  (e.g.,  how  will  it  affect  water  quality,  what  species  will  be  excluded).  These  too,  will  vary  from  site  to  site  and  will  depend largely on where the plant becomes established. Overall, it is fairly certain that the  impacts will occur, but less certain exactly how they might manifest themselves in Canada.    The  overall  risk  associated  with  yellow  floating  heart  is  calculated  to  be  "HIGH",  which  suggests  that  specific  phytosanitary  measures  may  be  necessary.  As  a  result  of  this  assessment,  it  is  recommended  that  the  importation  and  sale  of  yellow  floating  heart  in  Canada  be  prohibited.  Initiation  and/or  support  of  eradication  programs  for  the  small  number  of  known  sites  may  also  be  appropriate.  Early  control  of  yellow  floating  heart  is  important, as the longer the infestations are left to establish and spread, the more difficult  they  will  be  to  eradicate.  In  general,  the  importance  of  public  education  and  volunteer  programs should also be recognized in the management of aquatic plant invasions. Raising  public awareness about invasive aquatic species could be an important element in reducing  spread and the number of new infestations.
