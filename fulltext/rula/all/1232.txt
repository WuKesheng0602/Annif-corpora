PURE-CULTURE AND MIXED COMMUNITY BIOFILM RESPONSES TO CARBONSTARVATION AND UV-C EXPOSURE

By: C Alexia Lane, BSc. (Hons) Master of Applied Science, Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University 2011

Biofilms are known to contribute to disease through inherent protective mechanisms and propagation strategies. These multi-cellular systems also play essential roles in numerous environmental processes. The current study investigated the responses of a mixed community biofilm to carbon-starvation, and measured the effects of UV-C on pure-culture biofilms at different stages of maturity by monitoring metabolic and cell yield responses. Carbon dioxide production and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield were used as the measurement parameters. The mixed community rapidly responded to induced carbon-starvation under continuous flow conditions by remaining metabolically inactive throughout the 96 and 120 h starvation periods, only to promptly return to a metabolically active state upon the reintroduction of carbon. The effects of UV-C on pure-culture biofilms was negligible, with no log activation being achieved, and metabolic activity remaining static. iii

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Background
Biofilms are generically defined as naturally-occurring heterogeneous microbial communities that adhere to biotic and abiotic surfaces in a wide variety of environments by the secretion of a protective chemical matrix that allows the community to better withstand natural or induced environmental pressures (Costerton et al., 1999; Donlan, 2002). It has been estimated that 80% of the global microbial biomass exists in biofilms (Richards & Melander, 2009a) demonstrating that it is advantageous for bacterial survival to form biofilms. Examples of surfaces where biofilms are found include, but are not limited to human teeth, rocks submerged in rivers (Costerton et al., 1978), in-dwelling medical devices (Costerton et al., 2003), drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) (LeChevallier et al., 1987) as well as both natural and synthetic materials above or below ground (Sauer et al., 2007). The self-synthesized chemical matrix is composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which are primarily comprised of proteins and polysaccharides, but also includes nucleic acids, lipids and phospholipids (Simões et al., 2010). The EPS also serves as a protective barrier or shield against antimicrobials while allowing the biofilm to mature within a semi-enclosed environment (Sauer et al., 2007). It is recognized that biofilms allow bacteria to survive the action of various antimicrobials and / or stressors including antibiotics, desiccation, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (Gaddy & Actis, 2009), affording resident microorganisms up to 1500 times more resistance to antimicrobials than their planktonic counterparts. Further, the structural organization within a multi-species biofilm permits the mineralization of a wider range of substrates, which the individual members may not be capable of utilizing as discrete entities (Wolfaardt et al., 1994). Biofilms are comprised of both sessile and planktonic cells that have been proven to possess profoundly different phenotypes (Costerton et al., 2003) and metabolic activity (Richards & Melander, 2009a). Sessile cells are those attached to a surface whereas planktonic cells are free-floating in the surrounding environment. The term biofilm encompasses single-species, multi-species or multi-kingdom communities, all of which are heterogeneous because of the presence of more than one species or as a result of different gene expression amongst the same species (Jefferson, 2004; Sauer et al., 2007). Further, according to Donlan (2002), each microbial community or biofilm is considered unique. 1

Pathogens may exist within the biofilm matrix where they are protected from the effects of antimicrobials. Antimicrobials often fail to reach these protected pathogens whereby propagation and subsequent infection become real possibilities. With antimicrobial resistance being a characteristic of biofilms, a judicious selection of an antimicrobial regime is necessary to reduce biofilm growth. As such, the aim of this study was to investigate the fundamental responses of an environmentally-relevant mixed community biofilm to dual stressors with the ultimate goal of deterring biofilm growth. Due to the pervasive nature of biofilms and the negative impact imposed on public health and industry, biofilms have been the impetus driving many research initiatives throughout the past three decades. The intent has been to elucidate biofilm characteristics and mechanisms in order to ultimately control their growth and proliferation in undesirable locations. Challenges associated with biofilm persistence in certain environments such as hospitals, clinics, food preparation sites, drinking water distribution systems, ecological and agricultural environments give rise to economic, environmental and public health ramifications (Donlan, 2002). For the current study a mixed community biofilm isolated from a high traffic washroom sink-drain was examined for its metabolic and cell yield responses to carbon- starvation, in addition to the responses of pure-culture biofilms to UV exposure. Although the scope of this study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the effect of nutrient deprivation and antimicrobial treatment on biofilms as strategies to control their formation in undesirable locations, it is important to acknowledge that biofilms are vital to life on earth. Biofilms form the base of the aquatic food-web and are active participants in biogeochemical cycling (Allan & Castillo, 2007). Additionally, biofilms have an integral role in biosand filtration which allows point of use water treatment in locations not served by piped, treated drinking water (Kubare & Haarhoff, 2010). Furthermore, several biofilm-forming microorganisms have been used to degrade petroleum in soil caused by spills, and have been successfully employed as biofungicides on crops (Morikawa, 2006). As asserted by Richards & Melander (2009a) biofilms surely symbolize evolutionary advancement against extreme environmental stresses. To date no study has examined the response of an environmentally-relevant mixed community biofilm to nutrient starvation followed by UV irradiation.

1.2 Study Objectives and Hypothesis
The metabolic, architectural, and planktonic cell yield responses of pure-culture biofilms to carbon deplete and replete conditions were presented by Bester et al. (2011). A principle finding from their study was that biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield is a means of microbial propagation; this knowledge in part served as platform of the current study which applied this response measurement to pure-culture biofilm and environmentally-relevant mixed community biofilms that experienced carbon-starvation through the removal and reintroduction of carbon into the media, and to pure-culture biofilms that underwent carbon-starvation and UV exposure. It was hypothesized that under laminar flow, the mixed community biofilm constructed from a sink-drain sample, when subjected to carbon-starvation would exhibit reductions in metabolism and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield as measured by carbon dioxide production and effluent counts, respectively. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp, pure-culture biofilms were expected to be completely inactivated by UV, as measured by the same parameters. In order to achieve the overall aim in this study, several objectives were devised:    Characterization of an environmentally-relevant mixed community using molecular techniques. Determination of mixed community biofilm responses to carbon-starvation by measuring metabolic and cell yield responses. Evaluation of the effect of UV-C to colonies, planktonic cells, pure­culture biofilms using bench-top and continuous flow system experiments.

Chapter 2: Literature Review
2.1 Biofilm Formation and Attachment
Attachment of cells to a surface is deemed critical in biofilm formation as the interaction between the surface and adherent bacterial cells establishes the foundation for subsequent biofilm-associated cells (Stoodley et al., 2002; Palmer et al., 2007). A commonly accepted 5stage theory of biofilm development was presented by Stoodley et al. (2002) that has been well studied and confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). The first stage is referred to as reversible attachment. In this stage, cells come into contact with a surface and begin to exude EPS. Some cells are still capable of pilus-mediated twitching or gliding, hence being referred to as reversible attachment. Of note is that during the initial stage Brownian motion is in effect whereby the microorganisms can still be easily removed by fluid shear forces, such as rinsing (Palmer et al., 2007). The second stage is referred to as irreversible attachment due to the increase in the number of cells resulting in elevated amounts of EPS being secreted causing the cells to adhere to the surface; upon completion of the second, irreversible step, microorganisms are substantially more difficult to remove from the surface requiring vigorous removal actions such as scrubbing or chemical cleaners. The third stage depicts a change in the overall morphology and topography of the biofilm whereby it becomes a three dimensional (3D) structure. The distinct shape of the biofilm results in increased surface area to maximize nutrient absorption and waste expulsion. Upon maturation, hollow cavities can be seen throughout the biofilm which act as the necessary water, nutrient and waste transport system within the microbial community. The fourth stage is characterized by a continued increase in biofilm complexity coupled with preparation for the release of biofilm cells. Finally the fifth stage results in the detachment of cells from the biofilm. These detached cells are referred to as planktonic revertants, which then move to different locations, ultimately attaching to a suitable surface and repeating the cycle (Richards & Melander, 2009a; Simões et al., 2010). As biofilms house the majority of the worlds microbiological communities (Richards & Melander, 2009a) it is easy to understand how bacteria are so successful and difficult to control. The model Stoodley et al. (2002) presented is essentially a linear process. Conversely by monitoring cell yield in effluent from biofilms it has been shown that detachment and release

4

of planktonic revertants is a continuous process throughout biofilm development (Bester et al., 2009). 2.1.1 Factors Affecting Attachment and Biofilm Formation The initial attachment of planktonic cells to surfaces is dependent on a number of factors pertinent to the adhesion surface, bulk fluid and the cells themselves (Donlan, 2002; Simões et al., 2010). Some of the factors identified by Donlan (2002) and Simões et al. (2010) were surface texture, hydrophobicity, conditioning films, charge of the surface and cell, cellular appendages, the EPS, cell-signalling, and gene expression. As a rule, attachment of microorganisms to surfaces more readily occurs when the surface is rougher, more hydrophobic and coated by surface conditioning films (LeChevallier et al., 1987; Donlan, 2002; Teixeira et al., 2005; Verran & Whitehead, 2005). Conditioning films occur naturally on surfaces as a result of the deposition of organic molecules or polymers from the surrounding environment, whereupon microbial attachment is encouraged, ensued by biofilm formation (Donlan, 2002). Conditioning films derived from humans originate from blood, tears, saliva, or respiratory secretions. Most bacterial cell surfaces have a net negative charge which keeps them at a short distance from surfaces as a result of electrostatic repulsive forces (Palmer et al., 2007). This can be overcome by hydrophobicity between the cell and attachment surfaces and by extracellular appendages, namely fimbriae or pili, and flagella (Shi & Zhu, 2009; Simões et al., 2010). Of note is that not all cells have fimbriae or flagella. Recall that in the first stages of attachment some cells are still capable of pilus-mediated movement, providing further evidence of the involvement of cellular appendages in the initial stages of attachment. The role of the EPS in biofilm attachment is integral to the success of bacterial surface colonization in natural environments (Costerton et al., 1978). Attachment of microorganisms to a surface stimulates the synthesis of the EPS (Brooks & Flint, 2008). The EPS facilitates the adhesion and cohesion of the biofilm by binding cells and other particulate materials together as well as binding the cells to the surface (Simões et al., 2010). Of note, is that the EPS is negatively charged which certainly contributes to the antimicrobial resistance of biofilms,

5

whereby positively charged antimicrobials are bound by the EPS rarely reaching the biofilm core (Lewis, 2007). Quorum sensing (otherwise known as cell-to-cell signalling or bacterial communication) has been identified as an important factor in biofilm formation as well as throughout the biofilm lifecycle (Williams et al., 2007). It is generally described as the phenomenon whereby bacteria communicate amongst themselves by the release of signal molecules into the EPS resulting in a change in bacterial behaviour. As the biofilm grows, increased numbers of signalling molecules are released into the surrounding EPS resulting in an accumulation of these molecules whereby the bacteria are alerted to their increased population density which in turn, elicits a response (Stanley & Lazazzera, 2004; Williams et al., 2007). As suggested by Telgmann et al. (2004) the accumulation of signalling molecules is likely a trigger for cell detachment from the biofilm.

2.2 Biofilm Detachment
Similar to biofilm attachment processes, detachment of biofilms (i.e. stage 5) is affected by various physical, chemical and biological factors. Some factors are the presence of matrixdegradation enzymes, gas bubbles produced inherently by microbes, nutrient levels, shear stress, quorum sensing molecules, degradation of the EPS and carbon-starvation (Hunt et al., 2004; McLandsborough et al., 2006; Bester et al., 2009). Of note is that examining biofilm detachment mechanisms and processes is still in the early stages when compared to studies of biofilm attachment and formation (Garny et al., 2008). To this point, the current study strives to augment the knowledge gained by Bester et al. (2011) who examined a pure-culture biofilms detachment response to carbon-starvation, by investigating detachment responses of a mixed community biofilm to carbon-starvation. Garny et al. (2008) described four methods of biofilm detachment that may occur simultaneously: erosion, abrasion, sloughing and predator grazing. Erosion results from fluid shear force and abrasion is the collision of particles; both processes refer to the continuous detachment of cells from the overall surface of the biofilm. Sloughing, on the other hand, is the immediate loss of large aggregates which affects the entire biofilm, potentially resulting in entire biofilm loss. Lastly, predator grazing is eukaryotes grazing on the biofilm rendering it weakened or disrupted. Telgmann et al. (2004) differentiated erosion from sloughing according to particle size whereby smaller particles are defined to have undergone erosion, and larger pieces of biomass - sloughing. Further, both erosion and sloughing contribute to biofilm 6

detachment with erosion having a greater influence on overall removal, and sloughing having a greater influence on biofilm morphology (Telgmann et al., 2004). Contrary to the previously accepted notion of biofilm cell detachment occurring once the biofilm reached maturation, a recent study by Bester et al. (2009) found that cells detached throughout the biofilm maturation process, with cells being shown to detach within 6 h of surface attachment by a pure-culture Pseudomonas sp. biofilm. This release of cells from the maturing biofilm is termed planktonic cell yield (Bester et al., 2011). Undoubtedly, this will shift the focus of studies examining detachment of biofilm cells and subsequent re-colonization elsewhere. The fact that biofilm cell detachment occurs throughout the biofilm maturation process serves as a basis for continued work by Bester and is a measurement parameter in the current study. By monitoring planktonic cell yield using effluent counts it can be determined when the biofilm reaches a semi steady-state, indicating that the biofilm is starting to mature. Steady-state information was to be used as the baseline in the current study to signal when starve the biofilm by removing carbon from the media.

2.3 Biofilms in Aquatic Environments
As noted by Costerton et al. (1978) in early biofilm literature, foundational biofilm experiments were carried out in lotic and lentic environments with further exploratory studies originating within the dental industry. In lotic systems, it was determined that in order to survive in dynamic environmental conditions, microbes converged into aggregates whereupon a network of polysaccharides is secreted to afford the community protection, ensure its adherence and provide structural support. Because of the origin of these experiments, laboratory studies have often strived to mimic these solid-liquid interfaces in order to gain further knowledge on fundamental biofilm properties. As such, much of the biofilm information available in the literature has been put forward from studies at solid-liquid interfaces. The current study adheres to this tendency with the intention of future application of the knowledge gained to solid-air interface models. When considering biofilms in aquatic environments, especially in lentic systems, it is important to recognize that lentic systems are often classified in terms of nutrient levels i.e. oligotrophic (low nutrients), or eutrophic (excess nutrients). The indigenous microbial populations are certainly affected by the nutrient content, which has been known to alter the 7

bacterial community profile over time (Christian & Lind, 2007). Of interest to the current study was biofilm response to nutrient starvation. Costerton (1995) asserted that bacteria in oligotrophic environments coalesce into biofilms in order to localize any available nutrients, in addition to their seeming capability of entering quiescence until such time that nutrients once again become available. 2.3.1 Drinking Water Distribution Systems (DWDS) DWDS encompass a large network of infrastructure, with treatment facilities delivering safe, clean drinking water to the public via an extensive piping network (Bauman et al., 2009). DWDS are colonized by microorganisms which are ubiquitous in water environments and do not pose a public health threat or compromise DWDS integrity when in a planktonic state. However, when these microorganisms are associated with biofilms, problems arise (Bauman et al., 2009). Biofilms in DWDS have long been recognized as problematic in two main ways: biofouling (Flemming, 2002) and microbial contamination of drinking water (LeChevallier et al., 1987; Flemming, 1993; Bauman et al., 2009). In order to counteract the adverse effects of biofilms in DWDS control measures are implemented at several stages of water treatment and distribution. However, one must simultaneously consider the effects of such controls from both a public health and DWDS engineering integrity stance. Both sides aim to remove the attached masses, but dispersal of the biofilm as desired from an engineering standpoint can result in a public health risk, as pathogens trapped within the biofilm are released into the water supply, making biofilm control within these environments complicated (Bauman et al., 2009). The term ,,biofouling was first introduced by Epstein in 1981, as a specification of the term ,,fouling. Biofouling in general describes the unwanted growth of biofilms on surfaces (Flemming, 2002). Flemming (2002) asserted that biofouling is the direct manifestation of biofilms in water systems. Two distinct environmental problems resulting from biofouling are the need for increased energy consumption to overcome the reduced flow rates in narrowed water transportation pipelines, and the need to alter wastewater treatment regimes to counteract the adverse effects of increased toxic biocide application to control biofilms (Flemming, 1993). Further substantiation of the problems caused by biofouling is presented by Cloete et al. (1992) in their extensive review of topics related to biofouling in water systems; biofouling is moreover

8

further reduced to core issues, namely the physical obstructions in DWDS and microbial induced corrosion (MIC). Given that biofilms are multi-layered growth forms characterized by three-dimensional structure (Stoodley et al., 2002), it is logical that biofilms could result in physical obstructions by the narrowing of pipelines. This phenomenon occurs regardless of the microbial consortia within the biofilm, and has been detected throughout DWDS (LeChevallier et al., 1987). In effect the decreased diameter of the pipelines increases the friction resistance while consuming the kinetic energy of water, quite simply leading to increased energy demand which is naturally coupled with increased cost (Flemming, 1993). Briefly, MIC occurs because the biofilm creates a specialized microenvironment with the necessary parameters for the electrochemical reactions to occur. MIC results in compromised DWDS structural integrity and causes acidification of the surrounding environment (Cloete et al., 1992). Organisms associated with MIC include sulphatereducing bacteria, iron - and manganese-oxidizing bacteria and acid forming microorganisms (Cloete et al., 1992; Flemming, 1993). Of note is that none of aforementioned MIC-associated microbes have been selected for the present study because of their specific substrate requirements. Microbial contamination of water may aesthetically degrade water quality rendering it unpleasant to drink or smell, or it may cause injurious health effects (Block, 1992). Several disruptions, including changes in nutrient concentration and shear force inherent within DWDS were proposed to cause water contamination by releasing cells from the biofilms (Flemming, 2002). Block (1992) also named shear force as a mechanism by which water quality is degraded within DWDS. Microbial contamination becomes a health concern when the released microorganisms are pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. In order to prevent disease or in more extreme instances death, DWDS have a continuous level of disinfectant or biocide present throughout the system (Block, 1992). Achieving disinfection in DWDS is complicated due to the numerous microenvironments that arise from the heterogeneous system, in addition to the microbial diversity existing within biofilms in these environments (Block, 1992; Simões et al., 2010). Some common bacterial genera in DWDS are Bacillus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Sphingomonas and Acinetobacter (Simões et al., 2010).Regardless of the inherent complications, 9

ensuring proper disinfection is imperative to safeguarding public health and safety. Disinfection using chlorine in DWDS was implemented at the turn of the twentieth century and unequivocally remains the most widely used disinfectant in DWDS (Bachmann & Edyvean, 2005). The purpose of disinfection is to reduce the total number of bacteria in bulk water (Bachmann & Edyvean, 2005); however, this does not adequately address the need to control biofilms in DWDS which house an estimated 95% of microbial biomass in biofilms, predominantly attached to pipe surfaces (Simões et al., 2010). Again, what must be taken into account when considering biocide application is the shield against antimicrobials that the biofilm affords to its resident opportunistic pathogens. As such, a variety of biocides with varying mechanisms, target specificity, and dosage requirements are needed to ensure adequate disinfection and compliance with water quality guidelines or standards (Cloete et al., 1992). Of note is that certain biocides are known to cause toxic by-products that result in deleterious effects in aquatic ecosystems and may result in the formation of carcinogenic compounds (Harris et al., 1987; Cloete et al., 1992). Within this vast infrastructure network there are biofilms present at both solid-liquid and solid-air interfaces. Further, a dynamic environment of wet and dry periods, nutrient deprivation, and disinfection exist, promoting diverse bacterial colonization. To this point, it is important to consider that the terminus of DWDS is sink-drains - which support biofilms rich in diversity and density. These outlets are subject to all the aforementioned conditions; therefore, a community modelled after a sink-drain was used in the current study knowing that its members are able to survive at solid-liquid and solid-air interfaces, under highly variable conditions.

2.4 Biofilms at Solid-Air interfaces
Biofilms at solid-air interfaces constitutes a broad range of potential surfaces in hospital, clinical and food preparation settings. Some examples of these surfaces include floors, sinks, counter/table tops, curtains, beds, medical devices and food processing equipment. Several studies have been carried out in these various environments to characterize and enumerate these biofilms, often with the aim of determining pathogen load in order to relate the biofilms to nosocomial and other infections and / or food spoilage (Roberts et al., 2008; Zorman & Jersek, 2008). Understandably, there are several parameters affecting the growth and presence of biofilms in these settings including the ventilation system, cleaning methods, location of the ward i.e. intensive care units (ICU) versus surgery ward and age of the buildings, equipment and 10

construction materials. Biofilms at solid-air interfaces also dominate in the natural environment, such as those found on rocks or soil particles. 2.4.1 Hospital and Clinical Settings In the attempt to identify pathogen reservoirs in settings housing known immunocompromised individuals, exhaustive inventories of possible pathogen attachment sites are carried out. The comparison of surface building materials for their bacterial attachment affinity was investigated, showing that vinyl flooring is superior to ceramic tile with regards to reducing bacterial colonization, and stainless steel was proven to be the best materials for counter/bench tops (Yazgi et al., 2009). When examining a newly added hospital ward to an existing structure it was proven that the changes and establishment of bacteria are closely associated with human presence (Klánová & Hollerová, 2003; Narui et al., 2009). By carrying out an overall bacterial surveillance of both structures (new and old), it was determined that isolates taken from floors, sinks and air changed with the transfer of patients and staff, implying that the movement of people within these environments directly affected the resident bacterial populations in health care facilities. Of note is that biofilms at solid-air interfaces can also include the growth of biofilms on medical equipment. As asserted by Richards & Melander (2009b) infections caused by biofilms growing on in-dwelling medical devices (IMD) pose serious health and financial consequences to the patients and health care industry. Essentially once a biofilm has colonized an IMD the only treatment is its removal; this is both costly and only a short-term solution as another IMD must be inserted. As a result, there has been much research into coating the IMDs with antimicrobial agents to prevent biofilm attachment, again possibly only a short-term solution as the microorganisms may adapt and develop resistance to the antimicrobial coating agents (Bak et al., 2009; Richards & Melander, 2009b). As research in this field advances studies are becoming increasingly specific. For instance, Alfa & Howie (2009) examined build-up biofilms on flexible repeat use endoscopes and determined that the biofilms contain a wide variety of microorganisms despite rigorous cleaning regimes.

11

2.4.2 Food Processing Settings Biofilms in the food industry including food preparation, and processing sites are a public health concern as they are known reservoirs for both food-spoilage and pathogenic bacteria (Brooks & Flint, 2008; Shi & Zhu, 2009). Of noted concern to the food industry is that biofilms are becoming increasingly difficult to control and eradicate with current disinfection procedures and technology. This is resulting in much research into new control mechanisms, and control products to ensure compliance with food safety guidelines (Brooks & Flint, 2008). Several biofilm detection and monitoring methods have been tested in laboratory settings; however, as Brooks & Flint (2008) point out there is a gap between the laboratory testing and the practical application for monitoring biofilms on-site in actual industry settings. Biofilm formation in the food industry is succinctly explained by Shi & Zhu (2009) as having four basic steps. Organic molecules from a food source are deposited onto the surface resulting in a conditioned surface whereupon microorganisms are attracted to this conditioned surface. Following cleaning and sanitizing, some cells remain that will then initiate growth of the biofilm that is able to expand by gene expression and quorum sensing. Of note is that substratum properties and surrounding environmental factors also affect biofilm formation (Shi & Zhu, 2009). A unique feature of biofilm initiation and formation in the food industry is that often proteins and fats derived from improperly cleaned or sanitized equipment are present on surfaces that provide nutrients and water encouraging biofilm growth (McLandsborough et al., 2006). Several bacterial pathogens and food spoilage organisms have been identified in the food industry. Interestingly some of these pathogens are the same as pathogens identified in hospital studies; however, some are different. Known bacterial pathogens include members of the genera: Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Campylobacter, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Listeria, Bacillus, and Vibrio (Teixeira et al., 2005; McLandsborough et al., 2006; Brooks & Flint, 2008; Jun et al., 2009; Shi & Zhu, 2009). There is some conflicting information about preferred biofilm attachment in food industry. Shi & Zhu (2009) reported that more bacterial cells attach to hydrophilic surfaces such as glass and stainless steel, whereas im es et al. (2010) claimed that attachment occurs on

12

surfaces that are more hydrophobic. Although there is discrepancy in the information, these assertions could be interpreted as being relative statements instead of hard facts.

2.5 Bioaerosols
Bioaerosols are particles of biological origin suspended in the air. Bioaerosols are complex mixtures of live and dead microorganisms, pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, fungi, allergens, pollen, plant fibres and viruses, as well as their respective fragments (Douwes et al., 2003; Zorman & Jersek, 2008). Of interest is their relationship to the community composition of dry biofilms on solid-air interfaces. Considering that nosocomial infections and food related illness are increasing public health issues, the identification of potential sources of pathogens and mechanisms of pathogen transfer from source to host are imperative to understand. Bioaerosols is one area to be examined and related to the transfer of pathogens from biofilms to host, in addition to determining their sources and reservoirs (Gilbert et al., 2010). Again relating bioaerosols to dry biofilms and disease is an area to be explored in order to gain further understanding into minimizing and controlling various infections which are transmitted in this way. Of note, is that studying this relationship must take into consideration the built environment where it has been proven that ventilation systems transmit pathogen-containing bioaerosols released from individuals, often through coughing or sneezing, to other areas of the building where infection occurs in vulnerable hosts (Beggs, 2003). Although linking the relationship between bioaerosols and pathogen dissemination are in their infancy, Augustowska & Dutkiewiczs (2006) explained the changes in a hospital ward airborne microbial community over a year by highlighting organisms implicated in nosocomial infections. Roberts et al. (2008) demonstrated that an important nosocomial causative agent Clostridium difficile ­ is indeed spread throughout hospitals by aerial dissemination.

2.6 Biofilm Contribution to Disease
When considering biofilm contribution to disease it is important to recognize the commonly accepted fact that biofilms as a result of their inherent structure can act as reservoirs for pathogens and opportunistic pathogens that can ultimately result in disease and / or infection in a host. Furthermore, biofilms have been implicated as the source of many chronic, persistent infections (Costerton et al., 1999). The increasing frustration of medical personal over the emergence of persistent infections that are immune to antibiotics lead to the important discovery 13

that the origin of many of these infections are indeed biofilms. The intrinsic structure of biofilms affords its residents immunity to many antibiotics as they are incapable of penetrating the matrix. As a result the antibiotics are effective on planktonic counterparts, but not biofilms themselves ­ hence the persistent infections (Costerton et al., 2003). Of interest is that many of the culprits in these persistent infections were determined to be common environmental organisms that individuals normally had adequate immunity against. As postulated by Hall-Stoodley & Stoodley (2005) and demonstrated by Bester et al. (2011) one mechanism for biofilm contribution to disease is the release or detachment of large numbers of cells which are able to subsequently cause infection elsewhere. Additionally, Hall-Stoodley & Stoodley (2005) mentioned that cells, specifically pathogens, within biofilms are phenotypically heterogeneous whereby the potential exists for the virulent phenotype to survive increasing the opportunity for disease occurrence. Further, because of the architecture of a biofilm, cells at the core or lower layers are typically more resistant to antimicrobials whether they are antibiotics or microbiocides. Richards & Melander (2009a) state that the failure of antimicrobials to penetrate the biofilm often occurs because they become trapped in the EPS. Understandably, these protective mechanisms against antimicrobials can result in repeat infections as the core pathogen source remains undisturbed (Costerton et al., 1999; Richards & Melander, 2009b). According to statistics released by the United tates of Americas National Institute of Health, 65 to 80% of all microbial infections in humans are biofilm-mediated. Known medical issues associated with biofilms include, but are not exclusive to: burn wound infections, ear infections, tooth decay and catheter infections (Richards & Melander, 2009b). Given this information, plus the known astronomical cost of these ailments it is easily understood why there is so much research being carried out to understand all aspects of biofilms. 2.6.1 Nosocomial Infections Nosocomial infections or hospital-acquired infections are of increasing public health concern because of their magnifying occurrences, and known morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences around the world (Beggs 2003; Gilbert et al., 2010). Many bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Clostridium, have been implicated in nosocomial infections. Knowing that the majority of microbial infections are biofilm-related, one can infer that biofilms are also a leading instigator of nosocomial infections. To that point, more than a decade ago it 14

was estimated that 65% of nosocomial infections were biofilm-associated with a treatment cost of over $1 billion per year (Mah & O'Toole, 2001). Beggs (2003) notes that nosocomial infections can be spread directly via person-toperson contact, such as from improperly washed hands of hospital staff to patient, or indirectly via a contaminated intermediate object such as endoscope or implant. Recall, that aerial dissemination of Clostridium and subsequent infection has been proven (Roberts et al., 2008). 2.6.2 Infectious Diseases Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, and can spread directly or indirectly. Examples include: cholera, malaria measles, C. difficile and Lyme disease (WHO, 2011). As infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, there is undoubtedly a link between the biofilm mode of growth and infectious diseases. With the global emergence of infectious diseases over the past 20 years, the link between infectious diseases and biofilms is under increasing investigation (Weinstein, 1998) .

2.7 Pathogens and Opportunistic Pathogens
2.7.1 Introduction Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, while opportunistic pathogens are microorganisms that are disease-causing only when the hosts resistance is low (Willey, 2011). Costerton et al. (1999) claimed that many common environmental organisms which normally cause no adverse effects in individuals become pathogenic when individuals are immunocompromised i.e. opportunistic pathogens. To this point, many pathogens are deemed opportunistic pathogens in hospitals and clinics where there are a plethora of immuno-comprised patients, with increased vulnerability to the effects of otherwise harmless bacteria. As HallStoodley & Stoodley (2005) asserted, the intrinsic biofilm properties of protection and detachment promote the dissemination of pathogens. As such, it must be considered that biofilms found throughout these environments play an integral role in the transmission of pathogens and / or opportunistic pathogens. The identification and infectious doses of pathogens is of the utmost importance to maintain and promote health integrity. The following list is not exhaustive, but provides a brief overview of common pathogens including their diagnostic characteristics.

15

2.7.2 Enteric Pathogens- Family: Enterobacteriaceae Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are defined as being Gram-negative, rods which are facultative anaerobes, and motile by peritrichous flagella. They do not form endospores or microcysts (Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. 1984-). Members of this family associated with nosocomial infections include, but are not limited to the genera Salmonella, Escherichia, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. Salmonella associated nosocomial infections can originate from infected patients and contaminated foods or devices. Raw eggs are often implicated in Salmonella infections, and devices such as gastroscopes and rectal thermometers have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks (Hospital epidemiology and infection control). Klebsiella biofilms have been associated with diseases originating from both central venous and urinary catheters (Donlan, 2002). Enterobacter as the name implies, are enteric bacteria known to cause nosocomial infections including, but not limited to, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, bacteremia and nosocomial pneumonia (Chow et al., 1991). Enterobacter display a strong affinity for aqueous environments with reservoirs being water, soil, and the human gastrointestinal tract, in addition to proven colonization of drinking water distribution systems, distilled water systems, humidifiers and soft tissues throughout the body (Hospital epidemiology and infection control; Simões et al., 2010) 2.7.3 Non-Enteric Pathogens 2.7.3.1 Genus Staphylococcus Are characterized as being spherical shaped cells that can be arranged singly, in pairs or clustered; Gram-positive, non-motile; facultative anaerobes, although known to grow best under aerobic conditions (Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. 1984-). Problems associated with Staphylococcus sp. namely, Staphylococcus aureus include its resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotic, methicillin. Commonly referred to as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), it has been proven to cause nosocomial infections by infecting sites such as damaged skin, and is prevalent in healthcare facilities around the world (Beggs, 2003).

16

2.7.3.2 Genus Pseudomonas Straight or slightly curved rod shaped cells; Gram-negative aerobes, non-fermenting; motile by 1+ polar flagella (Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. 1984-). Several pseudonomads have been used as model organisms due to their prevalence in biofilms in natural conditions and the ease of flowcell culturability in laboratory conditions (Heydorn et al., 2000). Pseudomonads are some of the best modelled organisms for studying biofilm formation due to the non-fastidious growth requirements (Richards & Melander, 2009b). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ubiquitous in hospitals and water systems (Ayliffe et al., 1974; Lakretz et al., 2010). Costerton (1987) opined that P. aeruginosa is the most widely used organism employed in studying biofilm formation, and Sauer et al. (2004) asserted that it is the most medically important biofilm-forming species. P. aeruginosa is known to cause incurable infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients (Lewis, 2007; Richards & Melander, 2009a) and is one of the four most common Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens (Weinstein, 1998) In addition to P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida are important opportunistic pathogens. P. fluorescens commonly encountered in soil and water habitats that has been implicated in nosocomial infections (Baum et al., 2009). P. putida is commonly associated with plants (Richards & Melander, 2009b; Kaplan, 2010). 2.7.3.3 Genus Acinetobacter A genetically diverse group of rod shaped cells that become spherical in stationary phase of growth. Members of Acinetobacter are Gram-negative, aerobic, non-fermenting bacteria, which have been isolated from soil, sewage and skin (Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. 1984-; Beggs, 2003; Gaddy & Actis, 2009). Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus are opportunistic pathogens demonstrating multidrug resistance. Both organisms have been implicated as infectious agents of diseases such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septicaemia and wound infections (Beggs, 2003; Gaddy & Actis, 2009; Richards & Melander, 2009a). 2.7.3.4 Genus Clostridium Rod shaped cells; usually Gram-negative; obligate anaerobes that form endospores (Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. 1984-). Clostridium difficile has been implicated in nosocomial infections, specifically as the causative agent of nosocomial infectious diarrhoea 17

(Hospital epidemiology and infection control). It is known that C. difficile produces two toxins: an entertoxin and a cytotoxin. The minimum lethal dose (MLD) of the entertoxin in mice was determined to be 1 x 10 6 MLD/ mL (Fu et al., 2004). C. difficile is the cause of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), "a frequently occurring healthcare-associated infection, which is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality amongst elderly patients in healthcare facilities" (Roberts et al., 2008). 2.7.3.5 Genus Chryseobacterium A six species genus, possessing Gram-negative, bacillus-shaped and non-fermentative diagnostic characteristics, that was recently classified from the parent genus Flavobacterium because of proven phylogenetic differences (Lambiase et al., 2007). Reservoirs of Chryseobacterium are primarily in soil and water (Kirby et al., 2004; Lambiase et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2010). Select Chryseobacterium species are known opportunistic pathogens shown to cause bacteremia in newborns and immuno-comprised patients (Kirby et al., 2004), in addition to being isolated in conjunction with P. aeruginosa from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients (Lambiase et al., 2007). As Kirby et al. (2004) noted, Chryseobacterium have a relatively low degree of pathogenicity; however, their prevalence is sufficient enough to warrant their inclusion in a worldwide antimicrobial bacteria surveillance program to record susceptibility to common antibiotics administered in hospitals. Of importance is that environmental studies have revealed Chryeobacterium's capability of surviving in chlorine-treated water distribution systems going on to colonize sink drains, raising particular concern in hospitals (Kirby et al., 2004). 2.7.3.6 Genus Sphingomonas Sphingomonas species are Gram-negative, obligate aerobes with single polar flagellum when motile (Balkwill et al., 1997). Genus members are noted as strong candidates for bioremediation and waste treatment as a result of possessing broad catabolic capabilities including an aptitude at degrading chlorinated biphenyls, toluene, naphthalene, xylene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Fredrickson et al., 1995). Further lending Sphingomonas to the

18

aforementioned tasks is the origins in soil, water, sediments and sub-surface geological formations (Fredrickson et al., 1995; Balkwill et al., 1997). 2.7.4 Conclusion Of interest to the current study was the environmental origins ­soil, water, sediments ­ of many bacterial genera which are now known residents of clinical environments and causative nosocomial infection agents. The link between the environmental origins of many bacteria and medically-relevant and industrial settings is important to consider when entertaining biofilm reduction strategies. 2.7.5 Infectious Doses of Common Pathogens Understanding the infectious dose of pathogens or their toxins requires consideration that it is a subjective term which is dependent upon the "immunological status of the host and the natural infectivity of the organism" (Bhunia, 2008). Table 1 describes the infectious doses of some common nosocomial infectious agents.

2.8 Biofilm Response to Adverse Conditions
2.8.1 Persister Cells Persister cells are a sub-population of cells, both planktonic and biofilm-associated, that are adept at defying the deleterious effects of antibiotics or microbiocides (Lewis, 2007; Richards & Melander, 2009a). These cells represent an altruistic behavior whereby in the unlikely event that all cells within the population are killed the survivors are able to pass along their genetic information to re-establish the community. In essence, this evolutionary mechanism explains the difficulty in overcoming chronic infections. Lewis (2007) highlighted the obstacles faced by clinical microbiologists in overcoming these persister populations in medical settings (i.e. antibiotic resistance). Although persister cells represent a small percentage of the entire population it is of the utmost importance to consider this adaptation when implementing a biofilm eradication scheme. Lewis (2007) estimated that no more than 1% of the entire biofilm population is comprised of persister cells indicating that the persister state is not the preferred mode of growth. Although persister cells exist in all the places where biofilms can be found, the eradication of persister cells is possible through the use of antiseptics (Lewis, 2007). Understandably, antiseptics cannot be applied systemically to eradicate biofilms, as they are toxic to all cells whether they are commensal, pathogenic or beneficial. Therefore, multipletiered efforts to eradicate biofilms causing chronic infections must be teased out experimentally and determined to not harm the patient. With this in mind, the current study aimed to shed insight into a multiple stage biofilm control method that could most certainly be applied to indwelling medical devices before their insertion or upon removal to inhibit biofilm growth or cause death. 2.8.2 Nutrient Starvation From the onset of presenting the theory of the biofilm mode of growth, the role of nutrient availability was predicted to have a marked effect on the orientation of microorganisms within the biofilm and upon biofilm development itself (Costerton et al., 1978). Several studies suggest that the biofilm mode of growth is the result of a lack of nutrients in an environment, causing planktonic cells to coalesce into biofilms whereby an ecological advantage is achieved through the optimized use of limited resources (Brown et al., 1977; Flemming, 1993). Since 21

biofilms are naturally-occurring, they are often found in oligotrophic environments, such as aquatic ecosystems (McBain et al., 2003; im es et al., 2007). As such, it can be inferred that the biofilm allows microorganisms to persevere in oligotrophic conditions. What needs to be considered is that not only do these oligotrophic conditions exist in natural environments, but in fact these low-nutrient conditions are present in medical and food processing facilities, homes, and water distribution networks, to name but a few (Shi & Zhu, 2009; Brooks & Flint, 2008; LeChevallier et al., 1987). These settings as a result of sound hygienic practices and the promotion of public health and welfare are repeatedly being disinfected, sanitized or sterilized. However, the problem of pathogen transmission arises as a result of the biofilms inherent protective mechanisms that shield microorganisms embedded in the matrix from the intended effects of antimicrobials. As a result, the application of bactericidal agents does not eradicate the biofilm in its entirety, but allows cells (potentially pathogens) to remain unaffected by these treatments. In practice, health and safety measures have proven futile in many instances of deterring pathogen transmission and subsequent infection, hence the magnitude of research devoted to biofilm eradication. Imposing nutrient starvation, starting with carbon upon biofilms may be integral to developing effective infection control measures. By carrying out such investigations under controlled laboratory conditions it becomes possible to gain insight into a biofilms fundamental behavioural strategies under imposed environmental stresses. Of importance when examining biofilms under nutrient starved conditions is the ratio of sessile and planktonic cells (Costerton et al., 2003; Hall-Stoodley & Stoodley, 2005), where planktonic cells are constantly being dispersed by biofilms at low rates as part of the biofilms natural cycle (Sauer et al., 2004). To this end, Delaquis et al. (1989) reported a detachment of cells by way of active emigration in addition to normal cell detachment activities in a pureculture Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm under glucose starvation. Similar results were obtained by Gjermansen et al. (2005) who observed a global dissolution of a pure-culture Pseudomonas putida biofilm within minutes of imposed carbon starvation, as measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Additional support for the detachment of cells from a biofilm under nutrient starvation conditions is presented by Hunt et al. (2004) who reported a 90% detachment of cells from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm upon induced carbon starvation. Further, Hunt 22

et al. (2004) quantified that 2-7% of biofilm present tenaciously remained attached well into induced starvation conditions, demonstrating that starvation in and of itself is not sufficient for biofilm eradication; recall the theory of persister cells. With the insight that a certain percentage of cells remain attached to a given substrate, Bester et al. (2011) tested the robustness of a mature pure-culture Pseudomonas aeruginosa CT07::gfp biofilm to induced carbon-starvation conditions followed by the reintroduction of carbon into the system. An immediate recovery of the starved biofilm towards pre-starvation levels was observed using planktonic cell yield, and measures of biofilm metabolism and architecture. 2.8.3 Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation Ultraviolet (UV) light ranges from 100 to 400 nm on the electromagnetic spectrum, and is sub-divided into UV-A (315 ­ 400 nm), UV-B (280 ­ 315 nm), UV-C (200 ­ 280 nm) and vacuum UV (100 ­ 200 nm) (Fig.1). In the context of the current study UV-A, UV-B and UV-C will be considered. UV irradiation is a physical disinfectant that has long been used to disinfect drinking water and decontaminate treated wastewater (Harris et al., 1987; Hijnen et al., 2006). UV, specifically UV-C or germicidal UV, has known efficiency at inactivating viruses, bacteria, pathogens and protozoa in addition to being able to treat large volumes at a relatively low cost (Hijnen & Medema, 2005). Furthermore, UV can also be used to control biofouling and in water treatment processes without producing detrimental by-products (Dykstra et al., 2007; Lakretz et al., 2010). Interestingly, a huge environmental benefit of using UV is its lack of residual byproduct(s) formation (many of which are known to cause injurious effects to aquatic ecosystems); however, as noted by Dykstra et al. (2007), the lack of residual disinfectant results in the need to use UV in conjunction with a secondary disinfectant, such as chlorine dioxide, to achieve biologically stable water i.e. safe drinking water, which negates the benefits described by using UV. Importantly, Lakretz et al. (2010) demonstrated UV as a preventative strategy to biofilm control in the disinfection of water. UV is produced by the sun. UV-A and UV-B are able to penetrate the earths ozone layer to reach the earths surface where they trigger necessary Vitamin D production and result in skin effects such as tanning, sun burns, or in more severe instances skin cancers (Oppenländer, 2007). Conversely, UV-C is unable to penetrate the ozone layer and must be synthetically produced on earth (Elasri & Miller, 1999). UV-C was applied in the current study because of its known

23

inclusion of the germicidal or pathogenic bacteria inactivation at a value of 254 nm (Elasri & Miller, 1999; Hijnen & Medema, 2005). At this wavelength direct DNA damage is caused as pyrimidine dimers are formed that inhibit replication and transcription of the DNA, ultimately preventing the cell from multiplying (Harris et al., 1987; Hijnen et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010). With regards to the necessary dose or fluence to achieve bacterial inactivation, several values can be found in the literature, depending on the application. Bak et al. (2009) stated that the dose required for effectively killing 99.9% of viable planktonic cells known to form biofilms on in-dwelling medical devices was between 1 ­ 30 mJ/cm2. Whereas Pozos et al. (2004) cited the effective dose range required in the United States of America (USA) for potable water as being 7.7 ­ 259 mJ/cm2. What is important to keep in mind is that dose requirements for eliminating planktonic cell populations versus biofilm eradication are remarkably different. Table 2 provides bacterial inactivation values of common water-borne organisms. Table 2: Required UV-C destruction doses for common bacteria. Organism Salmonella typhi Staphylococcus aureus Campylobacter jejuni Escherichia coli UV-C Dose Required for Destruction (mJ/cm2) 2 -10 6.6 0.5 ­ 6 6.6 48 ­ 64 10.5 6.6 0.6 ­ 4 1 - 12 Source (Hijnen et al., 2006) www.uvp.com (Hijnen et al., 2006) (Hijnen et al., 2006); www.uvp.com Clostridium perfringens Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas fluorescens Vibrio cholera Legionella pneumophilia (Hijnen et al., 2006) www.uvp.com www.uvp.com (Hijnen et al., 2006) (Hijnen et al., 2006)

Several investigations have used UV in conjunction with other disinfection processes to increase the efficacy of treatment when aiming for clean drinking water (Lakretz et al., 2011). In the current study the objective was to determine the effect of employing UV while biofilm cells are stressed with the hope of destroying the biofilm, compared to the effect when they have 24

recovered from a critical stress state. The application of such a tiered process has far-reaching implications when considering effective antimicrobial treatments to remove biofilms in unwanted places such as on water distribution filters and in hospitals and homes.

2.9 Control
Understandably with the known public health and economic implications associated with biofilms their control and eradication is a burgeoning area of research. There are numerous incentives to find practical, low cost solutions to biofilms in all impacted industries. Studies range from examining control methods on specific bacterial species (Gaddy & Actis, 2009) to control methods on entire microbial communities (Richards & Melander, 2009a; Richards & Melander, 2009b; Simões et al., 2010). As a result of all the research being carried out, in addition to the economics of biofilm control there is an ever increasing selection of commercially available products targeting biofilm control or inhibition. It has been determined that the initial attachment of planktonic cells to surfaces usually exhibits a lag until growth starts; however, when cells from the biofilm detach and colonize further downstream the cells behave like biofilm cells whereby reattachment occurs quickly and no lag is observed (Brooks & Flint, 2008). This can complicate the use of control products that are meant to attack biofilms once attached; timing is an issue in these cases. Further, binding properties of products to a wide variety of surfaces in affected industries has been difficult to

25

obtain. For example, a product that binds to stainless steel, may not readily bind to ceramic surfaces which can be adjacent to the stainless steel. With regards to the control product itself, it must be ensured that by-products are non-toxic and that the product is easy to use, safe and efficient. As noted by Boyce (2009) two compounds commonly found in antimicrobial disinfectants are formaldehyde and chlorine dioxide. Both of which have proven effective in eradicating microorganisms; however, potentially toxic end products are produced that require specific disposal techniques. As a result of the associated toxicity, replacement products are being developed and tested. Lastly, depending on the industry and country there are different standards and regulations for the acceptable levels of pathogens. This can create problems when trying to test products for control to be exported, additionally it has been especially problematic in the food industry where meats and products are constantly being exported and must not only meet the guidelines in the country of origin but also those of the final destination (Roberts et al., 2008).

Chapter 3: Experimental
3.1 Introduction
Globally, the past two decades have seen an increase in the number of nosocomial infections as well as antibiotic resistance in bacteria (Weinstein, 1998; Clark & de Calcina-Goff, 2009). Annexed to unprecedented international travel and changing environmental conditions, microbes are being transported and are surviving in new locations contributing to the worldwide increase in infectious diseases (Wilson, 1995). Biofilms are known causative agents contributing to a wide variety of persistent infections and chronic diseases in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals (Costerton et al., 1999; Richards & Melander, 2009a). With an estimated 80% of the worlds microbial biomass housed in biofilms, it is apparent that forming these attached heterogeneous communities shrouded in a self-secreted matrix is advantageous to their propagation and survival (Richards & Melander, 2009a). Further, the surrounding matrix composed of exopolymeric substance (EPS) has been proven to aid in shielding biofilm community members from a variety of antimicrobial treatments, in addition to functioning as the biofilms scaffolding (Gaddy & Actis, 2009; Kaplan, 2010). As such, biofilms have been the focus of many investigations aiming to understand the mechanisms that allow them to withstand various antimicrobial treatments, in addition to their role in harbouring and transmitting pathogens. Determining reservoirs for pathogens in domestic, medical and industrial settings is of increasing importance in order to reduce the transmission of disease in these environments. Ultimately, eradication of these disease-harbouring biofilms in undesirable locations is the goal. Nutrients are integral to bacterial survival and may determine the community structure within the biofilm (Costerton et al., 1978). The inherent biofilm architecture results in some cells being subjected to nutrient limitation, restricting these cells to a slow-growing or dormant state (Costerton et al., 1999; Mah & O'Toole, 2001). It is well known that biofilms survive in oligotrophic environments or settings characterized by nutrient fluxes such as drinking water distribution systems (LeChevallier et al., 1987; Costerton et al., 1995). Bester et al. (2011) demonstrated that the removal of carbon from the growth medium sustaining a pure-culture biofilm resulted in an immediate decrease in biofilm metabolism. The biofilm remained metabolically inactive throughout the carbon-starvation period, only to promptly return to pre27

starvation activity upon the reintroduction of carbon. This finding instigated the investigation into whether the application of a second stress to a metabolically inactive biofilm would be successful in deterring biofilm propagation. Knowing that ultraviolet (UV) light has long been used as a disinfectant in water and wastewater industries (Hijnen et al., 2006), it was selected as the second stress to be applied to the carbon-starved pure-culture biofilms. UV, specifically UVC, is used in large-scale industrial operations because of its capabilities of disinfecting large volumes of water without producing detrimental chemical by-products (Dykstra et al. 2007). UV-C directly damages the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of bacteria and other microorganisms, rendering them incapable of replication (Li et al., 2010). Additionally, UV is emerging as a preventative strategy against biofilm-related problems in water disinfection (Lakretz et al., 2010). The current study measured the number of cells released by the biofilm (biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield) and metabolic responses of an environmentally-relevant mixed community biofilm to carbon-starvation and the effects of UV exposure on pure-culture biofilms.

3.2 Materials and Methods
3.2.1 Mixed Community Isolation and Characterization 3.2.1.1 Sink-drain mixed community isolation A sink-drain sample was retrieved from a high traffic university public washroom by swabbing 5 cm from the top of the sink outlet using a Quick Swab (3M, London, ON, Cat. # 6433). The swab was placed into the letheen broth and transported to the laboratory to be further processed. In the laboratory, the Quick Swab was vortexed at top speed for 1 min to ensure the release of bacterial cells from the swab. The suspension was then added to 50 mL of minimal salt medium (MSM) which contained (grams per liter): NaCl (2.0), NH4Cl (1.0), MgSO4·7H2O (0.12), Na2HPO4 (4.24), KH2PO4 (2.7); and trace element solution (1mL/L): CaCl2 (0.99), FeSO4·7H20 (0.5), MnSO4·2H20 (0.2), NaMoO4·2H20 (0.25). The two carbon sources were sodium pyruvate and starch (Caldwell & Lawrence, 1986; Delaquis et al., 1989; Wolfaardt et al., 1994). The sample was then incubated with 250 rpm shaking for 24 h at room temperature (24°C ±2°C). Serial dilutions in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride were prepared from 1mL of sample, with 100 µL of dilution spread-plated onto MSM, R2A and 10% tryptic soy broth (TSB) media. The plates were inverted and left at room temperature for 7 days to encourage growth. Ten visually distinguishable colonies (labelled as SD 1-10) were isolated from plates from all three media types for further characterization. Single colonies were picked and restreaked three more times to ensure the purity of the isolates. 3.2.1.2 DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification Genomic DNA from the isolates was extracted from an overnight culture using the GeneluteTM Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit ( igma-Aldrich Cat. # NA2110-1KT, Oakville, ON). The extracted DNA was frozen at -20°C until PCR amplification. In each PCR reaction a volume of 50 µl was prepared consisting of 1.0 µl of U341GC#2 (5-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3) as the forward primer, 1.0 µl of U758 (5CTACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3) as the reverse primer, 8.0 µl of 1.25 mM dNTPs, 0.625 µl of

BSA, 32.375 µl of dH2O, 5.0 µl of buffer, 0.5 µl of rTaq polymerase (New England Biolabs, Canada) and 1.0 µl of DNA from each sample.

29

An Eppendorf PCR machine was heated to 96°C for 5 min followed by thermocycling at 94°C for 1 min with the annealing temperature set at 65°C, which decreased by 1°C every cycle, for 10 cycles. Each cycle was followed by an elongation for 3 min at 72°C (Muyzer & Smalla, 1998). PCR products were visualized after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. PCR products were prepared by mixing 1 µl of SYBR® Safe (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) dye with 5 µl of PCR product. A total of 5 µl was loaded into each of the wells along with a well of 100 bp ladder (Fermentas, Cat. No. SM0241, Burlington, Ontario). The gel was run for 40 min at 85 volts (V). Upon completion, the gel images were captured with UVP BioDoc-ItTM Imaging ystem, and DNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop 2000c. 3.2.1.3 Sequencing and identification The PCR products were prepared for sequencing using a Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction Kit (IBI Scientific, Peosta, IA, Cat. No. IB47020). DNA sequencing and subsequent species identification were performed using BLAST from the sequence information obtained from The Centre for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. 3.2.2 Culture medium and growth conditions MSM was used for subsequent cultivation of the isolates and the lab strain P. aeruginosa PA01 gfp (PAO1). 3.2.3 Continuous-flow culture of biofilms 3.2.3.1 Flowcell A four-channel conventional Plexiglass flowcell (flowcell) was milled as previously described by Wolfaardt et al. (1994) and Bester et al. (2011), with channel dimensions of 40 mm x 5 mm x 4 mm; length, width and height respectively. A continuous-flow of sterile medium was delivered to the flowcell at a flow rate of 17 mL h-1, and critical dilution rate of 21.25 h-1, (Reynolds number 1.03), using a Watson-Marlow 205U peristaltic pump at a tension of 2.8, via silicone tubing (VWR International Cat #: 60985-714; inside diameter (ID), 0.062 mm) and Tygon tubing (R-3603). Tygon tubing was used over the pump and immediately upstream of the flowcell to impede microbial growth. The flowcell was covered with two side-by-side quartz slides (Chemglass Life Sciences, Vineland, NJ) that each measured 24 x 50 x 1mm (Fig.2). The

30

flowcell was maintained at a 90° angle, instead of the previously described 0° to encourage the release of gas from the channels.

Figure 2: Schematic diagram of the experimental continuous flow set-up. MSM medium was delivered through the network of silicon and Tygon tubing via a peristaltic pump to the fourchannel flowcell. Effluent was delivered to a waste receptacle via silicon tubing. 3.2.3.2 Disinfection and inoculation The system was disinfected with a continuous flow of 10% sodium hypochlorite (v/v) solution for 3 h, followed by an overnight flow of sterile distilled water (dH2O). The water was replaced with sterile growth medium for at least 0.5 h, at which time the medium flow was stopped in preparation for inoculation. An overnight 5 mL pre-culture in sterile medium was prepared prior to inoculation; 100 µL per channel of the pre-culture was then inoculated into the flowcell using a sterile 1 mL HSW Henke Sass Wolf GmbH syringe (National Scientific Company, Rockwood, TN) and 25G 1½ " needle (VWR, Cat # CA15003-024). The pump was restarted 1 h post-inoculation, having allowed the bacteria to start biofilm formation. 3.2.4 Enumeration of biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield Effluent samples (1mL) were collected from the flowcell at 24 h intervals. Samples were then serially diluted in 0.9% sterile saline solution, with duplicate spread-plates being prepared

31

from 100 µl dilutions. After 48 h incubation at room temperature colonies were counted and reported as CFU mL-1. 3.2.5 Carbon dioxide production The carbon dioxide monitoring reactor (CMR) was set up using the open loop configuration as previously described by Bester et al. (2010). The setup (Fig. 3) included a 20 mL serum vial with a butyl stopper perforated by four individual 16G ½ inch needles: in-flowing and out-flowing liquid (effluent), and in-flowing and out-flowing gas. All measurements were taken using the Mass Flow Controller GFC Carbon Dioxide Analyzer (Aaloborg, Orangeburg, NY) and captured by LI-820 v.2.0.0. software. CO2 measurements were taken for up to 2 h at 24 h intervals.

Figure 3: A schematic diagram of the experimental setup showing the flow cell and the CMR. Source: Bester et al., 2010. 3.2.6 Determining effluent cell origin In order to verify that planktonic cell replication in the flowcell chambers did not contribute to biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield numbers, the maximum specific planktonic growth rate (µmax
planktonic)

for each organism was determined from at least three replicate batch

cultures. The doubling time of each organism was calculated as follows:

32

As the critical dilution rate for the continuous flow system (D = 21.25 h -1) greatly exceeded the µmaxplanktonic for all organisms, it can be concluded that cells in the effluent originated from the biofilm and were not independently replicating planktonic cells (Bester et al., 2010). 3.2.7 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation UV radiation was applied using a 4 Watt UVP handheld lamp (UVGL-15 Compact UV Lamp) (UV lamp) possessing both UV-A (365 nm) and UV-C (254 nm) wavelength settings. The lamp was positioned 5 cm above agar plates, and 0.8 cm above the flowcell. The dose (or fluence) delivered by the UV lamp was 292 mJ/cm2, as calculated from radiometer readings and residence time in the flowcell. The dose delivered exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended range used for disinfecting potable water (Pozos et al., 2004). 3.2.7.1 Determining the most effective UV lamp setting The inhibition of bacterial growth on streak plates was used to determine whether to use the 254 nm or 365 nm setting. Each of the plates was divided with one half being exposed to UV light and the other half blocked from receiving UV light. The agar was directly exposed to UV immediately after being streaked. 3.2.7.2 The extent of UV-C penetration through borosilicate glass and quartz cover slips Spread and streak plates were subjected to UV-C with suspended borosilicate or quartz glass cover slips above the agar. UV-C exposure times were 0.5 min, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min. Unexposed UV-C plates served as the reference. Plates were UV-C exposed immediately after being spread or streaked, and bare agar was exposed to the UV-C directly. 3.2.7.3 Planktonic Culture 1/10 (v/v) and 1/1000 (v/v) Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp cultures were passed through the flowcell simultaneously, while being subjected to UV-C. Both cultures were inoculated into sterile medium. Sterile flasks were constantly agitated and kept cool in order to deter further growth in the flask. Effluent samples were obtained from downstream of the flowcell at 15 min and 1 h, serially diluted and used to determine cell number using traditional plating techniques. Residence time in the flowcell is 169 sec. 33

3.3 Results and Discussion
3.3.1 Mixed Community Isolation and Identification The ten morphologically distinct colonies that were isolated from the sink-drain were grown on R2A, TSB and MSM agar, which ultimately yielded BLAST results from the amplified 16S rRNA gene sequence to five species closely related to isolates from other drain and wastewater environments (Table 3). The five isolates selected to create an artificial mixed drain community for flowcell experiments were SD-1, SD-4, SD-5, SD-6 and SD-8. An artificial sink-drain mixed community was constructed for the proposed dual-stress regime using these 5 isolates for their individual relevancy to public health and / or industrial applications. For decades, pathogens and opportunistic pathogens have been known to colonize sink-drains in hospitals (Whitby & Rampling, 1972) and homes (Finch et al., 1978). To this point, sink-drains are under increasing scrutiny as pathogen transmission sights in hospitals (Doring et al., 1991), and homes (McBain et al., 2003). Hota et al. (2009) demonstrated that biofilms in hospital room sinks transfer pathogens to healthcare workers through hand-washing, or to areas surrounding the sink. In this instance Pseudomonas aeruginosa was transferred as a result of the poor sink-drain design and placement. Further, biofilms of varying thickness and community composition have been detected throughout water distribution networks (LeChevallier et al., 1987). Additionally, bacteria isolated from biofilms found in several sink-drains and throughout water distribution networks are known to cause biofouling of engineered surfaces leading to the increased use of disinfectants in these systems which may directly or indirectly cause adverse environmental and health impacts (Flemming, 2002). Sink-drains and piping networks, being aqueous environments intermittently supplied with nutrients, are favourable sites for microbial colonization and biofilm formation (Brooke, 2008). McBain et al. (2003) asserted that sink-drains possess sufficient available substrate providing ample nutrients for the formation of thick biofilms. Moreover, the standard sink-drain design lends itself to the accumulation of microorganisms within its convoluted piping network with areas of low turbulence preceded by high turbulence (Charaf, 1997).

34

Sink-drains are a terminus of water distribution networks; therefore, biofilms whether in the sink-drain proper or dispersed along the piping network should be taken into account when considering the role of pathogen propagation and dispersal from sink-drains (LeChevallier et al., 1987; Anaissie et al., 2002). Since it has been established that biofilms in hospital drains can act as pathogen reservoirs, a natural extension to these studies would be to investigate domestic drains as potential pathogen reservoirs. P. aeruginosa, a well-known pathogen in immuno-compromised patients, has been isolated from both domestic and hospital sinks; however, Whitby & Rampling (1972), as well as Ayliffe et al. (1974) found that P. aeruginosa contamination was far less frequent in domestic environments. This can be attributed to the fact that P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in hospitals. To this end, it is worthwhile to note that Pseudomonas is the most abundant bacteria in drinking water distribution systems (Lakretz et al., 2010; Simões et al., 2010). It is well known that sink-drains harbour a wide variety of microorganisms. This knowledge has been the incentive driving several investigations whose aim has been to identify and characterize specific microorganisms present in hospitals and domestic sink drains and water distribution networks in order to promote infection control (Perryman & Flournoy, 1980; LeChevallier et al., 1987; McBain et al., 2003; Brooke, 2008). As expected several bacterial genera have been isolated from hospital and domestic sinks as well as water distribution networks. The majority of studies focus on one environment; however, trends of organisms common to the three environments have emerged, whereupon more in-depth research to understand these microorganisms has been carried out. For example species of Moraxella, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas have been isolated from all three environments, whereas Staphyloccocus and Chryseobacterium were isolated from domestic sinks, Serratia and Acinetobacter were isolated from hospital sinks and water distribution networks and Sphingomonas was isolated from hospital and domestic sinks (Finch et al., 1978; Perryman & Flournoy, 1980; LeChevallier et al., 1987; Charaf, 1997; McBain et al., 2003; Brooke, 2008). Based on this information and what could be isolated from the drain sample, a sink-drain model mixed community biofilm comprised of five members was cultivated. Microorganisms were selected based on their lasting presence in the sink-drain by comparing 35

two samples taken six months apart, and performing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to match DNA bands. Additionally, selection was based upon the inclusion of representative genera as confirmed by relevant literature.

3.3.3 Mixed Community Response to Carbon-Starvation The average biofilm-derived planktonic cell yields from two mixed community flowcell inoculations were used to determine when the biofilms had transitioned from exponential growth into stationary growth (Fig. 4). From these two trials it was observed that biofilm steady-state according to planktonic cell yield was achieved between 72 ­ 96 h. It was decided that future mixed community biofilms grown in the flowcell were to be starved, or receive UV application at 72-74 h, based on these observations. The response of a five member mixed community biofilm to 96 h carbon-starvation (Fig. 5a) was determined by measuring carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1). Carbon starvation was induced at 73 h (Fig. 5b) until 169 h when carbon was reintroduced into the system (Fig. 5c). All induced carbon-starvation and reintroduction responses were monitored by carbon dioxide production in real-time. The industrious response of the mixed community biofilm to carbon reintroduction after 96 h of carbon-starvation lead to the investigation of a mixed communitys response to 120 h of carbonstarvation (Fig. 6a) using the same measurement parameters. The pre-determined carbonstarvation time of 73 h was used as the reference point to induce starvation upon the biofilm (Fig. 6b). Carbon was reintroduced into the system at 193 h (Fig. 6c). Although both mixed community biofilms were starved at 73 h, their C02 production levels differed, which may be attributed to the different origins of inocula (Kroukamp et al., 2010) despite each community being inoculated at identical OD600 and comprised of the same members: SD-1, SD-4, SD-5, SD-6 and SD-8. Whether the biofilm was carbon-starved for 96 h 37

or 120 h the responses of the mixed community biofilms to the reintroduction of carbon is prompt with increased C0 2 production occurring within 1 h. The rapid metabolic response of the biofilms demonstrates that at least some of the community members within the flowcell are able to withstand prolonged periods of starvation, suggesting that the biofilm acts a reservoir for nutrients affording its members protection under adverse environmental conditions. Considering that the sink-drain origin of the mixed community members is characterized by nutrient fluxes, variability in water availability and episodes of disinfection or sanitization, investigating the effects of these parameters individually is important to understanding the overall biofilm mechanisms of survival in constantly changing environments. With similar rapid metabolic responses of two mixed community biofilms to carbon-starvation and carbon reintroduction, in addition to the known metabolic responses of a pure-culture biofilm presented by Bester et al. (2011), the resiliency of biofilms under nutrient deprivation conditions is further exemplified. As expected in both mixed community biofilms an increase of biofilm-derived planktonic cells accompanied the first 72 h of growth, until a steady-state was entered. With induced carbon-starvation, biofilm-derived planktonic cell yields decreased during carbon-starvation by less than a log reduction, demonstrating that despite imposed stress, and minimal metabolic activity, the biofilm is capable of releasing cells into the surrounding environment at relatively constant rates. The constant release of biofilm-derived cells has far-reaching implications when considering the dissemination of pathogens. For example, planktonic revertants from a sink-drain may become aerosolized and be transported several meters from the original source, whereupon contact with a surface or vector may initiate pathogenesis. Conversely, the released cells may come into direct contact with an immuno-compromised patient in a hospital resulting in nosocomial infection, or a hospital outbreak.

3.3.4 Pure-Culture Response to Carbon Starvation Responses of a PA01 biofilm to 72 h carbon-starvation (Fig. 7a) were measured by carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1). The carbon dioxide (ppm) production of PA01 at induced carbon-starvation (Fig.7b) and 40

subsequent reintroduction (Fig.7c), were measured by the same metabolic and cell yield parameters. Responses of a SD-1 biofilm under identical conditions, and using identical measurement parameters were obtained (Figs.8 a-c). PA01 and SD-1 metabolic and cell yield responses were as expected when relating the data to that presented by Bester et al. (2011), especially since the carbon-starvation time in the current study was 48 h less than that presented by Bester et al. (2011). Notable differences between the current study and that of Bester et al. (2011) were the current studys use of sodium pyruvate and starch as opposed to citrate as a carbon source. Further Bester et al. (2011) carried out their study on Pseudomonas sp. strain CT07::gfp, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp and SD-1 were used in the current study.

SD-6 is displayed in Figure 9, the left half of the plate (a) was exposed to UV-A, while the right half (b) was covered to block UV-A penetration. In a separate experiment, constructed community streak plates were exposed to 5 min UV-C (254 nm), with SD-1 shown in Figure 10. The left half (a) of the plate was exposed to UV-C, while the right half (b) was covered. UV-C is commonly accepted as the optimal range for the inactivation of bacteria and other microorganisms (Pozos et al., 2004; Hijnen & Medema, 2005). However, UV-A has also 42

Log10 CFU mL-1

been successfully applied to inactivate bacteria, and is subject to an increasing number of investigations into its sterilization efficiency (Mori et al., 2007; Yagi et al., 2007). As such, determining which setting on the lamp had the most efficient inactivation capacity for bacterial growth provided the foundation for continued UV experiments with the selected light source. From the images provided in Figures 9 and 10, it is clear that with the given light source, UV-C inhibits bacterial growth on agar plates. It is important to note that according to the USEPA, UV-C applications in continuous flow systems, such as the flowcell, are more complex than applications in mixed batch reactors (USEPA, 2006). It is possible that some cells would not receive the UV-C due to their orientation in the flowcell channel in relation to the UV-C source. As such, the UV-C application for continued experiments exceeded the USEPA recommendations for the treatment of potable water with regards to dose (7.7 ­ 259 mJ/cm2), with a dose delivered of 292 mJ/cm2.

3.3.5.2 UV-C Penetration through Borosilicate Glass Cover Slips All constructed community members were streak plated and subjected to 5 min UV-C exposure through two borosilicate glass cover slips. SD-1 is displayed in Figure 11. Constructed community members were spread plated and subjected to 5 min UV-C exposure through borosilicate glass slips. The results demonstrated that some penetration through the cover slips occurred. Both streak plates and spread plates were used to help determine the effectiveness of UVC penetration through the borosilicate slides. Streak plates often possess multiple layers of cells at their peak growth; therefore, inhibition of microbial growth through the borosilicate slides would indicate adequate penetration to apply the UV-C to a biofilm, which develops multiple layers. UV-C was applied immediately after streaking to determine whether UV-C was capable of inhibiting multi-layered cell growth. However, microbial growth was not inhibited on the streak plate, so a single cell-layered spread plate was tested. Conventional Plexiglass flowcells are traditionally covered with glass cover slips for ease of microbial attachment and performing microscopy (Bester et al., 2010). Upon further investigation it was verified that the specific composition of the glass significantly affects the % transmittance of UV light and subsequent penetration into the desired object. The glass cover slips originally affixed to the flowcell in this study were composed of borosilicate glass. Recognizing that there was incomplete penetration of UV-C onto the streak plate, but adequate penetration through the cover slip to inhibit bacterial growth on the spread plate, a third test was performed by fluence measurements obtained from a radiometer which showed that the % transmittance of the UV-C source employed in the current study through the borosilicate glass cover slips was 0.001%, rendering the borosilicate glass cover slips unfit to achieve the objectives outlined in this study.

Two borosilicate glass slides were suspended above the plate as drawn onto the plate in blue. 3.3.5.3 UV-C Penetration through Quartz Glass Cover Slips The ability of UV-C to penetrate quartz glass cover slips was demonstrated by the images in Figure 12, where A was the unexposed plate, and B was the UV-C exposed plate. Quartz glass sleeves are commonly used in wastewater treatment facilities employing UV disinfection as they have been shown to allow 90-95% transmittance of UV-C light (Harris et al., 1987). As such, quartz glass cover slips were tested with the UV-C light source used in the current study to ensure adequate transmittance and penetration of UV-C light occurred. Additionally, the quartz glass cover slips were tested with the radiometer and found to allow >99% transmittance.

3.3.5.4 Effect of UV-C on Planktonic Cultures The effectiveness of UV-C at inactivating planktonic bacteria cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp were quantified from biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1 ) (Fig. 13). The pre-culture possessed an average Log10 CFU mL-1 of 8.82. From the original culture a dilution of 1:10 (represented as the high concentration), and a 1:1000 (represented as the low concentration) were passed through the flowcell and subjected to UV-C exposure through quartz glass cover slips. Effluent samples were collected at 0.25 h and 1h. Log10 CFU mL-1 corresponded to biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield numbers originating from pure-culture biofilms (Bester et al., 2011). Residence time in the flowcell channel was determined to be 169 sec. The UV-C source was successful at inactivating planktonic bacteria of PA01. Inactivation in both planktonic cultures further solidifies the proof that the UV-C lamp is capable of transmittance through the quartz glass cover slips and penetrating cultures within the flowcell channels.

3.3.5.5 Determination of UV-C Exposure Time to a Steady-State Pure-Culture Biofilm The ability of biofilms to better withstand stress when compared to their planktonic counterparts is well documented. With the knowledge that bacterial inactivation in planktonic cultures occurred within 0.25 h of UV-C application, UV-C exposure times of 1.5 h and 2.0 h were tested for their effectiveness on a pure-culture biofilm (Fig. 14), as measured by carbon dioxide production (ppm). Observing less than a 10 ppm change from 1.5 ­ 2.0 h of UV-C, an application time of 1.5 h for future experiments was decided upon. Because the steady-state biofilms proved to resist UV-C application, it was decided upon to test the response of early stationary phase biofilms.

3.3.5.6 Effect of UV-C to Pure-Culture Biofilm in Early Stationary-phase The response of a 72 h Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp (PA01) biofilm to a 1.5 h UV-C exposure at 73 h, was measured by carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1) is shown in Fig. 15. Carbon dioxide production remained within a 4 ppm range after UV-C exposure until 96 h, but increased between 96 ­ 120 47

h. Biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield increased throughout the 120 h experiment despite UVC exposure. The PA01 biofilm response to the 1.5 h UV-C exposure is displayed in Fig. 16, as measured by carbon dioxide production (ppm). There was a decrease in carbon dioxide production from 73 ­ 73.5 h, when the biofilm carbon dioxide production then increased for the remainder of the UV-C exposure. The response of a 72 h SD-1 biofilm to a 1.5 h UV-C exposure at 73 h (Fig. 17), as measured by carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1), demonstrated that carbon dioxide production upon UVC exposure until 96 h remained static with less than a 1 ppm range between 72 ­ 96 h. Unlike, the PA01 biofilm whose carbon dioxide production increased by nearly 17 ppm from 96 ­ 120 h, the carbon dioxide production of the SD-1 biofilm remained within 4ppm of the pre-UV-C exposure value (72 h ). The carbon dioxide production (ppm) response (Fig.18) of the SD-1 biofilm during UV-C exposure resulted in a decrease of carbon dioxide production from 74 ­ 74.25h, when it then responded with continued vigour with carbon dioxide production that surpassed all previous recordings. The biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield from the SD-1 biofilm increased from 24 ­ 96 h, followed by a decrease to 120 h. The 24 h static carbon dioxide production rates in both pure-culture biofilms upon UV-C exposure suggests that UV-C affects biofilm metabolism for a period of time. With PA01 carbon dioxide production slightly increasing from 96 ­ 120 h, it seems the impact of UV-C causes only a short-term suppression in biofilm metabolism, whereas the SD-1 biofilm carbon dioxide production is stationary from 72 ­ 120 h, suggesting that the SD-1 biofilm is more susceptible to the UV-C. The ever increasing biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield from the PA01 biofilm further lends support to the notion that the biofilm is essentially unaffected by the UV-C exposure, with propagation strategies being unaffected by the imposed stress. Conversely, the SD-1 biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield, peaks at 96 h, followed by a decrease to near preUV-C exposure quantities, demonstrating a delayed effect from the UV-C exposure. With the observations obtained from monitoring the metabolic and cell yield effects of UV-C on a biofilm transitioning into less rapid growth, and concluding that the UV-C does not deter biofilm metabolism or cell yield, the implications of UV-C applications to systems known to house biofilms of varying maturity levels, which undoubtedly house biofilms more mature than 72 h, must be considered. Moreover, if UV-C is not effective on a relatively young biofilm, what can its efficacy be on mature biofilms? 48

3.3.5.7 Effect of UV-C on Actively Growing Pure-Culture Biofilms The response of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp (PA01) actively growing biofilm to UV-C exposure at 25 h (Fig. 19) was measured using carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1). Fig. 20 displays the PA01 biofilm carbon dioxide production during the 1.5 h UV-C exposure. The responses of a SD-1 actively growing biofilm to a 1.5 h UV-C exposure (Fig. 21) was measured using carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1), with the carbon dioxide production response (ppm) to 1.5 h UV-C displayed in Fig. 22. The effect of UV-C application on actively growing pure-culture biofilms was overall negligible as neither carbon dioxide production nor biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield demonstrated an observable impact from the UV-C application, as measured in their continued increases from 0 ­ 48 h. Although the 1.5 h UV-C exposure resulted in a decrease of 7 ppm from 25 ­ 25.5 h in the PA01 biofilm, and the carbon dioxide response of the SD-1 biofilm during UV-C was more dramatic with an immediate increase from 25 ­ 25.25 h, followed by decreased carbon dioxide production throughout the remaining 1.25 h. Overall, UV-C had no impact on deterring biofilm growth, as both CO2 and cell yields increased to quantities found in same species biofilms without UV-C, as confirmed from previous experimental data. Moving forward from examining the effects of UV-C on immature and relatively young (72 h) biofilms, determining whether UV-C has an impact on already stressed (carbon-starved) biofilm was the logical next step.

3.3.5.8 Effect of UV-C on a Carbon-Starved Actively Growing Biofilm Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp (PA01) (Fig. 23) biofilm responses (24 h carbon replete, 24 h carbon-starved, 1.5 h UV-C exposure and carbon reintroduction) were monitored by carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1). Carbon dioxide production increased during carbon-starvation (24 ­ 48 h), while biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield decreased. Each channel was exposed to 1.5 h UV-C at 48-50 h postinoculation. After exposure, carbon was reintroduced back into the media. The PA01 carbon dioxide production (ppm) during the reintroduction of carbon is displayed in Fig. 24, which demonstrated a decrease in overall carbon dioxide production. The SD-1 biofilm response (24 h carbon replete, 24 h carbon-starved, 1.5 h UV-C exposure and carbon reintroduction) (Fig. 25) were monitored by carbon dioxide production (ppm) and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield (Log10 CFU mL-1). The carbon dioxide production (ppm) of the SD-1 biofilm during the reintroduction of carbon (Fig. 26) decreased initially from 49 ­ 49.25 h, when it then remained virtually unchanged until 50 h. The carbon dioxide production (ppm) increased from 24 ­ 72 h with both pure-culture biofilms, while both pure-culture biofilms resulted in decreased biofilmderived planktonic cell yield under carbon-starvation conditions (24 ­ 48 h) with the PA01 cell yields increasing during carbon replete conditions (48 ­ 72 h). Conversely, the SD-1 biofilm measured a continued decrease in cell yield despite carbon being reintroduced back into the media. Of note, is that unlike previous induced carbon-starvation at times of 72 h, and 120 h, in the current study and performed by Bester et al.(2011), carbon-starvation induced at 24 h did not result in the biofilm returning to baseline carbon dioxide production levels. This response is to be further investigated. Both biofilms were affected by starvation at an early time period (24 h) as shown by nearly static carbon dioxide production (ppm), and decreased planktonic cell yield; however, PA01 rebounded with increased carbon dioxide production and planktonic cell yield, once again demonstrating that a 1.5 h UV-C application did not deter the biofilm with regards to metabolism and cell release. Conversely, the SD-1 biofilm released less cells with the combination of carbonstarvation and cell yield, leading one to postulate that overall SD-1 was more susceptible to the effects of UV-C, than the PA01by these measurement parameters.

54

The amalgamation of pure-culture biofilm responses to the effectiveness of UV-C exposure beginning with the inhibition of bacterial growth on solid agar, followed by achieving log inactivation in planktonic cultures, concluding with the ineffectiveness of UV-C at deterring biofilm growth in both 24 and 72 h biofilms, the efficiency of UV-C in larger-scale, industrial applications must be considered. UV-C is a physical disinfectant used in an increasing number of water treatment and wastewater decontamination regimes; however, the current study demonstrates that even slight amounts of biofilm growth (not visible to the naked eye) shield the UV-C from inactivating the bacteria, rendering it ineffective as a biofilm control treatment. Of interest is that biofilms in the current study, although constructed of organisms commonly found in DWDS, and / or hospital and domestic sink-drains, were relatively immature compared to biofilms found in the aforementioned environments, especially DWDS. DWDS are known to be colonized by a multitude of microorganisms, and house biofilms to the extent that pipelines and membranes can become blocked and restricted because of biofilm growth. Therefore, the observations obtained from the current study beg the question of how effective UV-C can be in water treatment regimes with regards to combating the effects of mature, well-established biofilms. To this point, only the SD-1 biofilm upon carbon-starvation and UV-C treatment demonstrated a continued decrease in planktonic cell yield. Biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield is a biofilm propagation strategy (Bester et al., 2011). As such, the perpetual cell yield throughout imposed carbon-starvation demonstrates that biofilm propagation, which may include pathogen dissemination, continues with vigour despite extended periods of nutrient deprivation. Knowing that biofilms are implicated as causative agents in a wide variety of nosocomial and infectious diseases, this proliferation and dissemination strategy clearly solidifies the biofilm stronghold in the role of persistent or chronic disease infections, whether the origin of the biofilm is in hospitals, homes, food processing centers or DWDS.

Chapter 4: Conclusions and Future Directions
This study showed that the metabolic and cell yield responses exhibited by mixed community biofilms to carbon-starvation are similar to those of pure culture Pseudomonas sp. CT07::gfp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 gfp biofilms, using carbon dioxide production and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield as measurement parameters. Further, the ability of UVC to inhibit bacterial growth on solid agar, and result in bacterial inactivation in planktonic cultures was demonstrated. However, UV-C was inept at deterring biofilm growth in 24 h, 72 h, and 24 h-carbon-starved pure-culture biofilms as measured by carbon dioxide production and biofilm-derived planktonic cell yield, despite delivered UV-C doses that exceeded the recommended range as put forward by the USEPA for potable water disinfection. Future work should include the use of CLSM and image analysis software to monitor the architectural changes of mixed community biofilms under carbon replete and deplete conditions. As the constructed mixed community originated from a sink-drain, subjecting the organisms to stressors other than nutrient deprivation, that are known to occur in sink-drain environments are suggested and include periods of high temperature representing hot water entering the drain, the response to natural cleaning products or disinfectants, and induced periods of desiccation. Further testing the responses of pure-culture biofilms to induced carbon-starvation is encouraged. Unlike previous experiments with carbon-starvation induced at 72 and 120 h, imposed carbon-starvation at 24 h resulted in a suppression of carbon dioxide production, not the previously observed return to baseline carbon dioxide production values. Investigating the responses of both pure-culture and mixed community biofilms to nitrogen and phosphorus starvation is suggested. The MSM used in this study was modified specifically to allow for the removal of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus as discrete components. Additional recommendations include the application of UV-C under turbulent flow conditions (Re > 2000), to test its efficiency at achieving bacterial inactivation, firstly in pureculture biofilms, and proceeding to mixed community biofilms. Of importance would be the application of UV-C to all constructed community members as pure-culture biofilms to determine whether some members are more susceptible than others to the effects of UV-C. If bacterial inactivation is achieved, the use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) 58

would be useful in tracing which community members are able to withstand the imposed stress and which are not. Of importance is demonstrating the direct effects of UV-C to a planktonic culture without being transmitted through a quartz glass cover slip. A pre ­culture could be vortexed briefly prior to use to ensure cells are planktonic and viable. Following this, a 96-well plate can be seeded with planktonic cells and exposed to varying times of UV-C. The fluorescence imparted by GFP could be measured with a plate reader to indicate the impact of UV-C on biomass. The background signal of MSM medium would need to be measured in addition to the half-life of the GFP protein to verify that the observed fluorescence is emitted from viable cells. If the test organism is not GFP-labelled, OD600 could be used to estimate bacterial density. In another approach, an overnight pre-culture could be inoculated into small Petri dishes (without lids), constantly agitated by sterile magnetic stirrers, treated with UV-C exposure of various times, and cell counts could be determined using serial dilutions and plating. Furthermore, development of a method for inducing carbon-starvation and measuring UV-C exposure is imperative for the analysis of biofilms at solid-air interfaces.

Appendix 1: Determination of the Reynolds number for the flowcell

For flow in a channel the Reynolds number is determined by Equation (E2)

where Re is Reynolds number, u is average velocity of the fluid, D is equivalent diameter of the channel, and v is kinematic viscosity. A kinematic viscosity for water at 20°C is 1.004 × 10-6 m2 s-1.

The velocity of the fluid was obtained from:

From Equation (E4) we obtained

Since flow rate (Q) value is given by the system configuration, the Reynolds number can be obtained as follows:

60

Thus, the Reynolds number at 20C is

Re = 1.03 which is a Laminar flow

61

Appendix 2: Determination of the Critical Dilution Rate for the flowcell
The critical dilution rate ( within the flowcell is calculated as the flow rate of medium (F) divided by the channel volume (V).

Appendix 3: Determination of UV-C Fluence (Dose)
y= 114976x where x is the actual radiometer recorded value, and y is mW/cm2 Radiometer Reading (1 cm) x = 1.5 x 10-2 Therefore, y = 114976 (1.5 x 10-2) = 1724.64 µW/cm2 = 1.725 x 10-3 W/cm2 = 1.725 mW/cm2

= (1.725 mW/cm2) * (169.4s) = 291.53 = 292 mJ/cm2

where I is the intensity (mW/cm2), and t is the exposure time (s).
