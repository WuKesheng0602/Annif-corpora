ABSTRACT
LASER SHADOWGRAPHY MEASUREMENT OF ABRASIVE PARTICLE MASS, SIZE AND VELOCITY DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGH MICRO-MASKS USED IN ABRASIVE JET MICRO-MACHINING

Master of Applied Science, Mechanical Engineering, 2011, Damon Dehnadfar Ryerson University

In abrasive jet micromachining (AJM), a jet of particles is passed through narrow mask openings in order to define the features to be micro-machined. The size and shape of the micromachined features depends on the distribution of the particle velocity and mass flux through the mask openings. In this work, a high speed laser shadowgraphy technique was used to

demonstrate experimentally, for the first time, the significant effect of the mask opening size and powder shape and size on the resulting distribution of particle mass flux and velocity through the mask opening. In particular, it was found that the velocity through the mask was approximately constant, but different in magnitude than the velocity in the free jet incident to the mask. The measured mass flux distributions were in excellent agreement with a previously developed analytical model, thus directly confirming its validity. Additional measurements also showed that an existing numerical model could be used to predict the velocity distribution in free jets of spherical particles, and, if a modification to the particle drag coefficient is made, in free jets of angular particles. The direct experimental verification of these models allow for their use in surface evolution models that can predict the evolving shape of features micro-machined using AJM. iii

CHAPTER 1 Introduction

1.1. Motivation

Abrasive jet micromachining (AJM) utilizes a jet of high speed particles to mechanically etch features such as micro-channels and micro-holes into glass, metal or polymeric substrates for use in micro-fluidic, micro-electromechanical (MEMS), and opto-electronic device fabrication. The jet of high speed impacting particles is usually passed through very narrow openings in a patterned erosion-resistant micro-mask which protects the substrate against particle impacts, thus defining the features to be machined (Fig. 1.1). The presence of the mask introduces a `mask edge' effect, i.e., a disturbance to the incoming particle mass flux that depends on the particle size distribution, since progressively smaller particles can pass through the mask opening as its edge is approached. The disturbance in flux and the distribution of particle velocities across the mask opening affect the size and shape of features machined using AJM; they are thus required as an input for analytical and computer models capable of predicting surface profile evolution [1-4].

There are very few previous studies of the velocity, size, and particle spatial distributions in free abrasive jets typical of those used in AJM, and there are no previous studies that measure these distributions through a narrow mask opening. Therefore, in order to predict the shape of the micro profiles, a clear understanding of the relationship between these parameters is required and this forms the objectives of this thesis. 1

Thesis Objective

The objectives of the thesis are to:

o Determine the particle size, velocity and spatial distributions in the free jet incident to the mask opening. The effect of particle mean diameter, shape and drag coefficient on velocity will also be determined.

o Determine the effect of the mask edge on the particle velocity, size and mass distribution through the mask opening by changing important parameters such as particle size, shape and mask opening width.

o Evaluate the existing model of Ref. [5] for prediction of the particle velocities in free jets, and verify the fit of the experimental data with the analytical model prediction of Ref. [6] for the masked case.

CHAPTER 2 Literature Review

2.1

Theoretical study of important parameters in abrasive jet machining

Most erosion models assume that plastic deformation and target material removal occur due to the energy transferred by the mass and velocity of the particles. The more massive the particles, the higher the kinetic energy they carry, assuming an equal density and velocity. Therefore, the effects of specific parameters such as particle size, particle shape, nozzle geometry, different air pressures and flow rates on the velocity profile of the free jet are important to study.

2.1.1

Effect of particle size in AJM

One of the most important parameters in AJM processing technology is particle size. Many researchers reported that the erosion rate decreases sharply with decreasing particle size, and it may even become zero at some non zero threshold particle size. For instance, Dundar et al. [7] reported a significant change in the amount of superficial damage as the particle size decreases. They showed that increasing the particle size from 2 to 25 Âµm results in a significant increase in kinetic energy of about 2000 times. The corresponding increase in damage associated with the plastic deformation of the substrate falls with decreasing particle size. Moreover, the particle size distribution has a large impact on the particle velocities in AJM. In general, the particle velocity decreases with increasing particle size for a given air flow rate [8]. The rate of decrease was 4   

found to depend on the abilities of particles to rearrange within the flow, which, in turn, depends on the particle's shape.

Prochasca et al. [8] analyzed the velocities of different sized particles within debris flows and reported that their velocities depended on the ability of individual particles to rearrange. Particle velocities decreased with increasing particle size as shown in Fig. 2.1[8].

Figure 2.1: Normalized particle velocity versus normalized particle size [8]

2.1.2 Effect of particle shape in AJM

Most of the previous development of analytical models focused on particles with a spherical shape [5, 9]. However, it has been found experimentally that there is a large difference in the measured erosion rates between angular and spherical particles having a similar particle

5   

size. For example, Liebhard and Levy [10] studied the effect of the erodent particle shape on the mass loss for four different diameter ranges of both spherical and angular particles. The results showed that the shape of particles is a major factor in establishing their ability to erode materials. As shown in Table 2.1, angular particles of the same particle size ranges generally are more erosive than spherical particles.

Table 2.1: Effect of particle shape on mass loss. The erosion tests were carried out on 1018 steel. The erodent particles were spherical glass beads and angular SiC of four different diameter ranges between 250 and 600Âµm. The particle velocities were 20 and 60 m/s [10]

Furthermore, many researchers have investigated the influence of particle shape on the drag coefficient and, consequently, the velocity evolution of particles in the air jet flow. There are many equations in the literature relating the drag coefficient CD to the Reynolds number Re of spherical particles, e.g., Clift et al. [11], Khan and Richardson [12], and Haider [13]. However, not many generalized expressions for CD vs. Re are available for non-spherical particles. Haider and Levenspiel [14] developed and presented such a correlation for non-

6   

spherical particles utilizing the concept of particle sphericity  to account for particle shape. Equation (4.1) will demonstrate the relation between these parameters.

2.1.3

Effect of nozzle geometry on velocity profile of free jet

Various experimental results in the literature have described significant differences in the erosion rates of the same sample materials tested under nominally identical conditions in different apparatuses. In 1986, Ruff [15] found that the nozzle geometry affects the erosion conditions in the apparatus. Moreover, according to ASTM G-76 standard [16] the inner diameter of the nozzle needs to be measured periodically, and the nozzle should be replaced before the diameter has enlarged by 10%. The experimental investigation of Lapides and Levy [17] on the erosion of ductile metal samples showed that using an internally rough, rather than smoothÂ­bored, nozzle in the test results in a smaller diameter of the primary eroded area on the substrate, all other conditions being the same. Shipway and Hutchings [18] also carried out a detailed examination of the influence of nozzle bore roughness on the erosion test conditions and noted that a rough nozzle bore is associated with a lower erodent velocity and a greater spread of velocities. They also found that the effects of nozzle geometry and internal roughness are more prominent for spherical particles than for angular particles, and it was proposed that this was due to differences in rebound behavior for the two types of particle. It is thus important to control not only the geometry of the nozzles but also the internal roughness in gas blast type apparatuses used in erosion testing.

2.2

Particle spatial distribution in jet

In an abrasive jet, the size of a particular jet cross-section varies with the standoff distance, h, reaching its maximum at the target surface. The spatial distribution of particles depends on a wide range of parameters including: nozzle geometry, dimensions, roughness, and particle shape and properties. Ciampini et al. [19] assumed that the particles travel outward in straight lines from the nozzle. Equation 2.1 introduced by Ciampini et al. describes the spatial distribution of particles exiting the nozzle at a distance r from the centerline:

r =  A
where

r rn

(2.1)



is the angle of exit with respect to the nozzle centerline (Fig. 2.2). This equation

implies that particles at the nozzle centerline leave on a path along the normal to the radial axis of the jet periphery, and particles on the outer edge of the nozzle leave at an angle equal to the divergence angle of the nozzle,  A .

Figure 2.2: Spatial distribution of abrasive particles with the standoff distance, h, from the substrate. 8   

Furthermore, Shipway and Hutchings [18] used rough nozzles in their erosion testing and reported that the particles were travelling at angles beyond a well-defined cone such as that shown in Fig. 2.2. However, it was also noted that the large majority of particles do travel within specific bounds of divergence for smooth nozzles. Thus, the simplified form of the stream divergence given in equation (2.1) may not be practical in all cases.

Li et al. [5] reported that the structure of the free particle flow is similar to the free pure air jet flow where there also exists a flow expansion. Apparently, the expansion angle  P of the particle flow is smaller than that of the air flow due to the larger density and momentum of the particles. Equation (2.2) presents the particle jet flow radius at an axial distance x with the expansion angle of particles assumed to be approximately  P = 7Âº [5].

rP = where:

dN  + x tan( P ) 2 2

(2.2)

 P : Expansion angle of abrasive particles in the air jet flow
d N : Nozzle diameter x: Distance from nozzle exit along the jet axis

The spatial distribution of particles within the jet emanating from a round nozzle was measured in Ref. [3], using a particle collection technique. In this technique, particles launched from the nozzle were collected at various radial distances, using a tungsten carbide cylinder connected to a nylon tube. Ghobeity et al. [3] compared two probability of particle mass flux distributions, the gamma and Weibull distributions, and chose the Weibull distribution function,
9   

P(r), as the best fit to match the experimental data. It has been found that for the conditions encountered in AJM operations, the probability of a particle arriving at the target surface in a radial hoop between r and r+dr (Fig. 2.3) could be expressed as equation (2.3) with a scale parameter of h

(2.3)

where h is the standoff distance from the nozzle tip and  is an experimentally determined jet focus coefficient.

In order to predict the surface evolution in AJM, Ciampini et al. [20] used the same probability distribution function of equation (2.3) in their simulation. The particles were considered in a plane which was perpendicular to the jet centerline and the angle  in Fig. 2.3 was assumed to be a uniform random number on the interval (0, 2].

2.3

Particle velocity and its effect on erosion

Velocity is a critical test variable in erosion. It can easily overshadow changes in other variables such as target material, impact angle, etc. Most researchers use a power law to describe the effect of velocity on erosion rate, as follows

E = kV n

(2.4)

where E is the erosion rate, V is the particle velocity, k is a constant, and n has values between 2 and 3.5 for metallic materials. Brittle materials tend to have a larger n range, from 2 to 6.5 [21]. Hence, the velocity exponent n was found to depend on the properties of the target material and the erodent particle, and it is usually governed by test conditions.

Balasubramaniam et al. [22] studied the effect of particle velocity in AJM. Comparison of the normalized erosion profiles for various jet centre line velocities showed that the particle velocity has a very strong influence on erosion rates of materials. For example, the normalized erosion profile at V0 = 50 m/s appeared to be almost flat but it was much steeper at V0 = 150 m/s. Therefore, the importance of an accurate knowledge of particle velocity is self evident.

11   

2.3.1

Particle velocity distribution in jet

A considerable amount of experimental work to determine the particle velocities and distributions in particle-laden gas jets has been reported in the literature. For example, Stevenson and Hutchings [23] experimentally investigated the relationship between particle velocity and operating conditions in a gas blast system typically used in solid particle erosion testing. They employed two different methods to measure the exit velocities of the erodent particles: the double disc method of Ruff and Ives [24] and an opto-electronic method similar to that of Kosel and Anand [25]. Section 2.6 will discuss these different methods of measurement in detail. These studies, however, involved blasting on a larger scale, and there are relatively few studies of free jets for the relatively small nozzles, pressures and particles typically used in AJM systems.

Some researchers have shown that the particle velocity distribution across the jet is linear. For example, Ghobeity et al. [3] measured the velocity distribution of 25Âµm aluminum oxide across an abrasive jet using a round 0.76mm nozzle with the aid of a Phase-Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) and inferred an approximately linearly decreasing velocity from the center to the periphery of the jet (Fig. 2.4).

  Figure 2.4: Measured velocity distribution of 25Âµm Al2O3 from nozzle axis at 200 kPa, 20mm from nozzle exit [3]  

An earlier study by Balasubramania et al. [22] also showed a linear relation for velocity distribution of the particles as follows:

Vr = (V1 - V0 )(r / R) + V0 where: V0 : the maximum velocity of the incoming particle Vr : the velocity of the incoming particle at any radial position of the jet V1 : the velocity at the periphery of the jet R: the radius of the jet r: The radius at any point with the jet
13   

(2.5)

On the other hand, Burzynski and Papini [26] presented experimental techniques to measure the particle spatial and velocity distribution along the micro-abrasive jet and the result for velocity distribution demonstrated a linear or nonlinear velocity distribution depending on the particle type and the nozzle diameter. Achtsnick et al. [27] also developed a one dimensional isentropic flow model to calculate the particle exit velocity of each individual particle in the airflow for a converging cylindrical and a line shaped Laval-type nozzle. Particle velocity measurements using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) method showed a bell-shaped profile along the radial axis for the cylindrical nozzle. The velocity profile for the Laval nozzle showed a more uniform profile with a relatively flat bottom.

In the most recent work, Li et al. [5] developed a mathematical free jet model to determine the particle velocity at a given axial and radial location within an abrasive air jet flow typical of AJM. They found that their model had acceptable agreement with velocity

measurements they performed using PIV. The model is such that the particle velocities at the nozzle exit are determined based on the nozzle length, particle mean diameter, particle density, air density and air flow velocity and particle drag coefficient. Fig. 2.5 showed the structure of abrasive-air jet flow in free jet. The distribution of particle velocities along the jet centerline downstream from the nozzle and the particle velocity profile at a jet cross-section were also modeled considering surrounding air entrainment and air-particle interaction.

14   

Figure 2.5: Structure of abrasive-air jet flow in free jet

In this model the axial distance from the nozzle exit downstream is separated into a series of identical segments with a length of LS and the centerline particle velocity in the free jet was developed using

2  2 3 LS CD  A 2 Â± - vPi = vPi v v ( ) A- x Pi -1 -1  2 dP P  

1

(2.6)

where: vPi : Particle velocity at the end point of the ith segment of the nozzle vPi -1 : Particle velocity at the start point of the ith segment of the nozzle
15   

Ls : Length of discretizing nozzle segment CD : Particle drag coefficient

 A : Air density at nozzle cross section
d P : Mean particle diameter

 P : Density of abrasive particle
v A- x : Centre line velocity of air flow at an axial distance x from nozzle exit

In order to use the equation (2.6), the velocity of air at the centerline of the free jet was compared with particle velocity at the same location of the ith segment. If the air velocity is greater than particle velocity, the air flow provides a dragging force to accelerate the particle. So, the positive sign is introduced in equation (2.6). However, the negative sign was used when the particle velocity became higher than the air velocity of the same segment.

Furthermore, Li et al. [5] also assumed a velocity distribution along the jet radial axis as
    r v p = v p 0 exp  - ln 2  d    N + 100d N tan A   2 2      
2

where: rP = d N / 2 + x tan( P / 2)

vP : Particle velocity at (x, y) position from the nozzle tip vP 0 : Particle velocity at the nozzle center line with an axial distance x from nozzle exit
16   

 P : Expansion angle of abrasive air jet flow
d N : Nozzle diameter
x : Distance from nozzle exit in jet flow direction

The variation of particle flow velocity with radial distance, r, at different jet downstream sections can be calculated by using this method. Li et al.'s model predicts a Gaussian or bell shape velocity profile along the radial axis for different standoff distances from the nozzle tip, consistent with the model of [27].

2.4

Effect of mask edge on the surface profile of features machined using AJM

The size and shape of the micro-machined features depends on the distribution of the particle velocity and mass flux through the mask openings. However, the presence of the mask introduces a `mask edge' effect. Several different approaches have been used to model this mask edge effect, but it has never been measured. For example, the analytical surface evolution model of ten Thjie Boonkkamp and Jansen [1] relates the instantaneous surface slope to the local brittle erosion rate through the normal velocity component. Their model approximates the disturbance to the incoming particle flux caused by particle collisions with the mask edge as a linear decrease in flux as the mask edge is approached. Slikkerveer and in`t Veld [2] developed a similar surface evolution model but considered the particles to be infinitely small so that the mask edge effect was not considered. Ghobeity et al. [3] modified the model of ten Thjie Boonkkamp and Jansen [1], introducing a semi-empirical method that utilized the measurement of a shallow first pass
17   

profile to infer the mask edge effect. When incorporated in the surface evolution model of ten Thjie Boonkkamp and Jansen [1], this more accurate account of the decreased flux at the mask edge resulted in a better prediction of the etched feature depth and shape.

Ghobeity et al. [28] also developed a computer particle tracking simulation that modeled the ricochet and second strike of spherical particles off the edge of a hardened steel mask edge in order to estimate the effective particle mass flux through the mask opening. In a more recent work, Ghobeity et al. [6] developed an analytical model that was able to predict the mask edge effect as a function of particle size distribution (see Section 4.4.2). This model has also been recently adopted with good success by Burzynski and Papini [29] in their level-set based surface evolution model of AJM.

Yagyu and Tabata [30] developed a cellular automaton model for AJM that incorporated a mask. This model utilized a representation of particle flux that was similar to a continuum, rather than tracking individual particles, and therefore it could not model the effect of particle size distribution and particle-to-mask interaction effects. Ciampini et al. [20] presented an improved particle-tracking and cellular automaton-based approach that could simultaneously account for effects such as second-strike, spatial hindering, and particle size/edge effects. It provided greatly improved predictions of surface evolution, especially for high aspect ratio features.

2.5

Introduction to different methods of measuring the particle size distribution

The abrasive particles used in AJM are not all of the same size, and they usually vary in shape. Idealized solid particles have generally been described as spherical, rod or disk shaped. However, in order to simplify the measurement, the particles are usually assumed to be spherical [5, 6]. Since the particle size may vary over quite a wide range, it is normal to break the range up into different bin sizes, and measure the number of particles that are in each size bin to form a particle size distribution (PSD) that can be represented in the form of a histogram (Fig. 2.6).

  Figure 2.6: Particle diameter histogram for 25 Âµm aluminum oxide powder measured using shadowgraphy

19   

Scientists and engineers have developed a number of different methods for particle size measurement in recent years, which will be now reviewed.

2.5.1

Laser diffraction

Laser diffraction is one of the most widely used techniques to analyze the particle sizes in many applications including manufacturing, quality control and product development. This method is a preferred method in industry since it can continuously measure a wide range of particle sizes. In this method, the particles passing through a laser beam scatter light at an angle that is correlated to their size. The laser diffraction particle size analyzer measures the particle sizes by multiple light detectors and the number of detectors increases the sensitivity and size limits of this method [31]. This method has been used by many researchers to investigate the size of particles having various shapes. Kippax [32] has reviewed some of the advantages of using laser diffraction for particle sizing including repeatability, ease of verification, and speed of measurement.

Traditional methods such as laser diffraction, although highly efficient, give limited information on particle shape. Image analysis may thus be a better tool for performing particle analysis.

20   

2.5.2 Measurement using Image Analysis

In industry, it is sometimes necessary to also characterize particle shape in addition to particle size, to gain a better understanding of how shape can affect the various properties of a product. Visual inspection (microscopy or image analysis) is the most straightforward measurement technique and is increasingly being recognized as one of the most reliable techniques to characterize particle shape, size and volume distribution.

Visual-based systems use an automated image analysis solution that combines particle characterization software with an automated microscope and high resolution camera. Before the analysis begins, particles need to be placed on a motorized stage for inspection. To extract the needed data and related statistical results from the software, a pre-established or custom designed image analysis routine executes a list of procedures to the images. A standard routine includes three distinct categories of instructions: image acquisition, processing, and measurement [33].

The image analysis method can be combined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to perform small particle analysis. This method has been used in many works since it is an easy and straight forward measurement. For example, Ghobeity et al. [6] used a commercial optical particle sizing system to characterize the abrasive powders and measure important parameters such as particle mean size, standard deviation, aspect ratio and the equivalent spherical diameter. The size distribution results of their experiments confirmed the accuracy and repeatability of this method for various range of aluminum oxide sizes.

Introduction to different methods of measuring the particle velocity

Studies of erosive wear by solid particle impingement require a measurement of particle velocity and sometimes the angle of incidence. The most important methods used for particle velocimetry will now be reviewed.

2.6.1 Double disc technique of Ruff and Ives

In 1975, Ruff and Ives introduced a method to measure the particle velocity that consists of a pair of metal disks (A and B) mounted on an ordinary shaft and caused to rotate in front of the gas-particle jet. A single radial slot in disk B allows particles to pass through the opening and leave a mark on disk A. A pair of erosion scars is produced on disk A, one with the disks at a standstill and the other while the disks is rotating with a known and constant velocity [24].

Measurement of the angular displacement between those marks determines the time-offlight of the particles as they cross the space between the disks. The average velocity over the distance can be determined using: U= 2 rvL S (2.8)

where L is the separation distance between two disks, U is the average particle velocity, v is the disk rotational velocity and S is a linear displacement of the two marks at a radius r from the disk center.

22   

Ruff and Ives [24] applied this method of particle velocity measurement to three different erosion testing apparatus with satisfactory results. One of the apparatuses was a commercial airabrasive jet device that feeds the abrasive particles through a flexible tube passing through a 0.5 mm nozzle diameter. They measured the particle velocity values from a particular nozzle design for different gas pressures at 3.5 cm standoff from the nozzle tip and reported the particle velocity increases by increasing the gas pressure. In addition, they repeated their measurements for different working distances at 310 kPa gas pressure and showed that the particle velocity decreases with increasing distance from the nozzle tip [24]. It was also noted by Ruff and Ives that the difference between the measured gas and particle velocities is about a factor of 3. Table 2.2 demonstrated the variance and changes in particle and gas velocities for three ranges of gas pressures. The particle velocity measurements using equation (2.8) were found to have a precision of about 10%.

Gas pressure (psig) 25 35 45 (kPa) 170 240 310

Gas velocity (m/s) 245 305 370

Particle velocity (m/s) 71 80 88

and gas velocity in a commercial erosion apparatus at different pressures [24]

23   

2.6.2 Laser Doppler velocimetery (LDV)

A technique for obtaining spatial resolution within LDV measurement volumes was developed by Czarske [34] and subsequently improved by Czarske et al [35]. The LDV technique has the potential for a wide range of measurements at high spatial resolutions. This technique can be used to measure a given component of velocity by passing the particles through the intersection of two collimated and coherent laser beams [40]. The interference of two beams generates a set of straight fringes at the focal point of the laser beam. Thus, the particles passing through the fringes reflect light into a photo detector and, consequently, the velocity can be calculated from the frequency of signals receiving at the detector. Argon ion and helium-neon lasers are the most common light sources that can be used in LDV. To enhance the capabilities of LDV for multi-position measurements, sub-measurement volume position resolution techniques have been developed [34-39].It should be noted that velocity measurements using this method require other expensive equipment including a photo detector and an optical arrangement for laser beam splitting and focusing.

Lowe and Simpson [40] developed an advanced LDV measurement technique to determine the particle position and velocity within a turbulent flow. They extend the basic LDV method to obtain three dimensional particle velocities with respect to their position in the air flow. This new method of LDV enabled researchers to obtain better estimates of particle velocities near the boundary layer in a variety of flows with relatively high Reynolds numbers.

24   

2.6.3 Phase-Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA)

The phase Doppler method is based on the principles of laser induced light scattering interferometry. Measurements are made at a small, non-intrusive optical probe volume defined by the intersection of two laser beams, similar to LDV. As a particle passes through the probe volume, the light is split from the beams and projected onto several detectors. The phase shift between the Doppler burst signals from different detectors is proportional to the size of the spherical particles. The phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA) method provides an accurate and reliable flow velocity and particle size data over a broad range of measurement situations.

In contrast to LDV, PDPA measurements are not based upon the scattered light intensity. The method thus does not suffer from typical errors of beam attenuation or deflection that can occur in higher dense particle flows. Moreover, Lee and Liu [41] noted that this method requires no calibration since the measurements are dependent only on the laser wavelength and optical configuration. However, the phase Droppler method is limited to spherical particles and it does not work for non-uniform geometries.

Ghobeity et al. [3] used the PDPA method to measure the particle velocity in a typical abrasive jet. The measurements made on particles passing through an ellipsoidal measurement volume and determined the actual particle velocities with components parallel and normal to the jet axis. The result of this measurements showed a linear velocity distribution across the jet and the comparison with the earlier measurement by Ref. [42] confirm the validity and reliability of the method.

25   

2.6.4 Particle Image Velocimetery (PIV)

The development of particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)technique, which allows measurement of the velocity information of the whole flow field in fractions of a second, began in the 1980's. [43].

In a PIV system, a laser generates a thin light sheet inside the air-particle flow. With a pulsed laser, a high speed camera acquires two consecutive images of the particles in flight (Fig. 2.7). With the known laser pulse duration and the calibrated scaling factor of the camera, the particle velocity can be calculated by analyzing the pairs of images. The method has been used by many and has proven to give accurate measurements of particle velocity [5].

Figure 2.7: Schematic diagram of PIV experimental setup

26   

For example, Li et al. [5] used the PIV method for two different nozzle sizes under different air pressures to compare their models with particle velocity measurements in the abrasive-air free jet experiments. They reported that the model predicted velocities and the corresponding experimental results are in good agreement with less than 4% average error. For instance, a statistical analysis showed that for a 0.36 mm nozzle, the average percentage deviation of the calculated velocity from the corresponding experimental data was 2.11% with a standard deviation of 3.62 m/s.

2.6.5 Particle Tracking Velocimetery (PTV)

Particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is a direct descendent of flow visualization using tracer particles in fluid flows. Here, the particles are illuminated by two successive bursts of a laser beam, each particle producing two images on the same piece of film, similar to in the PIV method. However, PTV performs better than PIV when the particle density is relatively low in the flow, i.e., when the inter-particle distance is large compared to the displacement of the same particle between exposures. Under this condition, the probability that two neighboring images belong to the same particle is higher, and this will avoid any ambiguity on matching pairs of particles [44].

27   

In contrast to PIV, PTV does not compute any vector in the empty space and the velocity vector is not computed unless a valid particle is located that area. Consequently, the uncertainty of the obtained particle velocity vector in the air jet flow by the PTV method is lower than for the PIV method.

Burzynski and Papini [26] also used the PTV method to assess the validity of their measurements, and it was reported that, for the majority of cases, their presented technique matched the PTV results quite well.

2.6.6 Shadow Imaging

Many industrial processes such as waste water treatment or electrochemical processes deal with gas bubbles. For the design and optimization of the equipment, it is important to study the influence of the gas bubbles on the fluid flow and mass transport in a quantitative way. A typical method for such measurements is backlighting or shadowgraphy where the bubble is illuminated by a diffuse light source and its shadow is imaged. For instance, Sathe et al. [45] reported measurement of the shape, size, velocity and acceleration of bubbles using shadowgraphy. Measurements were performed in a narrow rectangular column at moderate gas hold-up (5%) with a wide variation of bubble sizes (0.1Â­ 15mm). Since the shadowgraphy technique is independent of the shape and material (either transparent or opaque), it can be also used to measure the particle size and velocity distribution in the abrasive jets used in AJM technology.
28   

The technique is based on high resolution imaging with pulsed backlight illumination with a laser diffuser attached to the light source. Essentially, the particles in the focal plane block the light incident to the camera and thus appear dark against the light background of the source. Using a doublepulse light source and a doubleframe camera, it is possible to evaluate the velocities of the individual particles. In contrast to PIV, the shadowgraphy method gives simultaneous information about particle velocity distribution and the particle size data [46].

The shadowgraphy method was used in this thesis to measure the particle size and velocity of various particles in a free jet and through masks used in AJM. Section 3.2 describes the utilized shadowgraphy setup in more in detail.

29   

CHAPTER 3 Experiments
This chapter describes the experimental apparatus and methodology used to measure the velocity, spatial and size distribution of abrasive powders in both free jet and masked cases.

3.1.

Experimental Apparatus

Shadowgraphy measurements of particle velocity, size, and spatial distribution were performed on both free jets and on particles passing through mask openings, using the setup shown in Fig. 3.1. All experiments were performed using an Accuflo (Comco Inc., Burbank, CA, USA) micro-abrasive blaster with a round 0.76 mm inner diameter nozzle (high performance nozzle MB1520-11, Comco Inc., Burbank, CA, USA), at various blasting pressures. For the free jet experiments, the measurements were taken at a 20 mm distance from the nozzle exit.

Figure 3.1: Experimental apparatus  30   

A commercial optical particle sizing system (Clemex PS3 Research System, Clemex Technologies Inc., Longueuil, Quebec, Canada) was used to characterize the sphericity of the powders from shadowgraphy images. The properties of the utilized abrasive particles and the abrasive jet process parameters are provided in Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.

Table 3.3: Process parameters for measurements in mask openings 

As shown in Fig. 3.1, in order to protect the shadowgraphy equipment from dust, the nozzle was placed inside a clear test chamber, open on one end, and with a vacuum tube fed to a dust collector on the other end. The vacuum was sufficiently weak, and the distance from the measurement area sufficiently large, that the measurements were not affected by its presence. For the measurements through the mask openings, two 0.91 mm thick hardened steel strips of the type typically used in AJM experiments [3, 4] were placed at prescribed distances apart and parallel to each other, in order to define the mask opening. The steel strips were milled to give sharp 90Â° edges to sharply define the unmasked region. The masks were clamped to the mask holder shown in Fig. 3.2, which consisted of a steel support attached to a linear stage, allowing for the mask opening to be set with a precision of 2.5 Âµm. The mask holder had a rectangular opening allowing for a line of sight into the region between the mask edges.

32   

  Figure 3.2: Schematic of the mask holder

The nozzle was installed on a series of linear stages with 3 degrees of freedom that allowed precise alignment of the nozzle centerline to the mask opening in micron scale, and varying the nozzle to mask stand-off distance. The rotary stage at the bottom of the mask holder had a rotation range of 360Â° and a resolution of 1 arcmin, allowing for varying the angle of incidence of the nozzle with respect to the mask. The nozzle was always oriented such that the

33   

particle jet was incident perpendicular to the mask opening at a constant standoff distance of 20 mm in this work.

3.2.

Measurement of powder velocity, spatial and size distribution using shadowgraphy

Shadowgraphy measurements of particle velocity, spatial and size distribution were performed using a double pulsed frequency-doubled Nd: YAG (neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet) laser, producing up to 0.3 joules/pulse pair, for a repetition rate of 1000 Hz, which was passed through a high efficiency diffuser (diffuser with dye plate, Item No.: 1108417, Lavision GmbH, Goettingen, Germany), and placed directly opposite a high speed CCD camera (Imager Pro PlusX, Lavision GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) with a high magnification zoom lens (Navitar zoom 12x, Navitar Inc., Rochester, New York, USA), as shown in Fig. 3.1. Resolution of the camera was 1600x1200 pixels with the pixel size of 7.4x7.4 ÂµmÂ². The abrasive jet was incident in a plane parallel to the camera lens. The optics of the camera were such that the depth of focus defined the plane of particles on which the measurement were made. Using the highest lens magnification for the masked cases, the depth of focus was 0.05 mm within the mask opening, and this value was slightly larger due to the lower magnification of the lens in the free jet case (Appendix B). This focal plane was aligned to the centerline of the abrasive jet, so that measurements were made on a plane of particles across the jet (free jet measurements) or mask opening width (measurements through mask), as indicated in Fig. 3.3.

34   

  Figure 3.3: Setup for shadowgraphy experiments through masks.

Plane on which

measurements were made is indicated. For the free jet experiments, the setup was identical, but without the mask plates.

In this configuration, the particles in the focal plane blocked the light incident to the camera, and thus appeared dark against the light background of the source, as shown, for example, in Fig. 3.4. The laser was capable of producing two pulses of 1 ns duration, so that two successive images of the particles in flight could be obtained by the doubleframe CCD camera which was synchronized to the laser pulses. Depending on the flow velocity and the factor of magnification of the camera lens, the delay between the two pulses was chosen to be between 1 to 3 Âµs. Computer software (Davis software, Lavision GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) was used to

35   

process and analyze the images and subsequently evaluate the sizes and velocities of the individual particles.

Figure 3.4: Typical shadowgraphy pictures of particles in flight: (a) 50Âµm aluminum oxide particles and (b) 50Âµm glass beads 36   

To size the particles, a thresholding two step segmentation algorithm was applied to the images. The first segmentation located the particles in a so-called bounding box, and in the second step these segmentations were analyzed separately for size, shape and position. After all source images were analyzed, the velocity was calculated based on the two result lists. To identify pairs of particles, the algorithm had two conditions, i.e. the size and the allowed shift. As shown in Figure 3.5, the initial shift defined the centre position of the window in which particles were accepted. Particles were only accepted if the diameter deviation was within a preset range. This range was set to be +/- 15% for all experiments in Davis software. As a rule of thumb, the shift was at least 3 pixel and about half the size of the smallest particle to avoid ambiguities during the velocity calculation [46].

  Figure 3.5: Illustration of interrogation window for determination of particle velocities

37   

The number of particles passing through the mask opening depended on the particle size, the particle mass flow rate, and mask opening width. For conditions typical of AJM, there are relatively few particles in the opening at any given time. Nevertheless, it was very important to have a sufficiently large number of sampled images of particles in the focal plane of the shadowgraphy system in order to obtain a statistically reliable and repeatable particle size and velocity distribution. This was also complicated by the possibility of abrasive particles eroding the mask sidewalls and potentially affecting the particles' positions near the mask edges during the measurement period. For very thin masks that can rapidly wear all the way though their thickness, this might also change the effective mask opening width. The solid particle erosion of the steel mask depends on many factors such as material hardness, particle velocity, material, size and shape etc. For example, the erosion rate using angular particles is much higher than for spherical particles having a similar size [47]. Since in the present work, the variation in size distribution for angular particles was much broader than for spherical particles (Section 4.2), this further complicates matters. For these reasons, it was very important to experimentally determine the largest number of images that could be captured before the plates were significantly eroded.

By trial-and-error, it was found that approximately 3000 and 6000 double-frame images could be taken when using angular and spherical particles, respectively, before the mask erosion became significant. The average number of particles detected in the focal plane within the mask opening for each experiment was approximately 32500, or an average of approximately 5 particles per image. The average particle velocities measured from 1500 and 3000 shadowgraphy images of the angular aluminum oxide particles in flight inside the mask opening were within 5% of each other. This confirmed that the repeatability of the measurements was adequate using

38   

this number of frames. After analyzing a sufficient number of images, averages of the values such as particle velocity, size and mass were calculated in each particular bin. The bin sizes were varied for free jet and masked experiments based on the lens magnification and the number of the particles detected at certain positions in front of the camera.

CHAPTER 4 Measurements of particle spatial, velocity and size distributions

4.1.

Velocity distribution of abrasive particles

Surface evolution models of abrasive jet machining require the distribution of particle velocities across the abrasive jet, or mask opening. This is because the erosion rates (i.e., mass of target material removed per mass of incident abrasive) of materials have a power law dependency on the particle impact velocity, with a velocity exponent that is often greater than 2 [48]. As mentioned in Section 2.3, Li et al [5] developed a mathematical free jet model to determine the particle velocity in a given axial and radial location within an abrasive air jet flow. However, the velocity of the particles inside the mask opening has never been measured before. In the present work, particle velocity distribution measurements were made in both the free jet and through the mask opening, for the same flow conditions (Tables 3.2 and 3.3), so that the disturbance in particle velocity brought about by the mask could be determined.

4.1.1. Velocity in Free Jet Incident to Mask and Comparison to Model of Li et al. [5]

The particle velocities across the free jet at a distance of 20 mm from the nozzle exit were measured and compared to the model of Li et al [5], which required knowledge of the nozzle diameter and length, particle mean diameter, particle density, air density, air flow velocity and particle drag coefficient. A Maple code was written to be able to calculate the air and particle velocities along the radial axis of the free jet model presented by Ref. [5] (Appendix C).
40   

The process parameters for the free jet experiments are provided in Table 3.2. The model predicted a Gaussian or bell shape velocity profile across the jet with a maximum particle velocity at the jet center. Figs. 4.1 and 4.2 show that the predictions of Li et al.'s model [5], using the nominal diameters quoted by the manufacturer given in Table 3.1, fit the measured velocity distributions quite well for spherical particles Experiment #4a

42   

Use of the average diameters measured by shadowgraphy (Section 4.2) in the model resulted in very similar results. For the angular particles, the model of Li et al. [5] significantly under-predicted the measured particle velocity distribution, as shown in Figs. 4.3 to 4.6. The reason for this is that the particle drag coefficient that Li et al. assumed was for spherical particles. The changes in momentum and velocity of the particles depend strongly on their drag coefficients, which themselves, if the particles are non-spherical, strongly depend on the particle shape and orientation. Therefore, the following relationship for the drag coefficient, CD , suggested by Haider and Levenspiel [14], was introduced into the model of Li et al.:

CD =

24 73.69 Re exp(-5.0748 ) [1 + [8.1716 exp(-4.0655 )] Ã Re(0.0964+ 0.5565 ) ] + Re Re + 5.378 exp(6.2122 )

(4.1)

where Re < 2.6 Ã 105 is the particle relative Reynolds number and  is the sphericity of the

particles. Since particles experience a higher drag force as they become less spherical, the particle velocity increases with decreasing . The particle relative Reynolds number is given by [49]

where Ap is the measured particle surface area, and As is the surface area of a sphere with the same volume as the particle. The average sphericities of the powders given in Table 3.1 were measured using the shadowgraphic images (see similar sizing procedure in Section 4.2) and used in equation (4.1) to modify the drag coefficient in the model of Li et al. With this modification of the drag coefficient, Figs. 4.1 to 4.6 show that there was excellent agreement with the measured velocities for the spherical and non-spherical particles.

Comparing Figs. 4.1 and 4.3 for spherical and angular 50 Âµm glass media or Figs. 4.2 and 4.4 for spherical and angular 50Âµm stainless steel particles demonstrates that, as expected, the particle velocity was higher for angular than for spherical particles. For example, the magnitude of the particle velocity at the center of the jet for the 50 micron crushed glass with =0.80 was measured to be 140 m/s (Fig. 4.3), while the velocity of 50 micron glass beads with =1 was approximately 115m/s (Fig. 4.1).

4.1.2. Particle velocity distribution through the mask opening

The ratio of the mask opening width to the jet spot size in AJM applications is typically less than 0.1, as reflected in the mask opening width (0.5 mm) and the jet spot size at a 20 mm standoff from the nozzle tip (5-6 mm) used in the present experiments. Therefore, one would expect that the particle velocity across the narrow mask opening should be approximately uniform at its value at the jet centre in Figs. 4.1 to 4.6. However, the disturbance of the particle flow due to the presence of the mask and the particle ricochet from the mask edges and sidewalls has never been measured. All previously utilized AJM models have thus assumed these disturbances in particle velocity to be negligible. Figs. 4.7 to 4.10 show the measured velocity distributions inside the mask opening for the different abrasive particles, corresponding to the experiments in Table 3.3. For the relatively thick mask plates (i.e., ratio of the mask thickness to the mask opening ~0.5) used in the present study, the velocity distribution is approximately uniform inside the mask opening, consistent with what has been typically assumed in surface

49   

evolution models. However, as can be seen by comparing the free jet centerline velocities (Figs. 4.1 to 4.6) to the velocities through the mask (Fig. 4.7 to 4.10) under identical conditions, the velocities through the mask are significantly lower than those in the free jet. For example, for both spherical and non-spherical stainless steel particles of similar size, the average velocity through the masks (Figs. 4.7 and 4.8) was approximately 25m/s lower than the centerline velocities in the free jet (Figs. 4.2 and 4.4), under otherwise identical blasting conditions. Comparison of Figs. 4.6 and 4.10 shows that this effect was even more significant for the 25m aluminum oxide.

Figure 4.11 shows the measured velocity vectors of the individual particles, where the vector length corresponds to the particle velocity magnitude at a certain position inside the mask opening. It is evident that the particle velocity magnitudes of most of the rebounding particles are much lower than those of the non-rebounding particles. Hence, the effect of particle ricochet from the mask edges and sidewalls was minimum, as was also demonstrated under similar conditions in the particle tracking simulations of Ref. [28].

4.2. Particle size distribution in the free jet

The abrasive size distribution generally affects the particle mass flux, and, in turn, the erosion rate during AJM. Earlier studies of masked AJM have demonstrated that the particle size distribution can also greatly affect the shape and depth of micro-channel profiles [6]. However, in these previous studies, a microscope and image analysis system was used to measure samples of abrasive particles lying stationary on a flat plate. Such a methodology may suffer from a bias related to the tendency of particles to lie with their shortest axis normal to the surface, thus skewing the sizing result. This is especially true for flaky particles that are much larger in one dimension than the other two. In the present work, the particle size distributions and parameters such as the mean size and equivalent spherical diameter of angular particles were measured using shadowgraphy while the particles were in flight, allowing for a more random orientation of particles, thus reducing this bias. Using the Lavision Davis 7.2.2 software, the equivalent area spherical diameters of the particles were measured from the shadowgraphy images. For each particle in the shadowgraphy images, the longest and shortest axes were measured. The corresponding equivalent area spherical diameter was computed assuming the particle to be a circle with an area equivalent to that from that in the shadowgraphy image, using [51]:

-1  2 d P = (l / 2) 1 +  s s 2 - 1  ln  s + s 2 - 1

(4.4)

where l is major (longest) axis, t is minor (shortest) axis and s=l/t >1 is the axial ratio for each cases.

55   

Figs. 4.12 and 4.13 show that normal, and log-normal distributions best fit the measured equivalent particle radius distributions for spherical and angular particles, respectively. The size distributions of spherical particles were more uniform than those of the angular particles, and, in some cases, the average particle size calculated using shadowgraphy differed from the nominal particle size quoted by the manufacturer (Table 3.1). It should also be noted that no correlation of particle size with position in the free jet was found, i.e., all particle sizes had an equal probability of being found at a particular location within the jet.

4.3. Particle size distribution within the mask opening

The distribution of the particle sizes inside the mask opening is very important to study since it directly affects the mass flux and, consequently, the resulting surface erosion. It has previously been hypothesized by a number of authors (e.g., [1], [6]) that the decrease in mask flux beside the mask edges occurs because, as the edges are approached (i.e., x1 w/2 in Fig. 4.14), the maximum particle size than can pass through the mask without striking it decreases. In other words, at the center of the mask opening (x1=0), particles of all sizes can pass, whereas at the mask edge only the small particles in the powder size distribution can pass. Figs. 4.15 4.20 show the measured particles size distributions inside the mask opening, which confirm that only the smallest particles indeed reach the mask edge.

Comparison of the size distributions of spherical and non-spherical particles inside the mask opening with approximately the same nominal diameters are presented in Figs. 4.21 and 4.22. Fig. 4.21 represents the size distribution of spherical versus angular stainless steels and Fig. 4.22 shows the relative values for 50Âµm glass media. The mask opening width was divided up into 10 Âµm wide bins and the average particle sizes in each bin were then normalized by the value at the center of the channel. The measurements from both sides of the mask opening were averaged. Since the spherical particles such as chronital stainless steels and glass beads are more uniform in size distribution (section 4.2), they have shown a sharper drop towards the mask edge. In contrast, the angular particles of the same material and similar diameter sizes resulted in a smoother drop beside the edges.

4.4. Particle mass distribution within the mask opening

4.4.1. Measured values

The normalized measured distributions of mass flux through the mask opening shown in Figs. 4.23 to 4.28 were determined using the following procedure: The mask opening width was divided up into 10 Âµm wide bins. The approximate mass of particles in a given bin was determined as the sum of the particle masses detected within the bin, based on the known particle material density, and the equivalent particle diameter, as measured by shadowgraphy for each individual particle. The particle mass in each bin across the opening width were then normalized by the mass at the center of the channel. Measurements from both sides of the symmetrical mask opening, i.e. at corresponding x1 and x2's in Fig. 4.14 were averaged to effectively double the sample size.

The distribution of particle mass flux for the masked experiments in Table 3.3 showed a relatively constant value at the center of the mask opening, and decreases of the mass flux near the mask edges.

Error bars represent the sample standard deviations.

71   

The slope of the mass flux distribution at the mask edge thus depends on the particle size distribution. The use of spherical particles (Figs. 4.23 and 4.24) that have a relatively uniform particle size distribution (Figs. 4.12a and 4.12b) near the mean with relatively few small particles will result in a mass flux that abruptly decreases approximately one particle radius from the mask edge. The use of angular particles of similar size (Figs. 4.26 and 4.27), which contain a wider range of particle sizes (Figs. 4.13a and 4.13b), results in a more gradual and smoother decrease in mass flux as the mask edge is approached, since the small particles in the powder can arrive close to the mask edge (Figs. 4.15 to 4.20). The effect of particle size distribution on mass flux distribution through the mask has been previously modeled by Ghobeity et al. [6].

4.4.2. Comparison to model of Ghobeity et al. [6]

The analytical model of Ghobeity et al. [6] predicts that the particle mass flux distribution through the mask opening is a function of the mask width and the particle size distribution. The present work is the first to attempt to assess the validity of this model through direct measurements within the mask opening. Since the particle shape was found to have a strong effect on size uniformity, the predictions of this model were compared to the measured particle sizes for spherical and non-spherical particles.

Ghobeity et al. [6] assumed that the probability of particles passing through the mask opening decreases dramatically as the mask edge is approached, since only progressively smaller particles can pass through the opening without striking the edge as it is approached (Fig. 4.14).

72   

The analytical model they developed based on this assumption expresses the proportion of the total number of particles incident to the mask opening that pass through and arrive to the surface at a given location between x and x + dx, as:

Ps ( x) = 

(W / 2) - x

0

P(r )dr

(4.5)

where P(r) is the probability density function that describes the distribution of particle sizes (assumed spherical with radius, r) and W is the mask opening width [6]. Accordingly, the probability of the particles passing through the centre of the mask opening at x=0 is much higher than near the sides (x W/2). Based on this, Ghobeity et al. derived an expression for M*(r), the normalized distribution mass of particles through the mask opening, i.e. the mass of particles at a given x divided by the mass of particles at x=0, as:

W -x 2

M * ( x) =

0 W 2


0

(4.6)

 r P(r )dr

Figs. 4.12 and 4.13 show the measured particle size distributions incident to the mouth of the mask opening for the particles in Table 3.1, together with the appropriate curve fits. These measured size distributions were in equation (5.2) to predict the mass distribution, and the results are compared to the shadowgraphy measurements in Figs. 4.15 to 4.20. There is a very good agreement of the model-predicted and measured normalized mass flux distributions across the

73   

mask width in all cases, and even near the mask edges where the decreases in flux are expected to have the greatest effect on the surface evolution. The model is able to effectively capture the effect of particle size distribution discussed in Section 4.3.

It is interesting to note that, although the model of Ghobeity et al. [6] uses equivalent spherical diameter particles for angular particles, the predictions of the model are nevertheless in excellent agreement with experiments. This useful result implies that the particle mass distribution through the mask only depends on the size distribution, and not the shape of particles.

4.5. Limitations on applicability of results:

The results of the present study directly show that, if the particle size distribution is measured, under the present blasting conditions, the model of Ghobeity et al. [6] can be used with confidence in surface evolution models in order to predict the size and shape of features machined using AJM. However, there are some factors that should be considered when assessing the generality of the results.

The mask openings that were used in the present experiments were open, allowing particles to freely exit the mask opening. In an actual AJM application, the target substrate would be present at the exit, causing particles to ricochet from the surface back into the mask. However, using a particle tracking model [20], the mass flux used in typical AJM applications

74   

(between 2-4 g/min through a 0.76 mm nozzle), has been previously shown [26] to be sufficiently low that interference between incident and rebounding particles is highly unlikely even in the free jet case. At higher fluxes, where the interference becomes significant, the model of Ghobeity et al. [6] and the conclusions of the present study may not be applicable.

The presence of a surface at the exit of the mask opening might also be expected to affect the velocity and distribution of the particles through the mask opening due to aerodynamic effects. However, this is also not likely to be significant because of the relatively large distance from the nozzle exit (20 mm) where the air velocity is likely very small. For example, for the case of experiment # 5a, the model of Li et al. [5] predicts that the particle velocity is over twice the air velocity 20 mm away from the nozzle. The Stoke number is a dimensionless number which can be also used to study the behavior of particles floating in the air flow. However, for Stoke numbers smaller than 1 the particles follow fluid streamlines closely and for the value greater than 1, particles will detach from a flow especially where the flow velocity decreases rapidly. Previous analysis has shown that the Stokes number for typical AJM particles is on the order of 50-450 [26], i.e., much greater than 1, so that it is unlikely that any deflection in the air jet due to the presence of the surface at the exit would have significantly affected the particle trajectories. In situations where the Stokes number is less than 1 (e.g., using very small particles), these effects may become significant.

CHAPTER 5 Summary, Contributions and Recommendations for Future Work

5.1. Summary and contributions

A shadowgraphic method was used to measure the particle velocity and size distributions using both angular and spherical erosive media in both a free jet and through a mask opening typical of that used in AJM applications. To the knowledge of the author, this is the first time that shadowgraphic methods have been used to measure particle velocities in a free jet typical of that used in AJM. It is also the first time that any technique has been used to measure particle size and velocity through a mask opening. Such measurements are important for determining the inputs to surface evolution models that can be used to predict the size and shape of microchannels and micro-holes machined using AJM. The important findings and contributions can be summarized as follows:

(i)

The free jet experiments demonstrated that the particle shape (sphericity) strongly affects the particle velocities. Using an improved drag coefficient correlation that accounted for the particle sphericity in the analytical model of Ref. [5] resulted in quite accurate predictions of measured velocity distributions across a free jet for both angular and spherical particles.

(ii)

The velocity through narrow mask openings was found to be constant across the opening width but significantly lower than that in the free jet. A reduced etched rate from that
76 

 

found when machining with free jets can thus be expected when micro-machining through masks.

(iii)

No correlation was found between the particle size and position within the free jet.

(iv)

The powder size distributions measured using shadowgraphy in the free jet were used as inputs to the analytical model of Ghobeity et al. [6] to determine the mass flux distribution through the mask opening. The resulting predictions of the model were in excellent agreement with the shadowgraphy measured particle mass flux distribution profiles through the mask opening. It can thus be concluded that the analytical model of Ref. [6] can be used effectively in surface evolution models to predict the mass flux incident to the surface through the mask. Experimental results for both spherical and non-spherical particles also demonstrated that the size distribution and uniformity of particles can greatly affect the mass distribution profile.

(v)

Very few particles were found to ricochet from the edge of the mask, and the ones that did carried very low kinetic energies, and are thus unlikely to significantly contribute to erosion. Under the present conditions, the particle mass flux due to the ricochet of particles from the edge of the mask can thus be considered negligible for the purposes of modeling surface evolution in AJM.

77   

5.2. Recommendations for future work

The presented work only considered jets incident perpendicular to the mask opening at a constant standoff distance of 20 mm. The mask openings that were used in all experiments were open at the exit. However, in an actual AJM application, the target substrate would be present at the exit and this will cause the particles to ricochet from the surface back into the mask. The following points may be regarded as first steps towards continuation of the present work.

(i) Add a target substrate at the exit of the mask opening and investigate the influence of the particle ricochet from the surface back into the mask opening. Subsequently, study the effect of the target surface on the velocity and mass flux distribution of the particles inside the mask opening.

(ii) Investigate the influence of different angles of incidence (other than 90Âº) on the resulting velocity, size and spatial distribution of the particles inside the mask opening. This would be useful to provide inputs for AJM surface evolution models that would be used to predict the shape of micro-features machined with inclined abrasive jets. configurations are useful to sculpt three dimensional suspended micro-features. Such

(iii) Investigate the effect of different mask plate thicknesses and its possible influence on the particle size and, consequently, mass distribution inside the mask opening.

(iv) Study the coefficients of restitution for ricocheting particles and their influences on the mass distribution profile of abrasive powders within the mask opening area and particularly near the sidewalls. (v) Examine the interference between incident and rebounding particles by applying the higher particle mass fluxes through the air jet and study the effect of this factor in particle velocity and size distributions inside the mask opening.
