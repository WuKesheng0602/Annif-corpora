Abstract
CHACTERIZATION OF THE ROLE OF YADK IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ENTEROHAEMORRHAGIC E. COLI O157:H7
Yijing Yu, MSc. in Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2011

Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 can cause serious diarrhea and haemolytic uremic syndrome. Various virulence factors including adhesins contribute to pathogenesis of EHEC. Previous studies suggested that yadK gene, which encodes a putative fimbrial adhesin in EHEC, may be involved in response of EHEC to acid stress. To characterize role of YadK protein in the pathogenesis of EHEC, recombinant YadK protein was generated and used to immunize rabbit to obtain anti-YadK antiserum, which was able to specifically recognize over-expressed YadK protein in EHEC. Western blotting with anti-YadK revealed a higher level of YadK expression in EHEC under acid adapted-acid stress compared to EHEC under unstressed conditions, which confirmed earlier yadK mRNA studies and indicated that YadK is upregulated in EHEC under acid stress. Finally, we observed that anti-YadK antiserum was able to specifically reduce adhesion of acid stressed EHEC to human epithelial cells compared to adhesion level of unstressed EHEC.

1. Introduction
Escherichia coli (E. coli) is commonly found in the environment. Most E. coli strains are harmless to humans; however, some strains, such as enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC O157:H7), present a major threat to human health primarily through food or water contamination. Unlike most commensal strains of E. coli, EHEC disrupts the physiological balance of resident flora in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. EHEC infection can cause serious bloody or non-bloody diarrhea and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in human patients1. The 1982 outbreaks of EHEC O157:H7 infection in the United States of America posed a serious problem to the public health. A recent EHEC O104:H4 outbreak in Europe has been reported to infect more than 2400 people2.

Enteric pathogens, including EHEC, must be able to survive the harsh environment of GI tract in order to cause infection. EHEC, on route to the site of colonization in the large intestine, encounter harsh conditions, including acid stress in the stomach, bile salt stress in small intestine, and short fatty acid stress in large intestine3. While there has been considerable progress in understanding the pathogenesis of EHEC, we still know relatively little about changes in EHEC virulence in response to stress.

Adhesion to host cells, a critical virulence property, is an integral event for bacterial colonization to the host cell surfaces, and is often an essential step during bacterial infection. Adhesins are the bacterial surface components that are responsible for the 1

attachment of bacteria to specific host receptors. The types of host cells targeted by bacteria are determined by the bacterial adhesins4. Shiga-toxin (Stx) or Verocytoxin (Vtx), is the most important virulence factor in EHEC. In addition, a number of non-toxin virulence factors have been reported5-7. Fimbrial adhesins, which are one group of non-toxin virulence factors, participate in the adherence of EHEC O157:H7 to eukaryotic cells and play an essential role in biofilm formation8. However, the regulatory mechanisms of fimbrial expression are not well understood.

1.1 Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7

EHEC O157:H7 are Gram-negative rod shaped bacteria. EHEC O157:H7 are distinguished from other pathogenic strains of E. coli by the lack of -glucuronidase production1. But like other kinds of pathogenic E. coli bacteria, several virulence factors encoded in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) and the phage encoded Shiga-toxin (Stx) genes were also found in EHEC O157:H79-10. These virulence factors are essential for the survival and infection of these EHEC.

Individuals infected with EHEC O157:H7 typically develop water diarrhea which progresses to bloody diarrhea or hemorrhagic colitis (HC) within a week. Most of them recover gradually. However, about 5-10% of HC cases will progress to systemic complications known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)11. HUS is characterized

2

by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure12. Children and the elderly have the highest incidence of developing this life-threatening syndrome12.

The major transmission of EHEC from animals to humans occurs via food chain contamination. The consumption of contaminated bovine-derived products, such as ground beef and raw milk, has been linked to O157:H7 outbreaks. Manure contaminated runoff is another source of EHEC contamination in crop irrigation systems, as the EHEC-colonized cattle can continuously shed off EHEC bacteria, thus contaminating drinking water13-14; other waterborne outbreaks can be traced to contaminated fruits and vegetables. Person to person transmission is also possible, as the infectious dose could be achieved at a very low dose (i.e. 102 organisms)15.

So far, effective therapies to prevent and treat EHEC infection are limited. Many antibiotics including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole could produce rapid bactericidal activity, but still allowing continuous toxin synthesis before cell death. In contrast, azithromycin was able to reduce the Stx production even when O157:H7 remained at high viability16. A recent report has revealed that an antibody therapy (the monoclonal C5 antibody eculizumab) successfully inhibited and reversed kidney damage and neurological symptoms in 3 years old EHEC infected children17. To develop better therapeutic treatments, an understanding of EHEC O157:H7 virulence responses and pathogenesis is required.

1.2 Bacterial responses to acid stress Bacterial growth and survival can be affected by many environmental factors, and bacteria have to adapt and survive under various environmental challenges. Most of E. coli strains have an optimal growth condition range (i.e. pH, oxygen, nutrition compounds and temperature), which is suitable for growth in natural or laboratory conditions18.

Many studies have shown that adhesion of EHEC O157:H7 to host cells is influenced by exposure to selected stresses3. It has been demonstrated that acid shock (pH 3.0) preceded by adaptation to mild acid stress (pH 5.0) for 1h significantly increased EHEC adhesion to human epithelial cells3. Another study reported that adhesion of EHEC to Caco-2 cells was significantly increased after long-term adaptation to salt stress, compared to the standard condition (i.e. no salt)19. In yet another study, the lack of lactose resulted in the inhibition of LEE genes expression, leading to decreased EHEC adhesion to HEp-2 cells20.

Studies have shown that low pH can cause damage to bacteria through affecting the cytoplasmic membrane, denaturing essential proteins, disrupting the intracellular enzyme function and damaging the chromosome DNA21. E. coli has evolved acid resistance (AR) mechanisms to survive in an acidic environment. The definition of AR in E. coli is the ability to withstand the acid challenge at pH 2.5 or even lower pH. Three types of acid response system have been investigated in acid resistance of E. 4

coli22. The oxidative repressed acid resistance (AR1) is a glucose-repressed system, which is associated with the alternative sigma factor s (encoded by rpoS gene) and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP)23. Mutations in the rpoS gene have been found in natural and laboratory strains, but these mutant strains still survive under acid stress, indicating that other rpoS-independent AR systems are involved in recovering the acid tolerance response24.

The other two acid response systems belong to amino acid decarboxylase-dependent systems: one requires glutamate (AR2) while the other needs arginine (AR3). E. coli usually could not survive in highly acidic (i.e. below pH 2.5) LB in the absence of glucose, unless glutamate or arginine was present 22. Generally speaking, AR1 system is thought to be sufficient for E. coli survival in the mildly acidic environment, while AR2 and AR3 are responsible for E. coli survival under relatively low pH acid stress (i.e. pH 2-3)25. The AR2 system has been more extensively studied compared to other two AR systems23. AR2 system are composed of proteins encoded by three genes (i.e. gadA, gadB and gadC), respectively. gadA and gadB encode highly homologous glutamate decarboxylase isozymes (GadA and GadB), while gadC encodes the -aminobutyric acid (GABA) antiporter (Figure 1.1)24. For AR3, arginine decarboxylase AdiA (encoded by adiA) converts arginine to agmatine, while the antiporter AdiC transports arginine and agmatine across the membrane in opposite directions26.

5

The mechanism of AR is to induce bacterial pH homeostasis, by keeping intracellular pH less acidic. As shown in Figure 1.1, the low pH extracellular environment allows the proton to move into the bacterial cells and the proton is then consumed by GadA and GadB through decarboxlation of glutamate into GABA. As a membrane bound transporter, GadC transports glutamate into cell while transporting GABA out of cell. In this way, an intracellular pH homeostasis can be maintained.

Figure 1.1 Model of glutamate-dependent acid resistance in E. coli24. C indicates GadC, an antiporter; GABA represents -amino butyric acid. GadA and GadB are glutamate decarboxylase isoforms, which mediates decarboxylation of glutamate into GABA. When the extracellular pH reaches low, the proton can travel into bacterial cells. To maintain intracellular pH homeostasis, GadA and GadB consume a proton into CO2 by decarboxylation of glutamate into GABA. The antiporter GadC transports glutamate in and GABA out of bacteria, to consume more protons.

1.3 Response of EHEC O157:H7 to acid stress Low pH (i.e. pH 1.5-3) in the stomach is one of the first host defenses that foodborne pathogens encounter in the human GI tract. Exposure to stomach acid stress is a survival challenge for many foodborne pathogens before reaching to final

6

colonization sites, but EHEC O157:H7 is able to survive passage through the acidic environment of GI tract3. In vitro studies found that EHEC O157:H7 can also survive for periods of time in other acidic environments, such as apple cider (pH 3.6-4), mayonnaise (pH 3.6-3.9 and fermented sausage (pH 4.5)27.

EHEC O157:H7 has also been reported to show enhanced survival in acute acid if pre-adapted by exposure to mild acid27. EHEC O157:H7 shows enhanced growth in apple cider (pH 3.6), if it is pre-adapted in broth (pH 5)28. Another study showed that pre-exposure of a clinical isolate of EHEC O157:H7 to pH 4.5 resulted in greater tolerance to acute acidic conditions as low as pH 3.029. Acid adaptation also influences the tolerance of EHEC to other environmental stresses. For example, the acid-adapted EHEC O157:H7 has increased tolerance to thermal stress and higher sodium chloride concentrations30. It also has been demonstrated that acid-adaption of EHEC O157:H7 induces cross-protection against activated lactoperoxidase and lactic lactoperoxidase, which are used to control EHEC O157:H7 contamination in the milk industry31.

The adhesion of pathogenic E. coli to epithelial cells was also enhanced under acid stress3,32. Exposure either to acute acid stress or acid-adapted acid stress significantly enhances adhesion of EHEC to human epithelial cells3. Similar to EHEC, enhanced bacterial adhesion to human epithelial cells after acid stress was also observed for diarrhaegenic pathogen EPEC32. 7

Through transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of EHEC O157:H7 under various culture conditions, the potential genes involved in the response of EHEC to acid stress were explored3, 33-35. It has been shown that exposure of EHEC to the mild acid stress of apple juice (pH 3.5) was associated with significant up-regulation of several genes encoding shock proteins and putative membrane proteins33. Recently, mRNA extractions from E. coli K12 and EHEC O157:H7 exposed to acetic, lactic and hydrochloric acid (pH 5.5) are compared34. The universal acid response genes that are up-regulated in acid shocked EHEC O157:H7, but not in E. coli K12, were involved in heat shock response, osmoregulation, inorganic ion and nucleotide transport and metabolism, translation and energy production34. A DNA microarray study revealed that exposure of EHEC to a variety of acid adaptation and acid shock conditions resulted in a significant increase in the expression of a variety of virulence factors, including molecules involved in adhesion, motility and type III secretion3. Mass spectrometry studies of EHEC O157:H7 have demonstrated that numerous proteins involved in metabolism were increased in an acidic environment, including GadA and GadB (acid resistance) and ompA (outer membrane protein)35.

1.4 Virulence factors

Shiga toxin (Stx) (also known as Verocytoxin), is a critical virulence factor in EHEC1. In addition, a number of non-toxin virulence factors have been reported (Figure 1.2)1.

8

Figure 1.2 The Virulence factors in EHEC O157:H7. LEE represents the locus of enterocyte effacement; A/E indicates attaching and effacing. 1.4.1 Shiga Toxin There are two major members in Shiga Toxin (Stx) family: Stx1 and Stx2. The homologous percentage between Stx1 and Stx2 is 56%36. Three Stx2 variants (Stx2c, Stx2d and Stx2e) have been identified. Stx1 and all of these Stx2 proteins except Stx2e bind to glycolipid globotriaosylceramide-3 receptor (Gb3), while Stx2e binds to glycolipid globotriaosylceramide-4 receptor (Gb4)37. Stx2 is more highly associated with HUS and more toxic than Stx138.

Each Stx consists of one A subunit and five identical B subunits, which belongs to the AB4 toxin family. The five B subunits (7.7 KDa) bind to the Gb3 on the host cell surface, resulting in the translocation of Stx complex into the host cells by endocytosis. After being translocated into the host cells, the A subunit is excised to generate the catalytically active A1 (27kDa) and A2 (4KDa) units (Figure 1.3). The A1 subunit inhibits protein synthesis in host cell by removing an adenine residue from 9

the 60S rRNA, leading to death of the host cell36. The host cell death subsequently causes the breakdown of the epithelial cell barrier which results in the bloody diarrhea in EHEC-mediated gastroenteritis39. Stx is also toxic to human renal endothelial cells. The decreased glomerular filtration rate leads to the acute renal failure, which is also known as haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). In this disease process, Stx can not only directly damage the glomerular endothelial cells but can also influence the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-640.

Figure 1.3 The proposed working model for Shiga-toxin36. The B subunit interacts with cellular receptor Gb3 or Gb4, A subunit is cleaved in cytoplasm, resulting in a 27kDa N-terminal fragment (A1) and a 4kDa C-terminal peptide (A2). A1 binds to ribosome and stop translation, leading to host cell death.

1.4.2 The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) The attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion is one of the characteristic features that distinguish EHEC from many other pathogenic E. coli strains. Typically, the A/E lesion is characterized by host cytoskeletal changes, including high concentrations of polymerized filamentous actin and other cytoskeletal components (such as -actinin, 10

talin and ezrin) in the infection sites41. Most A/E phenotype genes are encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)42-44.

The 43kb-length of the LEE pathogenecity island is composed of five operons (LEE1-5), including 41 different open reading frames. The genes encoding the translocated proteins of the type III secretion system (TTSS), such as EspA, EspB and EspD, are located in LEE1, LEE2 and LEE343. Translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which facilitates intimate binding to host epithelium in concert with other LEE-encoded proteins43, is encoded in LEE5.

1.4.3 Virulence plasmid In additional to virulence factors encoded in bacterial chromosomes, all of E. coli O157:H7 strains contain a plasmid called pO157, with a size ranging from 92kb to 104kb1. Only 19 of 100 open reading frames (ORF) in this plasmid have been characterized in E. coli O157:H71. The 19 gene products include a serine protease called EspP, found to cleave human coagulation factor V and cause mucosal hemorrhage characteristic of hemorrhagic colitis45, and a putative adhesin ToxB (toxB) shown to contribute to the adherence of E. coli O157:H7 to epithelial cells46.

1.5 Bacterial adhesins Adhesins are the bacterial surface components that are responsible for the adhesion of bacteria to host cells. EHEC O157:H7 adhesins can be divided into fimbrial adhesins 11

and non-fimbrial adhesins (including one intimin gene)47. 1.5.1 Fimbriae family members Many bacterial species possess long filamentous structures known as pili or fimbriae extending from their surfaces. Fimbriae have been implicated in various events, such as host­pathogen interactions, colonization and invasion48. Non-flagellar organelles of Gram-negative bacteria include the well characterized chaperone/usher-assembled fimbriae, type IV fimbriae and curli8. In each of these systems, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to efficiently assemble the highly stable fimbrial structures on their surfaces49.

Fimbriae are wiry or rod-shaped, fiber-like structures located on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae can recognize particular receptors on the surface of different host cells (e.g. epithelial cells)8. The subunits encoded by fimbrial operons usually have similar genetic organization. Briefly, each operon has one or two genes that encode regulatory factors, and a major subunit, several minor subunits, a chaperone and an outer membrane usher. The fimbrial chaperone is the periplasmic protein that can specifically bind fimbrial subunits to form chaperone-fimbrial subunit complexes, which facilitates the assembly of pilus50. The usher is an outer membrane protein that directs the assembling order of pilus subunits into a pilus50. The genetic organization of fimbriae operon in the pathogenic EHEC is shown in Figure 1.451-52.

Red filled arrows indicate major subunit within operon; blue filled arrows refer to minor subunit within operon; white filled arrows indicate chaperone of usher within operon.

According to genetic analysis, 16 potential fimbrial gene clusters have been reported in EHEC O157:H7. Thirteen of them have putative chaperone and usher genes, indicating these 13 gene clusters may be involved in the chaperone and usher pathway53, while the other 3 clusters (locus 7, MAT and ppdD) may be associated to curli and type IV fimbriae. To date, 7 gene clusters have been demonstrated to be expressed in EHEC strains, including locus 13 (Lpf), locus 8 (F9), locus 7 (curli), MAT (ECP) and ppdD (HCP)54-58. However, it is still unknown whether the rest of gene clusters are functional in EHEC53, 56. A well characterized type I fimbrial gene cluster (locus 14), the genetic organization of which is similar to F9 fimbrial gene 13

cluster (locus 8), is also located on EHEC O157:H7 chromosome53. Fimbriae encoded on a plasmid in EHEC O157:H7 will also be described here.

1.5.1.1 Type I fimbriae Type I fimbriae, one of the most studied fimbrial types, have been found in many E. coli strains. Typically, type I fimbriated bacteria have 200-500 copies of fimbriae on their surfaces59. Under electron microscope, each fimbriae is a 7nm wide, 1m long and rod-shaped fiber60 (Figure 1.5). Since the fim genes encoding type I fimbriae, have been found in commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains, type I fimbriae are considered as important colonization factors and potential virulence factors56.

The genes involved in production of type I fimbriae are located in the bacterial chromosomes, where these genes form the gene cluster61 (Figure 1.4). There are six genes (i.e. fimA, fimC, fimD, fimF, fimG and fimH) associated with fimbriae expression and two genes (i.e. fimB and fimE) involved in the regulation of fimbriae expression61. Due to a 16bp deletion in the invertible element, type I fimbriae may not express in EHEC O157:H762.

1.5.1.2 F9 fimbriae F9 fimbria is one of the 16 fimbrial clusters found on EHEC O157:H7 chromosome53. Introduction of the F9 operon into the E. coli K12 strains increases bacterial adhesion to host cells, while a deletion of the major subunit of the F9 operon in E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 strain results in decreased colonization of these E. coli in calves58.

1.5.1.3 Long polar fimbriae (Lpf) Two lpf loci (locus 12 and locus 13) in EHEC, with high homology to the long polar fimbriae (Lpf) in Salmonella enterica, have been identified64. The lpf form surface structures that are 7­8nm in diameter and 2­10m in length extending from bacterial cell surface. The six characterized open-reading frames in the lpf operon of EHEC 15

showed considerable similarity to the lpf gene cluster in S. enterica57. Cloning of the EHEC lpf operon into non-fimbriated E. coli K-12 results in the increased adhesion of these E. coli to cultured epithelial cells, indicating a role of long polar fimbriae in bacterial adhesion to host cells57.

The protein prediction analysis reveals a high structural homology between Lpf proteins and Fim proteins of type I fimbriae57. The major subunit encoded in the lpf operon, LpfA, has the similar structure as FimA, while LpfB and LpfC proteins share a high homology to FimC and FimD, the usher-chaperone subunits of type I fimbriae57.

1.5.1.4 Other types of fimbriae Recently, a type IV PpdD pilus has been found in E. coli O157:H7 and this pilus was recognized by serum from HUS patients suggesting that it was expressed on the pathogen during the infection56. The homology between PpdD of E. coli K12 and Shigella is high (91%)56. Under the electron microscope, PadD pili appear with a long (>20 m), thin and rod-like shape56. Three genes are involved in the synthesis of these pili, including hcpA (pilin gene), hofB (usher gene) and hofC (chaperone gene). In vitro studies of an hcpA mutant indicated that PpdD pili played an important role in the EHEC adhesion to epithelial cells (e.g. Caco-2, HEp-2 and Hela cells)56.

16

Sfp fimbriae encoded by sfp cluster are located in a plasmid of sorbitol-fermenting (SF) EHEC O157. Electron microscopy reveals that Sfp fimbriae are around 0.4m long and 3-5nm wide45. Six genes in this cluster, sfpA, sfpH, sfpC, sfpD, sfpJ and sfpG, are highly homologous to P fimbriae. It has been demonstrated that anaerobic culture condition can induce Sfp fimbriae expression which is associated with increased adherence to host epithelial cells65.

Curli is found to be expressed in a few EHEC O157 strains. The studies with csgD mutants indicate a temperature-independent phase-variation manner in the expression of EHEC O157 curli66. It has been suggested that curli may contribute to EHEC adhesion ability, as EHEC with curli expression exhibit a more massive adhesion to HEp-2 cells, compared to EHEC with no-curli expression54.

The MAT fimbrial gene cluster has also been found in the chromosomes of many E. coli strains (e.g. EHEC O157:H7), and the encoded pilus called E. coli Common Pilus (Ecp) is found to be expressed in several EHEC O157:H7 strains53. EcpA, previously known as YadZ, is the major subunit of MAT fimbriae. The ecpA mutant EHEC exhibits a decreased adhesion to HEp-2 cells, indicating that Ecp may play a role in EHEC adhesion55.

The Locus 2 operon is predicted to be a chaperone-usher fimbrial operon in EHEC O157:H7. With the use of a promoter fusion construct, It is reported that the 17

expression of locus 2 is not observed under standard culture conditions59. However, a DNA microarray study revealed that the transcription level of 6 genes in the locus 2 operon increased in EHEC O157:H7 under acid-adapted acid stress, suggesting that this putative adhesion may be important for adhesion of acid-stressed EHEC3

1.5.2 Regulation of fimbriae expression The expression of fimbriae is directed by the selection pressure under different growing conditions53. In general, the fimbrial expression is regulated by local environmental conditions, global regulatory factors and genetic regulatory mechanisms64, 67-69.

1.5.2.1 Local regulators (temperature and pH) A temperature-dependent model has been reported for the expression of many fimbrial adhesins64, 70-71. It has been reported that the production of SEF14 fimbriae in S. serotype Typhimurium are enhanced at 37 °C but not 20 °C, while SEF17 fimbriae are increased at 20 °C but not 37 °C72. Studies with long polar fimbriae (LPF) in E. coli O157:H7 have shown that the transcription level of the lpfAlp::lacZ is not significantly induced at 30 °C, but its expression significantly increases at stationary phase at 37 °C64.

Studies with K99 and F41 fimbriae have shown that the pH of the culture medium greatly influences the fimbrial production73. The optimal pH value for K99 and F41 18

fimbriae expression is 7, and thus the production of fimbriae decreases when pH is either higher or lower than 774. In contrast, the mRNA expression profile of acid-stressed EHEC reveals a significant increase in several known putative adhesins including yadK, a putative fimbrial adhesin gene that showed 5.87-fold increase, after EHEC was exposed to acid stress treatment3.

1.5.2.2 Global regulatory factors Several global regulatory factors, such as histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS), Leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and integration host factor (IHF), have been intensively studied71, 75-76.

The histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS) protein, a 136 amino acid residues protein comprised of a C-terminal DNA binding domain and an N-terminal protein interacting domain, was found to have a negative regulatory effect on certain virulence factors encoded on the LEE pathogenicity island, subsequently affecting fimbrial expression and EHEC acid tolerance77. Many studies have shown that H-NS is involved in regulating the E. coli adherence, through repressing genes encoding fimbrial adhesins. such as P fimbriae71. A microarray study revealed that fimB and fimI, encoding type I fimbrial subunits, were significantly up-regulated in E. coli K12 hns mutant67. Other putative fimbrial adhesin genes, yadN, yaiP, yagX and ycbQ were also up-regulated in the hns mutant67. This indicates H-NS may play a repressive role in fimbrial expression in E. coli. 19

Lrp is composed of two 18.8 kDa subunits78, and it is a global regulator in E. coli, where Lrp controls the expression of many genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, transport and degradation79. Lrp also regulated expression of many fimbriae including fim, sfa, daa, pap, and fan operons80. Similar to Lrp, IHF can also regulate the expression of many fimbriae81.

1.5.2.3 Genetic regulatory mechanisms The genetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the regulation of fimbriae expression can be divided into an "ON"/"OFF" phase switch and post-transcriptional regulation.

Almost all fimbrial operons were found to encode one or two regulatory proteins and these proteins, under most circumstances, are involved in phase variation mechanism, in which the fimbriae expression state is switched between phase-on (expression) and phase-off (non-expression) states68. The variation is controlled by two regulatory proteins, FimB and FimE. FimB has the ability to turn the switch in either direction, while FimE can only turn the switch from "on" to "off" orientation82. The expression of type I fimbriae was examined in 46 strains of diarrheagenic E. coli, and according to the mannose-sensitive hemagglutination (MSHA) test (i.e. the binding ability of E. coli to pig erythrocytes with or without D-mannose), only 4 strains exhibited the MSHA-positive phenotype62. However, none of the O157:H7 and O157: H- strains express Type I fimbriae, because a 16-bp deletion was found in all these O157:H7 and O157: H- strains that locked the fim switch in the "off" orientation62. 20

The post-transcription regulation mechanism determines the expression level of different proteins in one operon. All fimbrial operons typically contain a gene that encodes the major subunit of the fimbriae and this gene translates much larger amount of subunits compared to other subunits61, 83. It has been demonstrated that the fimbriae mRNAs encoding the major subunit are relatively stable while the mRNA encoding other subunits degrades rapidly. Thus, different degradation rates of mRNAs also control the fimbriae gene expression69.

1.5.3 Fimbrial assembly and donor strand exchange mechanisms All structural fimbrial subunits are synthesized in the bacterial cytoplasm as proteins with an N-terminal signal sequence84. They are then translocated into periplasm, which is dependent on a general secretory pathway. In the periplasm, almost all subunit proteins can recognize and bind to the chaperones encoded by the same gene cluster85. After fimbrial domain proteins interacting with the chaperone, the complex can interact with the bacterial outer membrane usher encoded by the same gene cluster, and then the subunits translocate across the outer membrane and become exposed at the cell surface, contributing to the fimbrial assembly. Two components of the structural subunits contribute to this chaperone-usher pathway. The chaperone binds each fimbrial subunit, capping its interactive surfaces and maintaining them in an assembly-component conformation. Then, the chaperon-subunit complexes are transferred to the outer membrane protein, usher, where the chaperone is released. The usher then assists the subunits bind to the primer subunit and, the fimbrial

21

polymerization occurs. Thus, this donor strand exchange mechanism plays an essential role in the fimbriae assembly process86 (Figure 1.6).

Figure 1.6 Donor strand exchange mechanism in type I fimbriae85. The type I fimbrial domains are similar to the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain but lack the last -strand. The missing -strand of all fimbrial domains leaves a hydrophobic groove exposed to the solvent, which leads to all fimbrial subunits unstable unless they interact with the chaperone in periplasm or a complementary -strand is donated by the N-terminal extension of the following subunit in outer membrane. After fimbrial subunits interacting with the chaperone, the chaperone-subunit complexes interact with user and then the subunits translocate across the outer membrane, contributing to the fimbrial assembly.

1.5.4 Non-fimbrial adhesins in EHEC As described above, the bacterial adhesins play an essential role in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells. In addition to fimbriae adhesins, of EHEC O157:H7 also encode a number of the non-fimbrial adhesions47, such as EHEC factor for adherence (Efa), IrgA homologous adhesin (Iha) and Intimin.

22

The role of efa was first identified in the transposon mutant of a Shiga-toxin producing EHEC clinical isolate of serotype O111:H-, which lost the adhesion to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells87. When a truncated efa-1 gene was cloned in EHEC EDL933 or Sakai strains, the adhesion of these bacterial strains to human epithelial cells was impaired88. Transformation of non-pathogenic E. coli with iha confers an increased adhesion of these E. coli on human epithelial cells, suggesting the role of Iha in the bacterial adhesion89. In EHEC, intimin is responsible for the intimate attachment of bacteria to host cells and the eae gene which encodes intimin, is located in the LEE of bacterial chromosomes7.

1.6 YadK: a putative fimbrial protein

Previous microarray studies in our lab found that the expression of yadK gene from locus 2 fimbrial operon in EHEC, exhibited 5.87-fold increase after exposure to acid stress3. Amino acid analysis predicted YadK to be a putative fimbrial adhesin of EHEC. Increased expression of yadK mRNA in acid-adapted acid stress was subsequently confirmed by quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), suggesting that this yadK gene is involved in the EHEC response to acid stress90 (Fig 1.7 A). Studies with a yadK mutant in EHEC, showed that this mutant strain lost the acid-induced adhesion phenotype observed for the parent wild-type (WT) strain90. This adhesion phenotype was restored by complementing yadK expression in 85-170yadK with a yadK-expressing vector (Fig 1.7 B). This suggests that yadK gene plays an essential role in the adhesion of acid-stressed to host cells. 23

B: Adhesion of EHEC wild type and yadK under stress condition90. The adhesion of the yadK mutant cells was significantly reduced compared to 85170 wild-type cells under AA; Over-expression of yadK in yadK mutant cells (yadK/pSKyadK) caused the significant increase in the adhesion of these mutant cells under acid-adapted acid stress. The data represents the mean of three independent experiments ± standard deviation bars (n=3 per group)90.

24

The yadK gene is located in the locus 2 fimbrial operon of EHEC and has 591bp length (Figure 1.8). The yadK gene has been identified in EHEC O157 strains, with a low degree of homology reported to yadK in non-virulent E. coli K12 strains, suggesting that YadK is a potential virulence factor in EHEC. Protein sequence analysis reveals YadK is to be a 196 amino acid protein with 21.2kDa molecular weight.

Locus 2, in which yadK is located, is composed of 7 transcript genes (i.e. yadC, yadK, yadL, yadM, htrE, ecpD and yadN)91. Interestingly, 6 of 7 Locus 2 genes were up-regulated under acid stress3 (Figure 1.8). The genetic organization of Locus 2 follows the similar genetic organization as other chaperone-usher fimbrial operon. The genes in Locus 2 that are involved in regulation and biosynthesis of fimbriae are contiguous. Locus 2 has one or two genes which encode regulatory factors and the other genes encode a major subunit, several minor subunits, a chaperone and an outer membrane usher51-52. Figure 1.9A shows the genetic organization of Type I fimbriae and Locus 2, respectively, and the yadK in Locus 2 is predicted to encode a minor subunit. As the fimbrial genetic order of Locus 2 is similar to that of the chaperone-usher pathway in Type I fimbriae, the subunits encoded by Locus 2 are very likely translocated from periplasmic to outer membrane through the usher HtrE with the aid of chaperone EcpD. The major subunit YadN is close to HtrE, while the YadK minor subunit may be at the tip of these putative fimbriae (Figure 1.9 B).

The tip of adhesin is recognized by chaperone first, and forms the chaperone-subunit complex. The usher recognizes this complex and facilitate the assembly of fimbiae86.

27

Several studies suggested the potential genetic regulators of yadK or yad operon, such as H-NS and AI-267, 92-93. As mentioned above, H-NS was reported to negatively regulate the fimbrial expression71,
94

. One microarray study revealed that gene

expression of yadN, which encodes the major subunit in locus 2 fimbriae, was up-regulated 23-fold in hns mutant compared to wild type strains67. Furthermore, the yad operon promoter activity in K-12 was found significantly up in hns mutant compared to wild type, which indicates H-NS could repress yad operon transcript92.

Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is the only species-nonspecific autoinducer known in bacteria and is produced by both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms95. It has been reported that AI-2 signaling is induced by acidic shock in probiotic strains of Lactobacillus96. DNA microarray studies suggested that yadK was strongly regulated by AI-2 expression, identifying yadK as one of the genes that respond to AI-2 signaling activity93. The expression of yadK and yadN was increased by 3.8 and 3.5-fold in the EHEC WT strain, respectively, when a higher AI-2 concentration was present in the culture media93. Studies with ground beef extracts also found that the presence of AI-2 could enhance the expression of yadK in EHEC97.

1.7 Rationale:

The adhesion process is an essential step for the virulence of pathogenic E. coli. Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of yadK is significantly 28

up-regulated in acid stressed EHEC relative to unstressed EHEC, and that disruption of the yadK gene result in loss of the acid-induced adhesion phenotype observed in wild type EHEC. These data strongly suggest that the YadK protein, purported to be a fimbrial protein, functions as a subunit of an acid-induced EHEC fimbrial structure. However, there is no evidence to date that acid stress up-regulates YadK protein, and that the YadK protein participates in acid-induced adhesion of EHEC to host cells.

1.8 Hypothesis: Acid stress up-regulates expression of the putative fimbrial protein YadK, and YadK protein plays a role in the acid-induced adhesion of EHEC to host cells.

1.9 Thesis Objectives: I: Generation and purification of recombinant YadK protein and subsequent anti-YadK antibodies production.

In order to investigate the role of YadK protein in EHEC pathogenesis, the recombinant vectors carrying yadK gene were constructed and then transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. YadK protein expression was induced and purified through the affinity chromatography technique. Then the purified YadK proteins were used to immunize a rabbit to generate anti-YadK polyclonal antibodies. The specificity of polyclonal antibodies against YadK was assayed by Western blotting.

29

II: Determination of the YadK protein expression under various culture conditions EHEC and yadK deletion mutants were cultured under acid-adapted acid or no-acid stress conditions, respectively. The expression level of YadK protein in EHEC under different acid stress treatment was quantified by Western blotting, using Image J program to compare band intensities relative to a standardized loading control.

III: Effects of anti-YadK antiserum on the EHEC adhesion to host cells. Acid-adapted acid treated EHEC or unstressed EHEC were pre-incubated with anti-YadK antiserum before incubation with human epithelial cells. The adhesion of EHEC under various stresses to host cells was then examined.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Bacteria strains and growth conditions All bacterial strains used in this study were listed in Table 2.1. Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates (1% tryptone (EMD, Mississauga, ON, Canada); 0.5% yeast extract (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada); 0.5% sodium chloride (EMD INC, Mississauga, ON, Canada); 1.5% agar (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada)) with or without antibiotics (100 g/mL of kanamycin (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) or 100 g/mL ampicillin (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada)) were used to subculture bacteria cells from glycerol stocks. A single isolated colony for each strain was cultured in 10 mL of LB broth (with or without antibiotics) at 37 C for 16-18 h with agitation. All strains carrying the red vector pKD46 (Salmonella (pKD46) and EDL933 (pKD46), Clontech, Mountain View, CA)) were grown at 30 oC, as the plasmid was sensitive to high temperature (above 35 oC).

2.2 Cell culture The human epithelial cell line, HEp-2 (ATCC), which was used in the earlier adhesion studies, was cultured in Minimal Essential Media 1x Eagle's (MEM) (Wisent, ST-BRUNO, Quebec, Canada; with Earle's salts and L-glutamine) incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, in the presence of gentamycin (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) (20 g/mL) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Wisent, ST-BRUNO, Quebec, Canada). The passage of the cultured HEp-2 cells was performed every 7 days. 31

2.3 Plasmid purification Plasmid (pET23d or pGEX-4T3; Table 2.2) was extracted from stock strains for colony construction, using a plasmid preparation kit and following the manufacturers' instructions (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) (Figure 2.1). An overnight culture of each strain was grown at 37 oC with agitation. A 2 mL overnight culture was pelleted in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube by centrifugation at 12000 g for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded and 250 L of the Re-suspension Solution (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) was used to re-suspend the pellet. 250 L of Lysis Solution (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) and 350 L Neutralization Solution (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) were added to the suspension and mixed gently. The suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at 12000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to the supplied GeneJETTM spin column and discarded after centrifugation. The column was washed twice with 500 L Wash Solution (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada). Finally, 50 L Elution Buffer (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) was used to elute plasmid DNAs that were then stored at -20 oC for future use. Table 2.2 List of plasmids used in this study. Vectors

2.5 Preparation of chemically competent cells A single isolated colony of DH5 or BL21(DE3) (gift from Dr. Roberto Botelho's lab, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada) strain was grown in 10 mL LB overnight at 37 oC with agitation. The next day, the overnight culture was diluted at 1:100 into fresh LB and re-cultured at 37oC with agitation until the optical density (OD600) reached 0.4. The cells were briefly chilled on ice for 10 min and harvested at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4 oC. The cell pellets were re-suspended with 10 mL cold CaCl2 solution (60 mM CaCl2 (EMD, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 15% glycerol (EMD, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and 10 mM PIPES (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada); filter sterilized and stored at 4 °C), and were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 oC. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets were re-suspended in 10 mL ice-cold CaCl2 solution, and chilled on ice for 30 min. The cells were re-suspended in 2 mL ice-cold CaCl2 solution and stored at -80 °C for future use.

2.6 Restriction enzyme digestion Plasmid pET23d and PCR product (yadK amplified from EDL933 genomic DNA with T7yadKfull-F-BamHI and H6yadK-R-HindIII primers) were digestion with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada). Briefly, 5 L of a DNA sample (pET23d plasmid or PCR product as above) was mixed with 2 L of 10X BamHI buffer (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) and 11.5 L of nuclease-free water. 0.5 L of BamHI and 1 L of HindIII were added the 36

reaction, followed by incubation in 37 °C water bath for 1 h. For pGEX construct preparation, 5 L of DNA sample (pGEX plasmid or yadK amplified from EDL933 genomic DNA with pGEX-yadK-F-BamHI and pGEX-yadK-R-XhoI primers) was mixed with 2 L of 10X BamHI buffer (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) and 11.5 L of nuclease-free water(Gibco, Burlington, ON, Canada). Then 0.5 L of BamHI and 1 L of XhoI were added.

2.7 Gel extraction After double digestion, the digested DNA sample was loaded on the 1 % agarose gel (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The specific section of the gel containing the DNA band of interest was collected under UV light. The gel slice was weighted and transferred into a microcentrifuge tube for DNA extraction using gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON, Canada). The eluted pure DNA products were confirmed on 1 % agarose gel and then stored at -20 °C.

2.8 Ligation The purified vector DNA (clean double-digested plasmid) was mixed with DNA of interest (clean double-digested PCR product) at the 1:3 ratio, following the manufacturers' suggestions. The 4 L 5X buffer and 1 L ligase (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) were added to the mixture (rapid DNA ligation kit; Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada), followed by the incubation at room temperature for less than 1 h. The ligation products could be stored at 4 oC overnight before transformation of the competent cells. 37

2.9 Transformation of chemically competent cells The 5 L ligation product was added to 50 L of chemically competent (DH5) cells, and mixed gently on ice. The cells were chilled on ice for 30 min and then heat shocked at 42 oC for 30 s, followed by the room temperature recovery for 2 min. Then the competent cells were cultured in 1 mL SOC medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2 % tryptone, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 10 mM MgCl2 (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 10 mM MgSO4 (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and 20mM glucose (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada)) at 37 oC with 220 rpm agitation. After 1 h incubation, 200 L mixtures were plated on LB agar supplemented with antibiotics for overnight growth at 37 oC. Successful transformants were re-plated on fresh LB plates with antibiotics on the next day. The presence of plasmid construct from colonies that grew in the presence of antibiotics plates was confirmed through DNA sequencing (ACGT Company, Toronto, ON), and then transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (gift from Dr. Roberto Botelho's lab at Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada) for protein expression98.

2.10 YadK protein over-expression A single isolated colony of BL21 (DE3)/pET23d-yadK, 85170yadK

/pGEX-4T3-yadK or 85170yadK/pBlueScriptSK-yadK strains was incubated in fresh LB broth (with selective antibiotics) and cultured overnight at 37oC with agitation (225 rpm). The next day, the cultured bacteria were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB (with selective antibiotics) and re-cultured at 37 oC with agitation until OD600 38

approximated 0.6. IPTG (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (final concentration: 1 mM) was then added to induce YadK protein expression. Then 1 mL culture cells were collected every hour to assay the time-dependent protein expression level. The 5 mL culture without adding IPTG was used as negative control.

2.11 SDS-PAGE, Coomassie blue staining and Western blotting 1x SDS-PAGE Running Buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM Glycine and 0.1 % (w/v) SDS (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada)) and 1x transfer buffer (200 mL methanol (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 100 mL of 10 x running buffer and 700mL H2O) were prepared, respectively. The protein concentrations of samples were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). All samples were boiled with 5x sample loading buffer (10 % w/v SDS, 10 mM beta-mercapto-ethanol, 20 % v/v Glycerol, 0.2 M Tris-HCl of pH 6.8 and 0.05 % w/v Bromophenolblue (Bioshop, Burlington, ON, Canada)) and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gel (0.02 mL TEMED, 7.5 mL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl at pH 8.8, 0.15 mL of 20% (w/v) SDS, 12.0 mL Acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide (30%/0.8% w/v) (Bioshop, Burlington, ON, Canada), 0.15 mL 10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS) (Bioshop, Burlington, ON, Canada) and 10.2 mL H2O). For coomassie blue staining, SDS-PAGE gel was stained in Coomassie blue staining solution (0.1 % coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Bioshop, Burlington, ON, Canada), 50 % methanol and 10 % acetic acid) for 20 min at room temperature. Destaining solution (40 % methanol, 10 % acetic acid and 50 % H2O) was used to wash the gel 1 h until background of the gel 39

is fully destained; For Western blotting, protein bands without Coomassie blue staining were transferred from the gel to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The membrane was blocked with 5 % milk in 1xTBST (50 mM Tris Base, 0.9% NaCl, pH7.4, 1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4
o

C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1h at room temperature. The

primary antibodies are diluted in 1xTBST as follows: 1:1000 with anti-His antibodies (GE healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada), 1:1000 with anti-GST70K antibodies101 (gift from Dr. Clifford Lingwood's lab at Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto) and 1:400 with anti-YadK antibodies, respectively; the secondary antibodies are diluted in 1xTBST as follows: 1:10000 with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 1:30000 with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) and 1:10000 with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada), respectively. The ECL kit (GE healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada) and X-ray film (GE healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada) were used to detect the fluorescent signaling.

2.12 Protein extraction from BL21 (DE3) The 50 mL of IPTG-induced BL21(DE3)/pET23-yadK culture were centrifuged and the pellet was re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mg/mL lysozym (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 1 mg/mL DNase (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, 40

Canada), 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 M MgCl2 and 25 mM Tris at PH 8.0) for 30min on ice, followed by sonication at 50 % cycle for 15 min. Soluble and insoluble fractions of BL21 lysates were separated by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10min at 4 oC, and boiled with the sample loading buffer, respectively. Then the samples could be stored at -20 °C for future study.

2.13 Isolation of proteins from inclusion bodies As described above, the insoluble protein fraction could be acquired from the IPTG-induced BL21(DE3)/pET23-yadK lysates. The insoluble protein fraction was then re-suspended in 1x phosphate buffer (GE healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada) containing detergents (1 % Triton X-100 (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 1 % Tween-20 (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada) or 1 % SDS, respectively) for 30 min on ice. Soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min (4 oC). Soluble protein in 1 % SDS of 1x phosphate buffer was diluted with 1x phosphate buffer to decrease detergents concentration (till 0.02 % SDS of final concentration). 20 L soluble samples were boiled with the sample loading buffer and stored at -20 °C for future study.

2.14 Affinity column purification Since the recombinant YadK proteins carries a C-terminal polyhistidine tail that efficiently binds to nickel ions, affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (GE healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada) was used to purify the recombinant 41

YadK protein from inclusion bodies after SDS-treatment. Before purification, 10 mL of 1x binding buffer (20 mM Imidazole (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada)) was used to wash the resin column (GE healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada). The diluted soluble sample was loaded to the column and 10 mL 1x binding buffer was used to wash off the non-specifically bound samples. Finally, 3mL elution buffer (500 mM Imidazole) was used to elute T7-YadK-His proteins from the column. Figure 2.1 represents the YadK protein purification procedure.

2.15 Anti-YadK polyclonal antibodies generation The rabbit (purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA; housed at animal vivarium of Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada) was immunized with purified YadK (0.04 mg) three times at one month intervals. Blood was collected at 1 week before immunization and at 4 weeks after the 3rd immunization. Serum was isolated from clotted blood by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10min at 4 °C. The binding specificity of the anti-YadK in the serum was tested by Western blotting against YadK over-expressed in all of the indicated backgrounds (i.e. BL21 (DE3)/pET23d-yadK, 85170yadK/pGEX-yadK or 85170yadK/pSK-yadK). To eliminate non-specific binding of anti-YadK, three rounds of overnight incubation of anti-YadK antiserum with EDL933 yadK bacterial lysates on the blotting membrane, followed by one round of overnight incubation of BL21(DE3)/pET23d bacterial lysates on the blotting membrane, were performed, and we named these pre-absorbed anti-YadK antiserum as anti-YadK1. 42

2.16 Fimbrial sample preparation Bacteria cells were harvested by centrifuging at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4 oC. The pellet was re-suspended in 180 L acidic H2O (pH 1.5) and boiled for 5 min to disassemble the pilus structures55. Then the bacteria were boiled again for 5 min with 48 L of 5x Sample Buffer (10 % w/v SDS, 10 mM beta-mercapto-ethanol, 20 % v/v Glycerol, 0.2 M Tris-HCl of pH 6.8 and 0.05 % w/v Bromophenolblue (Bioshop, Burlington, ON, Canada)) and 1 M NaOH.

2.17 Acid stress treatment The acid treatment used for this study was adapted from the previously described methods90. A single isolated colony of EHEC or EHECyadK was grown in 10 mL LB broth (with or without 100 g/mL kanamycin) overnight at 37 C with agitation. The culture was diluted in 1:10 DMEM (pH 7.4) and grown at 37 C with 5% CO2 until OD600 reached about 0.4-0.6. Two mL of the culture was spun down by centrifugation, and the pellet was re-suspended and re-cultured in 10 mL DMEM (pH 5) with 25 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) (Bioshop, Burlington, ON, Canada) statically at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 1h. After acid adaptation, the culture medium was changed to 10 mL DMEM (pH 3) for acid shocking at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 30 min. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and prepared for Western blotting. The unstressed control was prepared using 10 mL of DMEM (pH 7) with 25 mM MOPS (3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid) (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada). 43

2.18 Preparation of electrocompetent cells Electrocompetent EHEC and EHEC EDL933/pDK46 were used for YadK over-expression and yadK mutant construct, respectively. A single isolated colony of the bacteria was cultured in to fresh 10mL LB broth (with or without antibiotics) and grown overnight at 37 oC with agitation. EDL933/pDK46 was always cultured at 30oC. The overnight culture was then diluted by 100 fold and re-cultured into fresh LB media with agitation. The bacteria were collected when an OD600 of 0.40 was reached. The cells were briefly chilled on ice for 15 min and harvested at 4000 g for 15 min at 4 oC. The cell pellet was gently re-suspended in 10 mL iced-cold sterile water and once again harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with 10mL of ice-cold sterile water once and 10 mL ice-cold 10% glycerol once, respectively. The cells were harvested as above, re-suspended in 10 mL ice-cold 10% glycerol and stored at -80 oC for future use.

2.19 Bacterial adhesion to host cells EHEC cells were initially pretreated with acid or neutral buffer as described above. Under either acid stress or unstressed treatment, EHEC cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was re-suspended in 1mL PBS, and 300 L of this cell solution was transferred to 1.5 mL eppedorf tubes and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was re-suspended with either 1 mL DMEM (Wisent, ST-BRUNO, Quebec, Canada), pre-immune serum (1:50 dilution) or anti-YadK antiserum (1:50), respectively, followed by the incubation at 37oC with 44

agitation for 1h. The volume of bacteria to be loaded to HEp-2 cells was determined by OD600 of bacteria.

One day before the adhesion assay experiment, HEp-2 cells were grown to 80% confluency in 25 cm2 flask and diluted into MEM (Wisent, ST-BRUNO, Quebec, Canada) (with no additives) to reach a cell count of 1x106 cells/mL. 500 L of these cells were aliquoted into each well of 24-well flat bottom plates (BD Falcon, Mississauga, ON, Canada). On the day of the adhesion assay, HEp-2 cells were counted again to determine the total volume of loading bacteria. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~100:1 (ratio of bacteria versus HEp-2 cells) was used for the experiments. HEp-2 cells were gently washed 3 times with 1x PBS. The appropriate volume of bacteria suspension in DMEM was added to HEp-2 cells, followed by the incubation at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 3-6 h. The culture media was gently removed from each well and HEp-2 cells were washed with 1x PBS after a 3 h infection period. DMEM was added to each well after washing. After a 6h infection period, HEp-2 cells and adherent EHEC cells were detached from the wells using 250L of trypsin-EDTA (Wisent, ST-BRUNO, Quebec, Canada) for 2-3 minutes at 37°C. Serial dilutions were prepared from each sample with PBS and 15 L of appropriate dilutions were plated on LB agar, followed by overnight culture at 37°C. The plates were quantified and the plates with 30~300 colonies were used to determine the amount of adherent bacteria.

45

2.20 Construction of the yadK deletion mutant in EDL933 A kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified from pKD4 vector by PCR, and the PCR products were confirmed on agarose gel and subsequently purified by gel extraction. Electrocompetent EHEC EDL933/pKD46 was made fresh according to above protocol. L-arabinose (final concentration: 0.2 %) was added into the subculture to induce recombinant enzyme expression. Then 50 L of

electrocompetent EHEC EDL933/pKD46 were transformed with 1L of purified PCR product of kanamycin resistance cassette. The cells were recovered with agitation of 220rpm for 1.5 h at 30 oC. 200 L of the culture was plated on LB agar plates (100 g/mL kanamycin) and grown overnight at 37oC. Successful mutants were confirmed by PCR.

2.21 Promoter activity assay Three predicted promoter regions (Figure 2.2) were selected for promoter activity assay using regulon database and compared with previous findings51, 92. The promoter activity assay was modified from the protocol as previously described102.

In brief, a single colony of an EHEC strain was inoculated in 3 mL of LB and grown overnight with shaking at 37 oC. Overnight culture media was sub-cultured into 10 mL of pre-warmed DMEM (pH 7.4) in a flask, followed by 2 h

46

culture. The 10 mL bacteria were transferred into 15 mL tubes, harvested at 3500 rpm for 7 min at 4 oC and re-suspended in 10 mL of pre-warmed DMEM (pH 5) and incubated statically at 37 oC with 5% CO2 for 1 h. Then these bacteria were harvested again and the pellets were re-suspended in 10 mL pre-warmed DMEM (pH 3) and incubated statically at 37 oC with 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then 1 mL culture was taken and spinned down for pellets that were kept at -20 degree. Later, the pellets were added with 40 L of chloroform, 20 L 1% SDS and 1 mL Z-buffer (0.06 M Na2HPO4, 0.04 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M KCl, 0.001 M MgSO4 and 0.05 M beta-mercaptoethanol; stored at 4 °C). The mixture was vortexed and allowed to settle for 10 min at 30 °C. 10 L of the bacterial supernatant and 70 L Z-buffer were transferred to 96 well-plates. 20 L of o-nitrophenyl--D-galactopyraniside (4 mg/mL suspended in Z-buffer; stored at 4°C (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada)) was added to the well. The OD414 was recorded with a plate reader and at the same time, protein concentration of bacteria extract was measured, in which 160 L bacterial samples or bovine serum albumin standard were mixed with 40 L Bio-Rad concentrate reagents, respectively, and kept for 5min at room temperature followed by AT OD595 detection. The -galactosidase activity was determined by the equation as below: Miller Units = (1500x OD420) / (T x ((Protein concentration x V)/1000)) where, OD414 is read from the reaction mixture. T = time of the reaction in minutes. V = volume of culture used in the assay in mLs. 47

2.23 Image J analysis The exposed X-ray films during Western blotting were scanned and the density of Western blotting bands was analyzed by Image J program. The ratio of density between band of interest and loading control were compared as follows:

Fold change of band intensity= (Intensity of sample band - intensity of adjacent background) / (Intensity of control band ­ intensity of adjacent background).

3. Results
3.1.1 Successful construction of pGEX-4T3-yadK vector To establish the yadK-expressing vectors, the pGEX-4T3 plasmid was selected, since this plasmid contains an N-terminal GST-tag, which can be used for subsequent YadK protein purification. First, the yadK segment amplified from EDL933 was inserted into pGEX-4T3 multiple cloning sites, and then the pGEX-4T3-yadK vector was transformed into DH5 competent cells, which were subsequently cultured on the Ampicillin (Amp)-positive LB plates. The plasmid DNAs were first isolated from 15 individual transformed colonies that grew on Amp+ plates, respectively, and then assayed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the presence of the yadK gene (Figure 3.1.1). One of the 15 PCR products amplified from plasmid extraction of DH5/pGEX-4T3-yadK displaying approximately 590bp band size was sequenced (Figure 3.1.2). 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17

3.1.2 GST-YadK was expressed in inclusion bodies in BL21 (DE3)

To express the YadK protein in vitro, the purified pGEX-4T3 vector carrying the correct yadK gene sequence was transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells. The plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones that grew on Amp+ plates and tested for the presence of yadK gene. Then, the BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pGEX-4T3-yadK vector were cultured, and IPTG was used to induce the expression of GST-YadK fusion protein.

The GST-YadK (48KDa) protein expression was first assayed by Coomassie blue staining of SDS-PAGE gel, which revealed that the GST-YadK protein expression reached the peak level around 4h after IPTG induction (Figure 3.1.3). Then the specificity of the GST-YadK protein was assayed by anti-GST-70K by Western blotting (Figure 3.1.4).

After the lysis of BL21 bacteria, Western blotting further revealed that most of GST-YadK protein was found in the insoluble fraction (Figure 3.1.5), and almost no GST-YadK was detectable in the soluble fraction (Figure 3.1.6).

3.2.1 Successful construction of pET23d-yadK As the YadK protein was expressed as inclusion bodies in the

BL21(DE3)/pGEX-4T3-yadK, it is difficult to purify the YadK protein from inclusion bodies. Thus, another yadK-expressing vector was constructed. Here, the pET23d plasmid that contains an N-terminal T7-tag and a C-terminal His-tag was selected. To construct the pET23d-yadK vector, PCR product of the full-length yadK fragment was inserted into the pET23d plasmid and then transformed into DH5 cells. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from 17 individual clones that grew from Amp+ plates, and tested for the presence of the yadK gene, respectively (Figure 3.2.1). The PCR products displaying approximately 590bp band size were purified and subjected to gene sequencing (Figure 3.2.2).

3.2.2 T7-YadK-His was also expressed as inclusion bodies in BL21 (DE3)

To express the T7-YadK-His protein, the pET23d-yadK vector carrying the yadK gene with the correct sequence was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. The presence of pET23d-yadK vectors in the transformed BL21(DE3) colonies was confirmed by PCR assay. Then IPTG was used to induce the YadK protein expression of these BL21(DE3)/pET23d-yadK bacteria. The His-YadK-T7 protein expression was assayed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 3.2.3) and Western blotting with the use of anti-His antibody, respectively (Figure 3.2.4). However, we found that after bacterial cell lysis, most of T7-YadK-His was still found in insoluble fraction of IPTG-induced BL21(DE3)/pET23d-yadK (Figure 3.2.5). 1 50KDa 36KDa 23KDa 22KDa 16KDa 2 3 4 5 6 7

3.2.3 T7-YadK-His purification from inclusion bodies As described above, the T7-YadK-His expression in the BL (DE3)/pET23d-yadK was present as the inclusion bodies. In order to make T7-YadK-His soluble, different kinds of detergents were employed. In brief, the insoluble sample from BL(DE3)/pET23d-yadK was re-suspended with various detergents (i.e. Tween-20, Triton X-100 or SDS), respectively. We found that the recombinant T7-YadK-His was best solubilised in 1% SDS, compared to Tween-20 or Triton X-100 (Figure 3.2.6). Then the solubilized YadK protein samples were diluted with binding buffer until 0.02% SDS was present, and then loaded to the Ni-NTA agarose beads, which can specifically bind to YadK-His fusion protein. Then the samples eluted by 500mM imidazole in 1X phosphate buffer from the Ni-NTA beads were collected. To test the purity of YadK-His protein, the eluted protein was assayed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 3.2.7) and Western blotting with the use of anti-His (Figure 3.2.8). These data suggested that the purified YadK-His protein was of high purity. 1 2 3 4 5

3.3 Successful construction of EDL933 yadK in EDL933

Recent reports suggest that EDL933 strain exhibit significantly more biofilm formation than other EHEC 0157:H7 strains, and better adhesion ability than other strains103-104. Consequently, a yadK mutant was constructed in EDL933 strain, using -Red recombinant system.

To disrupt YadK protein expression in EDL933 bacteria, EDL933 yadK was constructed by inserting a Kanamycin resistance cassette into yadK gene. PCR was performed to screen the EDL933 yadK clones grown on Kan+ plate (Figure 3.3.1). PCR products displaying approximately 1.8Kb band size were purified and sequenced (Figure 3.3.2). The sequencing alignment results demonstrated that EDL933 yadK mutant was successfully constructed. EDL933 yadK had been used in Figure 3.4.1 as a negative control for YadK expression in unstressed and acid-adapted acid stressed EDL933.

3.4 Increased YadK expression was observed under acid-adapted acid stress

Previous microarray studies in our lab found that the expression of yadK gene in EHEC, exhibited 5.87-fold increase after exposure to acid stress3. Increased expression of yadK mRNA in acid adapted acid stress was subsequently confirmed by quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), suggesting that this yadK gene is involved in the EHEC response to acid stress90. But it is unknown whether the expression of YadK protein in EHEC is up-regulated under acid stress.

To investigate the effects of acid stress on YadK protein expression in EHEC, Western blotting with anti-YadK polyclonal sera was employed to evaluate the YadK protein levels in EHEC under acid stress. In brief, bacterial lysates from EHEC acid-adapted acid (AA) stress group and unstressed (UU) group was pre-treated with acid H2O to dissemble pilus structure55. BL21(DE3)/T7-YadK-His was used as positive control. Results from three independent experiments revealed a more intense YadK band of 21.2KD size in the AA EHEC than in the UU EHEC. As loading control, chaperone protein DnaK (HSP70), was comparable between all AA and UU samples (Figure 3.4.1). With the use of Image J program to analyze the band density of YadK versus DnaK in Western blotting, we found that the YadK protein expression in EHEC acid-adapted acid stress group was significantly higher than that in EHEC un-stressed group (Figure 3.4.2).

Figure 3.4.2 Quantitative analysis revealed that the YadK protein level in EHEC AA group was significantly higher than that in EHEC UU group (P<0.05; n=3 per group). The band intensity in Figure 3.4.1 was quantitated by Image J program. The intensity of adjacent background was subtracted from the intensity of sample or control band, respectively. In each independent experiment, the ratio of blotting band intensity between YadK and DnaK in unstressed (UU) group was regarded as 1, when the ratio of YadK/DnaK was compared between UU and AA group. 66

3.5 Anti-YadK inhibits host adhesion of acid-stressed EHEC

In the absence of anti-YadK, acid stressed EHEC showed enhanced adhesion to HEp-2 cells, relative to unstressed EHEC. When acid stressed EHEC were pre-treated with anti-YadK, the adhesion to HEp-2 cells was reduced to the level of adhesion observed for unstressed EHEC (Figure 3.5). On the other hand, anti-YadK had no significant effect on the adhesion of unstressed EHEC. These results indicate that anti-YadK inhibits adhesion of acid stressed EHEC to human epithelial cells, suggesting a role for YadK in the adhesion enhancement of EHEC after acid stress.

3.6.1 Successful construction of predicted promoter constructs for yadK The pMC1403 plasmid, which contains a promoter-less LacZ gene, was used to make the promoter constructs with the predicted promoter regions that were involved in yadK gene expression. Three predicted promoter regions: PyadN, PyadM and PyadK (as indicated in Figure 2.2) were amplified by PCR and these PCR products were subsequently inserted into pMC1403 plasmid, respectively. The pMC1403 plasmids containing the potential promoter regions of yadK gene were then transformed into DH5 cells, followed by overnight culture on Amp+ plates. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from different clones that grew from Amp+ plates and subjected to PCR assay, respectively (Figure 3.6.1). The PCR products displaying approximately 500~600bp band size were purified and subjected to gene sequencing (Figure 3.6.2 A-C). Then the promoter constructs were purified from DH5  cells and transformed into EHEC 85170, which were subsequently used for -galactosidase assay. These data suggest that three putative promoter regions of yadK gene were successfully inserted into pMC1403 plasmids, respectively.

3.6.2 Up-regulation of promoter activity of PyadN was observed under acid-adapted acid stress

To determine the activity of yadK promoter under various stress conditions, EHEC 85170/pMC1403-PyadN, 85170/pMC1403-PyadM and 85170/pMC1403-PyadK were grown overnight and exposed to acid adapted acid stress (AA) and un-stressed (UU) treatments, respectively. We found that only PyadN activity (but not PyadM and PyadK) was significantly increased under acid adapted acid stress, compared to UA or UU treatments (Figure 3.6.3-5), suggesting that PyadN (the predicted promoter for whole operon) may be the potential promoter region for yadK gene.

4. Discussion
Acid stress is one of host defenses against foodborne pathogens. However, EHEC O157:H7 can survive passage through the acidic environment of GI tract due to their acid resistance system. An earlier mRNA microarray study has revealed that a variety of genes (including yadK) encoding virulent factors in EHEC were increased in response to the acid stress3. The increased gene expression under acid stress was also confirmed by Real-Time PCR. Disruption of yadK gene in EHEC resulted in the loss of acid-induced adhesion phenotype that was observed for wild-type EHEC O15790, suggesting that yadK gene played an important role in mediating acid-induced EHEC adhesion to host cells. However, to date there is still little knowledge regarding the potential role of YadK protein in the pathogenesis of EHEC. It is unknown whether YadK protein is directly involved in EHEC adhesion to host cells, or whether YadK functions as a regulator on the expression or/and assembly of certain adhesins (e.g. fimbriae). The hypothesis of this thesis is that acid stress up-regulates expression of the putative fimbrial protein YadK and that the YadK protein plays an essential role in the acid-induced adhesion of EHEC to host cells.

To address this hypothesis, three research objectives were established and subsequently pursued in order to evaluate the potential role of anti-YadK specific antiserum in EHEC adhesion to host cells. To prepare a YadK-specific antiserum, it was necessary to generate recombinant tagged YadK protein in the first place. Two plasmids, pET23d-yadK and pGEX-4T3-yadK were constructed. After transformation 75

into BL21 (DE3), recombinant T7-YadK-His and GST-YadK were abundantly expressed as inclusion bodies. Solubilization of the recombinant proteins required denaturation. Since the binding of GST-tag (but not His-tag) to Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads is significantly decreased under denaturing conditions, the His-tag expression system (pET23d plasmid) was used in the subsequent experiments, to purify YadK protein. Soluble T7-YadK-His was obtained from inclusion bodies by SDS detergent treatment, and the T7-YadK-His protein was purified by affinity chromatography. A polyclonal anti-YadK antiserum was generated by rabbit immunization with purified T7-YadK-His protein. The anti-YadK specifically recognized over-expressed YadK (21.2KD) in EHEC, GST-YadK (48KD) in EHEC, and T7-YadK-His (23KD) in BL21 (DE3) as determined by Western blotting (Figure 3.2.9-11), indicating the specific recognition of YadK by this anti-YadK antiserum.

To achieve objective II, EHEC wild-type and yadK mutant bacteria were treated under acid-adapted acid stress or unstressed conditions. The bacterial lysates were then prepared and subjected to Western blotting with anti-YadK polyclonal antibodies, to compare YadK expression level between UU and AA groups. In order to make an appropriate YadK negative control for EDL933 strain in Western blotting experiments, a yadK mutant was constructed in EDL933 strain, using -Red recombinant system. EDL933 yadK mutant was successfully constructed and subsequently used in Western blotting of Figure 3.4.1, as a YadK expression-negative control. Western blotting with anti-YadK revealed that the endogenous YadK 76

expression in unstressed EHEC was minimal and that expression was increased at least 2-fold by acid-adapted acid stress. This result suggested that YadK protein expression and possibly YadK fimbriae in EHEC may be up-regulated in response to acid stress.

We found that anti-YadK antibodies were able to significantly inhibit adhesion of acid-stressed EHEC to human epithelial cells, completely eliminating the acid-induced adhesion phenotype observed for wild type EHEC O157 (Figure 3.5). This provides convincing evidence that the YadK protein participates in the adhesion enhancement after acid stress and provides confirmation of the expression of YadK under acid stress.

To substantiate the finding of acid-induced up-regulation of yadK, different regions of the predicted yadK promoter region were cloned into the vector that contains a promoter-less lacZ gene. Promoter activities under various conditions (e.g. acid-adapted acid stress, unadapted acid stress and unstressed treatments) were measured. The results indicated the promoter activity for the whole operon PyadN, but not for PyadM or PyadK, was enhanced under the acid-adapted acid treatment (Figure 3.6.2).

Recent reports have identified two regulators involved in regulation of yad operon expression, H-NS and AI-292-93. With the studies of the fimbrial operon in K12, the 77

yad operon promoter activity was found significantly increased in hns mutant compared to wild type, which indicated H-NS could repress yad operon transcript92. According to DNA microarray analysis, yadN, the major subunit gene in locus 2 was increased more than 23-fold in the hns mutant compared to wild type67. Many studies have suggested H-NS may play a repressive function in fimbrial expression in E. coli, which suggests H-NS may negatively regulate yadK expression in EHEC67. The in vitro studies demonstrate that yadK was induced by AI-2 signaling93. The yadK gene was identified as one of the genes that responded to differential AI-2 concentration in culture media. Both yadK and locus 2 major subunit yadN showed a significant increase under the high AI-2 concentrations conditions93. It has been reported that the presence of AI-2 in culture media influenced the expression of yadK in EHEC O157:H7 strains97. Several genes involved in AI-2 signaling had been reported to be up-regulated under acid stress, indicating the regulation of yadK by AI-2 may be related to acid stress.

In summary, we found that YadK protein expression is up-regulated by acid stress and that YadK plays a role in acid-induced adhesion of EHEC to human epithelial cells. These results suggest that anti-YadK antibodies may be a potential therapeutic target against EHEC infection, and YadK protein could be the target for a potential vaccine in humans. Anti-YadK antibodies may also be used in the food industry to diminish the potential EHEC infection. This study provides the first evidence of an EHEC adhesin specifically expressed after acid stress and may provide a new insight into the 78

pathogenic mechanism of EHEC, particularly after gastric passage. A model for this mechanism is proposed in Figure 4.1.

5. Future Directions
Future work on this project should include the characterization of the structure and expression regulators of Locus 2 fimbriae in EHEC. This study provides two different YadK-tagged expression vectors, the specific anti-YadK antibodies and

EDL933yadK strain. Biofilm formation using EDL933, EDL933yadK and possible complementary strains could be assessed to determine the role of YadK in microcolony formation.

YadK is predicted to be the minor subunit of Locus 2 fimbrial operon, and the transcription level of minor subunit ( i.e.YadK) is usually much less than that of major subunit (i.e.YadN of Locus 2 fimbriae). Therefore, the generation of an anti-YadN antiserum may be more effective for characterization of possible fimbrial structures in EHEC through electro microscopy.

Studies have suggested that H-NS plays a repressive function in the expression of fimbrial structure in E. coli, which suggests H-NS may also negatively regulate yadK expression in EHEC. Three promoter constructs (pMC1403-PyadN,

pMC1403-PyadM and pMC1403-PyadK) made in this study could be used to transform the EDL933hns mutant and assess the role of H-NS in YadK expression.

80

AI-2 in culture media has been reported to influence yadK expression in EHEC O157:H7 strains97. Several genes involved in AI-2 signaling had been reported to be up-regulated in acid stress, which indicates the regulation of yadK by AI-2 may be related to acid stress. AI-2 experiment could be performed to determine the AI-2 activity under various stresses (e.g. acid-adapted acid stress, un-adapted acid stress and no-acid stress). Future studies could be performed to investigate the regulation of AI-2 on other fimbrial gene expression (i.e. yagZ and lpfA).
