Implementing Participatory Research within a northern Ontario First Nations Community Introduction

in which the world is understood by First Nations themselves. Space must be created that does
not only invite First Nations perspectives, but is fully reflective of First Nations perspectives.
Decolonization involves detecting the power imbalance that creates inequity and oppression, recognizing the harm that has been inflicted through colonization, and ensuring First Nations

For more than 500 years, the voices of First Nations people have been silenced through the dominant culture's insistence to remain in power (Gaikezehongai, 2003). Assimilation tactics have been embedded in policies that enforce the reiteration of western values and assumptions as a means to ensure western self-preservation. Colonization involved governments using

disempowerment of those who remain in privileged positions while at the same time empowering those who have been marginalized (Sonn & Green, 2006).

assimilative processes to expunge First Nations traditional world views and culture. Many of
these processes have been compared to cultural genocide (Thomas & Green, 2007).

As a result, First Nations world perspectives have been invisible in social policy. The acts and treaties created by governments to assimilate First Nations have left a legacy of poverty and
placed First Nations people in a vulnerable position (Sinclair, 2004). Presently, living conditions in fly-in First Nations reserves are considered the poorest in Canada (Bennett & Blackstock, 2007). Every day, First Nations communities face the challenge of living in poverty and finding hope for a future in a system that promotes oppression. In 2005, the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, the Honourable James K. Bartleman, instituted the Summer of Hope Literacy Camps within 23 northern fly-in reserves in Ontario.

This research paper refers to participatory evaluation research (PER) as a method of decolonization. I will evaluate the initial stages of implementing PER within a northern Ontario

First Nations community. PER values the community members as the experts in determining the
worth of the programs and services available to them (King, 1998). PER, in general, invites community members to form a research team. The research team is then encouraged to outline locally specific goals and outcomes for programs (Cousins & Whitmore, 1998). As a facilitator, the researcher supports the team in developing methods of evaluation. This enables the community research team to determine the effectiveness of programs in response to community

Nations children and youth. A process of decolonization must be enacted in order to reverse the effects of

expectations. As a method, PER has the potential to move away from the western ambition to assimilate First Nations people by creating program goals entrenched in First Nations world
perspectives. The process of decolonization is facilitated when programs are evaluated against
First Nations community values as opposed to western values. As a participant observer (PO), I evaluated the process of initiating PER within a remote

western as the "other" while valuing First Nations world views. Decolonization requires the

and writing. Instead, First Nations literacy is most often seen as the development of the wholeness of self and not just the cognitive processes involved in literacy (Archibald, Antone, &
Blair, 2003). The process of requiring First Nations literacy skills is transformative in nature, as

it focuses on the connectedness between the ".. .spirit, heart, mind and body," whereby educating the mind, you educate the whole spirit (Antone, 2003, p. 21).

The subject of this major research project is an evaluation of the forming stage using methods of participatory observation. I was accompanied by my supervising professor from a south Ontario university who is in the beginning stages of implementing PER within the community. The supervising professor oversaw the research study and reviewed my field notes for accuracy and bias. The process of group formation will be reviewed using Tuckman's (1965) stages of group development. This study is intended to be a template for future PER projects

Nations communities. However, there is a startling lack of services available to young children in these communities. Louise Brown, education reporter for the Toronto Star, noted that, "Three quarters of students here show special needs, yet there is only one special education teacher.

There are no regular visits by social workers, no literacy experts, no speech pathologists, no
professional development" (Brown, 2005). This article was part of a response to Star's series

In the north, teachers without the qualifications expected in south Ontario are hired, teacher aids with no training in special needs work with identified children, and young children who experience the suicide of loved ones and who struggle with the hopelessness poverty brings

When considering the public education system in Ontario and the success and failure of First Nations children, it is impossible to ignore the lingering historical remaining effects from the residential school system (Van Der Woerd & Cox, 2003; Riecken, Tanaka, & Scott, 2006). The residential schooling system was derived from an educational policy put into place to assimilate First Nations people. The public education system also has been responsible for the process of assimilating First Nations world views, language, cultural and spiritual values, as its objectives have been to ensure assimilation through silencing First Nations presence (Antone, 2000). By ignoring the voice of First Nations people, the dominant culture remains in power and

deconstruct a particular way of looking at the world and the meanings attached to concepts. The concept of literacy, for example, may shift away from the western value of print where literacy equals intelligence and ".. .illiteracy equals incompetence" to include First Nations values of
literacy (Rasmussen, 2001, p. 107).

Bureaucratic Disentitlement ofServices

addressing the poor living conditions on northern Ontario First Nations reserves. Structural

communities to services meant to benefit populations in meaningful ways. Lipsky (1984) explained bureaucratic disentitlement as the unseen, undetected, subtle ways in which federal government statute is manipulated by front-line workers. Intentional or unintentional
manipulation of statute often results in the retrenchment of services. The term retrenchment

Wilson and Wilson (2002) have explored current literature concerning the value of integrating First Nations education into mainstream systems. They recognize the current educational system as a system that represents the dominant culture's value system and
ideologies to be taught to children and youth to ensure its longevity (Wilson & Wilson, 2002).

describes the curtailing of services that result in a reduction of the quality of service provided, often not meeting the needs of the target group (Ingram, 1991).

Wilson and Wilson (2002) claim fusing eurocentric curriculum with First Nations world views is

In Ontario reserves, this means retrenchment strategies hinder the deliverance of services
to those who require them, making it challenging or impossible to create positive change.
Budgetary cuts and policy that is oversubscribed are often the root issues of retrenchment (Ingram, 1991). Policy has been oversubscribed when too many target groups qualify for the

system, social inequities are often the result of issues of disentitlement (Lens, 2007).

Bureaucratic disentitlement is a disempowering process that creates a sense of helplessness.
Bureaucratic disentitlement becomes more evident on northern Ontario First Nations reserves where the literacy rate is lagging behind the rest of Canada (Ontario Native Literacy
Coalition [ONLC], 2003). Discouragement tactics of bureaucracy result in slowing progress on

same service (Ingram, 1999). When agencies are not able to meet client needs, often governmental officials allow agencies wider discretion to determine who is the very most eligible. Discretion comes with a substantial cost, as it may mean clients for whom the statute was created may be denied services or will receive services where most likely quality has been
compromised (Lens, 2005).

reserves, creating a sense of hopelessness, and securing a dependency on the system that
perpetuates poverty (Sossin, 2006). Lack of literacy skills increases the difficulty in meeting

bureaucratic requirements, such as filling out forms, writing proposals, writing complaints, and
so on. To master the bureaucratic system, one must have the skills to complete the proper forms, as the primary concern of a bureaucratic system is to comply with its requirements (Keohan,
2008).

Bureaucracies aim to move citizens away from dependence on the state by tightening

entitlement and eligibility guidelines (Sossin, 2006). Tougher sanctions increase the number of people disentitled to services, thus removing them from government benefit rolls (Sossin, 2006). The more interviews required to attend, the more letters to answer, the more forms to complete in order to prove eligibility and entitlement will increase the chances of people failing to meet
requirements (Sossin, 2006).

Effects of Colonization on Present-Day First Nations Children

Poverty has become the legacy of colonization as First Nations communities became

dependent on the state. Bennett and Blackstock (2007) referred to poverty as the new form of colonization, as ".. .it overtakes the spirit, physical, emotional wellbeing and negatively affects

assumes social justice is a structural dynamic in delivering service. However, bureaucratic

social and political institutions, and racial discrimination that has damaged sense of identity. As a result, First Nations youth are predisposed to suicide, self-injury, and other self-destructive
behaviour (Advisory Group on Suicide Prevention, 2003). Northern remote communities in

Canada experience a suicide rate of up to 6% above the national suicide rate average of non-First Nations people (French, 2004). Rates of youth suicide are alarmingly higher than the national
average of the suicide rates of non-First Nations young people. First Nations male youth are five times more likely to commit suicide and First Nations females are eight times more likely to commit suicide than their non-First Nations counterparts (Advisory Group on Suicide
Prevention, 2003).

Self-Esteem as the Moderator between Depression and Suicide

Poverty and depression are highly correlated (Patel, Flisher, Nikapota, & Malhotra, 2007). In a large study of adolescent risk behaviour, Wild, Flisher, and Lombard (2007) found
depression and self-esteem to be highly correlated. It was found that self-esteem may act as a moderator between depression and suicide--with a high self-esteem guarding the individual's mental health and a low self-esteem compromising mental health (Wild et al, 2007). Growing up in a context of poverty exposes children to the many variables that put them at risk for

The statistical data available for Canadian First Nations youth suicide rates does not illustrate the extent of daily living that is faced within a context of poverty, shortage of housing, unemployment, and access to affordable food and clean water as communities face on remote fly-in reserves in northern Ontario. Canadian First Nations children are the most impoverished
children in Canada, with one in two Aboriginal children living below the poverty line (Morris,
2007; Bennett & Blackstock, 2007).

stated, ".. .the stress associated with economic hardship and poverty is associated with increased risk for the development of children's depressive symptoms" (p. 831).
Young people do not wake up with high or low self-esteem. As children mature, they

Youngs outlined six variables of self-esteem, "...a sense of physical safety, a sense of emotional security, a sense of identity, a sense of belonging, a sense of competence and a sense of purpose" (p. 63). Young children will acquire a sense of high or low self-esteem in accordance to the degree to which the described variables are met. As children and youth create their identity and sense of belonging, they require verbal and non-verbal messages that tell them they are valued, cared for, and safe. First Nations families in remote northern Ontario communities struggle with generations of cultural loss, battle
with daily living within a context of poverty, and search for hope within a context of oppression.

First Nations children and youth are at a greater disadvantage of acquiring a low self-esteem and
internalizing attitudes of learned hopelessness.
With poverty and unemployment rates extremely high on reserves, First Nations youth have little hope in finding a job. A lack of healthy food and clean water makes children and youth vulnerable to disease, stunted physical growth, and brain maturation. A lack of medical and counselling services on northern reserves fails to provide children and youth with the support and immediate services so taken for granted in south Ontario (Bennett & Blackstock, 2007).
Households experience overcrowding due to a lack of housing units.

opportunities that increase self-esteem. Affiliation with the school provides a sense of belonging
to the school community, and these youth are more likely to aspire to continue their education.
According to the results of this study, it appears that staying in school increases self-esteem and provides hope for the future. Arnau, Rosen, Finch, Rhudy, and Fortunato (2007) have determined
hope to be an attribute that acts as a motivator for youth to pursue future goals. Having hope seems to buffer against depression and suicidal ideation. In exploring the effects of hope on depression, Chang and DeSimone (2001) found individuals who reported

being hopeful had less incidence of psychological maladjustment to the stresses of daily living.
Individuals who experience a sense of hope experienced less depression than those who did not experience hope. Having a sense of hope and high self-esteem seem to act as protective factors against depression and suicidal ideation.

Gaikezehonga ( 2003) describes her memories of when she was growing up on reserve: Although I have always known that I am Anishnabekwe, I can recall thinking and feeling at 8 years old that I was basically born at the bottom rung of the latter of society. By the time I was 14, such thoughts and feelings remained internalized within while enough of my peers killed themselves, (p. 42) Canadian First Nations children and youth are likely to receive messages from their environment indicating their health and well-being is not of significance. When First Nations youth compare their well-being to non-First Nations youth, it is unlikely they sense a feeling of affiliation, competence, and mission, which are requirements for positive self-esteem (Youngs, 1993). Van Der Woerd and Cox (2003) conducted a study to explore how educational status is associated with risk-specific factors and protective factors for First Nations youth. They found

Summer ofHope Literacy Camps

The then Lieutenant-Governor, the Honourable James K. Bartleman, initiated the
Summer of Hope Literacy Camps in 2005 as a means of fostering hope for First Nations children and youth. The intent of the Lieutenant-Governor's initiative was to boost literacy skills among First Nations children by providing literacy camps in remote First Nations communities. He worked with local leaders to institute the camps and partnered with Frontier College, Canada's longest-serving literacy organization, to deliver the program.

that youth who have poorly attended school reported a low sense of self-esteem and were more likely to be involved in risky behaviour. It was also found that youth who stayed in school and
attended regularly reported a higher sense of self-esteem (Van Der Woerd & Cox, 2003). Youth who remain in school sense a connectedness to school and are in a position to experience

within the communities. The Honourable James Bartleman's objective of the summer literacy camps is to boost
children's self-esteem through improved literacy and to provide learning through fun activities that encourage future participation in school. As research has previously indicated; participation in school increases a sense of self-esteem and the hope of attaining desired educational goals. As

quoted by Grand Chief Stan Beardy of Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN):
If we are to ask our young people of their dreams and goals, we must ensure that we can

provide the vehicle for them to get there. If we are to ask them to reach for the stars, we must provide them the telescope to look through. The Summer of Hope camps open doors.. .and make dreaming possible. (Frontier College, 2007). There is research that indicates that there is loss of learning due to summer vacation, and
the loss is greater for children who live in a lower socio-economic class (Cooper, Nye, Charlton, Research to Decolonize versus Research to Marginalize western research conducted within First Nations communities has created a relationship

stripped of their world views, culture, spirituality and language. The word research represents western systems of acquiring knowledge that has historically ".. .meant...violation, disrespect, subjectivism, and intolerance..." toward First Nations (Pidgeon & Cox, 2002, p. 99). Research also implies that First Nations are not capable of dealing with the problems that
colonization has produced (Menzies, 2001). Linda Smith (1999), in her book Decolonizing Methodologies, described the effects western research has had on colonization by recognizing

Karl, Entwisle, Entwisle, and Olson (2001) also acknowledged seasonal influence on inequity in school achievement and found that disadvantaged children keep up throughout the school year but experience learning loss over the summer months. This study suggested that a summer

Magee, Inesi, and Gruenfeld (2006), in the article Power and Perspectives not Taken, studied the
relationship between power and perspective taking. Power is understood as the ".. .capacity to
influence other people; [which] emerges from control of resources and the ability to administer rewards and punishments" (Galinsky et al, 2006, p. 1068). They found that power is associated
with the difficulty in taking the perspective of the less powerful. People, such as those in power
of the dominant culture, are more likely to not take the perspective of those who are less powerful. In having control over "valuable resources," the powerful are less dependent on others and do not have to consider their perspectives (Galinsky et al., 2006, p. 7). Perspective taking is seen as empathizing with another's experience by ".. .imagining the emotions, perceptions, and motivations of another individual..." (Galinsky et al, 2006, p. 7). It was discovered that having

institutions and researchers may not be as readily accepted on reserves. Years of exploitation and
appropriation have left a sense of mistrust of western methods of research on the part of First

Nations communities. The Tri-Council Policy Statement on ethics is beginning to recognize and
address the past abuse of powers by researchers. It acknowledges that researchers have, in the
past, exploited First Nations. The Tri-Council is currently designing policy that will ensure

ethical principals, standards, and procedures are written in policy. Among the several

recommendations are to include First Nations communities to be part of the research design and
to ensure multiple First Nations perspectives are expressed (Tri-Council Policy Statement
[TCPS], 1998).

power without perspective taking increases the possibility of stereotyping and racism, whereas

the ability to take the perspectives of others allows individuals to value others (Davis, Conklin,
Smith, & Luce, 1996).

The process of colonization lacked perspective taking as the dominant culture created

is not recognized within the western mainstream (Hart, 2007). In order to encourage a process of
decolonization, it is essential for the executors of mainstream knowledge to unlearn ways of

In unlearning ways of thinking, the "white privileged" must first".. .see other ways of

knowledge (King, 2007). Within this forum, it is the First Nations community that creates the
direction of the knowledge to be produced (Cousins & Whitmore, 1998). In this way, PER encourages First Nations to gain control of resources that impact their lives (Suarez-Balcazar, 2005). PER provides a sense of hope and less dependency on bureaucratic systems as First Nations communities move away from dependency toward self-reliance (Christopher, Watts,
Knows, McCormick, & Young, 2008).

methods is entrenched with assumptions that support western ideologies (Piercy & Volker, 1998). The theories derived from this knowledge create discourse of theory and practice that perpetuate and strengthen dominant world views while excluding the views of those who are oppressed (Suarez-Balcazar, 2005). In creating community-based research teams, PER provides the space to tailor research to produce practices that are meaningful to those in which the research directly affects (Piercy & Volker, 1998).

It has been demonstrated that it is essential for First Nations communities to design program goals, outcomes and evaluation methods based on indigenous world views and community needs (Menzies, 2001). In doing so, First Nations communities work in collaboration with outside agencies to ensure governmental programs and policies are meeting First Nations
community needs as determined by the community. PER encourages the building of trust as it

PER finds it roots in participatory action research, which is part of community-based research in which research is conducted with communities and not on communities (Washington,

who share an interest of the entity being evaluated (Cousins & Whitmore, 1998). A research
team is formed from community members who participate as equal partners in all aspects of research. Research teams formulate goals for community programs, and university collaborators provide information the research team may find useful when evaluating program outcomes. The function of the researcher is to invite community members to form the team and to relinquish
power to the members of the community (Smulyan, 1987).

The Role of the Participant Observer The aim of the study is to realize the effectiveness of implementing PER within a

input from those who the research directly affects. However, when PER is used within the context of decolonization, it implies the reallocation of power in constructing new knowledge

based on First Nations community values (Cousins & Whitmore, 1998). PER becomes a
transformative process because social change is made possible with the construction of new

duration of four days and three nights. The three visits were carried out over a four-month

the scholar wishes to understand the actions of people it is necessary for him to see their objects

motivational attunement to the group's concerns" (p. 372). As I attuned with the groups

The relationship between the PO and the research team needs to reflect the common

understanding of a shared perspective (Menzies, 2001). I adopt the transformative potential of PER as a personal paradigm (Cousins & Whitmore, 1998). I made every effort to disclose personal thoughts and opinions to ensure the meaning I was creating was derived from observations that reflected the perspectives of community members (Kemp, 2001). I kept a journal in order to document feelings and thoughts that occurred throughout the day.
A case study approach requires extensive data collection (Cresswell, 1998). I kept

In order to strive for social betterment, I must practise perspective taking so that I learn to I see their concern and understand their values in ways that are locally specific to the

In striving for social betterment, it is imperative to realize that evaluation is not made in
isolation. Evaluation is made within existing structures. These structures represent western

PER requires the development of a group that will work together to assess community

programs. Bruce Tuckman (1965), an educational psychologist, observed the behaviour of small group to determine the ways in which they form. From his research, Tuckman identified four stages he believed groups need to move through before teams become as effective as they can be.
Building Trust and Friendship

In PER it is essential the group be developed within a context of trust. Trust allows members to feel comfortable expressing their perspectives and ensures active participation (Fetterman, 2001). Trust takes on a deeper meaning when PER is implemented within a First

than the community itself. In implementing PER on a northern Ontario fly-in First Nations community, the researcher must ensure that participatory research is an approach rather than a

In his article, Tuckman (1965) did not stipulate how long each stage will take. The time it takes for teams to reach the next stage is unpredictable (Runkel, Lawrence, Oldfield, Rider, & Clark, 1971). Each stage progresses as members establish themselves and their roles within the

that desire to establish a sense of trust within a First Nations community must carefully take into
consideration the historical abuse First Nations people have endured through western research methods. Every effort must be made to listen to community members and be present within the community as an alley.

what one says one will do, and not be judgmental. Creating an atmosphere of genuine care is a
core ingredient for establishing a sense of trust (Christopher, Watts, Knows, McCormick, & Young, 2008). Considering the contextual history of western research on First Nations communities, establishing trust needs to be nurtured with a genuine and open presence in the
community.

Walking in the community, saying hello to children, waving at people driving and
walking by, helping out whenever possible, attending community events, and expressing genuine interest in the community are essential acts that demonstrate care and concern that spread far beyond the scope of PER. Becoming familiar within the community establishes trusting

commitment required from the researcher in respecting the development process of the
community in establishing trust. This paper focuses on the initial stages of PER within a First Nations community. The goal of this PER project is to establish a research team made up of community members who will design the goals for their local Summer of Hope Literacy Camps and choose methods of evaluation (King, 1998). However, the research team did not form by western expectations. The team emerged as community members established a sense of trust with us. This paper will highlight the journey we took together as we established trust and friendship with community members. It was out of trusting relationships that it was possible to
form research team.
First Visit

made arrangements for us to stay in the teacherage.
With each trip, we paid a visit to the Chief and Band Council. Although request for permission to visit had previously been granted by the Chief, my supervisor felt that it was a sign of respect to greet him in person. In the community, I observed, it is a sign of respect to remove your shoes when entering someone's home. My supervisor and I offered this sign of respect upon entering all dwellings and businesses, including the Chief and Band Council office,

During each visit, it was important that we walked around the community to make our presence known. We made deliberate effort to wave and smile at drivers passing by as we walked along the roads of the community. The majority of drivers and children in cars or trucks waved back. Through my observations, I identified a variety of responses received by drivers as we said hello and waved and smiled at community members. Some drivers lifted their arm up and waved as they looked at us, others simply lifted their fingers off the wheel, and some nodded their heads in acknowledgment. Those who recognized us waved longer or slowed down to say hello and those we befriended stopped and talked. As we walked along the roads, children
walking by or riding their bikes said hello to us. Some children initiated conversations, asking us

Upon arriving for the first visit, the gentleman we shall name Peter who was supposed to pick us up from the airport and bring us to the hotel did not meet us. As my supervisor and I

community members ranging from obvious to subtle gestures. There was no evidence of us being unwelcomed or in danger. In fact, while being outsiders, we felt very cared for in the community. On the first day, my supervisor and I set out to find John, who is a community member my supervisor knew previously and is the reason this community was chosen to implement PER. Once we found John, he and my supervisor reacquainted themselves and made a plan to connect with each other at some point during our stay.
On our way back to the teacherage, Peggy, whom my supervisor knew from a previous visit in the community, stopped her van to speak with us. Peggy teaches in the local school. My supervisor and Peggy had a conversation in which Peggy agreed to be a research team member

for an hour as we discussed her work and the commitment she has to her students. Sally spoke of
how she works hard with the children who struggle. She spoke of how the ability to struggle it
out sometimes helps the children make it through okay. Both Sally and John attended university

and are highly respected by the youth in the community. My supervisor explained the purpose of
our visit to Sally. Sally thought it was a good idea to form a team and committed to joining.

While we were in the store, a friend of Sally entered. After talking for a bit, this woman agreed
to join the team.

Spending time in a community store where there is constant stream of community members was another way for us to establish a connection within the community. Unlike a variety store in the south, where customers purchase something and leave, this store was set up
as a community hub. John spoke of the care and concern he had for the community, especially

and asked for advance notice for the initial meeting so she could make childcare arrangements. That same afternoon we made ourselves visible in the community by crossing the bridge to an island rich in history to the community members. We hoped that exploring the community in depth demonstrated that we valued and respected the community beyond the scope of the PER project. We asked two young children who were swimming in the lake for directions to the bridge. The boys were helpful and descriptive. On our way back to the teacherage, Peter drove by and stopped to speak with my supervisor. Peter is Peggy's sister and also works in the local school. Peter is working as a community program consultant for the project and assists my supervisor as a contact person in

the youth. John designed the store intentionally to be a local gathering place. More than just a
store to purchase a snack, it was a place to connect with others. It had three long rectangular

tables with chairs set up around a flat-screen TV for community members (especially youth) to
gather. People purchased snacks, refreshments, homemade pizza, and grocery items, including

meat, canned goods, and frozen foods. As we stayed in the store, we said hello to customers,
smiled, waved, and sometimes talked with young children. We shared our experiences and
answered questions about where we were from, why we looked different, and what we were
doing there.

On the second day, Peter arranged to introduce my supervisor to the community over the

school that evening for the meeting and waited patiently for community members to arrive. As we were waiting, Peter mentioned that he understood that schools in the south sometimes complain of swimming pool closures. He said that up here they don't have pools in the school, and some communities don't have schools. It was discouraging that evening that no one attended
the meeting. We had overlooked the fact that there was a community memorial service being
held at the same time.

enjoyed the weeks in camp. Community members were always open to join the team, but it was
difficult to organize a meeting with them. We walked back to the teacherage afterwards with a dog we befriended on our earlier

walks. The next morning we prepared to leave. As we waited for our ride to the airport, John drove by with his grandson to say goodbye and to ensure we had a ride to the airport. As we sat

on the porch with John and his grandson, Sam also drove by to let us know what time our plane
left and to offer us a ride. My supervisor thanked him and ensured him that a ride for us was arranged.

We left the school and Peter drove us to his sister Peggy's coffee store. Peggy's store is

similar to John and Sally's store. Both stores are deliberately designed to welcome the commuity in to sit and talk with each other. We sat in a room with four sets of thick, lacquered pinewood rectangular tables with six matching chairs. A glass display case had homemade

Sam expressed his concern for his children, hoping for them to do well in school. Sam expressed interest in joining the team. At this point, recruitment was slow as individuals reflected on the pros and cons ofjoining, but the team
was forming. In this forming stage, it appeared that the initiator is more invested in the team than the members (Cousins & Whitmore, 1998). Community members responded to the invitation join the research team in a variety of ways. All members smiled, nodded their head, and were very open to the idea of forming a research team to evaluate the literacy camps. All members we

Teams from neighbouring communities on northern Ontario reserves participated in this tournament. My supervisor and I watched the games and cheered on members of the team. We were able to deepen relationships and establish
new friendships.

two children who expressed interest in joining the team during our first visit, stopped his van to say hello and asked us when the first meeting would take place. My supervisor told Sam that there was no meeting, and we all laughed a little about it. Sam expressed his interest in joining
the team again.

we arrived at the, Sally spoke to us about her father and mother and the memories she shared on
the land we were on.

We were very fortunate to share this experience with Sally. I felt for a moment that there

was no divide between us at all. But we were reminded that as governments created policy to
promote assimilation, and research advanced western knowledge, First Nations communities became marginalized and segregated (Pidgeon, 2002). I could not help but feel that the divide between First Nations and western worlds was created because we ignored their perspectives.

The relationship between Sally and my supervisor was strengthened during the second visit. As we disembarked from our flight, Sally and John were at the airport picking up groceries and supplies for the store that had just been flown in. Sally was very happy to see my supervisor and waved her over to her truck. Sally mentioned she wanted to talk to my supervisor regarding a
personal matter and invited us to her home the next day.

Third Visit

Seven weeks later, my supervisor and I returned for a third time. Peter greeted us at the

The next day, as we were walking to watch the community baseball event, Peggy, who committed last time to join the team, stopped her van to welcome us back and ask us when the
first meeting would be. The team was continuing to form as members of the community continued to express an interest in joining the team. During the second visit, my supervisor
compiled a list of twelve community members who were interested in participating.

evening; postings were up at the local store; and all members had been contacted.

On the first evening, we walked to Peggy's store to say hello and spend some time with her, but the store was not open. We walked to John's store, where we were warmly greeted by
John. John was there with his daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Sally came in and was surprised and happy to see my supervisor. We chatted for a little until Sally mentioned that she needed to leave for a moment to pick up her mother and bring her back to her home. Sally
invited us to her home later to meet her mother.

We then visited Sally and sat on her back porch talking a bit about the research team and

the work that Sally does. Sally seemed to feel very comfortable to have us in her backyard as she
discussed personal matters with us. The last evening of our second visit, as we were sitting at the table in Peter and Sally's store, Sally decided to take my supervisor and me for a ride to sacred

by inviting us into her life in a meaningful way. Sally's mother was sitting on the sofa in the living room wearing pyjamas. Her hair was long, mostly grey with traces of black running through it. She did not speak English but welcomed us with a big, warmhearted smile and gentle handshake. As we were talking, Sally showed us a picture of her father, who had passed away. We talked about Sally's mother's

children named the different types of gems they were studying. We praised the children for their

John explained this is why First Nations do not fight back. As children they were taught to respect the treaty. The treaty provided provision of land but did not prepare communities to survive within a context they were not familiar with and where they were clearly being taken
advantage of. John further explained that if slaves are not fully prepared to survive upon being set free, they might ask for slavery back because at least with that they knew what to do and what to expect. Slaves understand how to function in their environment; they have the knowledge of how to survive in their circumstance. The Indian Act dictated all aspects of the "Indian" life.

was provided; and we waited in anticipation. Peggy was the first to show up and quickly began
sharing her views with my supervisor. She told us she felt the community had issues with colonialism, mentioning that the young people are learning about it and they understand its effects. There is a sense of frustration as the community sees many white people come and go, and nothing really changes. Peggy stated the importance of starting meetings with prayer, as prayer provides a blessing and direction. She explained the importance of including elders in prayer, to provide counselling. Peggy asked for a mission statement of the literacy camps and the

job descriptions of the counsellors that run them.

supervisor and inform her of the next meeting date.

visit. I told Sally that I have received so much and have given nothing. I told Sally that I have grown to care about her and the community and that I think about her when I am in Toronto. In a very comforting and assuring manner, Sally nodded her head and told me it was all okay. In a prior conversation, John told me that he believed I would be able to make some sort of change.

is highly enforced with a repeating message aired on the loud speaker informing people not to leave bags unattended. In Pearson Airport, the metal detectors seem to have a higher sensitivity

than airports in northern Ontario. For example, I always had to remove my shoes when walking
through the metal detector at Pearson because the metal tabs on my shoes activated the system. However, in the Thunder Bay airport, the metal detector was never activated in the same way. In

Pearson Airport, I had to remove my shoes, was scanned with a wand, and my carry-on bags were X-rayed and searched. When at the Thunder Bay airport travelling north, I was able to walk right by security to the plane without showing identification. As a matter of fact, on all three occasions, there was no one present at the security desk. We held our carry-on bags without them
being searched. At Thunder Bay, upon boarding the airplane to Sioux Lookout for the first time,

and I had a coffee with Peggy. I told Peggy that this would be my last visit and I would not
return with my supervisor next time. Peggy said that was too bad, but she did say that you never know what is going to happen in the future and if God wanted, then I would return. We then went by John and Sally's store to say goodbye. While we were sitting with Sally, she mentioned that she needed to go to John's mother's home for a moment and invited us along. As did when
we met her mother, this signified a deepening of the relationship between my supervisor and Sally.

I discarded my water bottle; however, I was told that wasn't necessary as I was able to board
with a water bottle.

However, standards shift within the same airports when returning to south Ontario. At the
Thunder Bay airport, upon returning to Toronto we boarded on the upper level of the airport. I was asked for identification to travel back to Toronto. No identification required when flying up

to northern Ontario however, only when flying back to south Ontario. Also, all bags were searched and all liquids had to be contained properly. It appears this double standard in airport
security signifies security in south Ontario is taken much more seriously than in northern
Ontario. Lack of security translates to an unspoken message delivered to First Nations

counterparts receive in south Ontario. The Advocate also discussed the concerns of services being delivered up north but not available to those who require them. For example, bus services
are provided to take children to and from school. However, when a bus driver refuses to accept the child on the bus due to behavioural reasons, the child is left with no alternative way to get to
school. The end result is the child does not go to school.

communities living in the north. On the third trip up to northern Ontario, we met a Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth who specializes in working with northern Ontario First Nations youth. In a personal communication, the Advocate, whose focus in on quality of care in group homes, highlighted the emerging issues in northern Ontario group homes. A current trend in northern Ontario group homes is to rely on police to deal with in-house youth behavioural issues. In south Ontario, these same issues would be dealt with in-house by qualified staff trained to work in such situations.
However, First Nations youth with the same issues are being handed over to the police in northern Ontario. The homes seem to be staffed with unqualified workers who have not been trained to implement appropriate strategies for guiding youth and managing the issues faced in group homes. As a result, the police are receiving large amounts of calls to deal with issues that

Within the fly-in First Nations reserve, a childcare centre has been built with a new playground and equipment. The centre is not operating, however, because they cannot find a
qualified person to run it. In a personal communication with a teacher from the community

school, she mentioned there is an abundance of equipment and materials for teaching children
with special needs, but the school has never used them because they cannot find a teacher who is qualified. These services are available but cannot be provided. It is critical to recognize the
significant difference between available and accessible services. Another area of division between south and northern Ontario is the cost of food. The cost of food is substantially higher in northern Ontario. Please see Table 1.

should be dealt with in-house, increasing the criminalization of First Nations youth. The Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth discussed the discrepancy in access to services between north and south Ontario. Service providers have long waiting lists in the north; they have mandates to follow further complicated by levels of funding. Often there are
discrepancies between federal, ministry, and treaty stipulations, which delay the funding of services to children and youth in meaningful ways. As a result of this bureaucracy, a large

It appears that the quality of life of First Nations in the north has not changed since 1892. A First Nations community on a fly-in reserve pay on average three to four times higher costs for the same food the "general" customers in south Ontario would pay. Food available in the northern store, on reserves, is unaffordable to the community members whose main source of income is social assistance. Fresh food, in particular, may not be

Bureaucratic Disentitlement in a northern Ontario First Nations Community

Through personal communication, a community member named Peter described an experience he had in grade five. The teacher, who was white and in charge of a group of
Aboriginal children, passed out an envelope with pieces of paper inside with career options for

priced at cheaper rates and more widely available. While in the store, I noticed a grandmother with her grandson shopping for groceries. The

He laughed as he remembered how absurd he thought this was in grade five to have Prime Minister as a career option. From that early age, Peter believed it would be an impossibility to have an Aboriginal Prime Minister of Canada, even if he wanted to be. Peter addressed the disconnect

young boy, around eight or nine years old, was happily talking with his grandmother and putting food in the cart. I felt the despair as the grandmother examined the food products the boy put in the cart, checked its price, and put it back repeatedly.
In my personal reflection that evening, I felt an uneasy sense of privilege. I tried to

between the teacher's reality and that of the Aboriginal children. This showed me that from a young age, Peter did not feel he had political opportunity to

be Prime Minister in that he would not be allowed to. Peter had received verbal and non-verbal
messages from his environment that he was limited in his life choices. At a young age, the
environment shapes self-esteem in positive or negative ways. At this young age, this boy

true. Peter seemed to be more realistic than his teacher at the time.
In discussing the hierarchy of power and decision-making in Canada, Peter explained, Chiefs are to be parallel with the Prime Minister of the country. However, Peter explained,

dominate policies and governance and leave no room for First Nations perspectives and
redistribution of power.

In a separate personal communication with John, he explained the plans he once had to implement an agriculture project. John had intentions and plans to build a greenhouse in order to advance the community by providing opportunity for employment, to have reasonably priced
food, and to acquire skills in planting and harvesting. John had written a proposal to the federal
government requesting funding and had sought out a variety of flinders to support the project.
However, the project came to a halt when someone within the bureaucratic system lost his proposal. John explained that it was challenging to write the proposal with all the other priorities he had. This bureaucrat was not able to locate a copy of the proposal and John's feeling of discouragement stopped the process. As a result, the plans to introduce agriculture in the
community were ended.

Chiefs cannot charge tax, cannot set laws, and Aboriginal peoples are not represented in
Parliament. Peter explained that the First Nations hierarchy of governance is different. The Chief

becomes the spokesperson for the common person. The common person is top of the hierarchy,
who speaks to the elders, the elders speak to the Chief, and the Chief consults with the councillors. In a separate personal communication with a different community member named John, he too explained that the Chiefs' role is to serve the common people. He explained how the laws

resulting from the Indian Act immobilize the advancement of reserve First Nations communities.
Chiefs may remain in power for a limit of two years while the Prime Minister is in power for four years. Peter explained how it is virtually impossible to initiate change advancement for a community within two years. By the time the Chief has his priorities in place, decides the

direction to take the community, and writes necessary proposals, his term is up. This makes it hard to follow-through on community advancement, which results in progress being stunted. Peter felt that this is a deliberate policy, created in the Indian Act, to keep First Nations communities from moving forward. This personal communication is a clear example of a power imbalance between the federal government and Chief and Band Council. Not only are the world

The observations I made were both structured and unstructured (Mulhall, 2003).
Structured observation focused on documenting the process of the forming of a research team within the community. I was conscious to note the process involved in order to have sufficient data to evaluate its process in comparison to Tuckman's stages of group formation (1965).

Observations were also unstructured. In unstructured observations, I was careful to record

manner. We were taken to sacred land, introduced to family members, and were welcomed and

cared for. A research team emerged out of relationships. The members of the community team
made efforts to establish trust with us as a prerequisite to forming a team. The perspective-taking qualities of PER provided for this opportunity and challenged the distant role of researcher that I
was accustomed to. There is a humanizing focus in PER. The goal of PER is for social transformation (King, 1998). Social transformation cannot happen with a distant, objective, and impersonal approach. On the contrary, the research must practice perspective taking with the
members and attune to their concerns.

trying to observe the process of implementing PER but it wasn't happening. It was not until three months after my last visit up north that I realized I was trained to approach research in a
traditional, detached, objective manner that is reflective of mainstream knowledge. PER

challenged this approach for me. Implementing PER did not follow the stages as compact as Tuckman's (1965) model outlines. The western approach is to form a team, to begin meetings, and to start working toward a common goal, as Tuckman's (1965) model depicts action. There appears to be limitations to applying Tuckman's group development model within
a First Nations community. Tuckman (1965) outlines a model that reflects a narrow western perspective of group development. The model is void of cultural perspective and needs to be used with caution when implementing PER in a First Nations community. PER proved to be

Tuckman's (1965) stages of group development describe individuals in a boxed-in
manner as he defines the characteristics of each stage. Tuckman states individuals in the forming stage are focused on themselves and are on their best behaviour (King, 1998). The community members who joined the team took action to establish a sense of trust with us as we defined
together that we were working toward a common goal.

Tuckman reflects an individualistic perspective while we discover a collectivist perspective in the north. Tuckman's model of group development would need to be expanded to include a pre-forming stage when implemented within a First Nations community. The pre forming stage should emphasis the need to establish genuine care and concern for the community beyond the scope of the research study. It would also be necessary to accept community advances to build trust with the researcher. In doing so, the researcher respects the community's process and together they establish a common ground. The pre-forming stage would have to be open to the diversity expressed among First Nations communities. However, we can be sure the western traditional, objective, and distant approach to research has caused damage in First Nations communities while perspective taking becomes a fundamental value of PER.

impossible without the formation of relationships between the researcher and the community. It was out of relationships that the team came together. Tuckman (1965) states that all teams must move through the same stages in order to produce results. Within the "forming" stage, the team
is required to form and then meet to hold a discussion on the topic. From my experience in

northern Ontario, it is evident that this did not happen. Before a team emerged, relationships needed to be established. It was out of our relationships that community members formed a team.
It is a western approach to form a team and plan to have a productive meeting. My

observations demonstrate that this First Nations community processed in a very different

The Community as a Team

Cultural Continuity

From the beginning, the key elements proved to be trust and friendship. Members did not need to be convinced to care for their children's well-being, nor did they need encouragement to discuss grave concern for their youth; they needed to be convinced that an academic institution could be trusted. A community of people who are familiar with the comings and goings of researchers who are only interested in their own personal advancement needed to feel valued beyond the scope of the researchers' desire to advance themselves. Reaching out in friendship
has proven to be the most significant aspect of this project.

There are northern First Nation communities that have a number of protective factors in place that appear to enhance better outcome for youth. Chandler and Lalonde (2004), Professors of in the Department of Psychology, at the University of British Columbia, have done extensive research in the identification of cultural protective factors toward incidences of youth suicide. Over a fourteen-year study, Chandler and Lalonde have found First Nations communities to vary

in suicide rates. Eight cultural protective factors have been attributed to rate of suicide. The eight
protective factors are: 1) Ability to regain land claims; 2) Re-establishment of self-government; 3) Control over education; 4) Control over health care; 5) Control over fire and policing services;
6) Implementation of cultural events and practices; 7) Provision of child and family services; and 8) Presence of women in government (Chandler & Lalonde, 2004).

I observed a community with much strength. I observed teachers who pride themselves in
their work despite the lack of outside support, children who work hard at school despite the lack

of resources, community members who became part of the research team out of genuine care and concern for their children, parents who valued their child's education, and a community that welcomed and cared for us despite historical abuses of the past. I observed value for family,
respect for tradition, and pride in themselves as a community.

The eight factors are to ensure cultural continuity (Morris, 2007). Cultural continuity is
the protective factor against the high rate of First Nations youth suicide. Communities that

demonstrate none of the protective factors have ten times the national rate of youth suicide while communities who demonstrate all eight protective factors have healthier communities with a zero
youth suicide rate (Chandler & Lalonde, 2004). As the amount of factors present in a First

control their own lives. PER provides the opportunity to design policy that is locally specific to
the diversity of First Nations communities. In accessing more decision-making power, communities can be less affected by a bureaucratic system that seems to slow progress in the
north.

First Nations communities are strengthened as they take control over decisions being made that directly affect them. As young people struggle with generations of cultural loss, their

self-esteem is strengthened as they acquire a self-concept within environments that are self-

opportunity to take control and action for themselves, which is made possible with PER.

confidence and self-esteem can be increased as governments listen and take the perspective of
First Nations communities. Members can feel valued and respected if given the freedom to express themselves openly. Motivation could then increase as communities become active in policy formation. I believe the government is in a position to increase community self-esteem by
embracing PER.

In a democratic society, all members are assumed equal access to power. Within this context, it is assumed social justice is in play. However, the white dominant culture in power assumes a sense of superiority as it creates systems to perpetuate its ideological values and
assumptions. In ignoring First Nations world perspectives, the dominant culture devalues the significance of First Nations culture, language, spirituality, and ways of being. As the dominant culture considers their own ways of being as superior, they construct a political system that oppresses First Nations. Considering oneself as superior is the basis of racism. Those who hold the power often lack perspective taking. Lack of perspective taking opens the pathway to racism

Federal and provincial governments should be obligated to support implementation of
PER without providing direction for the research. While being supportive, governments must
remain independent as government and community perspectives may differ. Government officials should be trained in the importance of PER with an understanding of how to begin its implementation and the benefits to be gained through community development. Increasing public awareness will also strengthen the support required for successful implementation of PER. First Nations communities need a movement of caring individuals who understand how to implement PER and care for justice without dominating the direction of the research. Universities can also support PER by ensuring it as part of a graduate curriculum. Members of the community need to
build a trusting relationship in order to see researchers as people that can connect them to outside resources in order to achieve the goals they set out to accomplish.

and stereotyping since only the perspective of the self is valued. In actual fact, the rules and regulations that govern the Canadian democratic system are embedded in racism in ways that are
oblivious to the culture in power until they learn to identify power imbalance.

PER has the capacity to rebuild a sense of hope within First Nations communities
Future Direction

(Cousins & Whitmore, 1998). When implementing PER within First Nations communities, it is essential to add a pre-forming stage. This pre-forming stage needs to be funded by the federal government as an essential component of implementing PER, as establishing trust within an oppressed community may take time. The pre-forming stage provides time for the community to build a sense of trust and friendship with the researcher. It is necessary to acknowledge that the

Governments need to embrace PER. The ability to construct new knowledge through PER can be the gateway to mending relationships between governments and First Nations people. Empowerment is the core value of PER. If governments shift the power to First Nations
