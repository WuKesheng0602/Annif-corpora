Abstract
HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX MODELS FOR THE WOOD FROG (RANA SYLVATICA) AND BOREAL CHORUS FROG (PSEVDACRJS TRISERIATA MACVLATA) IN THE FOOTHILLS PARK.LAND NATURAL SUB--REGION AND BOW RIVER SUB-BASIN, ALBERTA Master of Applied Science, 2008 Zachary Edward Otke Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario

Habitat suitability index (HSI) models were developed for the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and for the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata maculata) in the Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region and Bow River Sub-basin in west-central Alberta. The

models are based on key habitat variables that had significant relationships with the
..

population estimates detennined from night calling surveys.

The models were first

derived from literature that was related to ·wood frog and boreal chorus frog habitat and then tested in the field. Using chi-square analysis with a significance level of 0.01, fish presence, water movement, and dominant vegetation were discovered to be key habitat variables for both species. The key habitat variables for each species were integrated into HSI models. The HSI models can bt} used to determine the baseline and future quality of habitat for each species.

Chapter 1: Introduction

In many parts of the world, populations of amphibians are declining. More than 5, 700 an1phibian species have been discovered throughout the world, and scientists claim that n1any more amphibian species have yet to be discovered (Young et al. 2004: 5). Out of the 5,700 amphibian species, approxitnately one third are severely threatened (facing a high risk of extinction in the wild) or extinct (Beebee and Griffiths, 2005; Young et al. 2004: 9). Thirteen amphibian species have been classified as extinct ·since the 1980s (Young et al. 2004: 5). The decline of mnphibians is not limited to small geographic areas, but large areas all over the world: Australia, Africa, Asia, North An1erica, and South An1erica; tnost of the amphibians that have been identified as threatened are found in North and South America (Young et al. 2004: 5). Historically, conservation efforts did not focus specifically on the status of amphibians. When conservationists were first looking at the status of organisms,

amphibians were put into a general animal category; however, this was a problem because amphibians have unique physiological characteristics compared to other animals, such as having penneable, vascular skin used to obtain oxygen (Young et al. 2004: 7). Amphibians are now being examined at as a separate category (Hazell et al. 2001). When looking at amphibians as a separate entity for conservation purposes, population data on many an1phibian species .are lacking con1pared to long-term monitoring studies of other organisms (Panis, 2001). While trying to determine the global inventory of amphibian species and .their population status, it has been discovered that amphibians are disappearing at a faster rate than other species (Young et al. 2004: 5); they have been found to be declining faster than birds or n1mnmals (Cushman, 2006). The World

Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List lists animals that have been classified as critically endangered or vulnerable (Standards and Petitions ·Working Group, 2006). In the most recent updated IUCN Red List (2004), approximately one third of the species are amphibians (Cushtnan, 2006). In North and South America, 1Oo/o of the species found in the IUCN Red List are birds, 16% are mammals, and 39% are amphibians (Young et al. 2004: 24). Scientists are now trying to determine why atnphibians are disappearing so fast, how to conserve historical populations, and how to encourage and sustain new populations (Young et al. 2004: 7) .

.1 :1 Causes for Amphibian Decline
The decline of amphibians can negatively impact the envirorunent. Negative impacts include a decline in biodiversity and interruptions in food webs (Young et al. 2004: 7). Amphibians are also in1portant in the environtnent because they are a

functional link between aquatic and tenestrial environments (Puchniak, 2002). Researchers have suggested that amphibians can be looked at as a biological indicator, where the status of amphibians indicates the status of the overall environment. A decline in amphibians can be used as an early warning sign to indicate that the overall ecological status of an envirornnent is detetiorating (Young et al. 2004: 7; \:Vilhm, 1974). In order to detennine how amphibians relate to a clean environment and to detennine how to slow down the rate of extinction, causes of amphibian decline need to be detern1ined; however, no dear causes have been discovered (Storfer, 2003). Many possible causes for amphibian declines have been identified. Habitat destruction has been suggested as the primary cause, as researchers are finding that amphibian populations are decreasing in relation to habitat destruction (Gardner et al.

2

2007). One of the plimary sources ofhabitat destruction is urbanization. In Canada, over

80o/o of wetlands near urban centres have been lost to agriculture or urbanization
(Govem1nent of Canada, 1991: 3). Since European settlement in Canada, there has been a 65% wetland loss in southern Ontario, 71% in the Prairies, and 80% in the Fraser River Delta, British Columbia (Wiken et al. 2003: 11). These losses are generally correlated with the major urban centres in Canada (Wiken et aL 2003: 11 ). In the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada, more than 40o/o of wetland has been lost, but more than 70o/o of wetland has been lost in urban · areas (Puchniak, 2002). Urbanization is also a major source of habitat loss in the United States. Between 1986 and 1997, 30% of wetland loss was caused by urban developtnent~ 26o/o of wetland loss was caused by agriculture, 23% of wetland loss was caused by silviculture, and 21 o/o of wetland loss was caused by rural developn1ent (Dahl, 2000: 11 ). As urban areas are expanding, habitat that can support amphibian populations is being reduced and urban .barriers between · water bodies that prevent amphibians from migrating to support a greater amphibian community are 1ncreas1ng. Even though habitat destruction is considered to be the pnmary cause of amphibian decline, it is very ditncult to 1neasure. It is also difficult to itnply that habitat destruction directly causes declines in amphibian populations. Woodford and Meyer

.

.

(2003) tried to directly relate habitat destruction to an1phibian decline. They used linear regression to quantify the decline in green frog (Rana clamitans melanota) abundance against the increase in lakeshore development in northern Wisconsin (United States). They tound a negative linear relationship between green frog abundance and lakeshore development; however, there still is the possibility that lakeshore develop1nent was not

3

the only cause for the decline in green frog abundance because other environmental variables, which could have interfered with the results, may not have been controlled during their study. Another potential cause of amphibian decline is exposure to toxins. Agricultural activities use nutrients, pesticides, and other chemicals that can be toxic to amphibians. Bishop et al. (1999) deten11ined that organophosphates used as pesticides for agricultural activities can create deformities in tadpoles. The study also found that there is a lower degree of egg hatching success and a higher amount of tadpole deformities in wetlands with high nutrient loads, particularly ammonium nitrate. Northern leopard fi:og (Rana sylvatica) embryos are sensitive to ammonium nitrate fertilizer levels above 0.27 mg/L; levels above the 0.27 mg/L can result in larvae developmental abnormalities (Bishop et al. 1999). Bishop et al. (1 999) found amn1onium nitrate levels above 0.27 mg/L in one of their agricultural zones. Conservation efforts need to consider the protection of wetlands that are near agricultural land. Research on the etTects of toxic chemicals on amphibians needs to be conducted and methods to prevent toxic chemical consumption need to be developed (Young et al 2004: 35). Disease is a potential cause for global amphibian decline. The disease primarily responsible for the decline is chytridiomycosis (Hmner et al. 2002). Chytridiomycosis, found responsible for many population crashes, is caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This species is a fungus and part of the chytrid family. The fungus has been found to be responsible for crashes of amphibian populations in areas that have been p1i1narily undisturbed. A major probletn with this fungus is that it is very widespread, as
it bas been detected in many parts of world including Australia, Costa Rica, and North

4

Atnerica (Young et al. 2004: 33, 35). While disease may not be the prilnary cause of amphibian decline, it has been found that con1bined with other causes, such as predators and pesticides, a synergistic effect can be developed and generate an even faster rate of amphibian decline (Thiemann and W assersug, 2000). Invasive species can also be a potential cause tor amphibian decline. Amphibian populations can decline from the effects of invasive species if the an1phibians' habitat is altered (Thiemann and Wassersug, 2000). Fish stocking is a form of species invasion. Introducing predatory fish into an area that historically did not have predatory fish can be detrimental to amphibian species that inhabit the area. In Yosemite National Park

(United States), fishennen stocked historically fishless lakes with various species of trout for the purpose of recreational fishing. Afterwards, the n1ountain yellow-legged frog

(Ran a muscosa) populations declined; the probability of finding a 111ountain yellowlegged frog was three titnes greater in a fishless water body than a fish-containing water body (Young et al. 2004: 36; Knapp and Matthevvs, 2000). Some other domestic species in North America have been discovered to have a negative impact on amphibian populations. Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) can out-compete leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) as the bullfrog has expanded its historical range, and purple loosestrife (Lythrum

salicaria) has been found to be responsible for drying up wetlands and causing a
reduction in amphibian habitat (Young et aL 2004: 38).
It has also been suggested that climate change is a major cause for the global

amphibian decline (Young et aL 2004: 37).

Global watming causes an increase in Global warming can

average atn1ospheric temperature (Beebee and Griffiths, 2005).

reduce or shift the time pe1iod for amphibians to breed and juveniles to grow by reducing

5

the hydroperiod of many amphibians' aquatic habitat Global warming also can affect the ranges of tnany organisms causing an unwanted shift in ecosystem characteristics. Although global wmming has been suggested as a potential cause for global amphibian decline, it is very difficult to support, since there is a lack of
long~tenn

data for

amphibian populations, even though there 1night be adequate long-term dimate data (Young et al. 2004: 37). The increase of UV -B radiation, caused by ozone depletion and greenhouse gases, has also been suggested as a cause for the global mnphibian dedine (Beebee and Griffiths, 2005). Amphibians have petmeable skin and therefore may be more sensitive to UV-B radiation (Young et al. 2004: 7). Further research is needed to determine ifUVB radiation is a significant cause of global mnphibian decline, since it has been discovered that it does not negatively affect aU mnphibians (Beebee and Griffiths, 2005). Hakkinen et al. (2001) found that common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles exposed to UV-B treatments had a lower survival than tadpoles exposed to the control treatlnents. For the common frog (Rana ternporaria) and the moor frog (Rana arvalis), there was no significant difference in tadpole survival between the UV-B and the control treatments.
1:2 Amphibians and Metapopulations

Many researchers suggest that amphibian population dynan1ics follo\\r a metapopulation theory system (Marsh and Trenllmn, 2001). Amphibians are believed to live in subpopulations. Each water body supports an amphibian subpopulation, and the group of neighbouring subpopulations n1akes a larger metapopulation. As an1phibians are capable of migrating from one water body to another, a group of water bodies that are dose enough to allow amphibians to migrate can suppoti a metapopulation. The

6

metapopulation allows genetic flow between sub-populations and can support the genera] amphibian community if one subpopulation crashes (Marsh and Trenham, 2001 ). If the amphibian species of interest is organized into a metapopulation, conservation efforts need to take the metapopulation concept into consideration. Urban development and other forms of habitat destruction can elilninate water bodies that are part of a tnetapopulation or increase the distance between water bodies. If the distance between the \Vater bodies is increased, then the n1etapopulation may become fragn1ented. Amphibians may not be able to migrate fi·otn a water body that can no longer support the population because the n1igratory distance is too far. The population could crash

resulting in a significant decline in the tnetapopulation. Conservation efforts need to be made in order to keep water bodies in a cluster. If wetlands are to be constructed, a cluster of heterogeneous wetlands need to be developed. Regulations also need to

consider the conservation of smaller wetlands, not just large permanent wetlands. Smaller wetlands tnay also support subpopulations that are part of a metapopulation (Gibbs, 2000). Other studies have found that not all mnphibians work on a metapopulation level. Sotne studies have .tested amphibian populations for genetic differences and have found that there is very little difference between the subpopulations. A lack of gene flow and migrating amphibians between the populations would tnean that the populations are not grouped into a n1etapopulation (Squire and Newman, 2002). Other studies have tried to determine the exact mechanisms that support a metapopulation systen1 and to find ways of n1easuring how strongly the tnetapopulation concept applies to a particular an1phibian, since the mechanisms behind the metapopulation theory are still not fully understood

7

(Joly et at 2003; Casagrandi and Gatto, 2002; GyUenburg and Hanski, 1997).

For

conservation purposes, managen1ent plans should be dit1erent for amphibians that do not work on a metapopulation system cotnpared to amphibians that work on the tnetapopulation level. If certain amphibians are not organized into a metapopulation, then it may be sufficient to protect general areas of wetlands that support amphibian populations, rather than trying to focus on the protection of the connectivity between wetlands (Squire and Newman, 2002).
1:3 Amphibian Habitat

Wetlands, semi-aquatic ecosystems, act as filters of nutrients and provide habitat for many flora and fauna. Many of these flora and fauna depend on these semi-aquatic environments. Under the Canadian Wetland Classification System, the official definition of a wetland is ""land that is saturated \Vith water long enough to promote wetland or aquatic processes as indicated by poorly drained soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and various kinds of biological activity which are adapted to a wet environment" (National Wetlands Working Group, 1997: 1). There are many types of wetland around the world. In South America, hnportant types of wetland are wet meadows and peatland (Brinson and Malvarez, 2002). In southern Australia and New Zealand, wetland includes upland swamps, coastal lagoons, and mound springs (Brinson and Malvarez, 2002). In Canada, wetland types include marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens (National Wetlands Working Group, 1997: 9). Wetland types are influenced by their sources of water, the length of their hydroperiod, soil type, and vegetation (National Wetlands Working Group, 1997: 3). Wetland not only plays an important part in supporting wildlife and vegetation, but also

8

attracts human attention, as wetland is a source of water and can have aesthetic value (Kupchella and Hyland, 1993: 414-415). Most industrialized countties have identified their loss of wetland and are tnaking efforts to keep it sustainable. Wetland conservation is more difficult for less

industrialized countries, which are expetiencing wetland declining at a faster rate (Btinson and Malvarez, 2002). Most countties, highly industrialized and less

industrialized, do not have accurate inventories of their wetland to help thetn determine its status and the biodiversity within it (Brinson and 1\/lalvarez, 2002). Instead of developing conservation plans for an entire ecosystem, it n1ay be more efficient to focus on a particular wetland species, such as amphibians, which are a semiaquatic species. Researchers have suggested an1phibians may be biological indicators that reflect the quality of wetland (Young et al. 2004: 7). Biological indicators are selected species that have sensitive responses on an organism, population, or cotnmunity level to physical, biological, or physical changes in the environment, such as habitat change, contamination, changes in food availability, or changes in predator-prey relationships (Adams, 2002: 2;,.4). Organisms that have a narrow ecological tolerance or are very sensitive to changes in the environment can be used as early warnings signs for negative changes in the environn1ent (Jackson, 1974: 27). Organisms that are thought to be biological indicators can be tested by comparing present populations with historical populations. Over a certain time frame, change in a particular ecosystem will most likely occur. A decrease in the population of the selected organism during the time frame wiH show that the organism has a nano\v ecological tolerance and could be used as a biological indicator (Stuckey, 1974: 27-28). An1phibians have permeable skin and can

9

accumulate contaminants quicker than other organisn1s and can be atTected quicker by environmental change (Young et aL 2004: 7); therefore, a healthy population of mnphibians present in a selected wetland may indicate that the wetland is high-quality (Brodman et aL 2006). By focusing on conserving amphibians, the indirect preservation of wetlands may result. Amphibians rely on both the aquatic and tenestrial component of wetland ecosystem (Baldwin et al. 2006). The terrestrial component of wetland, or any other water body, acts as a physical and chemical filter that aids in the protection of the aquatic componenL Many amphibians rely on the tetTestrial component during the year. In the spring, many amphibians use the aquatic habitat tor breeding and ovipositing (Semlitsch and Bodie, 2003). During the rest of the year, many mnphibians use the terrestrial

cotnponent for foraging and ovetwintering. Amphibians also need a terrestrial corridor between their terrestrial and aquatic habitats to aid in successful migration (Semlitsch and Bodie, 2003). There has been great progress in protecting the aquatic component of wetland; however, the ten·estrial component is often overlooked. Research on the terrestrial

component of wetland and its ecological significance tor amphibians is poorly understood (Gibbons, 2003). Many regulations are pritnarily focused on the aquatic component of wetland, such as the wetland delineation process in the United States (Hermann et aL 2005; Maisonneuve and Rioux, 2001 ). In Quebec, one regulation, the Protection Policy for Lakeshores, Riverbanks, Littoral Zone, and Floodplains, states that a riparian buffer strip needs to be established between the agricultural landscape and the bordering water body; however, it only has to be three metres wide (Maisonneuve and Rioux, 2001 ).

10

Even though part of the terrestrial environment is protected, this regulation is intended to meet the purpose of protecting the water quality by preventing sediment and nutrient runoff, even though it seen1s to be insufficient, since studies have discovered that a 6-m buffer is a sufficient buffer width (Borin et al. 2005; Borin and Bigon, 2002), and the United States Forest Service recommends a three-zone buffer with a total width of 28.5 m to suft1dently protect the water from sedimentation and nutrient run-off (Corell, 2005). There are fewer regulations to protect the tetTestrial component of wetlands. Lee et al. (2004) reviewed the guidelines to retain treed riparian buffers after timber harvest between jurisdictions in Canada and the United States. Only 48% of the jurisdictions stated the protection of both aquatic and tetTestrial habitats and· aquatic and tenestrial biota in their guidelines; however, there vvas no statistical difference in the buffer widths between the jurisdictions who stated the protection of the aquatic and terrestrial component in·their guidelines and the jurisdictions ·who stated the protection of only the aquatic component in their guidelines. Some organisms, such as forest-dwelling birds and moose, require wider buffer widths than the n1ean buffer vvidths in the Canadian jurisdictions (Darveau et at 1995; Brusnyk and Gilbert, 1983). The mean buffer widths in the study conducted by Lee et al. (2004) were 54.6 m for large lakes, 47.1 metres for small hikes, 43.8tn for large permanent streams, 29.6 m for small permanent streams, and 13.8 m for intermittent streams. Forest-dwelling birds require a 60-m buffer and moose require a 60-m buffer for a sufficient atnount of habitat area (Darveu et at 1995; Brusnyk and Gilbert, 1983).
It has been discovered that amphibians require a wider buffer than the guidelines

set out by tnany Canadian and American jurisdictions (Let et al. 2004). Semlitsch and

11

Bodie (2003) have detennined that an adequate ten·estrial buffer for majority of amphibians that inhabit wetlands should range frotn 142 m to 289
111.

Other researchers

have determined adequate buffer widths for particular species. Bulger et aL (2003) have detennined that an adequate buffer width for the California red-legged frog (Rana aurora draytonii) is to be at least 100 metres. Buffers also need to reflect the natural habitat for the species of interest. In forest tnanagement, undeveloped or natural areas bordering water bodies are left untouched in order to prevent an increase in sedimentation, an increase in the temperature of the water body, and to help protect wildlife that require a riparian area {Olson et al. 2007; Macdonald et al. 2006). Once a buffer is hnplemented, the natural quality of the buffer needs to be retained (Dupuis and Steventon, 1999). A buffer is useless if there is no suitable protection to retain the buffer's ecological integrity. The quality of the riparian buffer strip that needs to be protected from agricultural developtnents in Quebec, implemented under the Protection Policy for Lakeshores, Riverbanks, Littoral Zones, and
Floodplains~

is usually deteriorated because farmers have been found to spray pesticides

and bum the area to prevent the growth of cover vegetation for pests. The buffers need to have tninitnum disturbance (Maisotmeuve and Rioux, 2001 ). If it is not possible to retain an undeveloped, natural buffer, a buffer can be created that reflects the habitat characteristics of the species of interest. This may be difficult, as the terrestrial habitat characteristics for many amphibian species may be unknown (Rodriguez-Prieto and Femandez-Juricic, 2005; Bulger et al. 2003). ln order for a wetland to have optimum biodiversity, both the aquatic and terrestrial components of the wetland need to be adequately protected (Semlitsch and

12

Bodie, 2003). amphibians.

It may be difficult to separate the niche of each environment for
W et1ands are a transition zone bet\veen the aquatic and terrestrial

environment. Because an1phibians rely on a habitat where two environn1ents overlap, there is a great potential for a number of environmental variables, that have not been accounted for, to interfere with the observations of a study, and it may be very difficult to look at habitat variables independently. H tnay be diHicult to isolate one variable and show that it directly impacts an amphibian population (Guerry and Hunter Jr., 2002); ho\vever, mesocosms could be used to address this problem (Caquet et aL 1996).
1:4 Amphibian Conservation

Sotne conservation methods have been developed in order to protect and sustain amphibian populations. One amphibian conservation method is wetland restoration.

Damaged wetland is restored to a better state in order to improve the water quality and biodiversity (Zedler, 2000). ln California (United States), it was discovered that

introducing non-native trout had a negative impact on the mountain yellow-legged frog (Knapp and Matthews, 2000). Knapp et aL (2007) looked at mountain yellow-legged recovery after fish were removed from water bodies that were stocked with trout. Knapp et aL (2007) discovered that tnountain yellow-legged frog population densities significantly increased after fish were removed fi·om the san1ple water bodies. Habitat creation is also used to generate and sustain amphibian populations. In the Greater Toronto Area (Ontario), a.tnphibian tunnels have been constructed to join wetland areas that have been separated by the Bayview-Avenue roadway. lt has been sotne\vhat successful, since they have found the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and the spring peeper (Pseudacris
cruc~fer)

using the

13

tunnels, but they did not find their target spectes, the tiger salamander (Ambystorna
tigrinum ), present in the tunnels. More research to make the tunnels suitable habitat for

the tiger salamander has been suggested (Gartshore et al. 2006). Translocations of amphibians to a newly constructed or historical habitat have proved successful in the vievv of sotne researchers (Kendell, 2002b: 16; Seigel and Dodd Jr., 2002; Weyrauch and An1on, 2002). South of Lethbridge, Alberta, efforts have been made to generate new populations of the threatened northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens). Egg masses were gathered fi-on1 known populations and transported to ne\v sites. The egg masses were put into floating enclosures for protection from predators. Once the egg tnasses hatched and the tadpoles \Vere mobile, they were released into suitable habitat. This seems to be a success since northern leopard frogs have been found the following spring seasons confirming that they survived the overwintering. Breeding behaviour has also been observed at the translocation sites (Ron1anchuk and Quinlan, 2006: 1-2, 14-15). Successful translocations of the northern leopard fi·og has also been done in Crimson Lake .Provincial Park, near Rocky Mountain House, Alberta and the Raven Brood Trout Station, near Caroline, Albet1a (Kendell, 2002a: 3, 19). Researchers are also trying to determine how the public can cooperate and help protect amphibians. Marty et al. (2005) found that cattle grazing, if tnanaged properly, can support sufficient amphibian populations, as well as invertebrate and native plant contmunities. Hazen et at (2001) examined how farmer's datns affected mnphibian populations. The study examined the status of an1phibian populations, and whether the dams caused a negative or positive impact; it focused on how farmers can help keep the populations sustainable. Hazell et al. (200 1) discovered that there was a positive

14

relationship between native vegetation in the surrounding landscape and frog species richness. The researchers suggested that since the farm dams are on private land, it is necessary to try to make the dams serve two functions: act as a \Vater system for agriculture and act as habitat for frogs occurring on the property. It is important to find ways for landowners to n1aintain their business and land activities while keeping amphibian populations present on their land and neighbouring lands sustainable. In order for these amphibian conservation methods to be successful, habitat requiretnents must be understood. It has been suggested that many constructed wetlands do not reflect the habitat needs of the an1phibian species have been selected for conservation. Many managers have sitnply dug a large hole with steep slopes and filled it with water to tnake a wetland (Porej and Hetherington, 2005). Euliss and Mushet (2004) detennined that the excavation of wetland, in the Little Missouri National Grassland in the (United States), lengthened the hydroperiod of the wetland. They discovered a drop in amphibian populations and an increase in predator species in the wetland that became permanent. The wetland that was once seasonal wetland allowed amphibians to thrive because a seasonal hydroperiod prevented the wetland from being permanent habitat for predators. There is a problem with the general assumption that any water body is better than no water body at alL A water body that is not designed specifically to support an

amphibian population 1nay not support a high level of biodiversity. Wetland with steep slopes can support a permanent hydroperiod, can support predatory fish, and therefore may not support a large amphibian population. Restored and constructed wetland that is

15

designed to support amphibian populations tnust reflect the habitat characteristics of the amphibian species of interest (Porej and Hetherington, 2005).
It may be necessary to use mesocosms to determine the habitat requirements of a

selected amphibian species (Marsh et al. 1999).

Mesocosms are created tnan-made

systems that are designed to sin1ulate certain habitat conditions and prevent other environmental variables frotn interfering with the results of a study (Caquet et al. 1996). Roe et al. (2006) took cattle tanks, placed sediment and pond water from their sample area in the tanks, and then placed mole salmnanders (Ambystonza talpoideum) fro1n their sample area into the tanks. A specific treatment was added to each tank to test how salamanders responded to coal-combustion waste. The tanks had mesh covers to prevent predator intrusion and the water levels ·were lowered to simulate the drying of temporary ponds. By using these tanks, predator intrusion, water levels, and soil dynamics were all accounted for, so they could isolate coal-combustion waste as a variable and study its direct itnpact on green frog population dynamics. Roe et al. (2006) discovered that coalcotnbustion waste has a negative impact on salamander larvae; the number of mole salamander larvae that reached metamorphosis was reduced by 57-77%, compared to the reference tanks. When trying to conserve amphibian populations, scientists have found that it is inefficient to develop a general conservation strategy. different habitat charactetistics. Each mnphibian species has

A general conservation strategy may overlook the

prin1ary needs of one amphibian species, even though the strategy may help the majority of amphibian species in the area of interest. Each conservation strategy tnust be speciesspecific, in order to optimize the success of each amphibian species of interest. Guerry

16

and Hunter Jr. (2002) have results that support this conservation method. They compared species presence with forest area and discovered that some amphibians have a positive relationship with forest area and some have a negative relationship with forest area. If a general conservation strategy was developed to focus on preserving the forest area, the amphibian species with a negative relationship may struggle to keep its population sustainable. Some researchers are trying to inform managers that the terrestrial component of a wetland needs to be protected. Regulations need to focus on the protection of the aquatic environment as well as the terrestrial environment. In order to determine whether the amount of area of land bordering a wetland is sufficient to protect an1phibians, researchers are determining the migratory distance of their species of interest.

By

looking at the literature that focused on migratory distances of an1phibians, Semlitsch and Bodie (2003) determined the mean minimum core terrestrial habitat and maximutn core terrestrial habitat for frogs and salamanders. For frogs, the mean minimum and

maximun1 terrestrial habitat is 205 m and 368 m from a wetland; for salamanders, the mean minilnum and maxilnum terrestrial habitat is 117 m and 218 m. Each amphibian species has a different migratory distance, since Semlitsch and Bodie (2003) cotnpared the migratory distances of 19 frog species and 13 salamander species; therefore, it tnay be more efficient to develop a terrestrial environment protection plan that is species-specific. Some threatened species tnay not be properly protected if a general terrestrial environtnent protection plan was developed (Semlitsch and Bodie, 2003). Also, the area should be able to suppo11 the majority of migrations that happen within the season. If the

17

area is too small, some amphibians may become susceptible to dangers outside of the buffer zone (Regosin et al. 2005). In order tor researchers and managers to detennine an amphibian species' habitat characteristics with a high level of accuracy and precision, long-tenn 1nonitoring is recommended. Many studies are short-term (studies taken over a few years) and

therefore have a lower level of confidence. Long-term studies (studies taken over many years or decades) can also allow for researchers and tnanagers to determine the status of amphibian populations from historical data or detern1ine the success of restored or constructed wetlands (Wicknick et at 2005). The main problem ·with long-term

monitoring is that it can be expensive to acquire sufficient data for highly accurate results (Cushman, 2006) Long-term monitoring helps to get a clear picture of the past and to be able to detetmine patterns in wildlife behavior, populations, habitat change from both natural and anthropogenic sources, and dimate change. Based on monitoring data, patterns can be determined and the data can be used develop models in order to predict future patterns in amphibian populations. Models can also be used to predict how changes in certain Habitat models can be a useful tool for the

Chapter 2: Background of the Study Area and Species of Study
2:1 Objective of the Study

The objective of this study was to develop habitat suitability index (HSl) n1odels for frogs found in the Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region and the Bow River Subbasin of Alberta during their breeding season. The boreal chorus trog (Pseudacris

trise·riata maculata ), the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens ), and the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) are kno\vn to be present in the selected geographic area (Alberta Conservation

and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, 2003: 6, 9, 20).

These models are

specit!c to Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region and the Bo\v River Sub-basin of Alberta, and they 1nay be used to help conserve mnphibian habitat and wetland for a geographic area that may experience heavy habitat destruction as a result of Calgary~ s expansion (Government of Canada, 2006: 25). In Alberta, very few HSI models have been developed for amphibian conservation 1nanage1nent purposes. So far, HSI models have been developed for the long-toed

salmnander (Ambystonza nzacrodactylum), western toad (Bufo boreas), and northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) in the Oldman River Basin; HSI models have been developed for the great plains toad (Bufo cognatus) and plains spadefoot toad (Spea bombifi·ons) in the Milk River Basin; and a HSI model has been developed for the long-toed salamander in the Foothills Model Forest (Blouin et aL 2004: 136-I 69, Downey et al. 2004: 99-111; Graham et aL 1999: 1-6). The HSI models developed in this study are the first known habitat models to be developed for amphibian species that have been found in the selected geographic area.

19

Through a literature review, habitat variables and their relationship with the population dynamics for a particular frog species that is known to be present within the selected geographic were first determined. Studies that were reviewed included Burton, 2001; Cushman, 2006; Eaton, 2004; Egan and Paton, 2004; Findlay, 2001; Findlay and Bourdages, 2000; Kolozsvary, 2003; Norris, 2006; Patrick et al. 2006; Pearson, 2004; Petranka et al. 2007; Porej et al. 2004; Rubbo and Kiesecker, 2005; Skelly et al. 1999; Stevens et al. 2007; Stevens et al. 2006; Stevens et al 2006; and Vasconcelos and Calhoun, 2006. HSI models that are species-specific and can be used to determine

overall habitat quality were developed using the habitat variables. The habitat variables were then tested in the field within the selected geographic area in order to verifY the models by conducting amphibian population surveys and measuring the habitat variables that are in each model. Field sampling took place during the frogs' breeding season (tnid-April - midMay) within the selected geographic area to detetmine species presence and estimate population. For each species that was found during the field sampling period, the habitat variables that were determined for their HSI model were measured. The northern leopard frog was not found during the field smnpling period, so no model ·was developed. 2:2 Environn1ental Problems in Alberta Alberta has the highest population growth rate in Canada (Government of Alberta 2007: 4). The n1ain area experiencing the growth rate is the Edmonton-Red Deer-Calgary corridor. The oil industry is the primary cause of the high growth rate in Alberta

(Statistics Canada, 2007: 17, 21 ). To keep pace with the high population growth rate, rural areas that are neighbouring urban centres are being converted into expanded urban

20

developtnents of the major urban centres (Government of Alberta, 2007: 4). Many cities are converting land that was primarily used for agriculture and ranching into acreages and urban subdivisions. This horizontal expansion is putting pressure on many natural areas that are near these urban centres (Government of Alberta, 2007: 25). Edmonton, a major urban centre in Alberta, is found in the Aspen Parkland Natural Sub-region (Natural Regions Committee, 2006: 113); however, just north of Edmonton is the Aspen/Boreal interface. Urban expansion, along \vith agriculture, has contributed to heavy

deforestation of the Aspen/Boreal interface (Young et al. 2006). The Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region is one of the three sub-regions that tnake up the Parkland Natural Region (Natural Regions Committee., 2006: 109-11 0). The Parkland Natural Region is one of the six natural regions that n1ake up Alberta. Out of these six natural regions, the Parkland Natural Region is the n1ost densely populated regton. Calgary is part of the Parkland Natural Region and is expanding its urban area toward its neighbouring communities, such as Cochrane, Alberta (Government of Alberta, 2007: 25). Conservation management needs to focus on natural areas that have been or wiU eventually be affected by Calgary's urban expansion. The Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region is still a rural area, but is subject to urbanization and declines in its amphibian populations. Approaches to amphibian conservation, such as HSI models, need to be developed that can be used tor amphibians that inhabit this area. Population gro\vth in Alberta is a 1najor problen1 for Alberta's environn1ent. Population growth may negatively itnpact the biodiversity and water supply in the areas where urban expansion occurs. Conservation management in Albetia needs to address the protection of the land and not just red aim the land after urbanization and industrial

21

development takes place, since reclamation in Alberta can not keep up with urban and industrial development (Government of Alberta, 2007: 36). As urbanization negatively impacts biodiversity, determining how to protect and reclaim areas for specific species, such as the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog, is a necessary conservation management approach to guide future land-use in this area, which is most likely to be urban expansion (Government of Alberta, 2007: 25). Agriculture in Alberta has negatively i1npacted wetland. Various land covers, including wetland and peatland have been cleared to support agriculture expansion (Wilson et al. 2001: 3, 11 ). Wetland has also been drained to for agriculture, as over one million acres of land is irrigated in Alberta (Govenunent of Alberta, 2007: 18; Wilson et al. 2001: 18). Even though agriculture has been a hindrance on wetland, agricultural land is now being converted into urban and rural developments creating hardscape and fragn1entation (Goven1ment of Alberta, 2007: 20).
2:3 Amphibians in Alberta

In Alberta, there are ten amphibian species. Eight species are frogs and toads: the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), boreal chorus frog (Pseudadcris trieseriata n1aculata), Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), boreal toad (Bufo boreas), the Canadian toad (Bufo hemiophrys), great plains toad (Bufo
cognatus), and the plains spadefoot toad (Spea bombifrons). The other two amphibian

species found in Alberta are salamanders: the long--toed salamander (Ambystoma
macrodactylun1) and the tiger salamander (A1nbysto1na tigrinum).

Out of the ten species found in Alberta, only three species are classified as secure: the boreal chorus frog, the wood frog, and the tiger salamander (Alberta Conservation

22

Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Developtnent, 2001: 15, 28, 25; Wilkinson and Berg, 2004: 8). A species that is classified as secure is not at risk of extinction and not sensitive to human activities, the distribution of the species is widespread, the total population size is large (greater than 10,000), and there is no threat to the species' population and habitat (Fish and Wildlife Service, 2000: 3, 5, 7). It is obvious that conservation efiorts need to focus on the protection of amphibians in Alberta, since less than one third of amphibians have been classified as secure. Secure species are species that are not at risk to extinction or extirpation and do not require special attention or protection (Fish and Wildlife Service, 2000: 3). 2:4 General Description of the Wood Frog (Rana svlvatica) The wood frog (Rana sylvatica) is a true frog, since it is part of the Ranidae family. The wood trog is one of the smallest species in the Ranidae family; the

maximum recorded size of the \vood frog is 6.5 em. lt has a black stripe running across the side of its eyes with a white stripe below it There is also a dark stripe running from the nostril to the eye. There are two folds running across the back, which are known as dorsolateral folds, and are contrasting to the background colour. Dark crossbands can also be found on the hindlegs (MacCuUoch, 2002: 84). The background colour of the wood frog can be brown, black, pink, or coppery (Cochran and Goin, 1970: 78). The wood frog's normal diet consists of worms and insects. The breeding season for this frog normally stmis in April and can run until June; however, once the breeding period tor a population starts, the period is very short and may only last up to two weeks (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development,

23

2001 : 35-36). During the breeding season, the· call of the male frogs sounds like the quacking of ducks (Cochran and Goin, 1970: 78). The wood frog has the widest range in Canada out of ali ·the amphibian species (MacCuHoch, 2002: 84). In Alberta, it also has a very wide range (Figure 1). It has a very high cold tolerance and therefore can be found at high elevations and is known to be found farther north than any other amphibian. The wood frog is on the Green List in the Status of Alberta Wildlife report. If an organistn is on the Green List, it means the

organis1n's populations in Albetia are not declining (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, 2001: 35-36). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), that determines an organism's status in Canada, has also classified the wood fi·og to not be at risk (MacCuUoch, 2002: 84). 2:5 General Description of the Boreal Chorus Frog (Pseudacris triseriatamaculata) The boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata maculata) is a member of the Hylidae family (tree trogs) and is not a true frog, since itdoes not have dorsolateral folds on its back like the true frogs (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, 2001: 28-29). Because it is a tree frog, small discs can be found on the fingers and toes (Froom, 1982: 92). Even though the boreal chorus frog is a tree frog, it is rarely found in trees, since is has the shortest legs of any tree frog (Cochran and Goin, 1970: 117). The boreal chorus frog has a black stripe running out from the side of its eyes, and it also runs down the side of its body. It has three dark lines running along its back that can be broken or be in the fom1 of spots. Its background colour can be grey, brovvn, or green, and its belly is white. The boreal chorus frog is smaller than the wood

24

frog with a tnaximum recorded size of 3 ctn. This frog can be confused with another tree frog found in Canada: the western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata triseriata). The boreal chorus frog can be distinguished fron1 the western chorus frog by its shorter hind limbs. Also, the ranges of the boreal chorus frog and western chorus frog do not overlap {MacCuHoch, 2002: 80). The boreal chorus frog eats many invertebrates, such as insects. The breeding season for the boreal chorus frog also begins in April and can run until June (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, 2001: 28-29). During the breeding season, the caH of the n1ales sounds like the scratching of hair combs (MacCuHoch, 2002: 80). The boreal chorus frog, like the wood frog, has a very large range in Alberta (Figure 2); it can be found aln1ost anywhere, except for alpine environments. This frog is also on the Green List in the Status of Alberta Wildlife Report (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Developtnent, 2001: 28-29). COSEWIC has also classitied the boreal chorus frog to not be at risk (MacCuHoch, 2002: 80). Even though the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog are on the Green List, their habitat characteristics and the methods required to sustain non-declining populations need to be investigated, since amphibians, in general, are declining (Young et al, 2004: 7). By exmnining the habitat needs of the wood fi·og and boreal chorus frog, certain relationships may be found to contribute to our understanding why these two species have healthy populations in Alberta. Certain relationships that support amphibians with healthy

populations could be used as guides for further research on an1phibians \Vith less healthy populations, such as the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) that has an overlapping

25

range with the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog (Alberta Sustainable Resource Develop111ent, 2003: 6, 9, 20). HSI tnodels can be used to determine how future changes in the selected geographic area may affect populations of wood frogs and boreal chorus frogs during the breeding season (Downey et aL 2004). These species-specific models can also be used as a guide for other amphibians, since some of the habitat characteristics relationships may overlap with the habitat characteristics of other amphibian spectes inhabiting the same and neighbouring geographic areas.

Chapter 3: Habitat Models Developed From the Literature 3: I Introduction This chapter describes how preliJninary habitat suitability index (HSI) models were developed for the wood fi·og (Rana sylvatica) and the boreal chorus frog
(Pseudacris triseriata maculata). No HSI model \Vas developed for the northe111 leopard

frog (Rana pipiens) because there were no northern leopard frogs found during the fieldwork. The prelin1inary models represent the first four phases of developing a HSI tnodel: model objective determination, model variable identification, model construction, and model docun1entation (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 - 3-4). The

developed models in this chapter are sttictly based on previous research and not the fieldwork that was conducted for this study. By developing preliminary n1odels, key habitat variables could be identified and \Vere used as a guide for investigation dwing the fieldwork that was conducted for this study (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 3-4). 3:2 Habitat Suitability Index Models HSI models are word or tnechanistic models that are used to detennine the quality of habitat for a specific species based on certain habitat conditions (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 1-1 - 1-2). The original methodology was developed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) to meet new legal Acts related to environmental protection. The USFWS needed to develop a methodology for conducting habitat assessments to tneet the requiretnents stated by the amendments of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (1934) and the Endangered Species Act (1973). The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act states that the USFWS tnust conduct surveys to determine

28

inventories and the status of United States fish and wildlife resources; the Endangered Species Act states that habitat for a particular species can be designated as critical habitat by conducting biological assessments. By designating land as critical habitat, the type and amount of developn1ent allowed on the land is limited. The method involves Key habitat

developing a documented n1odel from measurable key habitat variables.

variables are identified by determining significant relationships between the population dynan1ics of a species and variables related to its habitat by examining the literature or by empirical observation. Before the HSI model1nethod was developed, habitat quality was detern1ined in a subjective fashion by a team of biologists; no standard methods or data were used (Division of Ecological Services, 1980a: 2.3-2.5). The HSI model's ptitnary purpose is to detennine the baseline quality and amount of habitat for a specific species and to determine how proposed land and water developments tnay impact the habitat quality and quantity in the future for that specific species. The 1nodel is based on compating existing habitat conditions for a specific species with its ideal habitat conditions. Ideal habitat conditions are the habitat

conditions of sites where the highest population densities of the specific species are found in the selected area (Division of Ecological Services, 1980a: 5.1 ). There are advantages and disadvantages to using the HSI model n1ethod. One advantage is that the baseline habitat quality and quantity in a selected area for a specific species can be determined based on a standardized method using standard data. Standard data are data collected using identical, documented procedures in order to control extraneous variables so other scientists can obtain similar results (Zolman, 1993: 5, 8). Once the status of a species is determined, conservation and land-use alternatives can be

29

developed in the decision-making process for future land and water developments (Division of Ecological Services, 1980b: 3-2). Since HSI models can be a controHed and cost-effective means to determine the status of one species' habitat, they can be used as a component of ecological assessments that are required by various authorities (Kapustka, 2005). The degree of impact for a particular land or water development can be predicted by comparing trade-offs in that land or water developn1ent (Division of Ecological Services, 1980b: 3-2). The disadvantage of predicting future changes using an

assess1nent model is that future habitat changes can not be measured with a high level of confidence; they can only be estimated or predicted. The level of confidence of modeling may not be very high, and for this habitat model, a species may still not survive in a habitat, even though good habitat quality was predicted. Also, other environmental

variables that tnay affect the population of a specific species tnay not be considered in the model (Division ofEcological Services, 1980a: 4.3-5.2). Another advantage is that the model can be tailored to the user. One user may require a lower level of detail (lower atnount of habitat variables, lower intensity of monitoring, and lower complexity of data) cotnpared to another user. A lower level of detail for the model allows lower costs and shorter time periods to obtain a 1nodel output (Division of Ecological Services, 1980a: 43). Also, a preliminary model with few

vatiables in a small area allows lower costs and shorter time periods. Once a model is developed, a user may require more extensive data, more habitat variables, or a larger area to allo\v a more accurate analysis of the habitat for a specific species. Once more complex data, more habitat variables, or a larger area is required, the costs to obtain a
n1odel output can be a lot higher, and the time period to conduct habitat variable

30

tneasurements and analyses can requtre a significantly longer time period to reach completion (Division of Ecological Services, 1980b: 2.1-2.2). For example, it is believed to be inefficient to develop a predator HSI model where the predator has various prey for its diet because there would be too many habitat variables to account for the many habitats that the prey use" It would be very difficult to monitor each habitat variable that would be in the model and would require a lot of resources and titne to complete the tnonitoring and analyses (Jones et aL 2002: 94); therefore, HSI models can be very simplistic and can yield ilnprecise predictions (Zielinski et al. 2006). Newer versions of n1odels have beeen developed, which are adaptations of original models. A developed model has specific habitat variables and methods of

determining the condition for each habitat variable, but another user may want to modify those variables or methods in order to reflect a different geographic area or a different function for the model. For example, newer HSI n1odels for the American marten

(Martes americana) in Ontario use different variables frotn the original marten HSI

model in order to reflect a different area (Watt et al. 1996: 8). The original HSI model reflects a geographic area within the United States, but Naylor et al. (1994) wanted a model that reflected habitat quality for the n1arten in central Ontario. They replaced the successional stage variable with a stand height variable in order to accommodate Ontario's Forest Resource Inventory. They then verified the modified model in the field with their marten trapline harvest data collected in central Ontario (Watt et aL 1996: 8). Hodson et al. (2004) have looked at the habitat requirements of the n1arten in Temagami, Ontario, a forest 1nanage1nent unit, to see if there is a difference in habitat requirements than the habitat require1nents in the 1nodel set out by the Ontario Ministry of Natural

31

Resources; the original tnodel reflects Algonquin Park, Ontario. Hodson et al. (2004) discovered that the marten habitat requiretnents were different between Temagami and Algonquin Park and have suggested that modifications of the tnodel need to be tnade in order to reflect the Temagami Forest Managen1ent Unit. Overall, HSI tnodels are simple, basic tools for biologists and natural resource managers and they are good for regional-level conservation planning (Zielinski et al. 2006).
Regional~level

conservation planning involves managing a number of landscapes

that 1nakes a complex of climatic physiographic, biological, econon1ic, social, and cultural characteristics. For example, one region may include an urban, suburban, and agricultural landscape (Forman and Godron, 1986: 13); a HSI model can be developed to reflect the entire region. HSI models that have already been developed can be expanded for other users or modified to reflect the needs of users in different geographic areas. HSI models appear to be a successful tool, as there are cunently 157 published HSI models in the United States (National Wetlands Research Center, 2008); however, most HSI models are still at the stage where they are used to indicate future investigations; only a few have had sotne 1nodel verification where there has been some confirmation of the models' output and relationships between the selected species and the habitat variables used in the tnodel (Jones et al. 2002: 94; Watt et al. 1996: 8). 3:3 Methodology of Constructing a Habitat Suitability Index Model The HSI tnodel methodology, developed by the Division of Ecological Services of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (1981 ), consists of five phases: model objective determination, tnodel variable identification, model construction, n1odel documentation, and tnodel verification. The model objective phase involves detennining

32

the main purpose for developing the model. There are three parts to developing the model objective: defining the ideal and acceptable model output, defining the geographic area to which the model applies, and defining the season .or time period to which the model applies. Both the ideal and acceptable model output has to be between 0 and 1; it is a rating system. An output of 0 1neans the area is very poor habitat for the species and an output of 1 tneans that the area is ideal habitat. The acceptable output represents the acceptable reliability of the model and is determined by correlating the 1nodel output with the carrying capacity of the species in the selected geographic area (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 - 3-4). Key habitat variables can be detennined fro1n observations of previous studies or can be detennined from .fieldvvork; key habitat variables in these preliminary models were detennined only from the literature. Once the key habitat variables were decided, a suitability index for each variable was determined based on the available literature. A suitability index, ·like the model output, is based on a weight system and has a range between 0 and 1. A . suitability index of 1 reflects the ideal conditions for a particular variable; a suitability index of 0 means that the conditions for that particular variable are very poor for the species in question. For each species, each suitability index variable was entered into an equation to generate a HSI tnodeL The model output resulting from the suitability index values being introduced into the model represents the quality of habitat for the selected species in the area. Habitat units that represent the combination of habitat quality and quantity can be determined. by multiplying the HSI model output by the atnount of available habitat for the specific species. The amount of available habitat for a selected species can be the sample area or the total area of cover types that are only

33

used by the selected species in the area. Cover types are specific areas of land with similar charactetistics. For exatnple, a red-tailed hawk uses grassland for food but also uses forest for nesting (Division of Ecological Services, 1981 : 3-1 - 3-18). The general structure of the equation follows a compensatory relationship, where the equation is controlled by a geometric n1ean: [1] HSI =Habitat suitability index n = nmnber of variables vi= suitability index value of variable i The geometric mean allows the lowest value to influence the output. If a tnodel has only two variables, and if one variable has a suitability value of 0.8 and the other has a suitability index value of 0.2, then the output will be 0.4. lf one of the variables has a suitability index value of 0, then the output will be 0 (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-32- 3-33). The fourth phase of developing a HSI model is tnodel documentation. Model documentation involves docum.enting the steps taken to develop each HSI model and justifying each habitat variable relationship by verifying it with previous research (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-50). Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the

documentation of the HSI models for the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog. 3:4 Wood Frog Habitat Suitability Index Model The objective for the wood frog HSI model is to detennine key habitat variables that influence wood frog population dynamics and develop a model that can be used to determine the baseline and future conditions of wood frog habitat during its breeding season. This is a general proximity tnodel; therefore, these suitability indexes reflect the

34

\VOOd fi·og' s entire range in North America and not the specific sample area of this study. The ideal output for the equation is 1, which represents ideal habitat for the wood frog during its breeding season. The model is supposed to have a determined ideal output and acceptable output. The acceptable output represents a reliable output, since it is rare to obtain the ideal output. The acceptable output is detennined by 1neasuring the carrying capacity of the selected species within the geographic area and correlating the carrying capacity with model outputs. It can also be determined by correlating model outputs with other habitat ranking systems that have been developed for the pat1icular species (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 - 3-3). Unfortunately, the acceptable model output could not be determined because the carrying capacity of the wood frog within the sample area was not determined in this study and no other habitat ranking system could be found for the selected species in the selected geographic area. Based on the available literature, four key habitat variables and their suitability indexes were determined for the wood frog during its breeding season. The available literature that was used for selecting the habitat variables revealed the habitat characteristics of the wood fi·og. disagreement between the
sources~

A habitat variable was selected if there was no results. If a habitat
variable~s

relationship with wood

frog population dynamics was controversial in the literature, then it was not selected for the model (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-27). The presence of fish is a significant factor in determining suitable habitat for the wood fi·og. Fish, especiaHy trout, have been found to eat an1phibian eggs and larvae (Young et aL 2004: 36, 38). Also, besides d-irect predation, the introduction of fish into a fish-free water body can also allow the invasion of parasites. Parasites that are harmful to

35

fish can also be harmful to amphibians (Thie1nann and Wassersug, 2000). Wood frog populations can be dramatically reduced by fish preying on their eggs and larvae during their breeding season. During a recolonization study, Petranka et al. (2007) observed a dramatic decrease in wood frog populations because fish invaded the constructed wetland because of beavers and flooding. After the fish invasion, the percentage of constructed ponds that were occupied by wood frogs went from 100% to 30%. vVood frogs are able to breed in the presence of iish, but this may depend on the species of fish that is present. Eaton (2004) found that wood trog larva] survival was negatively impacted by fathead minnows (Pimephales pro·melas) and .brook stickleback
(Culaea inconstans), which are small-bodied fish. Eaton also discovered that wood frog

larvae were not significantly itnpacted by northern pike (Esox lucius) and yellow perch
(Perea flavescens); both of these species are piscivores (fish that prey on other fish for

their diet). Norris (2006) also found that stocking lakes with northern pike has no negative impact on wood frog abundance. Rainbow trout (Onchorhychus my kiss), a

common fish used for stocking in Alberta, is believed to be responsible for the decline in of the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) ·in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, Alberta (James, 1998: 12). In Waterton National Park, Alberta, Pearson (2004) tound that rainbow trout, cutthroat trout (Onchorhychus clarki), golden trout (Onchorhychus
aguqbonita}, and brook trout (Salvelinus fortinalis), all stocked fish, had a significant

negative i1npact on long-toed salamander (An1bystonza n1acrodactylum}

larvae~

In the

salamander' s primary habitat, there were no larvae vvhere trout were present; along the salamander's habitat perimeter, only four of the ten sites that contained trout had larvae.

36

It is possible for wood frogs to breed in sites that contain fish, but with such a

dramatic decrease in site occupancy in the study done by Petranka et al (2007) and having no wood fi·ogs in any of the sample sites looked at by Porej et al (2004), it is assumed that sites containing fish are .poor wood fi·og habitat. Because of the strong impact fish can have on the presence of\vood frogs in a \Vater body and that none of the studies used for the suitability index compared fish populations with wood frog populations, only two suitability index values can be selected for this variable. If fish are not present at the site, then the condition is ideal, .and the suitability index value is 1. Because research has found that wood frogs win be absent from a site containing fish, a selected site
tha~

has

fish present is very poor wood frog habitat, and the suitability index value is 0. Even if northern pike are present at the site, there would still have to be other fish present that could prey on the wood frog. It could be possible to have a higher suitability index value for sites .that contain fish, but studies to see if wood frog populations would ren1ain sustainable would need to be conducted. AU of the studies that were used to determine the suitability index use fish presence as a binary vruiable: fish are present or not present. For future research, wood frog or wood frog larvae abundance can be compared with the amount of fish present at a site in order to have a suitability index that does not rely on binary data. Results in the studies conducted by Petranka et aL (2007) and Pearson (2004) had amphibians present even though fish were present as well. It can be assumed that amphibians, including the wood frog can survive in the presence of fish, but the rate of survival, the tnechanisms for survival, and the difference in survival rate depending the atnount of fish need to be further looked at.

37

Hydroperiod, the duration and frequency that a water body is flooded (Smith and Smith, 200 l : 658), is important for wood frog habitat because they rely on the aquatic environment for egg laying and larvae growth. The hydroperiod is crucial for larvae development, since the eggs or larvae will die if the water body dries up before the larvae metamorphose into juveniles (Brooks, 2004). Permanent water bodies can support wood frog populations, but the populations are often very small con1pared to sen1i-pennanent or non-petmanent water bodies. A permanent water body generally has a higher abundance of predators, such as fish (Boone et aL 2006; Rubbo and Kiesecker, 2005). Since fish usuaHy are incapable of re1naining in temporary or ephemeral water bodies, wood frogs and other amphibians tend to avoid pennanent water bodies; their primary habitats have seasonal or temporary hydroperiods; a water body is classified as having a temporary hydroperiod if it dries up some years (Lichtenberg et al. 2006). Brod1nan et al. (2006) looked at the success of arnphibian recolonization of restored wetland at Kankakee Sands in Indiana (United States). During the study, they discovered that late-stage larvae and tadpoles died from dessication in wetland that dried up before August; ho\vever, fish were found in the pennanent wetland. It may be that fish presence is directly related to permanent water bodies, so the presence of fish may interfere with results when comparing hydroperiod w-ith wood frog populations; however, no known studies have directly related pennanent hydroperiod ·with fish presence, and no known studies have compared the isolated combination with wood frog population dynamics. The suitability index values for the hydroperiod variable are derived trom three sources: Vasconcelos and Calhoun, 2006; Kolozsvary, 2003; Skelly et aL 1999.

38

at these sources, five hydroperiod categories with corresponding suitability index values were determined (Figure 3). For each study, the hydroperiod category with the highest number of wood frogs received a suitability index value of 1 (Table 1). Hydroperiod categories with lower wood frog populations received lower suitability index values by dividing the corresponding wood frog population value by the highest population value in the study. The suitability index values for each hydroperiod category of each study were averaged to determine an overall suitability index value for the model. It is possible that the hydroperiod category with the highest wood frog population in each study is not the ideal condition; however, the only way to determine the ideal condition is to find out the carrying capacity of the wood frog within the sample area that was used for each study (Division of Ecological Services, 1981 ). Table 1. Results from sources that were used to derive the wood frog hydroperiod habitat variable. A temporary pond annually dries up and an intermediate pond dries up some years.

The ideal condition for wood frog aquatic habitat is if the water body has a temporary hydroperiod: the water body dries up every year but does not dry up in less than two months. The poorest condition for ·wood frog habitat during its breeding season is if the hydroperiod is less than hvo months because the eggs and larvae \:viH die tron1 dessication (Vasconcelos and Calhoun, 2006; Egan and Paton, 2004; Kolozsvary, 1988).

39

Boone et aL (2006) found that it takes an average of 87 days from eggs being deposited to larvae reaching metamorphosis, while Brooks (2004) found that it takes between 53-135 days for wood frog eggs to hatch and for the larvae to n1etamorphose into juveniles. Both of these averages are around 3 months, and Brook's n1inhnum is almost hvo months; therefore, it has been assutned that a site that dries up in less than two tnonths is poor wood fi·og habitat. lntennediate ponds (ponds that dry some years) have also been found to support high nutnbers of wood frogs, n1ost likely because predators are unable to establish large pennanent populations dming the drier seasons (Baldwin, 2005; Skelly, 1999).

Figure 3. Suitability index ofhydroperiod for the wood frog. A tetnporary water body is a water body that dries up every year and an intermediate water body is a water body that dries up some years. The third variable for the wood frog HSI model is water n1ovement. Standing water, including ponds, marshes of lakes, and dug-outs are good habitats for wood frogs. Wood frogs can also live in obstructed stremns, but they have not been found to live in streams that are not obstructed (Stevens et al. 2006). An obstructed stream refers to a flowing body of water being obstructed by son1e source, like a beaver dan1, so that the water body primarily consists of standing water. 40

Stevens et al. (2006) found that wood frogs prefer standing \Vater bodies for breeding compared to non-standing water bodies. They found that beaver ponds vvere a primary source of stream obstruction. They have suggested that beaver ponds have a synergistic relationship with wood frogs by obstructing streams and providing \vood debris for female wood frogs to attach their eggs to. Although, they have also suggested that beaver ponds could be a potential problem if there are floods. Floods occurring within an .amphibian habitat that is created by beaver dams could allow fish to invade the habitat. Fish presence in a beaver-created wetland mosaic would have to be managed to sustain a healthy amphibian population. Like the fish presence variable, only two values were determined. If a selected site prin1mily consists of standing water, then the condition for this habitat variable is ideal and the suitability index value is 1. Wood frogs have not been found to be present in flowing bodies of water, so if the selected site is a stream that is not obstructed so that the water is constantly flowing, . the condition for the habitat is very poor and the suitability index value is 0. No research has been found that has compared the gradient of water tlow with . wood frog population dynamics, so a suitability index gradient for standing water could not be developed. Road density is believed to negatively impact wood frog populations by limiting the amount of available habitat and providing geographic barriers between wood frog populations (Egan and Paton, 2004; Findlay, 2001; Findlay and Bourdages, 2000). Roads acting as barriers can limit the amount of gene flow between populations and can also act as a mechanism for killing amphibians due to traffic (Cushman, 2006).
It has been

suggested that road closures should be used as a conservation technique to prevent

41

mortality during amphibian migration periods (Timm et al. 2007). It is also possible that roads are simply a surrogate for urbanization and reflect the amount of habitat fragmentation in the area. It may be difficult to suggest that, other than road-kills, roads impact amphibian populations by causing habitat loss and ·fragmentation. More research is needed to confirm that roads are a source of habitat fragmentation for amphibian populations. There is a very limited body ofresearch that has quantified the negative impact of roads for this pruiicular species; the suitability index for road density was derived only from one source: Rubbo and Kiesecker (2005), so the suitability index for road density may yield a broad output As tnore evidence becomes available, more data can be integrated into the suitability index. The suitability index for road density is in the form of a graph (Figure 4). The first three suitability indexes already discussed can be represented in the form of histograms; the road density suitability index is in the form of a graph because the study that was used to develop the index did not use road density categories (Rubbo and Kiesecker, 2005). Based on the study by Rubbo and Kiesecker (2005), the suitability index values for the model are derived by assigning a suitability index value of 1 to the road density with the highest wood frog population in the study: 3.90 km within 1 km of the wetland. Rubbo and I<iesecker (2005) measured the total length of roads within a 1ktn radius of each site. Rubbo and Kieseckers' (2005) observation was converted fron1 1 km to 1.2 km to get a suitability index value of 4.68 kln of road within 1.2km of the wetland. The suitability index value uses a 1.2-km radius because researchers have found that wood
fi~ogs

can migrate up to 1.2 km (Porej et al. 2004). The suitability index value

was rounded to 5 km of road within 1.2 kln of the wetland, since Rubbo and Kiesecker' s

42

(2005) results reflected their specific sample area. The other suitability index v alue was derived from dividing the .wood frog population value by the highest population value of the road density category that received a suitability index value of 1 (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 - 3-54). In Rubbo and Kiesecker' s (2005) study, 1 I% of the sites occupied by the wood frog had an average road density of 23 km of road within
1 ktn of the wetland, and 86o/o of the sites occupied by the wood frog had an average road

density of 3.90 km of road within 1 km of the \vetland. Dividing 11% by

86~1o

gives a

suitability index value of 0.13; however, the value was rounded to OJ. The road density that had 11% of the sites occupied by the wood frog was also converted to I .2 km radius and rounded to the nearest whole nun1ber. If the road density is 5 km of road within 1.2
km of the wetland or less, then the suitability index value is 1; if the road density is 28 km of road within 1.2 k1n of the wetland or more, then the suitability index value is 0.1

(Rubbo and Kiesecker, 2005).

Road density can be measured from the center of a

wetland, or if the water body is a lake or has quite a large area, then the road density can be measured fron1 the area where the atnphibians are found (Robinson, 2001 ).

Forest cover has been suggested as an important habitat variable for the wood frog, since it is known to be a component of the terrestrial environment (Patrick et aL 2006; Rubbo and I<eisecker, 2005; Porej et aL2004). Other research has found that forest cover is not a significant habitat variable for wood frog populations (Stevens et al. 2006; Vasconcelos and Calhoun, 2006; Skelly, 2004). Since the relationship between forest cover and amphibian population dynamics is controversial, forest cover was not selected for a habitat variable and was not tneasured in this study" Taking the four variables, a HSI model was developed: HSI . Wood Frog - (V F * VH

* V S * VR) 114

[2]

Vr = Fish Presence Suitability Index VH = Hydroperiod Suitability Index V s = Standing Water Suitability Index V R = Road Density Suitability Index The model shows a compensatory relationship, where the relationship is controlled by a geometric mean. A compensatory relationship is when variables with high suitability index values are offset by variables that have low suitability index values. The geotnetric mean takes into account the lowest suitability index value among the habitat variables. If one of the variables has a suitability index value of 0, then the model output is 0. Even though the model is quite general and approximate, it should reflect most environments; it can becon1e more precise as more research on wood frog habitat is conducted in the sample area (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-l - 3-54). The general amount of available habitat for the wood frog is the total sample area; however, to be more specific, the specific amount of available habitat can be determined by calculating the areas of the cover types only used by the wood frog (Division of

44

Ecological Services, l980b:

4~1) .. The

areas of the cover types only used by the wood

frog were not determined in this study. 3:5 Boreal Chorus Frog Habitat Suitability Index.Model The objective for the boreal chorus frog HSI model was to determine key habitat variables that can be integrated into an equation where the output represents the baseline or future conditions of boreal chorus frog habitat during its breeding season. Like the wood frog, the model represents the entire range of the boreal chorus frog and not the sample area of this study. The ideal output for this model is l and the acceptable output could not be detetmined, since the can·ying capacity of the boreal chorus frog within the sample area was not measured. The carrying capacity of the boreal chorus frog in the geographic area will need to be measured in the future. Based on available literature that investigated habitat characteristics of the boreal chorus frog, four key habitat variables and their suitability indexes were determined for the boreal chorus frog during its breeding seaso11:. Habitat variables were selected only if the sources agreed upon the variables' relationship between the population dynamics of the boreal chorus frog. If a variable's relationship 'With the population dynamics of the boreal chorus frog populations was controversial atnong the sources consulted, the variable was not selected for the tnodel (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-27). The first variable considered was fish presence. There is very little research available relating boreal chorus frog populations and fish presence. Since fish presence bas been found to have a negative ilnpact on other amphibian populations (Marsh and Trenham, 2001 ), it is assumed that fish presence will also have a negative impact on boreal chorus frog populations. Like the wood frog, only two suitability index values can

45

be selected. If there are no fish present at a selected site, then the suitability index is 1; if there are fish present at the selected site, the condition for boreal chorus ·frog habitat is very poor and the suitability index value is 0. The second variable is water movement. Stevens et aL (2007) found no calling boreal chorus frog males on their sites that were unobstructed strean1s. Also in their study, boreal chorus frogs were also found to have a positive association with beaver presence; the positive association is believed to occur due to the creation of standing water and wood debris for egg deposits, although there is the possibility that beaver datns can also create habitat for predatory fish. Like the fish presence variable, only two

suitability index values can be selected. If a selected site is composed of standing water, the suitability for boreal chorus frog habitat is ideal and the suitability index value is 1. If the selected site consists of a constant flow of water, the suitability for boreal chorus frog habitat is very poor and the suitability index value is 0. The third variable for the HSI model of the boreal chorus frog is don1inant vegetation. Its suitability index is derived fron1 Burton's (2001) study on breeding

occurrence of amphibians found in the Western Ranger District of the Caribou National Forest in southeast Idaho (United States). Burton (2001) compared amphibian breeding occurrence with the dominant type of vegetation found at the san1ple sites. Four main vegetation types were found at his sites: none (unconsolidated material bed), emergent (sedges and rushes), aquatic (submerged or floating vegetation), and shrub (willows). Burton (2001) found that boreal chorus frogs prefer environments don1inated by emergent vegetation, and smaller populations of boreal chorus frog were also found in environments dominated by aquatic, shrub, or no vegetation. It is surprising that Burton

46

(2001} found boreal chorus frogs on sites that were dominated by no vegetation because

other researchers have found that sites with no vegetation do not provide a suitable medium for boreal chorus frogs to deposit their eggs on or provide shelter fi·mn predation (Stevens et al. 2007; Stevens et al. 2006). ·Only four suitability index values can be selected for this variable; etnergent vegetation is ideal tor boreal chorus frog habitat during the breeding season (Figure 5). The suitability index values for the aquatic, shrub, and no vegetation independent variables were derived by dividing their corresponding boreal chorus frog population values by the population value for emergent vegetation found in Burton's (2001) study. The values \Vere then rounded, since Burton's values were specific to his sample area.

Figure 5. Suitability index of dominant vegetation for the boreal chorus frog. The last variable for the boreal chorus frog HSI model is pond isolation. Only three suitability index values can be selected for the pond isolation variable (Figure 6). The three suitability index values are derived from Burton's (200 1) study. Bution (200 1) looked at the impact of pond isolation on the borea] chorus frog and found that sites with the highest populations \Vere an average of 663.80 1n (SE = 112.20) fro1n the nearest ten

47

ponds. This average value was rounded to 650 1n and was selected as the ideal condition tor boreal chorus frog habitat and has a suitability index value of 1. Burton had 1:\ventyfive boreal chorus frog breeding sites 'Within his sample area. Standard error (SE) is an estimate of variance around the population n1ean. 1 SE gives us a region where 68.26% of the sample means will be found, and 2 SE win give us a region where approximately 95% of the sample n1eans will be found (Gould and Gould, 2002: 126-129).

determined; the two other conditions and their suitability index values were rounded. If a selected site has an average distance to the dosest ten ponds around 400 1n or 900 m, then the suitability index value is 0. 7.

Like the \vood frog HSI model, the model for the boreal chorus frog shows a con1pensatory relationship where the relationship is controlled by a geometric mean. The geometric mean takes into account the lowest suitability index value between the habitat variables. If one of the suitability index values is 0, then the model output is 0. The mnount of available habitat for the boreal chorus frog is the total san1ple area; however, to be more specific, the atnount of available habitat can be subdivided by calculating the areas of the cover types used only by the boreal chorus frog (Division of Ecological Services, 1980b: 4-1 ). The areas of the cover types used only by the boreal chorus frog within the selected geographic area were not determined in this study. The model may be modit1ed as more research on boreal chorus frog habitat is conducted (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 - 3-54). Since there is very little research on boreal chorus frog habitat, the model may most likely yield a very approximate output (Nussbaum et al. 1983: 143). More research is needed to make the model more precise. Developing HSI models based on the literature is a preliminary step. After a model is developed, it needs to be verified by conducting field tests on the selected species. Fieldwork ve1ification will provide a measure of accuracy and better retlection of the geographic area of interest. Fieldwork can be conducted to help detennine if

certain habitat variables have the same significant relationship as the relationships found in the literature. The incorporation of modification into the models can continue to occur as more habitat studies on the vvood frog and boreal chorus frog are conducted (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 - 3-54).

Chapter 4: Fieldwork Methodology
4: 1 Introduction This chapter and the following two chapters represent the remaining three phases of developing a habitat suitability index (HSI) model: tnodel construction, model docutnentation, and model verification. Model documentation involves recording the steps taken to develop the model, how each habitat vmiable is
justified~

and how each

variable is measured in the field. Model verification involves validating the tnodel by using sample data to generate acceptable outputs, having a species authority review the tnodel, and testing the model with field data (Division of Ecological Services, 1981 : 352). 4:2 Study Area Sampling was conducted north of Cochrane,· Alberta. The sample area is pm1 of the Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region, one the three sub-regions that make up the Parkland Natural Region. The sample area was selected because it is near the expanding city of Calgary, Alberta that could have a negative environmental impact on the sample area in the future (Government of Alberta, 2007: 25). The sub-region has a total area of
3921 km2. The geographic area is dominated by rolling to hilly grasslands. Dominant

vegetation includes trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willow shrublands, where the dominant willow is beaked willow (Salix bebbiana ). Chemozems and Gray Chemozems. Dominant soils are Black

There is a very limited mnount of open water

(approximately 1%); however, there are many smaH saturated drainage areas. Native fish found in the Parkland Natural Region include northen1 pike (Esox lucius), yello\v perch

51

(Perea flavescens), brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans), and fathead tntnnow (Pimephales promelas) (Natural Regions Comtnittee, 2006: 106, 109-110).

The sub-region has a short growing season and cool summer, so intensive agriculture does not take place, and there is a high amount of native vegetation. Dominant crops are hay and feed grains. The most popular use of the land is ranching; over sixty percent of the land is used for ranching. Oil and gas exploration, and hunting and camping occur in the area. Overall, it is a rural area with a lo\v population density (Natural Regions Cotnmittee, 2006: 110-111 ). In order to reflect more specific habitat characteristics for the species of interest, the san1ple area was made smaller by looking at satnple sites that are part of the Foothills Parkland Natural
Sub~region

but also the third reach of the Bow River Sub-basin (Figure

7). Reach 3 is behveen the eastern boundary ofBanffNational Park and Bearspaw Dam. Bearspaw Datn is outside the western boundary of Calgary, Alberta. The sample area is within a greater area of735 km2 that makes up the Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region and Bow River Sub-basin (Bow River Basin Council, 2005: 77).

Eight properties in the area north of Cochrane were sampled. Each property had a wetland cotnplex, and up to six wetland sites were sampled on a property. The lowest amount of sites sampled on a property was two. Six properties belonged to landowners: Erik Butters, Andrea Deeves, Monterra Estates, Richard Harding, Garnet and Cheryl Ovans, and Clio S1neeton. The other two properties were Alberta Crown land: Big Hill Springs Provincial Park, and Winchell Coulee. In total, twenty-eight sites were sampled during the sampling period. The exact locations of each sample site and their general location are shown in Table 2. Satnple sites were detem1ined frotn topographic 1naps and the most recent aerial photographs of the area. Aerial photographs were collected frotn the Alberta Air Photograph Interpretation Library. Marshes, swamps, dug-outs, ponds, lakes, and streams were identified in the maps and photographs and visited before the sampling period. Sample sites were selected if the landowner(s) granted permission to conduct sampling and if they were not too far from a road (Heyer et al. 1994: 42). Sites that were too far from a road were not selected for safety purposes. It would have been better to have more san1ple sites, but it was difficult to obtain permission from other lando·wners. Satnpling was conducted between ·April21, 2007 and May 9, 2007. 4:3 Frog Population Sampling Male frogs are capable of producing mating calls that are unique to each species. During the breeding season, acoustic signals from caHing males can be heard in the frog's territory. Male frogs use these calls to attract females and to cotnpete with other tnales for a mate (Kelley, 2004). Because each call is unique to the species, calling surveys can be conducted to determine the general population of the species of interest at a particular site by measuring the calling intensity of the males (Takats and Priestley, 2002: 1). This

53

monitoring technique is not as accurate as other n1onitoring techniques, such as the markrecapture technique, because the exact population can not be determined, especially if calls are overlapping or if there is a full chorus of calling males at the site; however, it is a reasonably easy technique and requires few resources (Pellet and Schmidt, 2005). Nevertheless, calling surveys are a very comtnon monitoring technique for many fi·og species, especially when it comes to relying on volunteers to cotnplete a comprehensive survey of an ecosystem (Davis and Verrell, 2005; Ford and Hampton, 2005; Schmidt and PeHet 2005; Pierce and Gutzwiller, 2004). The calling surveys followed the protocol for the northern leopard frog developed by the Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development of the Alberta Government. Calling surveys were conducted during the optimum monitoring titne between late April and early May, from Apri121, 2007 to May 9, 2007, which is during the breeding season of each species (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Developn1ent, 2001: 28-29, 35-36). Calling surveys were started after dark at each site. Each calling survey lasted ten minutes: five minutes to allow disturbance from arrival to subside and five minutes for the actual calling survey. Wind speed and air ten1perature were taken at each site using a Kestrel 3000 weather meter, since a fast wind speed can dmnpen the calling sound and the optimum air temperature for male calling is equal to or above 1OOC (Kendell, 2002b: 16). Each site was tnonitored using caUing surveys three thnes during the sampling period to take into account tneasurement error and outliers (Zolman, 1993: 98-99, 138). Calling intensity is based on a categorical ranking syste1n: rank 1 = none heard, rank 2 = one frog heard, rank 3 = individuals counted, rank 4 = several individuals heard

54

with sotne overlap, and rank 5

=

fuU continuous chorus (Kendell, 2002b: 16). A more

accurate population can be determined from the first three ranks by taking into consideration the sex ratio of the species. The sex ratio for wood frogs is 1:1. A less accurate population can be determined from the last two ranks (Stevens et al. 2007). There is no literature that reveals the sex ratio for the boreal chorus frog, so a conservative sex ratio of I :1 was used. 4:4 Habitat Characteristics Water chemistry was tneasured at each site using a multi-parameter field probe. Water chemistry was measured to get a better ecological perspective of each site (Brower etal. 1998: 73-74), and the water parameters were correlated with amphibian populations. The probe model was a Hanmet HI9828
multi~paratneter

water quality probe. Parameters

for water chemistry that were measured using the field probe were pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and ·conductivity. Water chemistry measuren1ents were taken from at least three points at each site to get a mean value for each water chemistry parameter. Dominant vegetation was estimated at each site using visual surveys. Dominant vegetation types were emergent and shrub. Sites that had primarily bare ground were classified as having no vegetation. The presence of fish and whether the site was

obstructed to prevent the . continuous flow of water were determined using visual surveys and through consultation ·with landowners. Road density was tneasured using the most recent aerial photographs that \Vere available from the Alberta Air Photograph Interpretation Library and topographic maps. Using aerial photographs and topographic tnaps, unpaved, paved, and total road density were 1neasured within a 1.2-km radius for each site, since wood frogs have been known

55

to migrate up to 1.2 kn1

(Por~j

et al. 2004 ).

There is no infom1ation on migrating

distances for the boreal chorus frog, so a 1.2-km radius was assun1ed. A transparency circle with a radius of 1.2 km was placed over each site on an aerial photograph or topographic map. The radius of the circle matched the scale of each photograph or map. Placing the center of the circle over the water body, the total lengths of unpaved and paved roads were measured that were within the circle. If the water body \Vas quite large, such as a Jake, the center of the circle was placed on the bordering \vetland where amphibians were found calling. Also, using a transparency with a 1.2-km radius, the number of wetlands was measured (Robinson, 2001 ). The area of each site and average distance to the closest ten ponds were also measured using aerial photographs (Burton,
2001).

4:5 Statistical Analysis of Habitat Variables Correlation analysis was used to investigate relationships and how strong the relationships were between the maximun1 rank of each species found at each site and the nutnber of wetlands, area, unpaved road density, paved road density, total road density, the average distance to the ten closest ponds, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, water ten1perature, and air temperature. The ranking system for the calling surveys categorical; the data are ordinal and non-parametric; therefore, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used (Gould and Gould, 2002: 16; Zolman, 1993: 156-157). Correlation analysis was performed using the computer progrmn SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. 2007). Chi-square analysis was used to determine relationships between frog populations of each species and dominant vegetation, fish presence, and water movetnent. These

56

habitat variables were in the fom1 of categorical data that do not have divisible numbers, so con·elation analysis could not be performed (Gould and Gould, 2002: 16, 190). In order to complete the analysis, the population of each species was estimated. For sites that had a maximum rank of 1 and 2, the number of calling males for each species was simply added. For sites that had a tnaxitnum rank of 3., the maximum nun1ber of calling males between the sites was averaged, and then the average number of calling males \Vas multiplied by the nun1ber of sites that had a maximum rank of 3. If there were 8 sites that had an average number of 6 calling male wood frogs, then the total would be 48 calling male wood frogs. The same process was done for sites that had a maximum rank of 4. Unfortunately, the exact number of calling males found at sites that had an amphibian call survey rank of 5 could not be determined, so the nun1ber of calling males for rank 5 had to be estimated follo\ving Pellet and Schmidt (2005). The number of calling males for rank 5 was double the maximum number of calling males for rank 4. The maximum nun1ber of calling male wood frogs for sites that had a rank of 4 was 8, so the estimated number of calling males for sites that had a rank of 5 was 16. For the boreal chorus frog, the n1axin1um nutnber of calling tnales at sites with a rank of 4 was also 8, so the estimated number of calling n1ales at sites with a rank of 5 was 16. TI1is estimation was made in order to keep statistical analysis less cotnplicated because there were only two to three sites that had a rank of 5 for each frog. For each species, the number of sites that had achieved a maximum rank of 5 was multiplied by 16; e.g. 3 sites with tnaximum rank 5 x I 6 = 48 calling males). Adding the totals from ranks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 together gave the total number of calling 1nales for each frog within the sample area.

57

There is uncertainty in estimated populations, since there are few sites and calling surveys do not result in an exact population count (Heyer et al. 1994: 92, 96); however, it was not expected to have a large number of sites that had a rank of 5 for either species, so the method is adequate for this study. A more accurate nu1nber for rank 5 can be

determined as more research is conducted on this particular population measurement problem. It is possible to have a better estilnation of calling tnales for ranks 3 and 4 by combining results from egg-mass surveys and mark-recapture surveys. The results fron1 this con1bination technique can give a more accurate number of calling males for ranks 3 and 4 that can be used for future calling surveys (Stevens, 2006). In this study, egg-mass surveys or mark-recapture surveys were not conducted. Once the total number of males was determined for each species, the population was doubled to account for the nun1ber of females present. The conservative sex ratio \Vas used because there was not enough research to suggest a different ratio (Stevens,
2006). Chi-square analysis was then performed on \¥ood frog and boreal chorus frog

populations in relation to dominant vegetation, fish presence, and water moven1ent. The first chi-square analyses investigated an equal ratio between the expected variables. There were three null hypotheses: do1ninant vegetation, water movement, and fish presence has no effect on the population of wood frogs or boreal chorus frogs during the breeding season within the sample area. If the null hypothesis for dominant

vegetation was rejected, then a new hypothesis would be n1ade: the population of wood fi·ogs or boreal chorus frogs does not follow the dominant vegetation ratio of l :0.1 :0.2 (emergent, shrub, and no vegetation). The ratio was taken trom Burton's (2001) results. If the null hypothesis for water n1ovement was rejected, then a new hypothesis was made:

58

the population of wood frogs and boreal chorus fi·ogs does not follow the ratio 100: 1 (stream obstructed: stream not obstructed). The ratio is based on the suitability indexes for water moven1ent in the prelilninary models. If the nun hypothesis tor fish presence was rejected, then a new hypothesis was n1ade: the population of wood frogs or boreal chorus fi·ogs does not follow the ratio of 100:1 (no fish present: fish present). The ratio is based on the suitability indexes for fish presence in the preliminary models. For the first nun hypothesis of each variable, it is expected that they will be rejected for each amphibian species. For the second null hypothesis of each variable, it is expected the chisquare analysis for these cotnparisons will result in a failure to reject for each an1phibian species, as the ratios reflect the expected ratios based on the literature revievv for each species.

Chapter 5: Results

5: 1 Calling Surveys The maximum rank and maximum estimate of calling males of each species at each site are shown in Table 3. The maximum estimate of calling males could not be determined for sites that had a rank of 5. Out the twenty-eight sites, wood fi·ogs were found at tlfteen sites and boreal chorus frogs were found at nineteen sites. As Table 3 shows, wood frogs and boreal chorus frogs were both present at twelve sites.
Obviously~

this reveals that the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog have overlapping cover types within the sample area. The northern leopard frog was not found at any of the sample sites, even though, based on literature, its range overlaps with the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog. 5:2 Habitat Variables The area varied greatly among the sample sites. The smallest area \vas 18m2 and the largest area was 3360 m2 · Road density, the number of wetlands, and average distance to the closest l 0 ponds also varied. AU of the sites had unpaved roads, but some sites did not have paved roads within a 1.2-km radius. The most isolated site was the third site of Monterra Estates; where there were only three wetland sites within 1.2 km, and the average distance to the closest ten ponds was 1220 tn. These data can be found in Tables 4a and 4b. The n1ost dominant vegetation was emergent vegetation (Table 5). The emergent vegetation was con1posed mostly of herbaceous grasses and cattails. Some sites had no vegetation or not enough to be don1inant. The n1ajority of the vegetation found at the sites was dead because at the beginning of the sample period, some sites still had frozen water or there was snow still on the riparian area. TI1is supports the short

61

gro,ving season of the Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region (Natural Regions Committee, 2006: 109-11 0). Since the majority of the vegetation was dead, a vegetation species inventory was not conducted .because it would be difficult to identify the vegetation. Fish were found at only one site. There were only four sites that were

strean1s and only two of then1 were unobstructed. The two sites that were obstructed were obstructed by beaver ponds. The rest of the sites were ponds, marsh, dug-outs, and drainage areas. The mean pH of the water at the sites ranged between slightly acidic and slightly alkaline. The lowest mean pH was 6.757 (SE 8.718 (SE
= =

0.084) and the highest n1ean pH was
=

0.025).

The n1ean pH of aH the sites was 7.92 (SE

0.05).

When

comparing the n1ean pH and n1aximu1n ranks of the wood frog, the pH drops as the nun1ber of wood frogs increases (Figure 8). The dissolved oxygen of the water at the sites ranged greatly as did the conductivity, but both decreased as nu1nber of wood frogs increased (Figures 9 and 10), and the dissolved oxygen dropped as the nmnber of boreal chorus frogs increased (Figure 11 ). The lowest 1nean dissolved oxygen measurement was 0.990 ppn1 (SE (SE
= =

0.387) at site 5 of Clio Smeeton's property and the highest was 11.540

1.470) at site 1 at Big Hill Springs Provincial Park. The lowest n1ean conductivity

measurement was 64 J1S/cn1 (SE = 5.9) at site 5 on Clio Smeeton's property, and the highest was 2681 JJ.S/cnl (SE = 416.3) at site 3 ofMonterra Estates. These data can be found on Table 6. The air temperature range was between -0.3°C and lS.8°C. temperature range was 7.2°C (SE
=

The 1nean water

0.3) and the air temperature range was 18.3°C (SE ==

0.4). Mean air and water temperature measurements can be found on Table 7.

5:3 Statistical Analysis Speam1an rank correlation analysis was used to compare relations between the maximum ranks of each amphibian and the habitat variables from Table 4a, Table 4b, Table 6, and Table 7 (Tables 8a and 8b). Habitat variable conelations were classified as significant if their probability value (p) was below a significance level (a) of 0.05. For the wood frog, total road density surprisingly had a strong positive relationship (rs = 0.412, p = 0.029). Other significant habitat vatiables were pH (rs
=

-0.231, p = 0.023),

70

dissolved oxygen (rs = -0.252, p = 0.0013), and conductivity (rs = -0.352, p = 0.000) for the wood frog and dissolved oxygen for the boreal chorus fi·og. The number of wetlands for the wood fi·og was one habitat variable that was not classified as significant but had a probability value below 0.10 (rs = 0.346, p looked at in future studies.

= 0.072); this habitat variable should still be

Another habitat variable that did not have a significant

relationship but could be significant in future studies was unpaved road density. Two habitat variables had significant correlations with boreal chorus frog populations: dissolved oxygen (rs = -0.325, p = 0.001) and water temperature (rs = 0.253,

p

=

0.013). No other habitat vatiable had a significant correlation with a probability

below 0.1 0. The average distance to the closest ten ponds could have a significant relationship with boreal chorus fi·og populations in the future.

Chi-square analyses were performed on estimated total populations of each amphibian with dominant vegetation, fish presence, and water movement. In all of the
chi~square

analysis tables, the values for each part of the chi-square process are shown.

If the total D2/Expected is larger than the ctitical value, then the nuB hypothesis is rejected. For both amphibians, the chi-square analyses supported that wood frogs and boreal chorus frogs do not randomly go to sites dotninated by emergent vegetation, shrub vegetation, or no vegetation duting the breeding season; the null hypotheses were rejected (Tables 9a and 1Oa). Having different results than Burton (2001 ), the wood frogs and boreal chorus frogs were not distributed over the same ratio for dominant vegetation; the ne\v hypotheses were rejected (Tables 9b and 1Ob). A third chi-square analysis was done and used another new hypothesis of 1:0.084:0 (en1ergent:shrub:none). The chisquare analysis results suggest that the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog follow this pattern; .the analysis failed to reject the second new hypotheses (Tables 9c and 1Oc ).

72

The chi-square analyses ·supported the same patterns for fish presence and \Vater movement that are shown in the prelitninary models. ; the nun hypotheses were rejected. Both frogs breed at sites regardless of whether the site has fish or does not have fish, and they breed at sites regardless if the sites have . . stremns that are obstructed or not obstructed. The analyses also suppm1ed the new hypothesis that both frogs follow the expected pattern of 100:1 for fish presence (fish are not present:fish are present) and 100:1 for water movement (stream is obstructed: stream is not obstructed), as there was a failure in the rejection of the new hypotheses. The results from the other chi-square analyses are shown in Tables lla to 14b.

Chapter 6: Discussion
6:1 Introduction

There were significant relationships between certain habitat variables and populations of the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog. Most relationships suppotied results found in other studies, and son1e relationships were not consistent with results found in other research. Also, there were no relationships between certain habitat

variables, even though significant relationships were expected. These findings may support the developn1ent of HSI n1odels that are different than the preliminary models that were based on results found only in literature. 6:2 Fish As expected, an the sites that that had amphibian species present did not contain fish. Only one site contained fish (site 2 on Andrea Deeves~ property), and it did not have any atnphibians present.
It was difficult to find sites within the sample area that

I

contained fish. In the Government of Alberta trout stocking database, there were no sites found within the sample area (Fisheries Management Information System, 2007). It may be necessary to find more sample sites that contain fish in order to have more sensitive statistical test (Zolman, 1993: 87-88). It is possible to determine if lakes, ponds, or wetlands contain fish using n1innow traps (Stevens et al. 2006); however, some water bodies still had son1e parts frozen and there were not enough personnel and time to discover a sufficient number of sites that contain fish. Many researchers have found that wood frog populations decrease when sites contain fish (Petranka et al. 2007; Stevens et aL 2006; Egan and Paton, 2004; Porej et a1. 2004; Regosin et al. 2003; Thietnann and Wassersug, 2000). Petranka and Holbrook

78

(2006) tested recolonization success of wood frogs in restored wetland in Graham County, New York (United States). They found that recolonization rates of wood frogs were high until a fish invasion occurred. Egg masses were not found in more than half of the ponds that contained fish; out of those ponds, the egg mass decline was more than 98%. When the fish disappeared, wood fi·ogs recolonized and egg masses were found. This behaviour can be seen in other mnphibians as well. Knapp et al. (2007) found that the 1nountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) inhabited streams once the fish were removed from them.
It still has not been discovered if amphibians choose to breed at a site regardless

of fish presence. Eaton (2004) looked at populations of wood frogs at sites before and after fish winterkills in northern Alberta. He tound that wood frog populations were higher after a fish winterkill; however, he could not determine if more wood frogs chose to migrate to the site because there were less fish. Wood . frogs are known to be

philopatric, as adults retmn to the same water body to breed. If wood frogs return to the san1e site, they may breed at the site regardless of whether fish ·are present there or not; the wood frog population may be .}ow at a site that contains fish simply because the fish prey upon wood frog adults and larvae (Eaton, 2004). There are many conservation efforts that have realized the negative impact of fish and conservationists are trying to create and restore ephemeral wetland or take out the fish found in permanent wetland. Petranka et al. (2003a) and Petranka et al. (2003b) studied .the success of amphibian recolonization in created wetland at the Tulula Wetlands Mitigation Bank in North Carolina (United States). The wetland was created because of the loss of natural habitat due to converted golf course ponds. Seven semi-

79

permanent wetlands and three permanent wetlands were created; all of thetn were intentionally made fish-free. There are some frogs that do survive in the presence offish, but since wood frogs are historically kno\vn to live in wetlands that do not have fish, the introduction of fish by invasion or for recreational purposes should have a detrimental effect (Stevens et aJ. 2006; Hazell et aL 2001 ). The results cotnparing boreal chorus frog populations with fish presence also support the negative impact of fish. The results of fieldwork conducted in this project support the general hypothesis that fish presence negatively impacts the presence of an1phibians (Marsh and Trenham, 2001). More research is needed to continue to support the negative relationship between the boreal chorus frog and :tlsh presence during the breeding season. 6:3 Standing Water Both amphibian species seemed to favor habitats that had non-flowing water, since the majority of the sites in this study were non-flowing and only one site that was flowing had boreal chorus fi-ogs present Other studies have also found that wood frogs tend to avoid unobstructed bodies of water that have a continuous flow (Stevens et al. 2006; Stevens, 2005; Egan and Paton, 2004; Petranka et al. 2003). It is suggested that wood frogs avoid non-obstructed strean1s in order to avoid predators such as fish (Stevens et aL 2006). It is possible that fish presence interferes with the relationship between standing water and wood frog populations; however, flowing water bodies also negatively impact amphibians by washing away deposited eggs and larvae (Hossack and Com, 2005). Mesocosms could be used to better detennine how unobstructed streams impact amphibians. There are some species that do breed in streams, but in North

80

A1nerica, there are not very many (Semlitsch and Bodie, 2003). Based on the North American Monitoring Program (NAAMP) database, only twenty-four out of five hundred and seventy-three species are streatn breeding, and wood frogs are classified as a pond breeding species (Green, 2003). The boreal chorus :trogs tend to follow the same habitat requirement; however, there was one site that was an unobstructed stream but ·had boreal chorus fi:ogs present. Hossack and Corn (2005) looked at boreal chorus frog presence and stream obstruction. In their study, larvae and calling frogs were occasionally found in streatns, but once a heavy rainfall cmne, the larvae were washed away. The streams were then declared to not be ideal habitat for breeding purposes, since the eggs and larvae could not stay grounded (Green, 2003). Stevens et al. (2006) compared boreal chorus frog presence and the presence of beaver dams. The researchers found a positive relationship with boreal chorus frog populations and beaver dams. They also did not :tind any boreal chotus frogs on sites that were unobstructed streams or water bodies that had a continuOlJS flow. A beaver dmn can stop the flow of a water body and provide suitable habitat for boreal chorus frogs; however, there is the possibility that beaver dan1s can provide habitat for predatory fish if the area is flooded (Stevens et aL 2006). Boreal chorus frogs have also been classified as pond-breeding amphibians under the Resources Inventory Comtnittee in British Columbia (Hengeveld, 1999: 2). 6:4 Dominant Vegetation Most of the sites that .had wood frogs · or boreal chorus frogs present were dotninated by emergent vegetation. Other studies have found that the \vood frogs favor sites dominated by etnergent or woody vegetation (Hokit and Brown, 2006; Stevens et al.

81

2006; Egan and Paton, 2004). Most of the etnergent ·vegetation found at the sites was herbaceous vegetation that included various grasses and cattails. Emergent vegetation is also the dominant vegetation for other species of frogs, and emergent vegetation can include herbs, grasses, reeds, sedges, and rushes (Parris and Linderunayer, 2004; Jansen and Healy, 2003). Woody or shrub matetial that is submerged, such as the roots and branches of willows, can also be suitable vegetation for the wood frog (Stevens et al. 2006). There is limited research that has investigated the impact of vegetation type and boreal chorus frog presence. Burton (200 1) found that 7 5% of the sites were dotninated by emergent vegetation. This study was done in the Western Ranger District of Caribou National Forest in southeast Idaho (United States). The emergent vegetation found

during his study included sedges and rushes. Cotnparing the results frmn Burton's study and this study and taking into consideration that the boreal chorus frog' s range and wood frog's range overlap, it is safe to assume that both the habitats of the wood frog and of the boreal chorus frog in Alberta are primarily dominated by emergent vegetation. Wood frogs, boreal chorus frogs, and other mnphibians use vegetation for ovipositing, shelter from extreme weather, and protection from predators (Parris and Lindenmayer, 2004). Sites with no vegetation at all are poor habitats for these frogs (HazeH et al. 2001 ); they do not provide suitable material to attach eggs during the breeding season or provide protection. Most of the vegetation found at the sample sites in this research project was dead, but it still can provide the same uses for amphibians as live vegetation. Conservation managers have realized that increasing the vegetation

density at a site allows an increase in amphibian populations because of the increased

82

protection from fish, since there is less open water (Lichtenberg et al. 2006; Hamer et al. 2002). Researchers are realizing . that sites with dense vegetation in the riparian and terrestrial area surrounding a wetland are an important need for amphibian conservation (Lee et al. 2006; Urbina-Cardona et aL 2006; Bulger et al. 2003; Lemckert and Brassil, 2000). The distance to the nearest forest cover and the area of forest cover within the core terrestrial habitat have also been studied because they are believed to have an impact on amphibian population dynamics (Patrick et al. 2006; Rubbo and Kiesecker, 2005; Porej et aL 2004). Future research efforts are required ·to find out how vegetation and

which vegetation types support amphibian populations both in the aquatic and terrestrial environment. 6:5 Water Quality Wood frog populations had a significant negative correlation with all three water chemistry paran1eters in this research project. There is limited literature that has studied water chen1istry and its relationship with wood frog populations, and observations between the different sources are quite variable. Laposata and Dunson (2000) .discovered a significant relationship between pH and wood frog populations, but Campbell et al. (2004) found no significant relationship between water. chemistry and wood frog populations. Wood frog populations had the strongest negative correlation with conductivity (-

0.353,p = <0.001). Measuring the conductivity of the water detetmines how much solute
is in the \Vater by using an electric current. Pure water has a high resistance to electtic cun·ent, so if a conductivity probe was immersed into pure water, little electric cunent

83

would pass through the water resulting in the water having a very low conductivity. As more solutes are discharged into the water, the water's resistance to electric current is reduced. A high conductivity n1eans that there is a high amount of solute in the water (Wetzel and Likens, 2000: 100). Since the wood frog populations had such a strong negative relationship with conductivity, it is suggested that wood frogs prefer water with Jess solute during the breeding season. Purer \Vater must be better for larvae and adults. Larvae may need purer water in order to grow healthy, since amphibian eggs have no shell protection and are directly exposed to the particles and toxins found in the water (Stebbins and Cohen, 1997: 162; Beebee, 1996: 16, 137). Adults may need purer water, since they have permeable skin that directly exposes them to toxic solute that could be in the water (Young et al. 2004: 7). For pH, the evidence suggests that wood frogs prefer slightly acidic to slightly alkaline waters. When cotnparing the mean pH and tnaximum ranks, the pH drops as the number of wood frogs decreases; however the results are not significant (Figures 8 and 9). In Alberta, most water is slightly alkaline due to the high amount of bicarbonate found in the sediment Because of the high buffering capacity of Alberta's surface water, a high amount of acidic material would be needed to bring down the pH of the water to the point where it may hann amphibians that inhabit the \vater (Mitchell and Prepas,

1990: 23). The pH of the water needs to be fairly acidic in order to harm wood frogs; the
LC 5o (the concentration to kill 50% of the satnple population) of pH on wood frog larvae is 4.10 (Sadinski and Dunson, 1992). Laposata and Dunson (2000) compared atnphibian presence with natural wetland and wastewater-itTigated \vetland. One of the water

chetnistry parameters they looked at was pH. They found that wood frog populations

84

were lower in the. wastewater-irrigated wetland.

The wastewater-irrigated wetland a
wastewater~

higherpH than the pH of the natural wetland; however, the mean pH of the irrigated wetland was 7.073 (SE
=

0.170) and the mean pH of the natura] wetland was

5.550 (SE = OJ 94). The pH of the natural wetland found in their sample area, Centre County, Pennsylvania (United States), is much lower than the pH of natural wetland and lakes found in Alberta. Also, other paratneters they examined, such as · nutrients, may have confounded their results. More research is needed to determine how populations of wood frogs change along a pH gradient in Alberta, since the average pH is much higher than in the wetland tnentioned in the study by Laposata and Dunson (2000). It n1ay be necessary to use mesocosms to conduct this isolated-variable study. Dissolved oxygen had a negative relationship with wood frog populations. ·This is most likely because the water bodies had a low mixing capacity. The tnajority of sites had no flowing water because they were obstructed in sotne form. Water bodies that have a slow 1nixing capacity have Jess oxygen than fast, running streams (Horne and Goldtnan, 1994: 117, 24 7). Temperature also affects the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. The lower the temperature, the more oxygen will dissolve in the water until the maximum saturation point is reached (Kalff, 2002: 226-228). · The amount of dissolved oxygen could be related to the degree of mixing; however, the temperature of the water may have confounded the results. Again, 1nesocosms could be used in order to control water and air temperature (Caquet et al. 1996). Between the sites during the \Vater sampling, the mean temperature of the water ranged from 7.15°C (SE
=

0.31} to

19.03°C (SE = 0.58). Based on this study, it is difi1cult to suggest that the an1ount of dissolved oxygen directly impacts wood trog amphibian populations.

85

\Vood frogs have very short breeding periods, so the amount of dissolved oxygen may not significantly affect reproduction and larvae growth. Wood frogs are mostly terrestrial organisms; other than breeding and larvae development, they do not need to spend a significant amount of time under water; therefore, they may not rely on a high amount of dissolved oxygen to survive (Campbell et al. 2004). More research is needed to better quantify the relationship between dissolved oxygen and wood frog populations during the breeding season. Like pH, the use of n1esocosms · may be necessary to

successfully look at this relationship. The boreal chorus frog only had a significant relationship with dissolved oxygen and water temperature. The boreal chorus frog may have a negative relationship with dissolved oxygen for the same reason as the wood fi·og: a short use of the water for breeding and ovipositing (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, 2001: 28-29). Most of the water bodies had no flowing water, so the dissolved oxygen should be in a low amount (Horne and Goldman, 1994: 117, 247). Duting the sample study, the mean dissolved oxygen of the sites was 6.9 pp1n (SE = 0.3) and the mean dissolved oxygen ranged between 0.990 pptn (SE = 0.387) to 11.540 ppm {SE
=

1.470).

The tolerance of the wood frog to low oxygen levels is not known

(Laposata and Dunson, 2000). The minimum dissolved oxygen level to keep a lake healthy is 5 ppm. If the dissolved oxygen level is between 2 pptn and 5 ppm, most species of fish are stressed. If the dissolved oxygen level is below 2 ppm, then mortality of fish occurs (Big Lake Environment Support Society, 2006: 3). Five sites had mean dissolved oxygen levels below 5 ppm, but how closely the wood frog's tolerance is sin1ilar to a fish's tolerance is not known. Also, boreal chorus fi·ogs have a short

86

breeding period and because boreal chorus frogs do not need to be in the water all year round, they may have adapted to aquatic environments with low amounts of dissolved oxygen.
It is unclear why water tetnperature has a significant correlation with boreal

chorus frog populations. Water temperature may affect the behavior of boreal chorus frog calling males. The optitnum water ten1perature for northern leopard frog calling males is l 0° C (Kendell, 2002b: 16), but the source does not explain if this optimum ten1perature is a behavior limitation or a physiological lin1itation. There was no One

signitlcant correlation between water temperature and wood frog populations.

possible reason for this result is that the wood frog can adapt well to cold temperatures, since it is found n1ore north than any other amphibian (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, 2001: 35-36). There was no significant relationship between air temperature and wood frog and boreal chorus fi·og populations. The temperature of the ambient environment impacts the temperature of the water; therefore, a .large range in air and water temperature would make it hard to suggest that either one of these variables has a direct impact on the population dynamics of either frog

that was studied.
There is also a very little amount of research that looks at the relationship between water chen1istry and boreal chorus fi·og populations. Muths et al. (2003) found that boreal chorus frogs had no significant relationship with water chemistry. It seems that the boreal chorus frog is highly adapted to broad range of water chemistry parameters. Other amphibians have been found to adapt to aquatic environtnents with a broad range

87

of water chemistry parameters; the green and golden bell frog (Lito ria aurea) in Australia is an example (Hamer et aL 2002). 6:6 Pond Isolation In this study, the wood frog did not have a significant positive relationship with neighbouring vvetlands (0.346, p
=

0.072), and, it did not have a significant relationship

with the average distance to the closest ten ponds. Other studies have found different results. Baldwin (2005) found that wood frogs have a negative relationship with wetland proxi1nity; however, he determined that the wood frog's relationship was n1ost likely irrelevant, since there was a high mean amount of wetlands within 500 m of the breeding pools. The mean number of wetlands within 500 m was 9.2, and there was a mean of :11.5 wetlands within 4.5 km2 for this study. The high number of wetlands in this study also supports this suggestion. There are different methods to research pond isolation: mark-recapture (Cushman, 2006) and gene pool analysis (Olson et al. 2007). There are also methods to prevent pond isolation. Cunninghan1 et al. (2007) found that an increase in pond isolation could have a negative impact on wood frog breeding sites. They found that an indirect method to tninimize pond isolation is through the management of beaver dams. The creation of beaver dams can create a wetland n1osaic for amphibians. Instead of measuring the number of wetlands \vithin a 1.2-km radius or the average distance of to the closest ten ponds, it may be better to compare the mnount of wetland area within a 1.2-km radius. It may also be better to measure the perimeter of the wetlands instead of the area. By changing the parameter to measure, it may change the result of an analysis. The question of whether the species is itnpacted by pond

measure the perimeter and total wetland area. within a l.2. .km radius instead of using topographic n1aps and aerial . photographs; however, this was not done, since the measurement of the distance betweertthe nearest ponds was thought to be adequate for this study. As more research is conducted within the area, a larger data set can be

developed that could be used for GIS analysis (Chang, 2002: 2-5). The relationship in this study > betwe{tn wood frog presence and neighbouring wetland suggests that wood frogs. are grouped together in metapopulations within the sample area, but more research is needed to better quantify how wood frogs are organized into metapopulations. Petranka and tlolbrook (2006).found no significant results that support that wood frogs are organized into metapopulations at a local level; they suggest that wood frogs need to be investigated
~t a

landscape or regional level to determine if

they are organized into metapopulations {Petranka and Holbrook, 2006). The problem with trying to support .the .metapopulationth¢oryforaparticular amphibian species based on fieldwork is that it can be quite
expensiv~

because it is hard to have enough data for a

landscape-level study (Cushn1an, 2006).

.A.lso, ifl order to strongly support that a

particular amphibian species follows the n1etapopulation theory, genetic results comparing genetic variability between populations are needed besides pond isolation measurements (Olson et al. The boreal chorus with the number of

that have looked at the

frog. A 1.2-knl n1igrating

distance was assutned, since the boreal chorus frog shares its habitat with the wood frog. The migrating distance of the boreal chorus frog can be detem1ined in the future by using radio telemetry (Rittenhouse and Semlitsch, 2006). But1on (2001) found that boreal chorus frogs had a negative relationship with the average distance to the closest ponds. He suggested that the result was because boreal chorus frogs use ponds just for breeding purposes and spend the rest of their time in the sunounding ten·esbial environtnent. \Vood fi·ogs also spend most of their time in their terrestrial habitat, but they may have a stronger metapopulation organization than the boreal chorus frog. Since boreal chorus frogs may only use ponds for the breeding

season and because they are capable of migrating, it is more likely for a boreal chorus frog to be found in an isolated pond during the breeding season. Boreal chorus frogs n1ay rely more on the hydroperiod of a wetland, so they may breed in more isolated wetlands if there are few surrounding wetlands that have suitable hydroperiods (Baldvvin, 2005). There are some studies that have found strong correlations with the connectivity of ponds and frog presence (Lauck et al. 2005; Matthews et al. 2001). The

metapopulation theory, the mechanisms behind the metapopulation theory, and how strongly the n1etapopulation theory applies for many an1phibian species is not well known (Marsh and Trenham, 2001 ). Boreal chorus frogs may be organized into very weak

metapopulations, but as more long-term, landscape-level research is conducted comparing pond isolation data as wen as genetic data, a better understanding can be developed.

6:7 Road Density Surprisingly, the wood frog had a significant positive relationship Virith total road density. Based on available literature, it was expected that wood fi·ogs would have a negative relationship with road density (Rubbo and Kiesecker, 2005; Egan and Paton, 2004; Findlay et aL 200 I). It has been found that roads interfering with frog habitats can negatively ilnpact populations directly by road kills or indirectly by reducing available habitat, increasing frag1nentation between · neighbouring populations, and increasing the risk of extinction for individual populations. Hels and Buchwald (200 1) have even

developed a method to quantify the impact of road kills on amphibian populations based on the intensity of traffic. Research on the impact on roads of wood frogs is also

controversial, since Petranka et al. (2003b) have found no significant relationship with wood frog populations and road density. So far, there is no other study that has found a positive relationship with road density. One hypothesis for this result is the small amount of road within the sample area. For total road density, the mean density was 3983 m or road within 1200 m of the wetland (SE = 369 m), the maximum density was 8280 m of road within 1200 n1 of the wetland, and there were only seven sites that were above 5000 m of road within 1200 m of the wetland. Looking at the suitability index of road density for the wood frog

preliminary habitat suitability index model, twenty-one sites meet the ideal condition and have a suitability index value of 1. The other seven sites have a suitability index value between 0.8 and 1. There were no sites that had a
high~enough

road density to have a

low suitability index value. The sn1all amount of road n1ay have atTected the correlation coefficient and its significance value. If there were more .sites that had a suitability index

91

value below 0.8 or even belo\v 0.5, the correlation between the wood frog populations and road density within the sample area may change. Another hypothesis for this result is multicollinearity bet\veen another variable. If road density has a strong positive or negative correlation with another independent variable, then the two variables are not mutually exclusive and there is a high level of confounding (Burton, 2001 ). Genet (2004) compared species presence to road density in southern Michigan (United States). Genet (2004) n1easured the total road length within a
1000-m radius of each site and correlated the result with species presence. Genet (2004)

discovered that there was a positive relationship between wood frog presence and road density, but there was a negative relationship between wood frog presence and the amount of urban area. Genet (2004) also discovered that there was a negative

relationship between road density and spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) and Western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata) presence. There is the possibility that there was a high correlation between urban area and road density causing the inconsistency between the species. Houlahan (2002) compared species richness with various landscape

variables in southeastern Ontario. During his initial bivariate linear regression analysis, he discovered a negative relationship between species richness and road density and be discovered a positive relationship between species richness and forest cover. He also discovered a strong negative correlation the two independent variables. Since torest

cover had the strongest bivariate relationship among the landscape variables, he conducted a n1ulti-regression analysis with forest cover. During his tnulti-regression

analysis with forest cover, road density did not have a significant relationship with species richness. He suggested that because of the strong negative correlation between

92

forest cover and road density, there is confounding between the two variables which resulted in road density having no significant relationship .in . the multi-regression analysis. He also suggested if road density was looked at differently, such as tneasuring traffic volume instead of road length, there may have been different statistical results. The other possible hypothesis for this result is statistical error; it is possible the cotTelation between total road density and 'Wood frog population is a statistical anomaly.
It may be that the coefficient and its significance value is a result of ~hance, since paved

road density and unpaved road density had no significant correlation. The range of road density in this study shows that the sample area is a rural community and not an urban or sub-urban community. Hels and Buchwald (2001) found that amphibians are negatively impacted by road density, but their study site had a traffic intensity of 3200 vehicles/24h.
It is most unlikely that this sample area, a rural

comtnunity dominated by gravel roads, will have a traffic intensity that comes close to this value. As urban developtnent . continues in the area, road density 1nay eventually have a significant negative relation with wood frog populations. The boreal chorus frog had no significant relationship with road density. There are studies that have also found no significant relationship with road density and their amphibian species of interest (Pellet and Schmidt, 2005; Campbell et aL 2004; Petranka et al. 2003b). A possible explanation for this result is the stnaH amount of road. Using the suitability index of road density for the prelin1inary ·wood frog habitat suitability index model, there were no sites that had road density n1easurements high enough to receive a suitability index value below 0.8. Another possible explanation for this result is that the boreal chorus frog has very broad habitat needs. It has one of the greatest ranges,

93

co1npared to other amphibians, and is known to adapt to every environment in Alberta other than extretne alpine environments (Alberta Conservation Association and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, 2001: 28-29). Road density could still have a negative relationship with these two amphibian species. Road construction and road traffic is a means of habitat destruction and It is possible that roads are simply a surrogate of

fragmentation (Cushman, 2006).

urbanization and habitat loss; the amount of roads in an area most likely has a positive linear relationship with the amount of urban developtnent It may be better to combine the nun1ber of roads with the amount of urban development in the area and see if this combination impacts amphibian populations. Research is still needed to determine if

roads have an affect on amphibian populations. If road density does have a relationship \Vith mnphibian populations, then the mechanisms behind the process needs to be determined (Timm et al. 2007). More research that involves more sample sites and longterm rnonitoring should help determine potential significant contributions of roads on amphibian populations.

Chapter 7: Modifications of the Habitat Suitability Index Models

7:1 Introduction New models were developed as part of the n1odel verification process for the creation. of a habitat suitability index (HSI) model by analyzing the habitat variable relationships with field data (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-52). Results from the field data lead to son1e habitat variable relationships that were contradictory to the relationships in the literature review, so the n1odels were modified to reflect the field data results.. These modified models will still have to be verified by having a species

authority review the models or testing thetn with field data collected within the sample area (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-52). 7:2 Wood Frog Habitat Suitability Index Model Based on the field data, the wood frog has three key habitat variables for the HSI 1nodel. The first two habitat variables are fish presence and standing water and have the same suitability indexes as the indexes shown for the preliminary HSI model based on literature for the wood frog. The third variable is dominant vegetation. The suitability index is different than the preliminary suitability index for the boreal chorus frog; a site that is dominant with no vegetation receives a suitability index value of 0 (Figure 12). The suitability index is different because no frogs were found at sites that were classified with having no vegetation. A suitability index could not be developed for conductivity. When comparing the mean conductivity and the ranks from the calling surveys, no distinctive pattern could be determined (Figure 13 ). It is possible to combine ranks to get a more general pattern,

95

such as averaging the means of ranks 5 and 4 and averaging the means of ranks 3, 2, and
1; however, this \vould lead to the suitability index being very subjective.

A suitability index also could not be developed for dissolved oxygen, since no distinctive patten1 could be determined when comparing mean dissolved oxygen and rank (Figures 14). Again, it is possible to co1nbine ranks, such as averaging the means

between selected ranks, but the suitability index would be very subjective. The pH was also not put into the new model because the pH varied too much among the ranks (Figure 15). The n1ean pH range between the sites was only 1.961; the mean minitnum pH was 6.757 (SE = 0.084); the LCso for wood frog larvae is 4.12 (Sadinski and Dunson, 1992).

Taking the three variables, a final HSI model is developed:
HSI Wood Frog- (V F * V S

* V V) 113

[4]

VF= Fish Presence Vs =Standing Water V v = Dominant Vegetation The model shows a compensatory relationship where the .relationship is controlled by a geometric mean. The geon1etric mean considers the lowest suitability index value. If one of the variables has a suitability index value of 0, then the habitat suitability index is 0. Even though the model is quite general and approximate, it should reflect the particular geographic area and can becon1e n1ore precise as more research on wood frog habitat is conducted within the sample area (Division of Ecological Services, 1981: 3-1 - 3-54). All three habitat variables in the model are non-parmnetric, categorical data. The problem with non-parametric data is that they are less precise than parmnetric data and it is 1nore difficult to find significant trends in a non-parmnetric test. Non-parametric data are difficult to work with because it is difficult to predict the distribution around the mean for a data set; therefore, it takes many parameters to describe the distribution, unlike 98

parametric data (Gould and Gould, 2002: 16, 139-140). The dominant vegetation habitat variable is based on categorical data and the fish and standing water habitat variables are based on binary data. Both these types of data consist of less information than discrete or continuous data, which are types of parametric data (Zar, 1974: 4, 109). For scientists and conservation n1anagers, it may be difficult to make decisions based on a n1odel that does not require avast amount of infotmation. A conservation tnanager may not want to 1nake a difficult conservation decision based on a model that requires data of low complexity and that produces an output of estimation; however, this model may be a more efficient, cost-effective method, since tests and models that use non~parametric data are usually n1ore simple to conduct and easier to calculate (Pagano and Gauvreau, 2000: 312). This tnodel is the original model and should produce an acceptable output that is suitable to act as a guide for conservation managers.
It is also acceptable that the

acceptable 1nodel output is not equal to the ideal output of 1 at this stage of the model development (Gould and Gould, 2002: 16, 139-140). Compared to the HSI model that was based on available literature, hydroperiod was not included, since hydroperiod was not determined for the sample sites. It is possible to have don1inant vegetation represent hydroperiod. Egan and Paton (2004)

found that woody vegetation and persistent emergent vegetation is more likely to be found in wetlands with seasonal/temporary hydroperiods and aquatic vegetation is n1ore
likely to be found in wetland vvith pennanent hydroperiods. Seasonal hydroperiods aHow

for emergent vegetation to germinate during water draw-downs (Henning and Schirato, 2006). The hydroperiod suitability index can still be integrated into the HSI 1nodel for this geographic area in future conservation efforts; however, it may be necessary to

99

coni:lrm that hydroperiod does in fact hnpact wood frog populations found in this sample area. Road density was also not included, since the range of road density was not large enough to have a strong cotnparison. Road density could be used as a habitat variable; however, it would only reflect a rural area with very light road traffic. If future urban developments occur within the sample area and change the area into a sub-urban or urban area, then the preliminary road density suitability index can not be used. Fish presence and water movement are the strongest habitat variables in the tnodel. Conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH have an effect on wood frog presence, but no non-subjective suitability index could be developed for them and their relationship between wood frog and boreal chorus frog populations are definitely not as powerful or have a strong effect con1pared to fish presence and water 1noven1ent. 7:3 Boreal Chorus Frog Habitat Suitability Index Model For the boreal chorus frog, there are only three key habitat variables for the HSI modeL The i:lrst three habitat variables are tish presence, water movement, and dominant vegetation. Fish presence and water movement have the same suitability indexes as the suitability indexes in the preliminary model that was based on available literature. For dominant vegetation, the suitability index is the same as suitability index of the wood frog (Figure 12). A suitability index could not be developed for dissolved oxygen. When

comparing mean dissolved oxygen and rank, no distinctive pattern could be detetmined (Figure 16). It is possible to combine the ranks, such as averaging the mean dissolved oxygen value between selected ranks, but the suitability index would be very subjective.

A HSI model has been developed by taking into consideration the three habitat variables:
HSlBoreal Chorus Frog=

(V F * V S * V V )

113

[5]

VF= Fish Presence V s = Standing Water V v = Dominant Vegetation The HSI model shows a compensatory relationship using a geometric mean; the lowest

suitability index n1odel is taken into consideration. If one of the suitability index values
is 0, then the habitat suitability index is 0. The model can be modified as more research on boreal chorus frog habitat is conducted (Division of Ecological Services, 1981 : 3-1 ·3-54). Since there is very little research on boreal chorus frog habitat, the model should most likely yield a very approximate output for the smnple area (Nussbaum et al. 1983: 143); however, this is the original 1nodel for the species in the selected geographic area and is the first known HSI model for the particular species. Key habitat variables have been indentified for the boreal chorus frog, and as more research is conducted in the area,
101

an acceptable output can be achieved that can be used to make conservation management decisions. Like the wood frog model, aU three habitat variables in the 1nodel are nonparametric, categorical data. The problem \Vith non¢parametric data is that they are less reliable than parametric data and harder to find significant trends in a non-parametric test.
It is easier to reject a null hypothesis with a non-parametric test than with one that is

parametric; however, it is easier to have a Type II error (have a significant output when you are not supposed to have a significant error) with a non-parmnetric test (Pagano and Gauvreau, 2000: 312). Quantitative comparisons can not be made among a nonparatnetric data set, so less information is conveyed in a data set used for this model (Zar, 1974: 4); therefore, there is a higher chance of error when a scientist or n1anager makes an important conservation decision. This model is the originaltnodel, it is sufficient that the acceptable model output is not equal to the ideal output of 1 (Gould and Gould, 2002:
16~

139-140).
For the boreal chorus frog HSI model, pond isolation was not included, since

there were no significant relationships between the boreal chorus frog and pond isolation. More research is needed to determine if boreal chorus frogs are organized into metapopulations and how strongly metapopulation 1nechanisms affect boreal chorus frog population dynatnics. Pond fragmentation along with gene pool studies can be conducted to determine if the boreal chorus frog supports the metapopulation theory (Olson et aL 2007).

Chapter 8: Recommendations for Future Research
8:1 Introduction In order to tnake the models more sensitive, further research is needed. There needs to more research that focuses on the habitat ecology of the wood frog and · the boreal chorus frog; especially ·within the geographic area that the models represent. More research will allow more information to be considered for further development · and verification of the models. Based on this study, certain topics have been selected that require more research for further development of the n1odels; required studies and ways on how to conduct them have been suggested. 8:2 UsingMesocosms for Future Fish and Water QuaHtyStudies More research is needed to study

The

if fish cause a complete

crash in the amphibian population and whether some amphibians still remain in the Inesocosm. By using tnesocosms, the type of fish species used in the study can also be controlled to see if non-indigenous fish have a greater negative impact than indigenous fish on the amphibian populations. There is no known research that has looked at the difference between fish population dynamics and wood frog or boreal chorus fi·og population dynamics. It is difficult to suggest that every site that has fish present will never be able to support wood frogs. Mesocostns could be used to look at the difference between fish populations on the wood trog. Tanks could be used each containing a different number of ·fish to

determine if there is a difference in the negative impact on wood frog or boreal chorus frog populations. The impact of the water quality parameters that were looked at in this study can also be looked at using mesocosms. The artificial water used in the man-made holes or tanks can be manipulated to represent conditions that are similar to the conditions of the sites found within the area or to represent conditions that have been selected by the researcher (Home and Dunson, 1995). The pH can be controlled to represent the

conditions that have a sub-lethal effect on the amphibian species, since the range of the pH in this study does not tneet the sub-lethal pH level for the wood frog (Sadinski and Dunson, 1992). Dissolved oxygen can be controlled by controlling the temperature of the water and air, and the conductivity can be controlled by controlling the amount of solute that enters the mesocosm (Kalff, 2002: 226-228; Wetzel and Likens, 2000: l 00).

104

8:3 Forest Cover and Vegetation The tvvo HSI models only represent the breeding season for the two species. Both frogs use the terrestrial environment for foraging and hibernation (Regosin et aL 2003). The terrestrial environment and its characteristics must be taken into consideration in order to produce a HSI model that represents the entire life cycle of each species. Unfortunately, there is lack of sufficient research for the wood frog and barely any research for the boreal chorus frog that looks at terrestrial habitat characteristics. There is very little research that has looked at wood frogs or boreal chorus frogs success in grasslands and open areas, since wood fi·ogs have been found in these ecosystems (Rittenhouse and Semlitsch, 2007; Vasconcelos and Calhoun, 2006). Only one study has looked at the in1pact of grassland vegetation on wood frog population dynamics. Eaves (2004) looked at the impact of land use in the Aspen Parkland Natural Sub-region on the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog. She cmnpared four land uses (pasture, crop, natural, and residential) on wood frog and boreal chorus frog population dynamics and found that both of the species had the greatest abundance at sites where the primary land use was natural; however, she did not look at other terrestrial variables, such as the amount of land use area within each of the species migratory distances, the amount of each land use on the perimeter of each site, and the distance to each land use. If a suitability index was developed using Eaves' variables, the suitability index would require ordinal data. The three habitat variables that could have also been looked at \Vould allow a suitability index that would require more sensitive, parametric data. Research needs to be done in the geographic area to determine how vegetation cover surrounding wetland that is not classified as forest affects wood frog or boreal

105

chotllS frog population dynan1ics.

The amount of area of each vegetation type; the

distance to each vegetation type; the amount of area of each vegetation type within the migratory distances of each species; and the status of each vegetation type, such as the grassland being dominated by invasive species are some of the habitat variables that need to be looked at. It 1nay be useful to use GIS to determine the amount of vegetation types that are part of the terrestrial environment that make up the habitat for the satnple species (Guerry and Hunter Jr., 2002). $:4 Conclusion After further verification, these models can be used to determine the baseline and future quality and quantity of habitat during the breeding season in ·the Foothills Parkland Natural Sub-region and Bow River Sub-basin for the wood frog and the boreal chorus frog. These models can be used to predict how future changes within this

geographic area can change the quality and quantity of habitat for each amphibian species. They can also be used as a guide when n1anagers and scientists want to restore or create wetland to support wood frog or boreal chorus frog populations within the sample area by considering the ideal suitability index values of each variable. These models are at the stage where they can be used to detem1ine future investigations of habitat-variable relationships with the wood frog and boreal chorus frog within the sample area. More research on these two species within the sample area can help enhance and ·revise the models so they can be used to tnake accurate conservation management decisions (Jones et al. 2002). There is very Jittle research that has examined the habitat characteristics of each species and this study helps point out what additional

106

investigations are needed to help improve conservation efTorts and keep populations of both species sustainable for the future.
