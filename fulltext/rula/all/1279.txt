ABSTRACT
Several electricity markets were created in the last two decades by deregulation and restructuring vertically integrated utilities. In order to serve the best interest of participating entities, it is important to operate electricity markets at their maximum efficiency. In most cases, electricity markets were formed to operate on existing physical power systems that had evolved over several decades as vertically integrated utilities. Location of generating stations, large urban load centers and enabling transmission systems were unique to every power system and followed the `lay of the land'. Depending upon a power system layout, voltage stability and margin to voltage collapse are unique to it. While an electricity market is to be operated efficiently, its optimal generation schedule to supply energy through an electric power system has to be reliable and meet the strict standards including those that relate to voltage stability. This work elicits the relationship between market efficiency and voltage stability. To this end, a formulation and a solution algorithm are presented. Two contrasting 5-bus cases illustrate how the transmission system layout influences the relationship between voltage stability and market efficiency. The IEEE 118-bus system is also used to illustrate this relationship.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION
Power systems have evolved over several decades and their evolution is unique to every state/province/country. This development follows the `lay of the land', availability of resources and space to build power stations, development of cities and other load centers, right of way to build transmission lines and such other constraints. Based upon these details, a power system has a level of voltage stability [1] and margin to voltage collapse. The system voltage stability and margin to voltage collapse are parameters that are tightly controlled and specified by the regulatory body with jurisdiction in that area. One example of such a regulatory body is the North Eastern Power Coordinating Council that oversees the province of Ontario, Canada. Many studies [2-7] have been done in order to include the voltage stability maximization objective in the OPF (Optimal Power Flow). Ref. [8] examines questions of stability in interconnected power systems coupled with Market Dynamics. In other papers [9-10], the cost minimization objective and Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) in the Power Market were discussed. In 1990's, through deregulation of the business of electric power systems and restructuring of monolithic utilities, competing components were created and new ones were built that compete to sell and buy electric energy in the electricity market. Every jurisdiction has its own market and a market clearing mechanism. Efficiency of the market is the cornerstone of an electricity market. Market efficiency is directly tied to the ability of generators and loads to freely buy and sell energy across the transmission system. Congestion in transmission lines

Chapter 1 Introduction
 

causes evident impediments in market efficiency [11-12]. The requirement to maintain a certain margin to voltage collapse also restricts dispatch of generators in certain situations and consequently may reduce market efficiency. This thesis explores the relationship between market efficiency and MW Margin to Voltage Collapse. In order to enable such a study, a single ended auction market is considered with generators bidding to sell energy. A formulation that minimizes generation costs and maximizes MW Margin to Voltage Collapse (or voltage stability margin) is presented. The formulation is constrained by regular constraints that limit generators and other devices to their physical limits and power balance equations of the AC transmission system. This thesis considers two contrasting cases of a 5-bus system. The first one negatively correlates the two objectives while the second case positively correlates the two objectives. reported. Chapter 2 provides a theoretical foundation for this work. It introduces basic definitions of the electricity market and the associated energy auction process. Chapter 3 presents the proposed nonlinear mixed integer programming formulation to settle an electricity market. This model is linearized to form an incremental model. As the incremental MILP model has two objectives, it is transformed into a fuzzy MILP model and solved successively to reach the optimal solution. A Full description of the solution method is given at the end of the Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents results of tests on two contrasting cases of a 5-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system. The values of MW Margin to Voltage Collapse before and after the Optimization are provided as a measure of Voltage Stability besides the A similar exercise on the IEEE 118-bus system is completed and

In Chapter 5, conclusions derived from the study and test results are listed. Finally, in the Appendices, the data for the two 5-bus systems and the modified IEEE 118-bus system that were studied in this work are provided.

CHAPTER 2

THEORY
This chapter introduces basic theoretical foundation for this work. In this chapter, we choose to use the definitions of market efficiency and voltage stability as given in [12] and [1] respectively. For the work described in this chapter, we choose to use a single ended auction model for simplicity. We wish to stress that this work would apply equally to a double-ended auction model as well. For the purpose of illustration, we chose a 3-bus system with two generator busses and one load bus. 2.1 3-Bus System The 3-bus system is shown in Figure 1. The line from bus 1 to bus 3 is long and the line from bus 2 to bus 3 is short. The generator 1 (at bus 1) is selling energy at a low price and generator 2 (at bus 2) is selling energy at a higher price. Tables 1 and 2 give the data for this system. 2.1.1 Voltage Stability

Treating bus 1 as the slack bus, the linearized power balance equations appear to be:  

 P2   J122  P  =  J1  3   32  J332   Q3

The submatrices [J1], [J2], [J3] and [J4] form the system Jacobian [J]. Decomposing the Jacobian matrix [J] using singular values decomposition: [J] = [SL] [] [SR]t (3)

It has been illustrated in several works before that the minimum singular value of the load flow Jacobian will have a higher value at a higher voltage stable state [1, 7 and 16]. As mentioned before, the MW Margin to Voltage Collapse is the amount of load that the system can supply before it encounters voltage collapse. It would act as an additional indicator or measure of Voltage Stability Margin together with the minimum singular value. The MW Margin to Voltage Collapse is easily calculated in a few steps. Consider a base value of generations and loads at all the buses. The power balance equations are solved for this set of base values of generations and loads. Then, loads and generations are multiplied by a factor K and the power balance equations are resolved. The value of the factor K is gradually increased in small steps from unity until a solution for the power balance equations does not exist. The highest value of K that has a solution for the power balance equations is recorded. The MW Margin to Voltage Collapse equals: Total Base Case System Load x (K-1).

Electricity Market

In a typical Double Auction Electricity Market, the Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the Auction Process as shown in Figure 2. The ISO receives the supply offers from the Generators and the buying bids from the Loads or Consumers. It stacks the supply offers from the lowest priced offers in an ascending order up to the highest and the purchase bids from the highest bid in a descending order down to the lowest to construct the supply and demand schedules. The point of intersection of the two schedules is called the Competitive Market Clearing (CMC) Point as shown in Figure 3. The quantity units lying to the left of the CMC point are called inframarginal units, while all other units are called extramarginal units. All inframarginal suppliers are paid the same market clearing price and all inframarginal buyers pay the same market clearing price. The net seller surplus is the area between the horizontal line at the CMC price level and the supply schedule while the net buyer surplus is the area between the same horizontal line and the demand schedule. The sum of the seller and buyer surpluses yields the Total Net Seller Buyer Surplus (TNSBS). The efficiency of the market (M.E) can be calculated using the following formula:
. 100%

M.E will be 100 % if all inframarginal units trade and no extramarginal units trade. In case of a single Auction Electricity Market ­which is the case in Ontario, Canada-, the consumers do not make purchase bids. Only Generators make supply offers to the ISO. The ISO forecasts the energy needed and settles the market as shown in Figure 4. Since there is no buyer surplus, TNSBS will be equal to the net seller surplus.

2.2 Analysis

The 3-bus system, as can be seen from the data, is a lossless system. By virtue of being a lossless system without congestion, the price of real power is the same at all the busses of the system. The auction diagram may be created by stacking the sell bids in their increasing order as shown in Figure 5 as `case 1'. As this is a single ended auction market, the demand is a vertical line at the total system demand of 250 MW. In case 1, one may see that generator 1's segments 1, 2 and 3 are dispatched to deliver 100 MW, 100 MW and 50 MW each respectively and the total generation cost to the system equals $ 9,500. The competitive market clearing (CMC) point is at $ 50 / MWh. The net seller surplus equals $ 3,000 and the market efficiency equals 100%. Segments 1, 2 and 3 of generator 1 are infra-marginal units. Segments 1, 2 and 3 of generator 2 are extramarginal units. The minimum singular value equals 0.9393 and the Load Margin before Voltage Collapse equals 39.75 MW. Thereafter, in order to bring generation closer to the load, segments of generator 1 (infra-marginal units) are closed one at a time starting with segment 3, then 2 and finally 1. These yield cases 2, 3 and 4 as shown in Figure 5. In each case, a higher priced segments from generator 2 (extra-marginal units) are dispatched and the marginal price increases to $ 70/ MWh, $ 80 / MWh and $ 90 / MWh respectively. The seller surplus progressively decreases in each case and market efficiency decreases as tabulated in Table 3. Of interest is that when the generation moves from generator 1 to 2, the source of generation moves closer to the load and system Jacobian's minimum singular value as well as the MW Margin to Voltage Collapse increase. It brings the system to a better voltage stable state.

From the above, three important aspects can be surmised and they are listed below:
Inference #1: As we move generation from cheaper to expensive units, extra-marginal

units are committed. Consequently, the market surplus and market efficiency reduces.
Inference #2: As we move generation from generator away from load to those that are

close to loads, minimum singular value of the system Jacobian and MW Margin to Voltage Collapse increases and the system becomes more voltage stable.
Inference #3: If more expensive generators are located close to load centers, a higher

voltage stable state means more expensive generators are dispatched, a higher marginal price and a less efficient market. While these inferences are true only for this 3-bus system, these may also be observed in general for larger systems as well. In larger systems, lesser-priced large coal / nuclear power plants are situated far away from large urban load centers and expensively priced smaller peak-load generators are located closer to them. Therefore, in order to develop a tool to determine the influence of voltage stability margin on market efficiency for larger systems, we propose a formulation and solution scheme in the next Chapter.

CHAPTER 3

FORMULATION
This Chapter presents a formulation to settle an electricity market. The formulation considers two objectives. The first objective considers bids by generations and minimizes the net costs to clear the market. The second objective maximizes the MW Margin to Voltage Collapse (or the minimum singular value of the system's Jacobian). The two objectives are constrained by power balance equations and limits on generators real power outputs, generators reactive power outputs, generator voltage magnitudes, capacitor outputs and load bus voltage magnitudes. As the constraining equations and objectives are nonlinear and have integer variables, the complete formulation presented below is a nonlinear mixed integer formulation with multiple objectives. Thereafter, this formulation is linearized to develop an incremental model that is of a mixed integer linear programming nature and multiple objectives. This formulation is solved using fuzzy optimization technique to handle the multiple objectives. This fuzzy optimization model and solution algorithm also presented in the last section of this Chapter.
3.1 Complete Nonlinear Mixed Integer Optimization Formulation

This section presents the complete formulation for settling an electricity market. It considers price bids from generators for real and reactive power and price bids for reactive power capacitors. It also relates real and reactive power generation limits using a linear approximation of the generator capability chart.
3.1.1 Generator Model

The generator model has three parts. They include a) c) model of reactive power price, b) model of real power price, and, model of capability constraint that relates max output of real and reactive powers.

3.1.1.1 Economic Model of Reactive Power Generation

The diagram as shown in Fig. 3 (upper part) models a generator's reactive power cost curve accounting for its own losses due to additional reactive power output and lost opportunity cost. It has five segments with segments 1 and 2 in the negative (leading) side and segments 3, 4 and 5 on the positive side (lagging). Considering UGi (a binary integer) to model the status of participation of the generator in the reactive power market, each segment has an output, QGin where indices i, n refer to the ith generator's nth segment. QG in and QG in refer to minimum and maximum generation by the nth segment. For segments 1 and 2, minimums would be a negative value with a zero maximum. Segments 3, 4 and 5 will have a positive maximum with zero minimums. One may write up limits on the generator and each segment as below:

UG i .QG i   QG in  UG i .QG i
n =1

NM

(4) (5)

QG in  QG in  QG in

In (5), segments 1 and 2 have QGin which will assume only negative values and hence QG in will have negative values and QG in will be zeros. For segments 3, 4 and 5, have QGin that will assume only positive values and hence QG in will be zeros and QG in will be positive values. With ei and fin being fixed and incremental, the total system cost to procure reactive power from generators equals:
NG 5  QGCost =   UGi .ei +  f in .QGin  i = 1 n =1 

(6)

18   

Chapter 3 Formulation  

3.1.1.2 Economic Model of Real Power Generation

The cost of active power consists of a fixed part and an incremental part. The total capability of a generator is divided in a number of segments. The cost of generation within each segment has an ascending fixed rate through all the segments. The total system cost to procure active power from generators equals:

PGCost =

NK   a . UG b ik .PG ik  +   i  i i =1  k =1  NG

(7)

The Limits on segments may be written as follows:

3.1.1.3 Relation Between Generator Real and Reactive Power Outputs

The diagram in the bottom of Fig. 3 depicts an approximate capability chart where line segments are used to approximate the actual diagram and generate linear relations. This diagram is used to derive limits on real power output in relation to reactive power output. When the generator is operating in segments 2 and 3, reactive power output does not restrict real power output. In segments 1, 4 and 5, reactive power output limits real power output. Hence, limits on real power output may be related to reactive power output in those segments (1, 4 and 5) using straight line relations where din represents slope of the graph segments.

Economic Model of Switchable Capacitors

Other reactive power sources may participate in the transmission network and provide strategic reactive power support. This might help the system to be more efficient with lesser losses and be more voltage stable. Their services are bundled into one model for simplicity and their remuneration is computed as below: QSCost =

Total Cost Minimization ­ First objective

In the above, PG, QS, UG, US and V (generators) are control variables and others are dependent variables. The variables QG, VL and  are dependent on the state of the system. It is assumed that optimal schedule is made available from the 24-hour unit commitment and short-term real power dispatch. It will form the starting point in this process. Hence, the first objective is to minimize the sum of equations 6, 7 and 10.

3.1.4

Voltage Stability Maximization ­ Second Objective

In order to maximize the MW Margin to Voltage Collapse, the minimum singular value of the load flow Jacobian is maximized. It must be stressed here that the value of minimum singular value does not provide the margin to voltage collapse. Alternatively, the MW margin to voltage collapse is determined by continuation power flow for a given load and generation pattern. Hence, the second is to maximize  (3) where  is the least singular value of the load flow Jacobian. From equation (3): [J] = [SL] [] [SR]t

With the left and right hand side singular vector matrices being orthogonal: [] = [SL]t [J] [SR] (13) We will refer to it in this chapter with  (, V) where it is a function of bus voltage phasor V as the Jacobian [J] is a function of the bus voltage phasor. Hence the second objective of this nonlinear mixed integer programming problem is: Maximize [(, V)] = [SL]t [J(, V)] [SR] (14)

3.1.5

Complete Model

Finally, using modeling of sources as outlined above, the nonlinear mixed integer programming challenge with two objectives of minimizing total market settlement cost and maximizing voltage stability margin is constructed and presented. The complete model will be as follows: Min the Total Costs (from equation 12):

Additionally optimization must ensure that vectors UG and US remain binary integers. As (17) ­ (18) are nonlinear equalities, this is nonlinear mixed integer optimization problem. Its solution is challenging. This formulation can be solved using several techniques. Special care must be taken while handling the multiple objectives. In this thesis, successive fuzzy MILP technique is used [13-14]. Depending upon the importance given to the objectives, they are accordingly optimized in the optimization process. The formulation is set up in the next sections and solved for three systems.

Incremental Model

Consider a starting point of X. Then, we might reformulate the problem (15) ­ (27) such that X + X gives the optimal solution. Considering a starting point, it is assumed that the values of the vector X= [UG PG US QS VG], are available. An incremental model of X+X is then set up in order to find the optimal incremental changes of X= [UG PG US QS VG] so that the total cost is minimized and the Voltage Stability is maximized.

Considering a change in the operating state from (V, ) to (V+V, +), one may write another form of (29) as below: [+ ] = [SL+SL]t [J+J] [SR+SR] (42)

Ignoring terms [SL] and [SR] and relating change in singular values () to change in Jacobian (J), one may write: [] = [SL]t [J] [SR] (43) Using the hessian of the power balance equations [H] one may write:
  [J] = [H]    V 

(44)

It may be pointed out that the hessian is a three dimensional matrix and is stored as a sparse matrix. Using (43) and (44), one can write change in singular values in terms of change in state of the system as an approximate linear relation as below:

   = [SL]t [H] [SR] V

Then by solving power balance equations, we determine values of QG, VL and . This process of setting up the MILP model, its solution, update of control variables and solution of power balance equations is grouped as a LPMOVE. LPMOVEs are repeated successively to determine optimal settings. In the following text, we transform the above formulation into a fuzzy formulation so that we combine the two objectives and provide a single objective optimization model.
3.3 Fuzzy Optimization Model

Since we have to two conflicting objectives that need to be optimized simultaneously, our problem became a multiobjective optimization problem. There are many methods to solve this multiobjective problem as constructing single aggregate objective function (AOF), Normal Boundary Intersection method (NBI), Normal
28   

Chapter 3 Formulation  

Constraint method (NC), Multiobjective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA)...etc. One of the methods that also can be used to solve the problem and which we choose to use in this thesis is the Fuzzy method. In 1965 a new logic based on Fuzzy sets was introduced by L.A.Zadeh [17]. He defined Fuzzy set as a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership. Such set is characterized by a membership function which assigns to each object a grade of membership between zero and one. Fuzzy method is computationally simple and very efficient. In order to optimize the formulation presented in the preceding section, the objectives of the multiobjective formulation are transformed to fuzzy sets. In a fuzzy optimization model, two satisfaction parameters for Total Cost (T) and Voltage stability (V) are created. The minimum of all satisfaction parameters () is maximized while observing other non-fuzzy constraints. Mathematically, this is achieved by forming fuzzy functions for each objective as below.
3.3.1 Fuzzy Model of Total Cost Min Objective

Let the following fuzzy set define the satisfaction of a solution X with respect to the incremental objective of cost minimization (41):

TC = ( T (X) , TC(X)) | TC < TC(X) < TC

{

}

(61)

The values of X are defined such that: TC < TC(X) < TC . This constraint limits the solution within a set of feasible values. The variable T is the satisfaction of the solution X with respect to the first objective. The satisfaction T can be defined as:
T = TC - TC(X) TC - TC

(62)

One can surmise from Fig. 4 that as TC moves from the maximum value ( TC ) to the minimum value ( TC ), the satisfaction increases from zero to one.

29

3.3.2

Fuzzy Model of Voltage Stability Margin Max Objective

Let the following fuzzy set define the satisfaction of a solution X with respect to the incremental objective of voltage stability margin maximization (46):
 = ( V ( X) , (X)) |  < (X) < 

{

}

(63)

The values of X are defined such that:  < (X) <  . The variable V is the satisfaction of the solution X with respect to the second objective. The satisfaction V can be defined as:

V =

(X) -   - 

(64)

One can surmise from Fig. 5 that as  moves from the minimum value (  ) to the maximum value (  ), the satisfaction increases from zero to one.
3.4 Complete Fuzzy Model

Let  be the intersection of fuzzy satisfaction functions of (62) and (64). The variable  is maximized to maximize the satisfaction of the two objectives. Setting  lesser than T and V, one gets the following relations from (62) and (64):
  TC = TC - TC( X) or (  TC -  TC ). +  TC(  X)   TC TC - TC

Solution Algorithm

The formulation (67)-(83) is written and programmed in MATLAB® using the optimization function "mosekopt", an optimization toolbox. The study results are discussed in the next chapter. The proposed solution algorithm has the following steps:
       Step 1: Load Flow analysis for the System is done with the initial values of X. Step 2: The constraint equations and limits are set using the values of X. Step 3: The optimization formulation (67)-(83) is solved to maximize  to

determine the optimal increments X.
Step 4: Update the values of the control variables of X with their optimal

increments in X (PG, QS, UG, US and V). X = X + X.
Step 5: Load Flow Analysis is done using the new values of X achieved from

Step 4.
Step 6: The values of Total Cost, MW Margin to Voltage Collapse and the

marginal price are calculated and recorded.
Step 7:Steps 2-6 are called an LPMOVE. They are repeated for a number of times

to get the optimal solution. Note: In case of the single objective solution (Only minimizing the cost), the constraint equation (69) (for maximizing the stability) is not included in Step 2.

CHAPTER 4

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In order to study the effect of the voltage stability margin on the market efficiency, the optimization problem is solved in two steps. 1. First, the fuzzy optimization problem is solved without considering the second objective (eq. 69) of maximizing the min singular value of the system Jacobian. This solution, which is called the single objective solution, yields the least cost generation dispatch solution. The results are recorded and the bidding curve is drawn. The CMC (Competitive Market Clearing) point, the net seller surplus and the market efficiency values are calculated accordingly. The net seller surplus in this point is maximum and the market efficiency is 100% (maximum efficiency). 2. Then, the formulation is solved considering both objectives of minimizing costs (68) and maximizing the min singular value of the Jacobian (voltage stability margin maximization) (69). The Net Seller Surplus and the Market Efficiency values for this solution, which is called the double objective solution, are then calculated and compared to the single objective solution. The above procedure was applied to two cases of the 5-bus test system (Figure 9) and a modified version of the IEEE 118-bus test system.
4.1 5-bus System

For the 5-bus test system, two cases are set up. In case #1, expensive generators are set close to bus 4 (system load centre), while in case #2 the inexpensive generators are set close to bus 4. Data for the system is given in the Appendices (Appendix B).

4.1.1 Case #1

Generator 1, which is connected to bus 1 (away from the load at bus 4), sells energy at a lesser price whereas Generator 2 connected to bus 5 (closer to the load at bus 4) sells energy at a higher price. Before optimizing, the two generators share the system load equally by supplying 200 MW each. This is the starting state. Following Step 1, the single objective solution is obtained minimizing the cost only. The cost decreases from $8,000 to $7,000 as the generation is optimally moved to the inexpensive generator 1 so that it now supplies 300 MW of the 400 MW load. The minimum singular value decreases from 4.1080 to 3.9135 as generator 1 (bus 1) is far away from load at bus 4 as compared to generator 2 (bus 5).  In addition, the MW Margin to Voltage Collapse drops from 212 MW to 168 MW. Thereafter, following step 2, the double objective solution moves generation to the expensive generator 2 (bus 5) so that it now supplies 300 MW and generator 1 at bus 1 supplies only 100 MW. It increases the cost to $10,000 and the minimum singular value increases from 4.1080 (Starting State) to 4.2162. The MW Margin to Voltage Collapse increased from 212 MW to 228 MW. These results can be seen in Figure 10. As a result of the configuration of the system, the objective of increasing the system voltage stability shifts most of the generation to the more expensive generator which is closer to the load in this case. These results are reflected on the bidding curves developed for the generators and shown in Figure 11. It is found that the market efficiency drops from 100% in single objective case to 50% (= A1 / [A1+A2]) in the double objective case. Summarizing, in Table 4, the optimal results of single and double objective optimization are presented. In this case, it is evident that as the voltage stability margin is maximized, the market efficiency reduces.

4.1.2 Case #2

In case #2, we reverse the price data of generators 1 and 2 so that generator 1 (away from load) is expensive and generator 2 (closer to the load) is inexpensive. The data for this system is given in the Appendix. After getting the single objective solution (minimizing the cost only) in Step 1, the cost decreases from $8,000 to $7,000 and the minimum singular value increases from 4.1080 to 4.2144. The MW Margin to Voltage Collapse increased from 212 MW to 252 MW. Following step 2, the double objective solution also increases the min singular value from the same point to 4.2144 and the MW Margin to Voltage Collapse from the same point to 252 MW while the cost decreases to $7,000. Hence, in this case #2, the two optimization solutions yield the same result. The results are shown in Figure 12. In case #2, the generator pricing aids the system's voltage stability. Hence, optimizing for the single objective (step 1) shifts generation to the inexpensive generator 2 (bus 5) which is closer to the load. Consequently, the voltage stability increases automatically. In step 2 of case #2, optimizing for double objectives yields the same result. Hence, the market efficiency remains at 100%. The bid curves for the single objective and double objective solutions are identical (they are identical to the single objective solution bid curve of case #1).

Chapter 4 Results and Discussions  

On surveying real power systems, one sees that usually, large coal fired plants and hydro generators are placed far away from large urban load centers. These power plants supply inexpensive electric energy. Small peaking plants tend to supply expensive electric energy and are situated closer to the loads. Hence, not as a rule, in the usual scenario case #1 is more likely in a real power system. Hence, while optimizing both objectives, where the second objective tries to maximize voltage stability, the market efficiency reduces.

4.2

118-bus System

We now consider the standard 118-bus IEEE system. It is modified by changing line resistance values to zero such that it becomes a lossless system. Data for the system is given in the Appendices Section (Appendix C). The results of optimization are given in Figure 13. On optimizing the system considering only the single objective of cost minimization, the optimum cost equals $79,451 with a min singular value of 0.1975 and a MW Margin to Voltage Collapse of 186.65 MW. In contrast, when the system is optimized for double objectives of cost minimization and voltage stability maximization, it has the optimum costs of $115,573, a min singular value of 0.2007 and a MW Margin to Voltage Collapse of 306.65 MW. From the results, one may clearly see that by optimizing the system in the double objective case, the generation moves towards the loads to increase min singular value and it costs more. Now, by looking at the bid curves (Figure 14), it can be seen that the marginal price is driven much higher as lower priced generator segments (away from loads) are switched off and higher priced generator segments (closer to the load) are turned on.

From Figure 14, it is evident that the system marginal price has increased to $105.30 /MWh in the double objective case from $55.10/MWh in the single objective case. The market efficiency is lowered to 80.59% in the double objective case from 100% in the single objective case. Table 5 summarizes the relationship between voltage stability margin maximization and market efficiency in the 118-bus system. From the preceding analysis, the following are clear:  - When load centers are away from inexpensive generators, rescheduling to maximize voltage stability moves generation to expensive generators closer to loads so that voltage stability improves. - A higher voltage stability therefore means, a higher system marginal price. - A higher voltage stability also yields a lower market efficiency.

CHAPTER 5

CONCLUSIONS
This thesis studies the effect of maximizing voltage stability margin on market efficiency. To this end, this thesis proposes a formulation and its solution that works on two stages. The first stage minimizes the generation cost and settles the market to get the maximum seller surplus that can be extracted from the system and accordingly the maximum efficiency of the electricity market for the system. The second stage tries to maximize the voltage stability of the system in order to see how the market efficiency changes from the initial value when the system moves towards a more stable configuration. Thereafter, the thesis studies two systems, a 5-bus test system and the IEEE 118bus test system. The 5-bus system is created with two cases. The results of the three study cases show the negative effect that a voltage stability maximization objective has on the market efficiency of a power system. a) In the first case (case #1), the load is located far away from inexpensive generation. In this case, optimizing only for the cost moves the generation to inexpensive generators (inframarginal units) leading to a low voltage stability margin, a low MW Margin to Voltage Collapse and high market efficiency. When both the objectives are optimized, it assigns generation to expensive units (extramarginal units) located closer to loads where by the solution cost increases and voltage stability represented in the min singular value and the MW Margin to Voltage Collapse improves while the market efficiency lowers.

48   

Chapter 5 Conclusions  

b) In the second case (case #2), loads are located closer to inexpensive generators and it shows that optimizing for one or both objectives moves generation to the inexpensive generator (inframarginal units) that minimizes costs and maximizes voltage stability margin whilst having the best market efficiency. c) As a final example, the 118-bus system with modifications is studied. This study shows once more that as we optimize both objectives, the solution moves generation to expensive units (extramarginal units) closer to the loads. This achieves a higher voltage stability margin but lower market efficiency. While one cannot make a definite case that inexpensive generators are always located away from the loads, it is most likely the case in a real power system. Hence, optimizing for voltage stability margin would lead to a reduced market efficiency. In future, the research could be extended to consider a multi-commodity market. A more general configuration for the electricity market in which supply offers are made for both real and reactive powers can be designed.

Appendix A: Minimum Singular Value Decomposition of the Jacobian [16]

The incremental change in any singular value of the load flow Jacobian is represented in terms of the incremental change in the state of the power system. The details are as below. Using Singular Value Decomposition, the load flow Jacobian, [J] is represented as: [J (, V)] = [SL] [ (, V)] [SR]t (A1)

where [SL] and [SR] are orthogonal singular vector matrices and [] is a diagonal matrix comprising the singular values. Considering a small perturbation in the state,  and V, (A1) is written as: [J (+ , V+ V)] = [SL+SL] [ + ] [SR+SR]t (A2)

Left Hand Side of (A2) is expanded using Taylor's series and only the first order term of the series containing the load flow hessian [H] is retained while neglecting the higher order terms to get:
  [J] = J(  + , V + V) - J(, V) = [H]    V 

(A2.1)

Using above to represent Left Hand Side of (A2) and expanding Right Hand Side of (A2) retaining only the first order terms, (A2) is re-written as:
  [H]   = [ SL ][ ][SR ]t + [SL ][  ][SR ]t + [SL ][ ][ SR ]t  V 

(A3)

Imposing orthogonality constraints on the updated left and right singular vector matrices one gets:
50   

Appendices and (A4) [SR + SR] [SR + SR] = I        Expanding (A4) neglecting the second order terms and using the orthogonality property of [SL] and [SR], the matrices [SM] and [SN] are written as:
[SN] = [SL] t [  SL] = - [  SL] t [SL]
 

[SL + SL] [SL + SL] = I

and      (A5)

[SM] = [  SR] t [SR] = - [SR] t [  SR]

From (A5), it can be seen that the diagonal elements of [SN] and [SR] are zeros. Premultiplying and postmultiplying (A3) with [SL]t and [SR] respectively, (A3) is written as:

  [SL]t [H] [SR] = [SN][] + [] + [][SM]  V 

(A6)

Since [SN][] and [][SM] have zeros as their diagonal elements, the diagonal elements of (A6) are equated as:     i = []ii = [SL]t [H] [SR]  V   ii  (A7)
