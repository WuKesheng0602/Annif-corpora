Abstract

A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODEL OF CANADIAN RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS AND BUILDING STOCKS Matthew Francis Bowick Master of Applied Science (2011) in the Program of Building Science, Ryerson University Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an internationally recognized and scientifically based methodology to quantify the environmental impact of a product or service, typically from cradle-to-grave. The life cycle performance of housing is influenced by the interdependent nature of material and energy use, and dwelling location and service life. While much research has been conducted building LCA, its incorporation into regulation has been difficult to implement. This research outlines the methodology used to create an LCA database of new Canadian construction for the purpose of building stock modeling and benchmarking national construction practice, two key tools for higher level decision making. A software program has been developed to handle data storage and calculations. Results presented include general performance trends at various sector scales, an analysis comparing LCA to traditional environmental performance measurement, and sensitivity analysis of [1] building material and operating energy fuel choice and [2] energy efficiency measures.

1.0 INTRODUCTION Since the oil crises of the 1970's there has been a growing awareness of the residential sector's significant use of natural resources and impact on the environment. Regulation has helped improve the environmental performance of housing through changes to building codes, energy efficiency programs and standards, and government subsidies. These initiatives have thus far focused exclusively on the reduction of secondary energy use (SE). More recently, voluntary green building rating systems such as LEED for Homes [1] have been introduced. These standards take a more complete approach by addressing additional aspects such as site effects, indoor air quality, and water and material use. While both energy related regulation and green building rating systems aim to reduce environmental effects, neither require significant or accurate quantification of actual environmental impacts. Building stock modeling is a tool available to policymakers to make informed decisions about regulation. There are many models that have been developed to characterize national existing stock SE, some that also calculate associated global warming potential emissions (GWP) [2]. According to this type of analysis the Canadian residential sector in 2007 consumed 1447 PJ of SE, accounting for 16% [3] of total SE. The associated GWP at building site and electricity generation plants were 74.3 Mt [3], or 10% of total emissions [4]. While SE and associated GWP are responsible for a significant share of energy use and emissions within Canada, analysis with this system boundary can provide misleading conclusions about the sector as it does not account for upstream effects of energy production, the effects of constructing, maintaining, and disposing of dwellings, nor does it account for transportation-related energy use. Kohler et al. [5] concluded that future modeling should evolve to incorporate environmental, economic and societal implications of the built environment. One of the steps towards this goal is conducting building stock modeling according to life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. LCA is a methodology to quantify the environmental impact of a product or service typically from "cradle-to-grave", meaning that mass and energy flows to and from nature

1

are quantified throughout the service life. LCA is a scientifically based, internationally recognized methodology, described by ISO standards 14040/44 [6,7]. This standardization provides credibility and a degree of predictability when reviewing or comparing studies. LCA provides the following improvements to typical energy end-use modeling: Â· LCA quantifies environmental impacts and resource use in numerical terms; calculation of SE use is an intermediate step in this process; Â· LCA considers not only service end-uses (operating energy consumption) but also product end-uses (embodied effects of dwellings). The relationship between material and energy use is therefore inherently considered; Â· By considering all dwelling life cycle stages, more effects initiated by end-uses are captured. Decision makers therefore gain insight into how buildings influence other sectors (e.g. transportation, mining, energy and material production); Â· The model provides a more rigorous environmental assessment since many building sector related impacts are dominated by material use; Â· An environmental life cycle framework facilitates expansion of analysis scope to include life cycle costing (LCC) and social LCA. Life cycle energy consumption and environmental performance of housing is a function of building-defined inputs such as material and fuel choice, and location and geometry. Performance can equally be influence by LCA practice, including choice of system boundary, life cycle inventory data sources and energy simulation software. While past research (see Section 2.2) has identified many key concepts and performance trends, performance is influenced by too many parameters to generally provide accurate conclusions beyond a particular study's scope. This disconnect between research and practice is further complicated by the intensive data and computational requirements which make dwelling analysis typically of limited scope. One of the inherent requirements of conducting LCA building stock modeling is a more extensive scope within a consistent methodological framework. This allows for analysis of national performance trends that can be relayed to building stakeholders. Another inherent requirement is that LCA performance of existing and/or current building practice is
2

characterized according to statistical data. Benchmarking is a central step in the integration of whole building LCA into building codes, energy efficiency programs and green building rating systems such as LEED [8]. 1.1 Problem Statement Problem For the building sector, higher level decision making with LCA has been difficult to implement due its interdisciplinary nature and intensive data and calculation requirements. This thesis work outlines frameworks to conduct batch assessment of dwellings and building stock modeling according to LCA. The frameworks provide a means to break the barriers that currently exist between LCA practice and higher level decision making such as building code or green building standard development, urban planning, or policy writing. 1.2 Goals and Objectives The goal of this work is to further research on LCA of Canadian housing and illustrate that it can be used to make higher level building sector decisions. The research purpose is not necessarily to make accurate predictions for the residential sector; rather, it is meant to provide new insights as to the impact of residential construction and the degree to which designers and policy makers can improve performance within current technological, manufacturing, and energy supply constraints. The objectives of this research are to: 1) Develop frameworks to conduct batch LCA of housing and bottom-up LCA building stock modeling; 2) Characterize new Canadian residential construction based on statistical data and building regulation (i.e. benchmark), and perform whole dwelling and building stock analysis;

3

3) Expand the scope of available LCA data to include the embodied effects of (i) other envelope assemblies (ii) electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and domestic hot water (DHW) systems, and the effects of wood combustion; 4) Develop a software program to facilitate batch dwelling and building stock LCA; 5) Explore the sensitivity of Baseline case dwellings and building stock with respect to (i) building material and operating fuel choice and (ii) energy efficient design initiatives. Building stock modeling according to LCA methodology incorporates material usage into the established energy end-use modeling framework. This requires statistical analysis of Canadian construction practice and household energy use, the quantification of energy usage via simulation, and calculation of material quantities for archetype dwellings. The resulting database of dwelling information is aggregated in such a way to describe a building stock, or can be analyzed at the dwelling scale. The database of LCA data assembled is to be of sufficient breadth to cover the materials and fuels considered in research. For items currently not available in an LCA database, data is generated by modeling the process chain of the product or service throughout its life cycle, typically with proprietary LCA software. Sensitivity analysis of material and fuel choice is assessed by quantifying the effects of changes to design parameters. A literature and statistical review of available energy efficiency measures allows for an analysis of how these parameters influence dwelling and building stock performance. 1.3 Hypothesis By illustrating the interdependent relationship between material and energy use, the significance of embodied and energy pre-combustion effects, and the sensitivity of results, it is expected that building stock modeling according to LCA methodology will prove to be a significant and appropriate improvement to the practice of end-use energy modeling. Benchmarking Canadian construction is expected to highlight the performance variation that exists in Canada and the reasons why.

1.4 Thesis Organization Section 2 provides background information for the content of the research work. This includes a description of life cycle assessment methodology, past research highlights of residential dwelling LCA, energy end-use building stock modeling, and LCA building stock modeling. Wherever possible, background information presented is Canadian in scope. This was done in order to keep all information relative to the scope of this research. The aim of this section is to provide readers a rudimentary understanding of LCA, its applications in the residential sector, general performance characteristics, and conclusions that have been drawn from previous work. Section 3 outlines the research scope, data sources, and introduces the database of dwelling LCA and how it is structured. These definitions are critical to understanding the research method and data presented in Section 4. The methodology describes data decisions for the database parameters location, archetype, material/fuel use, and energy design. Following that is an explanation of other important model characteristics such as LCA data, energy simulation assumptions, and construction forecast. Section 5 presents Res-BEAT, the software developed to store the housing database and calculate and present results. Its structure and modeling capacity are explained. Sample output from the program is given in Section 6 according to the research objectives. Results include analysis at both the whole dwelling, provincial, and national scales. Section 6.2 presents the Baseline or "business as usual" case and then Sections 6.3 though 6.5 show the degree to which changes in material and fuel use, and operating energy efficiency influence results. Section 7 provides additional commentary on the research topic and results, model limitations, and future work. Finally, a summary of research conclusions are presented in Section 8.

2.0 BACKGROUND 2.1 Life Cycle Assessment Life cycle assessment is typically a "cradle-to-grave" approach for quantifying and interpreting environmental impacts associated with product and/or service systems. "Cradle-to-grave" refers to all industrial processes beginning with the raw resources harvested from earth and ending with materials returned to it. In quantifying the effects associated with each stage of the life cycle, LCA provides a comprehensive estimation of the cumulative environmental effects initiated by an end-use. Figure 2.1 shows the basis of an assessment. LCA is the process of quantifying an inventory of energy and resource inputs, as well as air, water, land emissions and other outputs within a system boundary for each stage of the life cycle. An environmental assessment is then evaluated based on these flows to and from nature. Inventory flows are quantified in terms of actual mass and energy balance relationships (i.e. the conservation of energy and mass) and impact assessment is evaluated with methodologies developed by scientific consensus. It can therefore be said that LCA aims to provide objective, Figure 2.1: Life Cycle Stages [8]

6

scientifically based conclusions. Furthermore, burden-shifting to other parts of the product life cycle or other impacts of concern is avoided due to the breadth of analysis. Current applications of LCA include product development and improvement, strategic planning, public policy making, and marketing. Although life cycle principles were used to calculate energy flows and resource use as early as the 1960's the methodological framework for conducting LCA wasn't formalized until the 1990's. Beginning in 1997, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) began publishing LCA standards. A second edition of the standards was published in 2006 which includes ISO 14040, Environmental Management - Life-cycle Assessment - Principles and Framework [6], and ISO 14044, Environmental Management - Life-cycle Assessment - Requirements and Guidelines [7]. This standardization provides credibility to the methodology as studies are conducted in a consistent manner. Figure 2.2: The Four Stages of Life Cycle Assessment [5]

2.1.1 ISO 14040/14044 ISO 14040 outlines LCA practice and its applications and ISO 14044 describes in detail the requirements for conducting an assessment. As illustrated in Figure 2.2, life cycle
7

assessment according to ISO 14040/14044 standards is a four-stage iterative process consisting of goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation. Conducting an LCA is not a linear process; each stage of a study may need to be revised several times before completion. 2.1.2 Goal and Scope Definition The goal and scope definition stage outlines the purpose and methodology of the assessment. Goal defining includes stating the reasons for carrying out a study, its intended application and audience and whether results are to be used in comparative assertions disclosed to the public. There are many study scope items that need to be described so that it is clear what is being studied, how data is collected and manipulated and what measures are to be taken in order to ensure confidence in the study's conclusions and recommendations. Some important scope items related to inventory analysis to be defined include: Â· Functional unit: the basis of comparison which can include a description of a product or service's function, performance quality and duration, physical or spatial concerns. Â· Reference flow: relates the input and output relationships for processes in the product system to the functional unit. Â· System boundary: the extent of processes included in scope, consistent with the goal of the study. The product system is evaluated based on mass, energy, or environmental significance cut-off criteria. Â· Allocation procedures: the criteria by which inventory flows of a process or product system are partitioned between the system boundary and one or more other product systems.

The goal and scope definition stage details the methodology for impact assessment and what interpretation is to be conducted. Other study procedures such as assumptions, limitations, report format, and critical review (if any) are also explained. 2.1.3 Inventory Analysis The inventory analysis stage is where inventory flow data is collected and reported for each activity in the process chain (i.e. system boundary). Data is related to the functional unit and assessed based on the data requirements and procedures established in the goal and scope definition stage. One of the first steps of inventory analysis is typically to develop a detailed system flow diagram for the system studied. This not only identifies all the various processes involved in the products system, but also the relationship between them. A simplified diagram for a residential dwelling is presented in Figure 2.3, by life cycle stage. Data collection takes place at the unit process scale, defined as the smallest element considered in the life cycle inventory analysis for which input and output data are quantified. Examples of a unit process could be iron ore mining, ore transportation, steel smelting, etc. At this scale inventory flows are noted, including energy and material/product inputs, outputs to earth in the form of emissions to air, water, and land, and finished or intermediate products. When this has been completed for each unit process in the system boundary, results are validated and computed in relation to the reference flow of the functional unit. The resulting life cycle inventory (LCI) is a list of inputs and outputs to and from nature expressed in physical units such as mass, volume, joules, etc. LCI data can be organized according to process, process group or life cycle stage and further classified according to type of flow (e.g. energy vs. material input, emission to land vs. air). 2.1.4 Impact Assessment The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) stage involves evaluating environmental impacts from the LCI results. This first step is the selection of impact indicators and the assessment methodologies to be used in the study. The LCI data is then grouped (classified) among the various impacts and converted (characterized) to the common unit of each indicator. Characterization factors are applied to each inventory flow in
9

order to relate the degree to which each flow contributes to the impact indicator. For example, global warming potential (GWP) is generally calculated on a mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent basis. The characterization factor for CO2 is therefore 1, whereas other greenhouse gas emissions contribute more or less to GWP per unit mass compared to CO2. For example, on a 100 year time scale methane is 25 times as powerful an emission compared to CO2 and its characterization factor is 25. Adding all characterized emissions gives the final impact result. Optional assessment procedures include normalization, grouping, weighting, and data quality analysis. These elements are generally meant to give more insight as to the relevance of the impact results. Figure 2.3: Simplified Process Diagram for a Typical Residential Dwelling [10]

2.1.5 Interpretation The objective of the interpretation stage is to provide credible and transparent conclusions and recommendations in accordance with the stated goals and scope. The ISO standard outlines a systematic process to analyze LCI and LCIA data in order to assess the quality and characteristics of the results. The first step is to review stages 1 through 3 in order to identify what elements contribute most to each product, service, or other process in the system boundary. This process is known as identifying "significant issues". In order to facilitate analysis, the practitioner may employ several techniques to identify significant issues, including contribution analysis, dominance analysis, or anomaly assessment. In the second step, the reliability and confidence in the data is assessed by checking its completeness, sensitivity, and consistency. The completeness check ensures that all data relevant for interpretation has been included and is typically assessed with a checklist of processes included in the LCI. The sensitivity check evaluates the reliability of the results by determining whether uncertainty in the significant issues identified allows conclusions to be drawn with confidence. Data quality techniques typically employed for this purpose includes contribution, uncertainty, and sensitivity analysis. Finally, the consistency check determines whether the study has been executed in a manner consistent with the goal and scope of the study for each process evaluated. If after completion of steps 1 and 2 it is determined that conclusions cannot be drawn with confidence, items in any of the first three stages of the study are revised and steps 1 and 2 are repeated. The final step of interpretation is to report study conclusions and provide recommendations in accordance with the defined goals. This might include an analysis of which product contributes least to specific human health and environmental impacts or the trade-offs associated with design decisions. 2.2 Residential Dwelling LCA In the past fifteen years there has been a wealth of research conducted on LCA of residential dwellings, particularly single detached dwellings (SDDs) [11-21]. Assessments vary in terms of methodological considerations and data sources, yet a
11

literature review of studies by Ramesh et al. [22] reveals that in cold climates primary energy consumption of conventional housing varies between 150-400 kWh/m2/yr, 8090% of which is related to building operational energy use. The remaining 10-20% is related to the other building activities such as material production and transport as well and construction and demolition. For the purpose of this thesis, these effects are called "embodied" effects. As previously noted, there are many parameters that influence the environmental performance of residential dwellings. As such, an attempt has been made to isolate the following and discuss their significance individually: (i) geographic location, (ii) operating systems, (iii) building materials and (iv) energy efficiency initiatives. 2.2.1 Effect of Geographic Location Two dwelling geographic location-related parameters that significantly influence dwelling life cycle effects are climate and upstream energy effects. Since the operating energy stage typically dominates life cycle primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the degree to which a home needs to be heated and cooled is an important consideration. For example, Adalberth [23] compared life cycle energy use of three single detached dwellings (SSDs) in Sweden (Stockholm, 4,589 HDD [24]) with 50 year service life, and concluded that the operating energy stage generally accounted for 85% of total energy use. In contrast, Mithraratne et al. [25] compared three SDDs in New Zealand (Auckland, 1,166 HDD [26]) with 100 year service and concluded that operating energy accounted for 57% to 74% of total energy use. So despite the fact that the dwelling service life of [23] was twice that of [25], the percent operating effects was still lower due to in part to New Zealand's climate. Canada is considered to have a cold climate but there is a large variation in heating degree days (HDD) with location. According to HOT2000 [24] energy simulation analysis if a 200m2 SDD in Winnipeg (5,900 HDD) consumes 2,973m3 of natural gas for space heating (SH), the equivalent home will use 2,264m3 in Ottawa (4,600 HDD), and 1,297m3 in Vancouver (2,925 HDD). In this case Ottawa and Vancouver consume 24% and 56% less SH energy, respectively, which can have considerable effect on life cycle impacts.

12

Dwelling location can dramatically affect the upstream effects associated with SE consumption. In the case of natural gas, the pipe system a dwelling draws from will determine the likely location(s) where it was produced and the distance it traveled to reach the user. Similarly, dwelling location influences from what refinery heating oil is likely produced and how it is delivered. Perhaps the most dramatic difference in upstream effects is related to electricity use. Table 2.1 shows the electricity generation fuel use mixes and the associated greenhouse gas emission fuel combustion intensities for each Canadian province from [4]. Depending on what province a dwelling is located in, consuming a kWh of electricity results in very different fuel mixes combusted at power plants and varying transmission losses. The resulting provincial greenhouse gas emissions vary considerably, from 4 to 870 g CO2 eq./kWh, for Quebec and Alberta, respectively. To put this difference in context, according to the NRCan's Comprehensive Energy Use Database (CEUD) [3] the average annual per household electricity use for Table 2.1: Canadian Electricity Generation Fuel Mixes (%)1

appliances and lighting (AL) in Canada in 2007 was 5,418kWh. This represents a difference of 4.7 tonnes of GWP emitted annually between a household in Quebec to one in Alberta. Variation in upstream effects for SE use also affects the industrial sector and hence the embodied effects of producing materials. Bowick et al [27] compared the

13

embodied GWP of structural and envelope materials for an SDD dwelling in Montreal and Calgary and found the dwelling in Calgary embodied 52% more GWP. A significant consideration for predicting future building life cycle impacts is the sensitivity of changes to electricity fuel mixes on impact. A British study [28] investigated the effect of a dynamic electricity generation model on the impact of a new semidetached home. It found that an incremental reduction in electricity GWP intensity of 95% over 40 years (2010-2049) reduced dwelling operational effects by 50%. 2.2.2 Effect of Operating Energy Systems Choice For any given dwelling the environmental impact of operating energy use is a function of equipment efficiency, occupant habits (i.e. consumption), and the type of fuels consumed. If fuel choice remains constant there is a direct relationship between equipment efficiency, occupant habits, and impact. For example, if a natural gas furnace with 85% AFUE is replaced with one with 90% AFUE, one can expect that SH emissions will be reduced by 5.6% (neglecting embodied effects). Similarly, if an occupant reduces the heating set point of their home, the reduction in emissions is proportional to the fuel use reduction. As noted in Section 2.2.1 dwelling location has a significant influence on the effect of energy use, particularly electricity consumption. The environmental profiles of differently fuelled appliances therefore cannot be compared based solely on efficiency ratings. Bowick et al. [27] investigated the effects of changes to SH and DHW systems for a dwelling in Montreal, Toronto, and Calgary. An SDD was designed with both "standard" and "high" performance characteristics which approximate local building code and R2000 standard performance [29], respectively. For each performance design, the SH and DHW were parametrically varied between natural gas and electric fuelled systems. The study found that despite a reduction in SE use of approximately 27% for the "high" performance design, the "standard" design was responsible for less GWP, depending on the fuel choice case. In Calgary the natural gas systems performed better than electric systems due to the high GWP intensity of electricity generation, whereas electric systems performed better than natural gas systems in Montreal due to the low GWP
14

intensity of electricity generation. In Toronto the "high" performance design generally performed better regardless of fuel use case due to the balanced electricity generation mix. This research underscores the importance of choosing heating systems with regard to regional electricity generation mix. Other studies from North America confirm these results. For instance, Yang et al. [30] compared the performance of electric and natural gas fuelled hot water and forced air systems for a SDD in Montreal. In this case both electric fuelled systems were responsible for fewer GWP than natural gas fuelled systems. Kikuchi et al. [31] evaluated the SE consumption and related GWP for a SDD in five Canadian cities. A condensing natural gas SH/DHW boiler system was compared to the same system with a ground source heat pump (GSHP) as the primary SH appliance. The study found that annual reductions in GWP for the GSHP case were in the order of 45% in Vancouver and Montreal (hydro dominated electricity), 23% in Toronto and Ottawa (balanced electricity mix), but increased by 3% in Calgary due to the coal dominated electricity mix. The influence of regional electricity mix was also investigated by Shah et al. [32] for three HVAC system combinations, in four American cities. The research found that an air-to-air heat pump performed best in Oregon where electricity is dominated by hydropower, and a natural gas furnace/air-conditioner combination performed best in the other three locations where electricity generation is dominated by coal. The embodied effects of electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and DHW systems are often left out of whole dwelling analysis due to lack of public primary data on manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, these effects, or elements of them, have been estimated in several studies [33][34]. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's (CMHC) report A Life Cycle Environmental Assessment Benchmark Study of Six CMHC EQuilibriumTM Housing Initiative Projects [35] quantified the effects of service equipment components for various dwelling designs. The study found that "cradle-to-gate" (i.e. cradle to manufacturing plant gate) effects of these components were in the order of 713%, 7-11%, 9%, and 5-8% of embodied GWP, primary energy use, photochemical smog, and solid waste, respectively, for building code compliant SDDs in Sherbrooke, Ottawa, and Edmonton. Embodied GWP of the hot water and forced air SH systems
15

(including distribution systems) studied by Yang et al. [30] were estimated to be in the order of 6-7%, and 3%, respectively. The embodied effects of household appliances are other items typically left of building analysis. An LCA study [36] of a refrigerator, dryer, washing machine, and a dishwasher found that these appliances together consumed 19.8 GJ in production. Assuming 15-year service lives, the embodied energy of these four appliances (including periodic replacement) would account for a notable share of effects over the service life of a dwelling. 2.2.3 Effect of Building Material Choice Building material related life cycle effects are a function of the choice of materials, the dwelling service life, as well assembly choice (i.e. material quantity, design). Bowick et al. [27] assessed the effect of structural and envelope material choice for a SDD with 150mm stud wall construction. The intent was to estimate the degree to which material choice can influence impact when envelope thermal performance does not change. Changes in envelope thermal resistance due different cladding, roofing, structural materials etc. was therefore negated. Each assembly choice was parametrically varied and a best and worst case material combination determined. The study found that dwelling embodied GWP varied by a factor of three. Material substitution in low energy housing was also investigated by Thormak et al. [37]. The study found that by substituting envelope materials while maintaining thermal performance embodied energy, initially 40% of total energy use, could be reduced by 17%. Dwelling service life and the durability of its assemblies determine the rate at which materials are maintained and/or replaced. Materials commonly replaced, including glazing, cladding, and roofing products, are typically emission intensive and can lead to a significant share of embodied impact. For instance, Happio et al. [38] determined the embodied impacts of an SDD with various building envelope choices and service lives. Maintenance effects for the cases considered were in the order of a 35% to 61% increase when going from a 60 to 160 year service life. A similar analysis [27] found that the embodied GWP of a dwelling increased by 25% when its service life was changed from 60 to 100 years.

16

Envelope design not only influences thermal performance, but also material choice and quantities. A life cycle analysis illustrates the degree to which these embodied effects can change for different design decision. An Athena study [39] assessed the life cycle implications of wall envelope improvements of a SDD located in Montreal, Toronto, and Calgary with (i) 2x6 stud walls (ii) double stud walls (iii) structural insulated panel (SIP) walls. A different set of envelope improvements was applied to each such that thermal resistance increased by 0.9-1.4 RSI for walls, 1.2-1.7 RSI for foundation walls, and 0.25 RSI for windows. The resulting additional material usage increased total dwelling embodied GWP, primary energy use, smog potential, and solid waste by 7Â­8%, 9Â­10%, 16Â­22%, and 4-5%, respectively. Another study by Pierquet et al. [40] researched a SDD in Springfield and Minneapolis with 12 wall assemblies of different structure and thermal performance (15.5-44.8 R-value). Assemblies included various stud walls (2x4, 2x6, I-joist), double stud wall, straw bale, cordwood, insulated concrete forms and autoclaved insulated concrete. The embodied energy of the wall assemblies was found to vary by a factor 2.6, influencing the total dwelling embodied energy by a factor of 1.3. 2.2.4 Effect of Energy Efficiency Initiatives Due to the current impetus to reduce energy consumption in housing one of the more researched aspects of dwelling LCA is the relationship between embodied (i.e. material) and operating energy impacts. Energy reduction initiatives include passive strategies such as better performing building envelopes, and active strategies such as more energy efficient appliances and HVAC systems, and renewable/energy efficiency technologies such as photovoltaic arrays. Generally speaking, these activities require additional material inputs compared to traditional construction. The move towards low energy housing therefore has two effects: the embodied component increases with increased material use and a reduction in operating energy stage impact increases the percent embodied of total effects. This trend was confirmed by Satori et al. [41], who conducted a review of 60 published LCAs on housing of varying efficiency. The CMHC Equilibrium initiative is a demonstration project showcasing net-zero buildings across Canada. The life cycle impacts of six of the CMHC EQuilibrium

17

dwellings were assessed and compared to equivalent minimum 2006 Ontario Building Code (OBC) and R2000 compliant designs [35]. Of the four SDDs considered, changes in life cycle impacts between building code compliant and net-zero (or near net-zero) designs varied by impact indicator; over the first 20 years of predicted dwelling operation, the net-zero designs showed reductions of primary energy and GWP of 7087% and 62-90%, respectively. For impact indicators that can be dominated by material use such as photochemical smog, ozone depletion, solid waste, and water use, impacts were found to generally increase, depending on location. This illustrates the trade-offs that can exist for increased material usage and the need to analyze more than a single indicator in order to gain a balanced perspective on the environmental performance of design choices. Between building code compliant and net-zero designs, the embodied GWP emissions increased between 31% and 80%, with much of it attributed to increases in insulation quantities, the type of insulation used, and renewable energy systems such as solar thermal and photovoltaic arrays. Bowick et al. [27] assessed an SDD in Toronto with six designs of incrementally better SE ranging from 163 to 40 kWh/m2/year. Improvements include better performing envelopes through increased air tightness and thermal resistance, higher efficiency HVAC equipment, lower hot water and AL electricity use, and renewable energy systems such as solar thermal and photovoltaic arrays. Between best and worst designs over a 60 year life cycle, operating energy GWP reduced by 421 tonnes and embodied GWP increased by 38 tonnes. It therefore is a worthy investment impact wise as each ton of embodied investment yields a reduction of 11 tonnes operating impact. In doing so, the percent embodied GWP increased from 11% to 44% of the total. 2.3 Energy End-Use Building Stock Modeling Modeling energy use of the residential sector can be done with either top-down or bottom-up approaches, the choice of which depends on the type of information sought. Top-down models do not differentiate between end-uses; these models generally analyze energy consumption of the entire sector with respect to changes in economical

18

and technological conditions. Bottom-up models quantify energy consumption at the end-use or dwelling scale and extrapolate the results to the building stock scale using weighting factors. Energy consumption can be assessed by various statistical means or by calculating energy directly by using engineering principles (e.g. building energy simulation). A review of typical modeling techniques is presented by Swan et al. [42]. Bottom-up engineered energy end-use models have the significant advantage of being able to assess various upgrade scenarios and therefore provide a good framework for the inclusion of LCA methodology. A review of some of the engineered models developed thus far is provided by Kavgic et al. [2]. The first bottom-up model in Canada was developed in the late 1990's at the Canadian Residential Energy End-use Data Analysis Centre (CREEDAC) [43]. The Canadian Residential Energy End-use Model (CREEM) [44] characterizes the existing detached and attached housing stock with information from the NRCan's 1993 Household Survey of Energy Use (SHEU) [45] and other database information on the Canadian housing stock. The resulting 8,767 house descriptions are simulated in a batch version of HOT2000; GWP associated with site fuel combustion and electricity generation are also calculated. CREEM has been used for various analyses of building stock upgrade scenarios. For example, Farahbakhsh et al. [44] analyzed the energy reduction of dwellings built after 1960 for various upgrade rates to R2000 and National Energy Code for Houses (NECH) standards. The study found that if 10 to 90% of the existing stock was retrofitted to R2000 and NECH standards total sector energy consumption would be reduced by 1-13% and 1-11%, respectively. Similarly, CREEM analysis by Guler et al. [46] included various retrofitting scenarios (e.g. increased wall insulation) for the reduction of SE use and GWP. Another Canadian model is currently in development. The Canadian Hybrid Residential End-use Energy and Emissions Model (CHREM) is a hybrid bottom-up model that uses both statistical and engineering techniques [47]. Unit energy consumption for appliances, lighting and hot water use are determined from a calibrated neural network technique and then simulated along with SH and cooling using the software ESP-r. Model dwelling characteristics are from to the Canadian Single Detached and
19

Double/Row Housing Database (CSDDRD), a database consisting of 17,000 house descriptions representative of the Canadian housing stock. The CSDDRD is a subset of the EnerGuide for Homes database consisting of data for over 200,000 energy audits. 2.4 LCA Building Stock Modeling The CMHC report Life-cycle Environmental Impacts of the Canadian Residential Sector [48] estimates impacts related to Canadian residential housing, infrastructure, and transportation for the period 2004-2025. This report is the only work in Canada on the life cycle impacts of the residential sector. National dwelling energy consumption was calculated according to a bottom-up approach assuming existing dwellings undergo renovation/retrofitting activities and efficiency improvements. New dwellings were assessed based on the latest energy use data available, with adjustments made to account for current construction trends. The report estimates that new construction for the period 2004- 2025 will represent 25% of the Canadian housing stock. Building material usage was estimated only for new construction from a single archetype for each dwelling type. Energy and material (i.e. operational and embodied) related impacts were calculated based on national average LCA profiles. The results therefore do not take into account regionalized manufacturing practices and differences in provincial electricity generation mixes with respect to dwelling distribution. The report concluded that 75%-95% of housing impacts were related to the operating energy stage during the study period. The study classifies housing according to both dwelling and neighborhood type. It was found that single detached dwellings contributed significantly more to life cycle emissions, approximately 1.3 times that of semi-detached/row housing, and twice that of low and high-rise apartments and condominiums. Similarly, it was found that dwellings in outer suburbs on average accounted for 25% more emissions than inner suburbs and 50% more than inner city neighborhoods. This was attributed to differences in transportation habits and distances, as well as dwelling type distribution (i.e. more detached dwellings).

20

A bottom-up LCA of the European Union (EU) building stock was prepared for the European Commission's Integrated Product Policy framework [49]. The objective of the report was to estimate impacts of residential buildings in the EU-25, identify improvement options, and analyze the environment benefits and costs. Buildings in the EU were characterized by 72 archetypes representing 80% of the European stock. Archetypes were classified by single-family, multi-family and high-rise dwelling types and by southern, middle, and northern European climatic zones. The study found that newer dwellings generally performed better and northern zone buildings are responsible for more impact (per dwelling) due to climate. The use stage was identified as the dominant cause of emissions due to SH needs, whereas the construction stage (i.e. cradle to gate embodied effects) was more important in new dwellings. Use stage impacts were broken down by building element in order to assess potential improvement options. For existing dwellings, improvement options identified were replacement of windows, additional roof insulation, additional faÃ§ade insulation, and new sealings to reduce ventilation. For new dwellings, substitution of conventional building materials with wood was identified as an effective construction stage emission reduction strategy. The study concluded that the proposed improvements could reduce GWP by 30-50% over a 40 year period.

3.0 RESEARCH SCOPE 3.1 Functional Unit and System Boundary The research functional unit is the housing of inhabitants in a conditioned dwelling(s) along with plumbing and electrical services. The scope includes new Canadian detached, semi-detached and row housing. Based on CMHC housing completion data [50], these dwelling types represent 73% of Canadian residential construction over the period 1999-2009. While multi-unit residential buildings represent a significant share of dwelling completions, their construction is different from standard detached/attached housing in terms of building assemblies and HVAC systems and have therefore not been considered. The service life of dwellings is assumed to be 60 years. The product system encompasses the life cycle effects of all structural, envelope, interior finish, plumbing/electrical and HVAC materials, as well as annual operating energy use by application (SH, space cooling (SC), DHW, and AL). Manufacturing practice and energy supply characteristics (including electricity generation mix) are assumed to be static over the service life. Items left out of the research scope include the embodied effects of floor finishes, furniture, electrical and plumbing fixtures, millwork and household appliances. Also not considered are renewable energy systems (e.g. photovoltaic arrays, solar thermal systems), household water use (with the exception of energy use for hot water), and household solid waste. A brief description of each life cycle stage considered and their scope follows: Â· Manufacturing: primary resource harvesting and mining, manufacturing of materials into products, and transportation effects related to these activities. Â· Construction: transportation of finished products to site, and site related energy use and solid waste. Â· Maintenance and replacement: all manufacturing, construction, and end of life impacts related to replacing and maintaining dwelling assemblies during its operation. Also known as "recurring embodied effects".

22

Â·

Operating energy: impacts associated with energy end-uses of dwelling operation. This includes SH, SC, DHW, and AL. End of life: dwelling demolition energy use and solid waste, and transportation of waste to land fill. Effects of material reuse, recycling, and land filling not considered.

For the purpose of this report, environmental effects originating from the manufacturing, construction, maintenance and replacement, and end of life stages are called "embodied effects". Since the operating energy stage dominates total primary energy and GWP impacts, these effects have been typically further disaggregated into the constituent end-uses noted above. 3.2 LCA Data Sources The Athena Sustainable Materials Institute is a not-for-profit organization that has developed LCA databases and software, and consulted on various projects for two decades. The primary source of LCA data for the research is derived from the Institute's Environmental Impact Estimator (EIE) software database [51], which contains life cycle inventory (LCI) data for various building sector related materials and fuels. The data is periodically updated as it becomes available; currently, the oldest data is from 1996. The LCI data is characterized by the EIE to mid-point impacts indicators according to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) [52], a common impact assessment methodology, particularly in North America. A description of some of the impact indicators considered is presented in the report Glossary. The EIE database also provides life cycle primary energy and resource use results. The LCA data generally represents average effects associated with materials manufacturing or fuel combustion at the regional or national scale. For this reason, it can be argued that LCA is well suited for benchmarking construction performance and building stock modeling since they aim to assess average performance. The EIE database has data for approximately 95% of the structure, envelope, and finish materials considered in scope, and all fuels with the exception of wood combustion. Life
23

cycle data for items currently not available in the EIE database were estimated as described in Section 4.6. 3.3 Dwelling Database In order to perform the various analyses described, whole building LCA must be conducted on a scale beyond what is typically practiced. The information required for the research therefore was organized in a database. The database of whole dwelling LCA includes permutations of 36 cities, 29 dwelling archetypes, 3 material and fuel choices cases, and 6 energy efficiency design scenarios, totaling 18,792 assessments. Analysis can be conducted at the dwelling scale, or when dwellings are aggregated and weighted, at local, provincial or national building stock scales. The database has the capacity to quantify midpoint environmental impact indicators, non-renewable (NRPE) and renewable (RPE) primary energy use and resource consumption, as well as SE and building product use. Figure 3.1 shows how the data is organized with four parameters that identify a dwelling's characteristics: 1) Location: identifies in which city a dwelling is located. 2) Archetype: identifies dwelling type with a letter (D for detached, S for semidetached and R for row) and dwelling size with a number. 3) Material/Fuel Use Case: identifies the mix of building materials and operating fuels used. There are three material/fuel use "Cases". Case A represents the best case, Case B is the Baseline from statistical analysis, and Case C is the worst case material/fuel mix. 4) Energy Design: identifies dwelling energy performance, including envelope characteristics (e.g. insulation quantities), service equipment efficiencies and household energy use (e.g. lighting). There are 6 energy "Designs". Design 1 is the Baseline reflecting current OBC requirements and energy efficiency standards, and household energy use from statistical analysis. Design 6 is the best performing design assessed according to current advanced energy efficient

24

envelopes and equipment efficiency, and minimum household energy use. The performance of Designs 2 through 5 are linear variations of Designs 1 and 6. For the purpose of this report, dwellings are labeled by location, archetype, followed by material/fuel case letter with energy performance deign number (e.g. Toronto D3 A5).

4.0 METHOD AND DATA This section provides an outline of the methodology and assumptions used to compile the dwelling database (4.1 to 4.5), estimate a construction forecast for the purpose of building stock modeling (4.6), and generate additional LCA data (4.7). 4.1 Geographic Locations The locations selected for inclusion in scope are meant to be characteristic of Canadian demographics and climate. Primary location selection is based on 2009 housing completion data for 59 urban areas [50]; these areas together accounted for 69% of detached, 83% of semi-detached, and 86% of row housing completions. An analysis of long-term climatic conditions was conducted for each location with Environment Canada climate normals data (averages based on climate stations with at least 15 years of data) [53]. Where two or more locations in the same province have similar climatic characteristics (i.e. HDD, latitude, etc.) only one was kept for inclusion. Generally speaking, HDD differences for cities omitted from scope are less than 100 with respect to their surrogate city. For example, Medicine Hat (4632 HDD, 49.6Â° latitude) was used as a surrogate for Lethbridge (4600 HDD, 50.0Â° latitude). The resulting 36 cities considered in scope are shown in Table 4.1, by province. 4.2 Dwelling Archetypes An archetype for each dwelling type was developed in order to characterize average construction in Canada. Housing characteristics conform to the Canadian archetypes developed for the CMHC report on life cycle effects of the residential sector [48]. Each dwelling is a two storey, 3 bedroom dwelling with full basement and pitched roof. Detached dwellings have a two car garage, 2 bathrooms, a length-to-width ratio of 1.3, and load bearing line at mid-width. Semi-detached and row housing (i.e. attached housing) have a one car garage, 1.5 bathrooms, a length-to-width ratio of 2, and structure was assumed to span the width. Garages are assumed to have uninsulated 150mm walls with interior finishes.

The ground floor has a clear height of 3.05m and the basement and second floors have a clear height of 2.44m. Given the lack of statistical data on typical window-to-wall ratios, it was assumed that that the front and rear walls have a ratio of 0.3 (30%) and side walls 0.1 (10%). This generally conforms to NRCan's best practice guidelines of Â±0.15 for total wall area [54]. Since there are no windows located on party walls, the window-to-exposed wall ratio is higher for semi-detached and row housing. Windows are assumed to be 50% fixed picture and 50% operable casement. The household size (i.e. number of residents) for each dwelling type presented in Table 4.2 was assessed provincially according to 2006 census information from Statistics Canada [55]. The attached dwelling household sizes include apartment buildings of five or less storeys and are therefore likely an underestimate actual number of residents.

In order to characterize the size of dwellings currently constructed in Canada, each dwelling type was assessed provincially by isolating new construction floor areas from NRCan's Provincial Comprehensive Energy Use Database (PCEUD) Tables 16 and 17. To smooth out irregularities in the data, a five year average (2003-2007) dwelling size was considered. The resulting average above grade floor areas are presented in Table 4.3. Archetypes were developed according to the above assumptions in increments of 10m2 above grade floor area. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 show designations and footprint dimensions for the resulting 11 detached and 9 semi-detached/row archetypes. The ranges of housing size were selected in order to be inclusive of the average floor areas noted in Table 4.3 and to allow for building stock modeling that considers changes in dwelling size (future work). As shown in Table 4.3, each province was allotted the archetypes (1 per dwelling type) closest in size; these dwelling sizes are used for all research analysis unless otherwise noted.

4.3 Material/Fuel Cases A, B, C Three building material and operating fuel (i.e. SH and DHW system) use Cases are included in the research scope in order to estimate the degree to which these design choices affect life cycle greenhouse gas emissions at the dwelling and building stock scale. As previously noted, Case B is the Baseline assessed based on statistical data, whereas Cases A and C represent best- and worst-case scenarios, respectively. 4.3.1 Material Choice The intent of the research is to create a model that provides conclusive and explainable results about the basic relationship between building material use (e.g. insulation level) and associated SE use. A couple assumptions were made about wall assemblies for this purpose. All above-grade walls are assumed to be single or double stud construction in order to (i) provide the 6 energy Designs a linearly increasing thermal resistance (see Section 4.4.1) and (ii) avoid discontinuities in results due to changes insulation type or systems. For database dwellings, in order to assess an incremental improvement to a wall assembly, either a single stud system is replaced with a double stud system or the double stud walls are placed further apart and insulation increased. Other wall systems, including structural insulated panel (SIP) and above grade concrete block wall were not considered as they do not conform to single/double stud construction. Foundation walls are similarly assumed to be insulated on the inside with varying insulation between inner stud wall and foundation wall. Other foundation wall systems such as insulated concrete form were therefore not considered. All dwellings in the database are assumed to have any combination of: Â· Â· Concrete footings and slab on grade; 200mm cast-in-place concrete or concrete block foundation walls and 90mm interior stud walls; Â· Â· 150mm (nominal) or 2-90mm (double stud) above grade stud walls; 2 Â­ 90mm party (i.e. shared) stud walls with cavity insulation and type X gypsum board for fire and sound proofing purposes;

250-300mm deep floor joists; Structural framing: sawn lumber, engineered lumber products, light gauge steel, structural steel (beams and columns only) and/or concrete block (basement columns only).

Â·

Insulation in wall cavities and ceiling joists.

Each structural system was independently designed according to the OBC [56], national construction codes, and/or proprietary design literature. Structural design was carried out for each archetype; therefore, the effect of dwelling type and size (i.e. structural span) is accounted for. As part of this research, a spreadsheet program named the Residential Archetype Materials Calculator (RAMC) was developed for the purpose of facilitating calculation of structural, envelope, and finishes bills of materials for each of the 29 archetypes and associated designs. RAMC relates geometric and structural information to detailed assembly quantities and allows for any combination of assembly choices to be proportioned by percent usage. This enables the user to input for example 50% brick veneer, 20% vinyl cladding, 15% wood siding and 15% fibreboard cladding in order to arrive at an "average" dwelling material use. The program also calculates other important information such as maintenance stage material quantities (by replacement period) and structural assembly areas for the purpose of construction stage impact calculations. A screenshot of RAMC is shown in Appendix C. Service equipment quantities were estimated according to several sources. The various electrical wire gauges, number of receptacle and lighting boxes, and electrical resistance heater wattage requirements for each archetype were calculated using a spreadsheet program developed for the research by Professor Frank Bowick (Algonquin College, Ottawa) [57]. The spreadsheet estimates these quantities based on the geometrical layout of a dwelling and its appliance use. Copper water supply and ABS drain, waste and vent plumbing lengths were estimated based on a house survey conducted for the research by Grant Finlayson of the Athena Institute. Plumbing lengths for other dwelling sizes were scaled according to floor area. Plumbing lengths for
31

radiant heating systems were calculated based the methodology presented in [58], and radiator weights were calculated by taking an average of material use from [30] and [32]. Total radiator weight was apportioned to the various archetypes based on floor area. Finally, ductwork for both forced air and radiant HVAC systems were estimated from material takeoffs noted in [32] and [33]. Case B: a detailed literature review found no public records on residential material use rates in Canada. Envelope and structural use rates for the benchmark case is based on survey data provided by the National Home Builder's Association [59] and consultation with building industry experts. The resulting envelope materials mix includes 9 cladding, 6 roofing, 4 insulation, and 4 window frame types. The Baseline assembly mix is shown in Table 4.6; structural items are not categorized by resulting materials mix but by design intent. This was done for two reasons: (i) it was deemed a more accurate method for building experts to weigh in on current construction practices and (ii) this reflects the way structure input is defined in RAMC. Cases A and C: the life cycle GWP of each type of envelope and structural assembly considered in scope was quantified separately for a detached dwelling located in Toronto with a 60 year service life. The best- and worst-performing combinations of assemblies for each category (i.e. cladding, structure, roofing, etc.) were then noted. Case A dwellings were allotted all the best performing assemblies whereas Case C dwellings were allotted the poorest performing assemblies. The 60 year service life was chosen in order to account for maintenance stage effects of the various envelope assemblies considered. Previous research [27] indicates that despite changes in embodied GWP with location, best- and worst-case assembly mixes do not change. The material mixes presented in Table 4.7 are therefore the same for each province. Generally speaking, wood products perform best and precast concrete, structural steel, and light gauge steel products perform poorest. It should be noted that these results are only for the research functional units (detached and attached housing), and therefore do not necessarily apply to other situations.

4.3.2 Space Heating and Hot Water System Choice Case B: during the literature review, no statistical data was found on average distribution or efficiency of service equipment commonly used in current or future construction. System use rates were therefore assessed based on statistical data of the existing stock (i.e. the entire building stock, including 100 year old dwellings and 1 year old dwellings). Table 4.8 presents the space heating equipment considered in the Baseline case and their provincial distribution by dwelling type. While the NRCan's 2007 Survey of Household Energy Use (SHEU) [45] has detailed information about Canada's SH stock, there are data gaps and therefore it was not used to determine equipment distribution. Instead, the distribution by fuel was determined from tables 22, 23 of NRCan's Provincial Comprehensive Energy Use Database (PCEUD) [3]. The category "other", defined as coal and propane, was assumed to be only propane as no information is available to disaggregate the two. For dual systems, 50% of the stock was allocated to each fuel and electric systems were assumed to be baseboard. Since the database does not differentiate between furnace and boiler use rates, a ratio of furnace to boiler was calculated from Table 3.2 of the SHEU.

all SH systems add to 100% for each province

While there is sufficient information to calculate ratios for each province, the statistical data is not complete enough to do this for each different fuel type. The ratios therefore do not consider that furnaces and boilers of different fuels will have different distributions. Boilers are assumed to deliver heat via piping and radiators rather than radiant floor systems as there was no statistical information found on radiant floor system rates. Electric boilers and furnaces were omitted from the research scope as

35

they are not specifically noted in the CEUD. The SHEU notes that there are 743,169 and 145,221 electric boilers and furnaces in Canada, respectively, yet this anomaly could not be reconciled due to discrepancies between the two sources. All heat pumps are assumed to be air-to-air units and have a temperature cut-off at the balance point. For lack of information, back-up for these units is assumed to be electrical baseboard.

As shown in Table 4.9, DHW systems included in the research scope are natural gas, electric, and oil fuelled, as per PCEUD Tables 28. Wood and "other" systems account for approximately 1% of the stock nationally and were omitted. Unlike SH, the CEUD only has DHW stock shares aggregated at the residential sector. System distribution therefore could not be determined by dwelling type. All systems are assumed to be 189L (50 gallon) storage tanks; storage tanks were the only type of system included in scope for simplicity; they currently account for over 80% of those currently used in Canada [60]. Cases A and C: SH and DHW system distribution for Cases A and C were determined by analysis of a detached dwelling located in Toronto. Annual fuel consumption for the dwelling was noted for each type of SH and DHW system. Fuel totals were then multiplied by life cycle GWP emissions data (kg CO2 eq./unit fuel) for each province and
36

the resulting best-performing and worst-performing systems allotted to Cases A and C, respectively. Only one dwelling type and location was required for analysis since these parameters do not influence relative fuel use between the various systems. With respect to GWP, wood fuelled SH systems perform best but were not considered as a best case. Instead, the best case SH was assumed to be a combination of Case B wood use rates and the system otherwise found to perform best. Table 4.10 shows the Case A and C system distributions by province.

4.4 Energy Designs 1 through 6 The six energy Designs included in the research scope are meant to provide the framework to explore how energy efficiency measures influence dwelling and building stock life cycle performance. As previously noted, designs describe the envelope characteristics, service equipment efficiencies and household energy use of a particular dwelling. Design 1 is the Baseline design, assessed based on minimum efficiencies and statistical data and Design 6 is a proposed best-case design. Unless otherwise noted, the general methodology for determining Design 6 characteristics was to estimate how dwellings could perform over the course of the next 40 years based on current available technology. The intent of this approach is to maintain conservative model assumptions. Designs 2 through 5 are linear interpolations of Designs 1 and 6 and are therefore not
37

discussed in depth. This methodology for allotting dwelling performance characteristics to Designs 2 through 5 was chosen since an in-depth study of likely combinations of design parameters was not in the research scope. It should be noted that with the exception of SH and DHW system efficiency, design characteristics relating to energy use (e.g. effective envelope RSIs, airtightness, household electricity use) are the same for material/fuel Cases A, B and C. 4.4.1 Envelope Design Characterizing the effect of insulation choice on dwelling life cycle performance is an important model assumption but complicated by the fact that (i) insulations are proprietary products of varying thermal resistance and (ii) insulation type influences a dwelling's infiltration rate. A manufacturer literature review was conducted by Athena [39] which indicates that at present air-based insulants such as cellulose, fiberglass, and rockwool all have similar thermal properties, whereas polyurethane foams are generally twice as resistant. Also, it was noted that many cavity wall products have higher resistances than ceiling products; for these reasons the values presented in Table 4.11 were chosen for the study. Dwelling infiltration rates are a function of not only material/assembly choice, but construction practice and quality. For this reason, and for lack of better information on the topic, it was assumed that insulation choice had no incremental influence on dwelling infiltration rate. Non-insulation envelope elements such as cladding, sheathing, and gypsum wall board were assumed to have a constant thermal resistance, regardless of assembly type. For above-grade wall assemblies, these elements comprise a total of 0.29 RSI, or at most 9% of the effective thermal resistance. Design 1: Table 4.12 presents the thermal characteristics for Design 1. Since no data on actual "average" current construction practice was found, these design parameters reflect minimum OBC requirements. Envelope thermal resistances were assigned according to the prescriptive requirements of clause 12.3.2.1 of the OBC. For simplicity, it was assumed that all dwellings are located in cities below 5,000 HDD and no additional envelope insulation was considered for electric SH. Windows and patio doors
38

`

are double glazed with low e coating and have an effective resistance of 0.5 RSI, in accordance with clause 12.3.2.6 of the OBC. Window frame thermal resistance is based on typical RSI values noted in the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) software [61] and material type was assumed not to influence thermal performance. Analysis of other provincial minimum envelope design requirements was not in the research scope. Design 1 has 150mm stud walls with cavity insulation, reflecting the most common wall type currently constructed. Cavity wall insulation material use rates are proportioned according to Table 4.11 in quantities that provide effective envelope assembly thermal resistances according to Table 4.12. Design 1 dwellings have an infiltration rate of 3.0, a value in general agreement with [24], [62] for current construction. Table 4.11: Thermal Resistance (RSI/m) of Insulation

Design 6: Five of the CMHC EQuilibrium initiative dwellings were analyzed in order to assess current Canadian advanced envelope design. With the exception of glazing the Design 6 envelope performance for each component was determined by averaging
39

effective thermal resistance of the five designs. Window performance was assumed to be the best performing Energy Star [63] triple glazed unit available (at time of inquiry). Finally, the Passivehaus low energy building standard [64] requirement for airtightness of 0.6 ACH @50Pa was adopted for Design 6 since there have been a significant number of dwellings built to this criterion since the standard's inception. A summary of the envelope design characteristics for material/fuel Cases A and C are provided in Table 4.13. Case B envelopes are similar to Case A, but with the material mix noted in Section 4.3.1. 4.4.2 Space Heating and Domestic Hot Water System Efficiencies Design 1: the Design 1 SH equipment efficiencies noted in Table 4.14 are the minimum annual fuel utilization efficiencies (AFUE) prescribed by the Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE) Energy Efficiency Regulations (EER) [65]. Wood furnaces in Canada are currently not required to have a minimum AFUE but the Canadian Standard Association (CSA) has adopted a standard (CSA B415.1-00 - Performance Testing of Solid-FuelBurning Heating Appliances) which recommends particulate emissions limits. An American study has found [66] that this performance criterion corresponds to an AFUE of roughly 50%, or that of a conventional wood furnace. The Baseline heat pump has a heat season performance factor (HSPF) is 6.7 according to [67]. Unit energy factors (EF) for each type of DHW system were assessed based on minimum EER requirements. For natural gas and oil tanks the minimum EFs are 0.67 Â­ 0.0005V and 0.59 Â­ 0.0005V, respectively, where V is the tank volume in liters. Minimum EER requirements for electric tanks are based on maximum standby loss. In order to estimate an appropriate EF for the Baseline the minimum EF required by the US Department of Energy was used. The minimum EF is 0.97 - (0.00132*VG), where VG is the tank volume in gallons. No insulation blanket is assumed for Design 1 tanks.

Design 6: Table 4.14 also presents Design 6 efficiencies for SH and DHW systems. AFUE for natural gas, propane and oil SH systems, as well as central air-conditioning unit SEER were assumed to be the best performing Energy Star appliances currently available. Heat pump HSPF is 8.6, taken from [67] and wood furnace AFUE for Design 6 is assumed to be as per the best performing wood stove from [68]. Energy factors for electric and natural gas DHW tanks are assumed to be the best performing systems noted in [58], whereas the oil DHW tank EF factor was assumed to be the best performing product available from the Air-conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute's (AHRI) product database [69]. All DHW tanks have a 2.0 RSI insulation blanket, whereas Designs 2 through 5 have insulation between 0.4 and 1.6 RSI. Table 4.14: Space Heating and DHW Efficiencies

4.4.3 Space Cooling Efficiencies and Use Rates In order to simplify modeling the only type of SC considered in the research are central air-conditioners. These units currently account for 61% of existing SC units in Canada [3]. Without proper data on SC use rates those of the existing stock had to be used. Use rates per dwelling were determined from PCEUD Tables 27 by adding central and window unit rates. The window unit stock was divided by the average number of window units (1.24) per dwelling calculated from SHEU Table 4.3 in order to get the equivalent
42

central unit stock rate per dwelling. Linear regression then was performed on total SC stock from PCEUD Tables 27 for the years 1990-2007, revealing that use rates have increased dramatically in each province. It was therefore decided that this phenomena was to be accounted for within the six designs. Design 1: the regression trend line was extrapolated to the year 2010 to the determine Baseline stock rates. Design 1 air-conditioners are assumed to have a seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) of 13, according to minimum energy efficiency regulations [67].

Province

Design 6: the regression trend line was extrapolated to the year 2049 to determine the Design 6 stock rates. Certain provinces reach their market saturation point (i.e. 100% of homes have an A/C unit) before 2049, as reflected in Table 4.15. It was assumed that Design 6 air-conditioners have a SEER of 24.5, according to the best performing Energy Star appliance. 4.4.4 Appliance Energy Consumption For the purpose of determining electricity consumption, appliances were subdivided into major and minor types. Major appliances include refrigerators and freezers, stoves,

43

washing machines and dryers, and dishwashers. Minor appliances are all other appliances common to homes such as computers, televisions, and hair dryers. Design 1: existing stock data for major appliances was deemed inappropriate for characterizing the Baseline design as (i) energy intensities of these products have significantly dropped over the past 30 years and (ii) service lives tend to be long (9 to 15 years[70]). Table 38 of NRCan's Canadian Comprehensive Energy Use Database (CCEUD) [3] notes new average unit energy consumption (UEC) rates for each major appliance at the national scale. These UECs were multiplied by provincial per dwelling stock rates (i.e. number of each type of appliance per dwelling) from PCEUD Tables 31 to arrive at final household energy intensity. Minor appliances generally have shorter service lives and quicker penetration rates into the existing stock. This is exemplified by the near doubling of energy intensity for these components during the period 1990-2007 in Canada as new products came into the market. For this reason it was deemed acceptable to use existing stock energy intensity data for the Baseline case. Rolled up minor appliance energy intensities for each province were assembled from PCEUD Tables 13. Data for appliances is only available for the residential sector so the influence of dwelling type is not accounted for. A summary of electricity and natural gas appliance use by province, normalized to kWh/day, is provided in Table 4.16. Design 6: a linear regression analysis of the average energy use for new major appliances for the years 1990-2007 from CCEUD Table 38 reveals that each type of appliance underwent different rates of energy efficiency improvement. When energy intensities were extrapolated into the future at the same rate, most appliance energy intensities became zero prior to 2049 (the study end year). It was therefore concluded that energy efficiency improvements could not continue at the same pace. Instead, it was assumed that major appliances could at least improve as much as the percent difference between best and worst Energy Star qualified products. Since many major appliances come in different sizes (and hence different energy use ratings), when appropriate, Energy Star energy use values were normalized to product volume (e.g. refrigerator volume) prior to computing the percent difference. Percent reductions with respect to Design 1 are 42% for refrigerators, 47% for freezers, 52% for dishwashers,
44

75% for clothes washers, 29% for clothes dryers and 13% for ranges. No energy efficiency improvements were assumed for natural gas dryers and ranges since there was no improvement according to CCEUD Table 38 for the years 1996-2007. A similar linear regression analysis of minor appliance energy consumption for the years 1990-2007 (CCEUD Table 18) shows that this energy use has increased dramatically, nearly doubling during the period. For this reason, minor appliance use was assumed to increase but not at current rates. Instead, the study follows the same 20 year forecast as [48], namely that television and peripherals, and computers and peripherals energy use increase 162 and 170 kWh/year, respectively. A summary of electricity and natural gas appliance use by province, normalized to kWh/day, is provided in Table 4.17. 4.4.5 Lighting Energy Consumption Design 1: PCEUD Tables 3 present provincial lighting electricity use for the residential sector. Per dwelling lighting intensities were calculated by taking a five year average (2003-2007) as there were significant irregularities in yearly energy use. While using the existing stock to estimate Baseline lighting use is not ideal, it is assumed that much of the current lighting technology usage, such as compact fluorescent bulb use rates, is reflected in the existing stock since they can be used in existing lighting fixtures. In order to account for the fact that larger dwellings are likely to have more lighting, overall energy use was first normalized on a provincial per m2 floor area basis and then multiplied by the floor area of each archetype considered. The resulting lighting energy intensities are shown in Table 4.18, normalized to kWh/dwelling/day. Design 6: no source of information on future lighting energy was found and a detailed analysis of lighting penetration rates and possible reduction was within the scope of the research. Lighting was assumed to decrease at an annual rate of 0.2% as per [71] over the 40-year study period. Design 6 was assigned the resulting lighting energy use, as presented in Table 4.19.

4.4.6 Hot Water Use Design 1: daily hot water use rates were determined from the default equation of HOT2000 with household sizes from Table 4.2: Hot Water (Liters/Day) = 85 + 35 * (number of occupants in the house) The resulting hot water use rates for each province are presented in Table 4.20.

Design 6: a detailed analysis was required in order to estimate hot water reduction potential for Design 6. First, municipal per capita water use from Environment Canada's 2010 Municipal Water Use Report [72] was disaggregated into end uses according to [73]. The percent of hot water was then estimated for each end use. Showers and baths are assumed to be 88% hot water according to [74], dish washer are 100% and other domestic, leaks, and faucet 40% according to DeOreo and Mayer [60]. The clothes washer was then allotted the remaining hot water not accounted for. Percent reduction of hot water was evaluated for each end use. Showerhead flow rate were assumed to go from 17.1 liters per minute (lpm) flow rate to 9.5 lpm, and faucet flow rates assumed to go from 13.5 to 6 lpm according to [75]. Clothes washer and dish washer water reduction was estimated by calculating the percent difference between best and poorest performing Energy Star products. Finally, it is assumed that 50% of hot water use from
48

leakage is fixed and no hot water reduction assumed for other domestic and baths. These initiatives together account for a 49% reduction in hot water use for Design 6. Table 4.21 summarizes the assumptions described above and Table 4.22 shows the resulting Design 6 hot water use rates. Table 4.21: Hot Water Analysis Assumptions

4.4.7 Air Tightness and Mechanical Ventilation All dwellings in the research have mechanical ventilation in accordance with Clause 9.32.1.2 of the OBC. The ventilation rates for detached and attached (i.e. semidetached, row) archetypes are 60L/s and 55 L/s in conformance with clause 9.32.33; size of dwelling does not affect the ventilation rate since each archetype has the same number rooms. Design 1: Clauses 9.32.3.6 and 9.32.37 stipulate that dwellings must have a heat recovery ventilator if the heating source is a solid fuel (i.e. wood) or if there is no forced air system (i.e. boilers and electric baseboard), respectively. An analysis of Baseline HVAC use reveals that these systems represent approximately 43% of the existing stock; in order to simplify modeling, an HRV with 55% efficiency is considered for all Baseline designs in accordance with clause 9.32.3.11. of the OBC. Design 6: the HRV for Design 6 is 80% efficient, in accordance with the best performing Energy Star unit. 4.5 Energy Simulation All energy simulations were carried out with the program HOT2000 V10.51 [24]. Since here is no difference in effective resistance for envelope components between material/fuel cases A, B, and C, the number of total simulation files was reduced by a third to 6,264. All SH and DHW systems considered in scope were simulated for each file, resulting in 10 separate computations per file. Creation of each HOT2000 file and execution and storage of output was made possible with a keyboard macro recorder. HOT2000 has long term weather files for 30 of the 36 locations considered in the research scope; six new files therefore had to be created. For these cities weather data was estimated from the closest available city, substituting heating degree day, latitude and average dry bulb monthly temperatures from Environment Canada [53] and calculating monthly wet bulb temperatures using wet bulb depressions from the surrogate city. This methodology for estimating an annual weather profile is as per correspondence with Brian Bradley of NRCan [76]. Each simulation was assumed to
50

have an indoor set point temperature of 21ÂºC and cooling set point of 25ÂºC. All HVAC equipment was sized by HOT2000 according to programs defaults. 4.6 Construction Forecast A 40-year time frame was chosen for the research in order to place results within the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recommendation of an 80-95% reduction in GWP by 2050 for industrialized countries [77]. Allowing sufficient time to analyze maintenance stage effects was also valued. A literature review was conducted to find a suitable long term housing construction demand forecast through 2050. While there are publically available 20-year [78] and 25-year [79] forecasts, no forecast could be found for construction through 2050. A more simple approach was therefore taken to estimate the degree of construction that could take place in the study period. A constant growth rate was assumed based on average annual demand during the period 1999-2009 from [50]. This was deemed acceptable since the objective of the research is to provide a framework to analyze Canadian construction rather than provide accurate forecasts. Annual construction includes 105,801 single detached, 12,605 semi-detached, and 18,320 row units. Over period 1999-2009, these completions represented 73.1% of all residential construction, with the remaining 26.9% being apartment dwellings. The housing totals were apportioned to the 36 locations considered (see Section 4.1) according to the 2009 distribution of construction in 59 urban areas from [50]. Since row buildings were assumed to be comprised of 5 units [48], 2/5 of these units were assigned as semi-detached. This reflects the fact that the end units of row housing have similar thermal and material use characteristics. Table 4.23 summarizes the resulting annual housing completions, by dwelling type and location. After 40 years of construction 4,232,048 detached, 504,201 semi-detached and 732,802 row housing units are constructed. These 5,469,051 dwellings will represent a significant share of the dwelling stock in 2050. According to the CEUD tables in 2007 the existing non-apartment building stock was 8,947,000 units. An analysis of the tables reveals that between 1997-2007 approximately 56,500 dwellings on average were

demolished each year. If this rate is assumed constant over the next 40 years, new construction post 2010 would represent 45% of the existing stock by 2050 according to the forecast assumed. Table 4.23: Annual Dwelling Completions1

4.7 LCA Data 4.7.1 Envelope Materials Envelope materials/assemblies common to residential construction but currently not in the EIE database include weeping tile, dimpled waterproof membrane, slate roofing, cedar shake/shingles, exterior insulated finishing systems (EIFS), and fiberglass window frames. These building products were deemed worthy of inclusion in the research scope and therefore LCA data was assessed for each. Weeping tile and dimpled waterproof membranes are both made of high density polystyrene (HDPE) and undergo an extrusion process during manufacture. Quantities of HDPE per functional unit of product were estimated from product manufacturer literature [80] and [81]. These quantities were then modeled at the national scale in the proprietary LCA software SimaPro [82] with data from the US LCI [83] and Ecoinvent [84] databases. Transportation is assumed to be via truck in accordance with average haul distance data from Statistic Canada [85]. Slate roofing assembly quantities were calculated with information from the National Federation of Roofing Contractors (NFRC) [86] and cedar roofing quantities determined with information from the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau [87]. Ancillary materials and roofing felt data are as per the EIE database. Slate roofing tile and cedar shingle/shake profiles were estimated by proportioning by weight and functional units EIE data for natural stone and cedar bevel siding, respectively. Constituent EIFS material quantities were provided by the Athena Institute and the final LCA profile for the assembly was calculated by adding EIE data of each material. The EIFS profile therefore does not include the effects of manufacturing the wall assembly at plant. Finally, a national scale fiberglass window frame profile was developed from data provided by the Athena Institute modeled in SimaPro. 4.7.2 Building Service Systems In an effort to capture more of the embodied effects of residential construction, a database of electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and DHW systems (i.e. building service equipment) was developed in SimaPro. The Athena Institute has since drawn on the

53

database for use in whole building analysis studies [35, 39]; a brief description of data sources and assumptions follows. Since there is currently no available data on manufacturing these products, estimates are meant to reflect average national practice. Building service equipment is generally any combination of steel, aluminum, copper, and plastics. Steel and aluminum LCI data is from the Athena database and plastics from the US LCI database. North American primary copper data comes from the Ecoinvent LCI database. All copper used in the products is assumed to be primary; for electrical wire this assumption is valid, as primary copper is required for good conductivity [88]. One source estimates that over 2/3 of copper pipe is recycled content [89]. While this will significantly change the environmental profile, further research is beyond scope. Manufacturing process data for service equipment products are also from the Ecoinvent database. Since the data is European in scope, each process was altered to reflect Canadian fuel combustion, electricity generation and in some cases, material production (e.g. lubricating oil). All transportation was assumed to be by truck, with average shipping distances estimated from [85]. There are 10 types of electrical wire considered: Â· Â· Â· 14/2,14/3, 12/2, 10/3, and 8/3 NMD90 wire 6, 3, and 00 AWG bare wire 3 and 00 AWG R90 insulated conductor wire

Reference [90] provides copper cross sectional areas for each gauge. This was used to calculate total copper wire weight per unit length for each of the ten electrical wires considered. These copper quantities undergo a wire drawing process to become copper wire. Insulation quantities for each wire type were determined by subtracting copper weights from total wire weights noted in [90]. A bill of materials (BOM) for typical non metallic (NM) insulation is given in [91]; this information was used to estimate the material effects and a plastic extrusion process was used as a proxy for insulation extrusion. Galvanized sheet metal electrical boxes for receptacles, switches, and lighting were also evaluated, based on unit weights from [92].
54

The following pipes are considered in the research: Â· Â· Â· 13mm and 19mm type L copper water supply pipe 40mm, 50mm. 75mm, 100mm ABS drain, waste, and vent pipe 40mm PVC electrical conduit pipe

Unit weights for copper pipes are taken from [58] and undergo an extrusion process. A report on plastic pipes [93] provided the life cycle inventory (LCI) data required for ABS and PVC pipes. The data is rolled up to plant gate and therefore include all material and manufacturing (e.g. plastic extrusion) processes. The data is presented on the basis of specific pipe sizes and therefore data was normalized on a per kg basis prior to being input in SimaPro. Unit weights for each size of pipe taken from [58] were used to determine effects for the various sizes. The following HVAC and DHW components are considered, along with the source for the BOM: Â· Â· Â· DHW tank, HRV unit, natural gas furnace [33] Natural gas boiler, central air-conditioner, heat pump, radiators [32] Baseboard heaters [94]

Each component is a mixture of various metals and plastics. Since none of the sources provided any detail as to the type of product each material was, manufacturing processes allotted to materials were based on a best guess. For example, any quantities labeled galvanized steel were assumed to be sheet, copper quantities (when in small amounts) were assumed to be wire, etc. DHW tanks, furnaces, and boilers were assumed to be the same for each fuel type as specific bills of materials could not be found. No BOM was found for electric baseboard heating units. The LCA data for these units is based on average total weight (per W of output) from product literature, assuming an 80%/20% mix of steel to aluminum plate.

4.7.3 Wood Combustion A wood combustion profile (including resource harvesting) for Canada was estimated by adjusting European Ecoinvent data; for the purpose of this research, combustion is assumed to be carbon neutral according to [95].

5.0 RESIDENTIAL BATCH ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT TOOL (Res-BEAT) LCA is a powerful tool for building designers and policymakers because it can provide a significant amount of information to the practitioner, whether that be life cycle impact or resource use results, or secondary energy or material use quantities. Yet its data, calculation and results intensiveness can make it difficult to apply in practice. No truer is this for research such as this where more than one dwelling case is considered. One of the most important aspects of this work was therefore to come up with a platform to be able to store data, perform calculations, and display results based on queries. A Microsoft Excel based program with this capacity called the Residential Batch Environmental Assessment Tool (or Res-BEAT) was developed by the author in collaboration with the Athena Sustainable Materials Institute. Res-BEAT is the first program specifically designed to conduct batch dwelling LCA and bottom-up engineered LCA building stock modeling. 5.1 Program Structure The program comprises databases of design and LCA information, and input and user forms to prompt which analysis is desired. This database structure facilitates updates and evolution of the program to include new dwelling design descriptions, material types, and technologies. The program structure of Res-BEAT is shown in Figure 5.1; an explanation of each module follows. LCA Data: this module is where region-specific LCA data for materials and fuels are stored. The program primarily draws on data comprising the Athena Impact Estimator software, as well as other databases maintained by the Athena Institute. As new LCA data emerges in the future, the program can be easily updated. Building Material Takeoffs/Annual Operating Fuel Use: these two modules are where dwelling design information is stored. This information includes building material and service equipment takeoff quantities (e.g. 20m3 of lumber, 1 hot water tank) from the Residential Archetype Materials Calculator, as well as annual operating energy use results (e.g. 20,000kWh electricity for space heating, 600m3 natural gas for domestic

57

water heating) from HOT2000. If the user wishes to add a new design to the program, material and fuel quantities are added here. Figure 5.1: Res-BEAT Program Structure

Building Stock Impact Estimator: this worksheet is the input interface where a building stock is created and results are displayed. Figure C2 of Appendix C shows the input table where a building stock is defined. The first four columns labeled "archetype", "design", "province", and "city" identify which dwelling design the user wants to add to the stock (see Section 3.3 for description). These parameters are used to call on material and fuel take-off data. The "service life" column defines the service life of the respective dwelling design and serves to tell the program when to initiate end of life effects and terminate annual operating energy effects. The final section of the input form is where the number of dwelling completions, for each design and for each
58

year of the model period is allocated. For example, if the user wants to add 500 units of a certain design to the stock in 2025, 500 is input in the appropriate cell. The buttons labeled "Clear Input" and "Reset Worksheet" clears the input table and allows the user to start a new analysis. The "Execute Analysis" button opens a user form where the locations, designs, and results to be calculated are selected. From the user form a button begins execution of analysis by way of a macro. The macro loops through the housing start data (i.e. the user input) of the first year, calculates the appropriate material and fuel quantities via the four design identifiers, and then multiplies these quantities by the LCA data to get final results. Once results for the first year are finished the macro loops to the next year and performs the same routine. After passing through each year of the model, the building stock analysis is complete. Batch Dwelling Impact Estimator: this worksheet form allows the user to select designs from the database for batch LCA analysis. Results are calculated in a similar way to the Building Stock Impact Estimator. 5.2 Results and Uses The program currently contains information for 29 archetypes, 36 cities, 3 material/fuel cases, and 6 energy designs, allowing for batch analysis or building stock modeling with over 18,000 dwelling options. Res-BEAT calculates the following results, which are similar to those calculated by the Athena Impact Estimator: Â· 8 impact measures Ex: kg CO2 eq. global warming potential, kg NOx eq. smog potential Â· 30 raw resource uses Ex: MJ total primary energy (TPE), m3 wood, kg limestone, litres crude oil Â· Bill of materials Â­ 110 building and 38 service equipment products Ex: m3 small dimension lumber, m2 brick veneer, m 13mm copper pipe Â· Operating (i.e. secondary) energy use Ex: kWh electricity, m3 natural gas, litres of diesel

59

Building stock results are presented as both dynamic (i.e. as a function of time) and static, whereas batch dwelling results are static only. Building stock modeling can be applied at various scales, including national, provincial, municipal or community levels. Given the many types of results and scales available to the user, the program can be put to various uses, some of which are outlined below: Product Research: with this program the influence of a particular building product on the building sector can be investigated. Examples include the increased use of wood products and renewable energy systems (i.e. photovoltaic arrays). Housing Developments: the majority of new homes are constructed in large housing developments. Conducting LCAs at this scale is an arduous and costly task; with a platform to do this analysis quickly based on archetypes, developers could use LCA to help make more informed design decisions. Urban Planning: by modeling building stocks with various dwelling types and densities, urban planners could better understand the impact of their decisions at the community level. Policy Development: LCA is a tool that aims to predict all the effects associated with an end-use. Building stock modeling according to LCA provides an effective means to analyze any number of proposed incentive programs, subsidies or taxes. Building Code Development and Analysis: building code development would be well served by an analysis that considers the holistic nature of building performance and provides a dynamic assessment based on more than operating energy consumption. Energy Analysis: for typical energy end-use modeling why not generate a more complete environmental profile using LCA? Since the building sector is a significant consumer of electricity, stock modeling also provides a useful tool to understand the relationship between consumption and the effect of changes to electricity generation mixes.

6.0 RESULTS 6.1 Introduction The following section presents a sample of Res-BEAT dwelling and building stock output. Section 6.2 looks at Baseline results in detail followed by sensitivity analysis of material and fuel choice (Section 6.3), and energy efficiency implications (Section 6.4). Section 6.5 then explores the absolute upper and lower bounds of GWP within the research scope. Results are presented in graphical form in order to highlight findings, whereas tables with the associated data are found in Appendix B. The analysis focuses on the variation of effects by location, design, etc., rather than the environmental implications of the effects. GWP is the primary metric for analysis and is therefore analyzed with the most detail. Detailed graphs for TPE are given in the Appendices but are generally not discussed. Normalized impact indicators and resource use graphs accompany each section for the purpose of highlighting the breadth of Res-BEAT analysis and basic environmental profile characteristics in a concise manner. All whole dwelling results presented are static, based on an assumed service life of 60 years. Unless otherwise noted, dwelling results are given for 10 cities across Canada, representing the largest cities of each province. All building stocks considered are 40 years of construction (2010-2049) at the national scale as per the demand forecast outlined in Section 4.6. It is assumed that the service life of constituent dwellings is greater than 40 years and therefore no end of life is considered. The building stock results presented are both static and dynamic. As previously noted, Res-BEAT calculates results based on database information at the dwelling scale. The database dwellings are therefore the basis for both batch assessments or building stock modeling. Figures 6.1 and 6.2 show 60 year dwelling database embodied and operating energy GWP results in Toronto for material/fuel Case B and energy Design 1, for each of the 29 archetypes considered. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 show the size of each archetype considered.

61

Observed Trends - GWP of Toronto Database Dwellings Â· Â· Â· The manufacturing stage dominates embodied emissions, contributing 59-62%. SH represents 45-64% of operating energy GWP. Embodied GWP is generally 9-10% of total life cycle impact for the 60 year service life, or 6-7 years of annual operating effects. Â· For both embodied and operating energy effects, row and semi-detached housing perform better than detached housing since material usage and energy consumption is reduced due to shared party walls. For instance, archetypes R6 and S6 (150m2 floor area) are responsible for 88% and 71% the GWP of D1 (150m2 floor area), respectively. These differences can be traced primarily to SH demand. Â· Between smallest and largest dwelling sizes total GWP increases by 23-27%, illustrating the degree to which dwelling size influences impact. Â· Embodied effects increase more on a percent basis than operating effects since dwelling size not only affects the quantity of materials, but in the case of structure, the size and type of members due to increased floor and roof spans.

6.2 Baseline The "Baseline" refers to material/fuel Case B and energy Design 1, thereby representing current minimum construction practice and typical occupant behavior. As previously noted, each archetype in Case B is allotted the average materials mix and SH and DHW stock distributions noted in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, and therefore represent not a specific design, but an average one. All results for the baseline and subsequent Sections (6.3- 6.5) are based on the provincial archetypes presented in Table 4.3. 6.2.1 Dwelling Scale Figures 6.3 to 6.5 show annual SE simulation results for the Baseline archetypes in 10 cities. Row and semi-detached units require less energy to operate, between 55-63% and 71-82% that of detached units, respectively. Due to Canada's cold climate, SH is the largest contributor to SE, comprising 61-78%, 54-72%, and 41-65% of total SE for detached, semi-detached, and row housing, respectively. SH energy use is primarily a function of climate and heating system efficiency. For example, there is almost a threefold increase in SH use between Vancouver and Saskatoon due to differences in HDD (2925 vs. 5950 [24]) and the fact that British Columbia has a higher percentage of
63

electric heating systems (100% efficient) compared to Saskatchewan. Figure 6.5 illustrates the differences in fuel use across Canada, in particular the use of (i) natural gas in western provinces, (ii) heating oil in eastern provinces, and (iii) generally higher rates of electricity in provinces with significant hydroelectric generation. Life cycle building material usage varies according to the size of dwelling assumed for each province and dwelling type. BOM results for Toronto Baseline detached, semidetached, and row unit s are presented in Table B8 of Appendix B. Figure 6.3: Baseline Dwelling Annual SE, by dwelling type

Figure 6.6 presents Baseline GWP for row, semi-detached, and detached housing in 10 cities across Canada. In order to illustrate the difference in GWP results between typical and LCA methodologies, detached housing emissions have been disaggregated into three components in Figure 6.7: embodied emissions, and operating energy stage emissions from site combustion and electricity generation (OE1), and emissions related to pre-combustion (OE2). Typical GWP analysis only accounts for GWP emissions from site combustion and electricity generation (OE1); OE2 effects are those related to the production and transport of SE. Figures 6.8 and 6.9 show detached operating energy and embodied results by end-use and life cycle stage, respectively, in order to provide further insight into the source of emissions. Observed Trends - Baseline Dwelling GWP Â· Dwelling type has a significant influence on life cycle GWP; row and semidetached designs emit 54-71% and 70-81% that of detached dwellings, respectively. GWP reductions are less than corresponding SE reductions. Â· SH contributes most to GWP, 36-60% for row, 45-68% for semi-detached, and 50-71% for detached. Â· SC is currently not a large contributor to GWP as it is responsible for less than 4% of emissions for all dwelling types. Â· Total emissions across cities vary considerably, 88-915 tonnes for row, 1161,098 tonnes for semi-detached and 152-1,340 tonnes for detached housing. The lowest emissions are in Montreal and the highest in Halifax. Â· The percent embodied emissions is 5-39% for row, 4-33% for semi-detached, and 5-32% for detached housing. The lowest percent is in Halifax and the highest in Montreal. Â· Pre-combustion (OE2) of detached dwellings is 11-19% of operating energy stage GWP. Â· EE and OE2 are the value added of conducting analysis according to LCA; together they are responsible for 17-47% of detached emissions. In other words, LCA analysis accounts for 1.2 to 1.9 times the impact as typical analysis.

66

Â·

Detached operating energy emissions across cities vary by a factor of over 12. This large difference is particularly influenced by provincial electricity generation mix and SH and DHW system distribution.

Â·

Detached embodied emissions across cities vary by a factor of 1.3, much less than the operating energy stage. This result is due to variations in dwelling size and the fact that the Case B materials use mix does not vary by province as fuel use mix does. Differences in AL-related effects across the ten detached designs illustrate the concept of how not all fuels are created equal. These electricity related emissions vary between 2.2 tonnes in Montreal to 344 tonnes in Halifax.

Â·

In general, Dwellings in Montreal are low impact because: (i) (ii) Quebec electricity generation is very low in GWP. Quebec dwellings rely heavily on electricity for SH and DHW.

Dwellings Halifax are high impact because: (i) (ii) Nova Scotia electricity generation is primarily coal based. Nova Scotia dwellings rely heavily on heating oil and electricity for SH and DHW. Emissions from the Calgary and Saskatoon dwellings would be of similar or greater magnitude if not for the dominance of natural gas for SH and DHW in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Figure 6.10 presents 7 normalized impact indicator results for the Toronto Baseline detached dwelling, by stage. With the exception of eutrophication, ozone depletion and solid waste, SH generally contributes most to impacts, between 37-56%. Refrigerant used in heat pumps and air conditioners is responsible for the majority of ozone depletion potential, which is why manufacturing and maintenance stages contribute nearly 100% of emissions. Solid waste predominantly comes from demolition and disposal in the end of life stage (59%). Embodied stages together contribute 13%, 26%, 92% and 28% to acidification, human health (HH) respiratory effects, eutrophication and smog, respectively. Figure 6.11 shows normalized life cycle energy resource use for the same detached dwelling in Toronto. Over the course of 60 years, this dwelling consumes 15,930 GJ of TPE (295 kWh/m2/yr), 89,469 kg of coal, 27,074 liters of crude oil, 166,607 m3 of natural gas, 15 kg of uranium, 47 tonnes of wood, and 772 GJ of RPE. Similar to impact indicators, SH is generally responsible for the most resource use, between 36% and 67%. Embodied resource use is 6-7% for coal, natural gas, and RPE, 1% for uranium whereas it accounts for 32% and 60% of crude oil and wood consumption, respectively. 33% of embodied crude oil use is for feedstock purposes in plastic and bitumen based building materials. Graphs for Montreal and Calgary similar to Figures 6.10 and 6.11 are included in Appendix A to illustrate the influence of location on impact and resource use characteristics. In particular, these graphs show how hydroelectric and coal dominated electricity generation influence environmental profiles in Quebec and Alberta, respectively.

6.2.2 Building Stock Scale Accumulated Baseline building stock inputs SE and BOM are given in Appendix B Tables B6 and B11, respectively. Figure 6.12 presents dynamic Baseline annual GWP emissions for Canada with the same components (EE, OE1, and OE2) considered in Figure 6.8 for dwellings. Figure 6.13 then presents the corresponding dynamic Baseline accumulative GWP; the percent contribution of each component is plotted over time in Figure 6.14. Finally, 40year national GWP is plotted by province in Figure 6.15. Observed Trends Â­ Baseline Building Stock GWP Â· By 2050, annual GWP due to post 2010 construction is 54.1 Mt CO2 eq. This represents 7% of the estimated 747Mt GWP emissions in Canada in 2007 [4]. Â· Â· Pre-combustion (OE2) accounts for 17% of operating energy stage GWP. Annual embodied emissions are 5.10 Mt CO2 eq. in 2010 and rise to 6.46 Mt by 2049 due to maintenance and replacement effects (i.e. recurring embodied). Â· By 2049, annual OE1 and OE2 rise to 39.5Mt and 8.2Mt, respectively. OE1 and OE2 overtake embodied in 2015 and 2038, respectively. Â· After 40 years, new construction is responsible for 1,201Mt of GWP, with 809Mt, 168Mt, and 224Mt accounted for by OE1, OE2, and embodied, respectively. OE1 overtakes accumulated embodied in 2019. Â· In 2010 the embodied component is 81% and reduces to 19% after 40 years. This phenomenon is the consequence of the high emissions from manufacturing materials and constructing buildings relative to the annual operational emissions of those dwellings at the start of the study period. Â· EE and OE2 impacts together account for 84% in 2010 and 33% in 2049 of total accumulated GWP. After 40 years the GWP accounted for by the LCA building stock model is 1.5 times that of typical energy end-use modeling. Â· After 40 years, Ontario and Alberta together are responsible for 73% of total emissions and all other provinces contribute each less than 6%. The driving factors for this are (i) the number of dwellings constructed in Ontario and Alberta,
72

(ii) the high GWP intensities of dwellings constructed in Alberta and (iii) the low GWP intensities of dwellings constructed in British Columbia and Quebec. Â· Provincial percent embodied GWP ranges from 10% in Nova Scotia to as high as 51% in Quebec. Figure 6.12: Baseline Stock GWP

Normalized static building stock impact indicator results are presented in Figure 6.16 and resource use in Figure 6.17, by life cycle stage. With the exception of eutrophication, ozone depletion and solid waste, SH is a significant contributor to impacts, accounting for between 29% and 48% of total effects. Embodied effects together contribute 96% of eutrophication, 100% of ozone depletion, 69% of solid waste and between 19% and 44% of other impacts. SC accounts for less than 3% to any impact. With the exception of eutrophication and ozone depletion, DHW and AL account for 2.3-11.2% and 15-21% of effects, respectively. In 2049 the Baseline building stock is predicted to consume 1,094 PJ of NRPE and 175 PJ of RPE, or 1,270 PJ TPE. This is equivalent to 10% of the estimated 12,786 PJ TPE consumed in Canada in 2007 [96]. Forty years of building stock TPE use amounts to 27,538 PJ. Over the course of 40 years the building stock is predicted to consume approximately 190,000 Mt of coal, 82 ML of crude oil, 270,000 Mm3 of natural gas, 12
75

Mt of uranium, and 175 Mt of wood. Again, SH is generally the leading contributor to resource use, responsible for 27-62% of consumption. Embodied stages account for significant crude oil (36%) and wood (73%) due to feedstock use, and lesser contributions to coal and natural gas, at 10% and 14%, respectively. DHW contributes most to natural gas (17%) and RPE (12%) use due to the domination of these sources as heating fuel. Finally, AL accounts for significant coal, uranium, and RPE (29-47%), fuels generally used exclusively for electricity generation. Figure 6.18 illustrates that provincial contributions to other impact indicators are of a similar order of magnitude as GWP; one exception to this is ozone depletion due to the high percentage of air conditioning use in Ontario. The relationship between provincial SH and DHW stock distribution, electricity generation mix, and energy resource use is illustrated Figure 6.19. Provinces with coal fired electricity generation such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia show the most significant use of this resource. A similar observation can be made with respect to those provinces that have significant hydroelectric generation (RPE), which include British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Newfoundland. Ontario dominates uranium consumption (91%) due to its high construction rate and use of nuclear generated electricity. Despite low construction rates in Atlantic Canada, these provinces consume 31% of crude oil as a result of reliance on heating oil for SH and DHW. In contrast, Atlantic Provinces are responsible for only 1.9% of natural gas consumption.

6.3 Sensitivity to Material and Fuel Choice This section presents results for material/fuel Cases A and C, or the best and worst performing combinations with respect to GWP, as outlined in Section 4.3. All dwellings and building stocks are Design 1 energy performance. The Baseline refers to material/fuel mix Case B and is the same as presented in Section 6.2. The extent of GWP between Case A and Case C represents the range that can be expected for any design currently constructed to Design 1 energy performance standards.

6.3.1 Dwelling Scale A comparison of detached dwelling annual SE for the Baseline, Case A and Case C is shown in Figure 6.20. The results illustrate that reductions in GWP from fuel choice do not necessarily translate to reductions in SE on a per-Joule basis. Case A and C annual SE is further broken down by fuel type in Figures 6.20 and 6.21. Case A fuel use is primarily electricity in provinces with clean electric generation and natural gas in provinces dominated by fossil fuel electric generation. In contrast, Case C fuel use is primarily heating oil in provinces with clean electric generation and electricity in
79

provinces dominated by fossil fuel electric generation. The resulting BOM for each case in Toronto is presented in Table B8 of Appendix B. Figure 6.21: Detached Dwelling Material/Fuel Use Case A Annual SE

Figure 6.23 shows the 60 year detached dwelling Baseline GWP for 10 cities including bars depicting the sensitivity with respect to material and fuel choice. A breakdown of the sensitivity by life cycle stage for detached dwellings is provided in Figure 6.24. Observed Trends Â­ Dwelling Material/Fuel Use GWP Sensitivity Â· The extent of dwelling sensitivity is 179-713 tonnes for row, 246-1,013 tonnes for semi-detached and 344-1,373 tonnes for detached housing, or 47-401%, 51415%, and 56-387% of the Baseline, respectively. Â· The total extent of sensitivity is highest in Calgary to lowest in Toronto. These findings generally reflect: (i) the dominance of fuel choice (i.e. operating energy) sensitivity; (ii) the large difference in emissions between electric and natural gas fuelled systems in Alberta; (iii) the small difference in emissions between electric and natural gas fuelled systems in Ontario. Â· Relative to the Baseline there is a 4-21% and 4-78% reduction for Case A embodied and operational effects, respectively. Similarly, there is a 47-68% and 17-333% increase for Case C. Operating energy GWP varies considerably more than embodied GWP.
Â·

With the exception of Moncton, the difference between Baseline and Case C is greater than Baseline and Case A. In other words the Baseline tends to be closer to the best case. Montreal is the best performing Case A detached dwelling at 57 tonnes and Calgary is the poorest performing Case C dwelling at 2,303 tonnes. It can therefore be said that 60-year GWP varies by a factor of at least 40 for dwellings constructed in Canada.

6.3.2 Building Stock Scale Tables B6 and B11 in Appendix B show SE and BOM for Case A and Case C over the 40-year period. This analysis serves to illustrate the degree of secondary resource use by the residential sector in the long term. Figure 6.25 presents annual GWP for the 3 material/fuel choice Cases; the resulting accumulated results are shown in Figure A5 of Appendix A. Figures 6.19 and 6.20 then show the associated annual operating energy and embodied GWP. Observed Trends Â­ Building Stock Material/Fuel Use Sensitivity Â· The extent of sensitivity is 6.5 Mt in 2010 and increases to 59 Mt CO2 eq. in 2049. Â· Case C represents a Â± 82% increase and Case A represents a Â± 25% decrease relative to the Baseline. Similar to the dwelling analysis, the Baseline is closer to the best case. Â· The 2049 range of 41-100 Mt CO2 eq. represents 5.5% to 13% of Canadian emissions in 2007. Â· After forty years the extent of accumulated sensitivity is 1,316 Mt, with Case A responsible for 910 Mt and Case C 2,226 Mt of GWP emissions. The extent of sensitivity is therefore 115 Mt greater than the Baseline emissions. Â· The percent embodied contribution to accumulated GWP is in the same order of magnitude for each case, beginning at 80-87% in 2010 and ending at 17-19% in 2049. Â· All three cases exhibit linearly increasing operating energy impacts (between 0.90 Mt and 2.25 Mt CO2 eq. per year) since dwellings of equal energy performance are added at a constant rate over the 40 year period. Â· Embodied emissions gradually increase as maintenance stage emissions occur over time: (i) The Baseline exhibits many small increases in embodied GWP since its material mix includes various assemblies that are replaced at different times.
83

(ii) Case A shows spikes in embodied effects at 15-16 years due primarily to the beginning of heat pump and window replacement and at 25 years due to cladding and roofing replacement. (iii) Case C sees its most significant increase at 25 years when aluminum windows begin to be replaced in the stock. Â· Over the study period, maintenance effects increase embodied GWP by a factor of 1.4, 1.3, and 1.2 for Case A, the Baseline, and Case C material/fuel choice combinations, respectively. The higher percent increase for Case A can be attributed to the use of wood products with higher replacement rates. Much of the envelope replacement for the Baseline and Case C occur after the 40 years. Figure 6.25: Building Stock Material/Fuel Use GWP Sensitivity

Figure 6.28 presents 40-year impacts for the three material/fuel cases, normalized to the Baseline. It should be noted that for other impact and resource use indicators the sensitivity does not represent best- and worst-cases, but the changes in effects due to the best and worst GWP mixes of materials and fuels. While many of the best/worst mixes may be the same, GWP sensitivity is the largest relative change among indicators, suggesting additional analysis is required to determine the best- and worstcase material/fuel combinations for other indicators. With the exception of eutrophication and ozone depletion, all impact results are higher (25-85%) for Case C and lower for Case A (7-24%); again, the Baseline results are closer to Case A than Case C. Higher ozone depletion for Case A is the result of increased heat pump usage. The effect of material and fuel choice on energy resource use is shown in Figure 6.29. Annual TPE consumption in 2049 is 1,189 PJ for Case A and 1,641 PJ for Case C. The extent of sensitivity for the Baseline in 2049 is therefore 452 PJ, representing a range of 9% to 13% of Canada's TPE consumption in 2007. After 40 years, accumulated TPE is 25,434 PJ and 36,228 PJ for Cases A and C, an 8% decrease and 32% increase relative to the Baseline, respectively. Case C favors high GWP emission fuels such as coal and crude oils, whereas Case A favors low GWP emission fuels such as uranium and RPE. One exception to this is a small increase in coal use for Case A relative to the Baseline. This is a result of the choice of electric SH and DHW systems in Ontario and Manitoba where coal is included in their electricity generation mixes. This increase is greater than coal use reductions in Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia from switching to exclusively natural gas SH and DHW systems. Natural gas use is lower for Case A than the Baseline as a result of (i) the choice of electric systems in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario - provinces that typically use a lot of natural gas, and (ii) the provinces that use exclusively natural gas systems in Case A either already use significant gas (i.e. Alberta, Saskatchewan Baseline), or (iii) are provinces with low levels of construction (i.e. New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island).

6.4 Sensitivity to Energy Efficiency Measures This section provides results for dwellings and building stocks with improved SE performance in accordance with the methodology outlined Section 4.4. All results consider only material/fuel Case B; again, the Baseline herein refers to all dwellings or building stocks of material/fuel Case B and energy Design 1. 6.4.1 Dwelling Scale Figure 6.30 presents annual SE results for Design 6 dwellings, by dwelling type. Reductions with respect to Design 1 are 38-65 GJ/yr ( 53-70% reduction) for row, 49-86 GJ/yr (60-71% reduction) for semi-detached, and 68-128 GJ/yr (65-75% reduction) for detached units. SH is responsible for the majority of energy reduction (65-91%), followed by DHW (8-34%), and AL (0-1%). SC energy use increases between Design 1 and 6, but remains less than 13% of SE for any city. Results by end-use are given for detached dwellings in Figure 6.31; this serves to illustrate the more even balance of household consumption among SH, DHW, and AL. Detached dwelling SE by fuel type follows in Figure 6.32. Electricity is the dominant fuel used in the household mixes, accounting for 45-94% of SE. Relative to the Baseline dwellings, Designs 2 through 6 require ever greater material inputs via envelope improvement for increased energy efficiency. The BOM for these additional inputs is given in Table B9.

Figure 6.33 shows life cycle GWP for Design 6 dwellings for row, semi-detached, and detached housing and Figures 6.34 and 6.35 provide further details for detached units. Observed Trends Â­ Design 6 Dwelling GWP Â· Row and semi-detached designs emit 63-81% and 73-87% that of detached housing, respectively. Design 1 dwellings. Â· The percent SH emissions is 3-23% for row, 8-31% for semi-detached, and 1132% for detached housing. SH contribution to total emissions is reduced for Design 6 dwellings. Â· Â· SC is responsible for less than 11% of emissions for all dwelling types. Total emissions across cities varies 52-524 tonnes for row, 62-571 tonnes for semi-detached and 80-657 tonnes for detached housing. Â· The percent embodied emissions is 9-82% for row, 10-78% for semi-detached, and 11-78% for detached housing.
90

Dwelling type influences GWP less for Design 6 than

Â·

Pre-combustion (OE2) of detached dwellings is 14-20% of operating energy stage GWP. EE and OE2 together are responsible for 24-81% of detached emissions. LCA analysis therefore accounts for 1.3 to 5.3 times the impact as typical analysis. Between Design 1 and Design 6 detached dwellings there is a 72 to 683 tonnes CO2 eq. decrease in GWP, or 43% to 66% reduction. This is the result of a decrease in operating energy GWP of 85-696 tonnes and increase in embodied GWP of 11-14 tonnes CO2 eq.

Â·

Â·

Â·

The additional detached dwelling embodied GWP is equivalent to 1.1 year in Halifax to 9.5 years in Montreal of annual operational GWP savings. This variation is influenced by the significance of operating energy to total GWP for each dwelling.

Â·

GWP reduction generally diminishes for each successive energy Design.

6.4.2 Building Stock Scale The four building stock scenarios considered are labeled "Baseline", "7 Years", "4 Years", and "0 Years". The number of years refers to the period dwellings are constructed with a particular Design. For example, the 7 Years scenario considers Design 1 dwellings built in 2010-2016, Design 2 dwellings built in 2017-2023, Design 3 dwellings in 2024-2030, etc. The 0 Years scenario considers Design 6 dwellings built starting in 2010, and therefore represents a best case. Years in which Designs are introduced in the scenarios is presented in Table 6.1. Table B12 of Appendix B shows the additional material inputs relative to the Baseline required over the 40-year period for each of three scenarios and 40-year SE is presented in Table B7. The next three Figures (6.36-6.39) are annual GWP emissions for the building stock scenarios, starting with total GWP, and then breakdowns of operating energy and embodied stage GWP. In addition, accumulative total GWP is given in Figure A6. Table 6.1: Energy Efficiency Building Stock Scenarios

Scenario Baseline 7 Years 4 Years 0 Years

Observed Trends - Building Stock Energy Efficiency Scenario GWP Â· In 2049, annual GWP is reduced by 13.8, 18.9, and 25.5 Mt CO2 eq./yr (percent reductions of 26%, 35%, and 47%) relative to the Baseline for scenarios 7 Years, 4 Years, and 0 Years, respectively. Â· Percent annual GWP reductions are less than 10% until the years 2028, 2021, and 2012, for 7 Years, 4 Years, and 0 Years scenarios, respectively. In other

93

words, it takes 12, 8, and 3 years after the first improvement to dwellings constructed to see noticeable reduction in GWP. Â· The payback in terms of accumulated GWP is longer. Relative to the Baseline, percent accumulative GWP reductions are less than 10% until the years 2038, 2029, and 2014, for 7 Years, 4 Years, and 0 Years scenarios, respectively. Â· After 40 years total GWP reductions are 186, 289 and 505 Mt CO2 eq. (15%, 24%, and 42%) for scenarios 7 Years, 4 Years, and 0 Years, respectively. Â· The percent GWP reduction of the 0 Years scenario with respect to the Baseline (42%) is lower than the range of percent reduction noted for Design 6 dwellings with respect to Design 1 dwellings (43% to 66%) in Section 6.3.1. This is caused by the reduced influence of the operating energy stage relative to embodied effects in dynamic analysis of a growing building stock. Â· For the Baseline and 0 Years scenarios, the operational GWP rises at a linear rate due to the constant annual dwelling construction rate. Scenarios 7 Years and 4 Years show increasing operational emissions at a decreasing rate, a consequence of improvements to the dwellings constructed over time. Â· Over 40 years the maintenance stage increases embodied GWP by a factor of about 1.3, whereas the change in dwelling design alters embodied GWP by a factor of 1.2. Â· The percent embodied emissions in 2049 are 24%, 28%, and 39% for scenarios 7 Years, 4 Years, and 0 Years. This increase relative to the Baseline is due to the emergence of more energy efficient (i.e. more material intensive) dwellings. Â· After 40 years the GWP payback in terms of additional embodied emissions is 4.3 to 3.5 years, with lower paybacks for more aggressive efficiency measures (i.e. Years 0 scenario).

Year Figure 6.39 presents impact indicator results for the three energy efficiency scenarios relative to the Baseline. Reductions are noted across the three scenarios for all other impacts with the exception of eutrophication and ozone depletion. The increase in ozone depletion can be explained by the greater share of air-conditioning use for Designs 2 though 6. The degree of impact reduction for the various indicators and scenarios is dependent on (i) the significance of the operating energy stage to total impact and (ii) the influence of additional material inputs for energy efficiency. With the exception of ozone depletion, percent reduction for scenario 0 Years varies from 42% for GWP to 5% for solid waste. Across the four scenarios the embodied emissions account for 19-39%, 25-48%, 96-98%, and 100% of GWP, acidification, eutrophication, and ozone depletion, respectively, and in the range of 44-77% for HH respiratory effects, photochemical smog, and solid waste. Again, the percent embodied emissions increase with increased energy efficiency.

As shown in Figure 6.40, reductions in SE use for scenarios 7 Years, 4 Years, and 0 Years reduces energy resource use in all cases. In 2049, scenarios 7 Years, 4 Years, and 0 Years are predicted to consume 937 PJ, 818 PJ, and 661 PJ TPE, respectively. Including the Baseline, the four scenarios represent 10%, 7%, 6% and 5% of total Canadian energy use in 2007. 40 year primary energy consumption is 23,024 PJ, 20,504 PJ, and 15,309 PJ, amounting to reductions of 16%, 25%, and 44% relative to the Baseline. The degree of reduction is influenced by what each respective fuel is typically used for. Since SE reduction comes from SH and DHW use, fuels used for these purposes are reduced the most. For example, there is up to a 38%, 61% and 32% reduction relative to the Baseline for crude oil, natural gas and RPE, respectively. In the case of RPE, provinces that generate a lot of electricity this way typically have a higher percentage of electric space and water heaters. Lesser reductions are noted for fuels exclusively used for electricity generation such as coal and uranium.

6.5. Total Housing GWP Sensitivity GWP within the research scope varies between Case A Design 6 (Best Case, or BC) and Case C Design1 (Worst Case, or WC). Total GWP sensitivity is not the sum of the two types (material/fuel + energy performance) since better fuel choice reduces the reduction potential of energy efficiency (and vice versa). The effect of GWP sensitivity on annual SE is shown in Figure 6.41. By comparing these results to those of Figure 6.20 (Section 6.3) it can be concluded that BC annual SE is more a function of energy Design than material/fuel Case. Table B6 (Appendix B) shows corresponding static SE results at the building stock scale and BOMs for Toronto detached dwellings and building stocks are presented in Tables B10 and B11. Figure 6.42 shows the combined results of Figures 6.23 (Section 6.3) and 6.35 (Section 6.4) to illustrate the relative effects of material/fuel use choice and energy efficiency measures. Total Dwelling GWP sensitivity for each dwelling type is then presented relative to the Baseline in Figure 6.42. Finally, the BC, WC and Baseline building stocks are shown in Figure 6.44.

Observed Trends - Total Housing GWP Sensitivity Â· The relative influence between material/fuel choice and energy efficiency is different across cities. Â· The extent of dwelling sensitivity is 237-933 for row, 325-1,306 for semi-detached and 450-1,754 for detached housing, or 75-399%, 83-414%, and 86-387% of the Baseline, respectively. Â· Montreal is the best performing detached dwelling at 56 tonnes and Calgary is the poorest performing at 2,303 tonnes. Â· By 2049, BC annual building stock GWP is 25 Mt CO2/yr, a 54% reduction relative to the Baseline emissions (54 Mt). In contrast, WC is 100Mt, an increase of 86%. Â· The total sensitivity of annual building stock GWP in 2049 is 75 Mt and building stock results vary by a factor of over 4 between best and worst cases. Â· In 2049 the total range in annual emissions represents 3% to 13% of 2007 National emissions.

7.0 DISCUSSION 7.1 Commentary The R2000 standard and EnerGuide rating system evaluate dwellings in terms of SE use. Similarly, the green building rating system LEED for Homes currently evaluates energy and material aspects of environmental performance based on SE reduction and prescriptive requirements for materials. These techniques aim to reduce environmental impact by proxy since no analysis of emissions or resource use take place. In contrast, LCA of housing is widely recognized as an effective methodology for quantifying performance because it tracks actual flows to and from nature based on scientific principles and according to an international standard. The integration of LCA into regulation would not only allow buildings to be rated based on measurable performance indicators, but also would provide new tools (e.g. material and fuel choice) to designers to reduce impact. Benchmarking residential dwelling construction via batch assessment is an important first step for integration of LCA as it provides a basis for the determination of what acceptable environmental performance is, and in the case of green building rating systems, whether a proposed design is an acceptable improvement to conventional construction. The system boundary of typical energy end-use modeling encompasses site energy use and extends to electricity generation effects for GWP. Analysis therefore considers materials as externalities and doesn't include energy consumption by other sectors to produce and transport energy (i.e. pre-combustion). Similarly, the most common method of reporting environmental emissions and energy use in Canada is to allot various sectors the emissions they are directly responsible for. Examples of this approach include how Environment Canada inventories GWP, and how NRCan inventories SE use. This is a perfectly appropriate approach to inventorying effects as it is based on aggregating data from emitters/energy consumers in each sector. The question that arises is whether policy is best served by analysis of inventory data or energy end-use modeling. What lacks in these models are the inherent relationships that exist between emitters; a policy designed to reduce emissions from one emitter does not consider its influence on the industrial system as a whole. The implicit risk in
102

this disconnect is that analysis can either underestimate or overestimate the potential for emissions reductions. The LCA approach outlined herein accounts for the holistic nature of building design and the intertwined consequences initiated by their end-uses, thereby ensuring that trade-offs and the degree of impact reduction is acceptable. A significant step for LCA integration into LEED and other initiatives such as R2000 would be the inclusion of material takeoff and LCA calculations into an energy simulation program. This would provide designers with the means to evaluate housing and compare results with the requirements of such standards without needing expertise in LCA. HOT2000 is an ideal choice as it has a long history of validation, is used extensively by the industry, and is the software used for the R2000 standard and EnerGuide rating system (an optional path to LEED for Homes credit and OBC compliance). Building stock modeling would benefit from this integration as well. Material calculation adds significant work to modeling and would be greatly simplified if the simulation engine did this automatically. While LCA is a much improved methodology for assessing and potentially regulating the environmental implications of housing it does have its limitations and should not necessarily be the sole metric for compliance. For example, at present LCA does not readily handle local site specific effects from resource extraction or indoor air quality [97]. Many other building aspects can be dealt with by LCA in theory but may not be practical in the short term. For example, LEED for Homes encourages the use of roof assemblies that reduce urban heat island effect; without more research on the incremental benefit of heat island effect reduction, use of these assemblies may not be encouraged by LCA analysis alone. Besides the need for benchmark building data, implementation of whole building LCA in regulation requires a consistent, reputable, and publically available LCI database. This work has begun with the development of the US LCI database administered by the US National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). It is expected that over time the US LCI database will be of sufficient breath and quality for this purpose.

103

Past research on the life cycle effects of housing has typically been case study oriented and of limited scope. The most significant contribution of this research work is a framework to conduct whole building assessment on a much larger scale. A software platform such as Res-BEAT that stores dwelling design inputs and conducts batch assessment has two important benefits: 1) It facilitates benchmarking and stock modeling, tools for developing and validating the use of LCA in building regulation. 2) It facilitates a more vigorous analysis of the environmental performance of housing and the effects of design decisions. The analysis presented builds on the assessment of new detached and attached housing detailed in the CMHC report Life Cycle Environmental Impacts of the Canadian Residential Sector [48]. Improvements to the model include: Â· Dwelling space heating and cooling energy use varies by municipality (HOT2000 simulation) rather than by province; Â· Â· Archetype size varies by province rather than a national average; Electricity generation and building material environmental profiles vary by province rather than a national average; Â· The dependant relationship between building material and secondary energy use (i.e. embodied and operating energy effects) is accounted for; Â· The building material mix characterizes average usage rates rather than a single dwelling design; Â· Inclusion of more embodied effects associated with building products (e.g. building service systems); Â· Dynamic analysis of model inputs and outputs.

7.2 Model Limitations and Future Work The intent of this research is not to produce a set of validated benchmarks for use in regulation. The objective of this work is to illustrate that given the relative uniformity and simplicity of detached and attached construction (in contrast to multi-unit residential,
104

commercial and institutional buildings), statistical and building code analysis, energy simulation, and subsequent LCA may be sufficient for producing such benchmarks. Any set of benchmarks produced in this manner would have to be reviewed by building stakeholders and validated by industry experts. In terms of characterizing construction, the following items were left out of the research scope and should be addressed in future work: Â· Other building archetypes (e.g. 3-storey, bungalow, etc.), including those with slab on grade and flat roof construction. Â· Other assemblies common to residential construction such as SIP and concrete block walls, open web wood joists, etc. Â· Other operating systems such as radiant floor heating and instantaneous water heaters, etc. Â· Analysis of provincial building codes and local construction practices.

The following have been identified as some of the current issues with using statistics to produce housing benchmarks: Â· There are no residential building material use rate statistics; ideally they should be at a provincial or municipal scale. Â· There are no statistics on the rates of landfilling, reuse, and recycling of building materials at the municipal level. Â· There is generally no separation of energy use statistics between new and existing dwellings, making it difficult to gauge use rates for SH, SC, DHW, and AL systems at present. While the system boundary of benchmarks to be used in regulation is a highly debatable topic, the research model currently has elements where not all life cycle stages are included: Â· Electricity and natural gas use for AL are considered but the embodied effects of producing and replacing these products are not.

105

Â·

Hot water energy consumption is included but the upstream and downstream effects of municipal water use are not.

The building stock models presented are not intended to be legitimate forecasts of future emissions associated with residential housing. Instead, the analysis serves to identify general building stock performance characteristics and investigate the degree to which designers can influence performance by way of sensitivity analysis. Other than the issues discussed above, the stock models are limited in their ability to provide realistic forecasts due to the assumptions that manufacturing practice, electricity generation, building material and service systems use, and construction demand remain constant over the study period. There are many ways in which the system boundary of the stock model can be expanded to improve analysis and provide further insight about the residential sector. These include: Â· Renewable energy production and energy efficient systems: use of these systems is expected to rise and is therefore an important consideration for models of future construction. Â· The existing residential stock: due the volume of housing, energy reduction potential, and retrofitting activities of the existing stock it could greatly benefit from a life cycle analysis perspective. Â· Apartment buildings: these dwellings currently represent approximately one quarter of residential dwelling units and should be included in the system to account for their impact and changes in dwelling type use. Â· Infrastructure and transportation: expansion of scope to include these items would provide a more thorough analysis since housing, infrastructure, and transportation are interdependent facets of the residential sector.
Â·

Life cycle costing/social impacts: the integration of the triple bottom line for sustainability would greatly improve decision making.

106

8.0 CONCLUSIONS At current construction and demolition rates, dwellings constructed in the next 40 years could account for approximately 45% of housing in 2050. This presents an opportunity to drastically reduce the sector's energy consumption and environmental footprint. The LCA batch dwelling analysis and building stock modeling frameworks presented require significant statistical analysis, material and energy quantification, LCA data, and a means to calculate and present results. This research work shows that higher level analysis of the residential sector according to LCA is an achievable and appropriate improvement to current environmental performance measurement metrics. LCA provides a more robust and holistic assessment by capturing a greater share of effects and relaying more information to the practitioner. Furthermore, the analysis framework presented is also a critical step for future analysis that also considers life cycle costing and social life cycle assessment. Benchmarking Canadian construction via batch assessment is an important step for the implementation of LCA in construction regulation as it allows the establishment of minimum performance standards. Building stock LCA compliments and enhances energy end-use modeling approaches, and provides the basis to analyze the implications of proposed regulation. An Excel based program named Res-BEAT was developed for the purpose of conducting LCA batch dwelling and building stock analysis. Res-BEAT calculates impact results, resource use, bills of materials, and annual operating energy use. The program currently contains a database of over 18,000 dwelling designs that can be individually analysed or combined to form a building stock. The designs are categorized based on 36 Canadian locations, 29 dwelling archetypes, 3 material/fuel "Cases", and 6 energy performance "Designs". Building material takeoffs were calculated with a spreadsheet program developed for the research work named the Residential Archetype Materials Calculator (RAMC). The program allows the user to select any combination of common building assemblies; the resulting takeoffs are then input in Res-BEAT. Annual operating fuel use data was calculated with the energy modeling program HOT2000. Res-BEAT relies primarily on the Athena Institute's Impact Estimator database for LCA data.
107

The research work expanded the scope of typical residential assessment by estimating life cycle effects for the following elements currently not included in the Athena database: Â· Â· Â· Â· 6 building envelope materials/assemblies; 10 types of electrical wire, electrical boxes; 7 types of plumbing pipe, DHW tank; HVAC components: furnace, boiler, heat pump, air-conditioner, radiators, electric baseboard heaters, HRV, ductwork; Â· wood combustion.

Benchmarking dwelling performance via batch assessment provides considerable insight into current Canadian construction practice and allows for rigorous sensitivity analysis. The following are some pertinent findings regarding dwelling life cycle GWP for the 10 cities considered across Canada. Â· Row and semi-detached designs emit 54-71% and 70-81% that of detached dwellings, respectively. Â· SH contributes most to GWP, 36-60% for row, 45-68% for semi-detached, and 50-71% for detached. Â· Total emissions across cities vary considerably, 88-915 tonnes for row, 1161,098 tonnes for semi-detached and 152-1,340 tonnes for detached housing.
Â·

The extent of material/fuel use dwelling sensitivity is 179-713 tonnes for row, 246-1,013 tonnes for semi-detached and 344-1,373 tonnes for detached housing. Baseline emissions are closer to the best case.

Â·

Between Design 1 and Design 6 detached dwellings there is a 72 to 683 tonnes CO2 eq. decrease in GWP, or 43% to 66% reduction. This is the result of a decrease in operating energy GWP of 85-696 tonnes and increase in embodied GWP of 11-14 tonnes CO2 eq.

Â·

Within research scope, Montreal is the best performing detached dwelling at 56 tonnes and Calgary is the poorest performing at 2,303 tonnes.

108

Â·

Percent embodied GWP is 5-35% for row, 5-31% for semi-detached, and 4-29% for detached housing. This changes to 9-82%, 10-78%, and 11-78% for Design 6 dwellings.

Â·

Baseline embodied and pre-combustion effects are 17-47% of detached emissions. In other words, LCA analysis accounts for 1.2 to 1.9 times the impact as typical analysis.

The Baseline building stock model estimates that dwellings constructed during the period 2010-2049 will account for life cycle emissions of 54.1 Mt CO2 eq. in 2049. This represents 7% of GWP emitted by Canada in 2007. Similarly, the Baseline building stock is predicted to consume 1,270 PJ TPE in 2049, representing 10% of 2007 national consumption. The degree of impact associated with housing built in the next 40 years is therefore likely a significant contributor at the national scale. Much of the emissions captured by the model are from sources typically not attributed to the residential sector, including mining, transportation, manufacturing, etc. Analysis at the national scale shows that the research system boundary incorporates significant additional effects (1.5 times) associated with housing compared to typical energy enduse modeling. In the future, the proportion of embodied effects is expected to rise and its exclusion from the system boundary of stock modeling will become harder to justify. For example, the energy efficiency scenarios presented show that the embodied percent contribution to impact indicators can increase by as much as 20% over the study period. The sensitivity analysis performed aims to answer questions about the degree to which designers and policy makers can influence the performance of the stock. The range of results for material and fuel choice in 2049 is 41-100 Mt CO2 GWP and 1,189-1,641 PJ TPE, or 6-13% and 9-13% of 2007 Canadian effects, respectively. In 2049, the three energy efficiency building stock scenarios presented account for GWP emissions of 2940 Mt CO2 and 616-937 PJ TPE or 4-5% and 5-7% of 2007 national effects. While the degree of energy performance improvement is the primary driving force for impact

109

reduction, the analysis shows that another important factor is when those improvements are implemented in the stock. Adding the effect of both sensitivity cases, the best overall building stock results in 2049 are 25 Mt CO2 GWP and 598 PJ TPE, 54% and 53% reductions relative to the Baseline, respectively. While the building stock results are quite sensitive with respect to material/fuel choice and energy performance, attaining the best case performance is unlikely as it would require drastic shifts in construction practice in the short term. Two important mechanisms by which future life cycle effects could be further reduced are the increased use of renewable energy systems and changes to electricity generation fuel mixes. The research analysis shows that improved envelopes and equipment efficiencies are effective ways to lower emissions. Envelope improvements in particular require additional material inputs but the payback in terms of GWP and TPE is good for all cases considered in the research. Other than SE, the extent of reduction is influenced by how emission intensive the fuel mix being drawn on is. Analysis of changes to fuel use mix reveals that the best and worst case mixes for GWP have a similar influence on other impact indicators. The degree of fuel use GWP sensitivity for housing is very dependent on location, namely the provincial electricity generation mix. The influence of energy efficiency and material/fuel use on GWP are of similar order of magnitude generally; this begs the question as to which approach (or combination of) is a more economical strategy across Canada.

Glossary Definitions of environmental impact indicators have been provided by the Athena Sustainable Material Institute; the characterization factors for each indicator are primarily based on the EPA's Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) LCIA methodology. Other terms have been given definitions specifically for this report in order to provide clarity and consistency to the reader. Some of the terms have ambiguous meanings and definitions may differ somewhat between literature. Acidification: as per TRACI, acidification comprises processes that increase the

acidity (hydrogen ion concentration, [H+]) of water and soil systems. Acidification is a more regional rather than global impact, affecting fresh water and forests as well as human health when high concentrations of SO2 are attained. The acidification potential of an air emission is calculated on the basis of the number of H+ ions that can be produced, and is therefore expressed as potential H+ equivalents on a mass basis. Dynamic LCA results: effects presented as a function of time. Embodied effects: the combined effects of manufacturing, construction, maintenance, and end of life stages. Eutrophication: in TRACI, eutrophication is defined as the fertilization of surface waters by nutrients that were previously scarce. This measure encompasses the release of mineral salts and their nutrient enrichment effects on waters Â­ typically made up of phosphorous and nitrogen compounds and organic matter flowing into waterways. The result is expressed on an equivalent mass of nitrogen (N) basis. The characterization factors estimate the eutrophication potential of a release of chemicals containing N or P to air or water, per kilogram of chemical released, relative to 1 kg N discharged directly to surface freshwater. Global warming: TRACI uses global warming potentials, midpoint metric proposed by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for the calculation of the potency of greenhouse gases relative to CO2. The 100-year time horizons recommended by the
164

Glossary (cont.) IPCC and used by the United States for policy making and reporting are adopted within TRACI. Global warming potential (GWP) can be considered one of the most accepted LCIA categories due to the methodology and science behind the GWP calculation. GW P100 will be expressed on equivalency basis relative to CO2 Â­ that is, equivalent CO2 mass basis i.e. tonnes of CO2. Human health (HH) respiratory effects (Criteria air pollutants): the midpoint level selected by TRACI is used, based on exposure to elevated particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Particulate matter is the term for particles found in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. Emissions of SO2 and NOx lead to formation of the secondary particulates sulphate and nitrate. Particles can be suspended in the air for long periods of time. Some particles are large or dark enough to be seen as soot or smoke. Others are so small that individually they can only be detected with an electron microscope. Many manmade and natural sources emit PM directly or emit other pollutants that react in the atmosphere to form PM. These solid and liquid particles come in a wide range of sizes. Particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) pose a health concern because they can be inhaled into and accumulate in the respiratory system. Particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are referred to as "fine" particles and are believed to pose the greatest health risks. Because of their small size (approximately 1/30th the average width of a human hair), fine particles can lodge deep in the lungs. Non-renewable Primary energy (NRPE): energy drawn directly from earth from fossil fuel and nuclear sources, including for feedstock purposes. For this research the combustion of biomass is included in NRPE. Operating energy effects: the combined effects of space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water, and appliance and lighting end-uses. Ozone depletion: stratospheric ozone depletion is the reduction of the protective ozone within the stratosphere caused by emissions of ozone-depleting substances. International consensus exists on the use of ozone depletion potentials, a metric
165

Glossary (cont.) proposed by the World Meteorological Organization for calculating the relative importance of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), and halons expected to contribute significantly to the breakdown of the ozone layer. TRACI is using the ozone depletion potentials published in the Handbook for the International Treaties for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (UNEP-SETAC 2000), where chemicals are characterized relative to CFC-11. Pre-combustion effects: effects associated with the production and transport of energy sources. Renewable Primary Energy (RPE): energy sources drawn directly from earth from hydroelectric, wind, and photovoltaic sources. Secondary Energy (SE): energy produced by site. Smog (Photochemical ozone formation potential): under certain climatic conditions, air emissions from industry and transportation can be trapped at ground level where, in the presence of sunlight, they produce photochemical smog, a symptom of photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). While ozone is not emitted directly, it is a product of interactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The "smog" indicator is expressed on a mass of equivalent ethylene basis. Solid waste: this indicator summarizes LCI solid waste flows and is expressed in kg. Does not include occupant related household waste. Static LCA results: accumulated effects over the assumed dwelling service life or building stock study period. Total Primary Energy (TPE): sum of all energy sources that are drawn directly from earth. TPE is equivalent to NRPE + RPE. the transformation of primary or

secondary energy. For the purpose of this research SE is energy consumed at building
