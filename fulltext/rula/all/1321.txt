Abstract
Ti-6Al-4V alloy of extra low interstitial (ELI) grade has been used in biomedical applications because of its high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent biocompatibility. However, its poor wear resistance requires proper surface hardening. Body implants are also subjected to loads at varying strain rates. The objective of this study was to change the microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy via heat treatment and evaluate the mechanical properties with or without a hardened surface layer. It was observed that the hardened surface layer had only a small effect on the yield and tensile strengths but reduced ductility. The strain hardening exponent decreased with increasing strain rate. The strain rate sensitivity decreased as the true strain increased. The fractal dimension of fracture surfaces was observed to be associated with the strength and ductility. Fatigue crack initiation was observed to occur at the specimen surface, regardless of the applied strain amplitudes and heat treatment conditions.

CHAPTER ONE

Introduction

It has been reported that nearly 19,500 of previous hip replacements (or about 12.8% of

the 152,000 total hip replacements performed in 2000) involved painful revision surgeries, and the number of the total hip replacements is estimated to reach about 272,000 annually by 2030 in the US alone. As the life expectancy of the patient increases, such a high worrisome percentage would further increases, since the life expectancy of the current implant (with normal implant longevity of 12 to 15 years) cannot meet the everincreasing life expectancy of the patient [1]. These data and predictions highlight an everincreasing need for materials specifically suited for biomedical applications with improved long-term performance. The implant materials used in orthopedic surgery should not only avoid short-term rejection and infection, but also provide long-term biocompatibility and durability (i.e., high strength, long lifetime, high-wear resistance, high resistance to corrosion in the human body environment, no toxicity to human body, etc.) [2].

Ti-based alloys have excellent biocompatibility, low density, relatively low elastic modulus and excellent corrosion resistance [2-1 0]. Thus, they have become very good candidates as implant materials. The commonly-used Ti-based implant materials in orthopedic surgery are pure Ti and Ti-6Al-4V [2,8-11]. Current uses of Ti-6Al-4V ELI (extra low interstitial) alloy include hip and knee joints prosthesis, trauma/fixation

of the Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy has been seen in the literature. An objective of this investigation is to identify the LCF deformation characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy.

Figure 1.1

The hip and knee implants from Biomet. com [ 12}.

One of the important considerations in the durability of the Ti-6Al-4V ELI implant is its resistance to fatigue due to the routine activities of walking, running and stair climbing. A typical implant or bone experiences up to 2x10 6 cycles annually [13]. Fatigue fracture has indeed been identified as one of the major problems associated with failure of medical devices [13-17]. As shown from Figure 1.2, the fatigue failure of the implants in a 27 year old woman weighing 74 kg and a 76 year old woman weighing 71 kg occurred seriously in their body after only 24 months in service [ 16].

Figure 1.2

(b) 76 year old woman weighing 71 kg [16}.

On the other hand, where a contacting motion of counterparts is required, the relatively poor wear resistance of this alloy leads to excessive wear, mechanical and chemical instability, and implant loosening [2,8,21]. Various surface treatment methods, such as ion implantation, TiN coating, and thermal oxidation, have thus been proposed to improve the wear resistance by changing the nature of the surface [22]. The high

reactivity of titanium and its alloys with nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon at high temperatures facilitate the use of these elements to improve the poor wear resistance of these materials. Nitriding and oxidizing are two of the most widely used techniques for

CHAPTER TWO

Literature Review
promising approach for producing hard surfaces on Ti alloys [21 ,23,24-26], where a hardened oxygen diffusion zone formed beneath the Ti0 2 layer provided good protection from corrosion and wear [24,27,28] and also improved the biocompatibility [24]. The effect of thermal oxidation on the wear resistance [21 ,26,28], corrosion and corrosionwear behavior of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy [27,29] and stress-controlled high cycle fatigue [19,20] has recently been studied. This investigation is, therefore, aimed to evaluate the strain hardening exponent, strain rate sensitivity and LCF behavior of the Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy subjected to varying heat treatment conditions with and without the thermal oxide layer. At temperatures below 882░C, titanium has a hexagonal close packing (HCP) crystal structure, with a c/a ratio about 2% less than the ideal value of 1.633. Plastic deformation of HCP occurs by both slip and twinning [30]. These are common characteristics of unalloyed pure titanium. Titanium transforms to the

The simplest type of titanium alloy is the all-a formed by the addition of an a stabilizer usually aluminium. Aluminium has a strong solid solution hardening effect on titanium. The a+P alloys, with a small

p stabilizer,

such as Ti+6o/oAl+4% V are also used at elevated

temperatures [30]. The main focus of study in this thesis will be the ELI grade of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, with extra low interstitials of oxygen and nitrogen.

Primary a exists in two forms, widmanstatten plates and grain boundary a or equiaxed a. The widmanstatten structure forms on cooling either from the p, into the a+p field, to some lower temperature in the same two-phase field, as shown in Figure 2.2. An orientation relationship exists between the widmanstatten a plates, which form within the grains and the

p grains in which they form.

Equiaxed a will develop from the platelet form by hot working

in the a+p field followed by recrystallization in the same two-phase field, but not necessarily at the same temperature used for hot working as shown in Figure 2.4 [30].

The a+p interfaces, in both widmanstatten and the equiaxed a, may serve as sites for void

provide a ready path for void growth. Voids in the platelet structure reach a critical size for fracture at lower strains than they do in equiaxed structures, where the a particles also serve as crack stoppers [30]. Ti-6Al-4V ELI is primarily a a+p alloy, showing the characteristics of improved ductility and toughness because of reduced interstitial impurities [31].

2.2

Hardness

Hardness is one of the important mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy, because of its low wear resistance. As mentioned earlier, Ti alloys have tribological characteristics like

Figure 2.4

high friction coefficient, small resistance to wear and high propensity to seizure [3]. To

8

overcome these problems researchers have used surface treatments to increase the hardness to generate surface hardened layer. Different surface hardening methods have been suggested, including a TiN coating on the surface by nitrogen glow discharge as the plasma source [32]. Figure 2.5 shows the hardness profiles obtained by Ueda eta!. [32] for different times of treatments. At about 150 minutes of treatment, the hardness was about 25 GPa, or about 5 times the hardness of the untreated sample. The hardness improvement extends up to around 1.2 J.Lm depth, decaying smoothly to the bulk hardness values. Furthermore, more than 2.5 times improvement could be achieved when the samples were treated at 400░C for one hour [32] .

Dudek et a!. [33] exposed the surface of the specimens to glow discharge plasma in an atmosphere composed of Ar and 02 with two different oxygen concentrations, which resulted in surface regions of all the specimens hardened due to inward diffusion of oxygen. As shown in Figure 2.6, the diffusion treatment with the use of the glow discharge plasma in Ar

+ 02 atmosphere may be an effective way to improve the tribological characteristics of Ti6Al-4V alloy through an effective decrease in friction coefficient and increase of resistance to wear [33].The inset in figure 2.6 representing different diffusion hardening process namely, 0 (Air- atmosphere), A (90% Ar + 10%02 for 3 Hours), B(90% Ar + 10%02 for 6 Hours) and C ( 10% Ar + 90%0 2for 6 Hours).

Santos et a!. [34] evaluated the nano-hardness, elastic modulus and brittleness of titanium oxide (titania) films produced by anodic oxidation for biomedical applications. Corrosion resistance increased because of high affinity between titanium and oxygen, promoting a spontaneous formation of thin stable oxide layer on the Ti-surface. Their results showed that oxide films were less ductile [34]. Gulyeruz and Cinemoglu [29] stated that thermal oxidation carried out in a normal atmospheric condition containing oxygen as well as nitrogen appeared to be very promising for producing hard surfaces on Ti-alloys. In their study, they examined the effect of thermal oxidation on the dry sliding wear resistance of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Oxidation introduced hard surface layers composed of Ti0 2 and oxygen diffusion zone beneath it. A hardness survey conducted under a load of 10 g with a Vickers

[35] conducted the tensile and fatigue tests of Ti-6Al-4V of the standard and ELI grades in the form of seamless tubes for different material conditions and their results are tabulated in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3. was seen that the tensile strength of fatigued specimens of Ti-6Al-4V ELI with equiaxed a structure increases rapidly within the low cycle fatigue region. On the other hand, the elongation of fatigued specimens tested at various fatigue increments decreases rapidly within the low cycle fatigue region. The energy absorbed by fatigued specimens during

various fatigue steps decreases rapidly in the late stages of the low cycle fatigue region. Furthermore, a hardness gradient develops initially from the surface to the inside of the specimens, and then in the later stages of fatigue, the internal hardness is equal to the surface hardness. The sub-structures both near and far from the surface of fatigued specimens, observed after various fatigue steps, show an increased dislocation density. However, at the late stages in low cycle fatigue region, the dislocation density far from the specimen surface also increases dramatically [ 15].

The increase in each strength is attributed to work hardening. At this late stage of the low cycle fatigue region, the tensile strength and 0.2% proof stress increase by about 6 and 12%,

Akahori and Niinomi [15] examined the tensile and fatigue properties of Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy with equiaxed a structure, where the hot rolled plates were subjected to heat treatment at 950░C followed by air cooling and aging at 813K in a vacuum, which produced an equiaxed a structure.

Naughton and Tiernan [3], conducted tensile experiments on extra low interstitial (ELI) grade of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, with a nominal diameter of 2.36 mm. The stress-strain behavior of the alloy was examined at various temperatures ranging from 750

oc to

1050 ░C. It was

determined that the flow stress is strain rate dependent, with a decrease in strain rate leading to a decrease in the associated flow stress as seen from Figure 2.9, Figure 2.10 and Figure 2.11. It was also clear that an increase in temperature decreased the associated flow stress, which can be attributed to adiabatic heating.

So far there are only limited results reported on the strain rate sensitivity and strain hardening exponent for the ELI grade of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, especially with a hardened oxide layer. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the mechanical properties of heat treated Ti6Al-4V ELI alloy by varying the microstructure via heat treatment with or without the oxide layer by conducting tensile tests at various strain rates and low cycle fatigue tests. The results are reported in the ensuing chapters. Tensile results are presented in chapter 4, fatigue results are reported in chapter 5 and the relation between fractal dimension and fracture surface

Figure 4.2 shows the micro hardness profile from the surface to the inside of the specimen. It is seen that the highest hardness value occurred at the surface of the specimens, indicating that the surface has effectively been hardened. Similar results on the microhardness profile were also reported in [21,23,27]. The specimen subjected to water quenching (WQ) exhibited much higher hardness values, while the furnace cooling (FC) led to the lowest hardness out of all the conditions considered in this study. This is in agreement with the results obtained by Jovanovic et al. [37] for Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Kruger eta/. [41] reported that microstructures obtained by annealing below the

followed by FC showed lowest hardness values,

the balanced properties of high deformability and strength and highest energy consumption for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. In general, the hardness increases as the rate of cooling increases. This is due to the formation of martensite arising from rapid cooling [38,39,42,43]. The hardness of the specimen subjected to air cooling (AC) lies in-between those of the WQ and FC. It is also seen that the AC specimen had a slightly higher hardness than the as-received specimen. This could be understood on the basis of the difference in the microstructures shown in Figure 4.1(a) and (c), where the acicular

microconstituent and

more primary a phase were present in the as-received specimen (Figure 4.1(a)). Concerning the effect of the shape of the microstructures, the plate-shaped (or acicular) microstructure had normally higher resistance to the dislocation movement or plastic deformation, thus leading to a higher hardness. It is also seen from Figure 4.2 that there was a slight increase in the hardness close to the surface in the as-received specimen, but it was much lower than the

The WQ+AG and WQ resulted in a higher YS. This trend is consistent with the results reported by Semiatin and Bieler [3 7] and Jovanovic et al. [40]. In another study of Ti alloys, Soares et al. [46] also reported that the greater strength of the WQ material was due to the rapid cooling in water or oil, where the

sи 1 is shown in Figure 4.5. The WQ + aging condition gave rise to the highest value of the stress but the lowest ductility. This is attributed to the formation of the martensitic microstructure induced by WQ. In comparison with the internal average microhardness shown in Figure 4.2, there was a clear correspondence between the hardness and the tensile strength shown in Figure 4.5. It is also seen that, unlike the heat-treated specimens, the as-

The effect of the strain rate on the UTS of this alloy in different heat treatment conditions is shown in Figure 4.7. Again, the UTS increased with increasing strain rate, and the hardest material subjected to WQ + aging corresponded to the highest UTS. This is in agreement with the results reported by Semi atin and Bieler [3 7], where the peak stress increased with decreasing alpha platelet thickness, and the peak stress was also highest for the martensitic microstructure in the Ti-6Al-4V alloy quenched from 955░C. Figure 4.8 shows the variation of the ductility with the strain rate for the six material conditions. As expected, the ductility

While the n 1 values did not seem to show a decreasing trend of n values, the n 1 values were much larger than then values. The heat treatment led to a decrease in the n1 values, with the n 1 values in the FC condition closest to those of the as-received condition.

range, the WQ specimen exhibited a much higher initial work hardening rate after yielding occurred. This was attributed to the higher dislocation densities generated in the martensitic structure (Figure 4.1(b)), which was observed by Markandeya et al. [52] in Cu-Ti-Cd alloy as well. Kruger et a!. [41] also reported that water quenching led to higher hardness values due to a much higher dislocation density and sometimes twins in Ti-6Al-4V alloy. A similar phenomenon was observed by Praveen eta/. [53] in Ni-based superalloy IN718. It is seen in Figure 4.12 that the work hardening rate was low in the as-received and FC conditions, and the work hardening rate of the AC condition lay in-between those of the WQ and the asreceived/FC conditions, due to the difference in the microstructures shown in Figure 4.1.

and the evaluated mL [or a 1(e)] is also given in Table 4.1. Again, the strain rate sensitivity decreased as the true strain increased. The Lindholm strain-rate sensitivity values are much larger than the strain-rate sensitivity values evaluated via the common approach. However, both the common and Lindholm strain rate sensitivity values decreased monotonically with increasing true strain. Similar results were also reported in non-ELI grade of Ti-6Al-4V [48], extruded AZ31 magnesium alloy [55] and ultrafine-crystalline Cu [57].

Strain rate sensitivity

Figure 4.13 demonstrates the curves of ln( cr) vs. ln(strain rate) at different true strain values in the AC + AG condition, where the slope indicates the strain rate sensitivity, m, in the common approach as expressed by equation (4.1) [45,54]. The obtained strain rate sensitivity is shown in Table 4.1. It is seen that the strain rate sensitivity decreased with increasing true strain. Similar results were also reported by Lin and Chen [55]. However, the strain rate sensitivity values evaluated using the common approach were small. The Lindholm approach [56] was thus used to evaluate the strain rate sensitivity based on the following equation, (4.6)

However, the cyclic stress amplitude was the highest for the AC specimen, in the middle for the as-received specimen, and the lowest for the FC specimen, as shown in Figure 5.2.

Hysteresis loops and mean stress change

Variation of mean stress with the number of cycles at different total strain amplitudes for the A C material.

The mean stress plotted as a function of the number of cycles at different applied strain amplitudes for the AC sample is shown in Figure 5.6. The mean stress increased with increasing total strain amplitudes, which is also in agreement with the result reported in [63,64]. At the higher strain amplitude (0.8%), the mean stress decreased until failure, and it remained nearly constant throughout the entire fatigue life at the strain amplitude of 0.6%. At the lower strain amplitudes (0.2o/o and 0.4%), the mean stress slightly increased up to about 100 cycles and then became constant.

Figure 5.7 shows the variation of mean stress at a strain amplitude of 0.4% with the number of cycles for the three material conditions. After the initial change within about 100 cycles, the mean stress remained almost constant, being the highest for the AC sample, followed by the as-received and the FC samples.

Fractals and Fractography

6.1

Introduction to fractal analysis in materials science

Materials science is one of the fields in which quantitative fractography is critical since the mechanical properties of materials are directly related to the fracture mode/mechanism or microscopic fracture events. The concept of fractal dimension, used to describe the irregular surfaces with a self-similar (or self-affine) nature, provides a basis for the quantitative characterization of the tortuosity of fracture surfaces, and the potential linkage between the fractal dimension and mechanical properties. Manderbrot et al. [68,69] first introduced this concept to materials science in 1984. Since then, considerable work has been reported in the literature. The fractal dimension has recently been used to estimate the theoretical strength of materials [70], analyze the well-known experimental findings on the size effect of fatigue strength of materials [71], model the dominating damage mechanism in ductile fracture [72], and offer a new theoretical basis for the empirical Kitagawa diagram used to describe the variation of the fatigue threshold stress intensity range with the crack length [73]. Fractal geometry, fracture mechanics, molecular dynamics and molecular orbital calculations, and fractographic observations have also been used jointly to link the atomic bond-breaking process to the formation of the observed fracture surface topography [74].

6.1.1 Contradictory relationships

6.1.2 Methods of measuring fractals

Different relationships between the fractal dimension of fracture surfaces and mechanical properties have been reported in the literature. Hilders et al. [75, 76] reported that yield strength and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) decreased and impact energy/toughness increased with increasing fractal dimension for duplex stainless steel tested at room temperature. Dai and Wu [77] reported that the fractal dimension increased with increasing toughness in a composite material. Hsiung and Chou [78] observed that the fractal dimension increased with increasing impact toughness in a high strength low alloy steel. Wang et al. [77] reported that the fatigue threshold of a dual-phase steel increased with increasing fractal dimension. These results indicated that the higher the fractal dimension value, the rougher the surface and the tougher the material [79].

These different relationships have been pointed out to be associated with the measurement methods [83-89]. A number of methods used to determine the fractal dimension of fracture surfaces have been reported, including the slit island method [68,79,82,90], the vertical section method [82,91], the secondary electron line scanning method [89]. Manderbrot et al. [68] first used the slit island method, where a certain amount of peaks on the fracture surface were ground off and polished. This procedure generated the so-called "islands and lakes" pattern on the fracture surface. The fractal dimension was then determined on the basis of the perimeter as a function of the area of either "island" or "lakes" [68,92]. Drury and Gokhale [86] used the profilometry data to measure the fractal dimensions by defining a surface roughness parameter as the ratio of total apparent surface area to the projected area, which basically became a three-dimensional (3D) analogue to profile roughness. To overcome the

On the other hand, Manderbrot et al. [68] reported that the impact energy decreased as the fractal dimension increased for a 300-grade maraging steel after Charpy impact tests. Richards and Dempsey [81] observed similar results, i.e., a slight increase of UTS with increasing fractal dimension in Ti-4.5Al-5.0Mo-1.5Cr alloy. Pande et al. [82] also reported a negative relationship between the dynamic tear energy and the fractal dimension of fracture surfaces in the Ti-6Al-2V alloy with varying amounts of Zr.

difficulties of one- and two-dimensional measurements [68,82,90,91], fractal analysis has been conducted using 3D topography of fracture surfaces by reconstructing and quantifying by means of SEM stereo pairs, image processing and analysis and computer vision [93-97]. It appeared that the method related to the 3D area measurements of irregular fracture surfaces with varying scale lengths would be more appropriate to determine the fractal dimension of fracture surfaces. The objective of this investigation was, therefore, to determine the fractal dimension of fracture surfaces of the Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy via 3D measurements of fracture surface areas, and identify the relationship between the fractal dimension and the mechanical properties.

Fractal dimensions were determined via three-dimensional (3D) measurements of fracture surfaces areas versus the ruler scale (i.e., the side length of equilateral triangular tiles) using MeX software. The images of fracture surfaces used for the fractal analysis were taken near the centre and joined to form a 3D image at a magnification of 1000 times. Three 3D images were analyzed for each material condition after converting them into a digital elevation model (DEM) using a cut-off wavelength of 15--t, where A, is in micrometers. A typical example is shown in Figure 6.1, where the relative area (the ratio of the measured 3D fracture surface area to its projected area) is plotted as a function of the ruler scale (or lateral resolution) in double-log coordinates.

Similar results on 7075-T651 aluminum alloy were reported by Hilders eta!. [98]. It is seen from Figure 6.3 that the more ductile specimens, corresponding to lower strengths arising from varying heat-treatment conditions, were represented by higher values of fractal dimension. This is in agreement with the results reported in the literature: the

ELI alloy studied are shown in Figure 6.5 in both as-received (Figure 6.5(a)) and heat-treated (Figure 6.5(b,c,d,e,f)) conditions. As seen from Figure 6.5(a), the as-received material exhibited a characteristic dimple-like ductile fracture with a large number of tear ridges.

While the fracture surface after furnace cooling (representing the softest material state) exhibited a similar dimple-like ductile fracture, the tear ridges appeared to be more

The roughness of fracture surfaces is basically associated with the fracture mode or mechanism, which is in tum dependent on the microstructures or heat treatment conditions. In general, the mode of ductile fracture gives rise to a rougher fracture surface, coupled with more energy absorption during the fracture process, whereas the brittle fracture or cleavage fracture (e.g., the fracture of glasses) is flatter. Typical fracture surfaces of the Ti-6Al-4V

Examination of fatigue fracture surfaces

Figure 6.6 shows a few typical SEM images of fracture surfaces of the AC condition after fatigue tests. From the low-magnification SEM images showing the overall view of the fracture surfaces at the total strain amplitude of 0.4% and 0.8%, Figure 6.6(a)-(c), it is seen that fatigue crack initiation in all the tested specimens, regardless of the applied strain amplitudes, occurred from the specimen surface. However, at the higher strain amplitude of 0.8%, multiple crack initiation was observed, as indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 6.6(b). In another AC sample tested at a strain amplitude of 0.4%, the initiation site and propagation zone could be clearly seen at a slightly higher magnification (Figure 6.6(c)). Fatigue crack propagation was characterized by the characteristic fatigue striations, In conjunction with some secondary cracks and tear ridges, as shown in Figure 6.6(d).

Figure 6.7 shows typical SEM images of fracture surfaces of the Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy in the FC condition fatigued at a total strain amplitude of 0.4%. Again, the crack initiated from the specimen surface (Figure 6. 7(a)). A close examination at higher magnification indicated that the crack initiation site had quasi-cleavage features, coupled with slip band cracking in some grains and secondary cracks. Also, the plastic deformation marks could clearly be seen. Fatigue crack propagation was again characterized by the typical fatigue striations, coupled with some secondary cracks and tear ridges, as shown in Figure 6.7(c) and (d). With increasing distance from the crack initiation site, the spacing of the fatigue striations increased.

10. Both stress amplitude and mean stress were higher for the AC sample when compared to the

FC sample, the as-received sample fell in-between the AC and FC conditions.

2. Detailed thermal oxidation heat treatment (HT) and microstructural characterization via
changing HT parameters are of interest.
11. Fractal dimension of the tensile fracture surfaces was found to be the highest in the FC

condition, corresponding to the highest ductility. The fractal dimension increased as the roughness of fracture surfaces increased.

3. Stress-controlled high cycle fatigue tests are needed to examine the effect of thermal oxide

hardened layer on fatigue life.

12. After tensile tests, the as-received and FC materials exhibited a characteristic dimple-like
ductile fracture with a large number of tear ridges. The fracture surface of the AC + aging and AC specimen consisted of dimples with some cleavage-like facets. The fracture mode in the WQ + aging and WQ conditions exhibited more of cleavage cracking in conjunction with some dimples.

4. The effect of the thermal oxide hardened layer on the fatigue crack propagation behavior is also important.

applied strain amplitudes and heat treatment conditions. At the higher strain amplitude, multiple crack initiation occurred. Fatigue crack propagation was characterized by the characteristic fatigue striations, coupled with some secondary cracks and tear ridges
