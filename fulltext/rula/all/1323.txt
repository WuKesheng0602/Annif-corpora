Abstract
FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF A SINGLE CONDUCTOR WITH A STOCKBRIDGE DAMPER UNDER AEOLIAN VIBRATION © Oumar Barry, 2010 Master of Applied Science in the Program of Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University A finite element model is developed to predict the vibrational response of a single conductor with a Stockbridge damper. The mathematical model accounts for the two-way coupling between the conductor and the damper. A two-part numerical analysis using MATLAB is presented to simulate the response of the system. The first part deals with the vibration of the conductor without a damper. The results indicate that longer span conductors without dampers are susceptible to fatigue failure. In the second part, a damper is attached to the conductor and the effects of the excitation frequency, the damper mass, and the damper location are investigated. This investigation shows that the presence of a properly positioned damper on the conductor significantly reduces fatigue failure.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Background

This thesis focuses on Aeolian vibration of transmission lines, the vibration caused by a wind force to a single conductor. This type of vibration, also known as windinduced vibration, has a high frequency and small-amplitude motion, which arises from alternating forces caused by vortex shedding. Vortex shedding is associated with the flow of air across a bluff body. In addition to Aeolian vibration, there are two other types of conductor motion that are also caused by wind force. The first is galloping which is characterized by large amplitudes and low frequencies of vibration and the second is wake-induced oscillation. The latter is restricted to bunddle conductor and it is distinguished by medium amplitude of vibration and higher natural frequencies, but its frequencies are usually lower than Aeolian vibration frequencies. The term Aeolian vibration only refers to cases in which the fluid is air. Transmission lines are not the only structures that experience Aeolian vibration. Other examples of systems that also experience vortex induced vibration include bridges, heat exchangers, offshore platforms, and underwater cables. The frequency of Aeolian vibration ranges from 3 to 50 Hz and the wind speed ranges from 1 to 7 m/s. Usually the vibration of the conductor is not noticeable to an observer because the diameter of the conductor ranges from 6 to 50 mm, which in general is greater than the amplitude of vibration [1]. The maximum amplitude of vibration occurs at resonance and 1

this arises when some of the natural frequencies of the conductor coincide with the forcing frequency also known as Strouhal frequency. Any type of vibration imperils the life of the structure. Aeolian vibration of transmission lines, if left uncontrolled, can result in serious accidents causing injuries and death, and/or considerable economical loss. The vibration of the conductor produces alternating bending stresses and tensile stresses in the vicinity of the clamps. Eventually, this leads to fatigue damage of the conductor (Figure 1.1) in the form of broken strands in the outer layer, usually at the point of contact such as the suspension clamp.

Figure 1.1: Breakage of conductor on Hydro Quebec transmission lines [2].

Past field observations show that Aeolian vibration is most likely to occur in open fields and bodies of water (such as rivers, lakes, etc.) and usually in late evenings or early mornings. This is not surprising since light breezes occur during these periods. Aeolian vibration is sometimes detected when observing the conductor. However, this is not always the case; most often it is not noticeable until damage occurs. Examples of damages include breakage of conductor strands, insulator strings, and loosening of parts (i.e., suspension clamps). Aeolian vibration can be controlled by dampers. The most popular damping device

2

used by transmission lines utilities is the Stockbridge damper. This damper is used to minimize or eliminate the vibration by reducing the induced strains of the conductor near the clamps to a safe level of 200 µm/m. Past investigations have proven that a damper is more effective when it is designed to cover a wide range of frequencies and when it is appropriately positioned on the conductor [1][3][4].

Motivation

Power plants are generally located in remote areas, far from cities, and high voltage transmission lines are used to supply power to the cities. Power is transmitted through 151,848 km of overhead transmission and distribution lines across the province of Ontario [5]. The cost of installing these lines is very high, but it can be reduced by increasing the tension in the lines. However, increasing the tension increases the susceptibility of the conductor to vibration which eventually leads to fatigue failure. For safety reasons, transmission line engineers have imposed limitations on the maximum magnitude of the tension. This limitation is 20% and 25% of its rated tensile strength (RTS) in the summer and winter season, respectively [5]. Aeolian vibration is one of the most important of the many factors which limit the life of conductors of overhead lines by damaging the conductor through wire fatigue break usually at the suspension clamp where the maximum stress occurs. This failure could lead to power interruption, hence economic loss and personal discomfort. For instance, Hydro One residential and industrial customers in Sarnia experienced a blackout in 2005 due to the breakage of a conductor on the Sarnia-to-Scott transformer station. Later in 2008 another failure occurred on the transmission lines of the Cowal junction to Longwood TS in London. The damages to both lines were attributed to uncontrolled Aeolian vibration. Investigations concluded that the conductor tension was quite high (27% RTS) and the dampers on the lines were not effective. Some of the recommendations include adding more dampers to the transmission lines and positioning them at suitable locations [6]. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 show a broken conductor strand of the messenger wire of a Stockbridge damper, and a conductor and torsional

damper failure on Cowal junction to Longwood TS in London, respectively.

Figure 1.2: Broken conductor strand and slippage of the messenger wire of the Stockbridge damper [6].

Figure 1.3: Sample of conductor and torsional damper failure on Cowal junction to Longwood TS in London [7].

Furthermore, earlier in 1996, Manitoba Hydro Company reported wind damage of about 10 million USD due to the failure of 19 transmission towers [8]. At the CIGRE meeting in Toronto in 2009, Electricite ´ de France reported the collapse of 45 towers 4

in the southern part of France due to Aeolian vibration [9]. In summary, the examples of transmission line and tower failures described in the previous paragraphs show that the problem with Aeolian vibration is still a challenge to transmission line engineers. Therefore, it is worthwhile to further study conductor vibration in order to predict the dynamic of the conductor, which will enable transmission line design engineers to justify increasing the tension in the conductor, and optimize the selection, number, and location of dampers.

1.3

Objective

As mentioned previously, this thesis is concerned with the Aeolian vibration of transmission lines. The main objective is to provide an alternate mathematical model of a single conductor vibration with Stockbridge dampers attached to it. Unlike the mathematical models found in the literature, this new model considers the two-way coupling between the conductor and the Stockbridge damper. A finite element code is written in MATLAB programming environment to assess the impact of the location of the damper and its properties on the system response.

1.4

Thesis Overview

The thesis is arranged in five chapters. The following chapter reviews the literature on Aeolian vibration of a single conductor. The modeling of the conductor and Stockbridge damper with external wind force excitation are presented. Also, the energy balance method is reviewed. Chapter three presents the mathematical model of a single conductor with and without a damper. The equation of motion of a single conductor without a damper is first derived using Newton's law and the natural frequency equation was obtained through the separation of variable method. Furthermore, the kinetic and potential energies of the conductor and damper are obtained. The finite element method is employed to obtain the discretized governing equation.

5

In chapters four and five, a numerical analysis without and with a damper is presented, respectively. The validation of the mathematical model is established using the results in Ref. [10] and the results of the commercial finite element analysis software ANSYS. Finally, chapter six contains a summary of the contributions of this research and suggestions for future work.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1 Summary of Findings

A lot of research on Aeolian vibration was done in the 70's and 80's. Most authors agree that the location of the damper is crucial to the damper's effectiveness. In 1985 Nigol and Houston [11] studied the control of Aeolian vibration of a single conductor. They described the development of a general method for analyzing the combined response of various single conductor-damper arrangements, presented a summary of experimental verifications, and used the models to demonstrate optimum damping concepts. Feldmann [12] from Electricite ´ de France studied the effects of Stockbridge dampers using theoretical and experimental approach. He found that the Stockbridge dampers were remarkably efficient and observed that counterweights do not dissipate energy, but produce a coupling between the damper and the conductor, which makes them good disturbers of Aeolian vibration . In 2000, Leblond and Hardy [13] described a probabilistic model for predicting Aeolian vibration of single conductors based on the conductor fatigue endurance limit approach and the linear fatigue damage accumulation. Both models are used to assess safe-design tensions. The endurance limit approach assesses conductor vibration severity by comparing the maximum bending stress amplitude with the fatigue endurance limit of the conductor at the suspension clamp. The cumulative damage 7

approach, however, assesses the severity of conductor vibration by calculating the anticipated lifetime of the conductor. Note that this approach requires S-N curves (cyclical stress, S, against the logarithmic scale of cycles to failure, N) for the different classes of conductors and some wind statistics. The authors determined that the safe-design tension is 11.1% RTS or (H/w) = 811 m and 13.2% RTS or (H/w) = 961 m for endurance limit and cumulative damage approach, respectively. Another important paper on Aeolian vibration was published by Braga et al. [14]. The authors compared the values of fatigue endurance limits suggested by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers), EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute), and CIGRE (International Council on Large Electric Systems). The IEEE and EPRI recommendations are based on the endurance limit approach, while the CIGRE recommendation is based on the cumulative damage approach. An important finding from IEEE based on mechanical simulation is that the bending amplitude strain is related to the diameter of the last layer of the cable for a range of the stress loads from 15 to 30%. The IEEE posits that the value of 200 µm/m can meet the criteria of mechanical reliability. EPRI provides a more elaborate formula for relating bending amplitude to the maximum cable strain and maximum bending stress. Due to the effect of the stiffness, the bending stress was found to be maximum in the region contiguous to the clamp.

Conductor

Aeolian vibration is characterized by the interaction of the conductor with the damper and wind force. The following section focuses on the construction and dynamic modeling of the conductor.

2.2.1

Materials and Construction

The conductor used in transmission lines are made of several layers of individual round wires packed tightly together in concentric counter-rotating helices (Figure 2.1 and 2.2). The most common conductor used in transmitting power is the aluminum conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) because of its high tensile-strength-to-weight ratio. Most of the power is transmitted through the aluminum outer layers. The inner layer of the ACSR is made of steel to increase the strength of the conductor. ACSR conductor is available for a wide range of steel alloys. The higher strength conductor is usually used for river crossing (longer span) since this requires more resistance. Other types of conductors used in transmission lines include all aluminum conductor (AAC) and all aluminum alloy conductor (AAAC). AAC consists of a minimum purity of 99.5% of aluminium and is mostly used in urban areas and AAAC is made of aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloy and has an excellent corrosion resistance and strength-to-weight ratio.

2.2.2

General Mathematical Model of The Conductor

Claren and Diana [4] are among the first authors to develop a mathematical model of a single conductor. They showed that the physical model of the conductor is similar to an Euler-Bernoulli beam under the action of an axial load (design tension). If a

constant flexural rigidity is assumed and damping is ignored, the equation of motion in the presence of the tension T may be written as: EI  4w  2w  2w - T = - m x4 x2 t2 (2.1)

where EI denotes the flexural rigidity, m is the mass per unit length, and w is the transverse displacement. Using the mathematical model of Claren and Diana [4], a finite difference method was used by Dhotard and Ganesan [3] to examine the dynamics of a single conductor vibration with dampers. A close-form expression of the natural frequency of the conductor was determined for a simply supported end cable, a fixed end cable, and simply supported cable with flexural rigidity. The difference in the values of natural frequencies found in the simply supported end cable with and without flexural rigidity was less than 3%. The author hypothesized that for low frequency excitation (i.e., low wind speed), the location of the dampers have negligible effect on the strain. However, its effect is considerable in high frequencies excitation. Further, higher strains result with increasing length of the cable which calls for the use of more dampers. The effect of the number of dampers on the strain is negligible in low frequencies.

2.2.3

Conductor Self-Damping

When the conductor flexes the strands of the conductor slip against each other and frictional force is induced. This relative motion is the main source of conductor self-damping; a phenomenon when the conductor dissipates energy internally while vibrating. Conductor self-damping can be a major source of damping, especially for shorter span and lower tension system. Sometimes dampers are not needed for a short span with low tension because the conductor self-damping is able to dissipate most of the energy from the wind. However, when the tension of the conductor is increased, the strands tend to lock and slippage is reduced, thereby reducing the conductor self-damping. This explains why the conductor tension is usually kept low. Past investigations on this topic have led to identification of empirical formulas

11

to predict the power dissipation of the conductor due to self-damping (Psd ). The relationship is in the exponential form and contains constants that depend on the conductor parameters [15]: Ksd Y p f u Psd = L T (2.2)

where L is the span length, Y the amplitude of vibration corresponding to the natural frequency f , Ksd is a constant of proportionality, and T is the tension of the conductor. The parameters p,  , and u are all exponential factors found experimentally as shown in Table 2.1. The table below is a tabulation of the values of the constants obtained by different authors.
Table 2.1: Experimental conductor self-damping data.
Investigators Tompkins et al.(1956) Rawlins(1983) Kraus and Hagedorn (1991) Noiseux (1991) p 2.3-2.6 2.2 2.47 2.44 u 5.0-6.0 5.4 5.38 5.63  1.9 2.8 2.76 L(m) 36 36 30 63

Based on these values and the empirical formula, equation 2.2, it is obvious that the conductor dissipates less power when the tension is increased. This observation is in agreement with the remarks mentioned previously. Power dissipation increases in a scenario where the tension is constant while the frequency and amplitude of vibration are increasing.

2.3

Damper

The objective of vibration dampers is to eliminate or reduce Aeolian vibration by absorbing the energy from the wind in order to stabilize the motion of the conductor. Damping of the conductor is controlled by dampers that reduce the strain level to the safe strain limit of 200 µm/m [14]. The effectiveness of a damper depends on its response within its frequency band. 12

Based on a rule of thumb, it was thought that dampers' locations will not coincide with a node provided the location is less than the loop length corresponding to the highest expected vibration frequency. This conclusion is realistic since conductor loop length increases with decreasing frequency.

2.3.1

Types of Dampers

There are various types of dampers, but the commonly used types in North America are the Stockbridge, torsional, and Hydro Quebec dampers. 2.3.1.1 Stockbridge Dampers:

Stockbridge damper, invented by George H. Stockbridge in 1925, is a dumbbell-shaped device with a mass at the ends of a short flexible cable or rod called the messenger cable. The damping mechanism is observed as vibrations of the conductor are transferred through the clamp to the messenger cable. The flexuring of the messenger causes slipping between its strands and consequently induces the weights at their ends to oscillate. By carefully choosing the parameters of the damper (such as the mass of the blocks, the length and the stiffness of the messenger), the impedance of the damper would coincide with that of the conductor. Thus, the energy imparted to the conductor from the wind is then greatly dissipated by the Stockbridge damper. It is claimed in the Stockbridge damper patent that a shorter (i.e., 30 in or 75 cm) and very flexible messenger increases damping effectiveness. Furthermore, the use of concrete or similar material for the weights in lieu of metallic weight was recommended since no charging current is absorbed by concrete material [16]. This idea was quickly rejected because of the poor mechanical performance of concrete. There are many types of Stockbridge dampers. The first Stockbridge damper as patented by George Stockbridge had a concrete block at each end of the messenger and it is shown in Figure 2.3.

13

Figure 2.3: Stockbridge's original concrete block design [16].

Modern dampers use metal bell-shaped weights as shown in Figure 2.4. The bell is hollow and the damper cable is fixed internally to the distal end, which permits relative motion between the cable and damping weights. The modern Stockbridge damper has two types of dampers, the 2R damper and 4R damper. The former, 2R damper, is also known as the symmetric Stockbridge damper and it has identical weights and messengers at both ends. Given that this damper consists of two identical weights, the moment exerted by one is neutralized by the other. The 2R damper is characterized to possess two natural modes of vibration when the motion of the clamp is restricted to the vertical plane. The second type, 4R damper, also called the asymmetric Stockbridge damper, has weights and cable lengths that are different on both sides. Consequently, a resultant moment is induced by the unbalanced weights at the ends, which results in a wider range of frequencies that include four resonant frequencies. The messenger of the Stockbridge damper as shown in Figure 2.5 is generally made of galvanized steel, but stainless steel is used in more polluted areas. Both materials result in the same damping capacity; however, stainless steel provides better fatigue resistance. The clamp is made of aluminum alloy in order to ensure that the weight is small enough to restrict its motion to the vertical plane for higher conductor vibration

14

frequencies. In the past, damper counterweights were made of zinc alloy, but due to the rise in cost of this material, forged steel weights or extruded steel rods are used instead.

Figure 2.4: Stockbridge damper [1].

Figure 2.5: Stockbridge damper cable [1].

2.3.1.2

Torsional Dampers:

Based on the patent of Buchanan and Tebo [17], a torsional damper consists of a sleeve carrying two weights and each weight is located at one end (Figure 2.6). The torsional damper is connected to the conductor through a rubber bushing. Each weight produces a moment since its center of gravity is eccentric to the axis of the

15

conductor and the combination of these two moments result in a torsional force at the end of the conductor. This torsional force being applied on the conductor converts the energy of the vibrating conductor into inter-strand frictional losses.

Figure 2.6: Torsional damper [17].

2.3.1.3

Hydro Quebec Dampers:

This type of damper is similar to the asymmetric Stockbridge damper except that the Hydro Quebec damper is devoid of a messenger and is not hollow in its counterweights (Figure 2.7). In this damper, the messenger wire is replaced by a dissipating and flexible element, which consists of an elastomeric cylinder.

16

Figure 2.7: Hydro Quebec damper [2].

2.3.2

Dynamics of the Stockbridge Damper

Wagner et al. [18] studied the dynamic response of a Stockbridge damper. The authors assumed that the Stockbridge damper has a massless messenger and a rigid mass attached at the tip. Their assumption of a massless messenger is reasonable since the mass of the damper is much larger than the mass of the messenger. Only one mass was studied because the two masses of the damper were equal, so symmetry was used for simplification and the clamp motion was modeled as a base motion. This paper presented the equation of motion of the Stockbridge damper (equation 2.3) and its response. Then, it validated the theoretical analysis through experiment. Both results were in agreement since their assumption of the Stockbridge damper being a two degree of freedom was justified experimentally by the existence of two distinct modes.

17

The equation of motion was given as: Mx ¨ + Kx  + Cx = K y  + Cy (2.3)

where M is the mass matrix, K is the damper coefficient matrix, C is the stiffness matrix, x is the vertical displacement of the messenger, and y is the displacement vector at the clamp. Another investigation on the assessment of the dynamics of Stockbridge damper was conducted by Markiewicz [19]. In his paper, a method and a computational model were presented for the evaluation of the optimum dynamic characteristics of Stockbridge dampers to be mounted near tension insulator assemblies (dead end span). He suggested that Stockbridge dampers be designed so that their mechanical impedance matches as closely as possible to the determined optimum damper impedance for the cable to be protected. However, the optimum design is evaluated assuming that the cable is clamped at both ends. Therefore, the Stockbridge damper is only efficient for suspension span. Futhermore, Krispin [20] outlined the advantage of a Stockbridge-type vibration damper with low mass clamp over a conventional Stockbridge vibration damper with bolted clamp. Using theoretical and experimental analysis, it was shown that the conventional Stockbridge has a shortcoming in damping high frequency vibrations of small diameter optical ground wires (OPGW) due to their high clamp mass. Therefore, low clamp mass dampers, compared to conventional bolted clamp dampers, improve power dissipation (damping performance) in the upper range frequencies. Vecchiarelli [21] showed experimentally that the energy dissipated by a Stockbridge damper varies highly with the vibration frequency and the displacement amplitude of the damper clamp. The displacement of the damper clamp depends on the location of the damper. Therefore, the energy dissipated by the damper can be significantly affected by the positioning of the damper.

18

2.3.3

Damper Location

As mentioned earlier, the efficiency of the damper depends significantly on its positioning. A rule of thumb is used to determine this location and the most important point is to avoid positioning the damper at a node where the vibration amplitude is zero. Hence, the damper would not be efficient. This rule considers the location of the damper at a distance P (equation 2.4) between 70 and 80% of the loop length (equation 2.5), corresponding to the highest wind speed of 7 m/s [1]. P = 0.31d H w (2.4)

where H and w are the conductor tension and mass per unit length, respectively. And d denotes the diameter of the conductor. l= 2.703 d Vw H w (2.5)

where l = loop length (m), Vw = wind velocity (m/s), d = conductor diameter (m), w = conductor mass per meter (kg/m) Nigol and Houston [11] established optimum locations of dampers and made recommendations to never place dampers at any point of symmetry along the conductor (i.e, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, etc.). Otherwise the dampers fail to provide vibration protection at every 4th , 3rd , and 2nd harmonic [11]. One damper can be placed at a distance x1 (1.2 to 1.8 m) for frequencies of 40-50 Hz and for normal design tensions. For longer span and/or higher tension, two dampers shall be used at distances x1 (2.4 to 3.6 m) and x2 (1.0 to 2.2 m) from the two terminals. When more than one damper is used the ratio x2 /x1 shall be 0.4 or 0.6. Dhotard, and Ganesan [3] showed that the amplitude of vibration does not depend on the cable length, but only on the location of the damper. An increase in the number of dampers leads to an increase in the displacement in the major frequency range. The authors also compared asymmetric and symmetric dampers. They concluded that unlike symmetric dampers, asymmetric dampers create a resultant moment due to the inequality or unbalance of its two masses, but this moment has negligible effect 19

on vibration of the cable.

2.3.4

Wind Modeling

Strouhal and Von Karman1 are the first authors to investigate uniform flow of air across a rigid cylinder. The nature of the flow depends on the Reynolds number, which is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces (equation 2.6). With respect to Aeolian vibration, Reynolds number varies between 2700 and 14000 [22]. Re = VD v (2.6)

where V is the wind velocity, D is the diameter of the conductor and v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. Aeolian vibration is caused by alternating vortices. As the vortices are shed from the surface of the conductor normal to the wind, they cause a resultant force that acts in the transverse direction. This force is periodic with a frequency fs , which is related to the diameter of the conductor and the wind velocity as follows: fs = sV D (2.7)

where s is the Strouhal number and it varies from 0.15 to 0.25. In general the average Strouhal value is taken as 0.2. It is noted that the conductor becomes very excited as the Strouhal frequency approaches some of its natural frequencies and this phenomena is called resonance. While studying the lift force that acts on a rigid cylinder during vibration, Diana and Falco [23] found that this force behaves similarly to the vibration response since they are both harmonic at steady state . This conclusion was verified by Bishop and Hassan [24] and by Bearman and Currie [25]. All the authors agreed that during resonance the lift force leads the displacement by a phase angle ranging from 0-180

degrees. Both the lift force and the cylinder response are represented as follows: F (t) = Fl sin(t + ) (2.8)

X (t) = Ac sin(t)

(2.9)

where Fl is the lift force and  is the forcing frequency in rad/s.  is the phase angle between the response x(t) and wind force F (t). It should be noted that the forcing frequency is the Strouhal frequency. The lift force is defined as follows: 1 Fl = Cl DLV 2 2 (2.10)

where D and L are the diameter and length of the cylinder, respectively. V and  is the velocity and density of the fluid, respectively. Cl is the lift coefficient. Griffin and Koopmann [26] showed experimentally that this lift coefficient depends on the ratio of the maximum amplitude of vibration to the diameter of a rigid cylinder (Ac /Dcyl ). Their conclusion was that a maximum lift of 0.55 experienced a maximum vibration amplitude of 0.55 diameters, peak-to-peak. And any cylinder with a maximum amplitude above or below this value experienced lift coefficient Cl of 0.28-0.33.

2.4

Energy Balance Method

The energy balance method is the most popular concept used to predict the vibration of transmission lines. This method states that the energy transfered by the wind to the conductor is dissipated by the conductor self-damping and the dampers. The mathematical interpretation is given below: Pw = Pd + P c (2.11)

21

where Pw is the wind power, Pd is power dissipated in the damper, and Pc is power dissipated in the conductor. Most researches on Aeolian vibration used the power method to solve for the amplitude of vibration. Kraus and Hagedorn [27] studied the level of vibration using the energy balance method and compared the results to those obtained from a wind tunnel experiment. It should be noted that the energy balance method is only valid when the conductor is vibrating at resonance. Therefore, the amplitude of vibration is maximum and it is determined when the forcing frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the conductor. Furthermore, this method ignores the flexural rigidity of the conductor and determines the wind power input and the power dissiapated by the damper in terms of the antinodal displacement amplitude. The power dissipated in the conductor is given as: Pc = K 2 f
(n+m)

(2.12)

where K2 , n, m are constants that are determined through experiment. A, D, and L, are the maximum amplitude of vibration, diameter of the conductor, and the span length, respectively. From laboratory measurements on a rigid cylinder, the wind input is given by: Pw = Lf 3 D4 F A D (2.13)

where F (A/D) depends on the maximum amplitude of vibration and the diameter of the conductor. The power dissipated by the damper is given in Ref. [3] as: 1 Pd = Fa Ua sin() 2 (2.14)

where Fa is the force transmitted to the cable by the damper. Ua is the maximum amplitude, so it is the same as Ac in equation 2.9.  denotes the phase angle and  represents the driving frequency.

22

A well established energy balance method was implemented by Verma and Hagedorn [28] to optimize the position of Stockbridge dampers along the span. It was analytically determined that two successive dampers should be placed apart at a maximum distance of 1 m. This ensures that both dampers will not be simultaneously located on nodes for any natural frequency of the system under 50 Hz. It was also observed that the maximum strain and the amplitude of vibration are kept within the permissible limits when dampers are kept in the range of 0.22l to 0.25l% of the loop length. Agamenon et al. [29] also developed a dynamic model of Aeolian vibration to predict the amplitude of steady-state motion of the conductor based on the energy balance principle and a direct method for solving the resulting time-dependent NavierStokes equation. They showed that numerical simulation will be more realistic if a correlation between the tension and equivalent damping of the conductor can be obtained. The energy balance method is a very easy concept to implement with little computation once the combination of the dynamics of the conductor, damper, and wind is determined. However this method may lead to significant erroneous results because of its assumptions. One of the weaknesses of the energy method is the assumption of negligible flexural rigidity . This implies that the conductor is modeled as a string instead of a tensile beam. Consequently, it can considerably influence the amplitude of vibration for larger conductors which affects the bending stress at the clamps. Also, the maximum amplitude of vibration is always overestimated because of the negligible stiffness. Another weakness is that the energy balance method can only be implemented at resonance. While the amplitude of vibration is maximum at resonance, it is desirable to know how non-resonant frequencies influence the conductor vibration. Further, modeling the Stockbridge damper as a lump mass imparts a vertical inertia force at the attachment of the damper. In reality, however, this force is not always vertical, but remains normal to the messenger cable. As it can be inferred from equation 2.14, the flexural rigidity of the messenger is neglected even though its inclusion can alter

23

the overall natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system. Hence, the scope for assessing the mechanical behaviour of the damper is beyond the capability of the energy balance method.

3.1.1

Modeling of the Conductor Without Damper
Conductor Equation of Motion

The conductor is modeled as a simply supported beam with tension. The wind force per unit length f (x, t) is assumed to be perpendicular to the conductor (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1: Simply supported conductor.

The following assumptions are employed in deriving the equation of motion of the conductor (equation 3.6): 1. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is applicable since the ratio of the conductor length to its diameter is very small (L/D is greater than 20).

25

2. The mass per unit length, m, is uniform across the conductor span since its diameter is constant throughout the span. 3. The tension, T , is assumed to be uniform across the span for simplicity. It is known in practice that the tension varies from a maximum at the clamp ends to a minimum in the middle of the conductor. However, the variation is usually negligible for smaller and moderate span lengths. 4. The slope, , is very small since the amplitude of vibration is less than the conductor diameter. Hence the theory of small deformation is applicable. 5. The flexural rigidity, EI , is constant. This assumption is for mathematical simplicity because the flexural rigidity varies with the distance along the conductor. However, for most conductors the flexural rigidity is very small. Therefore, it does not have a significant effect on the conductor and hence the assumption of uniformity of the flexural rigidity is reasonable. Figure 3.2 depicts the free-body diagram of a differential element of the conductor with original length dx, where w(x, t) denote the transverse deflection. V (x, t), M (x, t), and T (x, t) denote the shear force, bending moment, and the tension at the left-end of the conductor element, respectively. V (x + dx, t), M (x + dx, t), and T (x + dx, t) are the shear force, bending moment, and tension of the element on the right-end of the element, respectively.

Figure 3.2: A cut in the beam.

Since the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is applicable, the shear force, moment, and 26

slope are given by: V (x, t) = -EI  3w x3 M (x, t) = EI  2w x2 = w x (3.1)

Applying Newton's law of motion,

F = ma leads to the following:

V (x + dx, t) + T (x + dx, t) sin( + d) - V (x, t) - T (x, t) sin  + f (x, t)dx = Adx Recall Taylor Series: g (x + dx) = g (x) + (dx)g (x) + (dx)2 g (x)... where g = d2 g dg and g = 2 . dx dx Using the Taylor series expression, equation 3.2 can be written as:  2w dV (x, t) d(T (x, t) sin ) + + f (x, t) = A 2 dx dx t

 2w t2 (3.2)

(3.3)

Observe that A = m, the mass per unit length, where A is the cross-sectional area and  is the density of the conductor. Since  is small  sin   = . Substituting this into equation 3.3 leads to: dV (x, t) d(T (x, t))  2w + + f (x, t) = m 2 dx dx t For a constant tension in the beam, equation 3.4 becomes: dV (x, t) d  2w +T + f (x, t) = m 2 dx dx t (3.5) (3.4)

Substituting (3.1) into (3.5) and multiplying (3.5) by (-1) leads to the fourth order differential equation below:  4w  2w  2w  EI 4 - T 2 - f (x, t) = -m 2 x x t (3.6)

Equation 3.6 is the equation of motion of the conductor without dampers under Aeolian vibration.

3.1.2

Theoretical Natural Frequency

The natural frequency of the conductor is determined from a free vibration analysis. Assume that the transverse deformation w(x, t) can be written as: w(x, t) = y (t)g (x) where y (t) = A1 sin(t + ) and g (x) = ezx Substituting (3.8) and (3.9) into (3.7) yields: y (t)EI d2 y (t) d2 g (x) d4 g (x) + mg ( x ) - T y ( t ) =0 dx4 dt2 dx2 (3.9) (3.8) (3.7)

Since the term on the right and the left side depend on t and x, respectively, both must equal a constant. Let the constant be  2 . 1 d2 y (t) = 2 y (t) dt2 d2 y (t)  = -y (t) 2 2 dt

Since d1 , d2 , d3 , and d4 are nonzero, hence the matrix must be singular and therefore its determinant is zero.

Modeling the Conductor with a Stockbridge Damper

All the assumptions made in section 3.1 are also applicable in this section. The cable of the damper (messenger) is assumed to behave as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The clamp is assumed to be rigid and fixed to the conductor, which means that the height, h (length of the clamp plate) is always perpendicular to the conductor at its point of attachment. Figures 3.3 and 3.4 show the positioning of all the points of interest for the derivation of kinetic energy and potential energy. The positioning of the counterweight of the damper on the right side is shown in Figure 3.4. That for the weight on the left-end is omitted for brevity, but both are similar except that the subscript r which denotes the right-side is replaced by l to denote the left-side.

Position Vectors

The position vectors of the conductor, the location of the damper, the mass of the damper, and the messenger are described below: The position vector of a deformed differential element of the conductor is written as: rc (x, t) = x^ i0 + w(x, t)^ j0 If the point of attachment of the damper is x = Ld , then
 rc = Ld^ i0 + w(Ld , t)^ j0

Note that rmr(1) represents the position of the right-end counterweight with respect to frame 1, F1 . Also, from Figure 3.4 it can be seen that rlr is the distance from frame 1, F1 , to frame 2, F2 , along ^ i1 and that similarly rll is from frame 1, F1 , to frame 2, F2 . The position vector rmr(0) becomes:
 rmr(0) = rgr + rgmr + rc

(3.18)

Similarly, the position vector of the counterweight on the left-side is as follows:
 rml(0) = rgl + rgmr + rc

(3.19)

The position vectors of the messenger on the right and left sides are:
 rmmr = rc + rh + xmm^ i1 + wdr (xmm , t)^ j1  rmml = rc + rh + xmm^ i1 + wdl (xmm , t)^ j1

(3.20) (3.21)

Velocity Vectors

The velocity vectors are found by taking the derivative of the position vectors with respect to time. c = w r  c (x, t)^ j0
  = w r c (x, t)^ j0 c

(3.22) (3.23)

h is the relative velocity vector of the clamp and it is defined as: Note that r h =  1 k ^ × h^ 1 h^ r j1 =  i1 where 1 is the rotation angle of frame 1, F1 , with respect to F0 . Hence the velocity vectors are expressed as:
 ^   lr = Lgr  1^ r j1 + w  dr j1 + wdr 1 ^   ll = -Lgl  1^ r 1 j1 + w  dl j1 + wdl

gmr = r × rgmr r gml = l × rgml r Using the equations above, the velocity vectors of the right and left side of the counterweights are as follows:

 where wc is the displacement of the conductor at xc = Ld , wdr is the vertical displace-

ment of the messenger at xr = Lgr (Lgr is the length of the messenger on the right),
 and wdl is the vertical displacement of the messenger at xl = Lgl (Lgl is the length of

the messenger on the left). Expressing unit vectors of frame 1, F1 , with respect to those of frame 2, F2 , leads to: ^ i1 = cos1^ i0 - sin1^ j0 ^ j1 = sin1^ i0 + cos1^ j0

35

mr(1) can be expressed with respect to the fixed frame F0 and Using these equations, r
^  · r mr(1) = w 1 h(cos1^ 1 (-sin1^ c r jo · [ io + sin1^ jo ) - Lgr  io + cos1^ jo ) c    +w  dr (-sin1^ io + cos1^ jo ) + wdr 1 (cos1^ io + sin1^ jo ) + ( × rgmr )]

Hence the coupling between the conductor and the right-end mass becomes:
       · r mr(1) = w 1 cos1 + w wdr 1 sin1 cos1 + w c r c 1 hsin1 + w c Lgr   c w  dr c ^ +w c jo  × rgmr

mr(o) · r mr(o) and taking the integration Now, substituting the equations above into r of the resultant equation yields the KE of the right-end mass which may be written as: Tmr = Note that

Finite Element Modeling

This section consists of two subsections. The first subsection deals with the finite element modeling of the conductor without a damper and the second includes the damper. The field variable is interpolated along the span of the structure using cubic Lagrange interpolation shape functions [30]. These cubic shape functions, , are also known as Hermite shape functions and are defined as: 3 2 + 2 L2 L3 2 3   3 = 3 2 - 2 3 L L 1 = 1 - 3 2 =  - 2 2 3 + 2 L L 2 3 4 = - + 2 L L

Finite Element Modeling of the Conductor Without Damper

The representation of the finite element model of the conductor without damper is depicted in Figure 3.5. The element consists of two nodes and each node consists of two degrees of freedom to match with the hermit shape functions described previously.

3.3.2

Finite Element Modeling of the Conductor With the Damper

In this section, the kinetic and potential energies derived in section 3.2 are used in conjunction with the Hamilton's principle to derive the stiffness and mass matrices of the element of the conductor with a damper. The finite element of the conductor with the damper is delineated in Figure 3.6. This element consists of fives nodes, two for the conductor and three for the messenger. Initially, the messenger consisted of four nodes, two each on the left-side and right-side. However, a node on both sides coincide at the point of contact of the messenger with the clamp. Hence, these two nodes were merged, resulting in three nodes for the messenger. Overall, the size of the element matrices of the conductor with a damper resulted in a 10x10 matrix since each node consists of two degrees of freedom.

Figure 3.6: Schematic of finite element of the conductor with damper.

The displacement of the conductor, the right-side damper, and the left-side damper

45

are written as follows: wc = c T qc wdr = dr T qdr wdl = dl T qdl (3.63)

where the s represent the elemental mode shape vectors and the q s represent the elemental displacement vectors. The subscripts c, dr, and dl denote the conductor, the damper on the right, and the damper on the left, respectively. Note that the superscript T denotes matrix transpose. The slopes are defined as wc  = c T qc 1 = x wdr  2 = = dr T qdr x wdl  = dl T qdl 3 = x

(3.64)

  where  c represents the elemental mode shapes vector at x = Ld , dr and dl repre-

sents the elemental mode shapes vectors at xr = Lgr and xl = Lgl , respectively.

Observe that the potential energy and the work by the weight involve only the virtual displacement whereas, the kinetic energy involves both virtual displacement and virtual velocity. Therefore, in order to derive the equation of motion, the virtual velocity must be transformed to virtual displacement through integration by parts of the kinetic energy. Recall integration by parts: udv = uv | - vdu. Whereupon, in this case, the uv term equals zero because of the auxiliary condition that states t1 and t2 are known. To this end, carrying out the integration by parts of the variation of the kinetic energy and rearranging and factorizing by qc , qdr , and qdl , respectively, leads to

Chapter 4 Dynamic of Single Conductor Without Damper
4.1 Description of the Matlab Codes

This section describes the MATLAB codes (Appendix B.1). The overall codes consists of 5 subroutines, a main function for the free vibration, and a main function for the simulation. The subroutines and the main functions are described as follows: 1. Matrix KM is the subroutine where the mass and the stiffness matrices are computed. It consists of the mass and stiffness matrices of the element damper (MD and KD ) and the mass and stiffness matrix of the element without damper (M , K ). 2. Assemble KM this subroutine assembles the element mass and stiffness matrices. The output is a global mass and stiffness matrices and the size of these matrices depends on the number of element considered. 3. Apply BC is the subroutine used for applying boundary conditions. 4. Free vibration calls all the subroutines described above and then computes the natural frequencies.

56

5. Linearize : This subroutine is used as a state space equation to convert the second order ODE (ordinary differential equation) to the first order ODE so that the function ode45 can be used in the subroutine Mainsimulation. 6. Mainsimulation : This subroutine determines the response of the system.

Modal Analysis
Description of the Conductor Characteristics

The parameters used for the purpose of the modal analysis are taken from Ref. [10] in order to allow the comparison of the obtained simulation results to the corresponding experimental results. The conductor has the following characteristics: 1. Mass per unit length, m = 0.8127 kg/m. 2. Flexural rigidity EImin = 11.07 N.m2 . 3. Mechanical load (tension) in the cable, T = 15860 N and 10700 N . 4. Three span lengths were considered, L = 13.385 m, 32.3 m, and 65.355 m. It should be noted that the minimum flexural rigidity is used in all computations for the sake of safety since the worst case scenario of having a failure would result for EImin . 4.1.1.2 Methodology and Results

With respect to the finite element results, the mass and stiffness matrices derived in chapter 3 are incorporated in the MATLAB codes. For the purpose of validating the model, the simply supported boundary condition is employed. The first five natural frequencies are tabulated in Table 4.1. The exact or theoretical natural frequencies are obtained using equation 3.14. As it can be seen, the natural frequencies found from the finite element method are identical to those established from the exact solution. The percentage of error for the 13.385 m span length is 1% and the remaining two span lengths resulted in no error. 57

Mode 1 2 3 4 5

In Ref. [10], a prototype of the overhead transmission lines testing was performed. The experimental data were obtained using five accelerometers placed along the cable at L/2, 3L/8, L/4, L/8, and L/16 with a system excitation from an impact hammer. The first five natural frequencies of the three span lengths found experimentally are tabulated in the table below.

The comparison of the experimental and the finite element results is illustrated in Figure 4.1. From this figure, it is evident that both results are very close. The percentage error for 13.385 m, 32.3 m, and 65.335 m span lengths is found to be 1.21%, 1.3%, and 0.32%, respectively. The discrepancies in the results are due to the fact that the non-linearity effect and the conductor torsion were not accounted in the mathematical formulation.

4.2.1

Forced Vibration Analysis
Conductors Selection and Transmission Lines Condition

Two common conductors used for transmission lines with very different characteristics are selected. The conductor 240/40 sq.mm ACSR (26/7) and 1840 Kcmil drake ACSR (72/7) are choosen from the EPRI handbook [1]. The first conductor would be used in both parts of the analysis since its diameter falls within the range of the Stockbridge damper requirements. The second conductor is only used in the first part to verify the dynamics of the conductor with higher flexural rigidity. With respect to the applied force, it was indicated in chapter two that the wind force applied on the conductor can be approximated by equation 2.8 since past investigations have shown that the conductor behaves as a rigid cylinder. Hence, the force by unit span length is calculated for each conductor using this equation and taking the average value of the lift coefficient to be 0.3 and the density of air to be approximately 1.2 kg/m3 at 200 C . Should this lift coefficient of 0.3 be used, the 59

maximum amplitude of vibration cannot exceed the diameter of the conductor. It is important to note that the expression of the wind force Fl is in terms of the wind speed and it is the amplitude of the sinusoidal wind force in equation 2.8. The span length for a typical transmission line can vary from 100-1000 m, and a span length of 372 m is used in this analysis. Conductor 240/40 sq.mm ACSR (26/7) consists of 26 strands of aluminum with a diameter of 3.439 mm/strand and 7 strands of steel with a diameter of 2.675 mm/strand. This conductor has the following characteristics: 1. Mass per unit length, m = 0.987 kg/m. 2. Overall diameter, D = 21.9 mm. 3. Rated tensile strength, RT S = 86, 400 N (20% RT S = 17280 N ; 25% RT S = 21600 N ). 4. Minimum flexural rigidity, EImin = 16 N m2 . 5. Maximum safe bending amplitude at 25% RT S , and 20% RT S with Ybsaf e = 0.310 mm, and 0.3 mm, respectively. 6. Applied lift force per unit length, Fl = 0.00378v 2 (N/m) (where v is the wind speed in m/s) for v = 7 m/s , Fl = 0.18522 N/m. Conductor 1840 Kcmil drake ACSR (72/7) is one of the conductors that possesses the highest flexural rigidity and mass per unit length. It consists of 72 strands of aluminum with a diameter of 4.407 mm/strand and 7 strands of steel with a diameter of 2.068 mm/strand. The remaining characteristics of this conductor are: 1. Mass per unit length, m = 2.91 kg/m. 2. Overall diameter, D = 44.069 mm. 3. Rated tensile strength, RT S = 200, 600 N (20% RT S = 40120 N ; 25% RT S = 50150 N ).

60

4. Minimum flexural rigidity, EImin = 97.11 N m2 . 5. Maximum safe bending amplitude at 25% RT S , Ybsaf e = 0.170 mm. 6. Applied lift force per unit length, Fl = 0.007932v 2 (N/m), for v = 7 m/s, Fl = 0.3886 N/m.

4.2.2

Simulation Results

Both conductors are only excited for higher modes since the Strouhal frequencies (for a wind speed varying 1 to 7 m/s) obtained for 240/40 sq.mm ACSR and 1840 Kcmil conductors varies from 9.52 to 66.666 Hz, and 4.53 to 31.75 Hz, respectively. The first mode of the 240/40 sq.mm ACSR (26/7) that fell within the range of the Strouhal frequency is found to be the 52nd mode with a frequency of 9.46 Hz. While the first excitation mode for the second conductor is the 29th mode with a frequency of 4.609 Hz. The wind velocity responsible for the first resonant frequency is, indeed, 1 m/s for both conductors. For the purpose of determining the wind force, the velocity of the wind is taken to be 7 m/s. The highest uniform wind pressure is the worst case scenario since this resulted in the highest displacement. Hence the applied wind pressure is fixed for both conductors and it is determined to be 0.18522 N/m and 0.3886 N/m for the 240/40 sq.mm and 1840 Kcmil conductors, respectively. The 240/40 sq.mm is considered first. Using the 20% rated tensile strength (RTS) condition, the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude is found to be 8.498 mm, 3.626 mm, and 1.175 mm for a frequency of 9.46 Hz, 21.979 Hz, and 66.66 Hz, respectively. The 25% RTS condition is also evaluted and it is determined that the first resonant frequency results in a peak-to-peak amplitude of 7.91 mm and the last resonant frequency produces a value of 1.056 mm. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 show the normalized amplitude of vibration with respect to the diameter (Ymax /D). From Figure 4.2 it is apparent that the normalized displacemnt is less than 0.2, implying that the amplitude of vibration is less than the diameter of the conductor by almost an order of magnitude, which is in agreement with the conclusion found in the literature. 61

With respect to 1840 Kcmil conductor at 20% RTS, the maximum peak-to-peak displacement across the conductor is determined to be 14.43 mm and 2.01 mm for the first and last resonant frequencies, respectively. Also, the conductor displays a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4.92 mm when it is excited at a resonant frequency of 13.017 Hz. Using the 25% RTS condition, the peak-to-peak amplitude is found to be 12.68 mm, 4.411 mm, and 1.80 mm with respect to the three natural frequencies listed previously. Figure 4.3 shows that the maximum normalized amplitude of vibration is less than 0.3. An investigation is done on the 1840 Kcmil conductor to determine how the amplitude of vibration changes with respect to the span length. Three lengths are considered 300 m, 200 m, and 100 m. The peak-to-peak amplitude of vibration, ymax , corresponding to these three span lengths are determined to be 11.718 mm, 8.455 mm, and 4.418 mm, respectively. It is evident from Figure 4.4 that the normalized displacement decreases with decreasing span length. This fact is intuitive and in agreement with the literature. Thus, a shorter span is less susceptible to Aeolian Vibration than a longer span. Furthermore, the effect of the tension was examined on the 240/40 sq.mm conductor. This is done by inspecting the amplitude of vibration at the midpoint for 10%, 20%, and 35% RTS while keeping the span length of the conductor and the forcing frequency fixed. The 10% RTS condition results in the highest amplitude of vibration and this value is less than one-half of the diameter of the conductor. As shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6, the maximum amplitude of vibration increases with decreasing tension for both high and low forcing frequencies. This is not surprising since the stiffness of the cable increases with increasing tension.

4.2.3

Bending Amplitude

Recall that the bending stress is proportional to the bending amplitude. Hence in order to predict whether the conductor is safe, it suffices to determine the conductor bending amplitude and compare it to the specified limit. This bending amplitude is usually measured at a distance of 89 mm from the suspension clamp and it is given as Yb = Ymax sin(0.089n/L) [21] where n is the mode number and L is the span (L/n is the loop length). For the 240/40 sq.mm conductor, the bending amplitude is determined to be 0.319 mm for 20% RTS. Note that this value corresponds approximately to the 52nd mode (9.46 Hz) which resulted in the highest maximum amplitude. The bending amplitude of the 1840 kcmil conductor is found to be 0.496 mm corresponding to the 29th mode for 25% RTS. The safe bending amplitudes are given as Ybsaf e = 0.316 mm at 20% RTS for 240/40 sq.mm conductor, and Ybsaf e = 0.17 mm at 25% RTS for 1840 Kcmil conductor. Comparing the calculated bending amplitudes to the safe bending amplitude, it is concluded that neither conductor is safe when dampers are not attached. Overall, the bending stress (bending amplitude) would exceed the endurance limit (safe bending) resulting in fatigue damage. 65

Chapter 5 Numerical Analysis of a Single Conductor Plus Dampers
5.1 Free Vibration Analysis

This section examines the validation of the mathematical model by comparing the natural frequencies obtained from MATLAB to those obtained using the commercial finite element analysis software, ANSYS.

5.1.1

Validation of the Model

A free vibration analysis is performed in ANSYS to validate the finite element model of the conductor with a damper. For the purpose of validating the model, the same parameters for the conductor used in section 4.1.1 are employed both in MATLAB and ANSYS. The damper has the following characteristics: EI = 3.19 N/m2 ; mdr = 4 kg and mdl = 2.75 kg (mass of damper on right and left) ; Adr = Adl = 0.2 kg/m (messenger mass per unit length on right and left); Ldr = Ldl = 0.2 m; h = 0.05 m (height of clamp). The damper was placed at distance of 4.1 m from the left end of the conductor.

66

5.1.1.1

Simulation in ANSYS

Both the conductor and the messenger are modeled using BEAM3 element, which is a two dimensional elastic beam element. The two counterweights at the ends are modeled as mass21 elements, which is a two dimensional mass with rotational inertia. The clamp is modeled as BEAM3, but it is assumed that its mass per unit length is negligible compared to that of the conductor and the messenger. The span length is 13.375 m and the damper is placed at a distance of 4.1 m from the first node. The tension is considered to be zero so that the effect of the damper properties on the natural frequency can be isolated. Fixed boundary conditions are applied at the first and last finite element nodes of the conductor span by restricting the displacements along the x and y axis and the rotation about the z axis . The first three modes are shown in Figures 5.1 to 5.3, the 10th and 15th mode are illustrated in Figure 5.5 and 5.6, and the 5th mode with a closer look at the damper motion is delineated in Figure 5.4. The remaining modes of interest are shown in Appendix A. Unlike in chapter 4, it is evident from the figures below that the existence of symmetry has been disturbed by the presence of the damper in the system. This implies that the maximum amplitude does not occur at mid-span with respect to the first mode; also the displacement of the mid-span is not zero for the second mode. Furthermore, Figure 5.2 indicates that the antinode on the right of the vibration node is greater than the one on the left. It is observed that the damper response starts occurring in the 5th mode as illustrated in Figure 5.4. Taking the results of Figures 5.5 and 5.6 into consideration, it is evident that the damper dissipates all the energy of the conductor on the left and right side of the damper, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that the 5th and the 10th mode of the system are, indeed, two of the resonant frequencies of the damper.

Numerical Analysis in MATLAB

The same procedure described in subsection 4.1.1 is performed in this section except that a damper is attached to the conductor. Table 5.1 compares the natural frequencies of the same conductor used in Ref. [10] with and without a damper. The addition of the damper in the span decreases the natural frequencies of the system. This is not surprising as it is known that natural frequency is inversely proportional to the mass.

Table 5.2 shows the results of the first six natural frequencies and the 10th natural frequency obtained through both simulation methods. The first 20 natural frequencies versus the mode numbers of both MATLAB and ANSYS are plotted in Figure 5.7. It is apparent from this figure that the results are very similar. The average percentage error is found to be 1.02%. The discrepancy associated with the results is due in part to the assumption that the clamp has negligible mass and stiffness. Both mass and stiffness are taken into consideration in ANSYS finite element analysis. However, since the length of the clamp is very small (0.05 m) compared to the length of the messenger (0.35 m) and to the conductor (13.375 m), the error is insignificant.

5.1.2

Effect of the Mass and the Location of the Damper on the Natural Frequency

The conductor 240/40 sq.mm from section 4.2.1 is employed hereafter. The characteristics of the damper are as follows [31]: 1. The minimum flexural rigidity EImin = 3.19 N/m2 2. Messenger mass per unit length, m = 0.498 kg 72

3. Length of the messenger on one side l = 0.15 - 0.2 m 4. Mass of the counterweight, mdr or mdl varies from 0.856 to 4 kg 5. Counterweight mass moment of inertia, Idr or Idl varies from 0.001814 to 0.00741 kgm2 The natural frequencies are determined for four different cases as illustrated in Figure 5.8. It is plausible that the natural frequencies are not considerably affected when one damper is attached to the conductor because the tension is very large compared to the damper parameters. However, when two dampers are attached, the natural frequencies above 50 Hz tend to diminish considerably.

Figure 5.8: Effect of damper properties on the natural frequencies.

5.2

Force Vibration Analysis

The force vibration analysis is presented in two subsections. The first subsection deals with the response of the conductor with one damper attached and the second deals with the conductor response when two dampers are positioned on the conductor. 73

5.2.1

Response of the Conductor With One Damper

As mentioned above, the 240/40 sq.mm was selected for the purpose of the numerical analysis, so the applied wind force is the same as that calculated in section 4.2.1 (Fl = 0.18522 N/m). In the first part of this subsection, the effect of the damper mass on the response is established. The second part deals with the impact of the vibration frequency on the response. Finally, the effect of the damper location is examined in the last section. It is important to note that the figures in this section also show the peak-to-peak displacement normalized with respect to the diameter, Y . The normalized peak-topeak amplitudes at the finite element nodes of interest are describes as: 1. Y2 denotes the normalized peak-to-peak amplitude evaluated at the second finite element node. 2. Yf represents the normalized peak-to-peak amplitude evaluated at the penultimate finite element node. 3. Ymax is the finite element node corresponding to the maximum normalized vibration amplitude along the conductor. 4. Ymid corresponds to the normalized peak-to-peak amplitude at the mid-span. 5. Yd is the normalized peak-to-peak amplitude of the damper clamp. 6. Ydr denotes the normalized peak-to-peak amplitude of the right side counterweight. 7. Ydl is the normalized peak-to-peak amplitude of the left side counterweight. 5.2.1.1 Effect of the Damper Mass

In this section, the damper is positioned at a distance Ld = 1.1 m. The response along the conductor was determined by varying the mass of the damper from 0.856 to 4 kg.

74

The peak-to-peak amplitude at various points along the conductor versus the total damper mass is shown in Figure 5.9. This figure shows that the conductor maximum vibration amplitude slightly increases as the damper mass becomes larger, but the mid-span displacement amplitude, Ymid , is almost constant. Further, Y2 increases linearly with the damper mass, whereas Yf decreases. Figure 5.10 shows that the peak-to-peak vibration amplitude of both counterweights also increases with increasing damper mass and the damper with the lowest mass results in the largest peak-to-peak amplitude. The peak-to-peak response along the conductor is illustrated in Figure 5.11. This figure shows that the amplitude of vibration peaks to a maximum at a point on the conductor and then decreases. Note that this point is the finite element node associated with the resonant mode. Furthermore, when the two counterweight masses are balanced, the amplitude of vibration is larger. This implies that a symmetric damper dissipates less energy than an asymmetric damper. Most importantly, Figure 5.11 shows that having the larger mass to either face the tower or the mid-span can slightly influence the vibration amplitude. The magnitude of the maximum displacement slightly increases when the larger counterweight is placed on the right side facing the mid-span. Thus, it is preferable to face the larger counterweight to the tower albeit doing so does not significantly reduce the maximum vibration amplitude.

Effect of the Forcing Frequency on the Response

This section describes the effect of the vibration frequency on the conductor response when a damper is attached at Ld = 0.898 and 5 m. The mass of the damper on the right and left side are taken to be 0.856 and 1.5 kg, respectively. The remaining properties are the same as those in section 5.1.2. Figures 5.12 and 5.14 show that the amplitudes of vibration, Ymax and Ymid , decrease with increasing vibration frequency. On the other hand, the displacement amplitudes, Y2 and Yf , can increase, decrease, or remain constant as the vibration frequency is increased. The amplitude of vibration of the damper is shown in Figures 5.13 and 5.15 for Ld = 0.898 and 5 m, respectively. The plots in these figures display the same trends. The damper vibration amplitude increases with the forcing frequency. This can be explained by noting that Stockbridge dampers dissipate the most energy at higher vibration frequencies. Overall, it can be concluded that vibration amplitude throughout the conductor span length decreases as the excitation frequency increases.

5.2.1.3

Effect of the Damper Location on the Response

The vibration response is determined for various damper locations Ld for three fixed frequencies f = 9.53, 14.0, and 41.45 Hz. The same damper properties from the previous section are used in this case. For a constant forcing frequency, f = 9.53 Hz, the results in Figure 5.16 indicates that Ymax is minimum as the location of the damper Ld is increased from 0.1 to 7 m, but it increases as Ld is greater than 7 m. The maximum normalized amplitude at the mid-span Ymid is also a minimum as the damper is moved from 0.1 to 7 m and increases monotonically when Ld is greater than 7 m. Furthermore, Figure 5.16 shows that the maximum normalized displacement of the second node and the penultimate node on the conductor are approximately the same for Ld = 5 to 7 m. Note that this range is within the range corresponding to the minimum Ymax value. When the conductor is excited at 9.53 Hz, it is evident that positioning the damper between 5 to 7 m reduces the maximum amplitude of vibration and stabilize the vibration along the conductor. It is important to note that this damper location range corresponds to 70 to 95% of the loop length with respect to the 9.53 Hz forcing frequency. Figure 5.17 shows that the maximum normalized displacement value is reduced for a constant vibration frequency of 14.0 Hz compared to Figure 5.16. However, the optimum damper location range is within the optimum range in Figure 5.16, Ld = 2.5 to 6.6 m. Figure 5.17 also shows that the mid-span amplitude remains relatively constant compared to the maximum amplitude. It was also apparent that the normalized displacements Y2 and Yf , approaches the same value for Ld = 6.6 m as illustrated in Figure 5.18. The optimum range corresponds to 51 to 133% of the loop length associated with this forcing frequency. For a constant forcing frequency of 41.45 Hz, Figure 5.19 shows a considerable drop in the normalized maximum displacement of the conductor. This figure also shows that the range of the optimum damper location corresponding to f = 41.45 Hz is within the optimum range determined in Figure 5.16 (Ld = 2.1 to 4.2 m). This range corresponds to 125 to 264% of the loop length associated with 41.45 Hz. With 80

respect to the mid-span amplitude and the amplitude near the ends, the observations from Figure 5.16 are in agreement with those from Figures 5.17, 5.18, 5.19, and 5.20. In Figures 5.21, 5.22, and 5.23, the normalized displacement of both counterweights for the three aforementioned forcing frequencies are illustrated. The results indicate that the normalized amplitude of both counterweights is maximal in the vicinity of the optimum damper location range. This is intuitive as it is evident that the dissipation energy of the damper increases with the displacement of the damper. Hence, this confirms that the efficiency of the damper is considerably dependent on the damper location. It should be noted that when the damper was positioned beyond 7 m, Ymax started increasing monotonically as illustrated in Figures 5.16, 5.17, and 5.19. This is because the damper is approaching the vibration node of the loop length (L52 = 7.15 m) corresponding to the dominant mode (f = 9.53 Hz); its efficiency diminishes and the maximum amplitude increases. Irrefutably, the optimum location of the damper varies with the forcing frequency. However, each vibration frequency considered in this section shows that the vibration amplitude reduces considerably when the damper is located within Ld = 2.5 to 4.2 m. To further improve our understanding of the effect of the damper location on the conductor motion, Figure 5.24 and Figure 5.25 depict the conductor and damper counterweight displacement, respectively, when the location of the damper is varied over the whole span length. Based on these plots, it is concluded that a damper is only efficient when it is located in the immediate vicinity of the span ends closer to the tower. The largest peak-to-peak vibration amplitude corresponding to the range Ld = 2.5 to 4.2 m is ymax = 6.338 mm. Hence, the corresponding bending amplitude is approximately yb = 0.248 mm. Note that this bending amplitude is less than the safe bending amplitude ysaf e = 0.332 mm. Therefore, the conductor would be certainly safer from fatigue damage by locating the damper within Ld = 2.5 to 4.2m.

Response of a Conductor with Two Dampers

The same damper properties from the previous section are also employed in this section. Further, the vibration frequency f = 9.53 Hz is selected and there is no need to examine the other two vibration frequencies employed in the previous section. Two dampers are always positioned symmetrically about the mid-span of the conductor. As illustrated in Figure 5.26, the normalized maximum displacement on the conductor dropped significantly as a result of attaching two dampers to the conductor. It is evident that Ymax follows a parabolic-like variation with Ld . It decreases monotonically as the location of the damper varies from Ld = 0 to 2.5 m and remains relatively constant for Ld = 2.5 to 5.5 m. Finally, it increases as the damper is placed beyond 5.5 m. Further, Figure 5.27 shows that the maximum displacement near both ends are minimum when the damper is approximately positioned at Ld = 5.5 m. Here, the damper tends to stabilize the vibration throughout the conductor. In Figure 5.28, the normalized counterweights vibration amplitudes of both dampers are delineated. It indicates that the normalized amplitudes of the two dampers are not always the same. Instead, the vibration amplitude of either damper can be greater or less than that of the other damper, depending on the location of the dampers. The lowest peak-to-peak conductor vibration amplitude, ymax , is 1.657 mm when the dampers are positioned at Ld1 = 2.6 m and Ld2 = 369.4 m. Whereas, the lowest ymax for one damper is determined to be 6.31 mm when the damper was positioned at 1.1 m. Comparing the two, it is evident that the use of two dampers, positioned at the best possible locations, would notably reduce the maximum vibration amplitude. Moreover, the conductor bending amplitude with respect to the two damper is found to be yb = 0.06225 mm, which is overly less than that when only one damper is used (yb = 0.247 mm). Most importantly, it is substantially less than the safe bending amplitude, ysaf e = 0.332 mm. Conclusively, the conductor would be much safer from fatigue failure when two dampers, with the best conductor-damper combination, are employed.

Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendation
6.1 Summary

This thesis is motivated by the past failures of the transmission lines due to Aeolian vibration. The elimination of these failures is part of the challenges line engineers encounter in controlling Aeolian vibration. Currently, the best method to control wind induced vibration is to attach Stockbridge dampers to the conductor. However, the effectiveness of the damper depends on both the damping properties and its location on the conductor. As such, this thesis dealt with the Aeolian vibration of a single conductor with dampers, specifically, the effect of the damper location and the damping properties. Aeolian vibration of a single conductor has been studied using the energy balance method, which states that the energy imparted by wind on the conductor is dissipated by the conductor self-damping and the damper. This method provides a good approximation of the maximum amplitude of vibration. However, it does not account for the two-way coupling between the conductor and the damper, the flexural rigidity of the conductor and damper, and the mass per unit length of the messenger. The proposed model takes these into consideration. The mathematical model was presented in chapter 3 where the potential and kinetic energy equations of the system were derived. These equations were then discretized using the finite element method to determine the equations of motion. In 90

the process of the formulation the following assumptions were made: 1. The conductor behaves as an Euler-Bernoulli beam with an axial force. 2. The displacement of the conductor is very small (less than the conductor diameter). 3. The tension, flexural rigidity, and mass per unit length are constant. 4. The system is linear. 5. Torsion in the conductor is negligible. 6. The messenger is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. 7. The damper counterweights are represented as lumped masses. These assumptions were justified in the mathematical formulation chapter. The overall formulation for the conductor with and without a damper was validated using the commercial finite element software ANSYS and the results in Ref. [10], respectively. Overall, both models were found to be valid with approximately 1% error. Once the mathematical formulation was validated, the response of the conductor was predicted and the effect of the damper on the conductor was studied. In the first part of the numerical analysis, the natural frequencies of two conductors, 240/40 sq. mm and 1840 kcmil, without damper were examined for different span lengths and tensions. Also, the effect of the forcing frequency, tension, and span length on the conductor response were studied. The important observations are: 1. The conductor flexural rigidity and mass per unit length can significantly alter the mode shapes. The natural frequency of the conductor increases with its flexural rigidity and decreases with its mass per unit length. 2. The natural frequency increases with tension and decreases as the span length increases. Consequently, higher span lengths can be excited with very low Strouhal frequency.

91

3. The maximum amplitude of a conductor without damper decreases monotonically as the span length decreases. Hence, longer spans are more susceptible to vibration. 4. The conductor becomes stiffer with increasing tension; as a result, the maximum amplitude decreases. But, this does not mean the conductor is safer from fatigue damage. Note that higher tension results in lower safe bending amplitude. So, by increasing the tension, the conductor bending amplitude can be much greater than the safe bending amplitude. Consequently, the conductor would be more vulnerable to fatigue failure. 5. The maximum relative vibration amplitude of a conductor with higher flexural rigidity is less than that with a lower flexural rigidity. 6. The location of the maximum displacement varies with the excitation frequency. When the conductor is excited with the first mode, the maximum displacement occurs in the mid-span. However, with respect to the second mode of excitation, the midpoint results in a minimal displacement. Also, symmetrical displacement about the mid-span is observed for the conductor without a damper. Hence, multiple maximum amplitudes of vibration can be obtained in this case. 7. With respect to the line conditions established in chapter 5, the bending amplitude of a conductor without a damper is less than the safe bending amplitude. Thus, a conductor without a damper would not be safer from fatigue failure. The second part of the simulation dealt with the response of the combination of the conductor with dampers. The effect of the damper mass, the forcing frequency, and the location of the damper were examined. The following observations were made: 1. Attaching a damper to the conductor, reduces the natural frequency. This reduction is insignificant when only one damper is used. However, the addition of another damper, considerably diminishes the higher natural frequencies.

92

2. Facing the larger counterweight mass toward the suspension clamp and the smaller mass toward the mid-span slightly reduces the amplitude of vibration. 3. A damper with two unbalanced counterweight masses resulted in smaller vibration amplitude. This is in agreement with the observation in the literature that asymmetric dampers are more efficient than the symmetric dampers. 4. The maximum vibration displacement of a conductor with dampers decreases with increasing vibration frequency. Whereas, the amplitude of the damper increases as the system is excited with higher frequency. Irrefutably, the damper is most efficient at higher vibration frequencies. 5. The presence of a damper does not necessarily reduce the vibration amplitude. When a damper is placed at a vibration node, it would be ineffective. As the damper is moved away from the vibration node, its efficiency increases. 6. The optimum damper positioning depends on the forcing frequency. This range tends to increase or decrease with increasing forcing frequency. 7. For lower vibration frequencies, the optimum range is approximately 70 to 95% of the loop length corresponding to the subject forcing frequency. Higher vibration frequencies can pertain to a percentage of loop length much higher than 100%. The vibration amplitude of the conductor notably reduces whereas the amplitude of the damper increases as the system is excited with higher frequency. Irrefutably, the damper is most efficient at higher vibration frequencies. 8. The maximum vibration amplitude of the conductor reduces as the damper is positioned within the optimum range, whereas the displacement of the damper increases. Hence, dampers are also very efficient within their optimum location range. 9. Attaching two dampers within their optimum damper location range reduces the amplitude of vibration by approximately ten times.

93

The presence of a damper on the conductor can be advantageous or disadvantageous. When the combination of the mass and the location of the damper are astutely chosen, the vibration amplitude would significantly reduce and the conductor vibration would stabilize. This would reduce the chance of the conductor from fatigue failure since the conductor bending amplitude would be much lower than the safe bending amplitude. On the other hand, when the location of the damper or the properties of the damper are not carefully chosen, the conductor may be more susceptible to fatigue failure.

6.1.1

Conclusion

The following conclusions are inferred: · It is important to include the flexural rigidity of the conductor, as well as the mass and flexural rigidity of the damper in the mathematical formulation. Note that these properties can significantly affect the maximum amplitude of vibration. · The mass of the counterweight should be carefully determined so that the damper is capable of dissipating the most energy imparted by the wind to the conductor. · Placing two dampers symmetrically at each end is better than attaching only one damper. · Always face the counterweight with the larger mass toward the insulator clamp and the lower counterweight mass toward the mid-span. · With respect to the optimum location of the damper, the rule of thumb mentioned from the literature review should not be used as it is not effective because it only pertains to a specific frequency. Instead, all the dominant vibration frequencies should be considered in order to examine the optimum location range. · The best optimum range to be predicted should correspond to the dominant frequency that resulted in the highest vibration amplitude. 94

Proposed Future Work

Further research in the subject topic could be listed as follows: · Investigate the mechanical behaviour of the messenger. · Conduct an experiment to validate the model of a single conductor with a damper. · Examine the variation of the flexural rigidity and the tension for longer span length. · Extend the developed model by including the non-linear terms, conductor selfdamping, and torsion. · Examine the coupling between the insulator and the conductor. · Develop a Finite Element model for bundle conductor by modeling the conductor and the spacer dampers as one system.

Once this element is found, the element mass and stiffness corresponding to the element with the damper is called and the assembly is done in four groups. The first group, the 4x4 matrix on the top left corner of the 10x10, is assembled. Next, this subroutine assembles the second group, which is the 4x6 on the top right corner. Then, the inverse of the 4x6, which is the 6x4 at the bottom left, is called for assemblage and finally the 6x6 on the left is assembled. The AssemleKM.m calls the element without the damper at every other time.
