Abstract
This study compared two acidic pretreatments on Source-Separated Organic (SSO) waste, preprocessed by Aufbereitungs Technology and System thermal-screw, on the basis of fermentable sugars for bioethanol production. The result showed that the SSO contained on average 27% glucan, 5.4% xylan, 1.2% arabinan, 5.7% mannan and 1.2% galactan. Dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment (at 121°C and 16.2 psi) was insufficient to solubilize cellulose and hemicellulose and did not remove much of the lignin. Cellulose-solvent and Organic Solvent-based Lignocellulose Fractionation (COSLIF) (at 50°C and atmospheric pressure) generated high glucose yield (70%). Substituting ethanol for acetone as organic solvent increased the yield to 89.5%. Fermentation using Zymomonas mobilis 8b with this hydrolysate confirmed the pretreatment is promising for the SSO conversion. Amenability of the SSO for biofuel production is validated. Enzymatic hydrolysis of both pretreatments using Accellerase 1500 is preferred over Celluclast 1.5L due to higher activity. Future work includes design of an appropriate batch and/or continuous bioreactor, and further understanding of Zymomonas mobilis 8b.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Since the late 1970s, bioethanol industry has been broadly expanded by worldwide recognition for environmental, economic, and renewable attributes. The emphasis of ethanol fuel promotion included not only energy security but also environmental benefits. Today, bioethanol is by far the largest and most immediately available alternative to petroleum and diesel, decreasing the adverse environmental effects and production dependency typical in fossil fuel consumption (Wyman, 2001; von Blottnitz & Curran, 2007). It is a renewable energy with the following benefits (Pembina Institute, 2001):  Emitting less toxic emissions into the air, land, and water  Protecting global climates  Having an unlimited feedstock supply  Creating job opportunities  Guaranteeing energy price stability due to the availability of resources  Helping to manage energy costs  Geopolitical stability

A glimpse at the current media reports on the past and today's status of bioethanol indicates industrial ushering in a new energy era. Numerous efforts corresponding to rapidly growing demand on bioethanol production have been made to produce ethanol from various feedstocks including: 1) major energy crops (food crops such as corn, wheat, rice, potato, and sugarcane; non food crops such as switchgrass, willow, and poplar), 2) forestry and agricultural waste leftovers (i.e., woodchips from tree stumps and foliage, wheat straw, rice hull, molasses, corn stover, corn cob), and 3) wasted crops defined as crop lost in distribution (Kim & Dale, 2004).
1

While the conflicting views on bioethanol feedstocks have raised food versus fuel argument, (Rosillo-Calle & Hall, 1987; Ziegler, 2007). This dilemma has been quickly embedding echo on scientific perspective, causing two major concerns including (Kim & Dale, 2004): 1) Biomass availability and critical need for proper substitution for energy crops and agricultural waste which have food value, trying to eradicate the competition between food and fuel 2) Fast and cost-effective bioethanol technology appropriate for conversion of biomass feedstock to fermentable sugars ­ focusing on pretreatment, a priority area

In a growing atmosphere of environmental stewardships and partnerships in Solid Waste Management (SWM) and 4R's (reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover resources) initiatives, wasteto- energy concept has given a new horizon to bioethanol feedstock supply by introducing lignocellulosic waste and Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW). It is a locally available, inexpensive energy resource and a major contribution to sustainable development (Zsigraiova et al, 2009). In addition, trash conversion into bioethanol helps to:  Streamline the problem with bioethanol feedstock and resolve the conflicts between human food and industrial use of crops,  Decrease waste piling up in landfills (landfill reduction),  Reduce greenhouse gas emission, such as methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).

One of the forms of the OFMSW is Source-Separated Organic (SSO) waste, a processed organic food waste with ATS thermal screw machine and blended with 10 to30% woodchips. The ATS thermal screw is a unit process with combination of shearing action and high pressure between

2

the plates of the screw causing a transformation of the SSO to very fibrous and more homogenous material. The SSO is subcategory of lignocellulosic waste feedstock (Vartek Ltd., 2005).

The heterogeneous and recalcitrant nature of the SSO is the major bottleneck and hampers the efficient release of locked polysaccharides from the SSO feedstock to fermentable sugars. Likewise, effective pretreatment of this kind of lignocellulosic waste governs related- operational systems in an ethanol biorefinery (major role of pretreatment is discussed in greater details in chapter 2). Pretreatment requires to be evaluated through enzymatic hydrolysis followed by fermentation.

Enzymatic hydrolysis depends on the function of cellulases and hemicellulases. This hydrolysis step, a saccharification process, represents one of the largest costs in converting lignocellulosic biomass to fuel ethanol. Currently, different types of commercial enzyme complexes are available in the market. It is believed that yield of fermentable sugars and production costs can be significantly reduced by applying enzymes which are improved by modern biotechnology and bioprocess engineering.

This research discusses pretreatment and saccharification of the SSO waste, through comparative study on two different acidic pretreatments including dilute sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) pretreatment and lignocellulosic fractionation by cellulose-solvent (phosphoric acid, H 3 PO 4 ) and organicsolvent, (acetone, OC(CH 3 ) 2 and/or ethanol, C 2 H 6 O). Then enzymatic hydrolysis behaviours on the basis of glucose and xylose yields are investigated to compare the performance of two commercial enzyme complexes. Evaluation is finalized by influence of pretreatment on fermentation process with selected strain of bacteria (characterization and experimental models
3

developed for dilute acid pretreatment and fractionation of SSO substrate are presented in chapter 3 followed by results and discussion in chapter 4).

This thesis is part of collaborative research project and corresponds to the last stage of phase 3, pretreatment and saccharification of SSO. Detailed history of the research projects, including phases, subtopics and stages, timeline, facilitators and partners are presented in appendix VI. The SSO waste has never been investigated as a substrate for ethanol production and that is the point differentiates this study from others. Scientific sources used in this study are available from literature including previous study reports on cellulosic ethanol production, scientific articles, papers, recently registered patent on this technology, industrial reports, handbooks (i.e., bioethanol production and utilization, biofuel technology, compost engineering), and analytical procedures presented by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory department of energy. (NREL) of the U.S.

1.2 Study Objectives
This study is intended to compare the efficiency of two acidic pretreatments at different conditions on processed SSO waste by ATS thermal screw on the basis of fermentable sugars for ethanol production with the following tasks:  To present a thorough literature review on ethanol biorefineries with emphasis on biomass feedstock and pretreatment technology,  To determine the compositional analysis of SSO sample for pretreatment design,  To carry out an experimental investigation on dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment,  To carry out an experimental investigation on cellulose solvent (phosphoric acid) and organic solvent (acetone and/or ethanol) based lignocellulose fractionation,
4

 To investigate enzymatic hydrolysis behavior after each acidic pretreatment on the basis of - fermentable sugar yield, - performance of two commercial enzyme complexes,  To evaluate the influence of pretreatment on fermentation process with selected strain of bacteria. It is foreseen that the results obtained in this study will improve the overall understanding about SSO characteristics and pretreatment, which correspond to the projected goal. It will also provide important information for the next step of further investigation on batch and continuous culture design.

2 Literature Review
2.1 Ethanol Biorefineries
Over the past two decades, bioethanol technology has been improved by means of an increasing engineering knowledge base, comprehension of new and varied feedstocks, and integrated energy balance data during all processes (Wyman, 2001). However, no single process design offers the most cost-effective way to produce ethanol from biomass. Important parameters involved with cost estimation data comprised of the type and cost of biomass as a raw material, the utilization process and energy demand, and also the capital cost of the plant. The design of the plant as well as its individual steps used in processes need to be based on an accurate and reliable data (Galbe et al., 2007; Rutz & Janssen, 2008).

Many hybrid techniques have been developed for ethanol biorefineries from different fields for example microbiology, bioengineering, and biomass engineering. Currently, there are two platforms (or bases) for ethanol biorefineries and Figure 2-1 presents a general view on these conversion technologies including (Fernando et al., 2006): 1) Thermochemical method, a gasification dominant technique with syngas platform: It is a unique technique using syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) derived from biomass and waste products (mostly lignocellulosic waste material) to produce bioethanol (Younesi et al., 2005). As shown in Figure 2-1, there are two main steps for creating syngas: i) pyrolysis of carbon-based waste products, and ii) gasification, (Rutz & Janssen, 2008; Wagner, 2007). On the basis of selecting a catalyst, there are two optional systems for syngas conversion to ethanol including chemical compound and microorganism such as Clostridium ljungdahlii capable of fermenting the synthesis gas to ethanol and acetate (Demirbas, 2005).

2) Fermentation, a biological dominant technique with sugar platform: Technically, the state of art fermentation system involves two major conversions that include feedstock to monomeric sugar, then sugars to alcohol through the following steps (Rutz & Janssen, 2008; ENERS Energy Concept, 2008; Zeikus, 1980) :
7

1. Feedstock supply which relies on harvesting, reception, storage. 2. Pretreatment, a crucial step which depends on type of the biomass, and includes physical, chemical and biological. 3. Microbial fermentation which is monomeric sugar conversion to ethanol. 4. Distillation which is separation of ethanol. In addition, where enzymatic hydrolysis, a biological pretreatment, is applied, different levels of process integration are possible, including (Hamelinck et al., 2005):  Separate (or Sequential) Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF),  Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF),  Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF), and  Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) system.

2.2 Bioethanol Feedstocks
Bioethanol feedstock supply sectors can be classified into woody biomass, agriculture, industry and waste as shown in Table 2-1(Sims, 2004; EUBIA, 2007). On the basis of natural composition of bioethanol feedstock, the above classification is categorized in three major groups: 1) starchy biomass (i.e. corn, rice, and tubers like cassava), 2) sugar-based biomass (i.e. sugar beet, and sugar cane); and 3) lignocellulosic material (i.e. wheat straw, rice hull, corn stover). Sugar and starch based feedstocks are often referred to as "first generation" of bioethanol feedstocks. Lignocellulosic feedstocks are known as "second generation" due to the recent advanced technologies which have provided the opportunity to use non edible feedstocks for producing bioethanol (Rutz & Janssen, 2008; ENERS Energy Concept, 2008).

Table 2-1 Classification of bioethanol feedstocks (Sims, 2004; EUBIA, 2007) Supply sector Type
Dedicated forestry Woody Biomass Forestry by-products Wood process residue Recovered wood fuels Dry lignocellulosic energy crops Energy crops Agriculture short rotation and annuals Agricultural residues Livestock waste Agro- industrial by-products Water vegetation Industry Industrial residue Dry lignocellulosic Waste Contaminated waste

Example
Short rotation plantations (e.g. willow, poplar, eucalyptus) Wood blocks, wood chips from thinnings, Bark, sawdust, shavings, wood chips and off-cuts Recovered wood fuels from activities such as land clearance & municipal green waste Herbaceous crops (e.g. miscanthus, reed canarygrass, giant reed) Oil seeds for methylesters (e.g. rape seed, sunflower) Sugar crops for ethanol (e.g. sugar cane, sweet sorghum) Starch crops for ethanol (e.g. maize, wheat) Straw, prunings from vineyards and fruit trees Wet and dry manure (cattle, pigs, horses and poultry as well as human ) Bagasse, rice husks Algae, water hyacinths, seaweeds Industrial waste wood, sawdust from sawmills Fibrous vegetable waste from paper industries Residues from parks and gardens (e.g. prunings, grass) Demolition wood Organic fraction of municipal solid waste Biodegradable landfill waste, landfill gas Sewage sludge

In practice, local considerations should be brought to attention. The choice of raw material and bioethanol technology depend on what grows best under the prevailing climate conditions, landscape and soil composition, as well as on the sugar content and ease of processing of the various plants available (EUBIA, 2008; BIOCAP Canada, 2008; Rutz & Janssen, 2008). For
9

example, the most bioethanol produced from sugar cane is in South America (Brazil), and corn in North America (USA). Table 2-2 presents locations of the most common bioethanol feedstocks (von Blottnitz & Curran, 2007).

Currently, lignocellulosic feedstock as the most abundant biomass has attracted considerable attention (Kuhad & Singh, 1993) and is often a major or the sole components of different waste streams from agriculture and forestry to municipalities' waste (Taherzadeh & Karimi, 2008). Lignocellulosic waste represents huge amounts of unutilized renewable resource and depending on its origin has been divided into three groups (Rutz & Janssen, 2008): 1. Primary waste, originated from harvesting of food crops (e.g., straw, corn stalks and leaves), and residues from forestry (e.g. wood thinning from commercial forestry). 2. Secondary waste, from beverage and food industry, (e.g., nut shells, sugar cane, bagasse, and saw dust). 3. Tertiary waste, a large variety of different waste fractions (e.g., OFMSW).
10

Waste of reusable materials is accumulated due to the throw-away philosophy and is causing major problems in Solid Waste Management (SWM) (Taherzadeh & Karimi, 2008). In this respect, the 4Rs strategy helps to curb the destruction of ecosystem, and reduce pollution. Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems are becoming more complex due to the move from landfill-based to resource recovery-based solutions rooted in the setting of international and national targets to divert waste from landfill and increase recycling and recovery rates (Woodruff et al., 2004).

2.3 Feedstock Selection
According to the lignocellulosic waste classification, Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the feasible sources for bioethanol feedstock. Generally, it includes three categories: 1) urban and residential, 2) industrial, commercial and institutional, and 3) demolition, landscaping and construction. The composition depends on what is thrown away and consists of several fractions which can be simplified into two main groups: i) Organic waste (e.g., food, paper, cardboard, plastics, textiles, rubber, leather, yard wastes, wood), and ii) inorganic waste (e.g., glass, tin cans, aluminum and other metals). Furthermore, the MSW is a function of several variables such as seasonal climate, geographical location, and the degree of recycling (Woodruff et al., 2004; BIOCAP Canada, 2008; Bradley, 2006).

In theory, anything that is organic can be used as a feedstock. However, different organic fractions respond differently to biological degradation when they are discharged into the environment or in a landfill (BIOCAP Canada, 2008). One of the forms of the OFMSW, a tertiary lignocellulosic waste mentioned in section 2.2, is SSO waste, a processed organic food waste with ATS thermal screw machine and blended with 10 to 30% woodchips.

11

The ATS thermal screw is a unit process with combination of shearing action and high pressure between the plates of the screw causing a transformation of the SSO to very fibrous and more homogenous material (Vartek Ltd., 2005) in such a way that the feedstock is exposed to crushing, mixing, homogenizing, granulating, cell decomposition, compacting, heat generation, and moisture reduction, all in one processing step. These functions are carried out by screws that transport the biomass or waste material from an intake hopper through several drying chambers (Jones et al., 1991).

Briefly, heat generates through friction caused by the forward pressure and turning action of the screws. The temperature rises inside the machine causing the moisture removal and heating of the feedstock which results in melting with some materials such as plastic. The normal operating temperature runs between 105 and 125°C with wet biomass. The wet waste material moves through the machine, continually blended and dried. It progressively loses moisture as it moves from one chamber to the next. The back pressure on the screws builds up to 290 bar (4500 psi) during briquetting (Jones et al., 1991).

The results of the ATS thermal screw process vary as the specific gravity and friction characteristics differ with loads of the waste material. General experience with municipal garbage, which is predominantly made of light materials, such as lignocellulosic matter, organics and plastics, is as follows (Jones et al., 1991):  Feedstock: mixed garbage (with 50-40% moisture) predominately including papers, plastics, foods, with miscellaneous solid objects such as cans, rocks etc.  Garbage moisture: on average 30%  Driving power: 150 kilowatt (kW)

12

 Discharge output: briquetting 900 kg/hr, granulating (average) 1800 kg/hr  Screw speed: 81 rpm  Finished product: dense briquette or flaked material with an average moisture content of 15% (moisture content depends on defined condition for final product)  Volume reduction: average 7:1 ( this range can be as high as 10:1)

Typically, SSO waste is a recalcitrant and heterogeneous substrate. Type of the woodchips, which can be any kind of woody or agricultural waste (as presented in Table 2-1 on page 9) alters the compositional analysis of SSO. Furthermore, the composition may vary depending on several local factors: 1) sorting criteria specified by the municipality for use by the households; 2) efficiency of the citizens in sorting properly; 3) collection system including the types of collection bags used in the kitchen (paper, plastic) and local storage bins (containers, paper sacks), and finally 4) pretreatment (disc screen, screw separator, magnetic separator, etc.) prior to the biological treatment (la Cour Jansen et al., 2004). SSO components (excluding plastic, rubber and leather particles and pieces) are as follows (Tchobanoglous et al.,1993): 1. Water-soluble constituent (e.g., sugars, starches, amino acids, and various organic acids) 2. Lignocellulose including:  Cellulose: a condensation product of six carbon sugar glucose, such as paper, wood, and yard waste (it is about 60% of the dry weight of a typical MSW stream)  Hemicellulose: a condensation product of five and six carbon sugars  Lignin: a polymeric material containing rings with methoxyl groups (-OCH 3 ), the exact chemical nature of which is still not known (present in some paper products such as newsprint, and fiberboard)

2.4 Benefits of SSO Waste Feedstock
Waste-to-energy strategies and facilities are part of the solution of the worldwide solid waste disposal problem (Woodruff et al., 2004). Hence, diverting organic fraction of MSW to ethanol would provide a unique solution not only to growing dilemmas over MSW disposal, but also food versus fuel argument. It also contributes, albeit marginally, toward diversifying energy sources (Wyman, 1999; Kalogo et al., 2007). Moreover, producing ethanol from MSW can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and dependency on non-renewable petroleum (Kalogo et al., 2007).

Kalogo et al., (2007), presented that MSW-to-bioethanol performs better than corn-ethanol and gasoline because the net life cycle energy used in producing ethanol from MSW is less than the energy used for producing corn-ethanol. In addition, the MSW-to-bioethanol reduces net GHG emissions by 65% compared to gasoline, and by 58% when compared to corn-ethanol. Furthermore, converting MSW into ethanol instead of landfilling will result in significant fossil energy savings. In 2005, the bioethanol that could potentially be produced from MSW was estimated to be 7.7 to 13.7 billion L. While in the same year, 530 billion L of motor gasoline was consumed in the United States. This indicates that MSW-to-ethanol is likely to perform a relatively minor role in fuel market. However, it can augment the diversity of the domestic energy resource base (Kalogo et al., 2007).

14

Conclusively, SSO waste conversion to bioethanol is a safe solution to battle the deteriorating impact of fossil fuel consumption and waste pile-up in landfills. SSO waste is a promising substrate for bioethanol industry with significant benefits such as:
 Avoiding depletion of farm lands that should be growing food or supporting food-based

production instead of feeding an energy crop-based ethanol plant  Inexpensive  Reducing generated waste  Lessening the inherent problem with landfills (potential threat to human health as well as a threat to our environment: e.g. smell; rapidly filling up and taking space; tendency to pollute leachate which can end up in groundwater; GHG emissions including methane sulfur, and carbon dioxide)  Good alternative fuel in terms of GHG emissions

2.5 Pretreatment Technology
Pretreatment is a technical procedure to convert lignocellulosic biomass into a form that enzymatic hydrolysis is effective. It is a critical unit affecting the design and economic viability in bioethanol refineries (Figure 2-1, page7). So far, recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass is the main challenge in the pretreatment process (da Costa Sousa et al., 2009).

Lignocelluloses feedstock consists of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. Cellulose is a long chain of glucose monomers linked to one another by -1, 4 glycosidic bonds. It is highly

crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis and biological digestion. Also, hydrogen bonds between different layers of these polysaccharides, matrix of glucose chains, contribute to the resistance of crystalline cellulose towards degradation. Hemicellulose consists of six-carbon (hexoses, e.g., glucose) and five-carbon sugars (pentoses, e.g., mannose, xylose, arabinose, galactose) with D15

xylose as its major component. The degree of branching and identity of the sugars in hemicelluloses tends to vary depending on the type of plant. Lignin contains no sugars and is covalently linked to hemicelluloses via ferulic acid ester linkages. It encloses the cellulose and hemicellulose molecules (Gray et al., 2006).

Lignin is hardly biodegradable and composed of three major phenolic components, with extensive cross-linking, including p-coumaryl alcohol (H), coniferyl alcohol (G) and sinapyl alcohol (S) (Lee et al., 2007; Rubin, 2008). A general detail of the lignocellulose structure, based on above description, is presented in Figure 2-2(Wyman & Yang, 2009; Rubin, 2008; Himmel, et al., 2007).

Lignocellulosic feedstock composition differs among lignocellulosic substances. For instance, corn stover contains 41% cellulose, 21% hemicelluloses, and about 17% lignin (Gong et al, 1999). Kumar et al. (2009), and Sun and Cheng (2002), had an extensive reviews on efficient pretreatment methods based on compositional analysis of lignocellulosic material. Indeed, understanding the complexity involved with the nature of lignocellulosic substrate helps to design effective pretreatment. Composition of the major lignocelluloses is presented in Table 2-3 (Kumar et al., 2009; Sun & Cheng, 2002).

The inherent properties of lignocellulosic biomass (i.e. lignin shealth, crystallinity of cellulose, and particle size) can limit the digestibility of the hemicelluloses and cellulose. A variety of
17

technologies encompass a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological pretreatments that have been developed to release polysaccharides trapped in the complex structure of lignocellulose (da Costa Sousa et al., 2009). These are categorized below (Kumar et al., 2009; Taherzadeh & Karimi, 2008; Hsu, 1996):  Physical treatment: comminution (i.e. ball milling), irradiation (i.e. microwave heating), steaming/steam explosion, hydrothermolysis (i.e. high temperature coking in water),  Chemical treatment: hydrolysis with dilute acid (DA) (i.e. dilute sulfuric acid, dilute nitric acid), alkalin (using sodium hydroxide alone or with other chemicals such as peroxide), organic solvent, ammonia, sulfur dioxide-catalyzed steam explosion, carbon dioxide-steaming explosion,  Biological treatment: enzymatic hydrolysis (i.e. functional enzymes, lignin-solubilizing microorganisms to render cellulosic materials amenable to enzyme digestion).

Lignocellulosic pretreatment is described in many reports including Chang and Holtzapple (2000), Sierra et al. (2008), Hamelinck et al. (2005), Hendriks and Zeeman (2009), and Taherzadeh and Karimi (2008), with a detailed view on different lignocellulosic biomass. All of the above papers are considered the forefront of the field and highly co-cited (Thomson Reuters, 2009). Pretreatment of lignocellulosic substrate is meant to:  Disrupt the structural bonds: break the lignin shealth, separate hemicelluloses from cellulose  Alter crystallinity of cellulose  Alter the degree of polymerization(DP) 1 of cellulose and hemicellulose

 Expand the structure to increase pore size and accessible surface area (of cellulose and hemicelluloses) for enzymatic pretreatment (i.e. cellulases, and hemicellulases)  Produce fermentable sugars: hexoses and pentoses

The steps mentioned above are presented in Figure 2-3, through a cross-section view of the lignocelluloses structure (Mosier et al., 2005) in association with pretreatment function (physical, chemical and enzymatic stages) and final products (Baugh & McCarty, 1988). Pretreatment technology is considered the most costly process in a bioethanol technology system. A successful pretreatment should have the following qualities (Galbe & Zacchi, 2007):  High recovery of all carbohydrates  High digestibility of the cellulose in the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis  Low sugar degradation products, which inhibits fermentation  low energy demand, and low cost efficiency

Assessment of the pretreatment efficiency is usually based on the following factors (Galbe & Zacchi, 2007):  Sugar content liberated during pretreatment to the liquid, measured as a combination of monomers and oligomers as well as water-insoluble solid  Enzymatic hydrolysis of slurry substrate originated from chemical pretreatment  Fermentation of the pretreated substrate to assess inhibitors on the basis of two model: i. ii. liquid fraction of pretreated slurry (Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation SHF) whole slurry via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation

Typical pretreatment categories with examples are summarized (Table 2-4), which is based on comprehensive studies published by Hamelinck et al. (2005); Hendriks and Zeeman (2009); Sierra et al. (2008); Taherzadeh and Karimi (2008). Deployed pretreatments in this sourcesare mainly dilute acid, ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX), and lime for evaluating different aspects including sugar recovery and design values (Wyman et al., 2005b). So far, the AFEX and the DA hydrolysis are the most common pretreatment (Hamelinck et al., 2005). Teymouri et al. (2005) emphasized the AFEX treatment based on its unique features that differentiates from other biomass treatments. Some of these distinctive features are:  Nearly all of the ammonia can be recovered and reused while the remaining serves as nitrogen source for microbes in downstream processes.  There is no wash stream in the process. Dry matter recovery following the AFEX treatment is nearly 100%. Treated biomass can be stable for long periods and can be fed at very high solid loadings in enzymatic hydrolysis or fermentation process.  Cellulose and hemicellulose are well preserved in the AFEX process, with little or no degradation.  Compared to the DA hydrolysis, the AFEX-treated biomass prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis does not require neutralization  Enzymatic hydrolysis of AFEX treated biomass produces clean sugar streams for subsequent fermentation process.

This is the efficiency of the downstream enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose, usually in 24 h Difference between `steam' pretreatment and `steam explosion' pretreatment is the quick depressurization and cooling down of the biomass at the end of the steam explosion pretreatment, which causes the water in the biomass to `explode'. NA: information is not available

22

In the DA pretreatment, neutralization is necessary prior to enzymatic hydrolysis and the cost of the DA pretreatment is usually higher than AFEX method (Sun & Cheng, 2002). However, the DA pretreatment is the most common method for industrial application (Taherzadeh & Karimi, 2008). 2.5.1 Dilute acid pretreatment

Dilute acid pretreatment is a function of five parameters including acid concentration (0.5-4% depending on the type of acid) (Galbe & Zacchi, 2002), temperature (121­240°C) (Saha & Bothast, 1999; Galbe & Zacchi, 2002), residence or reaction time (2­90 min) (Saha & Bothast, 1999), pressure (3-15 atmospheres), and solid loading (10-40%) (Wyman et al., 2005a). Specific setting of these parameters in each pretreatment depends on the type of lignocellulosic biomass.

The common problem with acid pretreatment is formation of inhibitory compounds, mostly at high temperature, which has a negative impact on microbial activity during the fermentation process. During the pretreatment, pentose monomers can further degrade to furfural, and hexoses to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), followed by formation of the levulinic and humic acid. This reduces available sugar for conversion to bioethanol. Moreover, during pretreatment acetic acid is released from acetyl groups in hemicellulose, as a consequence of deacetylation of acetylated pentosans (Ballesteros et al., 2007). Conditioning (overliming) process reduces the toxicity of hydrolysates generated from pretreatment by adding lime to adjust pH to the range 9-11, to precipitate gypsum (known as calcium sulfate), followed by filtration, and then neutralizing or re-acidifying to a value appropriate for fermentation (Mohagheghi et al., 2006).

23

Consequently, one of the main purposes of DA pretreatment at low temperature (mostly autoclave conditions) is to minimize formation of inhibitory compounds (Saha & Bothast, 1999). A broad range of lignocellulosic substrates have been examined and pretreated by dilute sulfuric acid (DSA), with different concentration from 0.3 to 2 % (w/w) over a temperature range from 120 to 150 ° C and residence time ranging from 15 to 90 minutes in an effort to optimize the pretreatment process for sugar production. Here are some examples of conducted experiments:


Soft wood treated by 0.35% (w/w) DSA at 60° C for 6 hours, followed by steam explosion of the slurry (Schell et al., 1998)

 Alfalfa, reed canary grass, switchgrass with 0 to 2.5 % (w/v) DSA, autoclaved at 121 °C

for 1 hour (Dien, et al., 2006)  Coastal bermudagrass with 0.3 to 1.2 % (w/w) at temperatures from 120 to 180°C over residence times of 5 to 60 minutes (Redding et al., 2008)


Wheat straw by 0.75 % (v/v) DSA, autoclaved at 121 °C for 1 hour (Saha et al., 2005)

A new method with broad substrate applicability was established by Zhang P. et al. (2007). It is based on phosphoric acid dissolution and organic solvent, operating 50°C and atmospheric pressure. This method effectively transformed the crystalline cellulose to amorphous cellulose, and had efficient organic solvent recycling. Description of this designed pretreatment is presented in the next section. 2.5.2 Cellulose-Solvent and Organic Solvent-Based Lignocellulose Fractionation

Early reports used phosphoric acid (85%) as a cellulose swelling and/or dissolution agent to reduce the DP and increase reactivity of cellulose by cellulase enzymes (Pandey et al, 2009). Later, swelling of crystalline cellulose of cotton fibre, in phosphoric acid, was investigated
24

(Pandey & Nair, 1974). Gradually, cellulose swelling in phosphoric acid was developed for cellulase activity assays on cellulose substrate (Sharrock, 1988). The cellulose swelling process differs from dissolution as the former retains the solid cellulose as a moiety of particles fibre, while the latter transforms the slurry into a single phase. The operation conditions determine the dominant process. Since then, phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) has become the most effective substrate in enzymatic hydrolysis process (Zhang et al., 2006).

Later, Cellulose solvent and Organic Solvent-based Lignocellulose Fractionation (COSLIF), a modified process based on PASC, was introduced by Zhang P., (2007). It is one of the newly developed bioethanol technologies, which was later elaborated in this study. The details of its unit processes are shown in Figure 2-4 and the mechanism involved in each unit operation is described below (Zhang, P., et al., 2007): Operation 1: Concentrated H 3 PO 4 is used to treat (wet) lignocellulose at 50°C for 30 to 60 min (based on optimized condition). Phosphoric acid performs the following:  disrupts the lignin-carbohydrate complex bonds;  dissolves cellulose fibrils and hemicellulose by breaking up orderly hydrogen bonds among sugar chains;  weakly hydrolyzes cellulose and hemicellulose to a low DP fragments;  removes acetyl groups from hemicellulose to form acetic acid. Operation 2: Acetone is added to precipitate the dissolved cellulose and hemicellulose and to dissolve partial lignin in the liquid phase; Operation 3: Acetone is used to wash out 99.5% of phosphoric acid from the precipitated solids and to remove the dissolved lignin;

25

Operation 4: Water is used to remove acetone from the solids and water­soluble hemicellulose from the solid cellulose; Operation 5: Enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis is carried out at 50°C; Operation 6: Black liquor is separated into phosphoric acid, acetone, acetone-soluble lignin, and acetic acid from hemicellulose. Highly volatile acetone and modestly volatile acetic acid can be easily separated by distillation, and the precipitated lignin can be separated by solid/liquid separator at the bottom of the column;

Figure 2-4 General scheme of COSLIF unit process (Zhang et al., 2007)

26

Operation 7: Light liquor is separated into acetone, a small amount of phosphoric acid, and water-soluble hemicellulose. Acetone can be recovered by flashing. The precipitated Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 , after the reaction with CaCO 3 , can be used to regenerate concentrated phosphoric acid adding using the wet phosphoric acid production method; water soluble hemicellulose remains in the liquid phase.

In all, this technology can fractionate lignocellulose into amorphous cellulose (mainly glucose after hydrolysis), lignin, hemicellulose, and acetic acid at modest reaction conditions (50°C and atmospheric pressure) with easy recycling of acetone and phosphoric acid. The COSLIF pretreatment is a promising option with high sugar yield and considerable technical benefits including (Zhang, P., et al., 2007):  no sugar degradation,  no inhibitor formation, and consequently no need for detoxification,  no need for special reactor, (while dilute acid and AFEX pretreatments need special reactor),  fast enzymatic hydrolysis rate,  modest reaction conditions (50°C and atmospheric pressure). 2.5.3 Enzymatic Pretreatment

Enzymatic pretreatment is a bioconversion process in which biocatalysts facilitate the conversion of physio-chemically pretreated substrate to fermentable sugars. Enzymatic pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass relies on two enzyme complexes including cellulases and hemicellulases, and has numerous applications and biotechnological potential for various industries (i.e. chemicals, fuel, food, brewery and wine, animal feed, textile and laundry, pulp, paper and

27

agriculture). Hemicellulases and most cellulases are multi-domain proteins 2 (Howard et al., 2003).

In a natural fermentation process, potent cellulolytic organism such as Trichoderma reesei produces complex mixtures of enzymes composed of three major groups including endogluconases often called carboxymethylcellulase (CM-cellulases), exoglucanases or cellobiohydrolases, and ß-glucosidases or cellobiases. Digestibility of celluloses according to its structure occurs as below (Szakacs et al., 2006):  Endoglucanases cleave the internal ß­1, 4­glycosidic bonds of amorphous, swollen cellulose and release glucose, cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharides.  The exoglucanases cleave cellobiose units from the ends of the polysaccharide chains.  ß­glucosidases cleave cellobiose, to release glucose. There are 13 major hemicellulases including Exo­-1,4­xylosidas, Endo­-1,4 xylanase, Endo­ ­1,4­mannanase, Exo­­1,4­mannosidase, ­L-arabinofuranosidase, Endo­­1,5-arabinanase, ­Glucuronidase, ­Galatosidase, Endo-galactanase, ­Glucosidase, Acetyl xylan esterases, Acetyl mannan esterase, Ferulic and p-cumaric acid esterases (Howard et al., 2003). Xylan is the major structure of hemicelluloses and is bonded to lignin. The depolymerisation of xylan by xylanases results in xylooligosaccharides and xyloses. The complex structure of xylan needs different enzymes for complete hydrolysis. Hemicellulose degradation is summarized as follows:  Endo­1,4­ß ­xylanases which depolymerise xylan  ­L­arabinofuranosidase, ­D­glucuronidase, galactosidase, and acetyl xylan esterase liberate the side groups in xylan

2

consisting of two or more domains belonging to different classes of protein

28

Potent producers of xylanases are cellulolytic fungi such as Aspergillus niger (Perma, 2006). (Perma, 2006)

This shows that efficient degradation of lignocellulosic feedstock requires a mixture of different enzymes acting sequentially or in concert. Recent discussion on multifunctional glucanases including some cellulases and hemicellulases, demonstrates the concept of "one enzyme one activity" might not hold in all cases, especially with glucanases (Ghose, 1987) which is a multifunctional protein consisting of a single type of polypeptide 3 chain, with multiple catalytic or binding activities (Howard et al., 2003).

The enzymatic process highly depends on various operating variables including type and quantity of enzymes, pH, enzyme loading, solid loading of a slurry substrate, hydrolysis time, enzyme mechanism and feedback inhibition (such as sugar concentration), and extent of digestibility of substrate (da Costa Sousa et al., 2009). Recently, a great deal of effort has been devoted to develop efficient and cost effective enzymatic hydrolysis. There is a wide range of commercial enzyme complexes available in the market. Significant advances have been made towards engineering a new generation of cellulase cocktails that would further reduce enzyme cost by enhancing the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and reducing the amount of enzyme required (Li, X.,et al., 2009).

In 2008, the U.S Department of Energy announced its goal to develop commercially viable biofuel focusing on new generation of enzymes with low protein content and high activity to decreasing the dosage of enzyme required to hydrolyze biomass. $33.8 million was invested among following producers (Ruggiero, 2008):

In 2009, two enzyme manufacturers, Genencore and Novozymes, rolled out the new generation of cellulosic ethanol enzymes (Retka Schill, 2009). For example, Accellerase 1500 is Genencor's new generation of enzyme product, a significant step toward more cost-effective, commercialscale production developed for second generation of biorefineries 4. It contains multiple enzyme activities, mainly exoglucanases, endoglucanases, ­glucosidase, with hemicellulase side activity. The synergistic effect of the enzyme activities lead to hydrolyzing the complex lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable monosaccharides as well as aid materials handling through liquefaction and viscosity reduction. It has been shown to successfully hydrolyze a wide range of lignocellulosic feedstocks. In contrast to conventional celluclases such as Celluclast 1.5L, (product of Novozymes 5), Accellerase 1500 has the following benefits (Genencor, 2007):  Enhanced saccharification performance on a variety of feedstocks,  Ability to operate in SSF, and SHF processes,  Higher ­glucosidase activity to minimize residual cellobiose, which can lead to higher rates of saccharification and ultimately to faster ethanol fermentation.

According to the above, performance of Accellerase 1500 and Celluclast 1.5L was compared in this study. 2.5.4 Ethanol-Producing Organisms

An ideal ethanologenic organism (ethanol biocatalyst) should be capable of fermenting all biomass sugars to ethanol. Required characteristics have been investigated and cited through many studies and prominent qualities are summarized in Table 2-5 (Dien et al., 2003; Zaldivar et al., 2001 ). Table 2-5 Classified characteristics of ethanol biocatalyst (Zaldivar et al., 2001; Dien et al.,
2003)

Requirements >90% of theoretical >40gl-1 >1gl-1 h-1 Inexpensive medium formulation Resistance to inhibitors Acidic pH or higher temperatures

Many reports and reviews have been published on production of ethanol fermentation by microorganisms. The most common ethanol-producing organisms are summarized in Table 2-6 (Ward and Singh in 2002; Dien et al., 2003; Lin and Tanaka, 2006; Leschine & Warnick, 2007). Depending on their biological family, fermentation quality can be optimized by manipulating

31

operating pH and temperature. As shown, many of these species have been genetically modified for fermenting both pentose and hexose.

A wide-ranging mix of hexoses and pentoses can be released from the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. Most cellulolytic bacterial strains prefer to utilize glucose as a substrate and are incapable of fermenting other sugars such as pentoses. This is a major technical roadblock to the development of bioethanol industry. Researchers are pursuing potential solutions to this problem by investigating recombinant DNA techniques to genetically modify strains in order to maximize the cellulosic ethanol yield, increase the microbe's tolerance to ethanol, eliminate unwanted byproducts, and expand their substrate selection (towards metabolism of pentose sugars) (He et al., 2009).

Up until now, great advances have been made in genetically modifying strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a kind of yeast) and bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Zymomonas mobilis, and thus these strains are industrially favorable (He et al., 2009). A potentially powerful strategy is to use Consolidate Bioprocessing (CBP) system, which features cellulase production, lignocellulose hydrolysis, and fermentation in one step. This bypasses the pretreatment steps and lowers the overall processing cost. For example various cellulolytic clostridia investigated for CBP system such as Clastridiume thermocellum, a thermophilic bacteria (Lynd et al., 2005), and Clastridum phytofermentans (Leschine, 2007)

There are limited studies on conversion of food waste to bioethanol. The most prominent peer­ reviewed studies are summarized in Table 3-1. As shown, laboratory made and/or selected carbohydrate-rich food wastes with diverse characteristics have been subjected to different pretreatment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the common microorganism used for fermentation process. The yield of fermentable sugar and/or ethanol production varies as the authors focused on influential factors such as kinetic model (Davis, 2008), and statistical optimization of glucose yield through response surface methodology (Kim, J., et al., 2008). Evidently, conversion process scenario relies on function of multi- step pretreatment and multi-enzyme complex.

The preliminary studies on SSO conversion to ethanol have portrayed a promising future. Despite the holocellulose and starch content as major sources of sugars, complexity on its composition is still an obstacle in biomass hydrolysis, which is a rate-limiting step in conversion process. Laboratory investigation on SSO-ethanol is still in the empirical stages and requires far more studies in terms of characterization and pretreatment (Moon et al., 2009).

Following the objectives of this research, experimental plan was developed based on available pretreatment methods (Table 2-5), and similar studies on organic food waste (Table 3-1). In this chapter, experimental design of each acid pretreatment is discussed. The main goal is to investigate glucose and xylose yield at moderate pretreatment condition followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. The complexity involved in the nature of SSO substrate and experimental specifications are fundamental elements, which differentiate this analysis from others. All experimental data are presented and discussed in Chapter 4.

3.2 Experimental Investigation Plan
Pre-treatment technique is a central unit process in bioethanol technology (da Costa Sousa et al, 2009) due to the cross effects amongst four steps: biomass structural features, chemical pretreatment, enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis, and fermentation (Zhu et al., 2008).

One aspect of this study is to carry out a series of experiments based on two forms of acidic treatment: 1) Dilute Acid (DA) pretreatment with sulfuric acid; and 2) cellulose solvent and organic solvent-based lignocellulose fractionation (COSLIF). The main goal is to compare their intensity and overall efficiency on total fermentable sugar yields of subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Each method is evaluated in the context of the entire unit, namely acid pretreatment, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and finally fermentation, as shown in Figure 3-1. Enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation are pH dependant processes and range of pH, presented in Figure 31, is based on their optimal conditions.

3.3 Substrate Characterization
Compositional analysis of SSO is the research gateway to identify elemental composition of this type of substrate. Generally, SSO biomass is a chemically complex mixture and a fundamental feature for microbial growth. Understanding the fundamental composition associated with energy content, and natural variability are essential for scientists and engineers to conduct and develop a research on bioethanol technology (McDermitt & Loomis, 1981). Hence, for a reasonable use of any SSO bioresource feedstock, it is justifiable to determine technical parameters and unlock the leading factors for estimation on overall efficiency, and desirable product yield in a defined process. In this respect, a well-organized quantitative and qualitative analysis is essential to support and enable a technical design.

Analytical measurements routinely referenced in biomass industry are: 1) standard procedures of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - a division of US Department of Energy (DOE); 2) Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI); and 3) American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The NREL procedures are the most valid and common used references (NREL, 2008). They were also applied in this study. General scheme of experimental methods and references are presented in the Figure 3-5. Among indicated parameters, it was necessary to highlight specific items, including homogenization as a core centre of chemical analysis, biodegradability because of lignin content, and extractives due to interference of inorganic material as well as non-structural compounds in downstream analysis of the SSO. Furthermore, laboratory procedures for determination of extractives and acid soluble lignin were modified in accordance with available facilities and defined experimental conditions.

Both SSO composition and its analysis methods are highly debatable. Selected compositional analysis methods have been studied in the master thesis of Mirzajani (2009). The main parameters of the current plan are further elaborated in Table 3-2 (NREL, 2008; CCME, 2005; Celesceri et al., 1989; Zhang, R., et al., 2007). All indicated procedures were determined according to referenced procedures in Figure 3-5. Protein content, nutrient value, trace elements, and salts analyses were not measured in this study.

Homogenization

In this study, SSO sample, contained 20% woodchips, was already pretreated by the ATS thermal screw machine. The woodchips are typically wood wastes primarily Douglas fir originated from home construction furniture, flooring, cabinet, and doors. Further, samples were also oven-dried at 45° C for 48 hours in laboratory (NREL/TP-510-42620, method B), prior to homogenization. All sharp foreign matter such as metal needles, plastic and rubber wastes, and broken glasses were collected, as much as it was possible. The dried SSO biomass was sent to MBI International, a subsidiary of the Michigan State University Foundation, for grinding and determination of polymeric sugar content. Figure 3-6 presents a summary of the sample preparation. Oven-dried SSO

3.3.2

Biodegradability

Dry organic substrate consists of volatile solid and ash. Only the biodegradable fraction of volatile solid has the potential for bioconversion. The non-biodegradable fraction is mostly lignin, which hinders biodegradation (Kayhanian et al, 2007). The following equation was developed by Chandler et al, (1980), to provide the best estimation for substrate biodegradability (Haug, 1993; Kayhanian et al., 2007): B = 0.83 ­ (0.028) X where, B = biodegradable fraction of the volatile solids (VS), and X = lignin content of the VS expressed as a percent of dry weight. The equation suggests that a substrate containing no lignin would only have a maximum degradability of 83%. This is reasonable since the decomposition of the organic waste is coupled with bacterial by-products which are not readily degradable (Haug, 1993). Kayhanian et al., (2007) had a comprehensive review on biodegradability of organic wastes and their estimation on biodegradable fraction of organic waste components in MSW is presented in Table 3-3.

3.3.3

Determination of Extractives

Both laboratory references for determination of extractives, NREL/TP-510-42619 and ASTM (E1690­08) are reasonably similar in structure. Nevertheless, the procedure was modified by boiling sample in solvent for 3 hours. The soxhlet extraction apparatus associated with constant heating and reflux time (maximum24 hours) was replaced by direct boiling (using hot plate) for 3 hours (Mirzajani, 2009). The ASTM (E1690-08) procedure was also modified by three times solvent exchanges with the following considerations:  7 g of oven-dried and moisture free SSO was added to the extraction thimble as suggested in ASTM (E1690­08) with 1 cm of free space in the top of the thimble, and then the thimble was sealed with cotton string.  Prepared thimble was placed in 500 Erlenmeyer flask filled with 150 ml ethanol 75% (V/V).  Solvent was exchanged every hour (three times in total). DDW was used for second and third solvent exchange.  All liquids were filtered, transferred to aluminum dish to evaporate to near dryness.  Evaporated samples placed in an oven with temperature adjusted at 103-105°C for 20 minutes. Figure 3-5 shows results after drying in the oven.  Total extractives (in water and ethanol) were determined through following calculation: % Extractives = [(W 1 -W 2 )/W 1 ] ×100, where: W 1 =Initial weight of SSO and W 2 = Weight of dry residue.

The final residue resulted from this experiment is shown in Figure 3-7.

3.4 Dilute Sulfuric Acid (DSA) Pretreatment
The DSA pretreatment at relatively low temperature to minimize the formation of inhibitory compounds, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, may be a workable process for generating fermentable sugars from SSO substrate. Table 3-4 presents a summary of the most common low temperature-DSA pretreatment design condition on three different substrates carried out in the last decade, thereby guiding to map out a model for the SSO pretreatment with DSA.

In the same way, similar framework was deployed in this research and details of the experimentation plan are presented in Table 3-5. Sulfuric acid at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% (w/w) was used for chemical pretreatment of the oven-dried SSO samples prepared in 125ml Wheaton glass serum bottle with 15% (w/w) solid loading. The mixtures were autoclaved at 121 °C and 16.2 psi for 15, 30 and 60 minutes.

3.5 COSLIF Process
Concentrated phosphoric acid has proven to be ideal cellulose solvent (Zhang et al., 2006), mainly for the following reasons (Zhang, P., et al., 2007):  Cellulose dissolution occurs at low temperature,  Regenerated cellulose remains in an amorphous form suitable for hydrolysis with high reactivity with cellulase enzymes, and finally  Residual phosphorous acid has no inhibitory effects on the sequential hydrolysis and fermentation.

Effective performance of COSLIF pretreatment relies on: 1) phosphoric acid concentration to act as a cellulose solvent; 2) sufficient reaction to dissolve biomass but short enough to prevent complete hydrolysis, and 3) reaction temperature below 60°C (Zhu et al., 2009).

Zhang P. et al. (2007), reported that this treatment technology is applicable to a broad range of substrates except for treating softwood Douglas fir. Nevertheless, digestibility of 75% was achieved using this treatment, compared to only 44% digestibility using SO 2 steam explosion as pretreatment. Following Zhang P. et al. (2007), results of recent attempt on COSLIF pretreatment of bermudagrass, reed, and rapeseed followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, validated the performance and high yield of phosphoric acid plus acetone pretreatment in high bioethanol production (Li H. et al., 2009). Since 2007, there have been several comparative studies on optimization of COSLIF pretreatment on different substrates. Some well-known studies in this field were used as guidance for Set Two of experimentations, which presented in the experimental investigation plan (Figure 3-2). These studies are summarized in Table 3-6.

In view of presented techniques, experiment Set Two was conducted with the following considerations: 1. Pre-assessment on COSLIF performance on SSO Substrate using same procedure described by Zhang P.et al. (2007). 2. Assessment on proper reaction time, among 1, 2, and 3 hours - on the basis of optimized condition presented in Table 3-6, considering similarities among compositional analysis of flax shives (Kim & Mazza, 2008) and corn stover (Zhu et al, 2009) (Moxley et al, 2008). 3. Assessment on modified COSLIF pretreatment followed by fermentation: Ethanol 95% (v/v) was used instead of acetone in the last two wash and centrifugations with organic solvent for phosphoric acid removal, due to the advantages highlighted by Sathitsuksanoh et al. (2009): i. Non-toxic to ethanol-producing bacteria, ii. more stable and less corrosive than acetone,

48

iii. acceptable recycling efficiency compared to acetone regarding remaining fraction of organic solvent in the hydrolysate and amorphous cellulose phase, iv. decrease in consumption of organic solvent.

Figure 3-9 exhibits the general scheme of Set Two experiments (Zhang P. et al., 2007). It is divided into three major steps including cellulose dissolution, washing and centrifugation, and finally enzymatic hydrolysis. The modification made to the cellulose dissolution step is as follows:  A 50 ml disposable plastic centrifuge tube was substituted by a 250 ml centrifuge bottle,  In the cellulose dissolution step, the water bath at 90 rpm was replaced by incubator (Thermo-Lab-Line-Barnstead MAX Q MINI 4450-Benchtop shaker) operating at an agitation rate of 150 rpm,  Centrifugation was carried out by Sorvall RC-5C PLUS super speed floor model, adjusted at 7000 rpm, at 24°C for 10 minutes.

3.6 Enzymatic Hydrolysis
Enzymatic process is an important bridge with central role between acidic pretreatment and fermentation, as shown in Figure 3-1 on page 36. The pH adjustment is needed 1) before enzymatic hydrolysis due to the pH of enzymes reactivity, optimum range at pH 4.8-5, and 2) after enzymatic hydrolysis, optimum range at pH 5.8-6, which relies on proper pH value for microbial activity in fermentation. The heterogeneous nature of SSO and the multiplicity of enzymes make it difficult to fully understand the interactions of enzymes and substrates. In order to eliminate any complexity involved with the experimental investigation, constant condition of enzymatic digestibility was maintained in both sets of acid pretreatment.

Characteristics of the three commercial enzyme mixtures used in this research are summarized in Table 3-7 (details of measured parameters in appendix II). Celluclast 1.5 L and Novozyme 188 were purchased Sigma Aldrich, and Accellerase 1500 was kindly provided by the Genencore Inc, a Danisco Division, Rochester, NY, USA. Unlike Celluclast 1.5L, Accellerase 1500 has higher activity with lower protein content and does not require ß-glucosidase supplementation to enable more complete degradation of cellobiose.

All prepared hydrolysates were diluted to the defined concentration of solid residue or glucose content as below with pH adjusted at (4.8-5): 10% (w/w) Solid loading for hydrolysate obtained from DA pretreatment 10 and 20 (g / L) glucose for amorphous cellulosic pellets after washing and centrifugation in COSLIF process The dilutor includes DDW, the essential amount of ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 OH) mainly for pH adjustment and as a source of nitrogen, the volume of sterile enzyme complex, and finally 1% (w/w) of sodium azide (NaN 3 ) solution (2%) in order to avoid microbial contamination. Despite autoclaving DA samples, the risk of cross-contamination still exists. It may occur through pH adjustment and/or dilution. The growth of organisms can be prevented by adding sodium azide. As shown in Figure 3-10, prepared samples for enzymatic hydrolysis experiments in both treatment methods were incubated in Thermo-Lab-Line-Barnstead MAX Q MINI 4450-Benchtop shaker. The incubator was adjusted at 250 rpm, sufficient to keep solids in constant suspension, and with temperature at 50 ± 0.2°C, for a period of 72hours. Figure 3-10 presents prepared sample for enzymatic hydrolysis including the DA samples with enzymes content, and the COSLIF pretreated samples.

3.7 Fermentation with Bacterial Strain of Interest
The primary focus of this study on acid pretreatment has been the evaluation of glucose and xylose yield and not necessarily the estimation of the final ethanol yield from fermentation. However, fermentation is crucial in investigating the potential inhibitory factors and effects generated during acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis, which may have significant impact on ethanol biocatalyst. In addition, it is a key stage for evaluating the overall process of cellulosic ethanol production (Yang et al., 2009). Hence, fermentation experiments in this study do not cover all aspect of microbial growth condition associated with metabolic pathway, growth rate and kinetic model on SSO substrate, and efficiency of bioethanol production, except for feasibility of fermentation performance on acid treated hydrolysate under defined laboratory conditions. 3.7.1 Microorganism

Choice of bacterial strain was made based on performance of current ethanologenic strains, as well as content and type of monomeric sugars in SSO substrate. So far, recombinant strains of Zymomonas mobilis, developed and evaluated on various agricultural residues, can convert simple sugars to ethanol quicker than other species such as yeasts (Rogers et al., 2007). Therefore, Zymomonas mobilis 8b was applied for fermentation. It is a new genomic DNA-integrated glucoseand xylose-cofermenting strain developed and described elsewhere by Zhang et al., (1995), and Mohagheghi et al., (2004). The strain was kindly provided by Dr. Ali Mohagheghi (NREL, Golden, Co, USA) through Material Transfer Agreement (MTA).

General characteristics of Zymomonas mobilis 8b including cultivation condition and productivity (Zhang, 2003; Saez-Miranda et al., 2006), as a reference for designing fermentation process, are highlighted in Table 3-8.

Inoculum Preparation and Batch Fermentation

Inoculum preparation is divided into two growth stages: revive (pre-seed) and seed. The Microbial growth in pre-seed condition is important due to building cell mass from the cell stock vial. Cell were initially grown in a 15 ml sterile falcon tube (Figure 3-11a) by transferring a stock culture frozen in cryovial to inoculate 9 mL of filter-sterilized nutrient medium containing 100 (g/L) glucose, 20 (g/L) xylose, 10 (g/L) yeast extract, and 2 (g/L) KH 2 PO 4 .

After 8 hours of static incubation at 33°C, this culture was then transferred at 2.5% (v/v) inoculum level to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flak containing 400 mL of the same medium (Figure 3-11 b). Incubation at 33°C was continued for 12­16 hours in a Thermo-Lab-Line-Barnstead MAX Q MINI 4450-Benchtop shaker operating at an agitation rate of 150 rpm (Mohagheghi et al, 2004; SaezMiranda et al, 2006).

4 Results and Discussion
This section presents summative analysis on practical and quantitative approach through implemented acidic treatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to convert lowvalue lignocellulosic waste materials into high-value product that include yield of fermentable sugar to bio-ethanol.

4.1 Compositional analysis of SSO
Summarized quantitative assessment on the composition of the SSO is presented in Table 4-1. The mass balance based on total solid is given in Figure 4-1 (more details in appendix I). As shown below, approximately, two- thirds of the original sample is moisture. Key polymeric sugars content data in oven-dried SSO was kindly provided by MBI International. The results in triplicate showed that the SSO sample includes on average 27% glucan, 5.4% xylan, 1.2% arabinan, 5.7% mannan and 1.2% galactan.

This sample with acidic nature (pH at 5 -5.5) has the lowest content of the food waste. Unlike the quality of kitchen waste that must to be rich in starch, free sugar and volatile fatty acids, these compound were not significant and detectable in the tested SSO sample.

In view of the above facts and characterization results, the following calculation hypothesizes that during pretreatment of SSO with the ATC thermal screw machine, a high degree of organic matter degradation occurs: Total Glucose = Free Glucose + Polymeric Glucose (originated from cellulose and starch) Then, in one kilogram (kg) of SSO: Woodchips = 20% = 200 grams (g), Moisture content= 66% = 660 g, Total glucose = 100.98 g glucose (29.7% on dry matter basis, calculated from glucan) Dry Solid=340 g including 200 g woodchips and 140 g other waste material (mostly supposed to be food waste)

58

Theoretically, the minimum cellulose content (glucose) in woodchips is 35% and maximum 4045% (Kumar et al, 2009). With regards to minimum content of cellulose, starch can be calculated as follows: 100.98 g glucose = [(200 * 35)/100] + starch, Starch = 28.98 g which is equal to 8.5% of dry SSO, (or 3 % of one kg SSO) The above calculation suggests that total glucose (29.7%) content in dry SSO is comprised of 21.2% glucose from woodchips and 8.5% from food waste. In support of above statement about glucose, low xylose and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), and the absence of starch in the SSO substrate, indicate that each component of food waste including starch, cellulose and protein can be degraded by some members of the microbial consortia under a suitable environmental conditions such as natural anaerobic processes, (Han & Shin, 2004; Gea et al., 2004; Bayer et al., 2007). Apparently, about 67% moisture, surrounding and impregnating the solids, is sufficient to facilitate biodegradation of organic matter in liquid phase (de Guardia et al., 2002). Finally, in spite of 82% biodegradability, 12.7% digestibility of non-pretreated SSO substrate validates the highly recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic fraction which relies on type and percent of the woodchips in composting process.

4.2 Effect of Dilute Acid Pre-treatment on SSO Substrate
SSO samples after pretreatment with dilute sulfuric acid at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% (w/w) for 15, 30 and 60 minutes were analyzed for sugar content and inhibitory compounds including furfural and HMF. Results are summarized in Table 4-3 (page 61), and indicate that pretreatment condition was not sufficient enough to solubilize cellulose and hemicelluloses. Consequently, sugar degradation byproducts were not formed. In fact, dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment did not greatly remove lignin.

59

However, based on the DA results, condition of pretreated samples with 1% (w/w) H 2 SO 4 , at 121°C for 1 hour was chosen for enzymatic treatment. Accellerase 1500 at different dosage rate was used for saccharification of cellulose and hemicelluloses portion in the DA hydrolysate, as given in the Table 4-2.

Efficiency of released glucose in enzymatic conversion of pretreated cellulose was between 8% and 10%. In fact, summarized results of enzymatic treatment efficiency in Figure 4-3 confirm ineffectiveness of DA pretreatment. Furthermore, adding ß­glucosidase (Novozyme 188) did not significantly change the performance of Accellerase 1500, and highlights the unique product formulation of this enzymes complex. This is similar to the results of conducted research on Accellerase family of enzymes conducted by Ko et al., (2009). They confirmed that use of Accellerase does not require b-glucosidase supplementation to enable more complete degradation of cellobiose unlike Celluclast 1.5L. Finally, the percent glucan conversion was not considerable and comparable to similar DA condition reported by Saha et al., (1999) and Yang et al., (2009). Typically, DA pretreatment is a chemical process governed by five parameters: temperature, residence or hydrolysis time, acid concentration, pressure, and solid loading. In order to increase the efficiency of DA pretreatment, laboratory available variables such as dilute acid concentration and residence time should be subject to further investigation.

In summary of the above facts, new sets of SSO samples with 4% (w/w) H 2 SO 4 at 1 and 4 hours, and 1% (w/w) for 2 hours, were prepared and autoclaved at 121°C as shown in Table 4-4.

As seen from the Table 4-4, increasing the residence time enhanced the loss of sugar. On the other hand, increasing the DA concentration made a drastic decrease in pH value and it could release more sugar. In this case, low pH means more volume of base (salt) was needed to adjust the pH for enzymatic treatment, which led into salt inhibition in biological process. As an ultimate attempt, the DA pretreatment with 2% (w/w) H 2 SO 4 followed by enzymatic pretreatment with cellulase enzymes loading at 60 FPU per g glucan, was conducted. Two separated and duplicated sets of SSO samples pretreated by 2% (w/w) H 2 SO 4 were used for enzymatic hydrolysate, (one with Accellerase 1500, and the second one with Celluclast 1.5L). As shown in Figure 4-4, efficiency of sugar production is similar to previous results presented in Figure 4-3.

These DA pretreatment did not present acceptable results for further investigation through fermentation. Detailed results of DA pretreatment on the SSO are presented in appendix III.

4.3 Effect of COSLIF on SSO Substrate
The new lignocellulose pre-treatment featuring modest reaction conditions, 50°C and atmospheric pressure, was demonstrated to fractionate lignocellulose portion of SSO to amorphous cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and acetic acid by using: 1) concentrated phosphoric acid (85%), as a non-volatile cellulose solvent; 2) acetone and ethanol, highly volatile organic solvents; and 3) Distilled Deionized Water (DDW) (Zhu et al., 2009). 4.3.1 Pre-assessment on COSLIF Performance on SSO Substrate

Two gram of oven-dried SSO substrate was placed in a 250 ml centrifuge bottle and mixed with 16 ml concentrated phosphoric acid (85%) with a glass rod. Then slurry was incubated at 50°C for 3 hours. After the reaction, slurry was washed with 40 ml cold acetone and centrifuged. Then
63

centrifugation with 160 ml acetone was repeated three times and black liquor (supernatants) was discarded. The pellet was washed with DDW and centrifuged. Finally, the residual pellets, containing amorphous cellulose, were neutralized to pH 4.8-5 by DDW and NH 4 OH, and then diluted to 10g glucan /L for enzymatic hydrolysis. Accellerase 1500 and Celluclast 1.5 L loading at 60 FPU per g glucan were tested on the obtained slurry from COSLIF pretreatment. As expected, Accellerase 1500 with yield value of 65.77% presented higher glucose than Celluclast 1.5L with value of 64% (Figure 4-5).

Assessment on Proper Reaction Time

The same procedure, as described in subsection 4.3.1, was implemented with different incubation times of 1, 2, and 3 hours. Treated slurry after each incubation time was tested for glucose content. Based on the results (Figure 4-6), the lack of glucose released from the slurry validated that cellulose is in the amorphous state. When treated with different enzymes, these slurries released both cellobiose and glucose. Since cellobiose is an intermediate compound for cellulose conversion to glucose, and glucose concentrations are varied for each treatment time, optimal parameters (low cellobiose remaining, high glucose released) were selected for each enzyme.
64

This evidence was further clarified as samples for each hydrolysis were taken initially and after 72 hours, and these measured concentrations were significantly different. The exhibited results were consistent with pre-assessment mentioned in subsection 4.3.1.

It was observed that the appearance of COSLIF pretreated residues with different incubation time were slightly different. Inevitably, for samples incubated for 1, 2 and 3 hours, partial loss of particles occurred during the wash and centrifugation process, and probably influenced the final glucose yield of the process. This phenomenon highlights the physics of particle-particle adhesion and interaction mechanism for the crystalline-to- amorphous transformation.

To summarize briefly, COSLIF pretreated biomass under 2 hours incubation and enzymatic digestion with Accellerase 1500 loading at 60 FPU per g glucan, presented higher glucose yield (70%) than other options (Figure 4-7). This hydrolysate was selected for further investigation in the fermentation process

4.3.3

Modified COSLIF Pretreatment and Fermentation

Six samples of 5 g SSO substrate in each of its content were prepared based on the selected results from the above section. During phosphoric acid removal, after first wash and centrifugation with cold acetone, acetone was replaced by ethanol 95% for subsequent wash and centrifugation. At the end, residual pellets were diluted to 20 g glucan/L. The average glucose yield among six samples was 89.5%, nearly 20% increase from the highest yield of the previous experiment (Figure 4-8). However, as observed from the figure, there is substantial variation between the samples, from glucose yield of 84% in sample 1 to a yield of 94% in sample 2. This may be attributed to the observed loss of particles during wash and centrifugation.

Three samples were randomly chosen for Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation process (SHF). Prior to the fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysates were sterilized by filter sterile. At the same time, a culture media based on glucose to xylose ratio in SSO composition (5:1) was constructed. Three 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks were filled with 50 ml of constructed media. Fermentation in those six batch culture samples were carried out with Zymomonas mobilis 8b.

After 24 hours of inoculation, sugar content as a measure of substrate utilization in each batch culture (Erlenmeyer flask) was quantified and results are presented in Table 4-5 and 4-6. In the constructed model, glucose (100%), and xylose (40%) were utilized while microbial growth in COSLIF pretreated samples, with approximate 17.6% glucose consumption, was not significant, as expected.

Low bacterial activity in fermentation of SSO hydrolysate may attribute to many factors including: longer lag phase for Zymomonas mobilis 8b as the adaptation time to growth condition, low growth rate on SSO hydrolysate, unavoidable contamination during sample preparation despite sterilizing hydrolysates before fermentation, and finally, lack of micronutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus). Detailed results of COSLIF pretreatment on the SSO are presented in appendix IV. 4.3.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

These images show the appearance of SSO before grinding (A), after grinding (B), and after COSLIF pretreatment (C), and each one with three magnifications as describe below:  Series 1 × 400, including A-1, B-1, and C-1  Series 2 × 100, including A-2, B-2, and C-2  Series 3: A-3 × 35, B-3 and C3 × 25

Each pretreatment process (physical and chemical) has altered the supramolecular structure of the SSO biomass. The SEM images from A and B present changes in particle size. While C shows dramatic changes in which all fibrous structures (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) in a COSLIF pretreated lignocellulosic sample were completely disrupted (Figure 4-10). These images are reasonably comparable with similar studies on avicel and corn stover shown in Figure 4-10 which draws attention to the resemblance of COSLIF pretreated SSO to them.

5 Conclusions and Scope for Future Work
5.1 Conclusions
This study investigated: 1. Composition of thermally-processed source-separated organic waste by the ATS

thermal screw machine 2. Feasibility of two acidic pretreatments, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis  Dilute sulfuric acid at 121°C and 16.2 psi  Concentrated phosphoric acid (85%) with organic solvent, acetone and ethanol, known as cellulose solvent and organic solvent-based lignocellulose fractionation (COSLIF) 3. Comparing two different cellulases, commercial enzyme complexes 4. Evaluation of selected pretreatment through fermentation by selected strain of bacteria

Results of compositional analysis (i.e. low xylose and undetectable amounts of starch) confirmed the continuous microbial degradation of food waste components including starch, cellulose and protein, under a suitable environment such as natural anaerobic conditions facilitated by sufficient moisture content, surrounding SSO feedstock. Furthermore, quantity and type of added woodchips can significantly alter the pretreatment results and production of fermentable sugars due to the strength of recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass involved in the structure of chemical bonds among cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, which differs in any single lignocellulosic matter. For instance, Douglas fir, a softwood, has been using for furniture, flooring, cabinet, and doors. This type of wood is much harder in the mechanical sense, and likely exhibits more resistance to fractionation and enzymatic hydrolysis than the hardwoods.

72

Dilute sulfuric acid, at 121°C and 16.2, hydrolyzes SSO substrate with 15% solid loading followed by enzymatic hydrolysis with 10% solid loading and different dosage of commercial biocatalysts, Accellerase 1500 and Celluclast 1.5L, was not effective or severe enough to alter the lignin shealth and produce fermentable sugar. The maximum efficiency was 10% glucose yield while concentrated phosphoric acid with acetone (COSLIF) presented a significantly higher glucose yield (70%). The efficiency of COSLIF pretreatment was improved by 20% with modified process using ethanol instead of acetone. On average glucose yield from the modified process was 89.5%. SEM images of COSLIF pretreated SSO substrate were compared with similar studies and validated the obtained results of altered crystalline cellulose to amorphous.

Accellerase 1500, as a new generation of commercial enzyme complex utilized in this study, is preferred over Celluclast 1.5L, the first generation of cellulases, as it is a more complex mixture of enzymes, containing multiple enzyme activities, mainly exoglucanase, endoglucanase, ­ glucosidase, and hemicellulase. It exhibits higher activity and efficiency with lower protein content.

Efficiency of COSLIF pretreatment was evaluated by conducting two sets of batch culture fermentation with selected strain, Zymomonas mobilis 8b, on enzymatic hydrolysate obtained from COSLIF pretreatment and constructed model of SSO substrate. In the constructed model, after 24 hours, 100% of glucose and 40% of xylose were consumed. In the enzymatic hydrolysate obtained from COSLIF, on the other hand, the fermentation slowly processed while 75% of glucose remained untouched after the same period of time. It can be concluded that this strain of bacteria favours glucose over xylose. As described before, xylose was separated from the SSO hydrolysate in the COSLIF process. Therefore, due to the lack of xylose in the system,

73

the above conclusion for the preference of glucose over xylose cannot be extended to the fermentation of enzymatic hydrolysate of SSO. Low efficiency in fermentation of SSO hydrolysate may attribute to longer lag phase for the adaptation of the strain to growth condition, unavoidable contamination during sample preparation (despite sterilization of hydrolysate before fermentation), and lack of micronutrient (N and P).

It was observed that the nature of COSLIF pretreated residues with different incubation time were slightly different. Inevitably, for samples incubated for one, two, and three hours, partial loss of particles occurred during the wash and centrifugation process, and probably influenced the final glucose yield of the process. This phenomenon highlights the physics of particle-particle adhesion and interaction mechanism for the crystalline­to­amorphous transformation.

5.2 Scope for Future Work
It is foreseen that the results of this study will reinforce the understanding of the Simultaneous Saccharification and Co-Fermentation (SSCF) process. However, a comprehensive study of the nature of lignocellulosic degradation is recommended in order to decipher the complex pathway of this degradation. To summarize, the recommendations for the future works and directions are listed as below:

1. Investigation of DA pretreatment at higher temperature and pressure facilitated by proper reactor. 2. Optimization of DA pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis based on temperature, pressure, acid concentration, solid loading, and various enzymes doses. It

74

should be mention that DA pretreatment on SSO waste at high temperature is not feasible in industrial application. 3. Optimization of COSLIF pretreatment condition under different temperature, enzyme loading, and incubation time Optimization on pretreatment method should be given to the feasibility of the proposed technology as applied to SSO waste. 4. Detailed investigation on COSLIF pretreatment which is needed to quantify soluble and insoluble compounds in solvent streams of wash and centrifugation including extracting hemicellulose from light liquor for fermenting xylose. Furthermore, evaluation on macronutrient reduction during wash and centrifugation is needed. 5. Detailed investigation on the nature of Zymomonas mobilis 8b including kinetic model of microbial growth, inhibitory factors. 6. Performance of Zymomonas mobilis 8b on SSO substrate, pretreated with either DA or COSLIF method, should be investigated on the efficiency of ethanol production using a proper bioreactor.

Appendix VI Project History

125

Since 2006, a multi-stage and collaborative research project based on cellulosic ethanol from Source-Separated Organics (SSO) waste 8 pretreated by Automation Tooling System Inc. (ATS) thermal screw machine has been conducted by Dr. G. Luk, a professor and program director of Graduate Studies at the Department of Civil Engineering at Ryerson University. Dr. Luk's research team is working on different aspects of the subject that is divided into 4 phases. It is shown in the table below. This project is unique and involved with different influential factors and parameters such as SSO characteristics, bacteria and optimal growth condition, fermentation process, and bench-scale bioreactor design. The first three phases have been successfully completed and the project would be accomplished in 2011. This thesis contributes to the last stage of phase three involving the pretreatment and saccharification investigation.

Table VI-1 Overview of the research project history Cellulosic Ethanol Production through Fractionation and Bacterial Fermentation Phase No. Subtopics Phase 1 Proof of Concept Phase 2 Growth Kinetics and Modeling of Bacterium of Interest Investigation on Feasibility of Ethanol Production:  Characterization analysis of SSO and monitoring seasonal fluctuation Phase 3  Investigation on cellulolytic bacterium in batch culture based on Consolidated Bioprocessing(CBP) system  Pretreatment and Saccharification of SSO Phase 4 Bench-scale Anaerobic Bioreactor Design
