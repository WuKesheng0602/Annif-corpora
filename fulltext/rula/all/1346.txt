Abstract

During the development of the nervous system, guidance cues provide directional information to the growth cones of migrating axons. In C. elegans, ventral to In an

dorsal migration is in part mediated by the ligand UNC-6 and its receptor UNC-5.

UNC-5 null mutant the DA and DB motor neuron axons fail to migrate in a wild type manner to the dorsal cordi despite initial dorsalward outgrowth from the cell bodies. A

genetic enhancer screen was conducted in an UNC-5 null strain and one mutant, rq1, was found to have increased axon guidance defects. To identify the mutated gene in

rq 1, microinjection experiments were performed and were able to rescue two rq 1

phenotypes.

RNAi experiments were performed where double stranded RNA

corresponding to ail the genes in the region were used individually to knock out the transcripts. Several of these were able to phenocopy the defects of rq1. The rq1

mutation could be located in any one of five genes known to be present on the rescuing cosmid while combined results implicate three strong candidate genes, M03C11.8, H04D03.1 and H04D03.4.

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Marie Killeen for her guidance and leadership. The research of Stephanie Sybingco which yielded the rq1 mutant was the basis for all of the research performed in this thesis. Sang-Hyeon Park spent many

hours peering through a microscope that were required to generate the data on the enhancement of the axon guidance phenotypes in the mutant background. The

experiments in this thesis could not have been performed without Ghanna Kholkina, her contributions can not be understated. The laboratory would not run in the summers with out the help of Viktoria Serdetchnaia. Zafar Naqvi, a fellow graduate student who hit the ground running, has been instrumental in more ways than I have space to list.
At Mount Sinai Hospital, I would like to thank Dr. Joseph Culotti and his lab for

their expertise, guidance and continued support, especially Ujia Zhang for ail of her microinjection, training, troubleshooting and advice. I would also like to thank Dr. Wendy Johnston for her analysis of the rq1 embryos and her guidance. Great appreciation needs to be extended to my family and in particular ali of my grandparental units who have been the enablers in my research endeavors.

1 Introduction

The nervous system has been the subject of intensive research since scientists were first able to observe it. Santiago Ramon y Cajal, arguably the father of modern neurology, described neurons as being polar cells which make up a vast network of interconnectivity (Cajal, 1890). Since then, great efforts have been made in order to understand how the nervous system develops its complex web of neuronal connections. It has been estimated that the human brain contains 10 X 1012 neurons and it is nearly impossible to study individual neurons in such a complex milieu. For this reason, much use has been made of organisms with more simple nervous systems such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and the fruit-fly, Drosophila

melanogaster. In these organisms neurons can be tagged and visualized using fluorescent reporter genes in specific groups or individually. The work described in this thesis uses the model organism C. elegans to study ventral to dorsal motor axon guidance.

1.1 Detailed Overview of ligand/Receptor Mediated Axon Guidance

The nervous system in higher organisms such as humans is highly conserved amongst many species. Much of our understanding of the cues and receptors involved in the development of the mammalian nervous system has been a direct result of research in model organisms such as Drosophila and C. elegans. The mechanisms of pioneer axon guidance are not completely elucidated. They can, at present, be attributed to a combination of pathways that depend on ligand expression and the expression of their

1

receptors at particular times and places during development These pathways are set up by the expression of ligands at specific locations at specific stages of development which have been proposed to create concentration gradients across the developing animaL When the specialized receptors for these ligands bind their target, they cause downstream internal cytoskeletal restructuring which ultimately leads to either an attractive or a repulsive response to the localized concentration of expressed ligand. There are five major ligands involved in nervous system development and they are Netrin/UNC-6, Slit/Sit-1, semaphorins, ephrins and Wnt (Chilton, 2006; Colavita et al.,

1998; Blelloch et al., 1999) These are depicted in Figure 1010 Sonic hedgehog, FGFs
and TGF-beta/unc-129 also play roles in nervous system development. The ligand UNC-6/Netrin is involved in many developmental processes. It was first found in C. elegans, (Ishii et al., 1992) where it is primarily involved in dorsal-ventral developmental events such as pioneer axon guidance. UNC-6 has homologues in many other organisms including humans (Moore et aL, 2007). UNC-6/Netrin has two receptors, UNC-5 and UNC-40 in C. elegans (Chan et al., 1996; Leung-Hagesteijn et al., 1992). This system is the focus of this thesis and will be discussed in depth in the sections to follow. Semaphorins are divided into classes one through eight with the third class being primarily involved in growth cone collapse (Chilton, 2006). There are two receptor families for semaphorins which are neuropilins and plexins (Chilton, 2006}. Between these two receptor families there is a complicated relationship. This is evident in the fact that plexins do not bind class 3 semaphorins while neuropilins do not bind class 4 or class 7 semaphorin, yet neuropi!ins and plexins can come together to form receptor complexes for other classes of semaphorins (Chilton, 2006). The intricacies of semaphorins and their highly specific interactions with neuropilins and plexins will not be discussed further as it is not critical to the focus of this thesis. 2

Ephrins are a family of ligands with their receptors appropriately named the Eph receptors. The ligands as well as their receptors are divided into two classes, A and B. The EphrinA and EphrinB classes bind the EphA and EphB receptors respectively. It has been demonstrated that in chick retina the A class is involved in anterior-posterior guidance and the B class is involved in dorsal-ventral guidance (Chilton, 2006). Slit, originally identified in Drosophila (Rothberg et al., 1988), and its C. elegans homologue SLT-1 (Hao et al., 2001) are primarily involved in dorsal-ventral axon guidance. In humans there are three homologues of Slit involved in neuronal development (ltoh et al., 1998). SLT-1 is expressed dorsally in C. elegans and in conjunction with its receptor, SAX-3 and in Drosophila Robo, can guide a migrating axon away from a SLT-1/Siit source (Hao et al., 2001 ). Recently, a second receptor for SLT-1 has been discovered in C. elegans, namely EVA-1 (Fujisawa et al., 2007). SLT-1/Siit is also involved in midline crossing in conjunction with the UNC-6/netrin pathway (Kidd et al., 1999). The Wnt family of ligands plays many vital roles in development. Wntlbetacatenin, for example, can function through Frizzled and Disheveled to regulate gene expression during cell fate as well as through Disheveled and Rho GTPases to regulate microtubule dynamics in Drosophila (Lu and Van Vactor, 2007). Also in Drosophila, Wnt signaling through Ryk and Derailed leads a migrating axon to be repulsed away from a Wnt source (Lu and Van Vactor, 2007). The C. elegans homologues of Wnt are lin-44,

egl-20 cwn-1, cwn-2 and mom-2, while their receptors are Frizzled/lin-17/mig-1, cfz-1,
mom-5, Ryk/lin-18 and Disheveled/dsh-1. In C. elegans, several of the Wnt family of proteins are expressed in the posterior of the animal and create a concentration gradient anteriorly. Of the five Wnt family proteins CWN-1, CWN-2, UN-44 and EGL-20 are ail

4

expressed in the extreme posterior region during the early larval stages (Gleason et al., 2006; Pan et al., 2006). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) was originally described in Drosophila as acting with its mediator Smoothened (Smo) as a midline attractive cue for migrating axons (Charron et al., 2003; Erskine and Herrera, 2007). This was demonstrated in vitro by positioning Shh expressing COS cells beside rat E 11 whole spinal cord explants and observing whether or not the migration of axons was affected by the gradient of Shh excreted by the COS cells. In this experiment, Shh was shown to be a chemo-attractant and in a similar experiment using rat spinal cord explants which did not express Smo, it was shown that Smo is required for Shh's chemo-attractive abilities (Charron et al., 2003). Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), like other developmentally expressed ligands, do not have fully elucidated roles in developmental processes. In a recent review, FGF and its receptor Fgfr1 is described as an independent guidance pathway involved in mammalian forebrain commissures crossing the midline during development (Undwall et al., 2007). Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and its C. elegans homologue unc129 is expressed dorsally in the developing nematode and is required for motor axon

guidance in the dorsal-ventral direction {Colavita et al., 1998). It was shown in C.
elegans that unc-129 is required for proper guidance of the DAIDB motor axons as

demonstrated by the observed defects in an unc-129 null allele. Since UNC-129 does not interact with any of the known TGF-beta family receptors it is hypothesized that UNC-129 either interacts with UNC-5 to regulate sensitivity in the UNC-6/Netrin pathway or that UNC-129 may participate in a separate signaling pathway (Colavita et al., 1998). The localization of guidance cue expression in C. elegans is depicted in Figure 1.2.

1.2 C. elegans as a Model Organism

Caenorhabditis elegans was popularized as a model organism by Nobel laureate

Dr. Brenner (Brenner, 1974 ). The simplicity of the soil dwelling nematode, found throughout the world, combined with the minimal care requirements of the organism made it an ideal candidate as a model organism. It is used as a model system to study a range of events such as apoptosis and cell fate to RNAi and the development and function of nervous system. In 1998 scientists received an incentive to work with the model organism in the form of a fully sequenced genome. C. elegans was the first multicellular organism to have its genome fully sequenced. The importance of a fully sequenced genome can not be understated. It provides a foundation upon which large bodies of scientific evidence can be built. With the more recent completion of the human genome, and even more recent completion of Dr. Craig Venter's genome, the genetic discoveries made in C. elegans become even more relevant due to its homology with humans. C. elegans are nematodes of approximately one millimeter in length and are barely visible at full adulthood with the naked eye. They are temperature sensitive with a decreased generation time at higher temperatures while lower temperatures retard their progression to adulthood. At 20°C the generation time is three days from embryo to reproductive viability. A population of C. elegans consists mainly of hermaphrodites with males making up 0.02% of the population (Brenner, 1974). They are diploid eukaryotes with six chromosomes named by the roman numerals I through V as well as a sex chromosome called X and the entire genome is approximately 1OOMbp and is predicted to contain just under 20,000 genes (Riddle et al., 1997). Their hermaphroditic reproduction makes them ideal as a genetic model organism. A sole parent allows recessive genetic lines to be carried indefinitely. Their relatively short generation time
7

lends itself well to classical genetic manipulations since large homozygous populations can be cultured easily. A diagrammatic representation of C. elegans is shown in Figure
1.3.

One obvious advantage of C. elegans is their transparency. Their transparency allows researchers with access to basic microscopic facilities insight into the internal structures of the nematode in vivo (Hope, 1999). This is crucial, since many studies attempt to relate in vitro scientific evidence to in vivo processes while work in C. elegans is able to bypass this hindrance. The life cycle consists of four larval stages appropriately named L1 , L2 , L3 and L4 coinciding with molting processes. After the L4 larval stage the nematodes enter young adulthood and become fertile while beginning sexual reproduction . Full adult nematodes can live for several days, and up to a week at optimal conditions. When confronted with starvation, C. elegans have the ability to alter their life cycle. Instead of progressing from

L2 to L3 , when faced with starvation, they proceed to the Dauer larval stage from the L2
stage. A Dauer larval nematode can survive in adverse starvation conditions for up to four months. If conditions improve, Dauer larval C. elegans bypass the L3 larval stage and progress directly to L4 from which a normal progression to adulthood is followed (Jorgensen and Mango, 2002).

1.3 Development of the C. elegans Nervous System

There are three main structures of the nervous system located throughout the body of the nematode. The nerve ring is located at the head of the animal around the pharynx. The ventral nerve cord runs along the ventral midline of the animal and ·dorsal nerve cord mirrors the ventral nerve cord running along the dorsal midline of the animal (White et al., 1986). The ventral and dorsal cords are located between the epidermis and the basal lamina of the epidermis. The epidermal basal lamina is required to compartmentalize the nerve cords and their projected axons between the epidermis and the interior mesoderm and musculature (Hedgecock et al., 1990). The focus will remain primarily on motor neurons that originate at the ventral nerve cord. Wild type {N2) hermaphrodite C. elegans have a total of 302 neurons of 118 distinct different types. These groups are made up of neurons that have the same morphology but different locations throughout the body of the nematode {White et al., 1986). There are several classes of neurons, grouped according to their function. The classes are sensory, mechanosensory, motor neurons and the interneurons. The sensory group of neurons is responsible for the nematode's chemosensory abilities. The mechanosensory group of neurons is responsible for the nematode's ability to sense applied pressure. The motor neurons are responsible for controlling the musculature of the animal and the interneuron group makes up for the various levels of interconnectivity {White et al., 1986). There are thirty classes of motor neurons of which only eight

originate from cell bodies along the ventral nerve cord. Four of the eight are associated with the ventral muscles, VA, VB, VD and VC, while the other four are associated with the dorsal muscles, DA, DB, DD and AS (White et al., 1986). Most develop postembryonically, the exceptions are the DA and DB motor neurons which develop during embryonic stages. The DA and DB motor neurons communicate with their post-synaptic

10

partners by release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine while other motor neurons including the VD and DD motor neurons use gamma-aminobuteric acid as their neurotransmitter (White et al., 1986). The nervous system structure is shown in Figure

1.4.

During the development of a motor neuron, the cell body extends large numbers of projections, many of which are short and function as dendrites. One projection, however, becomes vastly elongated and functions as the axon, making synaptic junctions with the dendrites of other cell bodies (Huber et al., 2003). The tip of a migrating axon is referred to as the growth cone. The growth cone is made up of lamellipodia and filopodia. Filopodia are named as such since they resemble spiky filaments which stretch out in the direction of migration out of a migrating llamellipodia. Together they make up the leading edge of a migrating growth cone (Cramer, 1997). The migration of both lamellipodia and filopodia rely on the directional polymerization of actin. In lamellipodia, networks of cross-linked actin polymerizing in a single direction from the "+" end mediates migration direction. In filopodia, migration is due to the localized directional polymerization of bundled F-actin (Huber et al., 2003). It is these two processes that mobilize the growth cone in a particular direction. The direction of growth cone migration is much more complicated and ultimately a result of complex extracellular guidance cues. A schematic diagram of the growth cone's migration pattern is presented in Figure 1.5.

1.4. The UNC-6/Netrin System

C. elegans UNC-6 is a laminin-like molecule (Ishii et al., 1992) which serves as a bifunctional guidance cue for dorsal-ventral migration. Netrin/UNC-6 is a ligand secreted ventrally along the midline of the animal (Wadsworth et al., 1996). The localized expression sets up a ventral to dorsal concentration gradient of the ligand (Figure 1. 7). There are two single pass transmembrane receptors for UNC-6 in C. elegans which are UNC-5 and UNC-40 (Chan et al., 1996; Leung-Hagesteijn et al., 1992). Expression of UNC-40 alone on the growth cone of a migrating axon causes attraction to an UNC-6 source while expression of UNC-5, alone or in the presence of UNC-40, causes repulsion from an UNC-6 source (Merz and Culotti, 2000). A diagram illustrating the UNC-6/netrin system is presented in Figure 1.6. Netrin is the vertebrate homologue of UNC-6 (Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995; Serafini et al., 1996). Homologues of UNC-40 are Frazzled in D. melanogaster and DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) in vertebrates (Culotti and Merz, 1998). Homologues of UNC-5 are also called UNC-5 in many other systems since the protein was first identified in C. elegans, however, in vertebrates Rostral cerebellar malformation (Rem) is used interchangably (Ackerman et al., 1997). In many higher organisms several homologues of the C. elegans UNC-5 are present. For example, in humans there are UNC-5 versions A through D (Leonardo et al., 1997; Round and Stein, 2007). The role of the netrin pathway proteins in growth cone migration along with a schematic of UNC-6/netrin is presented in Figure 1.7. The interaction of UNC-40 with UNC..,5 is ligand-dependent and it has been demonstrated that UNC5H2 co-precipitated with DCC from COS-1 cells only in the presence of netrin-1 (Hong et al., 2000). They also showed that UNC-5H2 residues 707-724 are required for proper function and thus this domain is named DB for its requirement in binding DCC.

The UNC-6/netrin pathway in C. elegans is not exclusive to dorsal-ventral pioneer axon migration. The wild type migration of the gonad is also dependant on the UNC-6 pathway. Gonad distal tip cell defects are observed in UNC-5 null mutants leading to a displacement of the gonad in adults (Figure 1.8 and Su et al., 2000). The gonad migrates in three major phases. The first phase consists of the distal tip cell migrating away from the vulva toward the anterior or posterior of the animal depending on the gonad arm. The second phase consists of a ninety degree turn toward the dorsal side of the animal followed by ventral to dorsal migration of the distal tip cell. The third phase consists of a second ninety degree turn back toward the vulva along the dorsal side of the animal. In all, the distal tip cell undergoes two changes of direction and three periods of directional migration (Su et al., 2000). In UNC-5 null mutants, eliminating UNC-6's repulsive effects, the distal tip cell fails to make the ventral to dorsal migration of phase two resulting in a gonad which simply folds back on itself as shown in Figure 1.8. This defect is clearly visible using a dissection microscope (Hedgecock et al., 1990; Su et al., 2000; Killeen et al., 2002).

1.5 UNC ..s; a Transmembrane Receptor

The unc-5 gene which codes for the UNC-5 protein was first described as a single pass transmembrane receptor in 1992 (Leung-Hagesteijn et aL, 1992). The gene is located at + 1. 78 of chromosome IV. The gene product encodes a 919 amino acid protein with one helical transmembrane region (TM). The amino terminal extracellular region consists of two immunoglobulin (lg) domains and two thrombospondin type 1 (Tsp) domains (Leung-Hagesteijn et al., 1992). lntracellularly, there is a juxta membrane domain (JM) proximal to a transmembrane domain (TM), followed by a ZD domain, a ZU-5 domain and a death domain (DD) (Killeen et al., 2002). The null allele of unc-5 used frequently in experiments is unc-5(e53). The unc-5(e53) null is the result of a premature stop codon mutation resulting in a peptide chain of only 283 amino acids (Killeen et al., 2002). This mutation codes for an UNC-5 protein which only codes for two lg domains and one Tsp domain with the second Tsp domain being interrupted by the premature stop codon. Regulation of UNC-5's cell surface expression through endocytosis is the mechanism by which a migrating growth cone is able to mediate its repulsive sensitivity to a netrin/UNC-6 source. The mechanism of UNC-5 endocytosis was elucidated in a vertebrate system. It was demonstrated that surface expression of UNG-5H1 is regulated by C-kinase-1 (PICK1) and protein kinase C (PKC) (Williams et al., 2003b). The activation PKC results in the formation of complexes of UNC-5H1/PKC/PICK which leads to the endocytosis of UNC-5H1 (Williams et al., 2003b). Alternate splicing is an emerging field of study. Scientists are comparing mRNA sequences of the same gene and finding radical differences. In C. elegans no known alternate splicing of UNC-5 has been described, but in the adult rat spinal cord, the unc5 homologues unc5h3 and unc5h 1 do transcribe two different forms of mRNA (Man itt et

20

al., 2004 ). Northern blot analysis of the adult rat spinal cord showed that unc5h3 yielded two mRNA transcripts at -12kb and -1 Okb (Manitt et al., 2004 ). Work from the same group described the discovery through RT -PCR that unc5h 1 in adult rat spinal cord also exhibits two splice variants. They were able to sequence the mRNAs and found that the shorter of two mRNAs for unc-5h11acked a second TSP domain (Manitt et aL, 2004). The UNC-5 transmembrane receptor is not solely involved in developmental guidance cue signaling; it is also involved in apoptosis as illustrated through UNC-Sa knockout mice (Williams et al., 2006). Apoptosis was decreased and the number of neurons in the spinal cord was increased regardless of the presence or absence of netrin-1 in an UNC-5a knockout mouse (Williams et al., 2006). Previously the same group showed that apoptosis is a result of UNC-5a's JM region interacting with NRAGE (Williams et al., 2003a). Although interesting, the involvement of UNC-5 in apoptotic processes will not be discussed in detail.

1.6 Calcium and Netrin Signalling

Calcium levels play an integral role in netrin signaling since the concentration of Ca 2+ can have direct effects on axon guidance. It was demonstrated that netrin signaling through interaction with DCC caused an influx of Ca 2+ into a pioneer axon. As previously described, the result of netrin interaction with DCC on the growth cone of a migrating pioneer axon leads to migration toward the netrin source. By significantly lowering the Ca 2 + levels within the neuron it was shown that this characteristic attraction to the netrin source could be reversed. Thus in situations of low Ca 2+ concentration netrin signaling through DCC results in repulsion of a migrating pioneer axon away from a netrin source (Hong et al., 2000).

21

It has also been shown that the ratio of cAMP to cGMP has a very similar effect on pioneer axon guidance (Ming et aL, 1997) leading the author of a recent review to hypothesize that the two substances are linked (Round and Stein, 2007). It is hypothesized that at high levels of cAMP to cGMP, netrin induces an attractive response through DCC by allowing Ca 2+ to be channeled into the growth cones, while at low levels of cAMP to cGMP, Ca 2+ is not channeled into the growth cones and a causes a repulsive response (Round and Stein, 2007). Studies in Xenopus have demonstrated that transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs), which are Ca 2 + channels, are involved in Ca 2 + influx as a result of netrin signaling (Wang and Poo, 2005). Since PLCy activates TRPCs and netrin signalling through DCC activates PLCy a model begins to emerge. Currently, it is proposed that netrin signaling through DCC activates PLCy, and PLCy activates TRPCs, which results in the netrin induced regulation of Ca 2+ levels in a migrating pioneer axon (Round and Stein, 2007). Several other interesting observations have been made involving the role of Ca 2+ in netrin signaling. Desensitization to netrin concentrations is observed with a reduction in Ca 2+ (Ming et al., 1997). Also, signaling and transcriptional changes induced through the netrin pathway are dependant upon regulation of Ca 2+ (Round and Stein, 2007). Much about Ca 2+ signaling in relation to pioneer axon guidance is as of yet unknown and it will be interesting to see how future work develops our understanding of this relationship.

1. 7 Downstream of

UNC~6's

Interaction With UNCa5

The UNC-6 receptors in C. elegans are relatively ambiguous in structure since their motifs do not hint at any one candidate interacting partner. However, there has

22

been some significant effort to elucidate the downstream members of the netrin pathway. It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for UNC-5's function (Killeen et al., 2002) and it has been demonstrated that UNC-6 binding UNC-5 leads to UNC-5 phosphorylation in both nematodes and vertebrates (Tong et al., 2001 ). This was proven through disruption in UNC-5 phosphorylation leading to failure of the gene to rescue unc-5(e53) axon guidance defects in C. elegans (Killeen et al., 2002). Investigations into these phosphorylation events have uncovered the interaction between the UNC-6 receptors and the Src family kinases. In C. elegans it has been demonstrated that SRC-1 interacts with UNC-5 (Lee et al., 2005) and more recently the requirement of FAK along with the Src family of kinases for the phosphorylation ofUNC5 in response to UNC-6 (Li et al., 2006). This has also been mirrored in studies in vertebrate systems (Liu et al., 2004). It has been shown that protein kinase 2 (the vertebrate homolog of FAK) is required in conjunction with the Src family kinases for the proper functioning of the netrin system (Uu et al., 2004). Kinases are not the only proteins known to interact with UNC-5 as a result of netrin signaling. Shp2, a phosphatase, also interacts with UNC-5 (Tong et al., 2001 ). There are several possibilities that have been hypothesized as to the purpose of the Shp2 interaction with UNC-5. One possibility is that they are working through the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade (MAPK) which has been shown to be required for netrin mediated axon guidance (Round and Stein, 2007). Phospholipase Cy (PLCy) may be downstream of the UNC-5-Shp2 complex in the form of an inducer of endocytosis (Round and Stein, 2007). Another possibility is that PI3K is involved. PI3K is upstream of MIG1 0 which is involved in netrin induced lamellipodail outgrowth (Adler et al., 2006). A final possibility is that RhoA may be involved in UNC-5 function. RhoA is known to be down regulated by Shp2 and RhoA is also known to be involved, along with

23

guanine exchange factors, in microtubule dynamics (Round and Stein, 2007). A schematic showing a proposed downstream pathway for UNC-5 is shown in Figure 1.9.

1.8 The rq1 mutant strain

A commonly used technique to identify genes involved in any specific process is to screen a population of animals that have been treated with chemicals that introduce random mutations for observable defects. An enhancer screen is any screen where one aims to enhance an existing phenotype. The identification of the rq1 mutant qualifies as an enhancer screen, since nematodes with pre-existing axon guidance defects were mutated and their progeny screened for nematodes with increased axon guidance defects. A detailed description of the discovery and subsequent analysis of the mutant
rq1 is presented in the following subsections.

1.8.1 Mutagenesis of C. elegans with the unc-5 null genetic background yielded the rq1 mutant

Mutagenesis was conducted as described in Figure 1.1 0. The strain used for the screen was the netrin receptor mutant, unc-5(53) transgenic for an integrated version of the reporter construct [unc-129::gfp + dpy-20] which allows detection of the DA and DB classes of motor neurons (Colavita et al., 1998). This strain is also known as eviS82b. Mutagenesis was performed by soaking L3-L4 animals in an ethylmethyl sulfonate (EMS} solution which is known to cause primarily G/C to AfT transition (Hope, 1999). In the F2 generation, post exposure to EMS, the mutagenized population was screened under epiflurorescence for animals where the DA/DB cell bodies failed to project axons in the dorsal direction (Sybingco 2008). As previously described, the DA/DB motor neurons have cell bodies located along the ventral cord and they project axons dorsally (White et al., 1986). These axons

26

normally migrate all the way from the ventral cord to the dorsal cord (Figure 1.11 A). The
unc-5(e53) mutation causes DA/DB axon guidance defects (Hedgecock et al., 1990).

The failure of the axons to successfully migrate dorsally to form the dorsal cord is a result of premature turning in the anterior posterior direction. In an unc-5(e53) background, despite the inability to create a functional UNC-5 transmembrane receptor, the DA/DB motor neuron cell bodies are still able to project an axon in the general dorsal direction and it is only after one to two thirds of the ventral to dorsal migration that the axons prematurely alter their migration path (Figure 1.11 B). This suggests that there is some factor involved in ventral to dorsal migration of the DAIDB motor axons that is independent of UNC-5.

1.8.3. Distal Tip Cell Defects and the rq1 Mutant

As previously mentioned, a disruption in the ability of UNC-6 to signal through
UNCa5 also results in animals that display distal tip cell defects. These defects are due

to the failure of the distal tip cells to migrate dorsally, causing the gonad to fold back on itself (Su et al., 2000). If the rq1 mutation caused an enhancement in gonad defects as well as the observed enhancement of axon guidance defects it could be that the rq1 gene is expressed in the distal tip cell as are both UNC-5 and UNC-40 (Chan et al., 1996; Su et al., 2000). Upon investigation, the rq1 mutant demonstrated no enhancement of gonad defects (Sybingco, 2008) as shown in Table 1.1. This suggests that its activity is not present or at least has no apparent infl.uence on the guidance of the distal tip ceiL

1.8.4 The rq1 Mutant Exhibits a Low Brood Size

The rq1 mutant was found to have another phenotype aside from the motor axon guidance defects observed in the unc-5(e53) background. Severe embryonic lethality was observed in both wild type and unc-5(e53) backgrounds. The rq1 mutation alone causes a 50% decrease in brood size in a wild type background while in the unc-5(e53) background it causes a 75°/o decrease in brood size (Sybingco, 2008) as shown in Figure 1.13.

Figure 1.13: rq1 causes reduced brood sizes The brood sizes of the rq1 mutant were quantified over several days. Embryonic lethality was observed in both rq1 in an otherwise wild type and unc-5(e53) backgrounds with the
unc-5(e53) background being more severe (Sybingco, 2008). The mutant rq1 does not

appear to have significant embryonic lethality so this defect is caused by rq1.

34

Preliminary investigations were performed to determine the nature of the observed embryonic lethality in rq1. rq1 embryos were stained with Hoescht 33258 stain, anti-chitin and anti-wheat germ agglutinin. The chitin and Hoescht visualized images were of particular interest. A chitin shell is only present if the egg has been fertilized (Zhang et al., 2005). Hoescht staining allows the visualization of the nuclei. The wheat germ agglutinin stains the cell membrane. The chitin staining revealed that the rq1 eggs are fertilized, however the Hoescht stain revealed irregular, diffuse nuclei. (Figure 1.14). From this result it was found that the rq1 mutation may cause a problem with cytokenesis (Johnston, 2008).

Staining indicates the egg is fertilized yet exhibits diffuse, irregular nuclei possibly the result of a problem with cellular division (photo produced by Dr. Johnston, 2008).

1.9 Mapping of rq1 on the C. elegans genome

The mutation responsible for the phenotypes observed in the rq1 mutant was mapped using the snip-SNP technique (Sybingco, 2008). The snip-SNP technique is named for its use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that interrupt restriction enzyme recognition sequences (Davis et al., 2005). To summarize, the mutant strain in an N2 background is crossed with a wild type CB4856 strain (Hawaiian strain) and it is the differences between SNPs the two strains that makes the technique possible. The subsequent F2 progeny are then screened for the presence or absence of the mutant phenotypes effectively setting up positive and negative pools. Specific regions of DNA from various locations on each chromosome are amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from both the positive and negative pools. These PCR fragments contain a SNP known to interrupt a restriction enzyme site in one background but not the other. The PCR products from both pools are digested and the resultant fragments are separated on agarose gels. In regions to which the mutation is not closely linked one will observe the same heterozygous banding patterns in both pools due to the random genetic crossover in gamete formation. However, in regions to which the mutation is closely linked, the positive pool will exhibit the homozygous N2 banding patterns while the negative pool will exhibit either the Hawaiian or the heterozygous banding patterns. The homozygous N2 banding pattern is observed in the region genetically linked to the mutation since the positive pool must be homozygous for the mutation as a result of its ability to express the recessive mutant phenotype. Since the positive pool is homozygous for the mutation, it will also be homozygous for the N2 SNPs that are close to the mutation due to lack of crossing over. The snip-SNP technique is described in detail by Davis et al. (2005).

36

The rq1 mutation was mapped to chromosome mat a genetic location of 2.126 to 3.963. This region contains 76 putative genes which consist of both known and predicted open reading frames (Sybingco, 2008). When snip-SNP mapping had been exhausted a candidate gene approach was taken. One candidate gene was atx-2 which was identified as a candidate gene for several reasons. As mentioned, rq1 exhibits low brood size and embryonic lethality (Figure 1.13 and 1.14) and a previous genome-wide RNAi screen identified the atx-2 gene as the only gene in the entire interval on chromosome Ill within the region where
rq1 was mapped with very early embryonic lethality of the type seen in rq1 (Sonnichsen

et al., 2005). Furthermore, its potential involvement in the nervous system made atx-2 a prime candidate. atx-2 is the C. elegans orthologue of the human ataxin 2 gene which is known to be involved in one form of human spinocerebellar ataxia (Ciosk et al., 2004 ). Spinocerebellar ataxia is a dominant human progressive neurological disease somewhat similar to Huntingtons choreR

1.1 0. Microinjection in C. elegans

Mi.croinjection, although not technically easy, is a common method for introducing DNA into C. elegans (Mello et al., 1991 ). The technique takes advantage of the hermaphroditic nature of the reproductive system in C. elegans. DNA is prepared by alkaline lysis of bacterial cell lines (Birnboim and Doly, 1979) then is injected directly into the core cytoplasmic region of a young adult nematode's gonad. The distal region of the gonad consists of a sheath of unfertilized germ nuclei arrested in meiosis I surrounding a core region of cytoplasm. Importantly, the nuclei are not enclosed in a membrane and only become enveloped, along with a portion of the core cytoplasm, as they mature

37

toward the proximal region of the gonad (Gibert et al., 1984; Kimble and White, 1981 ). The concentration of DNA injected was determined to have no effect on the maximum number of transgenic F1 animals observed, however a minimum concentration for optimal transgenic frequency was determined to be approximately 1OOuglmL (Mello et al., 1991 ). Transgenic F1 animals exhibited non-Mendelian patterns of inheritance which indicates that injected DNA remains extrachromosomal (Mello et al., 1991 ). F2 inheritance of transgenic DNA was shown to be low and quite variable. In further experimentation it was shown that inheritance of extrachromosomal injected DNA from transgenic F1 to transgenic F2 was case sensitive depending on the properties of the extrachromosomal injected DNA itself (Mello et al., 1991 ).

1.11 RNAi in C. elegans

Dr. Andrew Fire and Dr. Craig Mello won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2006 for their discovery of gene silencing by double.. stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) in C. elegans. The discovery was made in the mid 90s and their landmark paper was published in 1998 (Fire et al., 1998). They coined the term RNAi meaning the RNA inhibition. The method involves introduction of dsRNA into the cytosol of cells which ultimately causes the cessation of protein production at the translational stage (Parker et at., 2006). There are three methods of introducing dsRNA into C. elegans. dsRNA can be directly injected into the gonad of the nematode (Fire et al., 1998), the nematodes can be bathed in a solution of dsRNA (Tabara et al., 1998) or the nematodes can be fed a bacterial strain expressing the desired dsRNA (Timmons and Fire, 1998). There are advantages and disadvantages to each technique.

38

The injection technique requires a small amount of dsRNA and is highly efficient, however, it is not suited to high throughput experiments since the technique is quite time consuming and requires specialized microinjection equipment. The bathing technique is suitable for high throughput experiments and screening large numbers of animals, however it requires a large quantity of purified dsRNA. The easiest technique technically is the feeding technique, however, this assumes one can create or obtain a bacterial strain expressing the desired dsRNA. Bacterial strains expressing dsRNA used to feed C. elegans lack the dsRNA-specific RNase-111-like endonucleases to ensure dsRNA is not degraded prior to ingestion by the nematodes (Kamath et aL, 2003). While the efficiency of RNAi through the feeding method is the lowest of the three, the simplicity of the technique and adaptability to high throughput experimentation makes it the most common method of performing RNAi experiments. The molecular mechanism of RNAi is relatively well understood. Once dsRNA is present in the cytosol of a cell, in C. elegans, the protein RDE-4 binds the dsRNA and, although it is not yet understood how or why, recruits the RNase Ill enzyme DICER (Parker et al., 2006). DICER cleaves the dsRNA into short 20-25bp segments called small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA} (Zamore et aL, 2000). The one strand of the siRNA is called the guide strand and is incorporated into the enzyme RISC (RNAinduced silencing complex} and serves as a
temp~ate

for recognition of complementary

mRNA (Bernstein et al., 2001 ). The endonuclease component of the RISC complex is Argonaute which binds the guide strand of siRNA and cleaves the complementary mRNA. This renders the mRNA useless, effectively silencing the gene from which the mRNA was transcribed (Rand et al., 2005). This method of gene silencing is highly conserved among many other species including humans. This powerful gene silencing technique does have its limitations. For reasons unknown, RNAi does not work in all C. elegans tissues. In fact, the nervous

39

system remains relatively refractive to gene silencing through RNAi (Kamath et al., 2003). This can become a limiting factor in C. elegans based neurological research since direct RNAi screens can not be readily pertormed. Another hurdle in studies using RNAi is the residence time of proteins. Proteins that are expressed pre-RNAi treatment can have long residence times in the organism. Due to the technique targeting mRNA rather than the protein itself, complete knockout of a protein can not be assured despite inhibition efforts through RNAi (Kamath et al., 2003).

1.12 Hypothesis

The hypothesis of the work described in this thesis is that there are other molecules involved in the ventral to dorsal guidance of the DA and DB motor neurons in C. elegans, in addition to those in the UNC-6/netrin pathway. This can be demonstrated by finding mutants where the axon guidance defects of the strains mutant for genes in the netrin pathway are enhanced, such as rq1 (Sybingco 2008}. Once such mutants have been found, the genes must be identified. It should be determined if the mutated genes are, in fact responsible for the enhancement of the DA and DB motor axon guidance defects and whether or not they are acting within the UNC-6/netrin pathway. The first mutant for which this analysis was undertaken was rq1 but this will be followed by the analysis of at least two other mutants isolated independently in the same screen (Sybingco 2008).

40

1.13 Specific objective of thesis work

The specific objective of the work described in this thesis was to locate the open reading frame and identify the gene responsible for the rq1 phenotypes from among the 80 or so predicted genes in the interval where it was mapped (Sybingco 2008). The mutant rq1 was identified through a genetic enhancer screen performed in an unc-5 null background and mutants that enhanced the defects of unc-5(e53) were selected (Sybingco, 2008). Three such mutants were identified in the original screen, rq1, rq2 and
rq3. Genetic identification of rq1 was approached using two techniques considered to be

forward and reverse genetic experiments. The rescue of phenotypes was attempted using microinjection of cosmids carrying DNA derived from the region where rq1 was mapped (Sybingco, 2008) which is considered a forward genetic experiment. The second technique, the RNAi approach, was used to inhibit mRNAs in the region where
rq1 was mapped to determine which genes recreate (phenocopy) the phenotypes of the

mutant. It was expected that a mutation in a single gene would be responsible for the phenotypes observed in rq1 since unlinked mutations were eliminated by several outcrosses of the strain with non-mutant animals (Sybingco 2008). The top candidate gene prior to these experiments was atx-2 due to its location and involvement in cytokenesis.

2.1 Strains, Media and Handling of Animals

The strains used in this work were N2, LGIII: rq1; LG IV, dpy-20(e1282), unc5(e53), LGX, unc-6(ev400). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was grown and

handled as outlined in Brenner (1974). Solid nematode growth media (NGM) was used to grow the E. coli strain OP50, which served as the source of nutrition for the nematodes. The OP50 strain grows to a thin lawn on NGM media due to its growth being stunted as a result of its inability to synthasize uracil (Hope, 1999). The NGM media was prepared by autoclaving 3g/L NaCI, 2.5g/L Bacto peptone, 17g/L agar followed by cooling to -55°C and adding 1 ml of 1M CaCb, 1ml of 1M MgS04, 25m! of 1M KH2P0 4 and 1ml of 5mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol per liter A 20°C incubator was used for growing all strains while manipulations were carried out at room temperature which also averaged approximately 20°C. Leica dissection microscopes were used for routine manipulations while Leica epifluorescent dissection and upright microscopes were used for screening and analysis of phenotypes. Table 2.1 lists all strains used in the experiments described.

2.2 Microinjection

The C. elegans strains used for microinjection were the UNC-5 null strain unc5(e53); dpy-20(e1282) [unc129::gfp;dpy-20] and the mutant rq1*3;unc-5(e53); dpy20(e1282) {unc129::gfp;dpy-20]. Cosmid clones were generously donated by the Sanger

Centre in England (Table 2.2). Cosmids arrived as bacterial stabs which were streaked onto LB (1 Og/L tryptone, 5g/L NaCI, 5g/L yeast extract) + 1Oo/o w/v agar with 1OOug/mL ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37°C. Individual colonies were_ picked and grown in liquid LB with 1OOug/mL ampicillin and cos mid DNA isolation was performed by the alkaline lysis method (Birnboim and Doly, 1979). Fosmid clones were generously donated by the Culotti laboratory at Mount Sinai HospitaL Fosmids arrived as bacterial colonies on selective media (1 OOug/mL ampicillin) and fosmid DNA was also isolated using the alkaline lysis method (Birnboim and Doly, 1979). Table 2.2 lists all cosmids and fosmids used in the microinjection experiments. Two co-injectable markers were injected, however only one was used in data acquisition. Odr-1::gfp is expressed in the olfactory neurons in the head of the animal (L'Etoile and Bargmann, 2000). Odr-1::gfp was a generous donation of DL Peter Roy's laboratory at the University of Toronto. This co-injectable marker was difficult to work with as it was too faint. The prefered co-injectable marker was myo-2::yfp which was generously donated by the Culotti laboratory at Mount Sinai Hospital. Myo-2::yfp DNA was transformed into DH5a E. coli cells which were also grown in selective media (1 OOug/ml ampicillin). The co-injectable marker DNA was also isolated using the alkaline lysis method (Birnboim and Doly, 1979; Sambrook et al., 1989). Myo-2 codes for a myosin heavy chain isoform which is only expressed in the pharynx of the animal and its promoter was used to drive YFP (Miller et aL, 1986), The advantage of using a myo-

43

2::yfp reporter in this experiment was the absence of any overlap between the

fluorescent structures. The myo-2::yfp is expressed at the extreme anterior of the animal in the pharynx while the DA/DB motor neurons are located along the ventral cord of the animal with their axons being projected dorsally. All DNA was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Agarose gels were 0.7% agarose in TAE (40mM Tris, 1.0mM EDTA, adjusted to pH 8.3 with glacial acetic acid). The electrophoresis was performed at constant voltage ( 1OOV) for approximately one hour in liquid TAE buffer. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) was used to visualize the DNA under trans-ultraviolet light which was digitally photographed (Sambrook et al., 1989). The EtBr was added to the agarose gel previous to casting and solidification. Reporter-cosmid/fosmid DNA mixture was injected at an approximate

concentration of 1OOng/uL from the alkaline lysis isolate with no extra treatment save for centrifugation at top speed, 14krpm in a micro-centrifuge, for ten minutes prior to injection. The injection technique was adapted from Mello et a/., (1991 ), Mello and Fire (1995). A microinjection apparatus was used obtained from Sutter Instruments. The apparatus uses compressed nitrogen gas to provide pressure to the injection system in combination with a Zeiss inverted microscope. Borosilicate glass capillaries with an internal diameter of 0.75mm were pulled to a point using P-97 Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instruments) and filled with 1.5ul of cosmid/fosmid and coinjectable marker DNA mixture. Another capillary was manually pulled to a fine rod and placed on a cover slip in Halocarbon inert oil. This filament was used to break open the tip of the pointed capillary containing the DNA under the microscope. Injections were performed on young adult stage nematodes which were mounted on 1°/o agarose pads. The pads were created by drying 1°/o agarose in water onto Fisher brand cover slips. Injections were made directly into the distal core cytoplasm of the gonad arm at a pressure of approximately 22psi. The pressure of injection varied

44

inversely with the diameter of the needle. Successful injection was judged visually and

based on the inflation of the distal gonad arm after injection (see Figure 2.1 ). Upon
successful injection the nematodes were transferred to a drop of M9 solution on an NGM

plate with a lawn of OP50 E. coli.

2.3 RNAi

The Ahringer RNAi library used had clones obtained by generous donation of Dr. Peter Roy at the University of Toronto (Fraser et al., 2000). The bacterial strain used to create the library was E. coli HT115{DE3). The plasmid used to create the library was pl4440. pL4440 is IPTG inducible for T7 polymerase and carries a resistance for carbenicillin. NGM plates were used with several addititions. Carbenicillin was added at a final concentration of 25ug/ml and IPTG at a final concentration of 1mM. Bacterial library strains were grown first in liquid broth containing 50ug/ml ampicillin overnight then seeded onto the modified NGM media in 3cm diameter Petri dishes. Two C. elegans strains were used in this experiment: unc-5 (e53); dpy-20 (e1282); [unc-129::gfp + dpy20] and N2.

The protocol followed was written by the Ahringer laboratory specifically for RNAi using the library they created and it is available at their website

(wvvw.gurdon .cam.ac.ukl-ahringeriab/index.html). Briefly, several l3 nematodes were

placed on the 3cm mqdified NGM plates seeded with the desired dsRNA expressing bacterial strain. They were incubated for three to four days until the F1 progeny have reached adulthood. The adult F1 generation was screened microscopically for the presence of 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype as described in section 2.4.

47

2.4 Analysis of Phenotypes

The F1 progeny of the microinjected nematodes were screened for yellow fluorescence protein expression in the smooth muscle tissue of the pharynx using a Leica epifluorescent dissection microscope. Presence of the YFP-fusion protein coinjectable marker indicated the nematode was indeed transgenic at which point it was transferred to another seeded NGM plate. Once the transgenic animals had laid their first brood they were mounted onto 2%> agarose in M9 buffer pads on Fisher brand glass microscope slides in a drop of M9 buffer and covered with a cover slip for observation. Nematodes were screened for the presence of outgrowing axons from DA and DB cell bodies visualized using the presence of the transgene [unc...,129::gfp + dpy-20]. This transgene is also known as evls82B (Colavita et al., 1998). Screening was performed using a Leica upright epifluorescent microscope using 20x, 40x and 63x objectives. The first five anterior cell bodies were omitted from the screening due to the wide range of variability. Post axonal screening, the nematodes were transferred back to a seeded NGM plate and left to recover for 3-4h prior to screening for 'spoon shaped' gonads. Screening for 'spoon shaped' gonads was performed for both rescue of phenotypes using cosmid microinjection as well as experiments using RNAi. To dissect the gonad, nematodes were placed in a 40ul drop of 150mM KCI and 5mM HEPES solution and the heads were severed from the body by incision with an insulin needle directly behind the pharynx (as depicted in Figure 2.2). Hoescht stain 33258 (Invitrogen, SKU#H3569) was added to the liquid drop post dissection in a dark room and a cover slip was placed on the slide. Hoescht stain is used to visualize nuclei. Screening for the presence of 'spoon shaped' gonads employed .the Leica upright epifluorescent microscope with the A4 ultraviolet filter at 1Ox, 20x and 40x objectives.

3 Results

A genetic enhancer screen was conducted to identify mutants that enhanced the axon guidance defects of unc-5(e53), a putative null mutant lacking functional UNC-5. Three mutants were isolated, characterized and mapped on the genome (Sybingco, 2008). The three mutants were called rq1, rq2 and rq3. The mutant rq1 was determined to have mild enhancement of the axon guidance defects in an unc-5(e53) null mutant background and none in a wild-type background, at least in the DA and DB motor neurons (shown in Figure 1.11 and Sybingco, 2008). The rq1 mutation was mapped to a region on chromosome Ill in the interval between 2.126 to 3.963 as described in the Introduction (Sybingco, 2008). This region is spanned by eight cosmids. Figure 3.1 shows the arrangement of the overlapping cosmids/fosmids in the region.

As explained in the text, the only cosmid to demonstrate rescue upon injection was H04D03.

3.1 The 'Spoon Shaped' Gonad Phenotype

The candidate gene atx-2 was considered to be a strong candidate gene as described in the Introduction (1.11) as it was the only gene in the interval to which rq1 was mapped that exhibited the same type of embryonic lethality as that detected in rq1 (Sybingco 2008). Perusal of the literature indicated that when atx-2 was knocked out using RNA inhibition, the gonads had an unusual shape, similar to a spade or spoon when they were dissected out. (Ciosk et aL, 2004). Upon analysis of the rq1 mutant gonads, it was discovered that rq1; unc-5(e53); dpy-20(1282); {unc129::gfp+dpy-20] exhibited a 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype (Figure 3.2). The phenotype was also observed in rq 1 nematodes in a wild type background and an example is shown in Figure 3.2. The penetrance of the 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype in rq1; unc-5(e53); dpy20(e1282); [unc-129::gfp + dpy-20] is approximately 30o/o (N=69) while unc-5(e53); dpy20(e1282); [unc-129::gfp + dpy-20] exhibits less than 5o/o penetrance (N=58). The

obvious difference between the rq1 mutant and the background strains made this phenotype ideal for screening. This second phenotype was crucial as it provided a second quantifiable indicator of rescue through microinjection. The additional

phenotypes that are also present in the mutant, such as low brood size and high incidence of males, are not suitable as indicators of rescue.

3.2 Rescue Of Phenotypes By Cosmid/Fosmid Microinjection

The initial set up of the technique using only the co-injection marker, myo-2::yfp, was successful in creating transgenic animals. Although some gut fluorescence was observed, the YFP reporter provided an excellent indication that the microinjection technique had yielded transgenic animals. The GFP neuronal reporter was faintly visible through the YFP filter however the bleed through did not signi.ficantiy affect screening. The opposite is also true of YFP reporter through the GFP filter however it again did not affect screening. An example of a transgenic animal is shown in Figure 3.3. A total of five cosmids and fosmids were injected successfully and transgenic animals were screened for both axon guidance defects and 'spoon shaped' gonads. The microinjection technique does not yield high numbers of transgenic animals. Screening for two phenotypes is tedious and time consuming due to the fact that the animals rarely survive one screening process before being subjected to the second. Also, several of the cosmids/fosmids yielded extremely low numbers of transgenic animals leading us to hypothesize that a gene present on the cosmid/fosmid was either toxic or caused the coinjection marker to be silenced. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 summarize the microinjection experiments. The only construct that showed reproducible rescue of phenotypic defects was the cosmid H04003. The cosmid H04D03 was shown to rescue both the axon guidance defects as well as the 'spoon shaped' gonads in an unc-5(e53) background.

H04003 spans a genetic region from base pairs 10,451,006 which is a total of 21,082 base pairs in length. As a resultof microinjection alone, the region of rescue could be narrowed to five genes contained within the cosmid H04D03. These five genes are shown in Table 3.3. The results of the microinjection experiments also yielded useful negative results as shown in Figure 3.4 and 3.5. No rescue was observed upon injection of the cosmid 02045. The 02045 .cosmid overlaps with the H04D03 cosmid as shown in Figure 3.9. Microinjection of the fosmid WRM0638bE04 also yielded negative rescue results. The region of overlap between the fosmid WRM0638bE04 and the cosmid H04D03 is much larger and partially covers the gene H04D03.3 and entirely covers the geneH04D03.4. The WRM0638bE04 coverage of the H04003.3 gene does not include the genes promoter and only codes for the second and third of four exons. The success of the microinjection technique was variable, despite the positive results achieved using H04003. The technique proved to be difficult in that the ratio of the concentration of the reporter DNA to cosmid/fosmid DNA needed to be optimized for each injection despite the constant final DNA concentration remaining constant.

56

However, the fact that rescue of the axon guidance and the spoon shaped gonads were rescued by the H04D03 cosmid and not by several others in the region, meant that the gene mutated in rq1 must be on this cosmid.

3.2. RNAi Experiments to Phenocopy the Defects of rq1.

RNAi was used to attempt to phenocopy the 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype by knocking down genes known to be in the genetic region containing the rq1 mutation. There are 18 predicted genes in the interval where rq1 maps that are contained within the H04003 cosmid and these are listed in Table 3.4. The results of three screens are combined in Table 3.4. The screens were performed in two backgrounds; a wild type, N2, background and an UNC-5 null background unc-5(e53); dpy-20(e1282); {unc129::gfp + dpy-20] background.

One gene in the region of interest was unaccounted for in the library. H04D03.4 was not present and thus it could not be determined if a knockout of these genes causes a 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype. The H04D03.4 gene codes for a novel predicted protein which has similarity to zyg-11 which is known to be involved in embryonic anterior/posterior polarity (Vasudevan et aL, 2007).

3.3 Axon Guidance Defects in an unc..6 Null Background.

Recent experiments have been ongoing to determine whether or not the rq1 mutation is in a parallel pathway to the netrin pathway. A double mutant was created consisting of rq1 in an unc-6(ev400) putative null genetic background. A comparison between the number of DA and DB motor neurons that project axons in a dorsal direction was made between the unc-6(ev400) null strain and an rq1;unc-6 double mutant strain. The results are presented in Figure 3. 7.

4 Discussion

The novel mutant rq 1, originally isolated as an enhancer of the defects of unc5(53) Sybingco (2008) exhibits several well defined phenotypes in addition to

enhancement of the axon guidance defects. These include low brood size, high incidence of males and a 'spoon shaped' gonad. All of these additional phenotypes are seen to some degree in an rq1 mutant with an otherwise wild type background. Unfortunately the weakest phenotype detected was the one used to isolate the mutant, namely the enhancement of the axon guidance defects. No axon guidance defects have been detected to date in the DA and DB motor neurons in an rq1 mutant in an otherwise wild type background . This weak enhancement is probably due to redundancy in the pathways which guide motor neurons. Currently, investigations are underway to determine whether other neurons are affected in the mutant such as the VD and DO classes of motor neurons as well as the mechanosensory neurons or other motor neurons.

4.1 Microinjection

Microinjection with cosmid and fosmid DNA corresponding to the region where
rq1 maps was found to be successful. The technique was sensitive on a case to case

basis in that each cosmid/fosmid needed to be optimized for its ratio of reporter to cosmid/fosmid DNA concentration despite the final concentration remaining

approximately constant.

65

Despite the intricacy .of the technique, transgenic animals demonstrating rescue were quantified. As aresultof this rescue, the genetic region which H04003 spans must containthe gene mutated inthe rq1 strain. There are five genes in this region and they are: M03G11.8, H04D03.1, H04003.2, H04003.3 and H04D03.4. It is unknown which of these genes contains the rq 1 mutation so all of them must be treated as possible candidate genes.lnthe sections that follow each gene product will be discussed.

The protein M03C11.8 is a SNF2 family DNA-dependant ATPase. Although the entire coding region is not accounted for on the H04D03 cosmid it is possible that the

rq1 mutation is located in the region which is present on the cosmid. The promoter is
present on the H04D03 cosmid meaning a protein, however truncated, is being expressed as a result of the presence of the cosmid. The first 5,947bp of 7, 159bp of the genomic sequence is present on the cosmid which is approximately 83%. The full length protein is 989 amino acids in length and has nine exons. The H04D03 cosmid terminates near the end of the eighth exon and excludes the ninth exon. There are twenty four known alleles of M03C11.8 gene (genetic structure shown in Figure 4.1 ), however, despite the fact that the identity of the gene product is known, the protein is not well characterized. The domains and their functions have all been predicted through bioinformatics. There are three predicted domains. The first is a calcium binding EF-hand which is a highly conserved active site which binds Ca2+ ions (Moncrief et al., 1990). The second is a member of the DEAD domain family of proteins and is a SNF2 family domain which is a domain found in proteins involved in several processes including transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromatin unwinding (Eisen et al., 1995). The third domain is a conserved helicase domain which

66

is known to be involved in ATP binding, helicase activity and nucleic acid binding (pfam: PF00271). When aligning the eDNA sequences it becomes apparent that only the ninth exon is not present in the coding sequence covered by the H04D03 cosmid. BLAST alignment locates all three domains as possibly being contained within the region present on the H04D03 cosmid. Upon performing a BLAST search, using the protein sequence a homologous protein in humans with an E value of 4.2e-142 is obtained for a protein 83.5°/o matching in length. This gene is SMARCAD1. SMARCAD1 is a SNF2 ATP-dependant DNA helicase (Adra et al., 2000; Raabe et al., 2001) and is the closest well documented match to the C. elegans M03C11.8 gene. The genetic name SMARCAD1 is an acronym for SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin,

subfamily a, containing DEAD/H box 1. Mutations in SMARCAD1 are known to be involved in several diseases including tissue leiomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies (Adra et al., 2000). The protein itself localizes to the nucleus and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissue emphasizing its role in helicase activity (Adra et al., 2000). In C. elegans there have been several large scale RNAi experiments performed. One such demonstration published by the Vidal laboratory was demonstrating the adaptation of the RNAi technique to high throughput phenome mapping (Rual et al., 2004). In this screen the gene M03C11 .8 was identified as being embryonically lethal. Unfortunately this result conflicts with two, more recent, high throughput RNAi screens performed in C. elegans. In two separate screens performed in 2005 M03C11.8 was not identified in screens for embryonic lethality using high throughput RNAi technology (Fernandez et al., 2005; Sonnichsen et al., 2005). In our hands M03C11.8 caused the appearance of the 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype in unc-5(e53) but not in N2.

67

A mutation in the M03C11.8 gene could shed light upon why some of the phenotypes of rq1 are observed. DNA repair mechanisms such as that which M03C11.8 may be involved in are known to exhibit several reproducible phenotypes when they are defective. The phenotypes frequently observed as a result of DNA damage are apoptosis and a high incidence of males (O'Neil N. and Rose A., 2006), both of which are observed in rq 1. Despite the absence of nearly 20°/o of the genomic sequence the prediction that all three of the protein domains may be present makes it a valid candidate for the location of the rq1 mutation. The assignment of the protein as a SNF2 AlP-dependant DNA helicase with homology to the human protein SMARCAD1 makes its candidacy exciting since it can be tied to oncology and apoptosis. If the rq1 mutation is located within M03C11.8, the rq1 mutant in C. elegans may become a powerful research tool in many more fields beyond developmental neurology.

4.1.2 H04D03.1

The gene H04D03.1 encodes an unnamed protein. Very little is currently known about the protein aside from its existence. The entire gene is located within the H04D03 cosmid and, as previously stated, its removal does cause a 'spoon shaped' gonad

68

phenotype through RNAi experiments. The gene has three predicted exons and the protein is 204 amino acids in length (Figure 4.2). No phenotypes have been identified by high throughput RNAi screens nor have any alleles of H04D03.1 been identified. A footnote in the http://www.wormbase.org/ file for the H04D03.1 gene indicates that the gene is similar to a Saccharomyces cervisiae Global transcription factor. This would prove quite interesting. However exhaustive BLAST searches have not yielded any similar results. A pfam BLAST search did show weak homology to a membrane associating domain. The first thirty N-terminal amino acids show homology to a MARVEL domain with a high E value of 0.69. It is hypothesized that MARVEL domains could be involved in raft organization in membrane apposition events (Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2002). Although it is an unknown gene product, it would still be exciting if the rq1 mutation were contained within the H04D03.1 gene. The possibility of the protein being a member of a transcription factor complex could explain some of the phenotypes observed in the rq1 background since any pathway parallel to the netrin pathway could have a transcription factor involved.

It is required in several processes including germline development and vulval development (Couteau et al., 2002; Schott et al., 2006). The involvement in germline development could explain the embryonic lethality observed in the rq1 mutant. The HPL-2 protein has two distinct domains, the chromo domain (pfam: PF00385) and the chromo shadow (pfam: PF01939). The chromo domain involved in altering the structure of chromatin (Singh et al., 1991) while the chromo shadow is a specific second chromo domain found only in heterochromatin-binding proteins (Aasland and Stewart, 1995). The homology of H04003.2 to an important developmental protein such as HPL-2 is exciting if the rq1 mutation maps to the H04D03.2 gene.

4.1.4 H04D03.3

The gene H04D03.3 is an unnamed predicted gene. The gene product is predicted to be 409 amino acids in length and is predicted to have four exons. The protein predicted by the gene product of H04D03.3 has homology to the human ECM29 with an E value of 1.9e-12. The main functional repeat in the human protein ECM29 is a HEAT repeat (pfam: PF02985). The protein H04D03.3 has a HEAT repeat from amino acids 99-136. HEAT repeats are often present in protein phosphatases and act as protein-protein interaction sites (Groves et al., 1999). In fact, the gene product of H04D03.3 also has a phosphorylase domain from amino acid residues 339-370 (pfam:PF01 048). In particular the phosphorylase domain referenced is a purine nucleoside phosphorylase however there are target differences for the same domain between species so target predictions about H04D03.3 can not be made (Mao et al., 1997).

4.1.4 H04D03.4

The gene H04003.3 is a predicted, unnamed gene. The gene product is predicted to be 688 amino acids long coded for by eight exons. Some of this gene is also contained on the overlapping cosmid, 02045. The overlap with the 02045 cosmid is only 1OObp of the first exon so no information can be gleaned about this protein from microinjection experiments with the cosmid 02045. Although the coding sequence for the gene H04003.4 does approach the edge of the H04003 cosmid, the open reading frame for the gene is entirely present on the cosmid. The gene product of H04003.4 bears homology to the human protein ZYG-11 homologue B with an E value of 1.9e-6. Upon investigation the human ZYG-11 homologue B is named for its homology to the C. elegans protein ZYG-11. The C.
elegans protein ZYG-11 is a member of a CUL-2 complex (Vasudevan et al., 2007).

CUL-2 complexes are involved in many developmentally crucial processes such as successful completion of meiotic anaphase II, mitotic chromosome condensation and and anterior posterior polarity in the development of the embryo (Vasudevan et al., 2007). As previously mentioned in the section discussing the candidacy of M03C11.8 the

72

involvement of a peptide such as, in this case, the CUL-2 complex, could possibly explain some of the phenotypes observed in rq1 such as embryonic lethality and a high incidence of males (O'Neil N. and Rose A., 2006). If the rq1 mutation is found to be within the H04003.4 open reading frame it would be truly exciting.

4.1.5 Microinjection of Non-rescuing Cosmids/Fosmids

Microinjection experiments were performed using several cosmids/fosmids. Microinjecting cosmids/fosmids that do not exhibit rescue have the potential of providing conclusive results assuming the sequence of the cosmid/fosmid can be verified. Although the sequences of 02045 and WRM0638bE08 have not been verified, their results have still been presented . The 02045 cosmid contains the genomic coding sequence for ATX-2, a candidate protein for the rq1 mutation which upon, upon investigation, lead to the discovery of the 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype. When injected into nematodes strains with the rq1 mutation, no rescue is observed. This result effectively ruled out atx-2 as ·a gene within which the rq1 mutation may lie.

73

Upon observing.rescue of phenotypes from the injection of the cosmid H04D03, the experimental focus ·shifted to determining which gene present on the H04D03 cos mid was responsible for the observed rescue of phenotypes. Assuming the sequence of WRM0638bE04 can be verified as correct this result eliminates H04D03.4 as a candidate gene.

4.2 RNAi Screening

The feeding method of RNAi in C. elegans proved successful in phenocopying the 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype observed in the rq1 background. It also was suited to the relatively high throughput nature of the screening that was performed. The ease of the procedure made it simple to run the RNAi experiments in parallel with other experiments despite the lengthy amounts of quantification of phenotypes required. In total ten of the seventeen genes screened exhibited the 'spoon shaped' gonad phenotype in both the wild type background and the unc-5(e53) background. Although the number of genes exhibiting the phenotype was the same in both backgrounds, there were differences between the specific gene knockdowns causing the phenotype. The gene M03C11.4 exhibited 'spoon shaped' gonads in the unc-5(e53) background but not in the wild type background and M03C11.8 exhibited 'spoon shaped' gonads in the wild type background but not in the unc-5(e53) background. Due to the nature of the RNAi mechanism a negative result from an RNAi screen such as the c;>ne performed does not provide a conclusive result. In the case of a gene knocked down by RNAi which does not demonstrate the desired phenotype one can not assume that the absence of the gene does not cause the phenotype. Some tissues and proteins with long residence times demonstrate an observed immunity to knockdown by
74

RNAi as observed in the nervous systems resistance to the experimental technique. In other cases, such as the RNAi data previously described, the background can become vitally .important in the success of the technique. For this reason RNAi supersensitive strains have been created such as the eri-1 strain (Kennedy et al., 2004 ).

4.3 Comparison of Data Sets

The RNAi screening for 'spoon shaped' gonads was successful in that it provided information about the ability of a genetic knockdown to phenocopy the 'spoon shaped' gonads observed in the rq1 mutant The microinjection experiment to rescue the phenotypes of the rq1 mutant was also successful since rescue was demonstrated with the injection of the cosmid H04D03. Combining the two sets of data reveals that the observed phenotypes in rq1 could be the result of a mutation in one of two genes. These genes are M03C11.8, H04D03.1. The microinjection experiments revealed a possible five genes which could contain a mutation in the rq1 strain. These genes were H04D03. 1, H04D03.2, H04D03.3, H04D03.4 and M03C11.8. Microinjection has also potentially ruled out H04D03.4 as a candidate for containing the rq1 mutation. The RNAi experiments demonstrated that when H04D3.1 and M03C11.8 were knocked down, the nematode exhibited 'spoon shaped' gonads. When the genes H04003.2 and H04003.3 were knocked down the nematodes did not exhibit 'spoon shaped' gonads. Unfortunately one of the only genes which were missing from the library was also located on the H04D03 cosmid and thus the gene H04D03.4 could not be assayed for 'spoon shaped' gonads in the RNAi experiment.

DNA-dependant A TPase and has been confirmed by eDNA. The

H04D03.t gene has also been confirmed by eDNA however it is not characterized and the protein is classified as unknown. The preliminary data presented concerning the axon guidance defects in an unc6 null background supports the hypothesis that rq1 is in a parallel pathway. The data,

despite the relatively low N value, indicates a clear difference between the unc-6(ev400) null and the rq1; unc-6 (ev400) double mutant. In the event that the rq1 mutation caused a defect in a gene that is a member of the UNC-6/netrin pathway, no observed increase in axon guidance defects would be expected to be observed.

76

4.5 Reflections and future Directions

The overall goal of determining what gene is altered in the rq1 strain has the potential of being quite a lengthy process. In order to definitively prove the location of the mutation two genetic experiments have been performed. The reverse genetic approach through RNAi can yield strong positive results, however, negative results prove to be inconclusive. It is for this reason that both the forward and reverse genetic approaches must be taken together. The forward genetic approach of microinjection does provide a conclusive result assuming the sequence of the cosmid/fosmid can be positively verified. Rescue of phenotypes as a result of microinjection has conclusively demonstrated that the rq1 mutation is located within the genetic region covered by the H04D03 cosmid. Future experimentation to identify the precise location of the rq1 mutation in the region covered by the H04D03 cosmid is required. The H04D03 cosmid needs to be digested into fragments containing each of its five genes, the fragments need to be purified, and each gene microinjected independently to determine which gene will cause rescue of the phenotypes. Once the gene containing the rq1 mutation is identified, the gene must be sequenced to identify the true nature of the rq1 mutation. Depending on the gene identified, more experimentation will be required to understand how rq1 is involved in nervous system development. Double mutants need to be made between rq1 and other known axon guidance genes such as unc-129, unc-6 and unc-40, all involved in the netrin pathway. Double mutants with slt-1 and sax-3, known to be involved in the Slit pathway which plays a role in ventral guidance of axons also need to be made (Hao et al., 2001 ). Investigations into other axons besides the DA and DB classes in rq1 should be explored. Of particular

77

interest are the VD and DD classes of motor neuron which can be visualized us.ing unc47::gfp (Mcintire et aL, 1997) and the mechanosensory neurons which can be visualized

using mec-7::gfp (Savage et al., 1989). In the case that the rq1 mutation maps to a characterized protein or a protein with known conserved domains the experiments required to determine the effects of the mutation may be performed relatively readily. If the mutation maps to a gene such as H04D03J where extremely little is known, more intensive work may be required. No matter which gene the rq1 mutation maps to, several further experiments will be need to be performed. The timing and location of protein expression will need to be determined using the genes promoter to drive expression of a reporter gene. Another option is to make epitope-tagged versions of the gene to perform structure-function analysis. Finally, interacting partners can be investigated using such technologies as the yeast two hybrid method for identifying interacting partners of the rq1 gene product. Reflecting upon the data presented, the genes present on the H04D03 cosmid and the strong candidate genes can provide some explanations for some of the observed phenotypes in rq1. Of the genes for which at least some information can be attributed, it would be quite exciting if the rq1 mutation was found to be in M03C11.8, H04D03.2 or H04D03.4. M03C11.8 is identified as a SNF2 family DNA-dependant ATPase which is involved in DNA repair. Although no direct evidence can be found to correlate the observed axon guidance defects with a SN F2 family DNA-dependant ATPase there is evidence that a SNF2 protein is downregulated prior to apoptosis suggesting downregulation of SNF2 may be an upstream trigger of apoptosis (Raabe et al., 2001 ). Apoptosis events have been observed in rq1 strains and it could explain the observed embryonic lethality and possibly the high incidence of males as a result of defective DNA repair mechanisms (O'Neil N. and Rose A., 2006). A mutation in the H04D03.2 gene could partially explain the observed embryonic lethality. H04D03.2 has

78

homology to proteins which are known to be involved in germline development(Couteau et al., 2002; Schott et aL, 2006). H04D03.4 would also partially explain the observed embryonic lethality. H04D03.4 is similar to ZYG-11 which is a member of CUL-2 complexes which are involved in several crucial developmental events (Vasudevan et al., 2007). Defects in these developmental processes may also account for some of the observed phenotypes in rq1. Shedding light on a possible parallel pathway to the unc-6/netrin pathway would be instrumental to expanding our understanding of nervous system development. It is my hope that the gene mutated in rq1 is useful in many developmental and neurological studies far into the future.

79

5. Conclusion

Nervous system development is a complex series of events involving many as of yet not fully elucidated pathways. In order to better understand motor axon guidance mechanisms, a genetic enhancer screen was set up in the model organism C. elegans. A mutant, rq1, was identified as having increased axon guidance defects in an unc5(e53) background. This mutant was also found to exhibit a low brood size and 'spoon

shaped' gonads. Through the snip-SNP mapping technique the mutation was mapped to a 338Kb region on chromosome Ill between 2.126 and 3.963. In order to determine within which gene the rq1 mutation lies two genetic techniques were employed, RNAi screening was employed to phenocopy the defects of the rq1 mutant. In addition, rescue of the phenotypes of rq1 was shown through microinjection of cosmids corresponding to the region where rq1 had been previously mapped (Sybingco, 2008). Through these techniques the mutation has been mapped to one of five genes. From a combination of RNAi and microinjection results the best three candidate genes for containing the rq1 mutation are
M03C11.8~

H04D03.1 and H04D03.4.
