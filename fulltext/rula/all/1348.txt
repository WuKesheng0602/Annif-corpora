Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation
The human body is composed of trillions of cells, all working together in harmony. Occasionally cells will mutate and start multiplying uncontrollably, creating a dense mass of tissue. These cancerous tumours can obstruct or impede the natural processes of nearby organs and tissue. The cancer cells may also metastasize to other locations of the body, creating new areas of tumour growth. Cancer is the second highest cause of death behind heart disease and will account for over 600,000 deaths in the United States in 2009, or 0.2% of the population [3]. Early detection and treatment are critical to improving the survival rate from cancer.

imaging are either cost-prohibitive or invasive, a method to monitor the response of a tumour during treatment .over the course of several weeks is difficult to implement.

tumour response would potentially allow customization of the treatment to the individual patient. If the treatment is found to be ineffective, an alternate treatment could be formulated.

1.2 Cell Death
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a controlled method for cells to die with minimal disruption to surrounding tissue [9]. Apoptosis is used to maintain homeostasis in the body, to keep the number of cells relatively constant. A cell may mutate and lose the ability to undergo apoptosis, and grow out of control resulting in a tumour. Chemotherapy treatments concentrate on killing cancer cells and restoring homeostasis. The tumour will eventually shrink in response to the chemotherapy treatment. Apoptosis can be triggered when a cell is diseased or damaged, or through other signalling methods including hormones and toxins.

Necrosis is another type cell death, typically due acute injury [10]. Cell death from necrosis is uncontrolled and usually induces an inflammatory response by expelling the toxic intracellular contents into the surrounding tissue. A strong inflammatory response can lead to an increased morbidity and mortality, in contrast to the controlled method by apoptosis.

Clinical ultrasound ( l-15 MHz) is capable of deep penetration into the body, but lacks the ability to resolve fine details. Acoustic microscopy has excellent resolution, however, penetration depth is limited.

Figure 1-1 shows how the ultrasound resolution improves with increasing frequency [12]. As the frequency increases, the resolution increases but

depth. Penetration depth depends on the attenuation of the propagation medium, and the attenuation increases with frequency. Clinical ultrasound (1-15 MHz) is able to penetrate 515 em depending on the tissue type, and is ideal for deep body imaging, however it lacks

diagnostic imaging [11]. Ultrasound is non-invasive, low risk and inexpensive compared to resolution to detect fine details [13]. High frequency ultrasound (20-80 MHz) has good other imaging modalities, making it an ideal method of clinical imaging. Ultrasound could be resolution, but is unable to penetrate more than a few em into the body, making it useful only used to monitor the efficacy of a treatment, during the course of a treatment.

those in acoustic microscopy.

1.4 High Frequency Studies
Recent studies using high frequency ultrasound (20-60 MHz) observed an increase in the ultrasound backscatter intensity for cells treated with chemotherapeutic drugs to induce apoptosis compared to untreated cells, and also changes in the frequency dependence of the ultrasound scattering [14, 15, 114]. These studies used cell pellets created by centrifuging

cells into a dense arrangement of cells to mimic bulk tumour tissue. In one experiment, the cell pellet contained three layers; the middle layer was composed of cells treated and undergoing apoptosis, and untreated cells in the top and bottom layers. As shown in Figure 1-2, an increase in the ultrasound backscatter intensity was observed for the treated layer

with treated cells. In these studies, a cell pellet was created with cells treated to induce apoptosis in the middle, and untreated cells in the top and bottom layers (Duplicated from [2]).

1.5 Measuring the Properties of Cells
A key to understanding the observations with HF ultrasound is knowing the

compared to the untreated layers [ 1, 2]. In addition, clear delineation of the treated and properties of cells, such as the density, sound velocity, acoustic impedance, bulk modulus, untreated cell areas were observed. Note that at the frequencies used in these studies, and attenuation interact with ultrasound. These properties can change through various individual cells cannot be resolved. What is observed is the speckle pattern from sub-cellular physiological processes such as apoptosis, mitosis, locomotion, and adhesion [18] and how components. they change as a function of time through these processes is poorly understood.
It was hypothesized the structural changes within the apoptotic cells were responsible

Various techniques have been used to measure these mechanical properties, including for the increase in backscatter observed [16]. However the source of increased backscatter embedded particle tracking [19], laser tracking microrheology [20], magnetic twisting could also be due changes in the cellular spatial rearrangement [17]. The source of increased cytometry [21], micropipette aspiration [22], microneedles [23], optical [24] and magnetic backscatter intensity is unknown and cannot be determined using HF ultrasound alone. tweezers [25], and atomic force microscopy [26]. These techniques are invasive, requiring Additional studies must be performed to determine the source of increased backscatter. Critical to this is knowledge of cell properties at scales close to the wavelengths used such as

staining and/or a cellular response to an external stimulus [27].

While the above methods can be used to measure cells in a steady state, it can be difficult or impossible to measure cells during rapid processes, such as apoptosis and mitosis. Moreover, external stimuli can disturb the process, and therefore alter the natural physiological response of a cell. In addition, some techniques average the properties of the entire cell and are unable to restrict measurements to specific regions, such as the nucleus and organelles.

Early acoustic microscopes were able to create high contrast images dependent on the mechanical properties of cells, however, quantitative analysis was limited due to technology limitations. Different methods of measuring the mechanical properties of cells include the interference fringe method in which long ultrasound pulses were used, measuring the signal as a function of position (V(z)) or frequency (V(f)), and time resolved methods. The interference fringe method can be used to obtain the mechanical properties in a sample using narrowband pulse bursts. Waves reflected from the surface of a sample and the

1.6 Acoustic Microscopy
Acoustic microscopy was developed in the early 1970's by Lemons and Quate [28], and one of the earliest applications was to examine biological material using ultra-high frequencies (over 100 MHz) [29]. While unsuitable for bulk tissue investigations due to the large attenuation at higher frequencies, . acoustic microscopy has the resolution and capabilities to resolve individual cells and organelles as they undergo various biological processes [30]. It is non-invasive, and able to measure live cells without staining or fixation,

substrate will interfere, forming interference patterns on the sample image [3 3]. These fringes represent equal path lengths in the sample, and can be used to estimate the thickness, sound velocity and acoustic impedance in the sample. While these measurements can be done quickly, they suffer from poor resolution and the measurements are limited to regions showing visible fringe separation. In addition, this method assumes minimal variations in the density and composition of a cell, which is not always correct. The thickness, sound velocity and attenuation in endothelium cells of xenopus tadpole

a major advantage over other measurement techniques. The scattered ultrasound from hearts was calculated using the interference fringe method using a transducer at 1 GHz [34]. cellular microstructures would provide valuable information as to the source of the The sound velocity and attenuation measurements suffered from low precision, and backscatter within the cell, and help understand previous observations at high frequencies measurements were impossible around the nucleus.

These parameters can be used in computer modeling and simulations to help understand the apoptosis process and imaging of bulk tissue at high frequencies [31, 32].

Later techniques used V(z) methods, where the signal is measured as a function of axial position thorough the sample. This method requires images recorded at different focal
7

positions through the sample. Gathering enough images for a quantitative analysis is time consuming, and this method is generally reserved for measurements of fixed specimens only [12]. Measuring the signal as a function of frequency, known as V(f) curves, can also be used to determine the mechanical properties. The thickness, sound velocity and attenuation in a sample can be obtained by varying the frequency during a measurement [36]. Endothelium cells of xenopus tadpole hearts were characterized using V(f) curves to determine the thickness, sound velocity and attenuation [36]. The sound velocity ranged from 1.5 to 1. 7 m/s, and was generally higher around the nucleus. The attenuation ranged from 0.1 to 0.15 (no units given). This method has significant limitations, as the measurements are lengthy, requires both the phase and amplitude of the signal, and measurements at multiple frequencies [3 7]. Transducers are expensive and difficult to fabricate , and thus a small selection of transducers are available during experimentation which limits the frequency range available. Recent advancements in computers and technology enabled recording of the RF-pulse

Recent experiments using time resolved methods found the sound velocity of HeLa cells was 1550 m/s using 860 l\1Hz, and the attenuation to be 1737 dB/em [38]. In a separate study, HeLa cells were found to have a sound velocity of 1535 ± 34 m/s using 860 MHz [39]. A study measuring f-actin and cytosol in chicken cardiomyocyte using 1 GHz found a bulk modulus of 2.35-2.47 GPa and 2.25-2.28 GPa, respectively [40]. Acoustic microscopy using narrowband pulse bursts determined the attenuation increased for HeLa cells when they underwent apoptosis, however this was based on a qualitative assessment, no quantitative analysis ·was possible [41]. Biological examination presents some difficulty over isotropic and homogenous solids, as they are complex organisms made up of many components which can be time variant. In typical acoustic microscope systems, it is not possible to optically view the sample when measurements are made, therefore it is impossible to know exactly what has been imaged. The acoustic microscope used in this research has the capability of simultaneous optical and acoustic measurements, a distinct advantage over other microscope systems.

1. 7 Apoptosis
as a function of time at high sampling frequencies (GHz range). Short pulses combined with an increased signal to noise ratio (SNR) from post-processing methods allowed for time resolved measurements, where the backscatter echoes from the sample and substrate can be resolved separately. This is a significant advancement over other acoustic microscopy methods in that the mechanical properties such as the thickness, sound velocity, acoustic impedance, density, bulk modulus and attenuation can be directly obtained with a single measurement [3 7]. Cells are complex living organisms, and are the building blocks of multi-cellular organisms [115]. Human cells are typically 5-20 Jlm in diameter. The majority of the cell is composed of cytoplasm, and cells are 60-90% fluid [42]. The rest of the composition is made up of proteins and organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, vesicles, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and golgi apparatus [42]. Cancer cells are a collection of cells that continue dividing, disrupting normal

homeostasis [43]. These cells have mutated to lose the ability to undergo apoptosis. Left untreated, cancer cells will continue to duplicate, creating a large dense mass which may eventually disrupt normal body functions. Additionally, some cells may metastasize by breaking loose from the tumour and continue growing in a separate location. Inducing apoptosis in cancer cells is critical in chemotherapy treatments. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a controlled method of cellular disassembly designed to minimize disruption and damage to surrounding tissue [9, 44]. It is thought to be an integral part in the response of tumors to chemotherapeutic treatment [45, 46], but is also involved in other biological functions such as homeostasis [47, 48] , embryonic development [49] and lymphocyte development [50]. Deregulation of apoptosis is present in a variety of diseases, such as Alzhiemer' s and AIDS, and inhibition of apoptosis can result in autoimmune disorders and tumours [51]. Cancerous tumours grow due to a mutagenic ability that prevents apoptosis from occurring. Therefore the study of apoptosis is critical to understanding cancer growth and formulating treatments for this disease [52]. Cells undergo apoptosis in response to specific triggers such as physical damage, ionizing radiation, immune response, and chemotherapy [53-56]. There is a delay between the exposure to the trigger and observation of apoptotic processes, which is variable and depends on the trigger type, environment and cell type [57]. In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is a method of cell death that can be detrimental to

cellular contents into the surrounding area, causing an inflammatory response and disruption ofnormal biological activities [10]. The first stage of apoptosis involves the activation of caspases, proteins which digest structural proteins in the cytoplasm and DNA degradation [55]. Cell shrinkage occurs, and the nuclear material condenses. The chromatin becomes pyknotic and condenses against the nuclear membrane. The DNA material then fragments, and the nucleus breaks into separate bodies within the cell. Membrane blebbing of the cell occurs, which may contain nuclear material [58]. Eventually the apoptotic cell may break into apoptotic bodies, which can then be engulfed by phagocytes. The entire process of apoptosis can take place quickly, from first signs of bleb bing to removal of the apoptotic bodies in 30 minutes [1 0]. The early stages of apoptosis are reversible, allowing a cell to stop the process if the environmental conditions change [59]. Figure 1-3 shows a typical cell before and after morphological changes are observed during apoptosis. Detection of apoptosis 1n cell cultures is possible by labeling the cell with a fluorescent stain that binds to specific markers during various stages of apoptosis. A popular method of apoptosis detection is by labeling fragmented DNA with terminal

label DNA, however, it cannot be used to differentiate between apoptotic and necrotic cells unless used in conjunction with propidium iodide [50]. Another method of apoptosis detection is using Annexin V to label phosphatidylserine, a phosolipid that becomes exposed to the membrane during apoptosis and is a signal for phagocytosis [61].

resolved acoustic microscopy can be used to measure the mechanical properties of cells, such as the sound velocity, acoustic impedance, density, bulk modulus and attenuation during apoptosis. The goal is to determine how the properties change as the cells undergo apoptosis, which will give an indication of the structural changes that are occurring within the cell.

Figure 1-3: An optical image of a typical apoptotic cell before (left) and after (right) rounding up during apoptosis was observed. The cell on the left shows signs of membrane blebbing around the edge of the cell, a typical feature observed during apoptosis.

Current methods of apoptosis detection in bulk tissue include PET/SPECT [62-68], lipid proton MR spectroscopy [69-71], and diffusion weighted MRI [72-75]. These methods are invasive, require contrast enhancers or markers, radiation exposure and/or are expensive, which limit the number of tests that can be performed. Detection of apoptosis via ultrasound would provide an inexpensive and safe method of monitoring treatments. There are many stages in apoptosis; this research concentrates on measuring the properties before and after irreversible rounding up during apoptosis occurs, where the morphological changes are easily observable without staining (Figure 1-3).

1.8 Hypothesis and Objectives
The objectives of this research is to validate the acoustic microscopy technique by measuring the mechanical properties of a specimen with known properties, then use this technique to measure the properties of cells undergoing apoptosis. We hypothesize time 12 13

applied and is the ratio of the stress to the strain [77]. Stress is the force per area causing the deformation (typical units are GPa) and strain is the change in shape from the stress, in relation to the original shape. An object has many elastic moduli which depend on how and where the stress and strain are applied. Typical elastic moduli used to describe an object are the bulk modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear (S-wave) modulus, primary wave (P-wave) modulus and Lame's first parameter. The elastic constant C depend on the density p and the phase speed c through the object

For isotropic homogenous solids, only two elastic constants are required to describe all the elastic moduli due to symmetry; any elastic moduli can be derived from the two known parameters [77].

2.1.2 Scattering and Reflection
When ultrasound waves are incident on an interface between two materials, such as water and the membrane of a cell, a portion of the wave will be reflected from the cell, and a portion will be transmitted through it. Every material has a characteristic acoustic impedance

which defines the reflection and transmission properties [7 6]. The acoustic impedance is defined as the product of the density p and speed of sound c within that object,

Table 2-1: A summary of commonly used elastic moduli for isotropic, homogenous media. The equations for each elastic modulus are written in terms of the two elastic moduli easily measurable using ultrasound, the shear modulus C 44=p and the longitudinal (P-wave) modulus C 11 =M.

In fluids, shear waves are greatly attenuated and can be neglected. Therefore the shear modulus f.1 = 0. Consequently the bulk modulus can then be simplified to

and has units kg/m2s, or MRayls. For plane waves normally incident on an interface, the

reflected R and transmitted T components can be calculated using

Therefore if the speed of sound and density of a fluid is known, the bulk modulus can be easily determined. Since fluids cannot support shear waves, by definition the Young's 16

2-17 where Z2 and Z 1 are the acoustic impedances of the two materials at the interface [76]. For waves incident on an interface at a non-normal angle, Snell' s law can be used to determine the change in the sound velocity as a wave passes from one material into another. the waves will be refracted according to Snell ' s law sinB1 sinB2 where the subscript 0 denotes the coupling fluid, and the subscripts l and s denote the longitudinal and shear components in the solid substrate. Using these acoustic impedances, and conservation of the wave vector k at the fluid-boundary interface, the reflection and

These waves will be discussed further in section 2.1.6.

When a wave propagating in a fluid is incident on a solid, longitudinal and shear waves are created and must be accounted for in the wave analysis [80]. The velocity of longitudinal and shear waves are different, and therefore the acoustic impedance of these waves must be 18

2.1.3 Signal Measurement
Figure 2-1 shows a typical acoustic microscope system, with a transducer positioned so the ultrasound is focused onto the sample. The transducer consists of a piezoelectric 19

material and sapphire lens, as shown in Figure 2-1. The piezoelectric material will vibrate in response to an applied voltage, creating plane waves that travel down the buffer rod in the transducer. The plane waves are focused onto the sample by the spherical cavity. Waves from the sample and substrate are reflected back towards the transducer and are converted into plane waves by the cavity, which are then converted into a signal as a function of time by the piezoelectric material.

focus is below the sample. The signal s(t) received at the transducer is converted into a voltage by the piezoelectric, and is the total contribution of reflected waves from the sample at a distance z over the entire transducer aperture half-angle Bo. The waves will experience a distortion as they pass through the lens, from the lens into the coupling fluid and vice versa. The modified waves can be described by a pupil function, which defines the sensitivity of the lens as a function of aperture angle [82]. Lens distortions and aberrations may be accounted for in the pupil function [12]. It can be roughly

2.1.4 Time Resolved Quantitative Measurements

Time resolved acoustic microscopy uses short highly focused ultrasound pulses to determine the mechanical properties of a sample, including the thickness, sound velocity, acoustic impedance, density, bulk modulus and attenuation. The pulse echoes must be sufficiently short and separated in time for a quantitative analysis [12]. The quantitative methods discussed in this thesis require the time of the echoes from the top of the sample, t 1, the substrate- sample interface, t2 , and a reference measurement from the substrate, t0, measured beside the sample. A typical ultrasound backscatter signal measured from a sample 22

The signal as a function of z-position must then be measured over the region of interest to find the maximum amplitude of the ultrasound signal from the three interfaces; this technique is called a V(z) curve [85]. The transducer is positioned so the focus is below the sample, and . the signal is recorded as the transducer is moved up through the sample. The signal from an
23

interface will be maximized when the ultrasound focus is at that interface. The signal maxima from a V(z) curve of PVDF are A 1 (top of sample), A 2 (sample-substrate) and A 3 (reference) as shown in Figure 2-3.

From the measured acoustic impedance Z and speed of sound c, the sample density can then found using

2.1.5 Attenuation
For fluids that have viscous properties, the ultrasound wave will attenuate during propagation. The signal attenuation is due to scattering and absorption of the ultrasound wave as it travels through a medium. Water is typically used as a coupling fluid because it is 2-27 weakly attenuating, however at the frequencies used in acoustic microscopy, attenuation of the coupling fluid must be taken into consideration [12]. The attenuation can be accounted

Figure 2-3: A V(z) curve for 9 J.tm thick PVDF measured at 375 MHz. The maximum amplitudes from the top of the PVDF (At), PVDF-substrate interface (A 2) and a reference (A 3) are easily obtained.

The incident amplitude Ao can be determined [86] by using

where d relates the rate of compression to the viscous relaxation [12]. The equation of a damped harmonic wave 2-32 where a is the attenuation, is a solution to the modified wave equation. The attenuation is directly related to the frequency of the propagating wave according to the relation 2-33

where co and wo denote the reference sound velocity and frequency, respectively and n ranges from 0 to 3 [88]. Waves propagating in water experience no dispersion; the sound velocity does not change with frequency [89]. See Appendix A for details on why dispersion is negligible at the frequencies used in acoustic microscopy. However there is a strong quadratic dependence

where ao is the attenuation coefficient and n is a positive number [76]. For bulk tissue, n is typically between 1 and 2 [87]. The attenuation within the cell can be calculated if the cellsubstrate echo A2 can be measured and the attenuation ac in the coupling fluid through a distance 2d is known [12]. The attenuation within the cell is

of attenuation with frequency. In equation 2-36, n = 2 for longitudinal waves propagating in water. The attenuation also depends strongly on the temperature of the medium. The attenuation in units of dB/cm/MHz as a function of temperature in water for transducers ranging in frequencies from 200 to 1200 MHz are shown in Figure 2-4 [90]. At room

temperature, the attenuation at 200 MHz is 88 dB/em, however, at 1200 MHz the attenuation is 3165 dB/em. The attenuation decreases with temperature, and the attenuation at 1200 MHz is only 2220 dB/em at 37°C. The focal length of transducers used for acoustic microscopy are typically 50-500 J..Lm, with the shorter focal lengths used for the GHz lenses. Therefore the expected attenuation for a typical GHz transducer should be 20-30 dB in water, depending on . the temperature. While the attenuation is large, modern noise reduction methods and amplification techniques have increased the SNR to enable ultra-high frequency acoustic

Waves experience a change in the phase velocity as a function of frequency in most _ materials, which is called dispersion. Dispersion is due to absorption of the wave energy in the propagating medium; as the wave attenuates and loses energy, the phase velocity decreases [76]. The original Kramers-Kronig (KK) equation relates the phase velocity to the attenuation for electromagnetic .waves. This relation was developed into a form for 26

the sample) generating a Rayleigh wave traveling to the right which emits energy back to the transducer. A single ultrasound wave A travelling down the transducer is focused to focal spot B, below the sample. The Rayleigh wave C will propagate along the sample surface, emitting waves D, E and F back to the transducer. Not all waves will reach the piezo and be converted into a signal, only wave E is focused directly back to the piezo and will contribute towards the signal. If the signal 1s measured continuously as a function of transducer position, perpendicular to the sample (V(z) curve), the signal will be a maximum when the focus is at the sample-fluid interface. Oscillations in the recorded signal are observed, which are due to interference of waves emitted from the Rayleigh waves and reflected waves ·from the surface.
29

2.1.6 Rayleigh Waves
Rayleigh waves, or surface acoustic waves, are a superposition of shear and longitudinal waves that travel along a solid surface with the same phase velocity c. Rayleigh waves are slower than both a longitudinal or shear wave [12]. They re-emit energy back to the transducer as they propagate along the surface [91]. If the angle of incidence and emission are equal, the emitted wave will be focused by the lens back towards the transducer and contribute to the signal. Rayleigh waves can increase the contrast of acoustic imaging due to constructive and destructive interference with reflected waves from the sample, but can also create difficulties during a quantitative analysis [12].

where the subscripts 0 and R denote the sound velocity in coupling fluid and the Rayleigh wave. The generation of Rayleigh waves depend strongly on the aperture angle of the transducer and the elastic properties of the sample [81]. Transducers with narrow apertures will be less likely to generate Rayleigh waves, and low viscosity materials may be unable to produce measurable Rayleigh waves due to attenuation in the material.

A wide bandwidth is ideal for improving the axial resolution but requires very short pulses

[95]. However in practice cryogenic microscopy is not feasible for biological examination due to difficulties in operation and damage to biological samples. The depth of field describes the regions within a sample which can be focused and

which are difficult to create. The lateral resolution is limited by the Rayleigh criterion, which describes the minimum distance two objects must be spaced to be individually resolved. For standard light microscopes, the Rayleigh criterion is

resolved. The -3 dB depth of field is given by [93] 2-40 DOF where FL is the focal length and a is the aperture width [92]. However this criterion is an approximation. For acoustic microscopes, the Rayleigh criterion has a slightly better resolution limit, as the acoustic lens acts as both a transmitter and receiver in contrast to 32 The derivation of the elastic moduli are made on the assumption that the object is 33

2.3 Assumptions and Approximations

isotropic and homogeneous. This is true of many materials, however, cells are neither isotropic or homogeneous. Cells are complex organisms that are made up of irregularly spaced organelles and proteins with sizes ranging from nanometers to microns [42]. However an assumption was made that the cells are indeed isotropic and relatively homogeneous on the length scale that the measurements are made in this study, up to 4 J.tm at 375 MHz [96]. Acoustic microscopy uses highly focused transducers, and the assumptions in the time resolved calculations assume plane wave propagation. The waves can be approximated by plane waves at the focal region. Another assumption is the cells are primarily fluid, and therefore do not support shear waves. The penetration depth a of shear waves in Newtonian fluids is

structural properties of the cells [3 7]. The intensities used for acoustic microscopy are low enough that there is minimal disruption to the cell and the surroundings [ 12, 98]. Simulations using similar parameters as our microscope indicate minimal temperature increases at the focus [99]. In addition, the pulsed mode and rapid movement of the transducer during scanning ensures the ultrasound is never focused on one region of a cell for any length of time.

2-43

where 17 is the viscosity [97]. A quick calculation shows that at 1 MHz, the shear wave penetration depth is on the order of microns. At 1 GHz, the penetration depth is magnitudes less and therefore negligible, and we can neglect shear waves at acoustic microscopy frequencies. Ultrasound can influence the viscous properties of materials. The main component in cells is water, however some solid and visco-elastic components do exist, such as the proteins and some organelles. Due to the very high frequencies used in acoustic microscopy, the ultrasound waves will have a negligible influence on the viscosity of the cytoplasm elements [3 7]. Therefore the ultrasound interactions will depend on the elastic parameters and

in step sizes ranging from 0.1 J..tm to 2 J..tm in the x and y direction, to a maximum area of 100x100 J..tm. The piezo stage is capable of moving the tip within a precision of 0.05 J..tm in the x, y and z direction, with a range of 25 mm. The third module is used to control the ultrasound pulses. The module contains two monocycle pulse generators, one at 300 MHz with a 100% bandwidth and the other at 1 GHz with a 100% bandwidth with a 10 V pp amplitude. The pulse repetition rate is selectable but generally kept at 500 KHz to decrease the time of the measurements. The pulse generator used depends on the frequency of the transducer installed. The RF signal is recorded into memory during a scan using an Acqiris DC252 analog-digital converter capable of digitizing

Tests have shown the climate system is able to keep a stable temperature to within 0.02°C over a extended period of time. When operating at GHz frequencies, it is important to keep the temperature as constant as possible because changes in the sound velocity will affect the focus position of the transducer. See Appendix B for details on how the temperature fluctuations can affect the measured signal.

3.2 Transducers
A typical transducer is shown in Figure 3-6. A transducer is usually coupled to sapphire due to the high sound velocity (11500 m/s), low attenuation and robustness.
Figure 3-6: The three transducers used in this research. From left to right, 200 MHz, 375 MHz and

However the transmission power from sapphire to water is very low, due to the differences in the acoustic impedances (the acoustic impedance for sapphire is 44 MRayls, compared to 1.5 MRayls for water). A glass matching layer lf4 wavelength thick is typically used to increase the power transmission [12]. The focusing cavity is spherical in shape, with the aperture width and focal length chosen for optimum focusing. The buffer rod is typically made of sapphire not only due to its strength and robustness, but also due to the high index of refraction between the sapphire and water. The buffer rod reduces multiple reflections in the transducer and ensures the signal from the sample does not overlap the internal echoes [ 12].

The reference signal is measured adjacent to the cell, however the substrate is typically at a slight inclination. Therefore the tilt must be corrected for accurate quantitative calculations. By measuring the time of the echo from the comers of the substrate, the tilt can be corrected using a system of linear equation described in [39]. Some noise cannot be eliminated from the scans, and careful selection of the 47

3.3 Optical Microscopy
The microscope system is equipped with an advanced optical microscopy system with two light paths. Transmission optical microscopy can be used by rotating the optical condenser over the sample. This allows the option of using optical phase contrast, however, acoustic images cannot be used during transmission images as the acoustic tip is on the same rotating column. Reflection optical and fluorescence microscopy can be used by using a rear light source, with the light reflected from the sample or generated within the sample. It can be used while acoustic scans are in progress. This mode is also used to align the transducer to

MWG2).

The contrast of optical and acoustic imaging are very different. Contrast of optical imaging depends on the absorbance and reflectance of light with a sample. Cells are nearly transparent and have poor inherent contrast with standard light microscopy [1 00]. Acoustic imaging relies on the scattering of sound waves from the sample or their attenuation as they propagate through the sample, which depends strongly on the mechanical properties of the cell and the ultrasound wavelength used. Light path # 1 is desirable for high contrast resolution optical imaging. It can also use

regions of interest in the sample. a method called phase contrast, which enhances the contrast due to fluctuations in the phase The optical microscope has two imaging paths and several imaging modes. Figure 3-8 shows the microscope and the two light paths. Light path # 1 uses transmission light through the sample for viewing. It is used for sample imaging before and/ or after acoustic imaging. It Ideally the region of interest should be imaged with phase contrast prior to acoustic cannot be used during acoustic measurements as either the optical condenser or acoustic tip imaging. Reflection optical imaging can then be used to precisely align the transducer and can be above the sample at any one time. Light path #2 uses reflected light from the sample ensure measurements are recorded in the desired areas. and allows for sample imaging during acoustic scans. Fluorescence imaging can also be used with light path #2. A monochrome CCD camera (Lumenera, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) is attached to enable image capture and preview in real time at a maximum resolution of 1392x 1040 pixels, and a maximum frame rate of 15 frames per second (fps). 48 of the light as it travels through the sample.

to very thin thicknesses (< 9J.!m), which is ideal for ultra-high frequency measurements as it is sufficiently thin that the ultrasound won't be attenuated through the sample and is similar to the thickness of cells. Therefore PVDF a well suited material to test and validate the time resolved acoustic microscopy methodology. Figure 3-9 shows a schematic of the PVDF measurement setup. The PVDF is attached to a glass microscope slide, and the coupling fluid is deposited on the top. Adherent cell lines naturally adhere to the substrate they are grown on, however PVDF does not have any inherent adherent properties. It is important to minimize the gap between the PVD F material and the substrate, as this would introduce errors in the measurements due to the change in the amplitude and time of the ultrasound echoes from the substrate-PVDF

interface. Additionally, the presence of air at .the interface would introduce errors in the signal amplitude due to the strong scatter and attenuation of air pockets.

3.4 Instrument Calibration
The first step in this study was to calibrate and verify the quantitative methods with a known material before measuring specimens with unknown properties, such as cells. This section outlines the methodology verification using polyvinylidene fluoride.

3.4.1 Polyvinylidene fluoride Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a piezoelectric thermoplastic commonly used in transducer fabrication, first used in 1969 [ 101]. It has been studied extensively over the past thirty years, the mechanical properties of PVDF are well known. PVDF can be manufactured 50

Microscope slide

the PVDF had little effect, and using glue would add a non-negligible thickness and skew the results.lt was found simply pressing the PVDF material onto the glass substrate was sufficient for adherence. The PVDF adhered to the glass like cling-wrap. Optical observations showed the PVDF generally adhered flat to the substrate except in regions where dust, debris or air was trapped between the PDVF and glass. Interference fringes from light between the substrate and PVDF were observed around regions of poor adherence as demonstrated in Figure 3-10. Similar to interference observed with Newton's rings, the spacing of the fringes can be used to determine the gap thickness [1 02]. Large spacing between the fringes indicate a flat region, or where there is good adherence and m.inimal gap between the PVDF and substrate. Therefore measurements were chosen on areas where the spacing between the interference fringes was greatest. A piece of PVDF 3x3cm was used for these calibration studies. The PVDF material used had a large surface area in comparison to the size of the transducer, and it was observed that the center of the PVDF adhered optimally to the substrate, while the edges tended to curl away from the substrate. Therefore measurements were done on the center of the PVDF. A reference signal must be measured from the substrate for a quantitative analysis, however the transducer would have to be moved far from the PVDF measurement to measure the substrate. Inclination of the sample would introduce large errors in the measurement. To reduce errors, the reference measurement was simply measured by removing the PVDF from under the transducer and measuring the reference signal. This ensured the reference and PVDF measurements were made at the same height and position. Since the transducer was not moved during these measurements, the inclination of the sample could be neglected. 52 A quantitative analysis was done on a 9

The measurement was started with the transducer focus within the substrate, then moved up (positive z-direction) through the PVDF. The signal was recorded in 0.25 j.lm steps in the z-direction. The PVDF was removed, and the V(z) measurement repeated with the same measured parameters. 53

3.5 Biological Methods
MCF -7 breast cancer cells obtained from ATCC were cultured for this experiment. Cells were grown in 175 cm2 cell culture flasks (Sarstedt, Newton, NC, USA) using Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) cell culture medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% insulin. Cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% C02 and were passed every 3 days to maintain exponential growth.

Chapter 4 Results

4.1 PVDF Calibration Results
72 hours prior to experimentation, cells were dissociated using trypsin and transferred to Lab-Tek II chambers made of borosilicate glass (Nunc, Germany). After 48 hours of incubation to ensure proper adherence of the cells to the substrate, the medium was replaced with a solution consisting of the DMEM cell culture medium (without FBS or insulin), 3 mg/mL of caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich, Canada) and 20 ng/mL of Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Montreal, Canada) to induce apoptosis [103-105] , then the cells were incubated overnight (approximately 15 hours) prior to experimentation at 37°C with 5% C02. During experimentation, cells were kept at a constant temperature of 36°C with 5% C02· A common method to determine the nuclear region of a cell is to stain them with Hoechst 33342, a fluorescent dye which binds to DNA. When excited with ultraviolet light, the dye emits a blue light easily observable with fluorescence optical microscopy. Cells were stained to correlate the area of ultrasound backscatter to regions within the cell. Five measurements were done using the same method, with the PVDF and transducer repositioned for each measurement. The time of the echo at each z-position was used to calculate the thickness and speed of sound using equations 2-25 and 2-26. The acoustic impedance was then calculated by determining the maximum amplitude from the PVDF surface and substrate reference. Equations 2-29 and 2-30 were then used to calculate the density and bulk modulus. The attenuation was calculated using equation 2-34, and the attenuation in units dB/cm/MHz was calculated using equation 2-33 , assuming a linear 55 Before the · quantitative methodology outlined in this thesis can be used on cells it ' must first be verified using a known material, PVDF. A typical V(z) curve is shown in Figure 4-1 with the mechanical property measurements. The substrate reference maximum appears to be between the PVD F surface and glass-PVD F interface maxima. This is due to a change in the index of refraction through the PVDF material, as the speed of sound and density are different than the coupling fluid. This results in a tighter beam focus, which requires moving the transducer closer to the sample to reach the substrate. Therefore the substrate reference measurement appears to be higher (measured sooner) than the PVDF-substrate interface.

PVDF is a solid, therefore shear waves and Rayleigh waves could be produced in the sample which could affect the amplitude of the measured signal.

However a comparison of the measured values to accepted values showed good agreement, and it is unlikely that mode conversion has a strong effect on these measurements at 375 MHz.

acoustic impedance, density, bulk modulus and attenuation were calculated over areas of strong backscatter for untreated MCF-7 cells. Table 4-2 summarizes the calculations for four different MCF-7 cells measured at 375 MHz. This is the first time all these properties have been measured together using one method for the same non-fixed cell. The sound velocity measurements are in general agreement with published data using other cell lines, which measured a sound velocity of 59

For a quantitative analysis, a backscatter signal must be measurable from the region of interest. The amplitude must be sufficiently strong to accurately determine the time of the echo reflection. In addition, the echo from the cell and the substrate must be separated in time so there is no overlap. An example of a suitable backscatter signal from the center of a cell is

Using the method described in the previous section, the thickness, sound velocity, acoustic impedance, density, bulk modulus and attenuation were calculated at the center for treated MCF -7 cells before and after apoptosis. Seven treated cells that had not undergone apoptosis were measured (denoted unresponsive, Table 4-3), and five rounded-up cells (denoted responsive, Table 4-4). Between one and three measurements were made at each cell. The average and standard deviation of these values are summarized in Table 4-5.

calculated for apoptotic cells measured above the nuclear region was 653 ± 135 dB/em , compared to 405 ± 79 dB/em for unresponsive cells. Using equation 2-33, the frequency dependence was removed from the attenuation assuming n = 1. The attenuation after removing the frequency dependence was 1.74 ± 0.36 dB/cm/MHz, compared to 1.08 ± 0.21 dB/cm/MHz for unresponsive cells. The attenuation increased by 75% after apoptosis, despite the other mechanical properties measured remaining unchanged.

Acoustic images of MCF-7 cells were compared to optical images to examine the source of the ultrasound backscatter. Cells were stained with Hoechst 33342, which emits a blue fluorescence when bound to DNA, to delineate the nucleus. Optical fluorescence images and phase contrast images measured b~fore the acoustic scans were compared to the acoustic attenuation and backscatter images measured at 200 and 375 MHz, as shown in Figure 4-4. At 200 MHz, locations of strong backscatter are spatially coincident with locations of nuclear staining, suggesting that the scattering originates from this region. In addition, the signal from the cell anq substrate generally overlap, preventing a quantitative assessment at 200 MHz. At 375 MHz, the center of the cell generally remained the dominant scattering source.
4.2.4 Acoustic Measurements of Apoptotic Cells

MCF -7 ce'Ils were treated with Paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent to induce apoptosis. After 15 hours, these cells were measured using the 375 MHz and 1.2 GHz transducers before and after morphological changes were observed. Optical and ultrasound attenuation and backscatter images of typical cells in both stages measured at 375 MHz are shown in Figure 4-5.

Apoptotic cells were also imaged using the 1.2 GHz transducer and compared to optical images and acoustic measurements made at 375 MHz. Figure 4-8 shows a comparison of the acoustic attenuation images made using the 375 MHz and 1.2 GHz transducers. The 1.2 GHz transducer showed detail not resolved at lower frequencies. The nucleus and cytoplasm regions were clearly delineated, and the attenuation in regions containing the nucleus appeared to be higher than the cytoplasm. Additionally, protrusions from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and occasionally outside the cell were observed as shown in Figure 4-9. The backscatter was not reliably detected due to the low SNR, therefore a quantitative analysis was not possible at 1.2 GHz.

4.2.5 Acoustic Variations Over Time
Extensive activity within the cell was visually observed for a period of time after apoptosis. Figure 4-1 0 shows acoustic attenuation and backscatter images from an apoptotic cell measured one minute apart with the focus at the substrate, and frames from an optical movie captured at the same time as the acoustic data.

timescale of this measurement. The backscatter images however show variations with each measurement. The spatial patterns of backscatter and intensity variations indicate extensive activity occurring within the cell. This correlates to optical movies taken during the acoustic measurements, where membrane blebbing and other morphological changes were visible. The activity within a cell was measured by fixing the transducer over a single region and recording the signal every 10 seconds. The signals were measured before and after apoptosis for four cells in each state. The integrated backscatter intensity over the cellular region for each RF line were calculated and plotted as a function of time, as shown in Figure 4-11. To determine variations in the signal over time, the correlation coefficient of the RF signal from the cell was calculated for each cell by comparing the first RF signal measured to each subsequent RF signal for that cell. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates perfect correlation, or no variations in the signal. The correlation coefficient plotted as a function of time is shown in Figure 4-12. A summary of the average correlation coefficient, integrated intensity and maximum amplitude over the time period of the measurements are in Table 4-6, where the standard deviation indicates the variations within the measured values. In addition, the correlation coefficient, integrated intensity and maximum amplitude for each cell are shown in Table 4-7 for untreated cells and Table 4-8 for treated cells undergoing apoptosis.

The average correlation coefficient for unresponsive cells was 0.93 ± 0.05, compared to 0.68 ± 0.17 after apoptosis. The lower correlation coefficient and higher standard deviation indicate increased variations in the signal after apoptosis. In addition, the average integrated intensity was lower for apoptotic cells, at 0.57 ± 0.14 compared to 0.75 ± 0.10 for unresponsive cells. The maximum amplitude of the signal from the substrate did not show much variation, at 0.529 ± 0.003 V for apoptotic cells, compared to 0.498 ± 0.004 V for cells 69

Optical movies show morphological ·variations occur in apoptotic cells over a time period of seconds. The timeframe of acoustic measurements is too slow to show a sequence of activity within the cell at the time scale of seconds. We can only conclude variations in the backscatter were observed over the time period of minutes. Larger step sizes or lower scan 68

While there have been many studies examining the properties of bulk tissue, a lack of published data prevents a comparison of single cell properties where parameters used in the calculations have not been estimated. The properties of cells undergoing apoptosis were measured at 375 MHz using the time resolved acoustic microscopy technique, which is the first time the properties of cells undergoing this biological process have been measured. It was found the sound velocity,

While the theory for cells before and after apoptosis. After apoptosis, the thickness increased on average from time resolved methods are well established, technological barriers have prevented utilization 13.6 ± 3.1 J.lm to 17.3 ± 1.6 J.lm, and the attenuation increased from 1.08 ± 0.21 dB/cm/MHz of these methods until now. The combination of acoustic and optical components allows for to 1.74 ± 0.36 dB/cm/MHz.

There appears to be a clear delineation between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and extensive activity is occurring within the nucleus. The validation of the time resolved methods using PVDF, and measuring the mechanical properties of cells during apoptosis confirms that time resolved acoustic

decrease the spatial resolution, and allow for a more accurate determination of the mechanical properties of cells. With increased resolution and reduced errors, a difference in the mechanical properties may be observed before and after apoptosis. In addition, as clear delineation of the cytoplasm and nucleus was observed at 1.2 GHz but not at 375 MHz, measurements of the cytoplasm and nucleus with GHz frequencies would enable a quantitative assessment of how these areas change during treatment. Measurements can be performed on other cell lines during treatment, in particular acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, which have been studied extensively at high frequencies (20-60 MHz) previously in this laboratory. The methodology presented in this thesis can also be used for other time sensitive biological processes, such as mitosis, locomotion and exposure of cells to other types of chemotherapeutic agents. The penetrating nature of ultrasound would give insight into the structural changes occurring within the interior of the cell during these processes. Knowledge of the mechanical properties as a function of the state of the cell will allow modeling and simulations of ultrasound scattering from cells and cell .ensembles. These values are required as input to theoretical models of scattering currently being developed in our laboratory [32]. Very little work has been done on scattering from microspheres and microbubbles at the frequencies used in this work. Measuring the response of these materials at ultra-high frequencies using time resolved acoustic microscopy would increase our understanding of ultrasound scattering of micrometer-sized objects. The acoustic measurements can be

combined with optical observations of the microspheres and microbubbles to accurately determine how ultrasound scattering occurs as a function of object size and frequency. These results would aid numerical simulations and comparisons to theoretical models described above.

Appendix A: Dispersion in Water
The speed of sound in water was first measured by Jean-Daniel Colladon and Charles-Francois Sturm on a lake in Switzerland in 1826 [1 08]. Two boats a specific distance apart were used in the experiment. On one boat, a bell was rung in the water and gunpowder ignited at the same moment. Observers on the second boat recorded the time between seeing the flash from the gunpowder and hearing the bell, and consequently calculated the sound velocity in the water. Great strides have been made since in measuring the sound velocity in different media. There have been many studies showing the speed of sound is constant from 1-60 MHz and dispersion is negligible within this frequency range [109-111], however, there have not been any studies at GHz frequencies. It is unknown what effect dispersion has at such frequencies and it is important to know due to the high frequencies used in acoustic

Since water has a value of n=2, tan(n) = 0 and theoretically dispersion is absent. However the relation may not be exactly 2, so there may be a small dispersion effect that is unaccounted for. This small effect will be approximated using a theoretical estimation. The equation of a plane wave, accounting for viscous loss, can be written as

throughout this range, and attenuation is a requirement for dispersion, it follows that the speed of sound must be constant and dispersion is absent (or negligible) as a function of 78 The adjustment factor 79

is the modification to the speed of sound for the given parameters. We can use this equation to calculate the sound velocity adjustment factor as a function of frequency. At 37°C and a viscosity of 0.000692 kg/m/s, bulk viscosity of 0.001944 kg/m/s, and compressibility of 4.4 x 1o-to Pa was used to determine the adjustment factor for different frequencies. Additionally the assumption in equation A-4 holds true over the frequency range 1 to 1000 MHz.

The temperature has a direct effect on the sound velocity in water. An equation was

At 1000 MHz and 37°C, the adjustment factor is 0.002%, resulting in a speed of developed that describes how the velocity changes as a function of temperature T [112] sound adjustment of only 0.036 m/s. At 100 MHz, the speed of sound adjustment is 0.0004 m/s. The adjustment factor decreases with decreasing frequency, and at 10 MHz and below, the change in the speed of sound is negligible. From experimental work on attenuation, and theoretical calculations, we can conclude that dispersion has a negligible effect at the frequencies used in acoustic microscopy.

From 0 to 60°C, the speed of sound increases with increasing temperature, as shown in Figure B-1. The change in sound velocity will have a direct effect on the focus of the transducer. As the speed of sound changes, the position of the transducer must be moved to maintain the focus on the sample. The effect of temperature on focus position was examined by measuring V(z) curves from a glass substrate at 12 GHz as the temperature drifted slowly over a period of 30 minutes. It was assumed the temperature fluctuations were slow enough that the temperature of the coupling fluid and the air same.

Figure C-1 shows a transducer system measuring a sample with the path length of two waves, one through the rim and one through the lens, and the resulting RF signal. In Figure C-1, the main substrate echo and the rim echo are clearly observed. This second signal is not 85

from the focused ultrasound through the transducer lens, it is the substrate echo from the ultrasound passing through the rim of the transducer [ 113]. The artifact appears to be in front of the substrate echo, despite that the path length of the wave is the same through either the rim or the lens. The body of the transducer is made of sapphire, which has a sound velocity of 11150 m/s, compared to the coupling fluid, water, which has a sound velocity of 1500 m/s at room temperature [113]. During the path A-B, the wave travelling through the rim will be in sapphire, while the wave though the lens will be in water. Since the speed of sound is greater in sapphire than water, the echo from the substrate measured through the rim will appear to be ahead of the echo measured through the lens. This lens artifact echo is always a constant time in front of the main echo. It cannot be removed by a background subtraction. When a cell or object is placed onto the substrate to be measured, the echo must be sufficiently separated from the substrate echo to perform quantitative calculations, however, it must not overlap the rim echo. For cells with a thickness of 10-20 J.lm, this has not been an issue, however for anything thicker, subtraction of this rim echo must be considered.
