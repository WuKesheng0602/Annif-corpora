LITERATURE REVIEW

Although environmental refugees are part of everyday vocabulary and have been debated in academia for decades, officially, they do not exist. This review will cover
several literature fields (including refugees, environmental refugees, climate change, environrnentalism, and racism) in an attempt to uncover why they are still such a problematic and unrecognized category, whether or not they are a useful category, and, if so, for what and to whom.

are ready to take responsibility for environmental degradation, whether it takes the form of climate change, capitalist-driven development projects, or self-interested dumping or

exploitation. In contrast, other stakeholders have a vested interest in defining
environmental refugees, including environmentalists or forced migrants themselves
fleeing environmental degradation and seeking rights, recognition and protection.

Taking a political economy and political ecology approach, this paper deals with
many of the social, political, economic, and environmental tensions and inequalities

Theoretical Framework: From Political Economy to Political Ecology

A political economy framework questions the unequal distribution of power and wealth between stakeholders in a given situation. It originates from the ideas proposed by Adam Smith in his 1776 An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes ofthe Wealth ofNations, which argues that the self-interested actions of individuals in a capitalist system would advance the social welfare of a society better than state policy, as if they were guided by
an 'invisible hand'. However, a feminist political economy perspective states that "[t]he

between the developing and industrialized worlds1 while exploring the topic of environmental refugees. It does this through a literature review of related fields followed
by a case study on climate change in Tuvalu, which includes a media discourse analysis of the use of the term 'environmental refugee'. Through the literature reviews and

discourse analysis, it is shown that the term has different value, for a wide variety of
reasons, for each stakeholder in environmental refugee cases.

growing wealth-poverty gap calls into question the assertion that an unfettered market economy driven by economic rationality is inherently efficient in increasing productivity

1 There are several terms in use to make a necessary differentiation between countries' political and economic global statuses. Terms such as First and Third World are problematic and outdated. Other terms such as the global North and South are less offensive but due to this paper's occasional focus on Australia and New Zealand, are also less appropriate. The terms developed and developing countries provide a recognized dichotomy, however, I take issue with the implications of the terms.
The meaning of 'developed' - a sense of economic and social advancement and superiority - seems to

and contributing to everyone's benefit in society" and furthermore recognizes that "[t]he causes of poverty are embedded in the intersection of different inequalities in social
relations, such as racism, gender, homophobia, religious and cultural discrimination. At its core poverty is powerlessness" (Riley 2008: 2). A political economy framework allows one to question these concepts, processes, and interactions of power.

imply that these countries have completed the process of development and now stand as globally established pillars of success. From a political economy perspective, the exploitation and abuse of power inherent in many of the practices of these 'developed' countries calls into question exactly what has been developed and how. Especially from the political ecology framework that I also approach this paper from, which recognizes the importance of the environment and of sustainability, the capitalist and consumerist practices of these countries are far from 'developed'. In keeping with part of this established dichotomy, I choose to retain the use of 'developing' despite its similarly problematic nature, but I replace 'developed' with 'industrialized' to emphasize what has been developed in these countries, at great cost to the environment and to the rest of the world.

In cases of environmental refugees, a political economy framework questions the

facility with which certain capitalist stakeholders can, in their own self-interest, exploit
and degrade the environment and, consequently, people's livelihoods. These capitalist

is increasingly difficult in the face of greater political and economic power. In this sense, the environment is also a stakeholder, and its use and exploitation, as well its stability and potential to sustain livelihoods is central to the issue of environmental refugees.
Further stakeholders in environmental refugee cases are the activists and advocates implicated in each case through their support for refugee rights and for environmental
protection and sustainability.

overtly motivated by a desire to restrict asylum, the question remains as to why so much effort should have been spent in trying to separate environmental causes of migration from other political, economic or social causes, even to the point of trying to rewrite the definition of a refugee in international law. Arguably, the answer lies not in asylum literature or policy at all, but in environmentalist literature (2001: 12).

In these cases, there is still more at stake that needs to be considered: namely, the natural environment. The theoretical framework for this paper has therefore been

expanded to include a political ecology framework, which has its roots in political economy but also questions the role of the environment in political and economic exchanges. Political ecology, as Ariel Salleh describes, is similar to political economy but also encompasses the concept of an ecological debt to be repaid in any capitalist interaction involving nature (2009: 4). Just as capitalism depends on the unpaid
reproductive work of women, and on the exploitation of poor and racialized people and nations, it also depends on the environment and availability of natural resources (Salleh
2009: 7). While much is taken from nature, little is given back, and furthermore,
protecting the natural environment for smaller stakeholders such as subsistence farmers,

The environmentalist discourse, therefore, is an important one to look at in relation to environmental refugees. While some people in wealthier nations or individual

circumstances are disputing the legitimacy of environmental refugees or claims about climate change, presumably for economic, nationalist, or lifestyle reasons, those

advocating for the rights and recognition of environmental refugees are consistently also recommending environmentally sustainable shifts in consumption and lifestyles to mitigate the need for such a category in the first place (Conisbee & Simms 2003: 39;
Lambert 2002; McNamara 2008: 50-51; Myers 1997: 177; Nash 1999: 237; Salehyan

way to go" (2008: 41). While the term 'environmental refugee' may be a politically powerful tool for some stakeholders, it is not.perceived as such within UN refugee protection agencies.

In contrast, refugee protection agencies argue that attaching 'environmental' to 'refugee' does a disservice to their cause. The United Nations High Commissioner for

Finally, as in any case of migration, forced or voluntary, the other major

stakeholders are the nations who accept (or reject) migrants. Decisions on how to address
migrants can have to do with national, racial, ethnic or cultural identity and nations have power to include/exclude based on these or other political and economic factors.

Refugees (UNHCR) has consistently argued that environmental refugees should not fall
within their jurisdiction (Conisbee & Simms 2003; McNamara 2007, 2008; Misquitta 2008). This may have to do with the fear of not having enough resources to cope with this
potentially very large category, or the idea that those resources would be better spent

Conversely, migrants themselves are relatively powerless to affect those decisions unless
they are clearly recognized by international law (i.e. as refugees) or unless they can harness public, global support by, for instance, manipulating the political power of
language to invoke concern for moral or ethical responsibilities (i.e. environmental refugees). A basic push/pull theory can be applied to any migrant situation, as the decision to

elsewhere, or simply denial that environmental degradation is indeed a serious threat (Conisbee & Simms 2003: 26-7; McNamara 2007, 2008; PACE 2009: 13). In a series of
interviews, Elizabeth McNamara demonstrates the resistant attitudes within the United
Nations towards environmental refugees:

These people are certainly not refugees like political or religious refugees, they certainly are migrants, but most countries these days do not permit migrants who do not essentially contribute to the economic life of the country. You do not take in people because they can't make a living somewhere, so maybe there has to be a rethink of this whole concept before environmental refugees becomes a serious issue (McNamara 2007: 16).

migrate is "based on which place they deem more favorable" (Reuveny 2008: 2). Applying the push/pull migration theory to refugee situations, possible push factors might include "war, persecution, discrimination, and lack of democracy", while pull factors
may be "peace, family or brethren unification, preferential treatment, and democracy"

(Reuveny 2008: 2). While refugees are generally understood to have not had a choice in

The lack of recognition for this reason, though, does not take into account that most

A large part of the reason people resist recognizing environmental refugees and environmental degradation is because of what is at stake for them. Recognition would entail costly responsibility. For instance, climate change, as Angela Williams points out, is a controversial issue, which I discuss in further detail later in this paper, with environmental, social, economic and political ramifications (2008: 517). Human-induced
environmental degradation, such as industrial accidents or development projects, is fueled by capitalist production and consumption patterns (Timmons & Parks 2007).

environmentally-induced migration is indeed forced. When development projects and

other capitalist endeavours are put ahead of a community's well-being and that of their environment, their lack of political and economic power is apparent. Regardless of what they stand to lose, either economically, politically, or environmentally, their lack of power is easily taken advantage of because of their socio-economic position, which is
often related to race or ethnicity or some other marginalizing factor. Furthermore, the

same factors that diminish their power to protect themselves from environmental
degradation also make migration difficult, as they are often considered undesired or
unskilled immigrants.

Recognizing responsibility for environmental problems would necessitate allotting more economic resources towards mitigating those problems, and few states are willing to do so (Boon & Tra 2007: 91). In the name of consumerism, profit and power, many people and environmental resources have been heavily exploited. Both the political economy and political ecology frameworks question the justice of this unequal distribution of power to control livelihoods and environments among all the various stakeholders as well as the unequal distribution of adverse effects.

While policy-makers refuse to officially recognize this complex category, decades of academic debate from 1985 to the present have seen arguments for and against the recognition of environmental refugees coming from each of the various stakeholders. Globally, many people refuse to recognize their existence or predicament because doing so would implicitly mean that someone is responsible for them - either for generating
environmental refugees or for taking care of them. Self-interested consumerism

Defining Refugees

frequently requires the environmental degradation that leads to these refugees, while
accommodating them entails a national economic burden as well as possible acceptance

The internationally accepted definition of a refugee is set out in the United Nations 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 1 defines a refugee as any person who,

of environmental responsibility. Alan Nash, who feels that Canada should take a leading
role in addressing environmental refugees, points to the responsibility that Canada, like

other industrialized countries, bears in relation to climate change, and a history of
controlling migration (for racist or economic reasons) that would be challenged by an

climate, and with specific groups of people in mind, the Protocol was added so that the

original 1951 definition could be applied to any potential future refugee situation

Following this definition, the Convention "lays down the basic minimum standards for
the treatment of refugees" (UNHCR 2007: 5). These include, for instance, ensuring

(UNHCR 2007: 6). It was meant to allow flexibility of the original definition, to allow for refugee protection for those displaced by events unforeseen at the time of writing. With the passage of time, though, the definition laid out in both the Convention and Protocol
has once again become specifically and narrowly interpreted.

refugees' rights to freedom from discrimination, freedom to practice their religion, and rights to gainful employment and basic welfare; they also entail fair juridical and administrative expectations, including the right of host countries to refuse, detain or expel
refugees under exceptional circumstances and rights to naturalization for refugees
(UNHCR 2007: 18-38).

Canada, like most countries, has based its refugee law on the Convention definition.
In the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) a person who qualifies as a refugee is someone who:

As Jessica Cooper points out, the definition as laid out in the Convention is unlikely to ever change due to enormous international resistance as well as the fact that for
...by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race,
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country (IRPA 2001: 47).

decades countries have built their legal frameworks regarding refugee admissions and
acceptance around the 1951 definition (1998: 499-501). However, capturing what Cooper refers to as the 'spirit of the Convention' (1998: 528), the 1967 Protocol implies some
necessary flexibility with the original definition:

While this is evidently the same criteria as outlined in the Convention, the definition is still subject to individual interpretation by members of the Canadian Immigration and

has negative consequences or implications for forced migrants and refugees. Residents of New Orleans who were forced to flee the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster, although officially IDPs or evacuees, were frequently referred to as refugees by the media (Masquelier 2006). Refugee discourse in this situation, like in many others, was highly
racialized. The effect of this discourse was to further isolate an already vulnerable population: "[c]alling them refugees at a time when they more than ever needed to belong took away their citizenship, and by implication, their right to be part of the national order of things" (Masquelier 2006: 737).

Along similar lines, an historic decision by the Supreme Court in the Canada vs. Ward case, led to another ground breaking initiative: the definition of 'particular social
group' was broadened, in 1993, to include sexual orientation (Hurley 2007: 24; Supreme

Court 1993). No guideline or formal legislation exists to support this definition. So while the basic legal tenets of what constitutes a refugee remain consistent with the Convention,
individual variances and interpretations can and do exist, as the case in Canada proves.

Increasingly, groups and individuals are forced to flee such life-threatening situations as outlined in the Convention but do not cross an international border. These people are categorized as internally displaced, and are entitled to similar rights as refugees, but the governance of those rights and protections is not overseen by an

In the case of New Orleans, the use of the term refugee created an atmosphere of
exclusion, but it did not bring with it the rights and privileges of refugees. In the case of actual refugees, applying labels to designate sub-categories similarly attempts to exclude target groups from the rights and privileges of refugees (Zetter 2007). In his discussion of forming, transforming and politicizing refugee identities, Roger Zetter points out:

international body (UNESC 1998). Numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) have
grown steadily, prompting the United Nations to appoint a representative in 1992 "to

study the causes and consequences of internal displacement", which culminated in the United Nations Economic and Social Council drafting the Guiding Principles on Internal
Displacement in 1998, and leading many other organizations to "[broaden] their

planned asylum seeker), 'illegal asylum seekers', 'bogus asylum seekers',

mandates or scope of activities to address [IDPs] more effectively" (UNESC 1998: 2).
Globally, there are more IDPs than refugees today, and although the Principles promote

similar rights and protections as refugees for IDPs, because the governance of those rights is left up to individual nations, IDPs are increasingly subjugated and denied similar
rights and treatment as refugees (El-Bushra & Fish 2004; Ferris 2008).

Similarly, labels such as '"environmental refugees', 'tsunami refugees' and 'development
refugees' offer novel prefixes" (2007: 176) but as with all invented sub-categories, serve mainly to fracture the label 'refugee' (2007: 181). Juxtaposed with 'genuine refugees' these other 'types' of refugees are often de-legitimized in the public eye (Zetter 2007: 181).

Regardless of official, legal definitions, the label 'refugee' is popularly applied to

In the social and political climate of today's world, which is preoccupied with

'environmental refugees' I will return to the concept of labelling discussed here as it applies to all refugees. A refugee is clearly and consistently defined by the United Nations Convention, other advocacy organizations, and individual nations, but when the
term enters popular discourse, it is often misused, misinterpreted, and utilized to serve various stakeholder interests. In analyzing and understanding these various discourses on

elements of self-interest. The conflation of 'refugee' and 'economic migrant' has
frequently and deliberately been used to serve national interests (Zetter 2007: 182). As

'economic migrants', individuals are excluded from state protection and potentially also

excluded from immigration access, thus preventing both the financial burden of caring
for a refugee and the perceived hardships brought on by immigrants (i.e. strain on the
employment sector). Among other reasons cited to exclude refugees, "host nations are
inevitably suspicious that unworthy persons are wrongfully trying to claim refugee status

refugees, it is clearly important to question who is defining them, for what purpose, and
what benefits they might reap from such definitions or interpretations.

Defining Environmental Refugees

and reap the benefits their countries offer" (Cooper 1998: 501). By labelling refugees economic migrants (or otherwise), claims for asylum are de-legitimized and replaced with notions of immigrants coming to take advantage of a country's economic opportunities and generosity (Bauder 2008: 87). Although a majority of refugees are accommodated in developing countries, there is still a "myth that many citizens of the highly developed countries believe that their countries are the biggest hosts of the world's refugees" (Boon & Tra 2007: 92). Host nations are wary of the financial and environmental burdens (i.e. increased population pressures and competition for limited resources, especially in the developing world) as well as potential security risks that
refugees might impose (Cooper 1998; Myers 1993; Zetter 2007). There is also an element of racial exclusion when refugees are othered and unwanted because they are seen as not
belonging within the national identity (Zetter 2007: 180).

As suggested above, 'environmental refugee' is a constructed label with no real legal meaning - while it is a commonly used term, it is also highly contested. An abundance of literature on the topic creates, exemplifies, and attests to the confusion and
inconsistency surrounding environmental refugees, from their definition and scope to

their worthiness of protection. The term first appeared in the 1970s, "but entered
bureaucratic discourse in 1985" (McAdam 2009: 6). In a UN-sponsored report, El-Hinnawi outlined what would become the basis for future discussion of the concept (1985). He defines environmental refugees as:

...those people who have been forced to leave their traditional habitat,
temporarily or permanently, because of a marked environmental disruption

(natural and/or triggered by people) that jeopardized their existence and/or
seriously affected the quality of their life (El Hinnawi 1985: 4).

Labelling and defining refugees is an important, powerful and significant act that

Developing this definition, he offers three categories:

(1) "those who have been

and re-settled in a new area [because] of permanent changes, generally man-made [such
as] huge dams"; and (3) those "who migrate from their original habitat, temporarily or

environmental problems" (1993: 752). With this contribution, the definition became even broader still, since within this framework Myers himself acknowledged that it would be
"difficult to differentiate between refugees driven by environmental factors and those

permanently, to a new one within their own national boundaries, or abroad, in search of a better quality of life [because] the resource base in their original habitat has deteriorated
to such a degree that it can no longer meet their basic needs" (El-Hinnawi 1985: 4-5). While El-Hinnawi began the debate, Jodi Jacobson (1988) "moved the debate

driven by economic problems" (1993: 752). This is highly problematic because, as
mentioned above, the conflation of environmental refugees with economic migrants gives

nations more reasons to exclude migrants from their borders. The definitions laid out by El-Hinnawi, Jacobson, and Myers, are certainly not
without criticism. Their categories are seen by many as being "so broad as to be useless" (Suhrke 1993: 7). By allowing such a wide array of people to be defined as

forward by identifying major types of 'unnatural disasters'

and the associated

displacement of people, namely floods, droughts, toxification, deforestation and rising

sea levels" (Suhrke 1993: 6). Moreover, she "made no distinction between internally and
internationally displaced persons" thus broadening the definition even further (Suhrke 1993: 6). Citing examples such as the 1986 nuclear explosion near Chernobyl which permanently displaced 10,000 people, and the 1988 flooding in Bangladesh, exacerbated by deforestation, which left 25 million people homeless, Jacobson asserted that people fleeing environmental degradation had become "the largest class of refugees in the world" (1988: 257). From a refugee protection and immigration standpoint, this
broadened definition is problematic; nations will be unwilling to open their borders to such a wide array of people, especially if those people can receive adequate protection within their own borders. However, from an environmentalist standpoint, it might serve a stronger purpose of drawing attention to the persecutory nature of environmental destruction, which will be discussed in further detail later in this paper.

environmental refugees, it does, in fact, weaken the definition of a refugee as someone who legitimately needs protection from a life-threatening situation. Some believe the

acceptance of the link between environment and displacement was too uncritical or
simplistic, for instance, the assumption that environmental degradation would inevitably lead to forced migration or conflict (Black 2001; Lonergan 1998; McNamara 2007; Salehyan 2008). Because situations producing forced migrants are invariably complex, defining environmental reasons as the sole cause of migration is problematic; since the environmental factor cannot reasonably be separated from social, economic or political factors, such arguments have been described as weak (Black 2001; Lonergan 1998; Suhrke 1993). But, like the UN definition of refugees, the original intent and meaning of environmental refugees will inevitably change as new situations and knowledge come to

Norman Myers, also credited with laying the groundwork for the environmental
refugee debate, defined them as "people who can no longer gain a secure livelihood in their erstwhile homelands because of drought, soil erosion, desertification, and other

light. Based on the ever-changing literature, the definition can be seen as a work in progress, evolving to match current environmental situations and knowledge about
refugees.

There are some who still try to debunk the concept of environmental refugees
altogether. Black's Environmental Refugees: Myth or Reality? focuses, for the most part,

on challenging the concept, or "myth" of environmental degradation as being connected
to human activity or as leading to migration (2001). He focuses on "three categories of
supposed 'environmental refugees': those fleeing 'desertification'; those displaced (or

definitions to review in this paper, a brief overview of five types of environmental refugees follows. Each type entails different and unique environmental problems and consequences, some of which involve cross-border displacement, temporary or

potentially displaced) by sea level rise; and victims of 'environmental conflict'" (2001:
1). Focusing on the Sahel and other areas experiencing desertification, for example, he asserts that a tradition of migration in these regions debunks not only the link between

permanent displacement, and some of which are easier than others to attribute causality
and blame. The first type is development-induced displacement (DID), which is perhaps one of

environmental degradation and human activity, but also the very notion that the
environment is changing (Black 2001: 5). Like Black, Steve Lonergan also questions these categories (1998). Attempting to convey that environmental change is not a serious
threat, he states that land degradation, including desertification, deforestation,

the most obvious and acute forms of human-induced environmental damage forcing
migration. It is generally profit-driven degradation resulting from human control over

nature, entailing, for example, dam or mining projects, oil extraction, land tenure reforms,
or commercial logging, which provides economic gain for some, but at the expense of

salinization, and waterlogging, "is a gradual process, which allows for adaptation"

(Lonergan 1998: 11). While this may be so, and in fact many nations and communities
affected by climate change have adopted adaptive measures, this attitude is neither fair
nor realistic. Nonetheless, even at the international level, as seen in McNamara's (2007,
2008) research on the attitudes of high-ranking officials, ambassadors and diplomats at

Hugo 2008; Vandergeest et al. 2007). In the case of the Sardar Sarovar dam project along the Narmada River in India, for example, which will benefit a few (i.e. by providing power to industries and cities, and promising water for irrigation to drought-stricken regions), over 60% of people adversely affected will be indigenous (Bose 2007: 190). The Narmada dam project will consist of 30 large dams, 135 medium-size dams,

involved in any level of planning for construction or resettlement:

The second type to be discussed are those displaced by climatic changes, which are
most often gradual changes (desertification or sea level rise, for instance) but can be

acute (such as increased frequency and severity of tropical storms and other extreme weather events). Whether climate change is natural or anthropogenic (or happening at all) is a contentious topic. However, there are millions of people who are being forcibly displaced or whose livelihoods are being destroyed by violent, changing weather patterns

resulting in loss of livelihood, and economic, social, and political stability (Bose 2007;
Robinson 2003: 17).

Resettlement following DID is often persecutory. As the contributing authors to Development's Displacements point out, DID is both violent and coercive (Vandergeest

(IPCC II 2007; Myers 2001). This type will be discussed in further detail in the case

The ramifications of deforestation are many: soil erosion and consequent land
degradation and loss of habitat; exposed shorelines which are more vulnerable to the
effects of tropical storms (as compared to the Dominican Republic which shares the same small island); and unsustainable agricultural practices (Jacobson 1988: 257 Myers 2001: 610; Reuveny 2007: 664; Suhrke 1993: 7; Warner et al. 2008: 17). Although (like most

Deforestation and urban expansion have "eliminated natural processes that could have ameliorated the impact of Katrina" (Reuveny 2008: 8).

The fifth and final type of environmental refugee defined here is based on victims of environmental conflict, or conflicts in some way related to environmental resources or

The majority of all of these types of environmental migrants resettle within their
own national boundaries. Although the Convention definition does require cross-border movement, some authors have argued that this should not be necessary for environmental refugees (El-Hinnawi 1985; Jacobson 1988; Myers 2001). Agreeing with this proposed exception, Rafael Reuveny cleverly and creatively theorizes that:

environmental changes, although this category seems rather contrived. In Salehyan's words, "claims of environmental determinism leading seamlessly from climate change to open warfare are suspect" (2008: 317). Although conflicts do tend to produce refugees, and there are often factors related to the environment in the midst of a conflict, attaching the prefix 'environmental' to 'refugee' in this case is unnecessary and reveals an underlying motivation to draw more attention to the 'environmental' aspect of forced migrants than to the 'refugee' aspect (see: Black 2001; Salehyan 2008). According to Malthusian theory (1798), "population growth would lead to resource scarcity, economic decline, starvation, malady, and conflict" (Reuveny 2008: 3). Returning to this theory, Homer-Dixon (1999) proposed that (1) "environmental scarcity leads to simple scarcity
conflicts between States"; (2) "environmental scarcity causes large population movement, which in turn causes group-identity conflict"; and (3) "environmental scarcity causes

Environmental problems rarely follow political lines. What is being crossed by migrants is the 'environmental border,' where the degradation stops or the
disaster doesn't reach. This logic is in fact shared by all out-migrants.

Political refugees must cross political borders, usually of a nation. Those fleeing ethnic violence must cross ethnic borders, which may not follow
political boundaries... (Reuveny 2008: 2).

Regardless of where they settle and how it is defined, what is certain, is that
environmental changes do lead to migration. How these migrants should be dealt with is still an issue up for debate.

(Keane 2004: 219). Predicting or observing resource scarcities and resulting conflicts, has
led many authors to use this to build a case for environmental conflict refugees, citing

been done by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), for example (Cooper 1998: 496; PACE 2009: 19). The OAU's 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems follows the United Nations Convention and Protocol very closely throughout. It quotes the Convention's article 1 definition, but follows it with:

that the Convention should not be altered because it "would lead to a devaluation of the current protection for refugees" (Keane 2004: 215) or that the Convention is already fragile enough, given the current political climate which focuses on national security and keeping 'outsiders' out (McNamara 2008: 48; Zetter 2007: 180, 185). Others feel that, in
light of their unique status, environmental refugees should be addressed with their own
convention, set of treaties, environmental refugee status, or through bilateral agreements (Lambert 2002: 4; Misquitta 2008: 6; Williams 2008: 518). The focus here is on aspects of protection or compensation outside the current regime of international refugee rights. Another camp of activists agree that 'environmental refugees' are not recognized under the Convention, but advocate that the Convention should be expanded or modified to include them (Boon & Tra 2007; Conisbee & Simms 2003; Myers 1993, 1997, 2001; Nash 1999). The 1951 Convention was amended with the 1967 Protocol because it was

the term 'refugee' shall also apply to every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of origin or nationality (OAU 1969' article

This addendum is meant to accommodate additional refugees not recognized in the
present Convention, applying "the spirit of the Charter" in "the African context" (OAU

1969: 2). Environmental degradation, in this case, is recognized as a serious disturbance
that does lead to refugee situations, and therefore, does need to be addressed. Finally, some people will argue that the Convention does not need to be modified or expanded as it can already be interpreted to include environmental refugees. Cooper

recognized that "the scope of the Convention is limited to persons who became refugees
as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951" and that "[w]ith the passage of time and the emergence of new refugee situations, the need was increasingly felt to make provisions of the Convention applicable to such new refugees" (UNHCR 2007: 6). As Cooper argues, "[djenying people refugee status because they fail to meet the narrow definitional requirements established forty-six years ago is inconsistent with the spirit of

understood, making such actions deliberate and, therefore, persecutory when they adversely affect people's lives. Similarly, human inaction can also increase the impacts of
natural or industrial disasters (Cooper 1998; Masquelier 2006; Reuveny 2008). Furthermore, humans have the ability to control or change the environment, to a certain degree, through acts like deforestation or development projects. For instance, as

knowledge and power to ameliorate or avoid the situation causing migration, but in each case, they failed to act; a decision that was completely out of the hands of those affected.

In the Sahel, environmental conditions made people completely dependent on aid and in no position to implement or lobby for

Pablo Bose writes, dams "are, in a sense, monuments to the vision of industrialized

Returning to the concept of labels put forth by Zetter (2007), attaching prefixes such as 'environmental' to the category of 'refugee', may not be a useful strategy for
achieving the goal of protection. As Zetter argues, identifying different types of refugees serves to fracture and de-legitimize all refugees (2007: 181). In the case of environmental refugees, it has been argued that the term's "popularity is due to the fact that it allows governments to deny applicants refugee status" (Keane 2004: 218). This idea is echoed by Black, who felt that the seductiveness of the label was related to governments' ability to exclude asylum-seekers (2001: 11). As Zetter puts it, "[institutionalizing public

(Cooper 1998; Hugo 2008; Vandergeest et al. 2007). Within so-called developed

countries, like the United States, "it is the working class - and especially poorer people of
color and the most politically oppressed segments of America's underclass - who are being selectively victimized to the greatest extent by corporate environmental abuses" (Faber 2008: 16). Infliction of environmental abuse (or persecution) relates to reasons of ethno-racial and socio-economic status, because racially and economically marginalized
communities are less likely to be in a position to protect their rights and environment. Cooper's argument was put forth over a decade ago, but as several authors have

As McNamara suggests, the environmental refugee debate needs to take a new direction (2007: 14). Instead of advocating for the

rights and protection of specific groups, such as environmental refugees, it might be more
constructive to heed Zetter's advice and focus on "de-labelling" refugees (Zetter 2007: 190). In fact, the need for a sub-label often creates confusion in categorization. As it has

attention to be paid to the details of the case within the scope of this paper. Similarities between it and other cases of environmental persecution and migration can be drawn upon either for further research or in combination with arguments for a broader understanding of environmental refugees (or just refugees), thus resulting in better international protection for those who need it most. Therefore, to further address my research questions, I conduct a discourse analysis of the media surrounding prospective
environmental refugees in the Pacific island state of Tuvalu. The environmental degradation and ensuing migration from Tuvalu, which I

2001; Keane 2004: 221; McNamara 2007: 14; Reuveny 2008; 8). Furthermore, the social
treatment they encounter as refugees is indistinguishable from other refugees. Like

political refugees, if "[r]elief and protection is not delivered [...] refugees die or are
pushed back across the border" but "[o]nce uprooted, however, environmental refugees like most other refugees found that displacement meant dependency and marginalization"
(Suhrke 1993: 34).

Why then, if so-called 'environmental' refugees are treated similarly and very often

describe in more detail in the case study, are among the reasons it was chosen as a site for
study for this paper. The situation facing the people of Tuvalu fits the criteria set out by the scholars reviewed above for 'environmental refugees' (Boon & Tra 2007; Conisbee & Simms 2003; Cooper 1998; El-Hinnawi 1985; Jacobson 1988; Lambert 2002; McNamara 2007; McNamara & Gibson 2009; Myers 1993, 1997, 2001; Nash 1999; Reuveny 2007). First, there is a clear link between changing environmental factors and people's decisions to flee (see personal interviews in: Gemenne & Shen 2009; McNamara 2008; McNamara & Gibson 2009; Mortreux & Barnett 2009). Although this is true of many examples, even

when using the term does not particularly help the people affected, the question of why it is used becomes even more important. In certain circumstances, it does stretch the

definition of 'refugee', for instance with DID where forced migrants do not normally
cross political borders, or with climate change where the persecutory nature of the environmental degradation is in question. Within and outside of such circumstances, use
of the term is worthy of investigation.

analyze the problematic nature of the term 'environmental refugee' and to answer questions of why that is so, whether it is useful, and if so, how and to whom; By observing and understanding the way language is used to describe a topic - in this case, environmental refugees and claims of anthropogenic climate change in Tuvalu - one can see how, and for what purpose, it is constructed. According to Foucauldian theory,

Australia and New Zealand were chosen for their proximity to Tuvalu and as the prime
immigration destinations for fleeing Tuvaluans. The United States was chosen because,

along with Australia, it was the intended target of Tuvalu's threatened legal action against two of the world's worst polluters who had also refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. And
finally Canada was chosen to provide a sample of opinions on an international issue, but

"discourses help to produce the very categories, facts and objects that they claim to describe" (Tonkiss 2004: 373). Like Zetter describes, refugee discourse and the way
language is used to describe and label refugees, shapes perceptions of their legitimacy, as
well as the legitimacy of the right of nations to exclude them from protected status

as a country that was not directly implicated in the matter, either through the lawsuit or
the immediate threat of immigration. I focus on relevant articles from two major newspapers in each country. These include, from Australia, The Australian (TA) and The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), from New Zealand, The New Zealand Herald (NZH) and The Dominion Post (DP), from the United States, The New York Times (NYT) and The Washington Times (WT), and from Canada, The Globe and Mail (GM) and The National Post (NP). From Tuvalu, I look at articles published by Tuvalu Media Corporation (TMC), which draws on various news
sources from around the world to post on their website.

(2007). This study looks at language as "not simply a neutral medium for communicating
information or reporting on events, but a domain in which people's knowledge of the social world is actively shaped" (Tonkiss 2004: 373) thereby concluding how and why the term environmental refugees is useful from a political economy perspective.

A discourse analysis is useful and consistent with both a political economy and political ecology theoretical orientation because it can deconstruct the ways in which
'environmental refugees' are perceived by various stakeholders, as represented in the
media, to suit their agendas. This is important because media hold significant influence

An initial search of several newspapers from each country led me to narrow the focus down to two each. Reasoning for this was largely based on feasibility due to time

and space constraints. It was also based on topic coverage; some papers, such as USbased finance and business-oriented The Wall Street Journal, or Canadian city-based The Toronto Star, provided only minimal coverage. Finally the decision to narrow the focus to two papers per country was based on whether the papers had a wide enough readership

Because environmental refugees are of international concern, I have chosen four countries, in addition to Tuvalu, to provide a variety of international perspectives on what 'environmental refugee' means to various stakeholders represented in the print media.

necessary, into sub-groups based on whether the reasoning for the opinion was rooted in capitalist (C) or in racist or race-related (R) reasons. Based on these groupings, I then chose a few particularly illustrative quotes to represent the overall opinion in that category to include in the case study. From a political economy and ecology perspective, I used a discourse analysis method to analyze the meanings and implications of these opinions for the environment and environmental refugees.

both for environmental destruction and environmental refugees, and from a political
economy perspective, it is there that people have the most power to make changes that
would recognize, protect, and prevent environmental refugees.

Each newspaper chosen, with the exception of TMC which was small enough to browse, has a search engine which was used to find relevant articles. Newspaper archives (some of which required a subscription) were searched using the terms 'Tuvalu' with
'climate change', 'global warming', 'im/migration', 'economic migrants', 'environmental

refugees', 'refugees', 'lawsuit', and 'legal action'. Dates for articles and websites range from 2002, when the lawsuit was first proposed, because it represents a significant turning point in the quest for recognition of Tuvaluans as environmental refugees, to the summer of 2009, since, although the lawsuit did not materialize, the government and people of Tuvalu have not given up their struggle for recognition. Each article was then
quickly scanned for relevance and recorded in a bibliographic database.

environmentalist practices would mean that everything from individual consumption patterns to 'offshore' emissions would need to be altered (Nash 1999: 233; Roberts & Parks 2007). The discourse of denial is fueled by the likelihood that climate change is accelerated by human activity and that dealing with it would be costly.
In fact, denial of this is so strong that promoting similar economic growth in

However, questioning why there are attempts to shift the burden of responsibility
for climate change or debunk the concept altogether yields a variety of answers, and most

often related to self-interest. While establishing legal recognition of environmental
refugees may be beneficial to environmental migrants, countries wishing to restrict access to immigration, due to population pressures and xenophobic fears of the 'Other', are less anxious for such an action (McNamara 2007: 21; Reuveny 2008: 10; Zetter 2007: 180). The Australian government, for instance, has insisted that "there was no evidence to suggest Pacific island populations were in any imminent danger of being displaced by rising sea levels" (Williams 2008: 515). Similarly, the United Nations, which presumably does care about people affected by climate change, is limited by financial resources and by the international community as a whole. As one UN diplomat stated, "We have to
think of donor countries' priorities" (McNamara 2008: 37). Most important, denying climate change mitigates any need to take responsibility.

developing countries affected by climate change has been proposed as a solution. For example, Reuveny suggests stimulating "economic growth in LDCs [less developed
countries] in order to reduce their dependence on the environment and enable investment

in development and enforcement of environmental regulations and cleanup plans" (2008:
10). This does not take into account the fact everyone depends on a healthy environment (IPCC I 2007: 393-419; Kalkstein & Smoyer 1993; Salleh 2009). Nor does it

misguided solutions include population control and reduction in developing countries
(Hugo 2008: 41; Reuveny 2008: 10). Again, this sidesteps the issue of over-consumption in industrialized countries by misplacing the onus of responsibility on (albeit large)

Those charged with the worst contributions to global pollution, greenhouse gases, and

Overall, the obsession with profit over environmental sustainability has altered people's perceptions of climate change and who should actually be taking responsibility for it.

IPCC 12007; Conisbee & Simms 2003: 23; Nash 1999: 230). In 2002, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu threatened to take legal action against the United States and Australia for that very reason (Conisbee & Simms 2003: 14; Lambert 2002: 11; Renaud 2007: 20). According to an individual in Tuvalu: "The international community needs to do
something to help us. We're not responsible for climate change, so our country cannot

2008: 5; Warner et al. 2009: 18 Williams 2008: 505). In the past century, "sea level rose about 20 cm due to global warming-induced ice-pole melting" (Reuveny 2008: 8) and this rise is expected to continue (IPCC II 2007: 12). Adaptations to sea level rise, as seen
with the Thames Barrier in London, England, dikes in Amsterdam, Netherlands, or other innovations elsewhere in Europe that account for a possible one meter sea level rise, are complex and expensive, thus available to industrialized nations only (IPCC II 13-17; Tol et al. 2008: 433). Reuveny writes that "LDCs are less able to adapt to climate change than DCs [developed countries] since they are poorer, less advanced technologically, and most importantly, environment are for highly agricultural, than hence depend 9). much The more crucially on the of this

In the south Pacific, for instance, it is "the primary threat to the survival and sustainability of their homelands" (McNamara 2008: 43). Pacific

ambassadors are speaking up in the United Nations to draw attention to their disappearing

countries' plights, but remain frustrated "over the international community's general
denial of the seriousness of the impacts of climate change on these states" (McNamara 2008: 44). While many of the UN ambassadors interviewed by McNamara did not consider climate change to be a pressing issue, the attitude in the south Pacific is very
different. According to one:

observation is striking; not only are industrialized countries dependent on agricultural

imports from these areas, but the long-term environmental and human health impacts resulting from loss of habitat, trees, and air quality will be worldwide (see: IPCC I 2007: 393-419; Kalkstein & Smoyer 1993). Climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is an issue that affects us all.

above sea level, make it highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These include increasing extreme weather events, king tides, soil salinization, and above all, sea level rise (Connisbee & Simms 2003: 14; Gemenne & Shen 2009; Lambert 2002: 11;

(Gemenne 2008; Gemenne & Shen 2009; Mortreux & Barnett 2009: 108; Williams 2008;

McNamara 2008: 33; Mortreux & Barnett 2009: 105; Warner et al. 2009: 18; Williams 2008; 515-6). In fact, Tuvalu is projected to be one of the first nations to completely disappear under the sea, becoming uninhabitable by 2050 (Conisbee & Simms 2003: 2; Gemenne 2008: 161; Ivanov 2009:12; Lopez 2007: 372; McNamara 2008; Williams
2008: 515). Tuvalu also suffers other forms of land degradation from population pressures and a poor waste disposal system which is aggravated by an increasing reliance
on foreign imports due to the inability to harvest food in saltwater-soaked soil (Gemenne 2008: 160; Gemenne & Shen 2009: 9).

515). Furthermore, the Tuvaluan government has taken concrete actions, albeit not always successful ones, to ensure its population will have somewhere to go when the environmental degradation becomes too great (see media accounts and Conisbee &
Simms 2003: 14; Gupta 2007; Gemenne 2008; Gemenne & Shen 2009; Lambert 2002: 11; McNamara 2008: 45; Mortreux & Barnett 2009: 108; Renaud 2007: 20; Williams

2008; 515). For example, their government's actions have put their situation into the
international spotlight: first by making their tiny country more visible through seeking membership in the United Nations in 2000 and using that as a stage to voice their plight (McNamara 2008: 45), and next by threatening a lawsuit against the US and Australia in 2002 (Conisbee & Simms 2003: 14; Gupta 2007; Lambert 2002: 11; Renaud 2007: 20).

As one Pacific ambassador puts it, "We always feared that this was going to happen and now it is... Countries like Tuvalu and the Maldives are being threatened, seriously

threatened by rising sea levels" (McNamara 2008: 44). For instance, king tides, which
"come directly from beneath the ground, and penetrate it from below [...] used to occur once in every five or six years; they have now become annual, triggering the fears of some that they might eventually become permanent" (Gemenne & Shen 2009: 8).
Additionally, increased cyclones and hurricanes are evidence of a rising temperature, as

Although Tuvaluans have been aware of the effects of climate change and active in
attempting to secure their future for some time, the time frame for this case study will be defined by the threatened lawsuit, because it was significant marker of their case, to the

present, because their outspokenness at the United Nations and on the international stage
have not slowed since. Tuvalu's case presents and challenges many of the difficulties in addressing the increasingly frequent phenomenon of 'environmental refugees'. For one, migration

they are generated only when the ocean's surface temperature reaches 27° C, and "[sjeveral times during recent years the islands have been hit by severe hurricanes even though the most northern part of the island group lies outside the 'hurricane belt'"
(Gemenne & Shen 2009: 8-9).

drivers are complex, ranging from environmental to economic. Most individuals' decisions to leave Tuvalu have been because of the fear of environmental changes as well as the lack of economic opportunity found elsewhere (Gemenne & Shen 2009: 27;

Due to the increasing severity of these environmental factors and fear of what the

McNamara & Gibson 2009; Mortreux & Barnett 2009: 111; Warner 2009: 16). Like most situations of environmental migration, the environment cannot be fully separated from the political or economic. However, environmental reasons for leaving Tuvalu are much
more evident than in other similar situations.

Reluctance to leave is also related to the "fear that their cultural heritage might be lost"

(Gemenne 2008: 161), as well as the religious belief in the Noah's Ark story and God's promise not to flood the earth again (Gemenne & Shen 2009: 14; McAdam 2009: 25;
Mortreux & Barnett 2009: 109). Overall, most Tuvaluans are very resistant to the idea of migration and do not want to leave their home (Mortreux & Barnett 2009: 111). Any sea level rise-induced migration, therefore, should be considered forced.

For instance, in Bangladesh, where much of the country is threatened by climate
change and sea level rise, political and economic tensions also riddle the country. The

Unlike many other environmentally-induced migration situations, Tuvaluans will necessarily need to cross international borders, given their geographic position, giving
them more reason to be considered under the existing Convention for refugees. In cases of DID, such as the Narmada dam in India or the Three Gorges dam in China, or in cases of environmental disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans or the nuclear explosion in Chernobyl, migration occurs within national borders, where it is assumed that their own government will care for them. However, unlike those disasters, sea level rise is gradual, leaving ample time to negotiate migration, and consequently, less leverage as refugees. However, given the socio-economic barriers to migration, and the fact that Tuvaluans, like most people affected by these gradual climatic changes are poor, many would-be environmental

displacement of about 500,000 people each year as well as thousands of deaths, crop and

land losses, and soil and land degradation (Poncelet 2009; Warner et al. 2009: 13). Small
islands in the Bay of Bengal, home to approximately four million people, are being covered by the rising sea, as is the coastal region of the mainland, and people are being forced to migrate north, aggravating political, ethnic, and religious tensions as they move
(Podesta & Ogden 2007: 117). For most though, migration is simply not an option.

According to a Bangladeshi fisherman: "We can't do anything else, which is why we
think twice about migrating from here. We know the end is coming, but what work will

we find to feed our families elsewhere?" (Warner et al. 2009: 13). Like Bangladeshis, many people in Tuvalu are reluctant to relocate, in part because they have nowhere to go (Gemenne 2008: 155). Australia has refused to respond to any of Tuvalu's pleas for asylum, while New Zealand has extended an established migration scheme (i.e. unrelated to climate change) to allow 75 Tuvaluans per year to enter the

migrants 'choose' to stay where they are. Few Tuvaluans have had the opportunity or
resources to migrate.

emergency situation lacks foresight and amounts to persecution; because of their remote

geographic location in the middle of the Pacific, any type of emergency evacuation would
be utterly impossible (Gemenne & Shen 2009: 21).
A related guilt discourse also appeared frequently, attempting to use people's guilt for being responsible for climate change or environmental degradation to push them into

environmentalist action. For example, "One of the paradoxes of global warming is that

developing countries, which were not responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions that are changing the climate and did not reap the benefits of industrialization, will bear the brunt of the consequences" [NYT] (Byrayan & Raj an 2005), and "I find it astonishing that the U.S. still refuses to adopt serious measures to curb greenhouse gases"
[NYT] (Kristof 2006). Similarly, a guilt or pity (for others' plight) discourse was used to draw attention to the moral or ethical responsibility of industrialized countries to use their unequal share of wealth and power to help their less fortunate counterparts. For instance, "As the wealthiest country in the Pacific, Australia can lead the global community on this humanitarian issue" [TMC] ("Tuvalu Refugees" 2008), or "The Howard Government may prefer the ostrich approach to climate change, of keeping its head stuck in the ground, but Pacific island countries don't have that option" [TMC] ("Australia's Labor"
2006).

A newspaper search based on the terms set out in my methodology originally yielded 114 relevant results. I further narrowed this down to 42 articles that dealt

specifically with the concept of Tuvaluans as refugees or migrants due to climatic
changes. Each of these articles touched on a variety of themes including global warming or climate change, debunking environmentalist theories, economics, lifestyle, national composition, general immigration, fears of the 'Other', blame and guilt. According to the
coding set out in my methodology, the following is a representation of the various
discourses found in all the articles. All emphases in quotations are my own.

Articles presenting a pro-environmentalist agenda while discussing environmental

refugees or migrants were, by far, the most numerous. However, they took a wide variety
of approaches in conveying their environmentalist stance. Some adopted a blame

Beyond guilt and blame, environmentalist discourse also took on elements of fear self-interest. For example, the fear that climate change could also affect

degradation on industrialized countries, for example, with a tongue-in-cheek argument,

"my country is worried about maintaining its economic status and prosperity, that our coal is important because it powers China's factories and they produce consumer goods for Americans [and that] it is prudent that Australia moves slowly" [SMH] (Tanveer 2009), or more serious claims, attributing "the environmental degradation, deforestation and loss of wildlife and arable land [to the] seemingly inexorable need of the rich to
experience ever-increasing levels of conspicuous consumption" [TA] (Doherty 2007).

industrialized countries was expressed through comments such as "alarm bells were rung
as Australia experienced its hottest year on record" [DP & SMH] (Banham & Richard "Call an Island" 2006), or the fear that it is better to be safe than sorry: "Granted, there is

considerable uncertainty about the scale of the damage we are inflicting on the earth. But
that's no reason to play Russian roulette with our biosphere" [NYT] (Kristof 2006). Some articles played on concerns about in international reputation: "The Australian

2006). And finally on a self-interested fear of what industrialized countries stand to lose,

Matter-of-fact tones were frequently used to convey this agenda: "The moral of the story,
as Plimer says, is that 'a rise in sea level produces coral atolls. It does not destroy them.

These were followed, in terms of volume, by articles presenting arguments against climate change or environmentalism, as well as articles presenting anti-immigration

the authors' commentary: "Well, rather than rely on Brown's 'sense' of sea level rise,
let's check the instruments [which] show that Tuvalu has suffered, at worst, no sea level rise. So much for Brown's sense of sea level trends for Tuvalu" [TMC] (Baliunas & Soon 2002). Similarly, journalists employ ridiculing adjectives to attempt to debunk

attitudes. Those writing against environmentalist ideas did so using discourses of selfinterest, denial or matter-of-fact tones, and ridicule. Self-interest in this case, was usually
about preserving lifestyles, as adopting environmentalist agendas would entail significant

Europeans, the Toovies' complaint poses greater danger to the eco-fear industry than to

popular discourse. For example, "With such limited resources, the alarmism of western environmentalists will do nothing to help Tuvaluans. Only the scientific facts will" [TMC] (Baliunas & Soon 2002), or according to the Australian government, "There was

(Homer 2002).

"Accepting climate refugees from Pacific nations affected by rising sea levels was 'policy

on the run' that would add to Australia's already high greenhouse emissions" and that "Australia was the last place in the world that should take in climate refugees given its
high per capita emission rate" [TA] (Hodge "No Room" 2006).

Anti-immigration attitudes, in general, came up frequently in articles discussing environmentally-induced migration from Tuvalu. These attitudes had little to do with environmental factors and were more related to unwanted migrants. Headlines such as

While these are themes appearing in articles about environmental refugees, and it is therefore important to look at them, it is equally important to examine how the term itself
is used in the articles. Overall, 'environmental refugees' received slightly more negative press than supportive press. Some voices felt the term 'environmental refugee' was

"Pacific Migrants 'Drain on Economy'" [DP] (Ling 2008) and "Let Unskilled Workers
In, Australia Told" [SMH] (Banham "Unskilled Workers" 2006), conveyed this attitude. These capitalist or economically-motivated attitudes against allowing Tuvaluans into industrialized countries were further expressed in discussions on PAC, which New Zealand has been accused of not honouring: "Immigration Minister Paul Swain [...] said there would always be 'huge tension' in such immigration schemes, where countries like
New Zealand wanted the best migrants while poorer countries like Tuvalu would not want to give up their best people" [TMC] ("Tuvalu Premier" 2004). Even more than economics, race-related reasons were behind many voices discouraging immigration. These comments took many forms, for instance, in a story covering a "call for the National Party to rethink its race policies in view of the projected

"inappropriate" [DP] (Easton 2007) or "absurd" [SMH' & TMC] (Banham "Ministers
Unmoved" 2006). Furthermore, "This distinction between the obligation owed toward a

refugee in contrast to other people who are in trouble - even desperate trouble - is why
the terminology matters" [WT] (Stefanova 2009). Economically motivated concerns about environmental refugees were numerous. For example, "New Zealand could expect more demands to be placed on its aid programme" [DP] (Easton 2007). References were made to Australia's "endless

obligations to a new class of mendicants" [TA] (Pearson 2006). Providing assistance was

branded as "daylight madness. Our island neighbours may well have claims on our foreign aid, but as a matter of charity rather than any sort of entitlement" [TA] (Pearson
2006).

'browning' of the population" [NZH] (Collins 2005). This included details on a "discussion paper in 2002 proposing to scrap special immigration quotas for people from
Fiji, Tonga, Tuvalu and Kiribati" [NZH] (Collins 2005). Likewise, other stories reported

These represent more technical or capitalist reasons for excluding or debunking

on "Pacific Islanders' crime rates, poor education and low employment [which] are creating an underclass and a drain on the economy" [DP] (Ling 2008). Other voices
managed to connect racial exclusion to an environmentalist agenda, saying that

much larger populations, [...] I see no reason why a country such as Australia couldn't take small populations (of climate refugees) but you have to be careful you don't open
the doors for everybody" [TA] (Hodge "No Room" 2006).

Tuvaluans saying, for example, "If we lose our land we risk losing our identity" [TMC]
(Crouch 2008). Meanwhile, other voices assigned blame for Tuvalu's situation to

Tuvaluans themselves, saying "It is likely that the beach erosion and building on the
island caused the sea flooding of areas over the last decade. And that is a true environmental concern. But it is a local, man-made problem that will not be solved with
massive cuts in carbon dioxide emission" [TMC] (Baliunas & Soon 2002), thereby alleviating themselves of any responsibility. Others used Tuvalu's situation to boost their own self-image, for example, in the article "Aussies Help Stop Pacific Islands Going to
Waste", it asserted that although Tuvaluans were to blame, Australians had "the expertise to help" [TA] (Hodge "Aussies Help" 2005).

Articles promoting a positive reception to environmental refugees, many of which were published by TMC, included statements such as, "The National Council of Women

is concerned the government is being advised against allowing environmental refugees into the country" [TMC] ("Backing Environmental" 2007); "A number of people from Tuvalu have already emigrated to avoid being drowned by rising sea levels" [NP] (Taylor 2002); "Several islands have been lost to the sea in the past decade and there has been
widespread shoreline erosion and salt contamination of areas used to grow the staple root
crop pulaka" [TMC] (Crouch 2008); and "A rapidly warming planet may soon create a

new class of refugees -- those fleeing climate change in their homelands" [TMC] (MacanMarkar 2008). Playing on guilt and reputation, one article's response to the government's refusal to accept environmental refugees was to say, "More opportunities to recast ourselves as a responsible member of the international community are slipping through

the act of labelling someone a refugee has the strengths of "forming, transforming and politicizing an identity" (2007: 174). Jane MeAdam further argues that "the term seems to have been claimed as a politically powerful advocacy tool" (2009: 6). Within the proenvironmentalist discourse seen in the media, some of the methods of utilizing the
perceived political leverage derived from the term 'environmental refugee' were

questionably useful. Applying the label 'refugee' insinuates that persecution is taking place, and consequently lays blame. However, this blame is not often well-received and pushes people into a defensive state, which is demonstrated in much of the antienvironmentalist discourse in the media, for example, through the use of ridicule or through the sense of entitlement to unearned power and wealth as well to consumeristic
lifestyles that exploit an unequal share of the earth's resources.

Can it be pure coincidence that this is happening almost exclusively in poor,

racialized areas of the world? If one looks at industrialized nations, the answer is clearly no. Indigenous communities in Canada, who lack access to resources, decision-making
power and wealth, also lack access to clean water and proper sanitation, and are

frequently victims of environmental racism. For example, the Kashechewan First Nations

environment for their immediate profit, governments that allow them to do so in the name of power, and consumerist demands in the industrialized world for an increasingly elevated 'quality of life' that depends on environmentally destructive production and consumption practices, all play a role in environmental degradation throughout the world. Meanwhile, countries like Tuvalu and the Maldives or Bangladesh are disappearing under a warming, rising sea. In other pockets of the world, processes like desertification and deforestation are claiming lives and livelihoods as well as the natural environment.

Katrina affected mostly poor and racialized people, whose community had been established on land below sea level and vulnerable to environmental disaster, and who were unable to afford adequate protective measures against extreme weather, from levees to control the river to cars in which to flee (Bourne 2007; Reuveny 2008: 7-8).

environment is important in avoiding political or economic tensions arising from such

Environmental refugees pose a unique challenge to immigration law and policy.

With so many different stakeholders advocating for and against their recognition, it comes down to political and economic, as well as ecological power. The inequalities inherent in the current global system mean that the politically and economically powerful

The resistance of nations to accept environmental refugees, combined with the need of places like Tuvalu to have somewhere to go, demonstrates the urgency of recognizing this category of people in policy.

environmental refugees (i.e. as refugees, and environmental degradation as a tool of
persecution) could reverse some of the power dynamic by adding a persecutory stigma to environmental degradation. This would give more political sway to minor stakeholders and place more emphasis on protecting the environment, resulting in better environmental

Localized degradation, from development projects to toxic dumping to the loss of one tiny nation state under a rising sea, has chain reactions and far-reaching implications for the whole world. While political power and financial wealth will allow some people to adapt and avoid environmental dangers temporarily, this is a very short-sighted solution. The world's environment is changing, largely due to human activity, and it is
time that people begin to change with it.
