ABSTRACT
Fatigue Damage Assessment of Particle-Reinforced Metal Matrix Composite Materials under Uniaxial and Multiaxial Loading Conditions, Chris Sutton, Master of Applied Science Thesis in Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, 2009. The proposed study intended to investigate the fatigue damage of Particle Metal Matrix (PMM) composites under uniaxial and multiaxial loading conditions. Five damage models of SmithWatson-Topper (S.W.T), Ellyin, Brown-Miller, Fatemi-Socie and Varvani were tested for various PMM composite materials for their ability to correlate the uniaxial, torsional and combined tension-torsion damage-life data. Four PMM composite materials of Al6061 I Ah03 I 20p-T6, Al 6061 I Ah03 I 22p-T6, Al 6061 I SiC I 17w-T6 and Ti-6Al-4V I TiC I lOp were evaluated for damage-life based on their strain-life fatigue data. The results of the fatigue

damage correlation of uniaxial, torsional and combined tension-torsion fatigue damage versus life for the four PMM composites were investigated in this thesis. The critical plane approaches of Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie should almost have the same degree of success in damage assessment of composite materials. These strain based critical plane approaches scaled damage values versus fatigue life data as the lowest range (0.001-0.01) over low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue regimes. While energy based models of S.W.T and Ellyin holding both the stress and strain terms correlated damage data at the highest range (1-1 0) with a relatively larger scatter band for various fatigue lives as compared with other damage approaches. Varvani critical plane-energy approach incorporated the critical plane as the plane of crack initiation and damage growth as well as the strain energy density as a function of stress and strain components acting on the critical plane, which successfully evaluated fatigue damage values within a narrow band. Damage values based on this approach ranged between the highest (S.W.T and Ellyin) and the lowest (Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie) ranges and presented an intermediate range of (0.05VI

0.1 ). Varvani damage model was further enhanced by means of material dependent terms of a and

p to

account for the magnitude of difference between Coffin-Manson coefficients for the

metallic matrix and PMMC. Terms a and~ enables to estimate fatigue damage ofPMMCs if the strain-life curve for the base metal matrix is known. A finite element unit cell model was also developed to simulate stress-strain responses of Al 6061 I Ah03 I 1Op-T6 and Al 6061 I Ah03 I 20p-T6 under monotonic tensile loading. The simulated numerical results of stress-strain

showed good agreement with the experimental data and prove to be a good tool in the estimation of stress-strain behaviour of PMM composites with various volume fractions.

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF THE THESIS

Particle Metal Matrix composites (PMMCs) have been extensively investigated since 1980 for applications where light weight structures with high strength and fatigue resistance were required. Currently very little published fatigue data are available in the literature and studies that examine the capabilities of earlier developed fatigue damage models for discontinuous particle metal matrix composites. A crucial objective of the current thesis is to examine the fatigue damage response of PMM composites and discuss the capability of damage models incorporating phenomenological parameters of reinforced particle volume fraction, mean stress effect, strain hardening and material properties of the base metallic matrix and reinforced particles in PMMCs. The fatigue damage assessment of the discontinuous PMM composites investigated in this study were evaluated based on the Smith-Watson-Topper (S.W.T), Ellyin, Brown-Miller, Fatemi-Socie and Varvani damage approaches. Fatigue stress-life data of various uniaxial and multiaxial

loading for PMM composites of AI 6061 I Ah03 I 20p-T6, AI 6061 I Ah03 I 22p-T6, AI 6061 I SiC I 17w-T6 and Ti-6Al-4V I TiC I 1Op were extracted from literature to evaluate fatigue damage models and to further enhance a damage model taking into account the related phenomenological parameters. Considering material dependent parameters of a and f3 in Varvani damage, the model enabled damage assessment of PMM composite materials. This makes a direct damage assessment of PMMCs by having strain-life Coffin-Manson coefficients for the metallic matrix.

To better understand the effect of volume fraction with a PMM composite, a finite element unit cell models was generated with Solidworks 2005 and evaluated using Ansys Workbench 11 for the stress-strain behaviour response of Al 6061 I Ah03 composites under monotonic tensile loading. The results obtained from numerical simulation help to approximate the tensile stressstrain behaviour of these composites for various particle fractions.

PREFACE
The following provides a brief description of material covered in the chapters of this thesis. Chapter 1 reveals the history of composites and the origins of modem day metal matrix composites. Particle-reinforced metal matrix composites are introduced along with their tensile and fatigue behaviour. Chapter 2 presents the PMM composite constitutive equations of stress, strain and the stressstrain relations of elastic, plastic and strain energy. Chapter 3 simulates the stress-strain response of PMM composites using a unit cell finite element model. Simulated stress-strain response under monotonic loading is compared with experimental data of the same material reported in literature. Chapter 4 presents fatigue damage models of Smith-Watson-Topper, Ellyin, Brown-Miller, Fatemi-Socie and Varvani and discusses their terms and capabilities in assessing fatigue damage under various loading conditions. S.W.T and Ellyin are energy based approaches while BrownMiller and Fatemi-Socie are strain-based critical plane approaches. Varvani' s damage model incorporates the critical plane of crack and energy resulting from stress and strain components acting on the critical plane. Chapter 5 discusses the parameters of damage assessment for PMM composites, which include crack initiation and growth, and the effects of particle size, volume fraction and heat treatment. Results of damage assessment based on S.W.T, Ellyin, Brown-Miller, and Fatemi-Socie approaches for various PMM composite materials tested under various loading conditions are presented.

in Varvani critical plane-energy

approach to account for the effects of shear and normal fatigue properties in the damage model. Results for the damage assessment of the modified Varvani model with the various PMM composites are included. Chapter 7 compares and discusses the capabilities of the fatigue damage models with Varvani' s approach for various PMM composites tested under uniaxial and multiaxialloading conditions. Results of stress-strain simulated using an FE unit cell model are compared with experimentally obtained values of stress-strain data for AI 6061 I Ab03. The effect of particle volume fraction on fatigue damage of Al 6061 I Ab03 I 20p-T6 and AI 6061 I Ab03 I 22p-T6 under uniaxial and torsional fatigue loading is discussed. These damage-life curves are evaluated based on damage approaches discussed in this thesis. Chapter 8 summarizes the conclusions achieved from this study. This chapter brings attention to the applicability of various fatigue damage models in assessing damage for PMM composites under various loading conditions and recommends some research investigation on fatigue of PMMCs as a future outlook. Appendix A at the end of this thesis lists composite material data including material properties, fatigue S-N data tested under various loading conditions, and results of damage analysis based on various damage models.

Introduction
1.1. Composites-Historical Review
Man has always been intrigued with the ability to innovate something better, and the area of material engineering is a perfect example of man's ability to manipulate naturally occurring materials to desired specifications. Engineering materials can date back to the time of the

Egyptians, Mayans, and Incans. During this time evidence has shown that standard clay was mixed with plant fibres or straw to make bricks and other pottery stronger. The modem history of composite materials began in 1930 with the development of fibreglass. The fibreglass was actually developed by accident while an engineer became interested in a type of fibre that was forming while he was applying lettering to a glass bottle. This new finely drawn glass was initially produced as insulations with structural applications soon to follow. The development of composite materials for both structural and semi-structural parts was accelerated during WWII because of the increase in aircraft production, and also in the area of tooling. One of the first major production parts of composite materials on aircraft were the air supply ducts. Since the ducts were the last system to be installed, they frequently had to bend and twist around other fixed systems. Since metal ducts were difficult to engineer into these variable shapes, fibre-resin composites seemed to be the logical choice [ 1]. As WWII accelerated the applications of fibreresin composites, the end of the war saw the adaption of composite materials into many more commercial applications. Boat hauls in the late 1940's had been engineered with fibreglass materials, and in 1953 Chevrolet manufactured the frrst ever all fibreglass body car; the Corvette.

1

As time continued to march forward, more and more commercial applications involving composite materials were being produced as the manufacturing methods of these composites were being refined to reduce costs. The 1960's and 1970's brought forth a significant leap in composite materials with the development of carbon fibres, boron filaments, and aramid fibres (Kevlar®). These new fibre reinforcements provided a much higher strength than previous glass fibres. The development of Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) in the 1970s emerged in response to the need for new materials to fulfill the capabilities of advanced designs within the military sector [2]. This initial phase of MMC research and design at this time in history provided an improved affordability of the technology as well as a large amount of engineering data and results of the capabilities of these new materials. By the late 1970s, demand for affordability and safety of research with MMC materials started to slow production of MMC materials, even within the military sector. These heightened expectations of MMCs made it difficult for producers to certify these materials for different applications [3]. Also during this time, advanced military projects were decreasing as countries were switching from active military projects to a more conservative strategy of extending the life to existing systems. This stance to conserve military spending on new projects made the development of high performance materials such as MMCs very difficult to move forward. The 1980s saw a rejuvenation of MMC research and design. The reason for this revitalization was mainly due to the development of discontinuously reinforced MMCs. Even though

discontinuously reinforced MMCs provided inferior mechanical properties to continuously reinforced MMCs, what they provided to industry was an improved affordability and ease of processing. These two main improvements made it possible for MMCs to find a place in the
2

commercial markets. The main efforts of research and design for discontinuously reinforced MMCs focused on the right balance between performance, cost, and risk acceptability.

1.2. Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs)
There has been plenty of research that shows that the inclusion of ceramic particles or whiskers, whether continuously or discontinuously (see figure 1.1) in a metallic matrix leads to improved properties of stiffness, strength, wear, and creep resistance. The reasoning behind MMCs is that they take the best characteristics of two materials and combine them to make a superior product. The combination of the ductile and tough matrix alloy combined with the high strength and modulus of the reinforcement provides properties that can not be matched by any unreinforced alloy.

The behaviour of discontinuously reinforced MMCs can be assumed isentropic because of the random orientation of the fibres or particles as well as the lower aspect ratio of the reinforcements. However, the same can not be said about continuously reinforced MMC. Due to the extent of information regarding both continuously and discontinuously reinforced MMCs, this thesis will only focus on discontinuously reinforced MMCs from this point forward.

1.2.1. Discontinuous MMC production methods

The main advantage of discontinuous MMCs over continuous MMCs is the ease of processing. Modem methods ofprocessing discontinuous MMCs are similar to the techniques used for unreinforced matrix materials. The manufacturing process of MMCs essentially takes the molten metal matrix and mixes in the reinforcements through stir and squeeze casting, spray codeposition, or through solid-state consolidation using powder metallurgy techniques. The

process of casting usually requires a secondary process of either extrusion, forging, or rolling to break apart any reinforcements, distribute the reinforcement throughout the matrix, eliminate any porosity, and in effect, improve the bonding between the reinforcement and the matrix [4,5].
1.2.2. Types of MMCs

The choice of the matrix material strongly depends on the strength, temperature, density, and cost of the intended application of the MMC. For most high strength and moderate temperature

4

applications, titanium alloys seem to be the obvious candidate as the matrix material. There are however many applications where aluminum alloys can compete with titanium alloys as the matrix material, even though the strength and temperature capabilities of aluminum are less than that of titanium. The advantage of aluminum alloys as the matrix material is the cost and

availability compared to that of titanium. Aside from the main factors of strength, thermal efficiency, and cost, the matrix material is also considered based on other factors such as ductility, fracture toughness, and fatigue resistance. The interaction between the matrix material and the reinforcement is also crucial as to avoid any undesirable chemical reaction at the interface between the two materials. Possible reactions between the two materials in the MMC may lead to the formulation of intermetallic compounds at the interface which would lead to detrimental effects in transferring the load from the matrix to the reinforcement. The harmful reaction may also be a common site for crack nucleation [6]. It should be noted that pure metals are not desirable matrix materials due to their mediocre properties when compared with their alloy counterparts. There are three main classes of aluminum alloys that have been selected in the past and used in the present as matrix materials for MMCs. The first class of aluminum alloys are the wrought commercial alloys of 6061, 2124, 2024, and 7075. The second being the lighter aluminumlithium alloys of 8090, and the last being the high-temperature alloys of aluminum-iron and aluminum-scandium. For the most part the development of new matrix materials that would be better suited for MMC applications has been overshadowed by modifying pre-existing aluminum alloy materials. The first classes of aluminum alloys mentioned above are all chosen as suitors for MMCs because they offer adequate mechanical properties and more importantly they are readily available commercially. These aluminum alloys have been well established and studied

5

over the years, and articles such as [7 ,8] have outlined their acceptance as MMC matrix materials. The same can not be said about the second category of aluminum alloys. There is considerable interest in aluminum-lithium alloys in terms of reducing the overall density of the MMC as well as improving the modulus, but to date there has been little research that approves the potential of this alloy for MMC applications. There are several forms of reinforcement that are used in producing discontinuously reinforced aluminum (DRA) MMCs. Of the many

reinforcements that can be used with aluminum alloy matrices, SiC is the one reinforcement that requires the alloy matrix to have approximately 8-9 weight percentage of silicon in it. The inclusion of Si in the aluminum alloy reduces the dislocation of SiC in the MMC and avoids any adverse reaction with the reinforcement. Any aluminum alloy with insufficient silicon content can not be used in conjunction with SiC, but can be used with such reinforcements of Ah03 (Alumina), TiB2 (Titanium Boride), TiC (Titanium Carbide) and B4C (Boron Carbide). If the aluminum alloy matrix contains any magnesium, then it will react with Ah03 reinforcements forming MgAb03. This reaction is not hazardous to the properties of the MMC; however any reinforcements that react with the matrix alloy should be avoided all together. Titanium alloys as matrix materials are the preferable choices when compared to aluminum alloys when cost is not a concern. Titanium alloys offer a higher strength and temperature capability than aluminum alloys and therefore one would assume plenty of research and development in this area of MMCs, however, until recently titanium alloys as a matrix material with discontinuous particle reinforcement has seen very little progress. The common titanium alloy of Ti-6Al-4V (alpha-beta alloy) is the main focus of matrix material in MMC applications under investigation today. Most modem day titanium alloy MMCs are reinforced with TiB2 or TiC particles since SiC particles create an unfavourable reaction with the titanium matrix [6]. 6

1.3. Applications of MMCs
MMCs have found a common place in the aerospace industry, where the need for high performance materials drove the research and development of MMCs and today the cost of production of these materials has dropped to allow for further applications in other commercial markets. The aerospace industries requirement for high performance materials saw the development of MMCs with tailored properties of low density, high strength and stiffness, and thermal expansion and conductivity. These materials were very costly to produce which is why large aerospace budgets accommodated the research and development of MMCs. For the most part, many MMCs used in aerospace applications are of the continuous reinforced type. Continuously reinforced MMCs offer superior performance over discontinuously reinforced composites, which is why the Hubble Telescope used pitch-based continuously reinforced carbon fibre with aluminum as the wave-guide booms since this material provided high strength and stiffness, while reducing the weight and lowering the coefficient of thermal expansion. The automotive industry has also capitalized on the use of MMCs with the application of replacing diesel piston crowns made originally of nickel cast iron with short alumina fibres in an aluminum alloy matrix. This replacement of materials allowed for the production of lighter, more abrasion resistant, and cheaper components. The Honda Motor Company has also found a use for MMCs as engine cylinder liners in the Prelude model of motor vehicles. These liners were composed of carbon and alumina fibres reinforced in an aluminum alloy matrix. The automotive industry has also seen a potential application of MMCs in the design of drive-shafts. The critical speed of a drive shaft is dependent on the diameter and its length of the component, as well as the material parameter of specific stiffness (E/p). As the drive shaft gets longer and the shaft diameter decreases, the critical speed of the shaft reduces. One can increase the critical speed of the drive

7

shaft by increasing the specific stiffness. The use of MMCs as materials for drive-shaft design would allow for higher values of specific stiffness while allowing for shaft components to be produced with smaller diameters and longer length (3].

1.4. Particle-Reinforced Metal Matrix Composites (PMMCs)
1.4.1. Tensile Properties

Discontinuous particle reinforced metal matrix composites have started to mature as one of the most widely known MMC class of materials because of their advanced mechanical properties of strength, stiffness, wear, and corrosion resistance. Of all the reinforcements used in MMC production, SiC particles reinforced in an aluminum alloy matrix are among the most common commercially available MMCs. The tensile properties of this form of MMC has been studied and researched, where it has been determined that multiaxial surface tension in the MMC decreases the ductility of the matrix material [9]. Table 1.1 shows three different Al 2124 matrices

reinforced with both alumina and SiC. The mechanical properties of the various Al2124 MMCs reveal that there is little increase in weight with an increase in strength; however the added stiffness of the ceramic particles reinforcing the matrix decreases the fracture toughness of the material.

Research by Owolabi [ 11] has shown through static tensile and torsional monotonic loading of AI 6061-T6 reinforced with various volume fractions ( v 1 ) of alumina particles that the stressstrain curve of the unreinforced alloy falls below that of the MMC. Figures 1.3 and 1.4 below outline the stress-strain curve of the Al-alumina MMC under both tension and torsion loading.

Both figures 1.3 and 1.4 reveal a similar elastic-plastic transition between the un-reinforced aluminum alloy and the reinforced aluminum alloy with alumina particles. Both these figures also confirm the increase in elastic modulus with the inclusion of reinforcing particles since the slope of the stress-strain curve of the MMC is slightly greater. The effect of the particle size and volume fraction also plays a crucial role in the mechanical stress-strain response of the MMC. Previous studies by Bindumadhavan [12] recognized that the ductility of SiC particles reinforced in Al-Si alloys decreased as the volume fraction

(v1 )

was

increased. So it was advantageous to produce composites with SiC particles with low volume fraction for ease of processing and machining. It was also found that wear resistance of the composite is reduced as the particle size of the reinforcement is reduced. As well, the tensile strength properties of the MMCs tend to increase with the increase in particle size [13], while the fracture toughness of the composite improves with particle size increase [ 14]. Figure 1.5 below outlines the effect of volume fraction of SiC particles reinforced in Al 2024 on the ultimate and yield strength. 10

Volume% SiC

Figure 5: Effect of particle volume fraction

(v1 ) on strength of Al2024 reinforced with SiC [12].

The effect of volume percentage is shown to have a significant effect on the tensile properties of the composites; however, for the Al 2024 matrix reinforced with SiC, there is a limit to the volume percentage of SiC before the MMC starts to decrease in terms of its tensile properties. This limit for Al 2024 with SiC particles is approximately 7 percent volume fraction of reinforcement. Particle size also has an effect on the failure mode along with the previously mentioned strength and ductility of the composite. Both the strength and ductility decrease as the particle size is increased. The failure process for both small (<6.5Jlm) and large (>23Jlm) particles are

distinctively different. For small particles, failure has shown to occur in the matrix material with very few fractured or broken reinforcements. However, the opposite is true for large particle reinforcement, where failure in this case occurs by particle breakage. The optimal choice of particle size reinforcement is in between these two size ranges, where neither mode of failure dominates the other [15].

11

Most discontinuously reinforced MMCs produced today are either of the form of particles or whiskers. Particle reinforcement has found a common place in commercial MMC markets due to their ease in incorporating them into the matrix during production. However, whisker reinforcement has been found to be more efficient in increasing the strength and modulus of the MMCs. This efficiency is due to the whiskers more distinctive length/diameter ratio, which allows for greater transfer of forces between the reinforcement to the matrix when compared with particles. Whiskers just like particles maintain random reinforcement geometry when

produced. This allows for good strength characteristics in all directions of the material [ 1]. The strain rate imposed on an MMC is another factor that affects the stress-strain behaviour of the composite during loading. Research conducted by H. Zhang et. al. [ 16] on Al 6092 with 15 percent boron carbide revealed that variations in low strain rates have an effect on the stressstrain behaviour of the material. For strain rates <ls- 1 , the strength of the material decreases with increasing strain. This behaviour is characteristically associated with dynamic strain aging, which is caused by the presence of fast diffusing solute atoms interacting with moving dislocations [ 17]. Other research by Yadav et. al. [18] showed that the effect of strain rate in particulate reinforced MMCs is strongly dependent on the particle volume fraction. It was then later found that the effect of strain rate is coupled with the volume fraction of the particulate along with the strain hardening of the composite [19].
It has been established that MMCs have superior room temperature mechanical properties, but

also show stronger, more creep resistant, and more wear resistant at elevated temperature than their corresponding unreinforced alloys [20]. However, MMCs do have drawbacks since at elevated temperatures they have limited ductility and crack growth resistance [21]. One study [22] observed that aluminum alloy reinforced with alumina showed that favoured void nucleation 12

sites typically at the interface of the reinforcement and the matrix normal to the applied load, changed to those exhibiting sharp comers in the direction of the loading axis as the temperature increased. Onoro et. al. [23] studied the high temperature effects on the mechanical properties of aluminum 6061 and 7015 as the matrix reinforced with boron carbide particles [23]. It was found that the Al 7015 alloy with 5 wt. % reinforced particles was stronger than that of the unreinforced AI 7015 until about 500 degrees centigrade (see figure 1.6). This is very similar with that of the AI 6061 alloy as the matrix; however the strength values are lower than those of the AI 7015.

Heat treatments of the MMCs have also been shown to change the mechanical response of the material during monotonic loading. Xia et al. [24] has shown that the MMC material with the T6 heat treatment has the highest stiffness and strength, with its stress-strain curve becoming flat when the strain exceeds one percent. Also, there was no clear linear response observed for the material with the TO heat treatment (see figure 1.7).

1.4.2. Fatigue Response of PMMCs Discontinuously reinforced MMCs have a complex fatigue behaviour that can be improved or even degraded by the inclusion of reinforcement, load type, and the type of fatigue test. For MMCs, as well as in many different un-reinforced metal alloys, the factors that improve the crack initiation of the material also decreases its ability to resist the crack growth once initiated. A common example of this behaviour is the influence of reinforcement on the fatigue performance of aluminum alloys. With under-aged aluminum alloys, the inclusion of

reinforcement leads to improvements in fatigue behaviour during stress controlled tests, but causes an increase in fatigue crack propagation rates. However, over-aged aluminum alloys with reinforcements generates both an improvement with the fatigue behaviour and the resistance to fatigue crack propagation. Stress controlled testing also determined that for high cycle fatigue conditions, high volume fractions of fine reinforcement particles are preferred to increase the

14

fatigue crack initiation resistance. For an improvement in the fatigue crack growth resistance, a higher volume fraction of coarser particles is favoured [25]. The fatigue life of discontinuously reinforced MMCs under high cycle stress-life testing has generally shown to be higher or better than that of the un-reinforced metal alloy. The reason for this type of behaviour can be explained by the influence of reinforcement on the materials modulus and work hardening. Since the reinforcements are generally much stronger and stiffer than that of the matrix metal alloy, they in turn cause the MMC to increase in work hardening rate and a reduce in modulus under both monotonic loading and cyclic loading conditions. Therefore during low to moderate loading stresses, which creates high cycle fatigue lives of MMCs, the inclusion of reinforcements improves the materials fatigue characteristics [25]. The opposite can be said during low cycle fatigue testing where the fatigue strength of the MMC converges with that of the un-reinforced metal alloy matrix. In the low cycle regime, the fatigue of the material is controlled by the ductility. Therefore the lower tensile strength and cyclic ductility's of the metal alloy matrix becomes the dominant factor, which explains the reason for the convergence of the fatigue behaviour of the MMC with the un-reinforced metal matrix alloy [25]. During strain-life testing, the opposite fatigue behaviour is observed when compared with stress-life testing. The discontinuously reinforced MMC has clearly shown to have lower fatigue strength when evaluated against the un-reinforced metal matrix alloy. During strain controlled tests, the elastic strain is lower in the MMC than in the un-reinforced alloy at the same stress level. Since the MMC has a higher modulus than the un-reinforced alloy, the same strain in both will result in an increase in plastic strain in the MMC thereby accelerating the fatigue damage in the composite [25]

PMMC Constitutive Equations
2.1. Stress Relations
The deformation/strain of a specimen is the response of the material body to an applied force or stress. To understand the stress and strain behaviour of a material, relations that allow the strain to be calculated straight from the stress and vice versa are essential, which are called constitutive relations. There are an unlimited number of constitutive parameters/constants which relate a particular response to a specific perturbation of a continuum system. A constitutive parameter

and a constitutive equation both predict a response usually under a set or" strict limits. In order to understand the consequences from a given constitutive parameter a model for the mechanical behaviour must be considered based on the understanding of both structure and morphology for a given material. The general state of stress follows that a positive stress vector acts normal to a positive cubic face and points to a positive coordinate direction. In a homogeneous material, for each of the three surfaces on a cubic element shown in figure 2.1, there are a total of 3 stress components of a normal and two shear stresses. This makes a 9 component second order stress tensor. In basic Cartesian coordinates, the second order tensor,
aij'

is given by:

16

(2.1)

y

Figure 2.1: stress states on a 3-dimensional cubic element.

The general stress state has been shown to have nine components, in which three are normal stresses and six are shear stresses. In a homogeneous material, these nine components are reduced to 6 where ixy = iyx'
ixz

= izx and iyz = izy·

The stress on a body is a function of the angle of rotation, where there occurs a specific angle in which the normal stresses are either maximum or minimum. These maximum and minimum stresses are called principal stresses. When principal stresses are achieved, the corresponding shear stresses on the element are all equal to zero. Since there are three principal directions in the three-dimensional stress state, there are always three principal stresses ordered as a1

> a2 >

a 3 . To calculate the principal stresses one would have to determine the angular direction of e in
which the derivative of the function a= [(8) set equal to zero is a maximum or a minimum. Solving for these principal stresses:

For the plane stress case, in the x-y plane, the stress of az is equal to zero. Therefore the values of a1 and a 2 are not always necessarily the first two principal stresses until they are compared with az

= 0.

Performing further trigonometric substitution similar to how equation 2.5 was

derived gives the planes stress case of maximum shear stress as:

imax

(2.6)

Recalling equation (2.1 ), the mean of stress components along the diagonal is referred to as the hydrostatic stress. Hydrostatic stresses cause volumetric expansion or contraction of a cubic stress element. For a material specimen studied in atmosphere conditions, the hydrostatic

component of stress is a 3-D tensile stress that has a magnitude of atmospheric pressure P. The hydrostatic stress is the first of three scalar invariants for the total stress tensor. The hydrostatic stress, ah, is obtained from the average of normal stress components as:

(2.7)

where / 1(, from equation (2. 7), is the first invariant of the total stress tensor. Sometimes it is desirable to remove the hydrostatic stress from the stress tensor. The total stress tensor always has the contribution of hydrostatic stress in it, while the deviatoric stress tensor excludes the value of hydrostatic pressure and is usually denoted as t, as is shown as:

(2.8)

Equation (2.8) revealed the first of the three scalar invariants of the total stress tensor. The other two scalar invariants of the total stress tensor are given as:

2.2. Strain Relations
Materials will tend to change shape and deform under applied stresses. Such deformation is known as dilation, which is volumetric change caused by the normal stress components of the stress tensor. Material deformation is referred as distortion if the shear stress component in the total stress tensor is dominant. In general, the strain tensor is of second order, with nine components and is defined by both normal, eu, and shear, eii' components as:

(2.11)

The total strain tensor is usually decomposed into two components consisting of the strain tensor,
Eii' and the vorticity/rotational tensor, wii' where the components are:

(2.12)

(2.13)

The strain tensor shown in equation (2.12) is a symmetric 6 component tensor while the rotational tensor, equation (2.13), is an asymmetric 3 component tensor.

2.3. Stress/Strain Constitutive Relations
The materials response is prone to stress, strain, strain rate, and the constitutive equations relating stress and strain components. In this section, materials deformation (elastic and plastic) will be discussed and constitutive models relating applied stress and induced deformation (strain) will be presented.
2.3.1. Elastic Deformation

In general we consider each component of the total stress tensor as having a direct relationship with each component of the total strain tensor. This general case generates 9 x 9 = 81 possible components of the elastic modulus tensor. For Tii and Ekl we find that Cijkl has 81 components, (2.14) However, both Tij and are symmetric tensors = This reduces the modulus tensor to

When the elastic constant matrix is independent of orientation of the material, the material is referred to as mechanically isotropic. Materials such as metal alloys and discontinuous PMMCs are of isotropic form. Because of this isentropic symmetry, the 36 independent elastic constants reduce to 21 terms in the tensor. Most materials display some degree of mechanical symmetry. The materials used in this research study displayed 3 orthogonal planes of symmetry, which reduced the independent elastic constants to 9 parameters. 21

Therefore for an isotropic material, all that is required to characterize the mechanical response of the material is a normal and a shear stress-strain component. (2.18) where E and G are the elastic modulus and the shear modulus of the material, respectively. When a tensile stress in the direction of the x-axis produces an elongation along that axis, it also generates a contraction in they and z directions. This contraction is described by the Poisson ratio, v, (2.19)

For most metals and PMMCs the value of Poisson's ratio ranges from 0.28-0.35. Since for an isotropic material, there are two independent variables of modulus

(B

and Jl in equation (2.19)),

the tensile elastic modulus, the Poisson's ratio, and the shear elastic modulus are related by:

So for an isotropic material, the principal strain component is given by:

(2.23)

The normal stress is related to the normal strain using Hooke's Law: (2.24)

Similarly, the shear stress is related to the shear strain as: (2.25)

2.3.2. Plastic Deformation Experimentally it has been shown that under uniaxial loading, the strain at a given stress has two distinct parts; the recoverable elastic strain, and the irreversible plastic strain as shown in figure 2.3.

23

Figure 2.3: Stress-strain diagram undergoing plastic deformation.

The total strain of a specimen is composed of both the elastic and plastic strain components: (2.26) The reversible part of elastic strain is related to the stress through the typical linear elastic equations (Hooke's Law). Plastic constitutive relations are concerned with characterizing the irreversible part. For multiaxialloading conditions, the general strain increment and plastic parts as: is decomposed into elastic

dEij

(2.27)

Recall that the elastic part of the total strain is related to the stress using the linear elastic equation: (2.28)

24

Before establishing a full description that relates plastic strain to stress, it should first be noted the criteria that predicts the onset of plastic deformation. The general nature of a polycrystalline solid assumes that yield (transition from elastic to inelastic deformation) is independent of hydrostatic stress and that the material is isotropic. The first of these assumptions implies that the yield criterion can only depend on the deviatoric stress components as:

(2.29)

The assumption of the material being isotropic implies that the onset of yield strictly depends on the magnitudes of the principal stresses, 5 11 5 2 ,53 , and can not depend on the principal normal stress directions, and materials yielding is dominantly dependent upon the invariants of the deviatoric stress tensor.

= 0 or F(/2 ,13 , material state variables) = 0, where the

material state variables characterizes the strength of the solid. Upon loading of a ductile material beyond yielding point, unloading, and then re-loading it a further plastic flow in material is induced and the material gains a higher resistance to plastic flow. This phenomenon is known as strain hardening. Strain hardening can be modeled by relating .the size and shape of the yield surface to the plastic strain. The easiest way to do this is to make the yield surface increase in size but remain the same shape as the result of plastic deformation. This is known as isotropic hardening. So for isotropic hardening, some

appropriate relationship between the material constants of Y or k and the plastic strain is

25

required. To get a suitable scalar measure of the plastic strain, the accumulated plastic work or accumulated plastic strain magnitude (equations (2.31) and (2.32), respectively) can be used: (2.31)

A=f

(2.32)

Then by putting Y = H(A) , the function H can be determined by curve fitting a uniaxial tension test. Several other common forms of hardening functions are shown below in figure 2.4

- - - - - t -Y

Power-law hardening solid

Figure 2.4: Other common hardening functions.

Isotropic hardening laws are generally not very useful in situations where components are subjected to repeated or cyclic loading. Isentropic hardening fails to differentiate materials

yielding under tension and compression as to include the Bauschinger' s effect. To account for this effect, the kinematic hardening law was established that allows the yield surface to translate, without changing shape. As the material is deformed in tension, the yield

26

surface is dragged in the direction of increasing stress. This also allows for the softening of the material in compression, and thus allowing this constitutive law to model cyclic plastic deformation. There is still a need to calculate the plastic strains induced by loading that exceed the materials yield. The plastic flow rule is a method to calculate these strains. Note that the magnitude of the plastic strain is determined by the hardening rule as the continued plastic flow. This is the case because during continued plastic flow, the stress state must present a point on the yield surface at all times. Since the position for kinematic hardening of the yield surface is related to the

magnitude of the plastic strain increment through an appropriate hardening law, it therefore means that the plastic strain magnitude must be related to the stress increment. The plastic strain increment is given as:

(2.33)

Assuming f( uii' A.) = 0 represents the yield criterion, then, the material yielding is defined as:

at dt -dU··+-dA.=O auij l] dit
Equation (2.33) is known as the consistency equation. Rearranging equation (2.33):

The flow rule can also be applied to develop the plastic strain direction. It is necessary therefore to specify only the ratios of the plastic strain components. The general form of plastic strain is defined as:

(2.36)

where

Gij

is a function of stress and strain history, and needs to be satisfied by

Gij = Gji

and

There are restrictions involved in

G ij.

The first is that plastic strains are volume preserving, so

Gii = 0. Second, plastic strain increments for crystalline solids are independent of hydrostatic
loading, and lastly annealed polycrystalline solids are mainly isotropic at least for small strains. The constitutive law with these features can be constructed by setting function, g =

where the

f (a ij) = 0.

To understand the relationship between strain-energy and stress-strain data one can consider that energy is equal to a force, F, applied over a distance, x.
dU = F(x)dx = xF(e)de

The force in the Hookean elastic curve shown in figure 2.5 follows the basic function:
F(e) = AEE = x 2 Ee

(2.44)

where A is the unit area of the applied stress, which reduces equation (2.44) to:

(2.45)

where V is the unit volume of the specimen. The strain energy density, U0 , is calculated by dividing the energy by the unit volume. 30

Finite Element Analysis of Stress-Strain Response of AI 6061 I Ah03-T6 Composite
3.1. Introduction
It is evident that the mechanical behaviour of PMMCs not only depends on the metal matrix

microstructure, but also on the load transfer from the metallic matrix through to the rigid reinforcement. This load transfer can be studied through micromechanical models based on the concepts of continuum mechanics. The method of analysis that was employed to study this mechanical behaviour was simulated by modeling a periodic unit cell of the PMMC through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) [26]. These FE models were used to study the interaction

between an Al 6061-T6 metallic matrix and Ah03 spherical ceramic particles with volume fractions of 10 and 20 percent versus the un-reinforced Al 6061-T6 matrix metal subjected to uniaxial loading conditions. The unit cell method of analysis used to formulate the finite element PMMC model is based on the representation shown in figure 3.1, where the PMMC is idealized as a three dimensional array of hexagonal prisms. The reinforcement particle is located at the centre of each cylindrical metallic matrix, where the size of the particle was determined by the volume percentage of particles in the PMM composite. The amount of volume fraction of particles in the PMMC was equated to the total volume percentage of the single particle in the cylindrical metallic matrix.

32

Figure 3.1: PMM composite idealized from a 3-D hexagonal prism to a cylindrical matrix with a spherical particle located at the centre [5]. The idealization of the hexagonal unit cell model transposed into a cylindrical matrix with a single particle located at the centre was first proposed by Tvergaard [27]. The idealized cylindrical unit cell is also required to remain cylindrical during deformation to ensure that the displacement compatibility between neighbouring hexagonal prisms (neighbouring prisms are illustrated in figure 3.1). Therefore the straight lines bounding each cell must remain straight during loading. The reinforcement particle and the surrounding matrix are considered perfectly bonded by maintaining displacement continuity across the interface.

3.2. ANSYS Finite Element Equations
The finite element equations used in the ANSYS solver capture the characteristics of the field equations. The formulation of these equations is based on the governing differential equations or the global energy balance [28].

33

The approach of utilizing the governing differential equations is known as the method of weighted residuals (Galerkin's method). This method is the approximation of the functional behaviour of the dependent variable at which their substitution into the governing differential equation leads to an error called a residual. The governing differential equation for the physical problem, as shown as domain Din figure 3.2 is expressed as:

The known functions of Bi and hi impose

the boundary conditions on the dependent variable and its derivatives. The dependent variable over C1 is referred to as essential/forced boundary conditions, with the derivatives of the dependent variable over C2 referred to as natural boundary conditions. The weighted residuals method requires that:

f[L( (fi)- f]WkdD = 0 , with k = 1,2,3, ..... , n

(3.4)

where Wk are the weighting functions. These functions approximate the dependent variable as:

(3.5)

The unknown coefficients of ak are found by solving for the system equations, while satisfying the essential boundary conditions on C1 .

Partitioning the domain, D, into sub-domains or elements, vCe), then applying Galerkin's method with weighting functions Wk = N~e) over the elements domain results in:

The shape functions do not need to satisfy the boundary conditions, but they must satisfy the inter-element continuity conditions which are necessary for the assembly of the element equations. The essential boundary conditions are thus imposed after assembling the global

matrix. The natural boundary conditions are not implemented directly; however, they have a direct influence on the derivation of the element equations. The specific order of the element continuity is equal to one less than the highest derivative of the dependent variable appearing in the integrand. This requirement is relaxed by applying

integration by parts in the minimization procedure of the residual error in Galerkin's method. The approach that involves the global energy balance is referred to as the variational method (Rayleigh-Ritz method). The global energy balance approach is utilized to determine the This requires the functional behaviour of the dependent From

variational calculus, the minimum stationary value leading to stable equilibrium is found when the first variation of the global energy vanishes. The concepts of differential calculus can be used to perform the minimization of the global energy. In terms of solid mechanics, this concept is known as the principal of minimum

potential energy. The correct displacement field satisfying the equilibrium equations is the one that results in the potential energy being an absolute minimum. The solution of both equilibrium equations and boundary conditions is considered exact, however at times can be difficult to construct for complex FE problems. Therefore approximate solutions can be obtained by The

3.3. Unit Cell Model
The particular material used in the development of our PMM composite unit cell model is Al 6061-T6 reinforced with 10 and 20 volume percent of aluminum oxide ceramic particles. Details of mechanical properties for both the metallic matrix and ceramic reinforcement can be found in Appendix A (Tables (Al-l) and (Al-3)). Since the PMM composite model is loaded statically beyond its local yield stress, a kinematic hardening curve had to be added to the ANSYS Al 6061-T6 material library, to account for the non-linearity in the Al 6061-T6 alloy matrix during plastic deformation. Figure 3.4 shows the Al 6061-T6 plastic strain-stress curve at room

temperature imported into the ANS YS material library.

The stress-strain analysis of the PMMC is a 3D plasticity problem. To properly model this problem the cylinder with the spherical particle inclusion would be representative of one unit cell.

The cylinder dimensions are defined from the condition that the height His twice as large as its radius. The definition of the matrix cylinder allows for the calculation of the spherical particle radius with the following equation:

In equation (3 .16), the value of r represents the spherical particle radius, V 1 is the volume fraction of distributed particles, R is the matrix cylinder radius, and H is the height of the cylinder. All calculations were conducted for a model with H= 2R. Two physical 3D models were generated with Solidworks 2005 for the PMM composites with the two reinforcement volume fractions of 10 and 20 percent. Each model was imported into ANSYS Workbench 11 where they were first meshed. ANSYS workbench has a built in mesh

The physical preference of the mesh is set to mechanical, with medium meshing relevance and smoothing. The solid element midsize nodes and element size were both set to program controlled. Figure 3.6 shows AI 6061 I Ab03 I 10p-T6 PMM composite fully meshed. Refinement of the solid mesh was performed at the interface between the reinforcement particle and the metallic matrix.

The generated mesh was then imported into ANSYS Workbench simulation. Once imported, the material properties of the reinforcement particle and metallic matrix were respectively set to Ah0 3 and AI 6061-T6. Both materials were set to flexible for their stiffness behaviour and with non-linear effects turned on for just the Al6061-T6 matrix. The model geometry also had to be manipulated by changing the connectivity between the reinforcement particle and the metallic matrix to be perfectly bonded with symmetric behaviour. The time-stepped static analysis is then set-up to evaluate the stress-strain behaviour of the PMM composite during uniaxial loading. The loading conditions were set to a uniaxial force that was ramped from zero to 100,000 Newton's in the positive y-direction. The boundary conditions were set as to fix the bottom end of the PMM composite and to allow zero displacement in the x and z directions about the outside of the PMMC to maintain compatibility. Due to the high deformation upon loading, the analysis settings were set to large displacement, with program controlled spring stiffness. The output controls were then set to capture the stress and strain data at each individual time step in the analysis.

This is obvious since the occurrence of a notch results in a stress increase locally. The results of the stress-strain behaviour of both PMM composite simulated models were recorded initially in tabular form within the ANSYS output file and then used to generate the two simulated stress-strain curves shown in figure 3.9.

Fatigue Damage Approaches
4.1. Fatigue Damage Behaviour of Materials
The word fatigue as defined by the ASTM standards, contained in ASTM E 1150, states in note 1 that "fatigue is the process of progressive localized permanent structural change occurring in a material subjected to conditions that produce fluctuating stresses and strains at some point or points and that may culminate in cracks or complete fracture after a sufficient number of fluctuations [30]. There have been several different methods developed to date that deal

specifically with repeated loading of components. The earliest of these methods is the stress-life approach which was developed in the 1800's as Whaler conducted rotating-bending fatigue tests on metallic material components resulting in fatigue diagrams, known as S-N diagrams. StressLife (S-N) data presents a number of fatigue cycles to failure at any given cyclic stress level. The strain-life approach on the other hand takes into account both the elastic and plastic repeated strains versus life cycles. The stress-based approaches describe the high-cycle fatigue regime

(N

> 10 5 cycles) and the strain-based methods characterize fatigue life of components at the

low-cycle regime (N < 10 5 cycles). Besides these two methods, there are approaches to include both terms of stress and strain to characterize fatigue life of components for both low and high cycle regimes.

4.2. Fatigue Damage Approaches
The damage caused by fatigue on a component increases with the number of applied cycles in a cumulative manner which could result in component failure. The theory of cumulative fatigue

47

damage has been studied for quite some time, as seen by Palmgren's [31] concept of the linear rule more than 80 years ago. Miner [32] then expressed the linear rule in mathematical form in 1945. Since then, the studies of cumulative fatigue damage models have received increasing attention. Most cumulative fatigue damage models proposed before the 1970's was predominately phenomenological. These theories were more concerned with the estimation of the total life of components under specific types of loadings. These theories made no distinction of the initiation of the crack and the crack propagation. While those models developed after the 1970's gradually developed into more semi-analytical or analytical theories. There are three main categories of uniaxial and multiaxial damage models that have been proposed and published throughout literature. The mean stress, energy, and critical plane
It was not until the early 1970's

where multiaxial fatigue research started to become better established.

Today, increased

research in this area has been conducted both experimentally and theoretically; however, it is yet to establish a fatigue damage theory to universally characterize fatigue damage of materials undergoing loading conditions. The following sections present a few of the most popular

damage models employed in this thesis.

4.2.1. Smith-Watson-Topper (S.W.T) Approach
It has been established that tensile mean stress has a detrimental influence on the fatigue life,

while compressive mean stresses increase the performance and is also known to increase the fatigue strength of a component. The Smith-Watson-Topper (S.W.T.) parameter was established 48

to account for the effects of mean stresses in the strain-life approach. The variables of interest with the S.W.T. damage parameter are the maximum stress,
(Jmax'

and the strain range,

the stable hysteresis loop [33]. Figure 4.1 schematically presents a hysteresis loop of a cycle fluctuating with a stress ratio of R

The strain range of the hysteresis loop provides the driving force for growing small microcracks. The higher the value of maximum stress the easier it is for these micro-cracks to grow. The S.W.T. parameter was proposed to account for this damage as:

(4.1)

A loading cycle with high maximum stress and small strain range cycles can do as much damage as a cycle with low maximum stresses and high cyclic strains.
4.2.2. Critical Plane Approach

One major disadvantage many damage models neglect to account for is that they can not describe the experimentally observed reality that fatigue cracking tends to originate and

49

PROPERTY OF YERSON UNIVERSITY LIBRARY

propagate along specific critical planes. Researchers have concluded that materials experience either shear dominated or tensile dominated fatigue cracking behaviour. Many materials will exhibit one form of cracking before transitioning to the other during crack propagation. The type of cracking a material will experience is mainly dependent on the material itself, the local state of stress/strain and the magnitude of stresses and strains. The critical plane damage models were developed based on physical material damage on the crystallographic planes where the maximum resolved shear stress acts. Many critical plane damage models have been proposed, however, the Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie models will be focused in the present thesis.

4.2.2.1. Brown-Miller Approach
Brown and Miller developed an approach that was based on a physical interpretation of the mechanisms that controlled fatigued crack growth. Brown and Miller figured that the fatigue lives of materials could be correlated by considering both the maximum shear strain and tensile strain acting across the maximum shear strain plane as the principal controlling parameters. Based on this idea, they developed gamma planes, which were essentially contours of constant life plotted with the normal strain value, vertical axis. Brown and Miller defined two types of cracks that may propagate along these critical planes. Type A cracks and Type B cracks. Type A cracks were defined as long shallow cracks that grew along the surface of the material, much like cracks that are created from torsion loading. Type B cracks grew into the depth of the material. This theory is expressed in equation form as:

(4.2) 50

where .1y is the shear range of strain on the plane experiencing the maximum range of shear, .1cn is the normal strain range on this plane, and S is a material constant.

4.2.2.2. Fatemi-Socie Approach
A few years later after Brown and Miller proposed their critical plane damage theory, Fatemi and Socie, based on their own observations, realized that mean stresses affect the development, density, and orientation of the microcracks. Fatemi and Socie modified the Brown-Miller

damage model to include the mean stress effect as:

Ymax ( 1 + K :~) = constant

(4.3)

where Ymax is the maximum shear strain amplitude, an is the tensile mean stress perpendicular to the plane of maximum shear strain amplitude, constant.

approached 1, while for short fatigue lives the value of K reduced.

4.2.3. Energy Approach
Multiaxial damage models which relate the fatigue life of a specimen to work or strain energy are considered here and are termed energy models. Energy methods have been able to correlate experimentally obtained fatigue lives quite well when measuring with hysteresis loops. During cyclic loading, energy is absorbed mainly because of plastic deformation. The majority of this mechanical energy is converted into heat, while the remaining part of the energy causes

51

damage in the material. The magnitude of damage experienced by a material during fatigue cycles is very much dependent on loading inputs and the fatigue resistance of a material is directly related to its capacity to absorb the energy input. To calculate the total strain energy, the elastic and plastic strain energy components should be calculated separately as: (4.4)

The elastic strain energy density is defined as: (4.5)

The stress-strain relationship for an isotropic elastic material is given as:

(4.6)

where v is the Poisson's ratio, E is the elastic modulus and 8ij is the Kronecker delta which is equal to unity when i = j and zero when i =I= j. The elastic cyclic strain energy is therefore calculated from equation (4.5) for the positive stress parts of the cycle:

Ellyin et.al. [35] proposed a stable cyclic stress-strain relation for the multiaxial stress state, which they formulated into a master curve concept. For the uniaxial case, the master curve concept is defined to envelope the upper loading of the hysteresis for various strain amplitudes.

This equation corresponds to the total strain energy density during plastic deformation and is expressed as: (4.17) The range of equivalent stress and the range of equivalent plastic strain are denoted respectively with flii* and f1£P.

Therefore the total strain energy, l:l W t, is found by adding the elastic strain energy of equation 4.9 with that ofthe plastic strain energy of equation (4.21): (4.22) The calculation of the plastic strain energy density followed a constitutive law relating the plastic strain to the deviatoric stress. The theory used to establish the plastic strain energy followed a deformation type of plasticity theory, which would predict similar results in the case of incremental theory of proportional or nearly proportional loading [3 7].

4.2.4. Critical Plane-Energy Approach The critical plane-energy damage model proposed earlier by Varvani [38] integrated the normal energy range and the shear energy range, calculated from the critical plane where the stress and strain Mohr's circles are the largest during loading and unloading reversals of cycles. This damage parameter incorporates both the normal and shear stress and strain components on the critical plane and provides a weighting factor of the normal and shear components using fatigue parameters. The damage parameter also takes into account the effect of mean stress applied, which is applied normal to the plane of maximum shear. Also, the parameter increases with the addition of hardening caused by out-of-phase straining, while this is neglected to be accounted for in earlier developed strain based damage parameters. Varvani' s damage parameter has been formulated for uniaxial and multiaxial fatigue conditions. For a thin-walled tubular specimen, the strain and stress tensors subjected to both axial and torsional fatigue are given by:

The value of (} responds to the angle during a cycle of strain at which the Mohr's circle is the largest and has a maximum value of shear strain. The phase delay <p represents the delay between the strains on the axial and the torsional axes. Also, from equation (4.24), llaa and

4.3. Comparison of Damage Approaches
4.3.1. Advantages/Disadvantages The stress and the strain based damage parameters are among the first models to evaluate fatigue life of components. Other fatigue damage models of critical plane, energy, and critical planeenergy were developed based on components of stress and/or strain for low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue regimes. Fatigue damage parameters are different in capability and they possess some strengths and weaknesses. The Smith-Watson-Topper (S.W.T) approach is applied to correlate the fatigue life of components when fatigue failure is dominantly due to tensile cracking. When tensile cracking was the dominant crack mode, the S.W.T. model showed a good ability to account for the effects of cyclic hardening or softening [39]. However, the S.W.T. model can not predict the tension-compression loading cases when the maximum stress applied are very low. Both the critical plane and energy models have .been equally successful in correlating experimental fatigue life data. Since energy based models reflect the path dependency of the fatigue process, this allows for explicit consideration of the multiaxial stress-strain response. 61

One disadvantage with energy approaches is that they tend to diverge at long lives. Energy models are very sensitive to the constitutive model employed when they are used to predict fatigue failure. These models when used during non-proportional loading do not predict a mean stress effect. The Fatemi-Socie critical plane approach when compared with the Brown-Miller critical plane approach is better suited when the need for additional hardening and mean stress have to be accounted for. Also, both critical plane models require a damage parameter constant for each specific material and loading condition. This makes the use of these models difficult when there is limited information regarding the materials cyclic fatigue. Critical plane models have also been criticized for their lack of adherence to rigorous continuum mechanics fundamentals. The critical plane-energy model of Varvani has successfully correlated multiaxial fatigue life damage for various in-phase and out-of-phase multiaxial fatigue straining conditions, where a mean stress was applied normal to the maximum shear plane and during out-of-phase fatigue tests where additional hardening is experienced.

Damage Assessment of PMMCs and Results
5.1. General Parameters in Damage ofPMMCs
5.1.1. Crack Initiation and Growth PMMCs have complex fatigue behaviour, which are mainly affected due to the incorporation of reinforcement [25]. Extensive research in crack initiation of silicon carbide and alumina reinforced aluminum matrix has been performed [25,40]. Many different sources of crack

initiation have been identified with these materials. Crack initiation is mostly due to fracture of the reinforcement particle, decohesian of the reinforcement from the matrix, fracture of large particles and porosity in the composite. Reinforcement materials are very brittle in nature. These particles usually fracture in the initial stages of fatigue during the first few cycles. Microcracks then advance into the matrix alloy. This phenomenon is due to the high local strain concentration produced by microcracks in the reinforcement with the surrounding matrix. This form of crack initiation is most commonly observed in PMMCs reinforced with alumina [41 ,42]. The decohesion of the reinforcement from the matrix usually occurs in the interface between the reinforcement and the matrix, or in the matrix near the matrix-reinforcement interface. This is most commonly found in PMMCs reinforced with silicon carbide [43]. In most cases of

decohesian, cracks are initiated from particle clusters [44]. Large inclusions and intermetallics in the PMMC are prone to fracture because of their brittle nature. This crack initiation behaviour is

63

most commonly seen with 2000 series aluminum alloy matrices because of their high alloy content [45]. Fatigue cracks can also initiate in MMCs due to porosity. A PMMC containing large pores will typically fail due to a fatigue crack initiated from one of these pores. When PMMCs are

produced through liquid metallurgy, pores will typically arise from incomplete penetration of the metal matrix alloy into the particle cluster [46]. Fatigue cracks initiate at or near the surface of a PMMC material, regardless of the initiating defect. This verifies that surface defects are exposed to higher cyclic plastic strains, and once fractured, exposed to higher stress-intensity factors than those defects located within a bulk material. Consequently, cracks initiate far earlier from

surface defects than the interior of the material, and thus grow faster once initiated [13]. The fatigue life of PMMCs is increased under load-controlled conditions due to the increase in the materials stiffness and strength [47]. An increase in fatigue life is attributed to the higher elastic modulus of PMMCs than its metallic matrix. Under load-controlled fatigue conditions a PMMC displays a lower total strain as compared with its base alloy, resulting in an increased life. In strain-controlled condition, the strain in PMMC and the base alloy are the same (isostrain condition), but the stress in the PMMC material would be higher. The higher stress levels in the PMMC result in fracture or decohesian of the reinforcement, and therefore reduce the fatigue life of materials. The direction of crack growth in PMMCs is driven by the interaction between the reinforcement particles and the fatigue crack. This is because reinforcement particles change the stress field surrounding the crack tip. This change in stress-field depends on factors such as whether or not the particle fractures, decoheres, or remains intact during fatigue cycles. Therefore the main

64

factors controlling the fatigue process of PMMCs are the reinforcement type, reinforcement volume fraction and size, and the matrix aging condition.

5.1.2. The Effect of Particle Size and Volume fraction
To date, it is difficult to find any direct comparisons between the fatigue behaviour of similar alloys reinforced with various types of particles. This is due to the pre-eminence of silicon carbide as the reinforcing particle type for MMCs. For elongated particles, such as whiskers, they will inhibit crack growth when the fatigue crack is propagating perpendicular to the particle and accelerates the crack growth when propagating parallel to the particle [48]. The effect of reinforcement volume fraction varies with the average size of the reinforcement. It has been observed that an increase in volume fraction decreases the fatigue crack growth rate when the MMC is reinforced with large particles (> 1Of.tm) [49] and increases the fatigue crack growth rate in MMCs reinforced with small particles (<3 J..Lm) [45]. This difference of fatigue crack growth rate arises from the fact that a fatigue crack reacts differently when interacting with particles of various size. When a fatigue crack interacts with a small particle, the particle tends to constrain the crack growth since smaller particles have fewer tendencies to fracture when compared to large particles. This results in a flat fracture path, low levels of roughness induced closure, and faster fatigue crack growth. For a given reinforcement volume fraction, MMCs with larger

particles tend to be distributed further apart from one another. Since these larger particles are more prone to fracture when compared to smaller particles, they tend to promote the fatigue crack.

65

5.1.3. The Effect of Aging Treatment

For un-reinforced aluminum alloys, the fatigue crack growth threshold decreases with the increased aging [50]. The aging treatment changes the slip characteristics of the metal matrix. When particles are introduced to the matrix, they suppress this effect [51]. This suppression is because fatigue cracks are more likely to grow towards cracked particles and leave behind uncracked small particles. Therefore, the crack propagation path is controlled by the size, spacing, and fracture characteristics of the reinforced particles.

5.2. Fatigue Tests and Data
The techniques, specimens, and equipment used in fatigue testing of un-reinforced metal alloys resemble those used for the testing of PMMCs. The difference lies in the preparation of PMMCs when compared with base alloys. This section presents materials and fatigue test data available in literature [10,45,56,57] employed in this thesis. Four sets of PMMC alloys fatigue tested under various conditions were described in detail.

5.2.1. Aluminum 6061 I Ah03 I 20p-T6

The material used in this study is made commercially available with an aluminum 6061 metal alloy matrix with 20 % by volume of aluminum oxide (Ab03 ) particles. manufactured by Duralcan in the USA. This PMMC is

It is produced in large batches by mixing molten

aluminum and ceramic particles using their own proprietary methods [52]. The material used for this data set was produced by extruding the PMMC at 350°C through a 2-hole extrusion die, with the final solid circular rod having a diameter of 31. 7mm. Prior to component machining, the 66

PMMC was heat treated to the T6 condition. The distribution of aluminum oxide particles
remained essentially macroscopically isotropic and there was little direction dependency of any mechanical properties of the final material specimen. Table 5.1 details the uniaxial properties of aluminum oxide, aluminum 6061-T6 and 6061 I Ah03 I 20p-T6. Table 5.1: Uniaxial mechanical properties of Al6061 I Alz0 3 I 20p-T6 and it constituents [53,54].

In Table 5.1 the inclusion of ceramic particles in the alloy matrix improved the stiffness of the material by almost 41%. The yield and ultimate strength of the PMMC is also improved from that of the base alloy by 27% and 20% respectively. However, due to the increase in stiffness caused by the ceramic particles, the elongation percentage of the PMMC is reduced by 80%. Fatigue tests were performed on AI 6061 I Ah03 I 20p-T6 specimens under strain-controlled tensile, torsional, and tensile-torsion conditions. Tests were conducted at room temperature

using a digitally controlled, closed-loop, servo hydraulic testing machine with a constant amplitude, fully reversed loading condition (R= -1 ). For all the loading cases performed on this material, the high amplitude tests were run at a frequency of0.5 Hz and low amplitude tests were run at 1 Hz. Proportional loading was performed for all combined uniaxial/torsion tests, at the biaxial strain ratio of:

67

(5.1)

The value of the biaxial strain ratio was chosen such that the axial and shear strain amplitudes levels could be considered equivalent according to the von Mises criteria. For the torsional and combined uniaxial/torsional cases, the tests were first run at strain-controlled until the torque or torque/loads were stabilized, then the tests would resume under torque or torque/load settings. This is common procedure to avoid unnecessary damage to the extensometer at failure. Figures 5.1a and 5.1b presents specimen geometries used for the fatigue tests for this material. The dimensions shown in this figure correspond to the recommended uniaxial low cycle fatigue specimen design based on ASTM E606 [55]. Figure 5.1b shows a tubular shaft, which is common to use for torsional and combined axial/torsional fatigue tests since a uniform shear stress and shear strain distribution is assumed constant over the wall thickness.

The life calculations performed during these tests assumed that the fatigue failure of the specimens was controlled by the state of stress and strain on the materials outer surface. Because of this assumption, the outer surface stress/strain states for each loading case was required to be stabilized based on the experimentally obtained data. For the uniaxial loading case, the axial stress was found directly from the stabilized experimental load amplitude using the specimen original test cross-sectional area.

5.2.2. Aluminum 6061 I Alz03 I 22p-T6 The material data was WD-22A also of Duralcan, USA. This material is a 6061-T6 aluminum alloy matrix reinforced with 22 volume percent of aluminum oxide particles. The fatigue test specimens used were cut from extruded tubes that measured with an outside diameter of 45mm and with a wall thickness of 2mm. Figure 5.2 shows the geometric dimension of the extruded tube used for fatigue tests.

The PMMC specimens were heat-treated to a T6 condition, then after treatment, the specimens were machined to the final dimensions shown in figure 5.2. Fatigue tests were performed using a servo-hydraulic closed loop machine. The combined uniaxial/pure shear tests were subjected to internal and external pressures (Pi and Pe) with an axial force ofF. A schematic diagram of the test machine is shown in figure 5.3 where it is seen how the uniaxial and internal pressures are applied during fatigue test loading.

Figure 5.3: Schematic diagram of the test set-up rig [57]. Four types of fatigue tests were conducted on Al 6061 I Ab03 I 22p-T6; uniaxial tension, pure shear, bi-axial in-phase and bi-axial90° out-of-phase. The fatigue tests would automatically stop cycling once a fatigue crack penetrated through the specimen wall thickness. Once a throughthe-wall crack has occurred the hydraulic oil will leak into the external pressure system, causing a loss in pressure in the internal system. Any loss in pressure to the internal system halts the testing of the specimen. For the uniaxial fatigue testing, a relatively small amount of internal pressure was needed to detect cracks without any significant effect on the specimens stress state (:::; 10 MPa in hoop stress)

5.2.3. Aluminum 6061 I SiC I 17w-T6

The two materials tested in this investigation was un-reinforced AI 6061 and AI 6061 reinforced with 17% silicon carbide whisker particulate. The composite was produced through a squeeze casting process. Table 5.2 details the mechanical properties of the PMMC and its matrix constituent.

The average diameter and length of the whiskers was respectively 0.84J.tm and 4.86J.tm. The PMMC was heat-treated to the T6 condition. Initially the extruded PMMC had a circular diameter of 18.9mm, however, after machining and smoothing the dimensions became 8mm in diameters with a gauge length of 5mm. The surfaces of the test specimens were polished with emery papers and then followed with a coating of diamond paste, which gave the material a mirror finish. The fatigue tests were conducted with a computer controlled electro-hydraulic tension-torsion testing machine. The cyclic fatigue tests were run with a stress ratio of R=0 .1, and at a stress cycle frequency of 5 Hz under in-phase combined tension-torsion loading. All tests were

conducted using load-control conditions, where the combined stress ratio of a (a remains constant. Where a varied from 0 for pure tension to oo for pure torsion.

5.2.4. Ti-6Al-4 V I TiC I 1Op
This material is referred as CermeTi-1 0, a titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) matrix reinforced with 10% by weight of titanium carbide particles. The PMMC was produced by a method of cold and hot isostatic pressing. This process blended the Ti-6Al-4V powder with the titanium carbide particles until a uniform distribution of particles was established. Then the blended mixture of matrix powder and particulate was subjected to cold isostatic pressing, followed then by a vacuum sintering. Then the sintered pre-form was hot isostatically pressed. This last process made use of high temperature and pressure to produce the full density of the material. After hot isostatic pressing, the material was furnace cooled. Complete test specimens contained small amounts of porosity and particle clustering. The small amounts of bulk defects did not

effectively change the perception of the material from having a uniform particle distribution and to idealize the material as isotropic. Fatigue tests conducted [58] were performed at 538°C in an air environment. The testing

apparatus used was a servocontrolled MTS axial-torsion mechanical machine. Tests 1 and 2 were subjected to fully reversed cyclic loading with a strain range of 1 % with a strain rate of

8.3 x lo-ss- 1 . The criterion for failure considered during testing of this material, aside from
complete fracture, was based on the concept of a crack propagating to a given size. For the fully reversed case, failure can be seen as the drop in maximum stress that is not matched by that of the minimum stress. During uniaxial cyclic fatigue tests, the drop in maximum stress was

effectively followed by complete rupture of the material. Therefore failure of the material during uniaxial tests was considered at the point where this maximum stress dropped. For the biaxial tubular specimen tests, failure was seen when the peak tensile stress reduced my more than 50% with a developing cusp on the compression side of the hysteresis loop. For the torsion tests, an

72

analogous rule was applied to determine specimen failure. Tests 3 and 4 are also pure tensile cyclic fatigue tests, however, test 3 was conducted with a strain ratio of 0.6% and strain rate of 8.3

x 10-ss- 1 while test 4 was conducted with a strain ratio of 1% and a strain rate of 8.3 x

10- 6 s- 1 . Tests 14 and 15 were subjected to a strain-controlled cyclic loading in pure torsion. Both tests were conducted at a controlled shear strain ratio of 1.2% and strain rate of 8.3 x 10-ss- 1 . Lastly, test 16 was subjected to a 90° out-of-phase axial-torsion cyclic fatigue test. The axial and shear strain ranges were, respectively, 0.7% and 1.2%, and the strain rates in tension and torsion were set at 5.9 x 10-ss- 1 and 10.2 x 10-ss-1, respectively. Figures 5.4a-d represents stress-fatigue life data of the four different PMMC materials under various uniaxial and multiaxial fatigue loading conditions studied in this thesis.

5.3. Results of Fatigue Damage Assessment
This section presents fatigue damage assessment of various PMMCs tested under various fatigue loading conditions using the most popular damage approaches including Smith-Watson-Topper, Brown-Miller, Fatemi-Socie, and Ellyin. The Varvani critical plane-energy damage approach will be thoroughly outlined in chapter 6. Material characteristics and calculated damage results based on various approaches are tabulated in Tables presented in Appendix A. 5.3.1. Smith-Watson-Topper Damage Assessment Smith-Watson-Topper damage parameter is determined by accounting for the mean stress effect during the strain-life approach. This section will examine the capability of the S.W.T. damage parameter to assess fatigue damage of components subjected to pure tension, torsion, and combined tension-torsion fatigue loading conditions.

Figure 5.4: Stress-Life data for the four PMMC materials examined in this thesis [46,56,57,58].

This fatigue damage parameter was developed based on the components of the strain amplitude (llc/2) and the maximum normal stress (lTmax) obtained from the Mohr's circles. For torsion fatigue loading, S.W.T. damage parameter becomes the product of the shear strain amplitude
(fly /2) and the maximum shear stress (Tmax)·

For the multiaxial fatigue loading case, the

damage parameter is calculated by the summation of the two products mentioned above for both the shear and tensile damage components.

5.3.2. Critical Plane Damage Assessment

Both Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie critical plane damage models were evaluated using four sets ofmultiaxial fatigue life data reported in the literature [45,56,57,58] . Recall that the critical plane damage model is based on physics of material damage along the crystallographic planes where the maximum resolved shear stress is achieved. For damage assessment based on FatemiSocie critical plane model, the maximum shear stress and its corresponding maximum normal stress on the maximum shear plane are required. For Brown-Miller's approach, both the normal and shear strain components acting on the critical plane should be calculated first. Equations (4.2) and (4.3) respectively represent Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie approaches. The procedure of damage analysis based on both Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie critical plane damage approaches are presented in a flowchart shown in figure 5.10.

5.3.3. Ellyin's Energy Damage Assessment

Damage assessment based on Ellyin's energy model [57] is a measure of materials damage in a component as cyclic plastic deformation is accumulated over fatigue cycles. Both the plastic and elastic strain components and their corresponding stress components of the stress-strain hysteresis loops are required to calculate the elastic and plastic strain energies for the material subjected to fatigue loads. This approach characterizes fatigue damage based on the integrated elastic and plastic energies generated in the material during fatigue cycles. The procedure of damage analysis based on Ellyin's energy parameter is outlined in figure 5.19.

Fatigue Model for PMMC Developed Based on Approach
6.1. Strain-Life in PMMCs

Cri~ical

Plane-Energy

It is well documented that PMMCs show lowered fatigue strength than the base metallic matrices

[59,60,61]. Reinforced particles are prone to an early fracture when metal matrix composites experience cyclic stress, resulting in crack initiation and damage progress within the metallic matrix. Brittle reinforced particles of SiC, Ah03, and TiC are intermetallic materials dispersed within the matrix and act as stress raisers where the crack initiation most likely takes place. Distributed particles occupy countless positions within the metallic matrix leading degradation of composite materials integrity against failure when subjected to fatigue. Figure 6.1 compares typical strain-fatigue life diagram of an AI 6061 I Ah03 I 20p PMM composite and an AI 6061 as the matrix material. This figure shows that at any given cyclic strain magnitude, AI 6061- Ah03 composite material shows shorter fatigue life as compared with the fatigue life of the metallic matrix at the same strain magnitude.

6.2. Coffin-Manson Relation for PMMCs
The Coffin-Manson relation has been employed to evaluate fatigue life of metal-matrix composites through extensive studies by [63,64,65]. Coffin-Manson equation characterizes

fatigue life (2N1 ) of components based on the cyclic elastic strain (l1ce/2) and the plastic strain

and material properties

(a[, E, E; , b, and c). Traditional Coffin-Manson equation for

metallic materials is expressed as:

6.4. Fatigue Damage Approach
Degradation of fatigue strength in PMM composites is very much due to reinforcement material, de bonding of particle-matrix interface, and early fracture of brittle particles under cyclic loads. This highlights the necessity of material constants in fatigue damage approaches. Damage approaches of S.W.T., Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie lack a full involvement of material coefficients or constants and the coefficients of these approaches are not determined readily. Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie approaches are defined either in terms of stress

components or strain components acting on the critical plane, and fail to present a rigorous model based on fundamentals of continuum mechanics. Smith-Watson-Topper (S.W.T.) and Ellyin Energy approaches however contribute both stress and strain components in damage assessment of materials. S.W.T. calculates the amount of energy during loading on the maximum shear plane while Ellyin's energy approach calculates energy from the cyclic stress-strain hysteresis loop during each fatigue cycle. Ellyin's energy is 93

quantified from the area within the cyclic hysteresis loops and excludes the fact that damage is a vector with a certain direction. Ellyin's damage model includes both the normal energy and the shear energy with an equal weight, and involves no material dependent coefficients. The Varvani critical plane-energy approach [38] was developed to overcome shortcomings of the hysteresis energy approach and the critical plane approach. The critical plane-energy approach weights both the normal and the shear energies by the corresponding normal and shear fatigue properties. Components of the normal and shear energies on this model are calculated from stresses and strains acting on the critical plane of maximum shear stress. For metallic materials, Varvani's approach [38] is expressed as:

(6.5)

Equation (6.5) due to its broadness and inclusion of the normal and shear stress/strain components and more importantly weighting the normal and shear energies respectively with the normal and shear fatigue properties is qualified for damage assessment of PMM composites. The equation (6.6) for damage assessment of PMM composite is extended as:

(6.6)

94

6.5. Damage Assessment
Varvani critical plane-energy model integrates both the normal and shear energy ranges which is calculated directly from the critical plane. Varvani critical-plane damage parameter incorporates both the normal and shear stress and strain components. The model includes the contribution of both shear and normal components in damage of materials under cyclic loads by normalizing them using material fatigue parameters. This model also takes into account the effect of mean stress and includes the effect of strain-hardening for out-of-phase loading conditions. The procedure of damage assessment based on Varvani' s critical approach is outlined in figure 6.4.

Figure 6.9 verifies good agreements of the experimental and predicted fatigue life results. The predicted lives and the experimental fatigue life for tension, torsion and combined tensiontorsion loading conditions fall between the upper and lower bounds within a factor of ±3. Of the three life data sets presented in figure 6.9, the Al6061 I Ah03 I 22p-T6 material shows the predicted and the experimental data along the 45° dashed line representing the best correlations.

Chapter 7 Discussion of Results
7.1. Stress-Strain Response using FE Analysis
Finite element analysis performed in chapter 3 of this thesis evaluated stress-strain data reported by Lease [29]. FE analysis employed the unit cell element model [5,66,67] and achieved

numerical results of stress versus strain which were found in good agreement with experimental stress-strain data by Lease [29] . The 3D PMM composite unit cell model was also applied to compare the elastic-plastic experimental stress-strain response of Al 60611 Ah0 3 11 Op-T6 and Al 60611 Ah0 3 /20p-T6 composites [29]. To develop the 3D unit cell model, the elastic-plastic properties of both the metallic matrix and the reinforcement in the Ansys materials library are accurately set. The Ah0 3 particle was considered perfectly elastic to fracture, where as the Al 6061 metallic matrix was considered elastic-plastic. As inputs of FE model the elastic modulus of Al 6061 and Ah0 3 particles and their corresponding stress and strain data are required. Ansys workbench material library allowed for the plastic stress-strain response by using a multi-linear plasticity model. This is a built in Multilinear Isotropic Hardening model in Ansys that uses the von Mises yield criterion coupled with an isotropic work hardening assumption. This model is not suited for cyclic or highly non-proportional load histories in small-strain analyses. It is however recommended for large non-cyclic strain analysis, which is preferred for the PMM composite simulations. Simulated results of stress-strain by Ansys generated for PMM composites under uniaxial loading were found in good agreement with the experimental stress-strain data reported in reference [29]. A comparison of FE results and experimental data showed that elastic strain102

stress possessed the same slope, while plastic strain-stress data presented a difference of 10% in magnitude. There are several assumptions that are used in the development of the 3D unit cell model that would inevitably lead to errors in the elastic-plastic simulated response of the PMM composite materials. The discontinuous PMM composite was firstly idealized as a single unit cell. This assumes that there are no material defects and the particle remains perfectly bonded to the matrix during loading. This model also neglects to consider the possibility of particle clusters in the metallic matrix. With these assumptions, the numerical models elastic-plastic stress-strain

response stayed within a reasonable difference in mechanical properties. The results could have been improved by the use of smaller elements at the critical location of particle-matrix interface. These improvements to the mesh would have led to a clearer stress-strain response of the material during plastic deformation; however, computer processing time was a constraint that had to be kept to a minimum during simulated numerical analysis.

7.2. Fatigue Damage Models Assessment and their Capabilities
7.2.1. Mean Stress Effect The results of fatigue life are lower in the presence of tensile mean stress and higher in the presence of compressive mean stress [68]. The fatigue life testing of the AI 6061 I SiC I 17w-T6 was conducted with a tensile mean stress ratio of (R=0.1). The other three fatigue life data were conducted with the stress ration R =-1 (zero mean stress). The capability of the fatigue damage approaches used in this thesis to account for the effect of mean stress was studied. S.W.T. damage model due to its maximum stress component ( CTmax 103

= CTmean + CTamp),

takes into

account the effect of mean stress in damage assessment of materials. Ellyin's energy damage model incorporates the effect of mean stress due to the components of stress range and strain range (ie., lla

= amin- amax)·

Fatemi-Socie critical plane damage model included a mean

stress correlation factor of the maximum value of normal stress during a cycle to modify the damage parameter. Varvani' s critical plane-energy damage assessment model showed an analogous mean stress correlation in fatigue damage assessment of materials, where the mean stress acted normal to the critical plane.

7.2.2. Strain Hardening Effect

Under non-proportional loading, the principal stress and strain axes rotate during fatigue loading often causing additional cyclic hardening of materials. A change of loading direction allows
, I

more grains to undergo their most favourable orientation for slip, and leads to more active slip systems in producing dislocation interactions and dislocation tangles to form dislocation cells. Interactions strongly affect the hardening behaviour and as the degree of non proportionality increases, the numbers of active slip systems increases. The higher magnitude of strain and stress ranges in the non-proportional tests was due to the effect of an additional strain hardening in the material. During out-of-phase straining, the magnitude of the normal strain and stress ranges is larger than that for in-phase straining with the same applied shear strain ranges per cycle. Strain hardening effect can be well-described from cyclic stress-strain hysteresis loops. This makes both as

Ellyin's and Varvani' s energy based models qualified to account this effect in the damage assessment of materials under cyclic loads. While strain-based/ stress-based parameters fail to

104

take into account this effect. Varvani' s damage parameter via its stress and strain ranges increases with the additional hardening caused by non-proportional dependent hardening.

7.2.3. Continuum Mechanics Fundamentals in Models

Critical plane damage parameters developed earlier based on stress or strain components including Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie have been criticized for lack of adherence to rigorous continuum mechanics fundamentals. To compensate this, the energy criteria including both

stress and strain terms in conjunction with the critical plane approach were developed. One of the most recent damage models of this type was introduced by Varvani [38]. The model is given by the sum of the normal energy range and the shear energy range calculated from the critical plane at which the stress and strain Mohr's circles are the largest during loading and unloading parts of the cycle. Multiaxial fatigue energy models have been long discussed in terms of normal and shear energy weights. In Guard's approach [69] he found that an empirical weighting factor of C=0.5 in the shear energy part of his model gave a good correlation of multiaxial fatigue results for 1% CrMo-V steel for both in-phase and out-of-phase loading conditions. Tipton [70] found that a good multiaxial fatigue life correlation was obtained for 1045 steel with a scaling factor C of 0.90. Andrews [71] found that a C factor of 0.30 yielded the best

..

correlation of multiaxiallife data for AISI 316 stainless steel. Chu et al. [72] weighted the shear energy part of their formulation by a factor of C=2 to obtain a good correlation of fatigue results. Liu's [73] and Glinka et al. 's [74] formulations provided an equal weight to normal and shear energies. The empirical factors (C) suggested by each of the authors gave a good fatigue life 105

correlation for a specific material which suggests that the empirical weighting factor C is material dependent. In the present study, the proposed model correlates multiaxial fatigue lives by normalizing the normal and shear energies using the axial and shear material fatigue properties, respectively, and hence the parameter used no empirical weighting factors.

7.3. Damage Assessment ofPMMC's based on Damage Models
Fully reversed fatigue damage data of Al60611 Ab0 3 I 20p-T6, Al60611 Ab03 122p-T6 and Al 6061 I SiC I 17w-T6 composites were evaluated based on various damage models discussed in this thesis including the modified damage model by Varvani. The Ti-6Al-4V I TiC I lOp PMM composite fatigue life data was excluded due to its different metal matrix and its heat treatment other than T6.

.,

·,

Both S.W.T. and Ellyin damage approaches resulted in a wider scatter band when compared with the other three damage approaches of Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie critical plane, and Varvani's critical-plane-energy. At high cycle fatigue regime, figure 7.1 presents a decreasing trend and a more unified data for both the critical plane and critical plane-energy approaches. At low cycle regime, Ellyin's and the S.W.T. models correlate the fatigue damage data with life in a more unified fashion than that at high-cycle fatigue regime. At high-cycle fatigue regime, composite materials undergo elastic deformation dominantly, and non-linear response (plastic) deformation of materials during cyclic loads is minimized.

Fatigue Life (Cycles)

Figure 7.1: Fatigue damage models versus fatigue lives for Al6061 I Ah0 3I lOP-T6, Al6061 I Ah03 I 20P-T6, and AI 6061 I SiC I 17W-T6 composites tested under various uniaxial and multiaxialloading conditions.

·

The critical plane-energy assessments show a stronger correlation in predicting the fatigue damage of three Al6061 based composites during uniaxial, shear, and multiaxial fatigue loading conditions at the low-cycle and the high-cycle fatigue regimes. This may suggest that fatigue tensile and shear properties in Varvani 's approach weights both the shear and normal energies, while other damage models are not balanced for their shear and normal stress/strain components. Damage assessment based on Brown-Miller and Fatemi-Socie approaches resulted in fairly unified collapsed damage-life data at high cycle fatigue region. While damage data at shorter fatigue lives scattered when evaluated by the critical plane approaches. Brown-Miller and

107

Fatemi-Socie approaches both require constants which are determined from fatigue life testing. These constants stay unchanged for each material and loading condition. Varvani critical plane-energy approach (shown in figure 7.1) correlates fatigue damage of PMM composite materials over life cycles under uniaxial and multiaxial loading conditions. This

damage approach unifies fatigue damage data over high-cycle and low-cycle fatigue regions. The reason for such fair assessment lies within the model itself. Since the critical plane-energy model incorporates the effects of mean stress, cyclic hardening, material dependent parameters, and contribution of the shear and normal energies in damage of composite materials under cyclic loads. To include the effect of the shear and normal fatigue properties in PMM composites, two terms of a and

Bwere introduced in the damage model.

7.4. The Effect of Particle Volume Fraction
Two materials of Al 60611 Ab0 3 /20p-T6 and Al 60611 Ab0 3 /22p-T6 consist of volume fractions

(v1 )

20% and 22%, respectively, were evaluated under tensile and torsional fatigue

loading conditions. The comparison of these two volume fractions may highlight the influence of V r on the decreasing trend of D-N curves. Figures 7.2 and 7.3 show the slopes D-N data for composites with volume fractions of 20% and 22% tested under uniaxial and torsional fatigue, respectively.

Figure 7.2 displays the decreasing trend (the slope) of D-N curves for various composite materials tested under uniaxial loading conditions. The results of the slopes of these curves are summarized in Table 7 .1. Values listed in this table shows that except Ellyin's approach, other damage approaches show a small or no differences between the slopes of D-N curves for composite samples with the volume fraction of 20% and 22% tested under uniaxial loading conditions. Table 7.2 however list slopes of D-N curves resulted from torsional fatigue tests of composites with 20% and 22% Ab0 3particles. Except for Brwon-Miller approach, the slopes in this table show an increasing trend as particle percentage increases. This verifies the fact that the effect of particle volume percentage of MMP composites is more pronounced when components are tested under torsional loading conditions. A higher value of slope corresponds to a steeper DN curve and therefore a smaller range for predicted fatigue lives. These results indicate that the greater volume fraction of Ab0 3 particles reduces the fatigue life of the PMM composites tested under torsional loading condition. This response is evident from fatigue life data of PMM composites collected from literature which show more damaging response is reported for composites tested under torsional loading, where Ab03 particles are detached from Al6061 matrix.

Conclusions and Future Research Recommendations

8.1. Conclusions

Fatigue damage of various particle-reinforced metal matrix composites subjected to uniaxial and multiaxialloading conditions have been studied. Composite materials studied in this thesis are Al 6061 I Ah03 I 20p-T6, Al 6061 I Ah03 I 22p-T6, Al 6061 I SiC I 17w-T6, and Ti-6Al-4V I TiC I lOp. The fatigue damage models of Smith-Watson-Topper, Brown-Miller, Fatemi-Socie, Ellyin, and Varvani were used to evaluate fatigue damage over fatigue life of components tested under tensile, torsion, and combined tension-torsion fatigue loading conditions. Over both the lowcycle and high-cycle fatigue regimes, Smith-Watson-Topper approach and Ellyin energy model resulted in a wide scatter range of correlated damage data. Both critical plane models of BrownMiller and Fatemi-Socie on the other hand collapsed the same fatigue damage data in a reasonably narrower band under uniaxial and multiaxial loading conditions. Fatigue damage model of Varvani successfully correlated fatigue damage in the various loading conditions. Varvani critical plane-energy model is the latest approach incorporating the effects of strain hardening, mean stress, and also material dependent fatigue parameters in damage assessment of materials. Material dependent parameters in this damage approach, enabled an accurate damage assessment of PMMCs as the effect of the shear and normal fatigue properties was accounted in the damage model by means of a and

A single cylindrical shell of metallic matrix AI 6061 with a single spherical ceramic particle Ah0 3 located in the middle of the cylinder was considered.

8.2. Future Recommendations
Further research into the fatigue damage assessment of PMM composites 1s necessary as literature lacks to address vanous mechanical phenomena, including fatigue response of PMMCs. An extensive amount of fatigue damage data is required to accurately characterize fatigue damage of PMM composites at various conditions including operating temperature, volume fraction of reinforced particles, particle size and shape, and the interface bonding between matrix and particle. Further investigation is essential to find the effect of loading type, loading spectrum, mean stress, environmental and moisture on fatigue damage of this class of composites. Fatigue life prediction methods based on damage accumulation of microconstituants of PMM composites are yet to be developed. This needs extensive fatigue tests and material modeling.
