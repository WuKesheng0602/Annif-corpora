Abstract
  Supersonic Wind Tunnel Noise Attenuation  Master of Applied Science, 2012  William Wai Lim Wong   Aerospace Engineering  Ryerson University    The aerodynamic generated noise in the supersonic wind tunnel during operation at Ryerson University  has exceeded the threshold of hearing damage. An acoustic silencer was to be designed and added to  the wind tunnel to reduce the noise level.     The main sources of noise generated from the wind tunnel with the silencer were identified to be  located at the convergent divergent nozzle and the turbulent region downstream of the shock wave at  the diffuser with the maximum acoustic power level of the entire wind tunnel at 161.09 dB. The  designed silencer provided an overall sound pressure level reduction of 21.41 db which was considered  as acceptable.     Refinement to the mesh size and changes to the geometry of the mixing chamber was suggested for a  more accurate result in noise output as well as flow conditions would match up to the physical flow.  Additional acoustic treatment should be applied to the wind tunnel to further reduce sound pressure  level since the noise level still exceeded the threshold of hearing loss.

1 Introduction
  Supersonic wind tunnels have been used for decades in research facilities and are still used due to  limitations in the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The first supersonic wind tunnel was  located in Peenemünde Army Research Center in Germany in 1936 (6). Most of the supersonic wind  tunnels used were for military applications such as the development of missiles, fighter jets, and space  vehicles.     There are multiple configurations of supersonic wind tunnels. The supersonic wind tunnel in Ryerson  University is an open circuit blowdown type. This type of supersonic wind tunnel is used for transonic  and supersonic flow tests. Gas is stored in a high pressure storage tank. When in operation, the gas is  released into a settling chamber then through an expansion nozzle to accelerate the flow to supersonic  in the test section and past a diffuser to release into the atmosphere. The test section Mach number is  dependent on the area ratio of the nozzle and the temperature and pressure of the gas. The advantages  of a blowdown wind tunnel are lower capital cost and ease of start up. The disadvantages are short run  times and noisy operation (7).        Noise is major problem for the operation of supersonic wind tunnel. Excessive noise can cause hearing  loss. Noise is also considered a nuisance to the surrounding community and is subject to city regulations.  The Ryerson University campus is located in the downtown of a major city and is susceptible to noise  complaints which could place limitations on the use of the wind tunnel. At the moment, without any  acoustic treatment applied to the wind tunnel, the noise is perceived to be intolerable. As a result, a  simple and effective acoustic treatment is needed to minimize the impact to the occupants of the  building as well as the surrounding community.    There have been research and publications about noise reduction for supersonic wind tunnel test  section. Much of the research focused on the expansion nozzle wall design and treatment.  The focus of  this research was to design an acoustic treatment aft of the diffuser. Commercial CFD package was used  to determine the optimal configuration of this treatment and estimate the resulting sound pressure  level of the wind tunnel.

2 Background
 

2.1 SourceofNoise
The main source of noise in supersonic wind tunnels is generated from the turbulent boundary layer  along the jet nozzle wall, which is difficult to control (8). Aerodynamic noise is associated with high  speed and or unsteady gas flow interaction with solid object. There are three main sources of  aerodynamic noise. A monopole is present when heat or mass is added to a fluid flow at an unsteady  rate. The generated pulse spreads in a spherical pattern. A dipole is present when a flow interacts with a  solid body. This creates two poles close to one another, less than a wavelength apart and in different  phase. A quadrupole occurs due to the viscous stress in the flow that exists in pairs to cancel out the  forces. Quadrupoles are the main source of noise in high speed, turbulent, subsonic flow and have a  great strength in regions with high meanvelocity and turbulent gradients.     The flow in the wind tunnel becomes supersonic when the ratio of the stagnation pressure to the outlet  pressure is 1.89. The noise source is from turbulent mixing in the shear layer. High frequency noise  radiates near the nozzle wall where eddies are small and lower frequency noise is radiated further  downstream where the size of the eddy increases.     Morkovin identified that noise is generated from the quadrupole and dipole radiation from the  turbulent boundary layer and the fluctuation in position of the Mach waves generated from surface  finishes (9). Factors identified that would affect the boundary layer transition near the nozzle wall  include wall roughness, wall temperature, upstream suction, and settling chamber disturbances. The  generated noise travels along the Mach line in supersonic flow which propagats towards the diffuser  and exhausts into the atmosphere (10). Additional noise can be originated from the compressor if no  noise control is present before the compressed gas is fed into the expansion jet nozzle.      



2   

2.2 SolutionstoNoiseReduction
The only solution to eliminate the noise source at the nozzle wall is to maintain a laminar boundary layer  along the whole wind tunnel wall. However, this has yet to be achieved. Many solutions to control the  noise in high speed flow have been proposed in journal papers and some are used in practise. They are  divided into two categories: active and passive. Active control generally involves injection of external  energy to the flow while passive control generally controls the flow via alterations in the geometry of  the duct.    2.2.1 Benchmark   The University of Toronto has an undergraduate supersonic laboratory that is also in an open circuit and  operates at Mach 1.6. In the wind tunnel layout, the diffuser is placed in an acoustic enclosure  separated by a wall in another room as seen in Figure 1. There is a 20 hp 3 phase motor driving a  vacuum pump that increases the pressure aft of the diffuser to minimize back pressure due to pressure  head. The gas goes through a muffler with a series of baffles and then exhausted to outdoors.     The supersonic wind tunnel at University of Texas at Arlington has the flow exhaust into a large sphere  from the diffuser as seen in Figure 2. A large tube is connected with the sphere which leads the flow into  a large silencer.

The NASA Glenn 8 by 6 foot supersonic wind tunnel in Cleveland had a muffler installed after noise  complaints from the surrounding community. The Glenn wind tunnel consists of 5 Helmholtz resonators  at the diffuser to absorb noise in the 5 to 11Hz band as seen in Figure 3. In the muffler region, there are  6 parallel ducts with each having a 62 feet resonator used to attenuate the 12 to 20 Hz noise band. The  resonator is then followed by a 90 feet section of 6 inch thick fibreglass panel in a 2 feet cavity that was  designed to attenuate the 20 to 800 Hz band(13).

2.2.2 NozzleWallTreatment One of the methods to reduce noise is to reduce or eliminate the source. Multiple papers had been  published on the development of quiet supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnel at NASA for reducing test  section noise. The focus of these papers had been on the expansion nozzle wall design in an attempt to  delay the transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent.   2.2.2.1 SuctionPort One technique is to create a suction port in the convergent section of the nozzle before the thrat. The  suction port would remove the turbulent boundary layer from the settling chamber near the wall so that  a new laminar boundary layer would be formed further downstream at the nozzle wall right after the  throat. Research found disturbances from the settling chamber upstream would travel through the  nozzle and enter into the test section. The disturbances would increase the Reynold's number  downstream and a turbulent boundary layer along the nozzle wall would develop sooner which would  5   

generate more noise (8). In theory, the suction port had great potential, however, in physical  application, it was hindered by nonuniform suction as well as surface roughness. As a result, Langley had  abandoned this approach in the 1970s (9).   2.2.2.2 MaintainSurfaceFinishofNozzle Anders et al. also discussed about the surface finish of the convergent divergent nozzle. Since the free stream unit Reynold's number decreases as the Mach number increases, the stagnation pressure must  increase in order to increase the unit Reynold's number in the test section. However, since the thickness  of the boundary layer is inversely proportional to the square root of the unit Reynold's number, the  boundary layer at the throat wall would be thin (14). As a result, the boundary layer would be sensitive  to the surface finish. The surface finish should have a tolerance in the range of 0.001 ­ 0.002 inches (14).  A polished nozzle wall has an increase of 30% in the transitional Reynold's number, when turbulent  eddies begin to form. However, cleaning and polishing of the nozzle wall would be required in order to  maintain the performance. An increase in temperature of the nozzle wall also increass the transition  Reynold's number by 20% compared to a nozzle wall at room temperature. The boundary layer  thickness would increase while the flow's sensitivity to the wall roughness would decrease (8).     2.2.3 Silencer Other approach to reduce noise impact by the supersonic wind tunnel is to apply a silencer to the  exhaust of the wind tunnel.  The most common types of silencer are dissipative silencer and resonators.  Dissipative silencers use sound absorptive material that converts sound energy into heat. The resonator  reflects sound waves back to the source to create a destructive interference like a Helmholtz resonator.  Resonators are designed to supress noise at a particular frequency so that it is only effective for narrow  frequency band. Dissipative silencer on the other hand can attenuate noise in a broader frequency range  but it is more effective in the mid to high frequency ranges. As a result, most silencers and like the one  employed at the NASA Glenn research facility have a combination of the two silencer types to reduce  noise across the whole hearing frequency range.     2.2.4 CurvedBaffle Curved baffles in the duct as seen in Figure 4 would be one of the more effective techniques to decrease  sound pressure level by blocking the line of sight (15). An insertion loss of 5 dB in the low frequency and  10 dB in the high frequency band could be achieved with a curved baffle as seen in Figure 5.

2.2.5 PlasmaActuators The use of electric discharge plasma has been studied but some mechanisms may not be practical for  high speed flows. Samimy et al. studied the thermal effects of hightemperature, highcurrent, nearwall  arc discharge (16). They found a sudden temperature change created a spike in local pressure in which  generated a shock wave that altered the supersonic flow. The application of plasma discharge in the  study showed a slight noise reduction in the range of 0.6dB to 1 dB measured 30°90° from the flow axis  over a range of Strouhal numbers (16).  2.2.6 TangentialJet A tangential jet injected into a supersonic flow to alter the shear layer structure has been experimented.  Luff et al studied the noise generation of flow with tangential flow injection through eight 4mm ports  upstream of the nozzle exit and eight 1.5mm diameter blowing jets at the nozzle exit. For the injectors  placed upstream of the nozzle, a 44% mass flow ratio resulted in the lowest sound pressure level  measured at angles between 60°90° from the flow axis with the greatest noise reduction of 3dB at 90°.  Between 15°60° from the flow axis, a mass flow ratio of 65% from the injectors provided the greatest  sound pressure level reduction. For the tangential jets at the nozzle exit, a mass flow ratio of greater  than 1.1% resulted in an increase of sound pressure level starting from 50° of the jet flow axis up to 90°.  A 11% mass flow ratio resulted in an average sound pressure level reduction of 2 dB. However, the  7   

drawback of this method would decrease the flow speed of the jet due to the acceleration of the flow in  the tangential direction agitated by the injection of tangential jet (17).  2.2.7 VacuumBubbles There was a research on the potential use of vacuum bubbles for noise and vibration attenuation. The  concept was developed by Dr. Bschorr (18). The vacuum bubbles were made of a thin metallic shell with  a cavity that was in vacuum as seen in Figure 6. The vacuum bubbles were designed as an alternative to  the Helmholtz resonator and one of its advantages was taking up less space than a resonator of  equivalent performance. The drawback of vacuum bubble was it would be expensive to acquire and the  bubbles would require precision during manufacturing due to sensitivity in performance from material  to static pressure. The function of the vacuum bubble was to act as a spring where the shell must be  statically stiff and yet dynamically soft. The shell profile of the bubble would be in the form of an arc.  When exposed to pressure load, the shell would deform and push in but strong enough from fracture  (18) as seen in Figure 6.

2.2.8 PerforatedLiners Perforated liners with an array of opening equally spaced apart have been applied for noise reduction in  many applications such as automotive muffler and turbofan engine. The moving air in the duct and the  still air in the resonator generate a shear layer (19). Studies have found that the acoustic resistance,  8   

where the acoustic energy is transformed into other form of energy, increases linearly with the main  flow speed. However, for low speed flow from 0 ­ 24 m/s, the shear layer would grow exponentially due  to KelvinHelmholtz instabilities and oscillate. This in effect creates a source of noise increasing the  sound pressure level in the duct. Studies have concluded perforated liners suppress noise by two  mechanisms depending on the acoustic intensity. Viscous dissipation as a result of wall friction due to  the presence of the holes is responsible for the suppression of lower sound pressure level up to 140dB  (20).  The vortex shed from the upstream circumference of the holes is the main mechanism for  suppression of high sound pressure level. The acoustic energy is transferred into the kinetic energy of  the vortices.    2.2.9 ObliquePerforation The acoustic performance of several oblique perforate pattern at different oblique angles, porosity, and  hole diameter were studied by Khan et al. for applications to high thrust turbojet engine (21). The  experiments revealed a forward facing angle oblique perforated pattern had better acoustic  performance compared to normal angle and backward facing angle. The forward facing angle pattern  showed via high speed video camera that the shock structures from the outlet of the base tube without  perforated pattern had been eliminated. This reduced the broadband noise from the jet and eliminated  jet screech. However at low pressure ratio between two and three when measured at 90° to the flow  axis, the forward facing angle pattern displayed a discrete tone where the overall sound pressure level  was greater than the other perforated patterns. This was resolved by trimming the inner sharp edge of  each hole as seen in Figure 7 but would result in decrease in acoustic performance for pressure ratio of  4 and higher.   

  Figure 7: Forward facing perforate pattern with inner edge trimmed (21).

2.2.10 Tabs Broadband associated noise and jet screech are caused by unstable waves interacting with shockcell  structure. Jet screech occurs in under expanded supersonic condition and result in a spike in sound  pressure level for a discrete tone over a certain range of pressure ratio. As the sonic flow is exhausted, it  expands and then contracts back to its original size over a specific distance depending on the pressure  ratio. During the contraction, conical shock waves are formed growing upstream towards the exit nozzle.  This phenomenon is repeated several times forming a cellular pattern, as seen in Figure 8, until the  repetition is halted due to turbulent mixing with the ambient air (22). Jet screech has the potential to  weaken an object structurally (23). 

 
Figure 8: Shock structure downstream of nozzle without tabs (24). 

Experiments have found the placement of small intrusion of rectangular tabs at the end of the nozzle  exits suppressed the screech and hence reduced the jet noise due to the alteration in the shock wave  structure downstream of the exit as seen in Figure 9.  

 
Figure 9: Shock structure downstream of nozzle with rectangular tabs (24). 

However, the centreline velocity decreased as a result of the attachment of tabs to the nozzle (25). Later  studies revealed triangular or delta shaped tabs tilted downstream provided better performance than  their rectangular shaped counterparts.  

2.3 ComputationalAeroacoustics
The use of computational simulation to calculate acoustic performance is a relatively new development  due to computational hardware limits in the past. The two main source of aerodynamic noise are  impulsive and turbulence. Impulsive noise occurs due to a moving body in a fluid flow or unsteady  aerodynamic loads acting on a stationary surface. The unsteady aerodynamic loads create pressure  fluctuations that radiate sound. Impulsive noise can be easily predicted with numerical simulation. The  10   

other noise source is from turbulence which occurs in many scenarios. Noise from turbulence has a  broad band spectrum and turbulent energy converts most efficiently into acoustic energy at sharp  edges. Like turbulent aerodynamic simulations in CFD, noise from turbulence is difficult to simulate  accurately. The most common techniques include direct numerical simulation (DNS), Reynoldsaveraged  NavierStokes (RANS), or largeeddy simulation (LES). Since CFD modelling of turbulence is not perfect,  accurate modelling would require specific setup for each individual case. There is a large disparity in the  energy, length, and time scales between aeroacoustics and aerodynamics. The acoustical energy is 4 to 9  magnitudes smaller than mechanical energy. As a result, the damping techniques in CFD to supress any  numerical noise would cancel out the acoustic energy in the simulation. Aeroacoustics is a time  dependent problem. For flows with a high Reynolds number, the turbulent eddy will be smaller and as a  result, a fine grid will be required. A large simulation domain is required since sound travels over a  distance. As a result, the simulation would require greater computer resource that is available to small  number of organizations.     Fluent in Ansys 13.0 was the commercial CFD package used for this research. There are two acoustics  model available within Fluent: Segregated Sourcepropagation Method, which is the FfowcsWilliams &  Hawking (FW&H) Model, and Stochastic Noise Generation and Radiation, which is the Broadband Noise  Model.  The physics behind the acoustics code used in Fluent is based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy.  Lighthill's analogy solves the acoustic problem in two parts. The first part is the noise generation from  the fluid flow. The second part is the noise propagation in a medium at rest due to external fluctuations  (26).        Lighthill's equation of aerodynamic noise is based on Navier Stokes and continuity equations without  the gravitational source term (26).                0     (2.1)  (2.2)  (2.3)  (2.4)  (2.5) 

Subtracting the divergence of equation 2.2 from the time derivative of equation 2.1 and add the identity  of equation 2.3 and the relations of equations 2.4 and 2.5 would yield (26):  

11   

    

(2.6)  (2.7) 

Lighthill has transformed the governing equation of the fluid flow into a wave equation format.     A third method exists in Fluent to simulate the generation and propagation of noise using the CAA  method, essentially the same concept as DNS. As mentioned above, this would require a fine spatial grid  and small time step size for which the hardware resources are unavailable and thus cannot be done.     The FW&H model is used to predict noise transmitted into the far field using an integral method. The  aerodynamics of the flow is solved using one of the viscous models in Fluent and the flow field variables  are then used to predict the noise generated from the flow. The sound pressure history at a receiver  location would be computed using surface and volume integrals. The Broadband Noise Source Model is  used for turbulent flows where there is no distinct tone across the entire frequency band. This model  uses turbulence quantities from turbulence model, semiempirical correlations, and Lighthill's analogy  for analysis of the noise source. This model is mainly used to determine the prominent noise generating  region and also compare different design in noise generation. This model can be used in steady state  and thus is less hardware intensive of the two models available. However, unlike FW&H, this model  cannot calculate noise propagation. The FW&H model, according to the Fluent user guide, states it  should only be used for propagation of sound to free space and should not be used in duct or enclosed  space (27). It will not model sound reflection off solid boundary correctly and the source to the receiver  must be in a straight line. This model is also only available in transient simulations.     Since the propagation of sound is important in the design, both methods would be used during the  design process. Even though the Fluent user guide stated the FW&H model is not applicable to internal  flows, a validation study was conducted to determine whether FW&H model should be used.

3 ValidationandMeshSensitivityAnalysis
3.1 MeshSensitivity
A mesh analysis was performed to determine the appropriate cell size for the simulation of the final  design based on the concept of Richardson extrapolation. The idea is that using a systematically refined  mesh, the convergence rate of the mesh refinement discretization could be used to estimate the exact  solution to the model (28). The model used for the mesh analysis included the supersonic tunnel with a  silencer attached to the diffuser. The silencer in the model consisted of a 16 gauge perforated plate with  0.5 inch hole diameter and 48% area opening. Inside the silencer was a porous sound absorbent  material of glass wool. Three simulations were required for Richardson extrapolation beginning with a  coarse mesh. Each cell volume would be 1/8th of the previous mesh size for the remaining two  simulations. The initial mesh size setting used was: minimum size 0.005m, maximum size 0.02m, and  maximum face size of 0.04m. The total number of nodes with an adapted boundary was 142,843 nodes.  The next case increased to 977,087 nodes and then 3,276,930. The physical model and boundary  conditions in each case were the same. The areaweighted average absolute pressure, Mach number,  and acoustic power level were measured at two locations downstream, at x=2.7m named planeA, as  seen in Figure 10, and at the outlet. The results are found in Table A1 of Appendix A. The maximum  acoustic power level (APL) was also measured for each case since that would be dominant measure of  noise heard in the surrounding environment. The results are found in Table A2 of Appendix A. 

 
Figure 10: Location of planeA along wind tunnel.

APL is a measure of acoustic power of the source and is location independent. When APL is expressed in  dB, it is a ratio to a reference acoustic power of 1012 watts. SPL on the other hand is location dependent  and is a measure of acoustic pressure. When SPL is expressed in dB, it is a ratio to a reference acoustic  pressure of 2x105 Pa.       Using a series of data with a systematically reduced mesh size and applying Richardson extrapolation,  the APL of the wind tunnel configuration could be estimated to 3rd order accurate. The order of accuracy  is directly related to the number of data points available such that results with a mesh volume 1/4096th  of the initial size would be required for a 4th order accurate estimate. The simulation was conducted  with Ansys Fluent 13.0 running on a Dell T5500 computer in the Ryerson University Kerr Hall West 71B  computer lab. The 3rd order accurate estimation of areaweighted average APL at planeA was calculated  to be 118.17 dB and the maximum APL estimated was calculated to be 153.6269 dB. The calculations  could be seen in Appendix B. The areaweighted average APL at planeA with respect to the number of  nodes was plotted and shown in Figure 11 and the maximum acoustic power level with respect to the  number of nodes shown in Figure 12. Data from planeA was chosen over data from the outlet for the  extrapolation because the data from planeA would not be affected by the boundary conditions.

Figure 12: Maximum acoustic power level with increasing nodes. 

The APL from CFD and 3rd order estimation at planeA had a difference of 8.7219 dB or 7.38%. Looking at  the maximum APL, the analysis has reached an asymptote of approximately 159 dB but the 3rd order  estimate was lower at 153.35 dB. This was the result of one of the limitations of Richardson  extrapolation where a significant difference should exist for the variable of interest in between mesh  refinement. A further refinement was not pursued due to the number of mesh elements involved and  the lack of computing resources. The result from the last simulation was close to the estimated exact  solution of Richardson extrapolation.    

3.2 Validationandtimestep
The second step was to validate the accuracy of the results provided by Fluent and the size of the mesh  required for the latter simulations in the design process. This was accomplished by comparing with  experimental results.      The benchmark problem was the M219 cavity case which was a transonic flow over a cavity. This  benchmark problem had been used by multiple journal papers including the one by Li and Hamed (29).  The computing geometry used for validation is shown in Figure 13 where D is 4 inches. The sound  recorders were placed at locations indicated in Figure 14 at the midplane of the geometry.    

15   

 
Figure 13: Computation geometry of transonic flow over cavity (29). 

 
Figure 14: Location of sound receivers inside cavity (29). 

This particular problem was chosen as the benchmark because it would test the accuracy of sound  propagation and sound reflection off impermeable surfaces of the acoustics model available in Fluent.  The transonic flow would be similar to the flow velocity expected in the diffuser region of the wind  tunnel. Only the FW&H model could provide sound pressure level vs. frequency and thus it was used in  conjunction with DetachedEddy Simulation (DES) and realizable kepsilon as the viscous model to  determine the appropriate time step size that would yield results similar to the benchmark problem.   The generated mesh used an element size of 0.005m with refinement over the region of the cavity and  further refinement inside the cavity as seen in Figure 15.    

16   

 
Figure 15: Generated mesh of validation case. 

The boundary condition used for the inlet was farfield pressure inlet with a Mach number of 0.85 and  the outlet was a pressure outlet with gauge pressure of 0 Pa. The model was simulated with 2nd order  upwind spatial and temporal discretization and with a time step size of 0.00001 sec and 50,000  iterations. The acoustic data from the first 10,000 iterations were omitted due to the fluctuations during  the starting of the simulation. The sound pressure level from the simulation at the three recorders as  seen in Figure 16 to Figure 18 was compared with the experimental results in the blue coloured plot.

19   

Several observations were made from the results running on Fluent. The simulation did not replicate the  tone at 500 Hz in the experimental results. For frequencies greater than 1000 Hz, the general trend was  similar to the experimental data as well as the results of Li and Hamed. However, the result from Fluent  was approximately 2030 dB or 1827% lower than the experiment and Li and Hamed. The simulations  conducted by Li and Hamed (red and green plot in Figure 1618) yield closer results to the experimental  data using the WIND code from NASA. They also used a finer spatial grid size of 3.5 million grid points  and time step size of 8x107 sec as well as a third order discretization scheme. Based on the current  circumstances where only a low order discretization scheme is available, a computational resource limit  on the refinement of the mesh size, and an acoustic package with limitation on internal flow, an error of  1827% is considered acceptable for the purpose of this study. The FW&H model then would be used in  the design process. The simulation results would be used for comparison to determine the noise  attenuation achieved by the silencer so the sound pressure level from simulation versus the actual  sound pressure level would not be relevant for comparison purposes.    

20   

4 DesignoftheSilencer
  The design should consider eight aspects: space limitation, weight, exposure to people, need for  cleaning, exposure to weather, contamination, gas temperature, flow velocity, and for intense cases  linearity of response, and acoustic fatigue.     The three main design criteria chosen were: noise performance, cost, and minimize back pressure. The  main objective was to attenuate noise to a sound pressure level that would not cause pain and hearing  loss to the occupants of the building and community.     Cost is always a constraint in engineering design and in order to keep the cost down, the design should  be simple. Any electromechanical devices such as a pump or actuators would be ruled out. The materials  used to fabricate the silencer should be commonly available.    The compressed air storage tank was designed to contain gas at a specified pressure level that would  allow the flow to become supersonic in the divergent section of the expansion nozzle and test section.  The ratio of the pressure inside the storage tank, Po, over the pressure downstream of the wind tunnel  exit, referred to as back pressure, Pb, is used to determine the location of the normal shock wave inside  the wind tunnel. The pressure in the storage tank is fixed, thus if the back pressure increases  significantly, the location of the weak normal shock wave in the diffuser shifts upstream into the test  section. When the value of back pressure approaches to the pressure level of the reservoir, the flow in  the entire wind tunnel will be subsonic. Increase in back pressure due to the silencer geometry should  be kept to a minimum to prevent the shock wave from moving upstream.          The noise reduction mechanisms from journal papers and benchmark were considered in all possible  design. The design configuration of the silencer was divided into three categories: the main type of  mechanism (active or passive), secondary passive mechanism, and the flow path of the duct. Three  possible configurations were randomly created based on the three categories and summarized in Table  1 and shown in Figure 19, 20, and 21 respectively.        21

Figure 21: Design 3 layout. 

 

The three chosen design configurations were then evaluated against the three criterions identified: Cost,  back pressure, and noise performance. The evaluation of the design configurations along with the  chosen design is shown in Table 2.     Criteria  Cost (40%)  Pressure Loss (40%)  Noise Performance (20%)  Total Score  Design  2  1  10  10  6.4

Table 2: Evaluation matrix of design configurations. 

In regards to cost, Design 3 would be the lowest in both material and labour cost due to its simplicity,  thus given a rating of 10. On the other end of the spectrum, design 2 would cost the most due to the  number of components required. The axial pump for increasing pressure and the sound shield are  expensive items. The reflective muffler is a labour intensive fabrication due to the placement of baffles  so the huge expense would yield a rating of 1. Design 1 would cost substantially more than design 3 due  to the tangential jet. The injection ports would likely take some time to fabricate and the pump would  add to the total cost.  The cost of Design 1 was estimated to be around the median of Design 2 and 3  and was given a rating of 4.     Design 1 would have the greatest back pressure in the tunnel because of the ushaped bend generating  recirculation. As a result, it was rated with a low score. The increased back pressure from the reflective  silencer and sshaped bend in Design 2 would be compensated with the axial pump, hence the design  was given a score of 10. Design 3 would have low to moderate back pressure from the increased friction  of the perforated liner. The back pressure magnitude should be comparable to Design 2 so it was given a  rating of 9.     

23   

Based on the noise attenuation mechanisms in each design and the level of noise attenuation achieved  for each mechanism from journal papers, Design 3 was given the lowest score for noise performance.  Design 2 had the greatest potential for noise attenuation due to the sshaped bend and the reflective  silencer. The noise due to the axial pump and possible noise from vibration would be contained in the  sound shield. The noise should be attenuated to an acceptable level as the air is exhausted out. It was  rated the maximum score. For design 1, noise attenuation would be achieved via the tangential jet, tabs  at the outlet, and from the corner bend due to sound reflection. The noise performance would be  between Design 1 and 3, and therefore was given a score of 5.    Based on the evaluation from the design matrix, Design 3 was rated the highest with a score of 7.8.  Consequently, further efforts were focused on Design 3 to refine the design by specifying the  dimensions and type of perforated liner.     

4.1 SilencerConfiguration
The silencer configuration selected was a straight path with acoustic chambers on all four surfaces of the  duct similar to Figure 22. Each chamber would have a perforated liner facing the flow and with the  possibility of sound absorbing material added into the chamber. The perforated liner separating the  chamber and the main flow in the duct serves two purposes. The holes act as a mechanism to  attenuated noise. The perforated liner also protects the porous material, if applied, from the flow of gas.  Without any screen or protection, the sound absorbing material would deteriorate due to the high  speed flow which would require adding more sound absorbing material each time before operating the  wind tunnel. If a rigid screen is not present, the flow entering the silencer could compact the absorbing  material due to its porosity and fibrous nature and create a large turbulent region from the sudden  expansion of the tunnel. As a result, it would generate another source of noise.

4.1.1 PerforatedLinerholediameterandopeningarea Four perforate liner with different hole diameter and opening area were selected initially as those were  commonly used and could be purchased in retail. The hole diameter and opening percentage are  summarized in Table 3.   Pattern  1  2  3  4    Hole Diameter  0.1875"  0.3125"  0.5"  0.75"  Opening percentage  33%  47%  48%  51% 

Table 3: Perforated patterns studied. 

The four patterns were modelled and simulated with the same physical dimensions and same boundary  conditions. Changes to the Fluent default settings that were used throughout the entire study are  summarized in Table A18 of Appendix A. Based on the results, the area weighted average APL at the  outlet face decreased as the hole diameter decreased as seen in Figure 23. The results are found in  Table A3 of Appendix A. Naturally, the maximum APL would be the variable of interest but the meshing  algorithm in Ansys created smaller mesh size for the patterns with smaller hole diameter. As seen from  the mesh sensitivity analysis, a smaller mesh size would yield a higher maximum APL so a clear  conclusion could not be drawn based on the maximum APL of all four patterns. The outlet was chosen as  the location of comparison because the mesh size would be similar for all four pattern mesh model. The  flow has gone past the acoustic treatment so the level of sound power should be comparable for all four  patterns.

Since the perforated liners also has different open area percentage, further simulations were performed  with hole opening percentage of 10%, 30%, and 50% for hole diameters of 0.3125" and 0.5" and 10%,  20%, and 40% opening percentage for 0.1875" hole diameter. Again, the areaweighted average APL at  the outlet was chosen as the basis of comparison over the maximum APL for the same reasons  explained previously. The general trend based on the results as presented in Figure 24 shows the area weighted average APL at the outlet decreases with greater hole opening percentage. Results for the  other variables are found in Table A4, Table A5, and Table A6 of Appendix A.  It was evident hole  diameter is a greater contributor than hole opening percentage in regards to noise attenuation.

The results were consistent with the findings of Tam and Ju where they found the acoustic impedance to  increase when the opening was divided into multiple smaller openings (30). The hole pattern layout was  also studied between aligned and staggered pattern as shown in Figure 25. The study focused only on  hole diameter of 0.1875" since it provided the greatest noise attenuation. The hole spacing dimension is  listed in Table 4.

The results were taken at a plane 0.75" offset inside the outlet plane defined as planeA to avoid effects  of boundary condition. Areaweighted average APL was used as the basis of comparison over maximum  APL because the greater open area percentage required finer mesh size. As a result, the higher open  area percentage would have a greater maximum APL as seen in Figure 26.

  The areaweighted average APL for 0.1875" hole diameter at planeA is presented in Figure 27. The  numerical results at the outlet and planeA for both aligned and staggered pattern are found in Table A 7 to Table A10 of Appendix A as well as the maximum APL in Table A11. From the results, it was  evident the staggered hole pattern yield a similar or lower APL depending on the hole opening  percentage. As seen in Figure 27, the APL reduced between 34 dB when the hole opening percentage  increased from 10% to 50%. The final design would incorporate a staggered 50% area open percentage  perforated liner since both Figure 26 and 27 revealed the staggered pattern has better acoustic  performance.

  4.1.2 PorousMaterial Porous material transforms sound energy from mid to high frequencies into heat. Ideally, the silencer  should have an absorption coefficient as close to unity across the whole frequency range so that it  would attenuate the maximum sound pressure per unit length of the silencer possible. This low end  frequency shortfall could be improved by increasing the thickness of the absorber or adding a  perforated liner over the porous absorber. The perforated liner serves two functions; it acts as a  Helmholtz resonator which could improve the absorption coefficient in the low frequency band and it  acts as a protection for the porous absorber so that it does not deteriorate quickly due to the high speed  flow in the tunnel. For a porous absorber of one or multiple layers with a perforated liner, the  impedance at normal incidence can be calculated using the following transfer matrix (1).      (4.1) 

  Delany and Bazley has created an empirical model to predict the absorption of porous material. It is  used to determine the characteristic impedance of the porous material based on the flow resistivity, ,  of the material.

Figure 28: Absorption coefficient comparison of various flow resistivity. 

 

Based on Figure 28, porous absorber with lower flow resistivity has a higher absorption coefficient for  the low end frequency whereas absorber with higher flow resistivity would perform better at the high 

30   

end frequency. Since human hearing is more susceptible to low and mid frequency noise than high  frequency, the lower flow resistivity sound absorbent material was chosen.        However, it was unknown how much of the sound energy dissipated was due to the function of the  viscous friction from the acoustic liner and whether the porous material would provide any performance  in noise attenuation for the case of high speed flow. From Meyer et al., they observed the attenuation  decreased and the maximum attenuation shifted towards higher frequencies for a Helmholtz resonator  with Rockwool backing as the flow velocity increased in a series of experiments (31). This could be  compared by running a simulation between a silencer with porous material in the chamber and one with  just air.    Glass wool was randomly chosen as the fibrous material placed in the chamber since it was a material  commonly used for acoustic applications. For modelling randomlyoriented fibre in Fluent, experimental  data of various materials from Jackson and James (32) was used to determine the proper inputs. The  dimensionless permeability of glass wool with a volume fraction of 10% along with the fibre diameter  used in the experiment was taken from the published table to calculate the viscous resistance  coefficient. The equation given by Fluent user's guide is (33)      (4.10) 

The study was performed in conjunction with the chamber height study in the next section.    4.1.3 ChamberHeight Since the calculation in previous section was suited for still air situations, several simulations were  performed to determine the effects of flow on the height of the chamber.     Five chamber heights were tested ranging from one to five inches in one inch increments and filled with  glass wool. The results are shown in Table A12 of Appendix A. Three chamber heights of one, three, and  five inches were simulated without glass wool with the results shown in Table A13 of Appendix A. The  perforate sheet modelled was pattern 1 with a chamber length of 22.5 inches. The relation between  chamber height and maximum APL of the entire wind tunnel is shown in Figure 29.

Figure 29: Maximum acoustic power level vs. chamber height. 

Based on the trend seen from the simulations, it was seen the exit Mach number of the wind tunnel  decreased as the dimension of the chamber increased in height.     In continuation of the previous section, the areaweighted average APL at the outlet revealed the  chamber without glass wool was lower than with glass wool. However the maximum APL measured was  the opposite as the maximum APL was lower for the chamber filled with glass wool. The trend also  showed the maximum APL decreased as the height of the chamber increased. From the APL contour plot  of the wind tunnel with the silencer height of 3" and 5" with glass wool as seen in Figure A9 to Figure A 12 of Appendix A, and without glass wool as seen in Figure A13 to Figure A16 of Appendix A, it was  clear that for the case without glass wool, the maximum APL was located inside the holes of the  perforated liner. It was also the source of maximum APL of the entire wind tunnel. The final design  would have a height of 5 inches and filled with glass wool.   4.1.4 NumberofChambers The length of the chamber is usually decided to tune out distinct tones and the chamber length should  be 1/8th the wavelength of the corresponding frequency of the tone. This however, would only be  practical for the low end frequency due to longer wavelengths. In dealing with supersonic flow, the  sound pressure level is fairly constant across the whole hearing frequency range. There is no specific  frequency to be tuned so the chamber length can be arbitrary. The benefit of dividing the silencer into  multiple chambers is to ensure sound does not travel inside the chamber from one end to the other. The  number of chambers included with the silencer design was investigated. A silencer of length 60" was  32   

studied with 3 configurations: 230" chamber, 320" chamber, and 610" chambers. The areaweighted  average Mach number APL at the outlet surface and maximum APL of the entire wind tunnel was  compared among the 3 configurations which is found in Table A14 and Table A15 of Appendix A. The  APL contour plot of the various configurations is seen in Figure A17 to Figure A22 of Appendix A. Based  on the results, the areaweighted average of absolute pressure and Mach number were similar at the  outlet for all three configurations. The 320" chamber had the lowest areaweighted average APL of all  but when compared to the maximum APL of the entire wind tunnel, the 610" chamber configuration  was slightly lower as seen in Table A15. However the 320" chamber was still the chosen configuration  of design because the maximum APL at the silencer region and the areaweighted average at the outlet  was the lowest of all. It would also save material cost in comparison to the 610" chambers.   4.1.5 Lengthofsilencer In theory, the longer the silencer, the more noise would be attenuated. However, there was a limit to  how long the silencer could be due to the size restriction of the room in which the wind tunnel is  located. The length of the silencer also had a trade off in increase of back pressure as the surface friction  of the silencer was much greater than the rest of the duct due to the presence of the holes. A series of  simulation was performed to study the average sound power on the outlet surface in relation to the  length of the silencer. Silencer lengths of 20, 30, 40, 60, and 100 inches were simulated. The perforated  sheet used was pattern 4. This particular pattern was chosen due to the fewer amount of nodes  required for the model. The results are presented in Table A16 of Appendix A.      From the results, it was evident that the areaweighted average APL and maximum APL did not decrease  linearly with increasing silencer length. 60 inches would be the ideal length of the silencer as the trend  of the acoustic power approached to an asymptote for lengths greater than 60 inches as seen in Figure  30. This phenomenon occurred because the increased number of holes also increased the number of  noise generating sources.

The study was tested against pattern 1, as this pattern provided the greatest attenuation, to determine  if it would yield similar results. Three silencer lengths of 22.5, 40, and 60 inches were tested with results  presented in Table A17 of Appendix A. The trend showed increasing noise attenuation with increase in  length of the silencer as seen in Figure 31, while the Mach number decreased and back pressure  increased. However, the odd data point was the absolute pressure at length of 60" having a lower  pressure than that of 40" length.

However when the maximum APL of all three lengths of pattern 1 was compared, the 40" length yield  the lowest level. This was probably because the 60" case required a slightly finer mesh than the other  cases which might had resulted with greater the maximum APL. The selected length for the silencer was  60".    4.1.6 PreliminaryConfiguration   The summary of the chosen silencer configuration is presented in Table 5.

4.2 SimulationofWindTunnelwithoutAcousticTreatment
For comparison purposes, the existing wind tunnel was simulated to determine the maximum APL and  SPL at the outlet.   4.2.1 InitialBaselineSimulation The noise source generated inside the wind tunnel was identified to be in the expansion nozzle and  along the walls as seen in Figure A1. The maximum APL of the baseline wind tunnel was 141 dB. From  Figure A2, the baseline tunnel did not exhibit a shockwave in the diffuser section as the flow remained  supersonic leaving the outlet. Three sound recorders were placed at different locations downstream of  the tunnel exit. The first recorder was placed in the centre at the outlet, the second was placed at the  corner of the diffuser at the outlet, and the third at the centreline, 30 cm away from the outlet. The  sound pressure level plot of each recorder could be found in Figure A3 to Figure A5. The calculated  overall sound pressure level by Fluent for recorders 1 to 3 were 150.88 dB, 143.85 dB, and 120.39 dB  respectively.    Human hearing is limited to a specific range, as defined by the region inside of the red boundary in  Figure 32.  

35   

  
Figure 32: Range of human hearing (34) 

 

Aweighting measurement scheme is normally used for sound pressure level measurements to reflect  the human hearing range and this correction could be distinguished when the unit of measurement is  displayed as dB(A). The Aweight sound pressure level plot for the three recorders is shown in Figure A6  to Figure A8.    A normal shock wave was expected in the diffuser of the existing tunnel, thus modification to the wind  tunnel was required.     4.2.2 RevisedBaselineSimulation A normal shockwave was missing in the diffuser in the simulation without acoustic treatment. As a  result, the noise output and sound pressure level at the outlet of the wind tunnel was underestimated.    The root of the problem could be explained with gas dynamics analysis. The schematic of a supersonic  wind tunnel is shown in Figure 33.   

36   

Normal   shock 

Figure 33: Pressure layout of wind tunnel. 

 

  From one dimensional gas dynamics analysis and assuming a calorically perfect gas, using ratios from  normal shock table of a test section of Mach 2.0, the downstream Mach number on the right hand side  of the normal shock in the diffuser would be 0.5774. The throat area ratio of the diffuser to the  expansion nozzle could be approximated using the ratio (3) in equation 4.10. 
, ,



, ,

  

(4.10) 

The height of the throat in the nozzle is 3.937 inches and the stagnation pressure ratio for Mach 2.0 is  1.3872. Therefore, the theoretical minimum diffuser throat height is 5.461 inches. However, the  designed diffuser height is 5.954 inches. One of the reasons for a larger diffuser throat height is to avoid  choking during the start up of the wind tunnel, so that the mass flow can flow past the diffuser. On the  other hand, a larger diffuser throat area will not be able to decrease as much velocity than a smaller  diffuser throat area.    The pressure ratio across the wind tunnel could be calculated with the following pressure ratios: 
, ,

  

(4.11) 

The values of the ratios were taken from isentropic properties and normal shock tables for M 2.0 where:  7.824, 1 , 4.5 1 , 1.256
,

,



1 

With the assumption of isentropic flow and a weak normal shock located in the diffuser, the theoretical  pressure ratio Po/Pb to run the tunnel was calculated to be 1.384. However, assuming atmospheric  pressure for the back pressure, the CFD result showed there was a normal shock at the test section  rather than in the diffuser. The one dimensional analysis assumed the flow velocity would be  approximately zero at the exit of the diffuser which is not the case physically. For the simulation of the  wind tunnel starting at the convergent divergent nozzle, the inlet total gauge pressure of 325,000 Pa  would yield an areaweighted average of Mach 1.04 at the outlet and it was evident the flow was  37   

decreasing to Mach 1.0 in the diffuser section as shown in Figure C1. Based on the areaweighted  average gauge pressure of 32033.61 Pa at the outlet surface, the ideal pressure ratio of the wind tunnel  would be approximately 3.20.     Instead of spending time, due to the mesh size involved, on trial and error to determine the total  reservoir pressure that would compensate for the pressure loss from the mixing chamber, the ratio  Po/Pb = 7.824 was used for all the simulations. As a result, this was also one of the reasons why the exit  flow was supersonic.   Several methods could be applied to decrease the exit flow velocity. The area velocity ratio (3), equation  4.12,   1     (4.12) 

shows that in order to decrease the velocity of a supersonic flow, the area would have to decrease as  well. Another solution to decrease the velocity of the flow leaving the diffuser would be to extend the  length of the diffuser.     The areaweighted average inlet total pressure at the convergent nozzle was 745095.4 Pa, which would  equate to an overall pressure ratio of 3.87. Based on the ideal pressure ratio of 3.2, the absolute outlet  pressure should then be 232842.3 Pa, a difference of 40,354 Pa. The total pressure drop across the  mixing chamber was 46670 Pa so the ideal pressure ratio from the mixing chamber inlet to the wind  tunnel outlet was 3.40.      The head loss due to friction from the tunnel wall and turbulence would dissipate the fluid energy.  Based on the outlet conditions, the calculated length that would generate a pressure increase was  approximately 1.54 m or 60 inches.  The calculation for the necessary pressure increase is found in  Appendix B.     The diffuser extension was added to the baseline wind tunnel model and simulated again. As shown in  Figure C2 and Figure C3, a normal shock wave could be seen in the diffuser in the Mach number and  pressure contour plot of steady state simulation with the extension. The acoustic power level plot was  presented in Figure C4 and a strong source of noise generation was located downstream of the normal  38   

shock as seen in Figure C5, which did not exist previously. This noise source was the result of the  presence of turbulence along the walls as seen in the turbulent kinetic energy plot in Figure C6 and  Figure C7. The areaweighted average Mach number and absolute pressure at the outlet was 1.02 and  217788.59 Pa respectively.     Four noise recorders were placed inside the diffuser at the centreline of the flow, where sound pressure  level was the greatest, and each spaced 20 inches apart. The first recorder was placed at the location  where the outlet would have been without the diffuser extension. Recorders 2, 3, and 4 were be placed  downstream of recorder 1, with recorder 4 located at the outlet.     The Aweighted sound pressure level for all four recorders is shown in Figure C8 to Figure C11 of  Appendix C. Recorder 1 was likely located upstream of the shock wave as the sound pressure level was  the lowest of all four. The sound pressure level of recorders 2 to 4 increased along the diffuser towards  the outlet. For receiver 4, the peak sound pressure level was between 161162 dB(A) for the 500 and  1000Hz octave band. The overall sound pressure level calculated by Fluent for the recorders 1 to 4 was  175.6202, 186.6273, 189.8786, and 190.2349 dB respectively.    

4.3 SimulationofDesign
A half symmetric mesh of the wind tunnel, mixing chamber, and silencer was generated using the  maximum and minimum mesh size deemed appropriate from the mesh sensitivity analysis. The mesh  included 4,997,531 nodes. The operation of the wind tunnel was first simulated in steady state using the  realizable kepsilon model and applying same boundary conditions and discretization scheme  throughout the whole report. The simulation was repeated in transient state. DES with realizable k epsilon and FW&H acoustic model was used, same as what was used in the validation case. 50,000 time  steps were simulated with a time step size of 0.00001 seconds. The computation was conducted on the  Orca cluster of Sharcnet which uses AMD Opteron 6174 processor running on CentOS 5.x operating  system.      

4.4 SimulationResults
4.4.1 SteadyStateResults The APL contour plot of the wind tunnel with silencer is shown in Figure D3 of Appendix D. The 60"  silencer had a maximum APL of 161.0928 dB. Figure D3 shows the main sources of noise originate at  39   

the convergent divergent nozzle and downstream of the shock wave where turbulence along the  diffuser wall begin to develop.     Data was recorded at two planes, one at the outlet and another at 3.69 m downstream from the throat  of the nozzle as shown in Figure 34, and identified as Plane B.

Table 6: Areaweighted average results from preliminary design. 

The maximum APL of the entire wind tunnel was 161.09 dB, in the silencer region, the maximum APL  was 133.73 dB, and at the outlet, the maximum APL was 114.99 dB. In comparison, the maximum APL of  the entire wind tunnel and at the outlet without the silencer was 140.07 dB and 124.95 dB respectively.       The silencer generated a strong normal shock wave inside the tunnel in the diffuser region. From Error!  Reference source not found., the turbulence generated downstream of the shockwave was another  noise source that reached up to 153 dB of acoustic power level.  

40   

  As seen in Table 6, there was a 16,991 Pa difference in pressure at the outlet as a result of the silencer  addition. From the Mach number contour plot in Figure D1 of Appendix D, the Mach number in the test  section was 1.95, close to the design Mach number of 2.0. An area of concern would be the size of the  supersonic region has decreased as the normal shock wave shifted upstream into the test section. The  contour plot results for the final design, Figure D1 to D3 in Appendix D, could be compared with the  baseline tunnel without acoustic treatment, Figure C2 to Figure C4 of Appendix C. This meant the  silencer has created a significant amount of back pressure.  From the length study of 60 inch silencer,  the Mach number contour plot in Figure A24 and pressure contour plot in Figure A25 of Appendix A  showed the shock wave was further downstream in the diffuser section without the mixing chamber in  the model. This had brought out a concern with the geometric model of the mixing chamber created for  the simulation. Further investigation is required to identify the difference in the normal shock location.       4.4.2 TransientResults Five sound recorders were inserted in the simulation. Two were located inside the tunnel at 3.69 m from  the throat, one at the centreline and one at the corner. Another two were placed at the outlet 3.72 m  from the throat, one at the centreline and the other at the corner. The fifth was placed at the centreline,  0.3 m away from the outlet of the tunnel. The sound pressure level vs. frequency plots of the five  recorder s are shown in Figure D5 to Figure D9 of Appendix D. The overall sound pressure level  calculated by Fluent for recorders 1 to 5 were 170.595 dB, 160.0783 dB, 168.8203 dB, 141.9525 dB, and  125.7462 dB respectively. Overall sound pressure level is the sum of sound pressure level across a range  of frequencies.    The Aweighted sound pressure level measurements of the five receivers are shown in Figure D10   Figure D14 of Appendix D. The highest Aweighted sound pressure level would be at the 500 and 1000  Hz octave band with a peak of approximately 142.5 dB(A) for recorder 1 and 141 dB(A) for recorder 3. In  comparison to the sound output of wind tunnel without acoustic treatment, the overall sound pressure  level at the outlet saw a reduction of 21.4 dB.       The reduction sound pressure level at the outlet was due to the dissipation of the turbulent region along  the diffuser. The presence of the holes in the perforated liner prevented the development turbulent  boundary layer. From this finding, it would also be ideal to have the silencer located immediately  41   

downstream to the normal shock wave in the diffuser. Turbulent boundary layer would form  downstream next to the normal shock, thus the silencer would dissipate the turbulent kinetic energy  and eliminate a major noise source.         
 

42   

5 Conclusion
A straight silencer, made of staggered perforated plain steel liner forming the tunnel wall, and  surrounded by four chambers of 60 inch length and 5 inch height, was designed to attenuate noise  generated from the turbulent boundary layer upstream at the expansion nozzle and diffuser wall. Noise  energy is transformed into vortex energy due to the presence of circular holes increasing the friction in  the flow. Noise energy is also transformed to heat due to the sound absorbent material. The physical  dimension of the silencer was optimized individually based on comparison of APL data from a series of  steady state simulations.     Two CFD simulation of the wind tunnel with the silencer was conducted where the broadband noise  model was applied for the steady state simulation and the FW&H model was used for the transient  simulation. The results from the steady state broadband noise model showed the silencer reduced the  noise generated from the diffuser walls. At the outlet surface, the maximum APL for the wind tunnel  with and without acoustic treatment was 114.99 dB and 124.95 dB respectively.     The transient simulation using the FW&H method showed the highest Aweighted sound pressure level  was approximately 142.5 dB(A) located in the octave band of 500 and 1000 Hz. Sound measurement  recorders placed at the corner and the centre of the wind tunnel showed sound pressure level was  greatest at the centre. This meant most of the noise attenuation would occur near the solid boundary.     Compared to the result of the acoustic treatment, there was a reduction of 21.4 dB in overall sound  pressure level at the outlet centre. For a design with a single noise attenuation mechanism, it would be  considered as acceptable since the reduction was close to the upper range of theoretical noise  attenuation level of similar silencer design (35). Some proposed noise attenuation mechanisms found in  journal papers only resulted in single digit noise reduction in dB. The design also met the design criteria  in which cost was minimize due to the simple geometry of the silencer. The back pressure did not  increase significantly, thus the desired Mach number was achieved in the test section. However, further  investigation would be required to determine the location of the normal shock wave.          The sound pressure level measured from the wind tunnel with acoustic treatment exceeded the 120130  dB threshold of damage to hearing. The level of attenuation fell short of the design objective with 

43   

regards to noise. In order to attenuate sound to below 120 dB, additional sound reduction mechanisms  is required in the silencer design. The designers of the benchmark cases may have arrived to a similar  conclusion and thus, their noise control solution included multiple sound attenuation mechanisms.  Based on this finding, further work on the design is necessary for greater increase in sound attenuation  level. As a result, the cost of the silencer would increase from the additional hours of analysis and  increase in complexity of the design.       

44   

6 Recommendations
  1. Before on making the decision to fabricate the silencer, simulate the model with a finer mesh,  smaller time step size, and higher order discretization scheme if computing resource is available.  The computing resources were limited in this study and the acoustic result from CFD simulation  thus far was under predicted due to dissipation in the numerical scheme. A suitable CFD  package for internal noise transmission with a higher than 2nd order discretization scheme would  lead to a reduction in numerical error and would likely predict the actual sound pressure level.  This would provide a more accurate result on noise attenuation provided by the silencer.     2. Conduct experiments on various sound absorbent materials on the silencer when built. The  study of various sound absorbing materials was not conducted in the design process due to the  lack of input variables in Fluent for sound absorbent porous material. A trial would determine  the appropriate material for this particular application.      3. In order to reduce the sound pressure level below the threshold of hearing loss, additional  sound attenuation mechanism would have to be explored in combination with the existing  design. A continuation to this study would be recommended to explore the impact on additional  sound attenuation features added to the wind tunnel.
