Abstract
Gurd-wara

[gur-dwahr-uh] [Punjabi: noun, a Gurdwara is a place of worship for the Sikhs. Gurdwara literally means "Guru's Door" or "Doorway to the Guru's house".

Sikh

[si:k] [Punjabi: fttW ]
noun, a title and name given to an adherent of Sikhism. The term has its origins in Sanskrit "disciple", "learner" or "instruction".

Very little has been contributed to the research of Sikh Architecture. Any research that does

exist offers little understanding and analysis of Gurdwaras in the Diaspora. This thesis explores the
design possibilities of a contemporary Gurdwara in a Canadian context.

Part of living in a multi-cultural society is the synthesis of cultures, identity and values that come with each group. Little has been discussed or researched on the architecture that has been transplanted by the Diaspora from their homelands. Many of these religious institutions are erected in rural and urban centres. Part of this transplanted architectural movement is from the Sikh Community. The first Sikh settlers arrived in British Columbia, Canada in the 1890's. Over time this small community of Sikhs
would build a temple that would become the first of many erected temples. This emerging architectural

style would be a distinctive fusion of Sikh and Canadian architecture. This notion of blending of Sikhi
and Canadiana would come through the symbolic gestures on the exterior facade detailing and usage of interior space within the worship place.

Today, in Canada there are upwards to one hundred Sikh Temples, known as a "Gurudwara".
Very little has been contributed to the research and academia on Sikh Architecture. The research that does exist offers little understanding and analysis of Gurudwaras in the Diaspora. This paper explores

the state of design and history of the Gurdwara(s) in a Canadian context. Some of the key difficulties in understanding the Sikh Diaspora architecture are: What constitutes a religious place of worship? How does a Sikh Gurdwara manifest in a contemporary Diaspora form? What is the architectural definition of
a Gurdwara as it pertains to semiotics? Caught between a struggle with their new homeland - Canada - and their native soil of the Province of Punjab, Sikhs search to find a Canadian Diaspora identity. This disengagement can be

CHAPTER ONE THE PUNJAB
Introduction

Historical Sikh Canadian Facts Physical Map of Punjab
Map of Punjab (1500)

This chapter gives a brief introduction to the complex history of the Sikhs and the Punjab region. Why and what is it to be Sikh and Punjabi is a key aspect of Sikh struggles in their own province and its

continuation through their migrations into other countries. Before understanding Sikh architecture, it is

focus on contemporary Sikh Worship place.

The Punjab
Appendix D the Ten Gurus

Modern day Punjab is vastly different from the one Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims prior to Appendix E Plan of the Golden Temple and Surrounding Areas independence in 1947. The previous borders of the region, referred to as Punjab, once incorporated East Pakistan and North-West India. Punjab is now one of the provinces of Northern India. The word Punjab means the land of the five rivers: the Sutlej, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum. The history of this region dates to the Harappan civilization (3000-1500 BC). During the Rig Vedic Aryan civilization (1500-1000 BC), the lands of modern day East Pakistan and West India were called Sapta

Sindhu, the land of the seven rivers. Poets and writers would romanticize about the flowing rivers and hills of ancient Punjab, an indication of the significance of these waterways in the culture. The region
was part of the Indian subcontinent where the classical melodious hymns of the Samaveda were sung (Arshi, 1986, p. 1). It was here that Rishi Valmik composed his celebrated work, the Ramayana. The love for the Punjab has deeper connotation to those who left this region. This region was sought after by many rulers and empires owing to its geographical location on important trade routes, fertile cropland,
ample water and transportation.

Punjab's location has had tremendous impact on its history. Its capital Lahore, was once a central trade city for Europe, China, Russia, Middle East and Southern India. Through the ages, invasions and feudal clashes have disrupted the landscape. With each passing empire or ruler, the border of the province were altered which affected the cultural ethos and psyche of its people. It was in this
contested region that Sikhism evolved during the rule of the Mughal Empire early in the 1500s. The first

Sikh Guru, Nanak Dev Ji had a revelation of One Ultimate Reality and One Creator, that pervaded all existence. "It was an alternative to the fatalism generated by the bigotry and superstitions prevalent in

the 15th century India (Mitra, 2004, p.5)". Sikhism would flourish after Guru Nanak Dev Ji, with nine
successors, from 1504 to 1708. Sikhs throughout the ages would fight to protect their honor against

ruling dictators of Punjab. This continued through a number of Anglo-Sikh Wars against the British Empire, in the early 1800's under the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The Sikh sovereignty survived up

CHAPTER TWO THE SIKH DIASPORA
Introduction
Canada is well known for its diversity and culture. It is home to multitudes of different faiths and cultures from around the globe. This chapter looks at Sikh migration to Canada and the issues of
modernity and the particular problems of the Sikh community as it merges into Canadian Society.

until 1849 when the Sikh Kingdom became a part of the British Empire (Mitra, 2004). Throughout the
history of colonial invasions, the British had not fought an empire with such military intelligence and tactics. The British lost more soldiers invading Punjab than in conquering all of the Indian sub-continent.
For the Sikh military this became the most prominent aspect of the Anglo-Sikh relationship. Owing to

the gallant display of chivalry, Sikhs were recruited into British Indian Army. This flourishing relationship
lead to an increase in Sikh migration throughout the British Empire.

Sikh Migration to Canada

During the Colonial period, Sikhs migrated to Australia, New Zealand, Britain, America and

The increased migration in the 20th century has shaped the diverse cultural mosaic of Canada.
Each community has their desire to create their own sense of place, one that resembles their native land and reflects their culture. Increasingly, many individuals, couples and families leave their country of
birth to search for better opportunities. It is a vision or passion deep within that brings them to these new worlds. They begin to shape the new society they live in, not only from a cultural and diversity standpoint, but also by contributing to its labour force, politics and regional and federal policy development. "A popular research theme among many scholars has been the Diaspora; the fragment of

Canada. Sikhs aided in the development of infrastructure in building roadways and rail lines and in
military duty through postings and military deployment with the British. During the post-colonial period, Sikhs continued to migrate, travelling to East Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America. Today the Sikh Punjabi community numbers 26 million worldwide. Early Sikh settlers arrived in Canada in 1897 and in America in 1899. The settlers struggled to find an identity in their new homeland. In Canada, Sikhs are increasingly becoming an integral part of the complex mosaic that defines this nation. In the past thirty years, Sikhs fought both governments and corporations for basic and fundamental civil
rights. This struggle parallels the struggle for the identity of a Sikh architecture in the Canadian
Diaspora.

Within less than a century, 100 'Gurdwaras' or Sikh temples have been built throughout North
American. The Gurdwara houses the most sacred of Sikh Scriptures, the 'Guru Granth Sahib. This 1,430 page document contains more than 5,984 hymns. The holy book is worshipped as the timeless Guru.

Sikh temples also serve as important social spaces for weddings, family functions, and the offering of meals. In the Canada, the Gurdwara has become more than just a place of worship. It is providing
services for its local and regional communities.

The intent of this thesis is to create a contemporary place of worship for the Canadian Sikhs. The proposed design of a contemporary Gurdwara in the new homeland of the Diaspora will based on the struggles Sikh Canadian identity and reference to the scriptures of the Guru Granth Sahib. These

embody the principals and values in the function and design of a temple. The thesis also investigates the
history of the design and construction of Insia's Golden Temple. It reviews the Canadian architectural
development of Gurdwara construction from the early 1900s to 2000. This thesis aims to start a

discourse about the practice of Sikh faith, identity within the Canadian context and to develop the
boundaries of Sikh Gurdwara design.

group of South Asians. However, they differ in many ways.

In recent decades Canada's relaxed on immigration has seen an increase of migrations underdeveloped areas in Africa, South America and East Asia. This diversity has helped Canada which was virtually racially, culturally, and linguistically homogenous become increasingly heterogeneous (Basran, 2003).

known as Pind) and very few major cities. Traditionally land and farming knowledge and traditions are
passed down by one generation to the next. Villages are therefore very self-sustaining and minimally
engaged with urban life.

without having undergone the experience of industrialization"(Nayer, 2004). Taking the same context and applying it to the second wave of immigrants from 1960 to 1984, she writes, "like other immigrants

The idea of a worship centre was a later formation in the History of the Sikh Religion. The
original Sikh meeting place or place to congregate was called dharamsalas - where dharam would take place.

This chapter will relate that the evolution of Sikhism through the Gurus have helped with the functional,

indifferent to the suffering's of others is really spiritual, hence the Sikh emphasis on the selfless service to others. To be a Sikh today is to share the teaching of the Sikh Gurus, to attempt to be faithful to them
and put them into practice in the daily life.

The Early Gurdwara

In the early 15th century Sikhism emerged as a new faith. Sikhism would follow through an
evolutionary path to become a major religion. With the maturity of the new faith, Sikhism would see its
population increase and the philosophy of their Gurus spread throughout India and beyond. Eventually the need for a worship place for the growing number of disciples soon became apparent. This form of

temple would not evolve until the 5th Guru, Guru Arjan (3T3 ^drjrt Â£?), when the compilation of the
holy scriptures, the Guru Granth Sahib was finished. The first evidence of Sikh architecture came with
Guru Arjan. This thesis will reflect on the previous four Gurus achievements and establish key

components that would lead to an understanding of the functional environments and space in the
design of the Gurdwara.

Guru Nanak was born in the village of Talwandi on April 15,1469. It is 65 kilometers to the south

west of Lahore in present day Pakistan (now known as Nankana Sahib in commemoration of the founder of Sikhism). Brought up in a middle class Hindu family, his father Kalyan Das Mehta kept the revenue
accounts for a feudal Landlord, Rai Bular (Sambhi, 1989). Growing up, Nanak was never at peace with

wealth and the status of caste structure, at the time was deeply immersed with society. He longed to serve the people and to work for their spiritual and moral welfare (Sambhi, 1989). During his twenties
Nanak had powerful spiritual experiences, which lead him to leave his job as a store keeper and his

domestic responsibilities to travel for 20 years (Mann, 2001). His extensive travels led him to sources of
wisdom and knowledge. Nanak visited great places across Asia, such as Sri Lanka, Kabul, Tibet and Mecca. Efforts were for understanding Islamic and Hindu thought, the Koran and the Vedas for insights

into the principles and philosophic concepts that had for long been obscured by the extravagant claims

of both Hindu and Muslim bigots (Mitra, 2004). Nanak strived to overcome past injustices and
inequality of the current dominant religions.

idolatry and the whole case system as pernicious" (Mitra, 2004). One who followed the decree of Guru

On the banks of River Ravi in Punjab, Guru Nanak established a community known (post

independence) as Karatarpur. Kartarpur is located in present day Pakistan about two kilometers from the India-Pakistan border. It is not known if a religious structure had been constructed on this site. However, this is quite probable, as Guru Nanak's teachings were the basis of the function of a worship centre. The concept and singing of hymns is present in a congregation. Perhaps the concept is being distilled of a central area or room which would be used to preach the word of the Guru Granth Sahib. This area would be for all, a room which would be for both men and women; those of other faiths, castes, classes and creeds - all shall sit as one and cite the

By the time of his death in September 1539, Guru Nanak Dev had established Kartarpur as the centre of Sikhism and had strengthened the new faith along with his followers. One of these followers

was Bhai Lehna, a worshipper of Durga (a Hindu deity), from the village of Khadur. Bhai Lehna listened to Guru Nanak's words and soon became a disciple. Devoted to his new faith and committed to Sikhi, Guru Nanak saw fit to give him the name of Angad, meaning "my limb" (Sambhi, 1989 p.4). Angad was
nominated as Guru Nanak's successor to carry on the divine undertaking which he had begun. In Guru Angad Dev Ji's era, Sanskrit was the religious language of the Hindus and the scriptures were written in Devanagri. "The seventeenth century traditions refer to the existence of a Pothi

and Sind area. Ultimately, his aim was to ensure the cohesiveness of the new religion as well as the
continuity of its practices and precepts (Mitra, 2004).

Further contribution sof Guru Amar Das came in social reforms relating to women. The practice
of 'Sati', the self-immolation of widows on their husbands' funeral pyres was forbidden under Guru Amar Das. The allowed widowers their choice to remarry or not and also stopped the public veiling of

women. This emancipation of women would further develop by appointing women as preachers. These
steps of equality of sexes became an integral part of design of a Sikh Temple.

Guru Angad Dev's compilation of the hymns of Guru Nanak was the stepping stone to the development of the holy text. This formally would be known as the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the holiest object in any Sikh
temple.

in a life of marriage. The customs and rituals of marriage necessitated the need for the sanctity of a
religious building.

Guru Ram Das is also credited in establishing the idea of a pilgrimage centre. This developed

the right bank of the Beas River based on the Kartarpur model and named it Govindal (Mann, 2001). The people of Govindal would see major developments in Sikh institutional structures. This period would see the introduction of festivals to enable distant congregations to come together and participate in the communal life in Govindal. These distant congregations were formalized into 22 branches called Manjis. In each Manji, Guru Amar Das appointed a local devout Sikh preacher who would conduct
sermons and daily prayers. By establishing the formation of an administrative system, Guru Amar Das

struggle for authority between the legal and the nominated leader ensued. Baba Mohan and Baba

Mohari, the two sons of Guru Amar Das, took control of their father's establishment as his legal heirs, while the nominated successor, Guru Amar Das, had to move to Ramadaspur (Mann, 2001).
Anticipating this issue, the search for another place than Govindal began. "Tradition has it that Guru Ram Das settled down at this place which gradually turned into a place of importance in the faith and

set the stages of establishing the future construction of religious buildings. This enabled the
development of Sikh architecture the Majha region, Jalandar Doab, Kangra Hills, and the Malwa region

was given various names Ramdaspur, Guru Ka Chak and Chak Guru Ramdas. Later this area would be

known as Amritsar (meaning pool of Nectar). Guru Ram Das discovered the town that became the location of the Golden Temple or Harimandir Sahib (Temple of God), the pinnacle of religious Sikh
architecture. P.S. Arshi writes:

CHAPTER FIVE HARMANDIR SAHIB
Introduction The Gurdwara is designed in the personification of the Sikh faith. Its functional space adheres to
the values and beliefs of daily Sikh practice. This chapter will look at the primary worship place of

As it appears from various historical writings based presumably on some

unspecified evidence, Guru Ram das erected a small Kachcha hut somewhere near the place where the Golden Temple is situated at present. Subsequently, a pre-existing small tank nearby was enlarged with ceremonial excavations so that the tank, thus excavatd, could serve as a sacred tank which was destined to be
famous later as the "pool of nectar" (Amritsar) to lend its name to that of the
place itself. (Arshi 1989, p.7)

chapter will review the various architectural, symbolic and artistic elements of the Harmandir Sahib, As a which clearly expresses the beauty that only can originate from Holy origins. Refer to Appendix E for Site

Guru Ram Das, encouraged people from all places to take residence in the new town. result Ramadaspur saw an increase in population and the devotees of Sikhism.

A market place was

established at the present site of Guru Bazar for a regular supply of essential commodities and exchange
of goods (Arshi, 1989).

Harmandir Sahib
Each day, this magnificent Sikh Shrine hosts over 50,000 people. It is a more powerful
statement knowing that each visitor without judgment of creed, race, caste or other faiths does not

leave its premise without being offered a meal. This gesture symbolizes the Sikh faith embedded within
the walls of Harmandir Sahib. The gold-plated shrine embodies the essence of the Holy Scriptures and

the path to righteousness. The Gurdwara is located in the holy city of Amritsar, Punjab. The Gurdwara was first conceived by Guru Ram Das and built later by the fifth Guru Arjan Dev. Guru Ram Das inaugurated the digging of the holy pool (pond). There are many legends as to why the location was

chosen by him. Many say it was a gift from the Mughal Emperor Akbar to Guru Amar Das's daughter,
Bib Bhani, Ram Das's wife. Another, story states that the "the land was received as a gift by Guru Amar das from Emperor Akbar as a token of thanks giving for his victory over Chittor Fort in Rajasthan" (Arshi, 1989). Some historians suggest that the land was presumably given to Ram Das when he had to leave
the town of the sons of Guru Amar Das. (Arshi, 1986).

There is one legend that speaks of the spiritual significance of the pond. "It is said that Guru Amar Das found at the banks of the pond a special herb he needed to cure an ailment of Guru Angad. There are many local traditions which speak of the medicinal properties of the water in the pool "(Shankar, 2004, p.8). The following passage from the Guru Granth Sahib helps to understand the pool's significance to
Sikh architecture:

The source of the tank's water is from the Ravi River, through canals known as

Hansali built in 1778. Prior to the construction of the canal system, the sacred pond's source of water

would be from the yearly monsoon rains. In 1783, the seasonal rain did not adequately fill the tank and almost dried up. It was then that Bhai Priam Dass and Bhai Santokh Singh solved the draught problem.
The Hansali were originally plain earth canals dug by the two Udasi saints, both from Amritsar (Arshi,

The conceptual idea behind the architecture of the Harmandir Sahib is that of spiritual enlightenment. The lotus is the symbol employed to express this inspiration (Shankar, 2004). The vernacular floral design is either painted or embossed in metal and precious stones and the inlay details are richly crafted by number of artisans from various faith groups. It was Maharaja Ranjit Singh who took up the work of illuminating the exterior with sheets of gold-plated metal. Ranjit Singh took an interest in the artistic elements of the Golden Temple.

There is literature referencing "that Maharaja Ranjit Singh was asked for the models from the then architects, and he selected one of the models submitted by the Ramgarhias who were well known in this branch of art at the time" (Arshi, 1986, p.90). Architectural historian, Pardeep Singh Arshi, concludes with a statement in his book Sikh Architecture, "the problem lies in the determination of whether the present structure follows its earlier model or in the latest construction, the temple building got an altogether new design and plan" {Arshi,

To summarize this section, the Harmandir Sahib is and always has been devoted to religious
functions. Other activities such as Langar, Hukamanams, Akal Bunga and other functions are held in

surrounding separate buildings within the ground of the temple. Traditional temples in India often take
their architecture, layout, functional spaces and form using the Harmandir Sahib as a model. Most

medium to large Gurudwaras were two-storeyed religious centres. The first floor would house the Guru
Granth Sahib and the second floor raised on pillars overlooked the ground floor. What is imperative to

note that there is nothing except for the main roof or clerestorey and/or a canopy above the Holy Book. The architecture is demonstrating the importance of the Guru Granth Sahib. The congregation sits around the outside of the Holy book and hymns are sung. There are doorways from all sides of the
building. This a distinctive characteristic of all Sikh Temple in India and Pakistan. Traditionally Sikh Architecture will always have domes. A traditional dome shape is in the form

of a lotus flower. The Guru Granth Sahib makes reference to the lotus flower in a number of passages in its text. The domes are wide and reach their maximum circumference less than half way up, hence

their characteristic shape (Dhanjal, 1994). The domes are fluted with a cylindrical form, as the flutes

reach the top there is an inverted lotus symbol.

Sometimes the tops of the domes have kalas, a

spherical form made from brass or gilded copper.

The entrance to the temple often has a prominent feature known as the Deorhi, the ornamental
gateway to the sanctuary. Large ornamental doors are sometime hung from a separate building or part
of the perimeter brick fenced walls.

The Harmandir Sahib is an outstanding architectural monument for the Sikhs. Historian and Author, P.S. Arshi, once wrote, "The Golden Temple is not merely a pilgrimage centre but a source of continuous spiritual and mystical inspiration for the hundreds of thousands of devotees who draw the
very essence of their life from its holy presence. (Arshi, 1986, p.l).

CHAPTER SIX EARLY DIASPORA GURDWARAS (1900 to 1950)
Introduction
There are over hundred Gurdwaras in North America. In the early 1900's, the first Gurdwaras were in

the British Columbia, Canada. In the United States, the Gurdwara movement began in Stockton,
California. This chapter highlights the early Gurdwara movement in Canada.

Early Diaspora Gurdwaras (1900 to 1950)

Captain Kesur Singh is one the first recorded Sikh soldiers who arrived in Canada in 1897. Standing proud and statuesque, draped in the green, red and gold symbolic of the British Empires Sikh Regiments. He was a soldier who has fought hard battles and travelled to far off place (see Figure 7.01). He and others were invited to attend Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in London. When returning from the Royal event their Hong Kong regiment travelled through Canada. Their journey back home led them to the British Columbia coast. They were deeply moved by the rich landscapes and climate there as it brought back memories and images of their homeland if the Province of Punjab. The word of this new found place soon travelled to villages back home, promising of opportunities of Canada and favorable
conditions. This gave birth to the beginnings of the first wave of Sikh Immigrants into Canada. Passage from the Guru Granth Sahib of a Sikh Traveller:

!

The traveller comes and goes along the highway.

Figure 6.01 - Captain Kesur Singh By 1903, there were approximately three hundred East Indians. The numbers increased from 1904 to 1907 as 5,185 immigrants arrived in Canada: 5158 were men, 15 women and 12 children (Nayar,

2004). According to James Chadney, author of The Sikhs of Vancouver, "the rather sudden influx of East Indian immigrants with the first for years, apparently was initiated by two major factors (Refer to

and the Khalsa Diwan Society were the main Sikh Canadian institutions engaged in guiding and
cultivating the Punjabi Community (Singh, 1994). By 1908, this group would build one of the primary
Gurdwaras in Vancouver.

During this early period of immigration, there were no regulated policies in effect. But

By 1907, the issues surrounding immigration policies and labour issue brought forth further

animosity towards the new comers. "In the disturbed labour situation of 1907, anti-oriental riots took
place in Vancouver when Chinese were used as strike breakers. Coupled with labour unrest and

mistrust of Asiatic labour because of their willingness to work for comparatively low wages, 'racial'
resentment soon arose and agitation started against the immigration of East Indians (Chadney, 1984, p.27)". It wasn't until 1908, that the Canadian government decided to erect a barrier against Asian immigration, partially in response to the 1907 anti-Asian riots in Vancouver against the Chinese,

Japanese and East Indians (Nayar, 2004). The Canadian government passed two orders in council, which were specifically designed to prohibit East Indian immigration to Canada by raising the head tax from
$25.00 to $200.00 and the other prohibited entry into Canada of people unless they came directly from
the country of their birth or citizenship by a continuous journey (Chadney, 1984). No other immigrant

groups were restricted entry to Canada without $200 dollars in their possession. Furthermore, they

could not arrive unless on a ship sailing directly from India to Canada with no other ports of call.
The early periods of Sikh immigration in Canada was historically marked by deep racial tensions. Quite often small communities of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs would informally gather to fight, poverty,

Walter W. Baer from the Canadian Courier wrote, "the temple cost nearly $10,000 and is a monument to religious zeal and faith of a people far from home, in a strange land which has not treated
them justly and among a people to whom they are united by but two bonds. The first of these is their attachment to the throne and empire of the British people who delivered India and the second is their

unconquerable conviction that 'God hath made of one flesh the nations of the earth'. It is the last rather
than the first which makes the Sikhs tolerant of the abuse and misrepresentation to which he has been

subjected by the people who send missionaries to show him the way to salvation" (www.sikh.org).
Many of the Sikh men of Vancouver worked in the lumber industry. Managers of two lumber companies provided the Sikhs with the necessary lumber for construction of the Vancouver Gurdwara. Lumber was given at cost to keep their Sikh workers from moving elsewhere (Singh, 1994, p. 41). This

was the first of many Gurdwaras that were constructed with cooperation between the lumber yards of
British Columbia and their Sikh employees.

The Vancouver Gurdwara met all the needs of a Sikh place of worship and as a community

centre.

Construction of the Gurdwara was far from the traditional forms of Sikh architecture, both in

the use of materials and construction procedures. However, the Gurdwara maintained a distinctiveness of Sikh identity. Unlike traditional Sikh buildings which are extremely detailed with precious stone

inlays, gilded gold lotus domes and marble facades, the Vancouver Gurdwara was decorated with simple geometrical forms, arches and patterns. The second floor colonnade had gestures of traditional forms,
with repetitive simply decorative column arches which stretched around the building. The main

of Abbotsford. The Gurdwara represents an astonishing dream of the Indo Canadian immigrants. Prior
its completion, the small Sikh community would congregate in a house in the community of Maple

The symbolic meaning of the Vancouver Gurdwara made a large impact for the small Sikh

community. The Gurdwara served the true sense of Sikh philosophy and code of conduct: allowing all

problems. The Khalsa Diwan Society would oversee construction of Gurdwaras in New Westminster,

This donation represented the connection between the Sikhs and the lumber industry of Abbotsford and
the trust of the Tretheway family as the largest employers of Sikhs.

Construction began with the leadership of Sunder Singh, who also represented the IndoCanadian community. Sunder Singh and another visionary supporter, Argin Singh, persuaded others to

Within the same year, the Khalsa Diawan Society erected a Gurdwara on Victoria Island.

The

emerging style of architecture would be similar to the Gurdwaras in mainland Vancouver. With the
exception that brick being was used on the exterior facades (see Figures 7.12 & 7.13). The rhythm or repeating style is consistent with a grand staircase leading to the second level sanctum of the building with the ground floor used for multipurpose functions. The building would be constructed using simple wood frame methods, with horizontal wooden drop sidings, and door and window moldings. Very little ornament was applied to the architecture. This is probably owing to the use of material and assimilating

to the local vernacular of the time.

Assimilation goes beyond the architecture to clothing. Men all dressed in three piece suit similar that of the locals. Again, there
is link with the lumber industry and the Sikhs. For the most part, Sikhs had established themselves as a community in British Columbia. The British Empire had

as a teenager in 1906 and first found work with the Canadian Pacific Railway. He soon gained experience in the lumber industry on the mainland of Vancouver, working at the Fernridge Lumber Company. Within three years, the mill had failed and its thirty-five employees including Mayo Singh,
purchased the mill and operated it as the Cheam Lumber Company. By 1917 the timber was exhausted, the group then bought the Marcum Lumber Company near New Westminster. When this venture came to its end, Mayo Singh found private reserves in the Esquaimalt and Nanaimor Railway Belt between Duncan and Lake Cowichan. Over time he would seek out and obtain timber rights to land along railway lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway on Vancouver Island. The new sawmill was known as the Mayo Mill

In 1935, the small community of Hillcrest about four miles from Duncan held their celebration of the opening of their worship centre. This all wood building was constructed in similar style to the Sikh temples but on a smaller scale. The Gurdwara's ground floor was used as the kitchen and communal service area.

The early Sikh Gurdwara movement in Canada was definitely a defining moment of the early Sikh settlers of British Columbia, Canada. The Gurdwara represented more than a religious institution but marked major early achievements of the new comers to Canada. It also solidified the beginning of
new movement in transplanted architecture from India.

During the same period, the American Sikh Movement was also developing in the early 1900's. Similar to the Khaslsa Diwan Society, the Sikhs from Stockton, California banded together to form the

Pacific Coast Khalsa Diwan Society. In 1915, the Sikh Community there erected the first Gurdwara with

the help of architect W.B. Thomas and contractor A.J. Phee. The community raised $3,400.00 to build

CHAPTER SEVEN THE SIKH GURDWARA MOVEMENT, 1960 to 2000
Introduction
With relaxed immigration policies, the second wave of immigration to Canada began in the

1960's and later in the early 1980's. This brought new Sikh immigrants to Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and
Atlantic Provinces. Early 1960's Gurdwara design, were very similar in nature but owing to economic

conditions and population. Sikhs congregations would gather in rented community centres and single family houses. It wasn't until the later part of this movement that a clear distinctive architecture
emerges in corresponded to Sikh population, wealth and the development of the Sikh community to
main stream Canada.

Sikh Gurdwara Movement

Today, there are approximately 100 Sikh temples in Canada. Most of these religious buildings were built from the 1960's to the present day. This chapter will explore only a few of the major religious centres in Canada that are significant to the understanding of Sikh architecture in Canada. We first examine the Paldi Gurdwara in Victoria, British Columbia.
With an increased population in the town original two storey temple did not serve the community needs. In 1960, the original Paldi Gurdwara was replaced with a larger building. The

construction and funds were donated by the Mayo Family. There are major key architectural and
community difference to the Gurdwara which is mandated by the regional needs of the community. Firstly, the population of the community is larger and therefore requires increased congregation space in the sanctum and in the Langar hall or room. Unlike the rest of Canada, Victoria and mainland Vancouver have second and third generations of Sikh Canadians. This introduced a number of social issues, such as language, the elderly, learning of Punjabi culture, education and the Sikh religion. These same issues did not arise elsewhere in Canada until the late 1980's and the 1990's. The newly constructed Paldi Gurdwara used traditional timber construction technique as the earlier British Columbia Gurdwara but with an increased level of decorative style. The wood framed

windows have triangular shaped transoms. This form repeats itself in a number of windows in the building but also with wooden guard rails. This repetitive architectural gesture is reflective of Indian
Buildings. For the first time, we see the Nishaan (Flag Pole) as a prominent architectural feature. The

Nishaan, on a separate pole rising from the ground, is higher than the Gurdwara represents the two
major notions. Firstly Sikh Canadians as

The Ontario Khalsa Darbar Society opens their doors to a temple in Mississauga in the 1970's. On the corner of Dixie and Derry Road, a single brick two storey house was been converted into a temple. Without the Nishaan (flag pole) erected on the front lawn of the property one would not know it was a place of worship. As with the Sikh settlers of British Columbia, the Sikhs of Ontario were small in number and with limited economic resources. The ground floor housed the worship area, while the basement was used as the Langar hall/communal kitchen. Figure 7.09 depicts an image of a typical house which would be likely used as temple. During the same time, the Sikh community of Oakville

would host Sunday sermons at various individual family homes. This continued until enough resources
were available for the community to move to local community centre halls. Like many Sikh communities in other provinces this was the way of establishing Gurdwaras within Canada.

By the late 80's the small community in the Peel region had grown rapidly. The Ontario Khalsa Darbar Society hired architect Haral Dhir to design their new Gurdwara. In 1989, the new temple opened their doors (see to Figure 7.10) and would be known the Dixie Gurdwara. The lower level of the complex housed a large kitchen for the growing population. The second level housed the main worship hall (see to Figure 7.12). Surrounding the main hall there are smaller rooms being used for smaller

everyday life in India. What's unique about the Dixie Gurdwara is the use of ornamental features its exterior facade treatment and the grounds. Here the use of traditional forms becomes part of the architecture. Lotus type forms are used above the windows and entrances. The central worship hall

Over the next decade the Dixie Gurdwara would have two major building extensions. The first

reflected the population growth of the community. The new expanded area included a twenty-four
hour communal kitchen and larger community related rooms. These rooms are important to

understand and reflect on their key integration of Sikh Canadian architecture. These spaces include a library for Sikh studies; various classrooms to conduct language teaching in both English and Punjabi; and rooms for music lessons. Other Gurdwara's in Canada followed this pattern of fulfilling the needs of the community. The Dixie Gurdwara's second building expansion resulted from a regional need to develop youth, adult and elderly fitness activities. Therefore, a portion of the building is dedicated to an indoor gymnasium (see to Figure 7.16 & 7.17) and the northern portion of the ground is used for an outdoor recreational field and basketball courts. Like other Canadian Gurdwaras, functional programs
other than that of religion are based on regional or community needs.

In the early 2000's, a new expression of Gurdwaras began to appear in Canada. The construction of these temples continued to incorporate spaces for community and regional needs. This addition to the new temples was the introduction of a refined vocabulary of Sikh architecture. Diverging away from Canadian influences, these temples would begin to demonstrate Indian vernacular architecture. This results in several factors. Now with more wealth and feeling more integrated into
Canadian society, the Sikh community can afford to build in their traditional forms as a way of

temples in Canada. The overall shape is symmetrical in plan and in elevation. Three sides of the

building are flanked with entrances into the temple, in accordance with the traditional form of the
Golden Temple. The forms, volume of spaces and architecture expressions are reflection of Sikh

architecture. The windows and entrances have similar arches as those of Sikh temples in India. Each
stepped roof line and volume of space is a reflection of the importance of function on the interior.

Continually, the lotus domes are exact replicas of those in India. Domes hover over the rooftops each
again defining the importance of the interior space in relation to their size (see to Figure 7.19). The

exterior building envelope is cladded with precast concrete. Each panel is elaborately detailed with
repetitive Sikh symbols and forms. The same details are seen throughout the building, such as the guard
rails, floors and walls (see to Figure 7.19).

Typical of many other Canadian Gurdwara the Kitchen / Langar hall is situated in the lower level

and prayer hall is located on the main level (the 80'x80' room fits more than 1000 people) (see Figure 7.20). There is however an additional features similar to that of Sikh Temples in India; it's the
introduction of a grand clear storey and a second level (see Figure 7.21 & 7.22). An upper level mezzanine walkway opens into the main prayer hall; above this level there are large windows, bringing

natural light into the worship space. Adjoining the walkway are rooms and a secondary worship hall used for religious family or community events. The additional rooms at this level are commonly used to

facilitate the needs of language lessons, teaching of hymns, and sleeping quarters.

CHAPTER 8 LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction This section is dedicated to literature on Sikh Architecture. Very little has been recorded or written about this segment of Indian Architecture. There are some articles and journals that touch upon the idea or development of Sikh Architecture in India but they do not explore its early origins. Furthermore study and research is needed on this topic. Furthermore, there has not been any

exploration or understanding of Sikh Architecture in Canada, nor have there been historical accounts of

building resembling to Gurdwaras in India. This poses the question, what will the next generations of
Gurdwara a reflection be of.

There are significant identifiers of Sikh architecture. One prime example of Sikh architecture is the sacred temple which is known as the Gurdwara. The architectural attributes of the Gurdwara separates its design from a Mosque and a Hindu temple. The Gurdwara's dome, arches, balconies, columns and
most of interior spaces are unique and specific to the identity of the Sikh religion. In the Greater Toronto Area, there are more than a dozen Gurdwaras supporting its growing Sikh Community. Sikhs arrived in North America as temporary residents in the early 1900's. They are now part of

the growing Canadian Diaspora from South East Asia. The Canadian Diaspora is caught between two
worlds, one of their origins and the other of their adopted nation. The struggle of identity can be correlated with Sikh religious institutions built in North America. Places of worship are in the form of

small industrial warehouses, individual personal homes, and newly erected "cookie cutter" Gurdwaras. The questions that arise are: what constitutes a religious place of worship, and more importantly, how does a Sikh Gurdwara manifest in a contemporary Diaspora form? The following literature review
attempts to demonstrate the Canadian Diaspora struggle to become citizens and in defining traditional

Sikh architecture in the context of 20th century. These two areas of study will then set the stage for the
creation of a new form of Sikh architectural identity within the Canadian Diaspora. In the most recent publication Sikhism and Sikh People by Religion Newswriters Association, its author(s) critically reflects on the North American Diaspora. The book details a number of different categories such as Human Rights, Sikh Arts and Culture and includes a chronology of the first Sikh

temples that appeared in North America. The authors develop their essays on both numerical and

factual evidence. The material explores early migration patterns of the three million Sikhs residing
59

mainly in three regions outside their homeland of South Asia. There are well over 700,000 Sikhs living in the United Kingdom, almost half a million each in the United States and Canada and a small proportion
in Singapore, Malaysia, Kenya and Australia (Sikh Network, 2002). Each location faced different ranging

CHAPTER 9 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS
Introduction
This section outlines the design hypothesis, by summarizing critical question on early Gurdwara of India, the Sikh Temple in Canada from 1900's to 1944's as the first Gurdwara movement and the

issues from marginality, identity within a country and establishing their citizenship. The report further
states that the laws within each country were repressive, regressive and discriminatory. Immigrants

from Asian origins could not become citizens; they could not own land, nor could they sponsor their family members (Sikh Network, 2002). Although Sikhs fought in both the First and Second World Wars
Research Hypothesis

and were free to move within the British Empire, countries like Canada and United States did not see fit to abide with the rulings of the British. Sikhism & Sikh People clearly illustrates the underlying issues of
Sikh Identity in the Diaspora.

The first wave of early Sikh settlers arrived in Vancouver, Canada in 1897 and in San Francisco, in

1899. 1906, Sikhs established their first Gurdwara in Stockton, California. This first Gurdwara is vastly unlike the historical Gurdwaras cited in Pardeep Singh Arshi book Sikh Architecture, indicating the

beginning of the Diaspora assimilation. Arshi develops the distinctiveness of the Gurdwara through
understanding Sikh architecture in the Punjab region between the periods of 1500 to 1800. He writes in particular about the holiest of Sikh Gurdwara, the Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar, Punjab. In the forward to Arshi's book, Kushwant Singh writes, "The piece de resistance of Sikh architecture is of course the

Golden Temple in Amritsar" (P.S. Arshi, 1986, p.l). For Sikhs collective body a physical space is defined
by their myriad of morals and common union. This basis is deeply rooted in the Sikh scriptures Guru

Granth Sahib which is housed as the central focus of the all the Gurdwara. Arshi doesn't write about the evolution of the Gurdwara but recites the development of the Sikh Gurdwara in the context of the society and culture in which it exists. Unlike S.S. Bhatia's journal An outline of Sikh Architecture, who
attempts to illustrate a clear style of architecture, "outlining the main elements, principles and objects

Gurdwara. Credit: Sikhpioneers.org

of building design with a view to conjuring up an overall picture of a style of architecture, which can be
doubtlessly called Sikh Architecture" (S.S.Bhatia, 1985 p.l).

These journals and books are important secondary sources of evidence on Sikh architecture of India and Pakistan. Both Arshi and Bhatia demonstrate the importance of identifying historical Sikh architecture in the context of history and location. However, Sikh and Sikhism is a critical take on the
discourse of the Diaspora of North America.

forms and yet be part of Canada. Sikhs have over 100 years of settlement in Canada. They, like other
immigrants of Canada are part of the growing history of Canada.

It is estimated that there will be one million Sikh in Canada. This number is outstanding for any Diaspora community. Less than one hundred year there is one hundred temples established in North America. This number will increase due to the population growth and community needs. With

dialogue between architects and communities the next generation of Canadian Gurdwara, through the use of material, eco technologies and contemporary design can be a reflection of our current era.

Figure 9.03 - Golden Temple. Credit: author.

This thesis has reviewed three major areas of Sikh architecture and design progression. Firstly,

taking a look at traditional style of Sikh architecture in the India, more specifically the Harmandir Sahib,
most commonly known as the Golden Temple (see Figure 9.01). Review the history of the culmination of this temple and its reflection to the philosophy and ideologies of Sikhism. Secondly, examining the

early Gurdwara in Canada from 1900's to 1940's. Taking a look at how early Sikh settlers erected a
temple that blends in the vernacular style of Canada, while maintaining hints of traditional Sikh

architectural style. This can be seen in the first temple built in 1908 by the Khalsa Diawan Society of
Vancouver (see Figure 9.02). Lastly, this paper explored the design and functional uses of Gurdwaras being designed from 1960's to 2000's. Take for example the La Salle Gurdwara in Montreal, Quebec. It

reflects modern day construction, and yet it clearly illustrated a non contemporary style. The design of
the building is based on temples from India.

What does the future hold for Sikh Canadian architectural design? Will designers and architects

of Canadian Gurdwara move towards a traditional design, such as the La Salle Gurdwara. Or keep creating box type warehouse temple with no articulated architectural style, such as the Dixie Gurdwara
and other temples built in North America.

It should be the mandate of Gurdwara associations and the Sikh community to work alongside

Canadian architects to arrive at an articulate and functional temple that upholds the values of traditional

Chapter 10 Design Summary
Introduction
This chapter is the proposed conclusion or design output of the research and study conducted in the previous chapters. Previous chapters brought forth a number of key identifiers that will result as the
bases of a contemporary Sikh place of worship.

Design Summary

The proposed Gurdwara design should reflect a number of crucial points. The design should
consider the historical context of Sikhs in Canada, such as their relationship with the lumber industry in

the early 1900's. The Indian Gurdwara's central focus has been on religious matters, where Canadian Gurdwaras have incorporated a community based approach to facilitate the needs of their congregations. This is partially based on regional needs and in addition to help Sikh community keep its
traditions, culture, and language and values. Furthermore, a contemporary design will use present day construction and green technologies. A design formulation or process must be one of integration of

computer applications, such as scripting methods to define architectural forms. In addition, with the
use of 3d printers and laser cutter to produce tangible outputs, modeling techniques become part of the

design research methodology to understand architectural forms and construction techniques.

Site Location
Site selection is an important part of the design a

contemporary Gurdwara. The selected location decided is the within the city limits of Toronto. The City of Toronto is a

metropolis centre in Canada. Many faiths, such as the Jews,

Muslim, Hindus and others have religious institutions. By selecting Toronto as the location for a Gurdwara is making a statement to the rest of Canada. Up to now there has only been two Gurdwara in Toronto which do not have the capacity to facilitate large congregations. Canadian Sikhs contribute to the
public service through local community outreach programs, all

levels of government and are part of daily life.

In this era it is important to understand issues of global warming and our environment.

Therefore, its vital to respond to LEED's code of conducts and mandates. The chosen location is near public transportations as in LEED guidelines. A subway station is minutes away from the site. The GO
Transit and TTC systems enables all GTA residents to access this location.

Every year, the larger Sikh Community of Southern Ontario conducts their annual parade from

the C.N.E. Grounds to Toronto City Hall. It is to celebrate Vaisakhi, which marks the beginning of a new
solar year and new harvest season (see Figure 10.01).

Research Methodology Studies
Part of this design research is to explore the form of the lotus dome. It is the one most defining architectural features of a Sikh temple. The Guru Granth Sahib makes reference of the lotus flower in
many of its passages. The relationship with the lotus dome defines the location of the Guru Granth
Sahib is located.

Exploring and manipulating this form can only come from scripting methods and CAD related computer programs. Rhino 3D was used to understand the form of a single petal of the lotus dome (see
Figures 10.07,10.08). To create the final lotus form for the Gurdwara, more than one type of

application must be used, such as Grasshopper and AutoCAD. The Grasshopper scripting program was used for manipulating the height and width of the lotus. Through the use of scale bars the height and width of the lotus can be quickly drawn within seconds, a process which would normally be tedious.

Final Output Design
Part of this design research is to explore the form of the lotus dome. The Guru Granth Sahib makes reference of the lotus flower in many of its passages. The lotus is exploited by increasing the

volume of the entire form to encompass the sanctum. The lotus dome is then enclosed in a glass cube
form. Presenting a unique dialogue of forms from the inside out and outside in. The glass cube houses the precious elements of the lotus. The lotus in turn contains the holy Sikh text. The lotus form is held by vertical timber structure - representing the relationship between early Sikh settlers. The Gurdwara is depressed to exemplify the importance of its content from other adjacent buildings. It allows for a

relationship with the large urban context, where both non-Sikh and Sikhs can engage with the building
at various personal levels. Due to climate conditions the building uses eco-technologies to help provide comfortable interior conditions. Exterior sun shading devices, double skin membrane and operable
windows allow various passive interior environmental controls. Exterior glass is fritted to help with sun exposure and glare.
