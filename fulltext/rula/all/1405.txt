ABSTRACT
THE IMPACTS OF CliMATE CHANGE ON THE AVAilABILITY OF GRANUlAR RESOURCES IN THE INUVlAlUIT SETTlEMENT REGION, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

Emily Borsy Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and 1\{lanagement Ryerson University, 2009

Physicat community infrastructure is vulnerable to changes in permafrost regimes resulting from· warming in Arctic environments. The vu.lnerabili.ty of community infrastructure is greatly exacerbated by factors related to the access.ibility of aggregates that are used to insulate built form from the active layer of the permafrost. The ability ofcommunities to address stresses brought about by melting permafrost is a function of access to aggregates, the ability to transport them, and competition for gravel between users. In the lnuvialuit Settlement Region readily accessible aggregate is in short supply, and concerns about resource allocation pre-date current prognoses about the impact of global warming, The prospect is that while demand for gravel will increase as permafrost is degraded, competition from new activities along with degradation of winter roads may further stress supplies. This research project examines the manner in which institutional arrangements, the geography of aggregate distribution, transportation, and competition from emerging new activities exacerbate vulnerabilities associated with permafrost melt in the lnuviatuit Settlement Region.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1-· Overview

The Arctic region is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe environmental changes on the planet (Hassol, 2004). There is evidence that the Arctic region has warmed at almost twice the global average rate of 0. 74°C over the past 100 years {Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007). Over the past fifty years, a change of 2 to 3"C has been observed over the Canadian Western Arctic (Zhang, et aL, 2000 in Furgal and Prowse, 2008, pg.

61). In the Mackenzie District specifically, between 1948 and 2005, there was a warming of 2oC
while the average increase for Canada over the same period was 1.2°C (Furgal and Prowse, 2008, pg.67). The impacts of warming air temperatures caused by climate change on permafrost, or frozen ground, are already being observed. Since the 1980s, the temperature at the top tayer of permafrost in the Arctic has increased by up to 3°C {IPCC, 2007). When the temperature of permafrost increases, settling of the ground occurs and the thickness of the active layer increases, creating significant vulnerabilities for community infrastructure (Hassot, 2004, pg. 88, IPCC, 2007, pg. 655). Frozen ground plays a role in supporting Arctic infrastructure. Current engineering designs for infrastructure construction are based upon the known properties of the frozen ground including thawing properties, and seasonal frost heave and settlement patterns (Andersland and ladanyi, 2004). Climate change will likely cause the properties of the permafrost to change, therefore altering engineering requirements for constructing infrastructure. The anticipated engineering response to the consequence of permafrost melt is to use more granular material as a base for buildings, roads, airstrips and utility lines in order to minimize thawing due to exposure of the ground to warmer temperatures. Other technologies

currently have much larger price tags to implem.e nt, and therefore are not usuaHy economicaU' viable for infrastructure in small communities (WoJfe, 1998, pg; 20}. The lnuvialuit Settlement :Region (iSR), in Canada's Western Arctic is one Arctic region that wiUexperiencethe impacts ofdimate change on infrastructure. Usability to prevent infrastructure failure depends on the availability ofgranu~ar resources. Gravel is found within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, however, it is unevenly dispersed throughout the r~gion making gravel difficult to access for some communities. Likewise, there are constraints to developing many of the sources....__they may be located in an ecologically significant area, seasonally inacce~sible, contain massi'.{e ground i~e, orbe of poorquaHty. ·Aside from constraints to access, a complex regulatory system within the region has made the management of granular resources unclear in the past and isonly,beginning to be simplified at present. In addition to historical issues facing granular resource acquisition and management, dim ate change may present more obstacles to abating infrastructure failure in the ISR communities. The available supply of granular resources coufd be Hmitedbythe decreasingJength ofthe ice and tundra road season while demand for gravel wiU increase due to elevated ,reqttirements for more granularresourtes to create thicker insulating layers between the permafrost and infrastructure.
< furth~rmore,

in the region, placing additional demands on already stressed resources.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.2- Purpose and Objectives The purpose of this paper is to identify the potential impact of dim ate change on the availability of aggregate resources in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. This is achieved through the investigation of the impacts of dim ate change on the supply of and demand for granular resources, as well as the managerial capacity of land owners within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. The overall objective is to obtain an understanding of the implications of a changing environment for the supply of aggregates to communities in the ISR.

CHAPTERTWO: CONTEXT

2.1 .. The lnuvialuit Settlement Region
The lnuvialuit are descendents ofthe Thule ,people and culture from northwestern

Afaska. The first known Thule settlement in Canada was otYBanks Island in approximately 1,00

A.D. (Canadian Museum ofCiviHzation Corporation, 2001). From·t his settlement,the tnuvialui1 culture evotvedj becoming adaptedto the environ. m ental characteristics of Canada's Western

Arctic{Morrison, 2008, Online). Historicalh~t a significant characteristic of the Jnuvi. aJuit cultur,

has been hunting-both on land, and at sea, for geese, muskox, caribou, fish and beluga whale (lnuvialuit Regional Corporation, 2007). Hunting served as the basis of the earty lnuvialuit economy, allowing for the production of food and clothing for survival Before : E uropean contact in the early 1800si there were six lnuviafuit Nations, with a total population ofapproximately 2,500. In 1861, the Hudson'sBayCompanyopened up a trading postfortrade with the lnuvialuit, and dosed it ln 1866 due to declining revenues. During this time however1 the lnuvialuit were plagued by disease including measles and smallpox, greatly diminishing the population in the 1870s. The turning point towards modernization of the lnuvialuit culture occurredinthe 1890s when whalers came to Herschel lslandto ·h unt bowhead whales. The lnuvialuit were no longer isolated . from the rest of the

world. Through the whalers, .goods such as flour and hunting equipment w.ere easily accessible and this newfound lack of isolation is said to have destroyed the traditionallnuvialuit culture. Just as the traders haddone, the whafers< introduced more disease, causing epidemics that diminished the lnuvialuit.population from 21 500 to 250 in 1905to 150 in 1910 (Canadian Museum ofCivHization Corporatjonl 2001).

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
The region's popu.lation has since recovered and grown to nearly 6,000people in 2006 (Statistics Canada, 2006). In 1984, the Canadian Parliament approved the Western Arctic Claims

Act and the lnuvialuit Final Agreement (IFA), giving the lnuvialuit ownership of land, with some
surface and subsurface rights to that land and creating the fnuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR}.

The ISR is located in Canada's Western Arctic and spans fro.m the Alaska-Yukortborder to
Victoria Island in the Beaufort Sea. With an area of 450,000 square kilometers~ the ISR indudes the Mackenzie Delta,. Victoria lstand and Banks island. There are six communities. that He within the ISR: Aklavik (population594), Jnuvik {3,484); Paulatuk (294), Sachs Harbour (122).. Tuktoyaktuk (870) and Ulukhaktok (formerly known as Hol.man) {398) (Statistics Canada, 200p).

The currentiSR populationconsists of both lnuvialuit and non-indigenous people who often
work in the natural resource and government sectors. Although lnuvik and Aklavik fan under the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. and are inhabited by both lnuvialuit and Gwkh'in people, they geographically fall within the Gwich'in Settlement Area (GSA) which is directly south ofthe lnuvialuit Settlement Region. Despite their locations within the GSA, the tand directly surrounding these communities is part of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. The boundaries of the

lSR are depicted in Figure 2.1.

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
2.2... Permafrost and Aggregatesin th~ Arctic:

2.2.1- Permafrost Characteristics
Permafrost is defined as subsurface material that remains frozen for two or more continuous years (Nelson, et aL, 2002}. Permafrost remains below zero degrees Celsius throughout the year, and is caused by the cooling of the ground inthe winter, which produces a ,frozen layer that iasts.throughout the following summer (Geological Survey of Canada, December 2007, Online). Between twenty and twenty-five percent of the entire earth'sland surface is underlain by permafrost, covering approximately 10.5 million squareldlometers. It is estimated tht:lt permafrost lies beneath fifty percent of Canada's totalland area (French, 2007; Stater and lawrence, 2005). Generally, permafrost is categorized in two ways: continuous ordiscontinuous. Areas

of continuous permafrost have frozen .ground everywhere beneath the ground surface. There
are two classifications of discontinuous permafrost: w.idespread zones that have permafrost under fifty to ninety percent of the land area, and sporadic zones, which have permafrost under ten to fifty percent of the land .area. The spatial distribution of permafrost zones in Canada is indicated in Figure 2.2. The lnuviaJuit Settlement Region lies within the continuous permafrost zone in Canada, and reaches depths ofbetween one hunpred and two. hundred metres in lnuvik and five hundred metres in Tuktoyaktuk
{Wolfe~

1998; Couture, et aL, 2002).

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT

·
Figure 2.2- Spatial Distribution and Continuity of Permafrost in Canada Source: Natural Resources Canada, 2001 Above the permafrost lies a layer of ground {the active layer, Figure 2.3}, which freezes

and thaws throughout the year with changes in season. In the continuous zone, the active laye sits immediately above the permafrost layer. In discontinuous permafrost zones, the active layer may be separated from the permafrost layer by a talik zone, which remains unfrozen

8

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
throughout the year, as seen in Figure 2.3 below (French, 2007, pg.lll). The thickness of the
active .layer is dependent on the air-surface temperature of the ground, which causes freezing and thawing. The active layerthkkness generally decreases as latitude increases, due to the fact that mean annual air temperature also decreases with higher latitude. The active layer
ranges from approximately one metre de.ep in the southern permafrost zones to ·fifteen

in the most northern latitudes (Andersland and tadanyi, 2004, pg. 7). Wi.thin the lnuviaJuitSettlement Region, the active layer is approximately haifa metre thickin
Tuktoyaktuk and one metre thick in lnuvik (Couture, etaL, 2002; French, 2007,pg. 178).

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
2.2.2- Ground Ice

Due to the nature of the Arctic climate, when moisture enters the ground from the atmosphere or from melting snow and ice on the surface, it eventually forms ground ice. The term ground ice refers to any ice formed in permafrost and the active layer, and occurs in

pores, cracks and cavities of the permafrost (French, 2007, pg. 153). The amount of ground ice present in the permafrost varies by region, and the lnuvialuit Settlement Region lies within a region of moderate (5-15%) to high (>15%) levels of ice content {Heginbottom, 2000). According to borehole samples that have been taken in the Tuktoyaktuk area, sixty-three percent of the sampled areas contain at least half a metre of massive ice within the upper ten metres of permafrost (Couture, et al, 2002). There are several types of ground ice that form in permafrost landscapes, induding ice

wedges, ice lenses and pore ice, the types which have the largest impact on ground movement related damage to infrastructure. ke wedges are some of the most distinctive features of a permafrost landscape, and are more prominent in the northern parts of the Arctic (French, 2007, pg. 176; Heginbottom, 2000). Ice wedges form inside cracks in the ground that are created when the ground contracts as the air temperature falls before winter. These cracks arc often less than a centimeter wide, but several metres deep. During the spring melt and summer precipitation period, water enters a crack and freezes during the following winter (Andersland and ladanyi, 2004, pg. 8). Some ice wedges may run as deep as twenty-five metre (fndian and Northern Affairs Canada, 1982}. When the top of an ice wedge thaws due to summer temperatures, a trough is usually formed in the ground that runs the length of the ice wedge (Couture and Pollard, 2007).

10

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
Pore ice forms when waterJrom precipitation or snowmeH: enters the soH matrix, and

stays ln the pores between the soH partides, eventually freezing. ·Research has indicated that
pore ice is more likely to form in finer soUs with smaHerpores at a shallower depth compared to

gravel with larger .Pore spaces {Fourie, eta I., 2007). Ice lenses are another type of ground ice and form when watertravels through the active layer towards the permafrost whereJt freezes and accumulates(Wolfe, 1998, pg. 18). The size of an ice lens increases as tong as there is a source of water in the soil, and can range from a few millimeters to ten metres thick (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 1982). Ice lenses are com.monly found in a series above one another,se.parated by a layer of.pennafrost
(Penner1 1962). Pingos are also common in the Mackenzie Delta a.nd especially on the

Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, occurring in shaUow Jakes (Heginbottom, 2000). Pingos are massive ground ice that is covered in soH and vegetation, and are caused by the freezing of shallow lakes ontop oftheirpermafrostlakebeds, creating uplift pressure in certain areas, resulting in
hill-like formations (Andersland,.·2004,pg.10). Whereas ice tenses.aregenerally invisible to the

eye and therefore. can have unexpected impacts on infrastructure, pingos are visible on the
landscape, and are avoided duringconstruction.

2.2.3- Ground Movement
When moisture .freezes to forrn ground ice, it expands in volume by nine percent (Wolfe, 1998, pg. 18). Conversely, when the ice thaws, it decreases in volume. The freeze-thaw
phenomenon ofground ice in permafrost causes ground to move, and is the most influential factor on the stability of infrastructure built on the surface above. The freezing and thawing

11

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
processes that cause movement of the ground that can impact infrastructure include: frost heave, thaw settlement and the formation of thermokarst landscapes (Wolfe, 1998; Anders! and and Ladanyi, 2004; Heginbottom, 2000). Frost heave occurs when the soil and the moisture within the soil freezes, creating ground ice that causes uplifting forces due to its volume expansion (Wolfe, 1998, pg. 19; Andersland and ladanyt, 2004, pg. 16). Heave is primarily attributed to the formation ofice lenses (French, 2007, pg.352). The magnitude of vertical expansion of the soil due to ice lenses has a wide range, but frost heave of four to eight inches is not uncommon (Penner, 1962). Thaw settlement (or thaw weakening) occurs as the ice melts in the spring, when the volumetric area once occupied by ice decreases and soil settles into this area (Wolfe, 1998, pg. 19). When an ice lens, pore ice or ice wedge melts, the moisture cannot penetrate underlying frozen ground. As a result, high pore-water pressure occurs, ultimately reducing the strength of the soil (French, 2007, pg. 242). A reduction in soil strength decreases its bearing capacity. As summer progresses, and the thaw depth increases, the pore-water pressure falls because the surplus water can dissipate further throughout the soil matrix, allowing the soil to regain some ofits strength and bearing capacity (Andersland and ·Ladanyi, 2004, pg. 39). In relation to thaw permafrost can be considered either thaw stable or thaw unstable, and this categorization is dependent on the amount of moisture within the frozen ground. The permafrost in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region can be thaw unstable due to the high amount of ground ice contained in the permafrost. Another process that impacts the stability of infrastructure is the formation of thermokarst landscapes. Thermokarst occurs when the melting of ground ice in the permafrost

12

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
causes the ground to settle, creating depressions in the ground. Melting.'that leadsto thermokarst landscapes is due to a rise in the ground surface temperature because of a changing climate, change in vegetation cover; or anthropogenic changes such as the construction of infrastructure on the permafrost (Anderstand and ladanyi, 20041 pg. 10). The thermokarst features that are created due to thawing depend onthetype of ground ice that is melting. When s.mall amounts of pore ice melt, shallow. depressions in the~ground>surface are created. However, when ice .wedges melt, troughs that runthe length.ofthe wedge are created across the ground surface. The me.lting and landscape changes are usuaHy exacerbat~d when the depressions or troughs fiJI with water to become shallow lakes because. precipitation or melt water cannot drain away (De Schutterr2004)~ Along With increases in

mean annual air temperature, the thaw ofpermafrostis also

influenced by disturbances in vegetation. Vegetation acts as an insulator. to the permafrost, and the removal of vegetatiorrfor the construction of roads,buHdingsor.pipelines.changesthe

thermal regime of the g.round. The presence of vegetation including trees, shrubs and peat can decrease permafrost degradation that is caused by air temperature (Yi,,et ai.J 2007). Uke vegetation, snow cover also serves as an insulator to the soH. ·Jn the spring it delays the warmingofthe soil as the air temperature rises. The greater the depth of snow the longer it

wiU take to melt, and this impacts how soon and how deep the permafrostwiUthaw in the
summer (Vi, .et at, 2007).

13

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
2.3- Permafrost Engineering

Infrastructure is defined by the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment as ((facilities with permanent foundations or the essential elements of a community" (lnstanes, 2004). Infrastructure is related to community socio-economic well being and for the purposes of this project} only community infrastructure is studied. Aside from community infrastructure like housing, schools, medical facilities, roads, airstrips, and utility lines, other infrastructure in the Arctic serves as natural resource extraction and military support (lnstanes, et ai., 2005).

2.3.1- Significance of Granular Resources
Gravel ts used extensively in northern communities as a construction material, serving as a base for infrastructure such as roads and pipelines as welt as an abatement measure, preventing the thaw of underlying permafrost and damage to infrastructure that is related to ground movement (French, 2007, pg. 353).

Most northern infrastructure is underlain by a gravet pad. The purpose of a gravel pad i twofold: to create a new active layer, and to prevent the warmth of the infrastructure from thawing the underlying permafrost (French, 2007, pg. 353). By creating a layer of aggregates ·before a building is constructed, a new, non-frost susceptible active layer is created (Strub, 1996). The frost susceptibility of soil refers to its likelihood of increasing in volume due to freezing, on account of its water content conductivity (Padilla, et al., 1997). The existing active layer usually consists of materials that are fine grained and more densely distributed, which makes it more difficult for water to travel through the soil, hence making the formation of ground ice and frost susceptibility more probable (Andersland, 2004, pg. 39).

Without ke content, infrastructure damage caused by the types of~ ground movement previously described is less likely. :In order to prevent thaw of the underlying permafrost andthe.ground movement associated With thaw, gravel pads of two to three metres thick are usually required. The pad should also extend at least one and a half metres beyond the building footprint, in order to deter thaw caused by roof runoff, or radiating heat (Strub, 1996). A gravel pad for a building should be laid during the surnmer months, when the gravel is thawed, and can be compacted. It can take a year for a pad to settle. and to take on the characteristics andfunction of a new active·layer. During the cours.eofthe·year, the·permafrost table is expected to rise to a level just above the original ground surface (Ibid).

2.3.2-ln/rastructvre
2.3.2.1-. Buildings.
Ught buildings, such as housing are buUt on piles in the Arctic. Piles are constructed of

either timber, steel, concrete or composite materials, serving the purpose of elevating the buHding off of the ground in order to reduce permafrost thaw caused by heat radiating from the building. By raising the building offthe ground, an airspace is created between the building and the ground, a !towing the heat produced by the building to be removed by moving air (Andersland and Ladanyi, 2004rpg. 179).

15

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
In the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, timber piles are commonly used due to their relative inexpensiveness, and the availability of timber from the Mackenzie Delta. Timber piles can range from six to fifteen metres in length, and from 15 to 25 centimetres in diameter atthe top · and from 30 to 35 centimetres at the bottom. Piles are installed by excavating a hole to the desired depth, inserting the pile, and then filling the hole with soil or backfilL Once the hole is filled and the ground refreezes, an adfreeze bond is created between the soil and the pile, giving the pile added strength and bearing capacity (French, 2007, pg. 352). Buildings buHt on piles are vulnerable to both frost heave and thaw settlement, both of which can compromise the integrity of the structure. During the winter, the uplifting forces of frost heave can lift a building and its piles above their original height. Then, during the spring thaw settlement occurs, allowing the building and pHes to move back to their original height (but not necessarily). If this occurs repeatedly to piJes, the building is subject to a.phenomenon known as frost jacking, causing extensive damage to the structure of the building, as the jacking of the piles may be different for each pile (Wolfe, 1998, pg. 19). Between the building and the permafrost, a gravel pad is laid in order to preserve the thermal regime of the frozen ground. The required thickness of a gravel pad to be effective can be calculated taking into consideration the thermal conductivity of the active layer and the gravel, and the mean annual air temperature. If too little gravel is used, the permafrost beneath the building will thaw (French, 2007, pg. 356).

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
regions, water and sewer lines run below ground, however if this method was implemented in the permafrost, the pipes would freeze, preventing services from being delivered. Likewise, if the pipes were heated underground to prevent freezing, the heat radiated form the utility lines would thaw the surrounding permafrost. The solution to the delivery of municipal services in the Canadian Arctic has ranged from burying and heating the pipes, and surrounding them with non frost susceptible gravel, to elevating the utility lines on piles above the permafrost, heating and encasing them in plywood or aluminum to create 'utilidors.' The first method has been employed in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, where the original utility fine system was constructed in 1908, and was built underground directly in the permafrost, and heated to keep the lines thawed. The utility lines subsequently experienced failure due to thaw settlement and frost heave. The second method of ground movement abatement for utility lines is utilidors, which were implemented in lnuvik when the town was constructed in the 1960s (French, 2007, pg.258). Utilidors also require a layer of gravel beneath them in order to prevent the heat from the utilidor from thawing the underlying permafrost. Both methods are expensive in terms of maintenance and upkeep, and hence they are only feasible in communities with larger populations. Smaller communities, including the five remaining lnuvialuit Settlement Region communities rely on individual water storage tanks and sewage holding tanks for buildings and homes, which are filled and emptied regularly.

2.4- The Impacts of Climate Change on Permafrost and Infrastructure in the Arctic 2.4.1- Arctic Climate Change

The most important factor in the distributi.on and disposition of permafrost in the north is climate. According to Overpeck, et al. (1997), the Arctic dim ate has been characterized by warming, causing glacial retreat, sea-ice melt and permafrost thaw for the past four hundred years. However, the rate of change has been incomparable to any other period since the beginning of the current interglacial period, which began 10,000 years ago. The dim ate of the Canadian Arctic has been increasingly changing over the past 50 years {Furgal and Prowse, 2008, pg.S9). The greatest temperature increases have been observed over the western Arctic, with a change of 2°C to 3°C over the past 50 years (Zhang, et at., 2000 in Furgal and Prowse, 2008, pg.61). In the Mackenzie District, specifically between 1948 and 2005 there was a warming of 2°C, while the average increase for Canada over the same period was 1.2°C (Furgal and Prowse, 2008, pg. 67). The annual temperatures in lnuvik have increased by 3°C since the 1940s, and it is suggested that the temperature increases are even more pronounced with higher latitudes (NWT ENR, 2008). Furthermore, between 1950 and 1998 in the western Arctic there were fewer extreme low temperature days and more extreme high temperature days during winter, spring and summer (Bonsai, et al., 2001 in Furgal and Prowse, 2008, pg. 67). Based on various global climate models and scenarios, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

20

TW.O: ·CONTEXT
Change suggests that the entire. Arctic· region could warm< between 2 and 9°Cby the year 2100,
(Anisimov} et al., 2007), The Mackenzie Delta alone could see an incr.ease in mean annual air

temperatureofbetween4 and5°Cby~2050 (Couture, et at, 2002).

2.4.2q Climate Change. anclPermafrost

The implication of a ch~nging climate on permafrost wllt be the thickening of,the active Jayer,>thethawingofpermafrost and the melting of ground ice causedhy an increaseinthe mean .annual surface temperature Onstanes, 2004}. Furthermore, the entire Arctic permafrost zone wiH decrease in extent, by approximately twenty-two. percent by 2050 .and ninety percent

by 2l.OO,.ifdimate .change occurs as predicted {Heginbottom, 2000; Anislmov and Nelson, 1997;
Lawrence and Slater, 2005). A study.using two global dimate models incUcatesthat if there mean annual ten1perature increase of 4.9 to 65 degrees Celsius due to climate change, the
summer thaw season in the Canadian high Arctic could extend bytwenty.. six days. Due to an

a

extended thaw season;the depth ofthaw could also increase by twelve to seventy centimeters (Couture and Pollard, 2007). Because the permafrost of the MackenzieVaUey is considered

moderatelyto highly sensitive to climate change, these impacts could be feitto their full extent
in the lnuviatuit SettlementRegion {Couture, et at., 2003).
Based upon the Hadley climate n1odel with a moderate emissions scenario for

greenhouse gases, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (2004} states that areas around the Arctic ocean (tikeTuktoyaktuk, Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour, andUiukh~ktok in the.ISR)and
populated areas further inland such as lnuvik and Aklavik have high potential for dimate change
induced infrastructure damage (Hassol, 2004). It has been noted that the magnitude of the

21

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
impacts of dim ate change on geomorphic processes in permafrost landscapes have been largely unresearched (Couture and Pollard, 2007; Yi, et al., 2007). However, it is realized that climate change related changes to the cryosphere will have negative implications for infrastructure of aU kinds (Furgal and Prowse, 2008, pg. 59)

2.4.3- Climate Change and Community Infrastructure The impacts of permafrost thaw may be devastating to community infrastructure. If the active layer thickens, the stabifity of infrastructure including roads, airstrips, pipelines and foundations will be compromised. Couture, et al. (2003) concluded that if permafrost thaws due to climate warming, many building foundations will lose their strength and settle, and pilings will be susceptible to frost heave. Roads and highways, as well as airfields and runways

will require more maintenance because of damage due to thaw-induced settlement of the
ground. linear infrastructure, such as pipelines will experience more vertical displacement due to frost heave and thaw, requiring more maintenance and repairs (Couture, et al., 2003). The impacts of dimate change on infrastructure are primarily a function of how much ice lies within the permafrost and is susceptible to increased thaw (Couture/ et al., 2002).

2.4.3.1- Buildings Building foundations are already highly affected by ground movement, and these ground movements wiU be exacerbated by climate change. Furthermore, the bearing capacity of the piles on which the buildings sit may be reduced as the active layer thickens, as less of the

22

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
pile wiUhe within the permafrost, and hence there will be less adfreeze bond strength between
the ground andthe pH.e (Couture, et al., 2002).

Some engineering firms have incorporated the consideration .of dim ate change
scenarios into their design plans for buildings. EBA Engineering Consultants ttd., is a company
thatprovides·engineering and scientific consulting services including Arctic engineering

services. EBAhas put into practice a procedure which takes dimate change into consideration

fort he design of infrastructure on permafrost. The procedure in dudes screeningthe situation
for·dimate·changerisks, including infrastructure sensitivity to climate change, or permafrost

sensitivity to infrastructure presence .. ·once the vulnerabilities to dlmate change are identified,. the consequences ofsuch change are examined, defining the risk that climate change poses on a project (Hayley, 2004, Online).
An example of dim ate change consideration for infrastructure within the lSRwas the

construction of the lnuvik Regional Health Centre which was completed in 2002 in lnuvik.
Through the screening principles described .above, it was determined that permafrost

sensitivity under the health centre was high,because of the presence of shallow ground ice in the lnuvlk area. Because of these ground characteristics, the risk of failure was rated as major or
medium~high because the

structural desig.n ofthe health centre could not withstand

movements caused by permafrostlhawand ground settling, as well as the·fact that hospital dosure would have significant impacts on the communities it serves {Hayley, 2004, Online).

Once the risk ofdimate change related infrastructure faUure·was determined, a
different type of foundation was selected. Before the alternative foundation design was put

into practice.. it was evaluated under three dim ate change scenarios which were based on

23

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
lnuvik air temperature records in order to anticipate the long term trends of the foundation design (Hayley, 2004, Online). As opposed to the traditional timber or steel pile supports generally used in lnuvik for foundations, an alternative technology of thermosyphons was employed for the health centre.

2.4.3.2- Roads and Airfields The economic activities of the lnuvialuit Settlement Region depend highly on the Dempster Highway that leads to lnuvik from the south. If the highway fails due to permafrost settlement, vehicles carrying goods and resources will not be able to reach the community by surface routes, and will necessitate air transport. This would put economic strain on the community as air transport is much costlier than ground transport, and the goods are unavailable locally. Infrastructure for air transport is also cruciat because the other five ISR communities are isolated from road transport networks, with the exception of Tuktoyaktuk and Aklavik which are accessible in the wi.nter by ice road. Therefore, the airstrips must be maintained in order to ensure that goods can be received by communities. The impacts of

dim ate change are quickly observable in roads and airstrips (Couture, et al., 2003). Both frost
heave andthaw settlement that naturally occur over the course of a year will be exacerbated by dim ate change, decreasing the quality of roads for transportation (Hassol, 2004) There are several methods that could be employed in order to abate road and airstrip failure due to permafrost degradation. The method most commonly used to reduce road settlement in the Northwest Territories is to remove one to one and a half metres of frostsusceptible soil and fill the area with gravel (Wolfe, 1998, pg. 24). Alternative methods of

24

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
abatement indude the us.e of polystyrene to insulate a road embankment,reducing the heat intake of the underlying grou.nd during the summer and reducing the heat extracted from the ground during the winter.

is also possible to ventilate the road embankrnentpy placing air

ducts within the embankment .perpendicular to the road. During. the winter, h~at is extracted from the embankm.ent using convection when the wind passes through the air ducts.. In the summer, the ducts are dosed (Beaulac, etal., nd). More expensive technologies, such as thermosyphons canbe used under roads and airstrips, but these workonly in the winter when the underlying soil is warmer than the air. 'It has been estimatedthat the present cost of repairing transportation ·infrastructure damaged by. climate change is $1 million,peryear in the Northwest Territories (NWT ENR,.. 2008~ Online).

2.4.4- Observations ofln/rastructure Damage and Climate Change

Impacts of climate. change on permafrost and infrastructure have already.been observed through both scientific traditional ,knowledge. The thaw depth of the

permafrost in the Mackenzie Delta has been measured by the Geologi.cal Survey of Canada, and it has been found that the depthshave increased between 1993 and 2.003. This is due to an overan increase in permafrost temperature, which was observed to be approximately 0.1 . degree Celsius per yearinthe 1990s·(Couture, etal., 2003}. This pattern of increased thaw depth due to increased permafrost temperature wiU only continue asthe mean annual air tem.perature in the western Arctic increases. Discussion with Neil Macleod from EBA Consultants,
ltd.~

has indicated that the amount of gravel used for the construction of new

infrastructure has alread.y increased by fifteen to twenty .percent {Macleod, 2008, Interview).

25

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
Overall, researchers have conduded that the timeframe and magnitude of permafrost degradation due to climate change is relatively uncertain (Heginbottom, 2000). The most drastic impacts on community infrastructure that have been observed and recorded in the Arcticthus far are in Russia. Buildings and transportation infrastructure alike have been either deformed ordestroyed by permafrost thaw that is said to be induced by climate change. Yakutusk, Russia has seen the damage of over 300 buildings dueto thawsettlement. In other areas, railway lines have been distorted, runways have become unusable, and pipelines have broken (Hassol, 2004). Within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, infrastructure failure occurs but is not necessarily recorded. However, some researchers, such as Couture, Robinson and Burgess (2000) suggest that roads, foundations, utHities and embankments have suffered damage related to permafrost thaw due to natural and anthropogenic changes throughout the Mackenzie Valley. During an interview Kurt Wainman of Northwind Industries, limited, in lnuvik was able to point out an instance of thaw settlement underneath a utHidor that was constructed only several years prior (Figure 2.4) (Wainman, 2007, Interview).

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
In the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, traditional knowledge (the knowledge of the Inuit people who have been Hving on the land for generations) and observations about the changing environment have also been recorded by researchers. Aklavik residents have observed that shorter winters are causing permafrost to thaw sooner. Shorter winters area also known to impact the amount of time available for transportation across the tundra and frozen water (Jozic, 2005). Residents of lnuvik have reported increasing disappearance of permafrost, and increased depth of the active layer (Nickels, et at, 2002), while residents of Tuktoyaktuk have observed melting permafrost. Residents of Sachs Harbour have observed longer and warmer summers, and shorter, warmer winters. They have also observed an increased depth in the active layer of permafrost after the spring thaw (Nickels, etal, 2005; Berkes and Jolly, 2001).

2.5- Aggregates in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region
Undoubtedly, granular resources are essential to lnuvialuit Settlement Region communities. Their importance was made evident in the planning of the community of lnuvik . . In 1954, the federal government's department of Northern Affairs and National Resources set outto identify a site for the community, which would serve as the new government centre for the western Arctic (Stoneman~McNichol, 1983, pg. 7). The existing centre, Aklavik, was found to be sinking due to flooding and melting permafrost. The federal government chose to relocate the majority of the 1,500 residents and government services ofAklavik tolnuvik which would be built to be more stable, withstanding environmental change (Jozic, 2005). One of the primary criteria for selecting the site for lnuvik was its proximity to sources of .gravet which would be used for infrastructure construction and maintenance (Stoneman-

28

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
McNichol, 1983; Johnson, 2006). As such, asite fort he town was chosen near aJarge source of glado-fluvial gravel which lay a few kilometers away from the town. Since the town 1 s concepti.on, gravel has served as a vital resource-the entire town was built upon a continuous gravetpad (French, 2007, pg. 358).

The lnuvialuitFinal Agreement,, implemented in 1984, was created in order to give the
lnuvialuitpeople guaranteed rights from the Government of Canada, including those to land and wildli·fe management. The goals of the/FA were to preserve the lnuvialuit cultural identity,
to enabie the lnuvialuit to be equal and meaningful participants in the northern and national

economy and society, and to protect and preserve the Arctic ·wHdHfe and environment. <In attempt to ensure that the.goat,of socio-economic success ofthe ,lnuvialuit people is achieved, the guidelines for the .management of resources are set out in the JFA. The document sets out three priorities for the management of granular resources in thelnuvialuit Settlement Region, which are summarized as follows:
1. Thelnuvia.luit should reserve enough . sandandgraveJ·ofappropriate qi.Jalityand within

reasonable transportdistances on lnuvialuit Jands to meet the public community needs
in the lSR and inuvik, based on 20 year forecasts of the volumes requiredfrom lnuvialuit

lands prepared by the lnuvialuit and other appropriate levels of governmentthat should
be updated nolessfrequently than·every 5 years{lFASection·7(27.))
2. Thelnuvialuit should reserve enough sand and gravel of appropriate quality on

lnuvialuit lands forprivate and corporate needs of the lnuvialuitpeople, and not for sale.. based on 20 year forecasts of required volumes prepared by the lnuvialuit Land

Administration (I FA Section 7(28))
29

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
3. The lnuviaJuit should make available sand and gravel for projects approved by appropriate government agencies (!FA Section 7(29))

The /FA makes Jt dear that there is interest in gravel from a number of stakeholders. Granular resources are required for meeting public community needs-for infrastructure construction and maintenance (such as transportation routes and building foundations) carried out by the Government of the Northwest Territories or Municipal and Community Affairs. Furthermore, after granular resource requirements for public needs are met, gravel is also required for the private and corporate interests of the lnuvialuit people. This includes the use of gravel for construction purposes at their private dwelling, as welt as for construction for their business operations and developments. For example, an lnuvialuit owned construction business may require a gravel pad for their construction equipment to be stored upon, or an lnuvialuit business may use gravel to develop a subdivision or apartment building. Finally, if public and private demands are met, the lnuvialuit have an interest in making gravel available for projects approved by government agencies, such as the Mackenzie Gas Project which may be approved by the federal government. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) and Municipal and Community Affairs (MACA) also have an interest in gravel for infrastructure development and maintenance. Community governments (MACA) are responsible for obtaining granular material for the construction of infrastructure such as arenas, community centres, firehalls, garages, retirement homes, health care offices, visitor centres, schools, sewage lagoons, and water supply systems. The GNWT requires gravel for projects that are carried out and funded by the territorial

30

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
government, such as transportation routes and airfields. All of these projects faU under thefirst priority (Section 7(27)) of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. Furthermore, the federaLgovernment also has interest in.gravel for its own projects such as the constructionofgovernmentbui.ldings. Recognizing the significance of gravel and the range of stakeholder interests, granular resource forecasts are required by the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. Theseforecasts are reports about the granular resou rc:e demands of specific users over a certain length oftirne .. They can contain information from both public and private users, and encompass a timeframe of several years, with forecasts for .future demand. Granular resource demands. estimated in the report are for operation and mai.ntenance ofexisUng infrastructure, the construction of new infrastructure, and for proposed infrastnJcture whkh may or may not be approved .yet. A forecast also includes information about what type ofgranutar resources are required, and where they are proposedto come from. Since the lnuvialuit FinalAgreement was implemented in 1984, fourgranular resource demand forecasts have been condu.cted (1987, 1991, 1995 and 2001) in an attemptto meet the requirements of Section 7{27). The forecasts have been conducted intermittently, rather than at five year intervals as required by the IFA, and there has been no update within the last seven years. The Government oft he Northwest Territories conducted its own Territorial Granular
Resource Forecast Jn 2007, but it accountsfor only a portion of the entire demand within the

lnuviaiuit Settl~ment Region. The lack of consistency in conducting granular resource forecasts at regu.iar intervals for .aU levels of interest is symptomatic of the issues that hinder the management of granular resources in the region.

31

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
In order to ensure that demands for gravel can be met in a sustainable manner, the maintenance of a gravel supply inventory would be very useful, but this is not required by the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. However, the estimation of gravel supply is not easy and is regularly inaccurate because it is too expensive to carry out ground reconnaissance, and estimates are largely made based on air photos. Supply inventories only take into account gravel where it is demanded, for example, near communities, or private natural resource development sites where reconnaissance is funded by the developer (Gowan, Personal Communication, 2007). Furthermore, it is highly likely that gravel is removed from borrow sources without permits, which makes it impossible to monitor how much gravel remains in the community gravel supplies (Romaine, Personal Communication, 2007). The existence of gravel does not necessarily makeit a viable source of supply to a community. Major physical and environmental constraints may prevent a plentiful source of high quality gravel from being developed and extracted, and these constraints may ultimately limit the overall supply of gravel. Physical constraints to developing granular borrow sources in dude excessive overburden over the deposit or excessive ice or moisture, preventing gravel from being economically and easily extracted. The preservation of wildlife and the surrounding physical environment must also be maintained while developing and extracting gravel in the Jnuvialuit Settlement Region, in order to achieve one of the overlying principles of the lnuvialuit Fino/Agreement: to uprotect and preserve the Arctic wildlife, environment and biological productivity" for the traditional activities of the beneficiaries (lnuvialuit Regional Corporation, Online, 2007). The supply of gravel is thus also limited by ecologically sensitive areas, including wildlife migration and breeding grounds, as well as those susceptible to soH erosion, destruction

ofpermafrost, and soH or water contamination (Northern Granular Resources Program, May,

Uncertainties AboutGravelin the lnuvialuit Settlement Region
Despite its fundamentat importance to community growth and wellbeing.~ resource

managers and members of the granular resource industry alike agree thatgravet is one oft he most mismanaged resources in the lnuvialuitSettlementRegion (Personal Communication, 2007, 2008). At the outset of this project, lengthy interviews were conducted with two people who had expert knowledge aboutgranularresoUrces in the ISR: Robert Gowan, Manager of land Programs for indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), and Todd RomairH~, Chief Land Administrator ofthe lnuviafuittandAdministration. Robert Gowan has been involved with granular resources in the north since the inception of his career in the 1970s, testingfor and evaluating aggregates. AtlNAC, 'Mr. Gowan has played a major role in Arctic granutar resource studies and management plans~ including the lnuvialuit Final Agreement Implementation Plan. Mr. Gowan highlighted that the management of granular resources has been a longstanding issue facing the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. From his perspective, some of the major obstades to developing a successful granular resources management plan are:

·

A Jack·of coordination between governmental bodies to meet the priorities of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement including regular demand forecasts.

·

An undear picture of now much gravel is available to the communities, because the supply inventory is primarily based on where devetopment activity exists.

33

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
· A high staff turnover and overstretched staff make it difficult to advance the development and implementation of a granular resources management plan in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region.

Todd Romaine is the current Chief land Administrator for the tnuvialuit land Administration (I LA), which, as part of its mandate oversees the allocation of granular resources on lnuvialuit Private land. From the perspective of the lnuvialuit Land Administration, gravel is the most important resource management issue facing the ILA. Some of the defining issues of granular resource management in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region are:

·

Granular resource borrow sites within dose proximity to the communities have been depleted, and it is expensive and difficult to access further sources.

·

The lack of a regional framework and coordination between the lnuvialuit and the Territorial and Federal governments makes the sustainable allocation and management of granular resources difficult.

·

There will be increased demands for gravel in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region in the near future with the development of the Mackenzie Gas Project, and the possible lnuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway. There may also be increased demands for gravel due to climate change.

It is apparent from a literature review and discussion with land managers that there is a lack of critical information on aggregate resource management in the !SR. Crucial to determining how granular resources should be managed, especially in the face of climate change is an understanding of how the ownership of gravel is distributed in the lnuvialuit

34

CHAPTER TWO.: CONTEXT
Settlement Region, and how gravel is obtained from these land owners .. There is no document available with consolidated ·information about who has ownership of what gravel, and what the regulatory process is .for developing and obtaining gravel as an end userfrom each of these owners. Without this .information, it is difficult to identify whether the process by which gravel is obtained in the lSR matches the way legislation dictates and whether licensing, monitoring and enforcement ofgravelextraction follows legislation. Also lacking is an accurate supply inventory ofgravel, and a current demand forecast of the gravel required by users within the region. Both of these are essentiattools for the sustainable altocationof resources in the face of future demand and dim ate change. Without the above information it is difficult to produce a prognosis for granular resources in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. This hinders the development of a management plan which can minimize community vulnerability to a changing environment in .which granular resources are in short supply and high demandfor.infrastructure construction and maintenance.

CHAPTER TWO: CONTEXT
2.7~ Research Questions

From reviewing literature and discussions with land managers, several research questions became apparent, highlighting what needs to be known about the impacts of climate change on the availability of gravel resources in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region:

a} What are the current interests in granular resources? How are they regulated and obtained compared to how legal frameworks describe the process? b) How wilt the demand for gravel for use in infrastructure construction and maintenance be affected by climate change? c) How will the supply and availability of gravel be impacted by climate change? d) How can the management regime for granular resources adapt to address issues arising from climate change?

The answers to these questions serve the purpose of ultimately answering the project research question: What are the implications of climate change for the availability of granular resources in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region?

36

CHAPTER THREE: :METHODOLOGY
3.1- Objectives
For this paper, it is clear that several questions must be answered in order to develop a consolidated account of the state of granular resources in the ISH at present, and how supply and demand may change with a warming climate. Ultimately, the management of granular resources in such a way that reduces community vulnerability is dependent on information that is not yet researched or consolidated. What is not known is how climate change will specifically impact the infrastructure in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, how the supply of and demand for gravel. to abate .infrastructure failure wm change with climate change, and how the management of gravel wm need to be adapted in order to accommodate these changes. The impact that climate change will have on infrastructure in the ISR is uncertain, due to the fact that there have been very few ISR-spedfic studies conducted and most of these studies are at a broader spatial scale. However, a hypothesis of the manner in which infrastructure may be impacted by climate change is developed in this paper by drawing upon secondary information from Arctic-wide impact assessments, ISR focused studies, and primary information from people living and working in the ISR who have observed infrastructure failure due to a changing environment. Before determining the factors impacting the availability of granular resources in the region, it is necessary to deconstruct and understand the management regime of granular resources in the ISR. With three resource owners and various factors (i.e. cost and distance) affecting a user's decision-making process about where and from whom to obtain gravel, the seemingly simple process of obtaining gravel can be complex. Chapter 4 draws upon

CHAPTER THREE: M . ETHODOLOGY
information from government documents induding Acts and Regulations, and Pits and Quarries Guidelines from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (1NAC, 1982) for the purpose of detaiHng the process of obtaining granutarresources from the different land owners from the beginning (.permit application) to the end (site remediation). tn order for granular resource managers to allocate grave~ in a sustainabte manner and in accordance with the priorities ofthelnuvialuitfinal Agreement, information about the disposition ofthe gravel sources within the tSR is necessary. · The existing gravel inventory of the lnuviatuitland Administration contains data about the amount of gravel in each known source, : t he season and method of access to,t he pits, and physical or environmental constraints to developing the pits. This information is used irtcombination with static maps to devetop a set ofmaps inaGeographiclnJormation System {GJS)thatallows for theanatysis of how the supplyofgra\lel could be impacted by climate change. The potential impacts :ofdimate change on supply are analyzed based on the suggestions of secondary literature and .expert information from interviews abouthow dim ate change will impact seasonal transportation methods, ground ice melt, and ultimately the abi.litytoobtain gravel. The other primary variable for consideration in granular resources management is demand for graveL A demand forecast for aU levels of jurisdiction withinthe lnuvtatuit Settlement Region does not exist, making the allocation of resources difficult and uncertain because the presentand future demand for gravelis unclear. Using aU available demand information from govern.ment .a nd private gravel users, an accot1ntofwhat is known about demand is developed. This is done throughthe consofidation of.avaHahte data about the

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
Agreement. Furthermore, secondary information and interviews with infrastructure planners

and engineers are used to hypothesize the magnitude of increased demand that will be placed on gravel due to climate change. This information is crucial to the future development of granular resource demand forecasts that will be essential for managing gravel in the face of climate change. Through the use of primary and secondary information, this project aims to fill the research gaps that exist about granular resources in the lnuviafuit Settlement Region. In trying to fill these gaps, the obsta des that hinder the management of granular resources, such as a rack ofdemand forecast participation, or an inconsistent supply inventory emerge.

3.2-- Secondary Information

Secondary .information was used in this report to develop a framework for answering the research questions, identifying what is known about granular resources and their management in the ISR, and in doing so, highlighting what is unknown and must be discovered through primary research. Furthermore, secondary information is synthesized in this project to create information that can be used for critical analysis of the supply of, demand fori and management of graveL The secondary research for this project draws upon governmental reports, legislative documents, consulting reports, journal articles and data from administrative bodies. Climate change reports and impact assessments including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes's Fourth Assessment Report (2007), the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (2004), the Northwest Territories/ Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Report (2008); and

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
regulations was later compared to primary accounts (through interviews) of how gravel is actually obtained by granular resource users. In comparing the theoretical and actual processes, gaps in the monitoring of gravel extraction and enforcement of regulations were identified. The knowledge of historical and present supply of and demand for granular resources is crucial to managing granular resources as the climate warms. According to the lnuvialuit Final
Agreement, demand forecasts for granular resources in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region are to

be completed every five years, forecasting for the twenty years ahead. Historically, these forecasts have not been carried out as often as required by the IFA due to various constraints. The forecasts, which were completed by consulting companies including EBA Engineering Consultants, Ltd. (1987), Hardy BBT, Ltd. (1991), and North of 60 Engineering, Ltd. (1995 & 2001), were obtained. In reviewing the historical granular resource forecasts that have been carried out for the ISR, constraints that have diminished the accuracy and timeliness of the reports were identified. The constraints faced in the past are indicative of the issues faced by current granular resource managers in completing forecasts. These constraints translate to obstacles that must be overcome in order to develop accurate forecasts that wiiJaid the management ofgravet in the face of climate change. Furthermore, a database of historical demand was derived based on available data about quarry activity in the ISR since the implementation of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement in 1984. Historical data about quarry licenses issued by the lnuvialuit Land Administration were obtained for the years 1984-2000 from a North of 60 Engineering, ltd. report (2001), and for the years 2000-2007, from an lnuvialuit land Administration database.

Communication). For the purposes of this project, the use of a GIS allows for the practical analysis of the gravel supply,. taking into account constraints to accessibility and development, as well as constraints caused by dimate change. In order to create maps to be used for spatial analysis/ the locations of the granular resource sites were plotted on Northwest Territories boundary shapefiles through heads-up digitizing. The location maps were then joined to the supply inventory database, which contains information about the amount of granular resources available at the site1 and constraints to developing the site such as ice within the ground, poor quality, sporadic deposits, wildlife or environmental significance, or seasonal inaccessibility. Once the maps were joined to the supply database, the granular resource borrow sites were buffered at increments of 10, 15, 20 and further increments of 10 kilometres each. An initial buffer of 10 kilometres was implemented because a hauling distance of greater than 10 kilometres is considered 11 1ong distance" in the Territorial Granular Resource Forecast (2007). Through buffering, the number of pits within a reasonable hauling distance of the communities became apparent. Once categorized by distance from their respective community, the pits were identified as "unconstrained" or ~~constrained" to development and extraction of granular material. If a pit had year-round access to gravel, as well as no constraints to development, it was considered
~~unconstrained/'

meaning that it was feasible to develop. Those pits that had

only seasonal access, and/or constraints to development were considered "constrained/' meaning that they are developable, but it would be less feasible and/or more expensive to do so. This categorization allowed for the analysis of which pits are actually feasibl·e and hence

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
desirable sources of granular material, and how far a user must travel to obtain materie:lls of the appropriate quality for their project.
tn order to determine which of the feasible sources could be made inaccessible or

undevelopable due to warmer temperatures, further constraint analysis was carried out. If a source W(1saccessihle . year round, and had no constrafnts to development, ;;as wen as no massive ground ice with the potential to melt vvith .warmh1g temperatures, it was considered

through literature, and to realize the concerns held by the people of the ISR about how dim ate change may impact their communities in regards to infrastructure and granular resources. The information obtained from the interviews was then integrated into the report in order to support discussion of community vulnerability and potential adaptations of granular resource management to climate change.

3.5- Field Work
For approximately three weeks in August, 2007, field work was carried out in the lnuvialuitSettlement Region. Travelling to the ISR allowed for the collection of both primary and secondary information as well as for gaining a first-hand perspective of the operations of northern communities. Jn order to carry out research in the ISR, a research Hcense was obtained from the Aurora Research Institute as required by the NWT Scientists Act. Relevant organizations within the study area were given the opportunity to approve the research and provide feedback or requests. Not only lnuvialuit organizations were contacted, because lnuvik, the primary location for research consists of Gwich'in and Metis populations as well, who all contribute to the socio-economic situation ofJnvuik. The organizations consulted for the research license included: the City of Yellowknife, the Gwich'in Sociat and Cultural fnstitute, Hamlet ofTuktoyaktuk, lnuvialuit Community Development Division, lnuvialuit land Administration, lnuvik Community Corporation, lnuvik Metis, Nihtat Gwich'in Council, North Slave Metis, Northwest Territories Metis Nation, Town of lnuvik, Tuktoyaktuk Community Corporation and Yellowknife Dene First Nation.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
resources. Upon arrival in lnuvik, M ike Harlow and Kyle Sherwin of the inuvialuit land Administration provided an update of the status of granular resource management in the ISR, and provided initial contacts for interviews. When conducting research about a topic that includes a broad range of stakeholders from various industry backgrounds, networking is an essential resource. For example, the land administrators issue permits for gravel extraction and therefore can identify gravel pit developers who may be useful to interview. Meanwhile, gravel pit devetopers may be able to identify those who are demanding gravel for infrastructure development. The granular resources industry in the ISR is complex because there are many stakeholders from different backgrounds with interests in granular resources. The individual. stakeholders can be classified into the following four categories:

1. Granular Resource Management- Participants in this category are involved in the issuing of permits and licenses for extracting gravel, monitoring gravel supply, orforecasting demand for granular resources. Their interests are in regulating the use ofgranular resources, as well as determining whether there will be enough supply to meet the demands of communities and ofprivate entities within the ISR. Granular resource managers may have concerns about the current management system for granular resources. They :may also have observations about whether impacts of cfjmate change on the demand for granular resources have already been observed, and what changes could be made to management practices to accommodate the impacts ofdimate change.

47

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
constraints that may conflict with the values of the lnuvialuit people. Community government members may suggest ways in which the communities are/should be adapting to the potential impacts of dimate change on granular resources demanded by vulnerable infrastructure.

Potential respondents were identified in two ways. In March of 1999, a Granular
Resources Directory was published by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern

Development. The purpose of the directory was to assist governing bodies with the sustainable development of granular resources by identifying stakeholders from all backgrounds. This directory was useful for obtaining contact information for stakeholders relevant to this project including construction companies, extractors, haulers, engineering consultants and people in government roles. Bob Gowan (INAC, Ottawa) was able to provide contact information for stakeholders in government positions that were knowledgeable of the granular resources situation in the Northwest Territories and the ISR.. As well, once interviews were conducted, the interviewees often provided suggestions for further contacts that may be of interest. Once identified, stakeholders were contacted through e-mail or by telephone in order to determine whether they would be willing to participate in the interview process. Interviews were conducted in person during the field visit in August, 2007, or by email response or telephone between 2007 and 2008. The stakeholders who participated in the interview process included Bob Gowan of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Todd Romaine, Mike Harlow and Kyle Sherwin of the

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
were asked for their observations, if any, about environmental changes that are already occurring and impacting their operations. Finally, questions were asked about how they predicted their businesses could adapt to a changing climate. The participants from the infrastructure planning, construction and maintenance category were asked questions intended to gain a perspective about the importance of gravel in the construction of infrastructure in the ISR. Furthermore, questions were asked about the relative advantages of granular resources compared to other technologies for insulating permafrost. Since these people have knowledge of specific projects, they were asked for their observations about the impacts of.dimate change on infrastructure, and whether they have experienced difficulties in obtaining gravel for projects. As well, the interviewees were asked about their expectations about what the additional requirements for granular resources will be for infrastructure construction with a warmer climate. The final category of respondents consisted of members of community government, who were not necessarily directlyrelated to the granular resources industry. These people were asked for their observations about concerns related to dim ate change, and specifically stresses on granular resources due to dim ate change. Community based stakeholders were asked about community concerns about gravel use, availability, and management, as well as whether the management of gravel should be an issue of top priority. As well, they were asked for suggestions about how the management of granular resources may need to change in order for communities to adapt to climate change. The information obtained through participant interviews was used throughoutthe report in order to provide insight where information could not be found in literature. As weiJ, it

CHAPTER FOUR: DECONSTRUCTING THE AGGREGATE MANAGEMENT REGIMES lN THE JSR
4.1- Land and Resource Jurisdiction

Within the 450,000 square kilometers of the tnuvialuit Settlement Region, there are three land owners: the lnuvialuit (lnuvialuit private lands), the Government of the Northwest Territories (Commissioner's lands), and the Federai Government of Canada (Crown lands). Jnuvialuit private lands comprise approximately twenty percent of the lands within the ISR. The lnuvialuit land Administration has jurisdiction over lnuvialuit private lands that fall under the categories of "7(1)(a)" and "7(1)(b)" lands as defined in the lnuvialuit Final
Agreement. 7(1)(a) lands refer to lands to which the lnuviatuit hold both surface and

subsurface rights, while 7(1)(b} lands refer to lands to which the lnuvialuit hold only surface rights. Surface rights were granted to the lnuvialuit for granular resources only/ while subsurface rights induderights to granular resources, as weU as oil, gas, other hydrocarbons, coal, sulphur and minerals. The dispersal of 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(b) fands can be seen in Figure 4.1. 7(1)(a) lands consist of approximately 13,000 square kilometers of land, which lie in 1,800 square kilometer blocks surrounding each of the six ISR communities. 7{1)fb) lands consist of 78,000 square kitometers which lie further afield from the communities. Nearly eighty percent of the land within the ISR belongs to the federal government. Crown lands within the ISR are administered by the Minister of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs and Northern Development. The Minister {lis responsible for resources in the Northwest Territories, and has control, management and administration of all lands situated in the Northwest Territories belonging to Her Majesty in right of Canada not under management, charge or direction of any other Minister or agency of the Government of Canada (INAC, 15

53

CHAPTER FOUR: DECONSTRUCTING THEAGGREGATE MANAGEMENT REGIMES IN THE
N. o vember2007, Online). The DtAND also administers the subsurface rights Private lands and subsurface rights for resources on Commissioner's lands. Commissioner's land is land which has been transferred from the Government of

tS'R

on 7(l)(b) Jnuvialurt

Canada to the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories. ·T his land accounts for two percent

of the land within the Northwest Territories. Commissioner's lands within the tSH are
administered by the lands Administration section of the Government oft he Northw. est Territories' Department of Municipal and.Community .Affairs. MACA administers·t he Commissioner's land by~' selling, leasing, or otherwise disposing of land withirl municipal

boundaries of communities in the Northwest Territories" (Government .o f the .N WT, nd, Online).
Thus, MACA is responsible forthe management of gravel on Commissioner's lands which is

used by the GNWTDepartments of Transportationand Public Works and Services.

the seven stages of obtaining gravel, based on the;existing legal frameworks fort he various
Jevefs ofjurisdiction. The process

has been portrayedvisu~Uy in flow-chartforrn9.t in Appendix

C, Diagram 1.

4.2.1· Explorqtion

tn the case that a newgranular resource borrow source is being sought out (for
example, for the Mackenzie Ga~ Project), the ,exploralionstage is necessary and< consists of field
research and measurement activities which are used to gain information .about the location of

the source and characteristics of the deposit. There are five .generat stages to geological

exploration induding literature research studies, field surveys; geoscientific studies, test drilling
and market feasibility studies.
The preliminary assessment of an area for granular resource potential does not require regulatory approval as it is non-invasive and involves the review qf published information which

may help to identify potential borrow sources. Research may also include communication with local community members and established sand and gravel developers in order to gain
information that may not have been puplished. Before CJ.i1Y further expl()ration mqy f?e done in

the fnuvialuit SettlementRegion, each of the jurisdictional-bodies has regulatory approval
requirements which must be achieved.

CHAPTER FOUR: DECONSTRUCTING THE AGGREGATE MANAGEMENT REGIMES IN THE ISR

4.2.1.1- On lnuvialuit Private Land
Appli.cations for Access Agreements, Participation Agreements and Cooperation Agreements, as well as for Land Use Permits must he submitted to the lnuvialuit Land Administration for approval. An Access Agreement grants the right to travel across lnuvialuit Private Lands and to exercise rights issued by the ILA other than those in the Participation Agreement. It is required for a Reconnaissance Permit, Quarry Concession, or Quarry License granted by the ILA (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (a), 2005}. A Participation Agreement is an agreement between the proponent andthe ILA, which sets out the rights and obligations for the ILA and the proponent about the proposed activities to be carried out on lnuvialuit lands. It must be obtained before the granting of a land Use Permit (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (a), 2005). A land Use Permit is.issued by the ILA, and allows for an operation tobe carried out on lnuvialuit Private lands. It permitstheuse of explosives, heavy equipment, drilling equipment and other granular resource development-related activities. It may be issued for a period ofup to two years (indian and Northern Affairs Canada (b), 2005). Before the applications for these permits and agreements are approved, consultation with the tocal community must occur. In the general consultation procedure, the assistant land administrator sends a memorandum and copy of the application to various parties of interest including: each member of the lnuvialuit land Administration Commission {!LAC), the local community corporation (CC), the local Hunters and Trappers Committee (HTC), and if necessary the inuvialuit Regional Corporation, lnuvialuit Game Council {IGC), the NWT Wildlife Management Advisory Council or the Wildlife Management Advisory Committee, the lnuvialuit Devetopment Corporation (I DC) and the Fisheries Joint Management Committee (FJMC).

4.2.1.2- On Commissioner's Land

In order to develop granular resources on or acquire them from Commissioner's land, it is necessary to apply for a land Use Permit. This will be screened by Municipal and Community Affairs (MACA). Any applications for use of Commissioner's tands are made to the lands officer in the community containing the land. Within MACA,the Lands Administration Directorate conducts the screening of the application, and if there are no significant negative environmental impacts, issues the permit. If there are environmental concerns, the application is sent for review by the Commissioner's land Review Committee which ensures that applications conform with the policies of the GNWT, including environmental policies (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (b), 2001).
4.2.1 .3- On Crown Land

Before continuing exploration for granular resources on CrownJand, an application must be made for a Land Use Permit to the District Manager of the Department oftndian and Northern Affairs North Mackenzie District in lnuvik. The land Use Permit authorizes temporary use of the land for activities associated with a quarrying, an dis designed to minimize environmental disturbance, containing conditions regarding environmental .protection of the location, the type and size of equipment used and restoration. A securitydeposit is required to acquire a Land Use Permit from DIAND. The application undergoes the community

consultation process and ISR Environmental Impact Screening and Review process as described in the lnuvialuit Private lands section (Section 4.2.1.1). If the application meets the approval of

CHAPTER FOUR: DECONSTRUCTING THE AGGREGATE MANAGEMENT REGIMES IN THE ISR
Seismic and electromagnetic systems are used to measure thickness and depth as well as the type of material lying beneath. After surveying is complete, a geological map is drawn of the location of the sand and gravel deposit, with a grid showing the location of the test pits and the results of the geophysical surveys. Once the feasibility of extracting gravel has been determined, further regulatory approvals are required before extraction can begin. These approvals vary by jurisdiction and are di~cussed below.

4.2.2- Preparation for Extraction 4.2.2.1- On Crown Land
A Land Use Permit (LUP) is required for quarrying on Crown lands for both new and existing pits. The lUP allows the temporary use of land (maximum three years) for activities associated with quarrying. The permit contains conditions about environmental protection of the location, timing ofthe operation, thetype and size of equipment that may be used, and abandonment and dean up ofthe site. Within the tSR, LUPs are authorized by the DrANDNqrth Mackenzie District, District Manager in lnuvik. In the case of a new pit, if the user intends to use the land for extracting resources for more than two years, they must obtain a Surface lease, which is required under the Territorial Lands Act. Whether or not a Surface lease is necessary, a Quarry lease is atso required for a new pit under the Territorial Quarrying Regulations in order for an individual to quarry a site for up to 10 years to remove granular resources (tndian and Northern Affairs Canada (c), 2005}. If a user intends to quarry an existing pit on Crown land, a Quarry Permit is required. A Quarry Permit allows a user to remove a specific amount of material from a certain piece of

61

extracted must he used or marketed immediately. The user must pay an annual rental fee for the lease, which may last for up to ten years, and must pay a royalty for material extracted. Any person can remove no more than forty cubic metres of gravel from Commissioner's land each year for personal use, without a permit or payment of royalties or fees (NWT Department of Justice, 1990).
4.2.2.3- On lnuvialuit Private Land

In order to develop a new quarry on lnuviatuit Private land, a Quarry Concession must be obtained from the lnuvialuit land Administration, which grants the right to develop a quarry and extract gravel on a piece of lnuvialuit private land. A quarry concession is valid for up to thirty years. If a user wishes to obtain gravelfrom an .existing quarry, a Quarry license must be obtained. The license allows the user to enter and operate on lnuvialuit lands, whilelimiting the type and amountof gravel that may be extracted. Royalty fees are charged per cubic metre of material removed from the pit. Any person has the right to obtain a quarry license for the removal of up to 38 cubic metres of gravel per year from lnuvialuit private land for personal use and not for resale.
4.2.3- Site Preparation

The preparation of a granular resource extraction site is generally carried out in the winter in the lnuvialuit SettlementRegion, in order to avoid disturbing the terrain surrounding the borrow source. The site may be reached by an all weather road, or a seasonal ice or tundra road. lnitiatly, snow is cleared from the excavation site and work areas, and moved to a location where it will not drift or melt into the borrow source (EBA Engineering Consultants, Ltd., 1987, Aklavik). Trees and topsoil must then be removed from the site, and soil should be

CHAPTER FOUR: DECONSTRUCTING THE AGGREGATE MANAGEMENT REGIMES lN THE iSR
4.2.5- Processing

To meet the specific needs of some projects, processing is necessary. Processing requires specific equipment to crush, sort, wash and stockpile the material. A gravel operation may make between 5 and 10 different products. Some gravel is used for fill, bedding, subbase or basecourse without processing; however most domestic sand and gravel are processed prior to use. In general, a front end toader dumps raw gravel from the pit into a hopper where the largest rocks are screened out. Conveyor belts carry a continuous stream of material through crushers which break up the stones, which are then screened by grain size and bigger chunks are reprocessed. The sand and gravel products are then loaded directly into trucks, {Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 1982). Neil Macleod, an engineer with EBA Engineering Consultants, Ltd. estimates that approximately eighty percent of granular resources used for infrastructure construction and maintenance in the Northwest Territories are obtained from natural gravel deposits and require minimal processing, and the remaining twenty percent is created by crushing rock that has been quarried.

4.2.6- Site Remediation

Restoration of the quarry site must be carried out whether the pit is being left temporarily or permanently. The quarry area must be cleared of waste or debris that was deposited at the site during quarry operation. As well, it must be ensured that drainage ditches are left open to atlow water to run away from the pit area. Quarries deeper than the water table may be left to flood naturally, as an acceptable form of restoration {Indian and Northern

66

CHAPTER FOUR: DECONSTRUCTING THE AGGREGATE MANAGEMENT REGIMES IN THE iSR
lnuvialuit land Administration Fee Schedule is $2.50/cubic yard {$3.29/cubic metre). This fee also includes fees for administration and reclamation. Royalty fees for granular resources from lnuvialuit private lands are distributed amongst the beneficiaries (tnuvia!uit people) of the Western Arctic Claim. In addition to the gravel royalty fee, there is a quarry license fee of $41.27, as well as a fee of $1,237 for each inspection of the quarry, which are carried out sporadically throughout the lifetime of the quarry. Furthermore, for the duration ofquarry activity on lnuvialuit private land, an environmental monitor must be present, at a cost of $2,063.28/day for the first thirty days, and $3,301.25 for each day after (Romaine, 2008, Personal Communication). The cost of a land Use Permit (Class B) whkh is required in order to operate a quarry on lnuvialuit private land is $2,475.94 plus $1,237.97 per hectare of land being used. Fees for reclamation that are charged by the Commissioner and the lnuivatuitland Administration are deposited into a land reclamation fund. When the quarry has been exhausted of gravel by various users, the money from the land reclamation fund is used torecontour,shape and dean the pit (Romaine, 2008, Personal Communication).

4.4~

Decision Making Process for Obtaining Granular Resources Economic feasibility is the primaryJactorthat influences the decision of a user about

where to obtain gravel from for a project. The decision making process for federal, territorial, lnuvialuit and private users can be seen in Appendix C, Diagram 2. There are two aspects of cost that are considered when obtaining gravel: the cost of buying the gravel from the land

Intuitively, a user would choose.t o acquire.gravelfromlhe.Jand owner with the4owest

fees. When taking aH cost aspects of operating a quarry and obtaining gravelinto .a ccount in

CHAPTER FIVE: ATIJTUOES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

5.1.- .Concerns About Granular ·Resource Management
The importance of granular resource management was made dear at the 2006 Northwest Territories Granular Users Forum, hosted bylndian and Northern Affairs Canada in Yellowknife. Todd Romaine (Chief land Administrator, lnuvialuit land Administration), Dan Elliott (Senior Granular Resource Officer, Indiana and Northern Affairs Canada), and Fred Collins (Projects and Geotechnical Officer, Public Works and Services, Government of the Northwest Territories) were asked during an expert panel discussion about the importance of granular resource .management in the Northwest Territories. Todd Romaine expressed that granular resources are the most undervalued and over utilized resources in the territory, and that an integrated management plan for all levels of government is crucial to the management of gravel. Dan Elliott stated that granular materials are a scarce resource in the Northwest Territoti·es and as such require management. He suggested that areas of improvement include the upkeep of demand forecasts, and ensuring that gravel is developed and extracted efficiently and in a sustainable manner. This indudesthe prevention of high grading (using material of better quality than is necessary for a project), through the developmentofpit management plans.for quarry sites. Finally, Fred CoUins emphasized that gravel must be managed sustainablytn order to meet the needs .offuture generations} and that the effective M arch 2007, pg. management of gravel has economic benefits to users (Terriplan Consuftants, :

respondents agreed thatmanagementof gravel is an issue of priority in the lSR. The specific
70

CHAPTER FIVE: ATIITUDESTOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

concerns of stakeholders are reviewed in the table in Appendix B. Some stakeholders are concerned that the priorities of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement are not being met in full, even twenty-four years after it was signed. It is also recognized that completing demand forecasts should be a priority for the ILA and tNAC, since one has not been completed in seven years. The fact that there are no conclusive pit management plans in place for most borrow sources raises concerns that gravel is not being used in the most sustainable way possible. Others worry about whether there will be enough gravel to meet competing demands, emphasizing that a management plan should be in place before private enterprises are granted rights to granular resources. Furthermore, there are concerns about monitoring and enforcement of the amount of gravel quarried and whether the limitations of quarry permits are complied to. From many stakeholder perspectives, it is very dear that the management ofgranular resources is an issue of priority within the Northwest Territories and the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. However, it appears that there are several steps that must be taken in order to develop a comprehensive granular resource management plan for the ISR and these will be discussed throughout the chapter.

5.2- Granular Resource Management Plans
A granular resource management plan is essential to the sustainable management of granular resources. The Department of Indian and Northern Development suggested in May, 1996, that a granular resource management plan should contain all the information necessary for resource managers to effectively manage granular resources (DIAND, May 1996, pg. 22).

71

CHAPTER FIVE: ATIITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

There are several elements that must be included in a management plan in order to achieve this goal: objectives and information about supply, demand and future development scenarios. It is essential that objectives be determined at the outset of developing a granular resource management plan in order to ensure that the plan contains the elements required to achieve these objectives. The objectives of the management plan should define the geographic area to which the management plan will apply, and the purpose of developing a granular resource management plan. In the case of the lnuvialuit Settlement Reigon, the geographic region would be the entire ISR, including 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(b) private lands, Crown lands and Commissioner's lands. The objectives would likely be to develop a joint management plan among the three land owners to ensure that the priorities of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement are achieved; making certain that the future demands of the six ISR communities can be met. In order to achieve the objectives of the granular resource management plan, one necessary element is an accurate supply inventory. This data will allow granular resource managers to determine whether there is enough supply to meet the demands of the quarry permit application (Department of Indian and Northern Affairs and Northern Development, May 1996). As well 7 it will aid in the location of the nearest (and likely most cost-efficient) source of gravel of the appropriate quality and quantity required by the user. Furthermore/ an accurate supply inventory can be used in conjunction with demand surveys in order to determine whether there will be enough gravel to meet the first priority of the lnuvialuit Final
Agreement (public and community needs) for the next twenty years before allocating gravel to

a second {lnuvialuit private needs) or third (private project approved by government) priority

72

CHAPTER FIVE: ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEM

user. Without accurate inventory of available granular resources, granular resource development cannot be met. An understanding of demand is also required for a granular resources plan. An account of historical demand is beneficial to forecasting demands. current demand forecasts are of necessity to make sure that the priorities of Agreement are met (OlAND, Mayl996). A granular resource management plan in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region would benefit from a consolidated report of gravel usage, drawing upon the four previous demand surveys that have been carried out since the inception of the IFA. This account would include information about the amount of gravel used during different activities within the region, for example, gravel usage during oil and gas exploration in the fate 1970s and early 1980s. The historical data could then be used by granular resource managers to predict how activity, such as petroleum development or population growth will likely impact resource demand in the future. Perhaps the most crucial element to a granular resource management plan is a demand forecast for the upcoming twenty years. The lnuvialuit Final Agreement requires that forecasts be carried out every five years, for the following twenty year period. In order to create a complete demand forecast, all users of gravel (inuvialuit, federal, territorial, municipal) within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region must be surveyed about their resource requirements for the upcoming five years (using a survey template such as that in Appendix D). A demand forecast that takes into account all potential uses of granular resources aHows resource managers to make informed decisions about whether second and third priority projects can be afforded gravel, or whether those demands will interfere with future community requirements. Without

73

CHAPTER FIVE: ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

a current demand forecast, it is impossible to determine whether resources are being allocated sustainably, because the future demand is unknown. Along with demand forecasts, development scenarios should also be included in a granular resource management plan. Development scenarios account for development that is speculative-although the project may not take place. If it does it has the potential to place increased demand on granular resources (OlAND, May 1996). In the case of the ISR, a portion of the granular resource management plan should be dedicated to the potential stress placed on granular resources by projects such as the Mackenzie Gas Project and the tnuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Road, as well as the potential for infrastructure related to population increase due to economic development within the region.

5.3- Current Granular Resource Management in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region The management of gravel is for the most part common across the three levels of jurisdiction that lie within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. Generally, gravel is managed through a permit process as is described at length in Chapter Four of this paper. The lnuvialuit land Administration, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and Municipal and Community Affairs issue permits for land use and the extraction of gravel on private, Crown and Commissioner's lands in the ISR. A permit application undergoes screening and consultation with organizations including Hunters and Trappers Committees and Environmental impact Screening Committees in order to determine whether the quarry operations will be environmentally feasible (Terri plan Consultants, March 2007, pg.7). If it is, the administrative body that owns the land on which the resources lie must determine whether there is the appropriate amount of resources to

74

CHAPTER FIVE: ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THEISR

meet the requirements of the user's application. lf these criteria are met, a quarry permit or license and a land use permit will be issued and the user will be allowed to extract gravel. Furthermore, the lnuvialuit land Administration has buHt monttoring and enforcement into the quarrying process, requiring (at the expense of the user) an environmental monitor to be present throughout the entire operation to ensure that the amount of gravel extracted does not exceed the permitted amount (Romaine, 2008, Personal Communication). Indian and Northern Affairs Canada also monitors the extraction of gravel; on a less frequent basis than the ILA using environmental inspectors to assess the quarry operation intermittently (Terri plan Consultants, March 2007). When monitors are not inspecting the excavations of users, the honour system is relied upon; and the user may not be estimating the amount of gravel removed accurately, potentially underestimating their hauls (Gowan, 2008, Personal Communication). Gravel extraction on Commissioner's land is monitored through the use of quarrying reports which are submitted to Municipal and Community Affairs, detailing the movement of gravel from the pit to the project site and the amount extracted on a daily basis. Although this management process m. ay meet the objectives of preventing environmental impacts and not exhausting the current supply of gravel, it does not take into consideration the overall objective of a granular resource management plan-to ensure the sustainable management of granular resources in the face of future demand.

5.4- Factors Hindering the Development of a Granular Resource Management Plan
The personal turnover in land management roles has been a significant factor in the slow development of a granular resource management plan for the lnuvialuit Settlement

75

CHAPTER FIVE: ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

Region. When the progress of the management plan was assessed in 2006 by Alpha Corporation, it was noted that personnel turnover in both the inuvialuit land Administration and the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs has caused delays in the development of a plan, because new personnel need to be informed about the objectives of the plan and updated on what has already been achieved and the remaining work to be completed. It is also difficult to propose ideas for a management plan without having the personnel to carry out the proposed ideas. For example, when developing pit management plans for borrow sources, including stipulations for monitoring of extracted resources and enforcement of reclamation plans/ these activities may be theoretically ideal, but may be impossible to implement in reality. Although the llA has requirements for monitoring and enforcement when quarry license are granted, the llA has few employees with this expertise. It is suggested that a reasonable solution to this problem would be to cost share OlAND granular resource technicians when their skills and expertise are required for lnuvialuit Private lands (Alpha Corporation, 2006}. Despite the method through which this may be achieved, it is dear that part of a granular resource management plan should focus on how the goals of the plan will be achieved including the hiring of personnel to help meet the goals of sustainable resource management, such as monitoring and enforcement during pit activity. Another factor that hinders the management of granular resources is the low participation rate in demand surveys. In the past, (for example, the 1991 forecast), the response rate of gravel users has been very low making the gravel demand survey incomplete and of little value as a tool for planning for demand because the overall demand from users is unknown. Susan Chaytor of Alpha Corporation suggests that participation rate in demand

76

CHAPTER FIVE: ATIITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

forecasting is always somewhat dismal in the north, likely due to a lack of personnel who can dedicate their time to completing the demand forecast for the upcoming 20 years. Furthermore, the best method of communication in the north seems to be in person or by phone, instead of email, fax or leaving messages. Therefore, the process can be more time consuming for the organization carrying out the survey as well. Ms. Chaytor suggested that it might be ideal to have a local organization collect data from the gravel users within their community, and have the consulting company consolidate the data once it has been obtained (Chaytor, 2008, Personal Communication).

5.5- Development ofa Granular Resource Management Plan
It is suggested that indian and Northern Affairs Canada is responsible for providing information, support and leadership to land claims and their management ofgranular resources, ultimately coordinating or jointly planning a management regime for gravel within a specific geographic region such as the lnuvialuit Settlement Region (OlAND, May 1996). This is demonstrated through a Memorandum of Understanding between INAC and the lnuvialuit Regional Corporation, to jointly develop a granular resource management plan with the objectives of conserving aggregates for their most appropriate use, focusing planning where there are resource shortages or significant future demands and adhering to requirements of the

lnuvialuit Final Agreement (Terriplan Consultants, March 2007). Thus, the first stage of
developing a granular resource management plan discussed in Section 5.2 has been completed. Because there are several land owners in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, the creation of a joint management plan will encourage the coordinated management of resources, while

77

CHAPTER FIVE: ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

avoiding duplication of efforts towards other essential elements of a management plan including supply inventories and demand surveys. Since proximity and cost are the primary factors influencing where users will take gravel from, a user that falls under one jurisdictional category will not necessarily take gravel from their corresponding land (ie/I GNWT Department of Transportation may take gravel from lnuvialuit private lands for the construction of the lnuvik Tuktoyaktuk highway). According to Phil Chidgzey of Alpha Corporation, the consulting company that assessed and reviewed the current granular resource management plan in the ISR, a joint management plan for granular resources will provide a "coordinated and systematic approach," encouraging the sharing of research and project data regarding supply and demand (Terriplan Consultants, March 2007). As such, joint management is not only a beneficial tool for land managers but essential to ensuring that the priorities of the /FA and the best interests of the lnuvialuit people are met. Al.pha Corporation's 2006 report on the status of the development of a granular resource management plan for the ISR outlined the progress that had been made as of 2006. Accomplishments included: the memorandum of understanding between the lnuvialuit Regional Corporation and the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs about joint management, consultation with the lnuvialuitland Administration, DIAND and other stakeholders, the development of a web based GIS prototype for the purpose of centralizing granular resources data, some community granularresource supply evaluations . (Aklavik, Paulatuk and Tuktoyaktuk), and further assessments of potential borrow sources near Aklavik and Tuktoyaktuk (Alpha Corporation, 2006).

78

CHAPTER FIVE: ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

In order to complete the management plan, an up-to-date supply inventory must be compiled, and it is suggested by Alpha Corporation that the inventory includes maps of the locations of pits, their access routes, other potential deposits and the amount of gravel within each source (Alpha Corporation, 2006). Furthermore, demand forecasts for all potential users of gravel within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region must be obtained. Demands for gravel by departments of the territorial and munjcipat governments are already provided in the Territorial Granular Resource Strategy (2007), leaving information outstanding from the federal government, lnuvialuit government and private users. Pit management plans with extraction, operating and remediation guidelines must also be developed for all sources of gravel within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region in order to ensure that gravel is being quarried in the most efficient and sustainable way possible (Alpha Corporation, 2006). Alpha corporation suggests that this could be done by streamlining existing management strategies of the federal government and the ILA. This would require a combination of the OlAND Pit and Quarry Management Guidelines (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 1982) and ILA requirements for environmental monitoringto develop and allencompassing set of pit management guidelines that could then be adapted to specific borrow sources using additional data about the characteristics and location of the borrow source. Finally, a working group of personnel from the lnuvialuit land Administration and indian and Northern Affairs Canada must be established to review and initiate these outstanding items of the granular resource management plan. Once the necessary components (supply inventory, demand forecasts, pit management plans) of the management plan are complete, a draft of the plan must be written . This draft must be published and then presented to ISR communities for
79

CHAPTER FIVE: ATTJTUDES TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT REGIME IN THE ISR

consultation. In doing so, any additional community concerns can be incorporated into the management plan, and community support for the management of the resources essential to their communities can be gained (Romaine in Terri plan Consultants, 2007).

5.6- Concerns about Granular Resource Management and Climate Change
Interviews with stakeholders indicated that there are concerns about granular resource availability and climate change. Most concerns led back to the idea that in order to adapt to climate change, management would have to be adapted as welL As can be seen in Appendix B, some participants were concerned about climate change causing a shorter hauling season. This would suggest that resource managers will require more knowledge of the accessibility and supply of borrow sources, and which sources will actually be feasible to obtain gravel from if the hauling season is shortened. Another concern raised was for Aklavik, which has only winter access to gravel. It was suggested that better forecasting needs to occur in orderto predict demand and have enough gravel stockpiled to last through the construction season (Semmler, 2008, Interview). As well, better pit management plans may be required to deal with the potential melting of massive ice within the ground due to climate change. Pit management plans could build in precautionary measures to avoid the exposure of ground ice to the atmosphere, ultimately ensuring that resources within the pit remain useable. Some stakeholders have also observed increases in demand for granular resources, perhaps due to warming temperatures, indicating that a managementplan should be developed as soon as possible to begin to prepare for further infrastructure vulnerabilities and granular resource demand.

80

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
6-1- Demand Forecasts

Granular resource forecasts are reports about the granular resource demands of various users over a specified period of time. They can contain gravel requirements for both public and private users for the following five years, with forecasts for an additional fifteen years. Generally there are three categories of demand for granular resources: community or public, government, and private or industriaL Community or public demands include demands for gravel for community operations, maintenance and for small scale residential development. Government demands for gravel are usually for infrastructure and projects funded by the Government of the Northwest Territories or the federal government. Finally, private or industrial demands are for gravel required by private companies including oil and gas developers, and local businesses such as contractors (Alpha Corporation, 2007). There are also three categories of use for granular resources: operation and maintenance, planned capital projects, and speculative capital projects. Operation and maintenance requirements for granular resources are for repairs and upgrades to existing infrastructure. Planned capital projects are those that will occur within the short term (5 years). Speculative capital projects are those that may or may not occur within the next twenty years, and are usually large scale, such as oil and gas development or the construction of a new highway (Ibid). A granular resource demand forecast includes information about what type of granular resources are required for these projects, and where the materials are proposed to be extracted from. Overall, a granular resource forecast serves as a tool for the sustainable short and long term management of granular resources, ultimately aiding managers to allocate resources based on supply and demand.

81

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND

6.2- Historical overview of demand forecasts for the lnuvialuit Settlement'Region
Since the lnuvialuit Final Agreement was implemented in 1984, four granular resource demand forecasts have been conducted for the ISR in 1987, 1991, 1995 and 2001 in an attempt to meet the requirements of Section 7(27) of the agreement. Thus, the forecasts have not been conducted at five year intervals as is required under Section 7(27), instead intermittently. These forecasts take into consideration both public demands from all levels of government as well as private demands. The Government of the Northwest Territories also conducts a granular resource forecast for any infrastructure they construct, operate and maintain.

In 1987, demand for granular resources in the six ISR communities was studied by EBA Engineering Consultants, using a questionnaire and foUow-up interview format with potential granular resource users. The forecasted demand for the twenty year period following 1987 was 17.4 million cubic metres. Ninety-two percent of the projected demand was for speculative projects (oil and gas development), five percent was for capital projects and three percent was for infrastructure maintenance requirements.

In 1991, Hardy BBT limited conducted another granular resources forecast. The forecast presented demand in five year blocks from 1987 to 2006. The 1991 forecast was built upon the 1987 forecast conducted by EBA, and updated demand information was requested of the granular resource users. However, only seven of the twenty-one identified potential users responded to the survey. The respondents were primarily from the oil and gas sector or the federal government (Alpha Corporation, March 2007, pg.9). Therefore, there was not enough response to create an accurate supply/demand model. Hardy BBT concluded that a more extensive granular resource demand survey was required for the region (Hardy BBT Ltd., July
82

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
1990). The demand projected for the 20 year period between 1987 and 2007 was re-forecasted to be 26 million cubic metres for Aklavik, lnuvik and Tuktoyaktuk alone, which is a large increase from the 1987 EBA forecast (Alpha Corporation, March 2007, pg. 9).

A third demand forecast was conducted in 1995 by North of 60 Engineering Ltd., for the period of 1995-2015. The 1995 forecast incorporated a record of how much gravel had actually been used between 1985 and 1994 based on ILA permits issued during that time period. It was found that only 2.5 percent of the granular resources for this period predicted in the 1987 forecast were used, and 5.5 percent of those predicted in the 1991 forecast were used (North of 60 Engineering Ltd, March 1995, pg. 48). It was noted that the speculative projects such as oil and gas development cause large discrepancies between the amount of gravel that is theoretically demanded and the amount of gravel that is actually used during a given period of time (Alpha Corporation, March 2007, pg. 10). The projected demand for the 20 year period of 1995-2015 was 4 million cubic metres (North of 60 Engineering, March 1995, pg. 10).

The most recent granular resource forecast was conducted in 2001 by North of 60 Engineering ltd, for the twenty year period of 2000 to 2020. North of 60 compared the forecasted demand for gravel between 1995 and 1999 to the actual demand for gravel, estimated through quarry licenses, and found that the actual demand was 50% higher than had been forecasted in the 1995 report. The forecasted demand for gravel for the 2000-2020 period was 5.37 million cubic metres, thirteen percent of which is demanded by communities, and the remainder by oil and gas exploration and development. The report stresses the fact that a demand database should be maintained and updated regarding the issuance of quarry

83

CHAPTER StX: DEMAND
licenses and the amount of materials extracted. This database will become important for monitoring rising demand due to oil and gas exploration and development, and will provide important information for the development of a gravel management plan for the region (McDougall, 2001).

6.3- Historical Demand for Granular Resources Jnformation about the actual demand for gravel in the lnuviatuit Settlement Region since the inception of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement in 1984 is difficult to obtain. Demand can be studied through the analysis of quarry licenses or permits that have been issued by governing bodies. However, data about quarry licenses is only publicly available for lnuvialuit private land, from the 1nuvialuit land Administration. In order to determine gravel demand on Crown land} Bob Gowan suggested that the information coutd be derived from data about the issuance of Land Use Permits for Crown land. Information about quarry permits is also unavailable for Commissioner's land.

Another issue that hinders the accuracy of analyzing demand is that it is likely that gravel is taken from borrow sources without a permit or license. It is not realistic or feasible to have personnel at each borrow source to monitor activity and enforce regulations, it has been suggested by a number of respondents that gravel is taken without the knowledge of administrative bodies. It is also possible that only prominent users (such as oil and gas companies, or government departments) bother to apply for quarry licenses or permits because their construction of infrastructure using gravel is likely to be noticed. If a large user constructs infrastructure, such as an access road, or a pipeline, it will have gone through other regulatory processes as well, such as environmental assessments. Thus the user could not easily obtain
84

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
gravel without the knowledge of the Crown or the lnuvialuit land Administration. However, if a small user (for example, an lnuvialuit-owned company) extracts gravel for the construction of a small outbuilding or gravel pad on their own property, it is more likely to go unnoticed bythe land administration, and may go unquestioned by the general public as it may be assumed that a quarry license has been obtained.

Taking the limitations of data regarding historical demands for gravel into consideration, the following is a discussion of the characteristics of demand for gravel in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region since 1984 rather than a numerical analysis of gravel usage. Available information about quarry activity can be viewed in Appendix D.

Overall, there are 104 records of quarry activity in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region between 1984 and 2007. Only six records of quarry activity were derived from information about Land Use Permits on Crown land, the remainder of activity occurred on lnuvialuit private land. The highest demand for granular material since 1984 occurred in 1985, when twenty permits were issued by the lnuvialuit land Administration, primarily for use for oil and gas exploration. Companies including ESSO, Dome Petroleum, Chevron and Shell obtained gravel during this time period for the construction of infrastructure for oil and gas exploration. The Department of National Defence has also been a primary user of gravel in the ISR, using gravel for infrastructure at Distant Early Warning (DEW) and SRR sites.

Thirty-four percent of all permits obtained were for use by public entities including the territorial or municipal governments. Thirty-eight percent of permits were for users within the private sector, while thirteen percent were obtained by the Department of National Defence.

85

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
The remaining forty-nine percent of permits were granted to unidentified users. The area from which gravel was most often taken was Tuktoyaktuk, making up forty-three percent of quarry permits. Fourteen percent of permits were issued for the lnuvik area, with the remaining permits were dispersed amongst the remaining communities or areas that are unidentified within the database.

Overall, there is not enough information to make conclusions about historical granular resource demand in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. However, there are several trends that emerge when examining quarry permits that have been issued since 1984 that should be taken into consideration when developing a granular resource management plan. It is dear that demand for gravel increases with oil and gas exploration activity. This trend will likely repeat itself if the Mackenzie Gas Project is approved by the federal government. As well, the majority of demand for gravel from private and Crown land has been from private users. Hence, it is important to obtain information from private users when creating the twenty year demand forecasts that are required by the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. Finally, most demand has occurred in the Tuktoyaktuk region, indicating that Tuktoyaktuk is a definite area of priority for the sustainable management of granular resources.

6.4- Current Demand Forecasts The most recent demand forecast for the lnuvialuit Settlement Region was seven years ago. In 2006, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada commissioned Alpha Corporation to review past granular resource forecasts and to present a methodology for completing a new forecast within the near future. Thus far, a template for obtaining and compiling granular resource demand information from all potential users has been developed (Appendix D). A list of
86

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
contacts for obtaining demand information has also been compiled. At present, the logistics of data collection are being organized, including determining the best method of achieving a high response rate from potential users (Chaytor, Personal Communication, 2008). As such, lacking is an up-to-date granular resources demand forecast for all users, public and private, within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region.

In the spring of 2007, the Government of the Northwest Territories released the
Territorial Granular Resources Strategy which includes forecasts for gravel demanded by

departments of the Territorial government, for aU communities within the Northwest Territories for three years, as well as long term speculation for public projects. The forecast was developed by an Interdepartmental Granular Acquisition Committee (IGAC) together with departments of Municipal and CommunityAffairs (MACA), Transportation (DOT}, Public Works and Services (PWS) and the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation (NWTHC) (Interdepartmental Granular Acquisition Committee, NWT, May 2007, pg. 2). The forecast includes details about the amount of gravel required for projects occurring between 2007 and 2010 and some information ·about where the gravel may come from and how collaboration between projects could occur in order to minimize pit development costs.

The ideal demand forecast for the lnuvialuit Settlement Region would incorporate the existing forecast from the Territorial Granular Resources Strategy in addition to demand forecasts for federal and private users (ie/I lnuvialuit companies, oil and gas developers}. If such a forecast were developed, the entire demand and its characteristics for the region could be planned for during the creation of a granular resources management plan.

87

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
6.5- Current Demand for Gravel in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region
Gravel demand by GNWT departments and MACA is directly correlated with community size and population. The forecasted demand for gravel by the Government of the Northwest Territories and Municipal and Community Affairs for each community is outUned in Table 6.1 below.

Table 6.1- Forecasted Demand for Territorial and Municipal Users in lnuvialuit Settlement Region Communities Source: Derived from the Territorial Granular Resource Forecast (Interdepartmental Granular Acquisition Committee, 2007}

Sachs Harbour, the ISR community with the smallest population has the lowest demand for gravel (20,175 m
3 ),

while lnuvik1 the most populous community has the highest demand

(180,000 m 3 ) between 2007 and 2010. lnuvik, Sachs Harbour and Tuktoyaktuk are forecasted
to have decreasing demands for gravel between 2007 and 2010. Meanwhile, Paulatuk, Ulukhaktok and Aklavik are forecasted to have unsteady demand overthe same three year period.

88

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
The most demanding use of gravel for each community is for operation and maintenance of infrastructure and for road resurfacing. Aklavik requires gravel for road

erosion protection on a yearly basis, as well as gravel for its water treatment plant, an extension of the airstrip and for housing development. lnuvik will require gravel for housing development each year between 2007 and 2010, as well as for airport maintenance and the construction of a gym for Aurora College. The community of Paulatuk requires gravel for various capital plan projects which are unnamed in the forecast, as wen as housing, and for a fuel storage site upgrade. Sachs Harbour requires gravel for the construction of an RCMP building, the water treatment plant, housing and for maintenance of the fuel tank farm . Tuktoyaktuk will also require gravel for its water treatment plant, as well as for unnamed capital plan projects and housing. Finally, Ulukhaktok has demand for gravel for its water treatment plant, capital projects and housing. Current demand for granular resources from users other than the Government of the Northwest Territories is undocumented at this time.

6.6- Competing Demands for Granular Resources A 2007 report prepared for the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development identifies natural gas development as the most significant demand for granular resources in the Mackenzie Delta region. It is predicted that natural gas development may result in conflicts in demand between private industrial and community needs (Alpha Corporation, March 2007, pg. 6). There are two projects in particular that may place competing demands on granular resources within the ISR. The first is the already approved Mackenzie Gas Project and the potentiallnuvik Tuktoyaktuk Highway. Both projects offer tremendous potential to contribute

89

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
to economic .growth for the region, however, they place intense demands on granular resources which are already scarce within the region.

6.6.1- Mackenzie Gas Project

The proposed Mackenzie Gas Project, if approved will add additional pressure on granular resources in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. The timeHne for the project according to Roy Wilson, the lnuvialuit Settlement Regional Liaison for Imperial Oil, is to have a certificate of public convenience in fall of 2008, permitting the construction of the pipeline. If this certificate is obtained, construction is intended to begin in 2010, lasting three years. The project will require the construction of infrastructure to support the production and transportation of natural gas from the Mackenzie Delta to Alberta. The major infrastructure required for the project in dudes three natural gas field production facilities which lie within the ISR '(at Niglintgak (developed by Shell Canada), Taglu (Imperial Oil) and Parsons lake (Conoco Phillips and Exxon Mobil)), a gathering pipeline system, a gas processing facility near lnuvik, and a natural gas liquids pipeline from the lnuvik area facility to Norman Wells, NWT.

Before construction for the project begins, the creation of some new infrastructure will be required. The Mackenzie Gas Project estimates that approximately 20 kilometres of new allweather roads will be required in order to provide access to the lnuvik-area processing facility and to the Norman Wells compressor station, as well as between barge landingsites, borrow source material sites, and camps and stockpile sites. Furthermore, a 20 kilometre road is also being considered for the Trail River area compressor station (MGP, January2004, pg. 1).

90

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
Barge landing sites will be required for equipment and materials that will arrive by barge and these sites will require access ramps and roads for the transportation equipment. Airstrips and helipads may be required at each of the main construction camps for the movement of supply and emergency purposes, and these pads will require granular resources.

The total amount of borrow material required for the Mackenzie Gas Project from Crown lands within the ISR is approximately 300,000 cubic metres for the gathering pipeline, and 1.6 million cubic metres for the Parsons lake and Taglu anchor fields {Imperial Oil Resources Ventures limited, 2006). Another 800,000 cubic metres of gravel will be required for the Niglintgak anchor field, and this gravel will be taken from lnuvialuit private lands. Other pipeline related infrastructure will require another 550,000 cubic metres of granular resources from private land. The total extracted amount of gravel required from the ISR for the Mackenzie Gas Project is over 3 million cubic metres. The demands and sources for gravel for the MGP within the ISR are summarized in Table 6.2.

Table 6.2- Primary Borrow Sites for the Mackenzie Gas Project in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region Source: Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited, 2007

It is expected that in locations with stable terrain, pit development and gravel extraction can take place in the summer. Therefore, Taglu and Parsons lake will have construction year round. However if the terrain is thermafly sensitive, work wH occur during the winter. Since the Niglintgak anchor field will be barge based, it will be largely constructed off site, and assembled after components are barged to the site (Wilson, 2007, Interview). Most gravel for infrastructure construction will be quarried during the witner, with the exception of around Parsons lake, which has a gravel source nearby which will have a year round access road (Ibid). The development rate of the borrow sites will depend on the amount of ice content within the borrow sources. If there is high ice content in a source, the gravel may be excavated and stockpiled a year in advance and left to melt and drain over the summer for use in the following winter (Mackenzie Gas Project, March 2006, Online).

92

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
According to Roy Wilson of Imperial Oil, if the communities {lnuvik and Tuktoyaktuk specifically} decide that they require gravel from the sources that the Mackenzie Gas Project has chosen as its primary borrow sources, the MGP will have to utilize secondary sources which have been prospected by the developers. These sources are less ideal than the primary sources, for reasons that are undisclosed, and their characteristics such as quantity and quality of the gravel are also undisclosed by the Mackenzie Gas Project.

The Mackenzie Gas Project has reclamation plans in place for the quarries that will be utilized to construct the pipeline and related infrastructure, and will restore the quarries to the standards of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. When the gas extraction portion of the project is complete, all related infrastructure must be removed, unless a community can utilize it (for example, a barge landing site may be of use to a community). However, the pipeline will remain since natural reclamation will have begun over the approximate twenty year lifetime of the project and hence it would be more destructive to rip it back up. Gravel used for the project other than beneath the pipeline will be cleaned up and made available to communities. It is estimated that fifty percent of the gravel used for the project will be usable by communities again in thirty years. Because of this, some of the gravel used for the project could be considered "borrowed" or Ill eased" since it will become available for use again at a later date (Wilson, 2007, Interview).

The Mackenzie Gas Project will submit permit applications for granular resources in 2009, should the project be approved. As such, it would be beneficial for the lnuvialuit Settlement Region to have a full demand forecast complete so that community needs are

93

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
known before granular resources are made available for the MGP. This would be in keeping with the lnuvialuit Final Agreement priorities, ensuring that public needs are met (first priority) before private needs are considered (third priority).

6.6.2- lnuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Road

In 1994, the Northwest Territories Transportation Strategy identified a road corridor between rnuvik and Tuktoyaktuk as infrastructure that would be necessary for resource and economic development in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. Currently, the only access to Tuktoyaktuk is by seasonal ice road along the Mackenzie River from lnuvik, which operates for three to four months each year, and by air (GNWT DOT, 1999a, pg ii). The prospect of an all weather road has been discussed since the late 1960s, and the first route plan was developed in 1974 when oH and gas exploration was occurring at Parsons lake, south of Tuktoyaktuk (Ibid, pg 2-1). Oil and gas development did not advance in the 1970s, and interest in the development of the road rose and feU throughout the 1980s with economic and political changes. However, in 1997 the tnuvikTuktoyaktuk Highway Steering Committee was formed, and in 1998the Department of Transportation established a Stakeholder Committee, which confirmed that a 140 kilometre route origninally proposed by Public Works Canada in 1977 would be the ideal route for the lnuvik Tuktoyaktuk Highway (Ibid, pg. 2-2). The proposed route can be observed in Figure 6.1, along with the existing ice road.

95

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
During community consultations which took place in January of 1999, one of the concerns expressed by both community individuals and elders with traditional knowledge was the issue of where gravel would be obtained from for the project, and how much in royalties would be paid to the lnuvialuit and by whom for the use of granular resources. The importance of careful planning of where aggregates would come from for the road and associated infrastructure was also emphasized during community consultations in Yellowknife (GNWT DOT, 1999a, pg vi).

The executive report for the lnuvik Tuktoyaktuk Highway, published in 1999 recognized that there is a lack of borrow sources with good potential within dose proximity to the proposed highway route. The report raises concerns about the poor quality of the granular resources in the area, and their distance from the proposed route, as well as the massive ice deposits within the borrow sources and the presence of silt within the deposits (GNWT DOT,

1999a, 3-36).

There have been two design plans proposed for the highway-one designed for travel speeds of 80 kilometres per hour, and one designed for speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour. Both roads would consist of a roadtop of 8.4 metres wide, with a minimum of 1.2 metres of fill underneath. The 80 km/h option would require more general fill and crushed gravel than the 60 km/h option (GNWT DOT, 1999a, pg. 2-5). The estimated granular resource requirement for the lnuvik Tuktoyaktuk highway is 3,300,000 cubic metres, and the requirements for the highway were estimated using the dimensions in the cross-section presented in Figure 6.2:

Climate Change and Demand

If there is an increase in atmospheric temperature by 6.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 (as discussed in Chapter 2, Section 4), the thaw depth of the active layer could increase by up to 70 centimetres. Therefore, an additional 70 centimetres of gravel would be required underneath

97

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
newly constructed infrastructure in addition to the current amount of gravel used in order to create a thick enough non-frost susceptible layer.

tndian and Northern Affairs Canada has commissioned North of 60 Engineering ltd. to create a granular resource estimating tool which is available online (http://www.grancaic.ca). This tool can be implemented to project the additional demand that climate change may place on granular resources for the construction of infrastructure. In order to estimate the amount of gravel required for a project, measurements of a gravel pad or layer can be input into the estimating tool. In order to demonstrate the additional demands that will be placed on granular resources due to climate change, the case of the potentiallnuvik Tuktoyaktuk Highway was selected. Engineering reports detailing the dimensions of the highway have been published by the GNWT Department of Transportation (March 1999) and these dimensions were entered into the estimating tool. For the scenario of a 60 kilometre/hour, 140 kilometre long highway from lnuvik to Tuktoyaktuk, with a roadtop width of 8.4 metres, and an embankment fill (road depth) of 1.2 metres plus surface fill of 10 centimetres, the amount of granular resources required is calculated by the estimating tool to be 2,559,480 cubic metres. If the embankment fill is increased by 70 centimetres in order to prevent road settlement and heaving due to climate change, the amount of gravel required for the project increases to 4,532,220 cubic metres.

In addition to increased amounts of gravel required for the construction of new infrastructure, granular resources will also be required to diminish the impacts of climate change on existing infrastructure, and to repair or replace that which is damaged or destroyed

CHAPTER SIX: DEMAND
because of changes in the permafrost due to increased temperatures. Specific estimates of how much gravel will be required to protect infrastructure from failure are unavailable from literature" However, Neil Macleod of EBA Engineering indicated that the requirement for gravel is a function of the soil and ground ice conditions in the area that is impacted by climate change, as well as the tolerance of infrastructure to permafrost degradation (Macleod, 2008, Interview)" There are no studies that suggest how much extra granular material will be required to minimize the impacts of climate change on infrastructure in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, however, it is suggested that the amount of gravel used for the construction of new projects has already increased by fifteen to twenty percent to prevent infrastructure failure due to future climate change (Ibid).

7.1- Supply Inventories

The location and characteristics of available granular resources in a geographic region can be accounted for in a supply inventory. A gravel supply .inventory indudes information about the location, setting, owner, continuity, amount, and type of gravel, as well as constraints to developing the borrow source and the accessibility of the source.
7.1.1- Granular Material Quality

Within the inventory, gravel is classified into one of five standard categories of granular resource quality, which were developed by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada in 1983:

Class 1- Excellent quality sands and gravels suitable for use as high quality surfacing materials, or as high quality asphalt or concrete aggregate, requiring minimat processing

Class 2- Good quality well-graded sands and gravels with limited silt, suitable as a good quality base or structure-supporting fill

Class 3- Fair quality material, of poorly-graded sands and gravel, used for fair quality general fill for roads, foundation pads, or yards

Class 4- Poor quality, silty, poorly-graded sand with little gravel content, may be used as general filt, not supporting structures

100

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

Class 5- Bedrock of fair to good quality, potentially excellent construction material for general fill or concrete aggregate, if quarried and processed

(EBA Engineering Consultants, ltd. (a), 1987)

The estimated amount of gravel in each source is categorized into certainty Jevels: proven, probable and prospective. The amount ofproven gravel within a source is a volume that has been estimated based on ground truthing methods, indudingboreholes and test pitting which has been carried out extensively at the site. The probable amount of gravel is that which has been estimated based on less concrete evidence, such as airphoto interpretation, topography, landform characteristics/ and limited ground sampling. Prospective volume refers to the amount of gravel that has been estimated to be in a source based on limited evidence, and without any ground truthing (EBA Engineering Consultants, Ltd. (a), Ltd., 1987). Using these categories, the amount of gravel that is potentially available to communities is identified, and the sources that require more exploration are noted.

7.1.2- Access to Gravel
A gravel inventory also indicates how the gravel can be accessed seasonally. Gravel is acquired by several different routes and methods of transportation in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, including all-season roads, tundra roads, ice roads, and barges on rivers, lakes or the ocean. Dedicated access roads to sources of gravel are expensive to build and difficult to maintain due to heavy loads of the hauling equipment, and therefore tundra and ice roads provide viable alternatives (Nuna Logistics, 2003, Online). Ice roads are those constructed
101

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

across frozen rivers or lakes. Auger trucks are used to drill holes through the ice, causing flooding to occur, and the water freezes adding thickness to the ice. Generally, the thickness of an ice road begins at approximately half a metre and peaks at two metres during the winter (Coneco Equipment, 2004, Online). Tundra roads are built across the land; once there is a significant amount of snow overlying the tundra, the snow is compacted creating a roadway. If gravel is located next to a waterway, extracting equipment can be delivered to the site and gravel can be hauled back to a community by barge. The use of a barge for transportation of equipment and gravel usually requires the construction of a dock for the barge, and access roads from the dock to the gravel source (EBA Engineering Consultants, ltd. {e), Ltd., 1987). Both of these require granular resources for their construction, and hence, if the pit has only a small amount of gravel to begin with, it is not worthwhile to use the resources to construct infrastructure for barge accessibility.

7.1.3- Constraints to Pit Development

Figure 7.1 depicts a hypothetical granular deposit within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, and the characteristics of a typical deposit. There are many factors that can make difficult or prevent the development of a gravel pit. These constraining factors may be physical in nature, such as the existence of massive ground ice within the source, a large amount of overburden over the gravelrequiring extra labour to remove compared to other sources with little overburden, or location within a lake, river or ocean environment, making it difficult to carry out extraction, stockpiling and hauling processes. Some sources of gravel may be directly adjacent to a river or lake, and it is recommended that pit development be restricted to at least

102

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

thirty metres away from such water bodies to prevent disturbance of the ecosystem as well as to avoid flooding of the pit. As weU, some granular resources lie in riverbeds, which can be extracted through dredging. However, this activity is only permitted after clearance from the Department ofFisheries and Oceans and through the Northern Inland Waters Act~ if the activity will have no negative impacts on fish within the river (INAC, 1982, pg. 13). Most physical constraints can be worked around during pit development, but add cost to and decrease efficiency of the operation.

Figure 7.1- Characteristics of a Generic Granular Resource Deposit in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region Source: Thompson, March 1994 Other constraints to development are related to the environment. Such factors include the land's significance as a fish or wildlife habitat or breeding ground, the presence of an at-risk species, or the location of a bird sanctuary. The 1994 Migratory Birds Convention Act and

103

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

Regulations and the Migratory Birds Sanctuary Regulations prohibit activity that may harm

birds and their habitats and breeding grounds (INAC, 4 July 2001, Online). Likewise, the Wildlife
Act (NWT) states that no person shall"engage in any activity that is likely to result in a

significant disturbance to a substantial number of wildlife animals" without a permit (INAC (d), 21 February 2005, Online). Environmental constraints such as these prevent gravel sources from being developed, because of the significance of wildlife to traditional Inuit harvesting activities as well as species preservation efforts by the territorial and federal governments.

7.2- Historical Supply Inventories in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region

It has been noted that the availability of information about granular resource supply is a m unication, 2008). In 1987, EBA function of demand for the resources (Gowan, Personal Com. Engineering Consultants, ltd. concluded that communities adjacent to oit and gas exploration (lnuvik and Tuktoyaktuk) may have greater demand for graveJ, and therefore, potential borrow sources have been thoroughly investigated in those areas. However, Ulukhaktok, Sachs Harbour and Paulatuk, which are generally unassociated with oil and gas exploration and development have far less information about the location and characteristics of nearby borrow sources. Historically, in communities where gravel is in less demand, information about the gravel supply is limited to the near vicinity of the community. Contrarily, in communities where gravel is required beyond normal community consumption, information is available about gravel further afield, because private companies have carried out reconnaissance and exploration.

104

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPlY

In 1987, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada on behatf of the lnuvialuitland Administration commissioned EBA Engineering Consultants, ltd. to conduct supply inventories and a twenty year demand forecasts for the six ISH communities. The inventories were based upon all available information-site investigations, ·airphotos, and ground truthing in some cases. The 1987 report is the only time the granular resource potential for aU communities has been inventoried since the implementation of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement. The information about granular resources obtained from these inventories serves as the basis of the existing tnuvialuit Settlement Region supply inventory. Further reports have been compiled about the supply of granular resources in the ISH since the 1987 EBA reports. One report was presented to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) in 1991 by Hardy BBT limited about granular resource potential in the Mackenzie Delta (Tuktoyaktuk, Jnuvik and Aklavik) only, drawing upon information from the 1987 EBA reports as well as more recent information from investigations for the gas pipeline and a potential Mackenzie Highway, and from reports from the Geological Survey of Canada. ln the same year another study was commissioned by INAC and conducted by EBA Engineering Consultants Ltd., re-evaluating the granular resource potential around Paulatuk. In this report, assessments of gravel at sources 87-P-12 and 87-P-23 were carried out because the former had just been opened for development by the GNWT Department of Transportation and the latter was being used as a primary source of gravel and was becoming depleted. finally, in 1993, french Arctic

Consultants Limited completed two reports in which the granular resources surrounding U!ukhaktok and Sachs Harbour were mapped.

7.3- Current Supply Inventory 7.3.1- Development of the Supply Inventory The current supply inventory that is used by land managers for lnuvialuit private lands and federal lands is based on the 1987 supply inventories completed by EBA Engineering Consultants (Harlow, 2008, Interview). When a quarry license or concession is issued by the rightful land owner of the granular resources, the amount of gravel allotted to the user by the permit is deducted from the supply inventory. The amount of material leaving pits on private land is monitored by an environmental monitor who is hired at the expense of the user to ensure that no more than the appropriate amount of gravel allotted by the permit is extracted (Romaine, 2007, Interview). During conversation about the supply inventory for the lnuvialuit land Administration, Todd Romaine, Chief land Administrator suggested that the inventory is likely inaccurate. This is due to the fact that gravel is probably being extracted by some users from pits without the acquisition of a quarry license beforehand. As such, it is impossible to track how much gravel is being removed from each source over time. This scenario is suggested because between 2000 and 2007 there have only been licenses issued for nine projects, when in alllikelihood, there have been more than nine projects requiring granular resources from lnuvialuit private lands. The nine licenses issued were for users such as Petro Canada, E. Grubens Transport (a major lnuvialuit-owned company) and the Hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk. It may be the case that smaller users may not bother to apply for quarry licenses as the quarries are not monitored. Therefore, the recoverable volumes of granular material indicated in the supply inventory are likely lower

106

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

than what the inventory suggests and as such available gravel supply may be overestimated for communities.

7.3.2- Present Constraints to Community Gravel Supplies

7.3.2.1- Ground Ice
The existence of massive ice within a gravel deposit often makes it undesirable to develop, because it must be either avoided and preserved or allowed to thaw out. When ground ke is exposed to the atmosphere due to excavation, it will melt, and the water resulti.ng from the melting will make the surrounding ground muddy and sticky. This in turn makes the gravel difficult to separate from silt and soil, making it necessary to dry the wet granular material before it can be used (Wainman/ 2007, Interview). There are two methods of coping with ice in a borrow source-removal of surrounding gravel or preservation ofthe ice. Kurt Wainman, president of Northwind Industries in tnuvik suggests that removing gravel around the ground ice slows down the construction process, requiring extra time and labour. If ground ice exists within a source, a layer of gravel surrounding the ice can be removed, and the newly exposed ice is able to thaw out. The procedure of removal and thawing continues as the pit is dug deeper. However, each time the ground ice is exposed it can take up to five years to melt. Despite the tedium of allowing ground ice to thaw out, this method ensures that the maximum amount of gravel is extracted from the source in areas where gravel is in short supply (Wainman, 2007, Interview). Another method of coping with ground ice in a borrow source is to preserve it so that it is not able to thaw~ ultimately preventing water from entering the surrounding granular

107

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

material. In order to do so, it is suggested that a minimum of 150 centimetres of gravel is left surrounding the ground ice, in order to insulate it and prevent it from thawing (EBA Engineering Consultants, ltd. (e); April1987}. Although this method preserves the quality of the gravel within the source, it constrains the maximum amount of gravel that can be removed from the source when supplies may be very limited for a community. The presence of ground ice has been identified as a significant constraint to sustainable pit management. Mardy Semmler, Land Manager for the Gwich'in Tribal council indicates that without personnel to monitor the pits as users extract gravel, if the user comes across ground ice it will be avoided, and a new area will be excavated where gravel is easier to extract (Semmler, 2008, Interview). This creates a larger footprint than originally anticipated when the quarry license was issued (Wainman, 2007, Interview). likewise, when ice is uncovered by a user while quarrying, often it is not covered back up, allowing it to melt during the summer, making the gravel undesirable to the next pit user (Semmler, 2008, Interview).

7.3.2.2- Granular Material Quality The construction and maintenance of infrastructure requires gravel of reasonable quality. However, the distribution ofquality granular resources in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region is uneven, leaving some communities with access to resources suitable for infrastructure construction and maintenance while others have access to only poor quality material. Because of this, although gravel may exist within dose proximity to a community, developers may need to travel further afield to obtain gravel of an appropriate grade, ultimately increasing the costs of acquiring gravel as a user.

108

CHAPTERSEVEN: SUPPLY
It is estimated that approximately seventy-five percent ofgranular resource requirements within the Northwest Territories are for general fm, of low quality (Class 4). Approximately fifteen percent ofgranular resource demand is for fair quality gravel (Class 3), five percent is for good quality material (Class 2), and five percent of demand is for high quality material (Class 1) (Macleod, 2008, Interview). Neil Macleod, of EBA Engineering Consultants, ltd. proposes that a user wm select a borrow source to extract from based on quality and distance, choosing the closest source of the most suitable material fort he project.

7.3.2.3- Accessibility

The accessibility of granular resources varies by location and proximity to a community. EBA Engineering Consultants, ltd. (1987 (a)} suggest that access to granular resources is influenced by two factors: cost and environmental protection. Those pits that are nearer to communities and have large volumes of recoverable material are moreJikelyto be worthy of construction of an all season road for access. Because the construction of aU-season roads is not economically feasible for gravel pits that lie outside community limits, most gravel is accessed by routes that are impacted by seasonality. The creation and operating season of tundra and ice roads is influenced by atmospheric temperature. likewise, the season during which gravel can be accessed by barge is also dependent on temperature, and when waterways are free of ice. Therefore, atmospheric temperature dictates when most gravel can be accessed in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. Before a project, such as the construction of any road is carried out in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, it must be reviewed by the Environmental Impact Screening Committee

109

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPlY
(EISC). The project is reviewed for potential environmental impacts, such as conflict with wildlife management plans or community conservation plans, or causing habitat loss and disturbance to significant species including those that are traditionally harvested by the lnuvialuit or are keystone species. The project must also fall within territorial or federal air and water quality standards (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2001). Therefore, the construction of roads for access to granular resources is only possible if it does not interfere with wildlife or have significant negative impacts on the environment. As such, although a source of gravel may exist within dose proximity of a community, access may be restricted due to environmental impact. Having only seasonal access to aggregates creates vulnerabilities for lnuvialuit communities. A lack of year-round gravel supply is a major concern for Aklavik. According to Mardy Semmler, land Manager of the Gwich'in Tribal Council, Aklavik flooded in 2006, washing out roads and gravel pads such that gravel was required to repair and rebuild some infrastructure. However, at the time the community had no stockpile, and there were no nearby sources that were accessible during the spring. As a result, the community resorted to hauling gravel on barges from the lnuvik area in order to rebuild infrastructure (Semmler, 2008, Interview).

7.3.3- Current Community Gravel Supplies

Compared to other areas in Canada, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut rely heavily on granular resources that are very difficult to access. The neigbouring Yukon Territory has excess gravel which is often exported to Alaska. However, granular resource borrow sites

110

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

surrounding the inuvialuit Settlement Region communities are nearly exhausted, and there are economic constraints to developing sources further afield (Romaine, 2007, Interview).

Aklavik Aklavik has no sources ofgravel within fifteen kilometers of the community. The nearest borrow sources are located on Crown land and are between 15 and 20 kilometres away. Both sources (468 and 469) are accessible only during the winter, and both contain gravel of extremely poor quality (Class 5.). The nearest gravel of fair quality (Class 3) is located between 20.1 and 30 kilometres of Aldavik, at two different locations (Pits 455 and 467) on Crown land. Both of these sources can be developed without constraints, and together have a recoverable volume of 3.5 million cubic metres. Two of the pits on Crown land within 30 kilometres of Aklavik, that were accessible year round by winter road and barge have been completely depleted of granular material. Two more sources of extremely poor quality material lie over fifty kHometers from the community, and despite having 8 million cubic metres of material, are constrained by wildlife habitat protection and lack of accessibility. Overall, Aklavik has very poor access to granular resources, and this access is limtted to the winter season. :Even then, the materials are of a quality useful for general fill at best, and not for supporting infrastructure such as housing or for finishing roads.

There are only three sources of gravel within ten kilometers of lnuvik, and one of them is nearly exhausted of material (1400). The pit (1402) with the greatest amount of gravel within
111

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

close proximity of the community belongs to Transport Canada, and as such is reserved for projects that are supported by Transport Canada. The remaining pit (1401A) lies on Crown land and does contain over one million cubic metres of recoverable gravel. However, this source lies in an area of significance for wildlife, and is only of fair quality and accessible only during the winter. Pit 1400, which is almost exhausted was the nearest source of gravel on private land and accessible year round. There are three sources of gravel between 15.1 and 20 kilometres of the community/ and two (1403 and 1404) are accessible year round by permanent access roads and have no constraints to development. The total recoverable volume between these two pits is 2.5 million cubic metres, however the gravel is of poor quality. One of the sources (2.46) located within 15.1 and 20 kilometres of lnuvik has been completely depleted. Another (R29) is accessible year round by winter road and barge, and contains 20 million cubic metres of granular material, but it is also of poor quality. The largest source (2.43) of granular material for lnuvik lies between 30.1 and 40 kilometres of the community and contains 180 million cubic metres of gravel, of Class 4 quality. It is accessible only during the winter by tundra or ice roads and has no constraints to development. The nearest sources of good quality (Class 2) gravel lie between 60.1 and 90 kilometres of the community and all are constrained by environmental factors. Two are located in areas identified as significant by the International Biological Program, another is located in a fish and wildlife habitat, while the finaJ one has development constraints due to the presence of massive ice. The closest source of good quality developable granular material is at the Ya Ya lakes site, approximately 100 kilometres from lnuvik. This site contains nearly 13 million cubic

112

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

metres of recoverable Class 2 material, but is only accessible during the winter by tundra or ice roads. In general, over fifty percent of the 34 potential borrow sources for lnuvik have constraints to development as they are in areas of environmental significance or wildlife habitats. Another fifteen percent of the borrow sources have physical constraints to development. Although there is approximately 448 million cubic metres of granular potential for extraction, only half of it is available for development without environmental or physical constraints.

Paulatuk There are four sources (87-P-11, 87-P-12, 87-P-21, 87-P-22) of granular material within

10 kilometres of Paulatuk. All of the sources are on private land and are accessible by winter
road only. These four sources have a total recoverable volume of 3,950,000 cubic metres of graveL However, each source has constraints to development Both 87-P-12 and
87~P..:21

have

poor accessibility, while 87-P-11 and 87-P-22 are wet because they are low lying or on the coast. The highest quality of gravel within 10 kilometres of the community is located at source

87-P-12, and is Class 2 (good quaUty)with a volume ofone million cubic metres. Meanwhile,
source 87-P-11 and 87-'P-21 contain Class 3 (fair quality) materials and 87-P-22 has Class 4 (poor quality) gravel. Between 10.1 and 15 kilometres ofPaulatuk there are four sources (87-P-9, 87-P-10, 87-

P-13 and 87-P-20) that contain a total of 8.9 mitlion cubic metres of gravel. 87-P-9 lies on
Crown land, while the other three pits lie on private land, and aU are accessible during the

113

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

winter only by tundra or ice road. Pit 87-P-20 is the closest borrow source to the community with no constraints to development, and contains Class 3 granular material. The pit, despite a large recoverable volume (5 million cubic metres) has Class 4 granular material and its development is constrained by poor accessibility. Source 87-P-10 is also poorly accessible and 87-P-13 is relatively thin. There are eight borrow sources between 15.1 and 20 kilometres of the community, with a combined recoverable volume of 16.5 million cubic metres. Three of these pits have no constraints to development (87-P-1, 87-P-14, 87-P-19). 87-P-19 contains Class 2 material, and 87-P-15 and 87-P-19 have Class 3 material. The remaining pits within 15.1 and 20 kilometres of Paulatuk are constrained by poor accessibility, poor material quality, presence of ground ice, or by being thinly distributed. Three sources (88-P-3, 87-P-16 and 87-P-17) lie at distances greater than 20 kilometres from Paulatuk. Source 88-P-3, containing Class 2 material could be developed without constraints, however, is not continuously distributed and is only accessible during the winter. Pit 87-P-17 has been depleted and contains no resources, and pit 87-P-16 is thinly dispersed and contains ground ice. Overalf, there are no sources of granular material within ten kilometers of Paulatuk that have no constraints to development. The nearest source that is unconstrained is approximately 15 kilometres from the community, and contains Class 3 (fair quality) materials. There are two other sources without constraints between 15.1 and 20 kilometres from the community, containing Class 2 and 3 materials, and one source more than 20 kilometres away with Class 2

114

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY
materials. Paulatuk has no summer access to granular materials, and all but one identified sources of gravel He on lnuvialuit private land.

Sachs Harbour There is a total ofover 13.6 million cubic metres of recoverable granular material within 20 kilometres of Sachs Harbour,and aU of this material has been identified as Class 3 (fair quality) material. All sources of gravel that have been identified in the supply inventory lie on lnuvialuit private land. Within 10.kilometres of the community, there are ten borrow sources. Six of these sources are accessible year round, four by all-season roads, two by ice road in the winter and barge in the summer. Four of the sources are accessible in the winter only bytundra road. Of the ten sources, only two (87-SH-1 and 87-SH-2) have no constraints to development. Three of the sources (87-SH-3, 87-SH-5 and 87-SH-6) have small volumes, while 87-SH-4 is depleted. Four of the sources are difficult to develop and extract from due to their proximity to water bodies. There are over7 million cubic metres of Class 3 granular material within 10kilometres of Sachs Harbour, only 200,000 cubic metres of which have no constraints to development. further from the community, between 10.1 and 15 kilometres, there are two more sources of gravel on private lands (87-SH-7 and 87-SH-11). 87-SH-7 is accessible year round, but its development is constrained byJts coastal location. Source 87-SH-11 is the largest source of gravel in the Sachs Harbour area (6.5 million cubic metres), however is only accessible during the winter, and is constrained by its location within a riverine environment.

115

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

There is one source of gravel 19 kilometres away from the community that is accessible year-round by tundra road in the winter and barge in the summer. However, constraints to its development have not been identified, and as such it may not be a viable source of gravel for Sachs Harbour. Overall, the sources of gravel accessible year round to Sachs Harbour are largely depleted. As such, the community may have to develop borrow sources that are only accessible during the winter. The development of most of these sources may be difficult as they are located in river or coastal environments.

Tuktoyaktuk Six sources of gravel lie within 10 kilometres of Tuktoyaktuk, all on lnuvialuit private land. Four of the sources {158, 159, 160/161, and 162) are accessible year round, by tundra and ice road in the winter and by barge in the summer. Pit 156 is only accessible by barge in the summer, and 181 is only accessible in the winter by tundra or ice road. There is a total recoverable volume of approximately 13.8 million cubic metres of granular material within 10 kilometres of Tuktoyaktuk, but all of the sources have constraining factors to their development. Four of the six sources contain ground ice, making them difficult to excavate. The constraining factors to development of the six nearest sources to Tuktoyaktuk include location in an environmentally sensitive area {156), overburden (160/161, 159), and location in a fish habitat {162). The gravel found within 10 kilometres of the community is primarily Class 3 {fair quality).

116

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY
The two pits located between 10.1 and 15 kilometres from Tuktoyaktuk also have constraints to development, including being located in an environmentally sensitive area {157) and having major ground ice content {183). There is one source (169) located approximately 17 kilometres from the community that contains 3 mHiion cubic metres of primartly Class 2 (good quality) graveL This particular source is accessible only during the winter by tundra or ice road, however, there are no identified constraints to developing and extracting the pit, nor has ground ice been discovered at this location. The nearest sources of high quality gravel (Ctass 1) are located between 30.1 and 40 kilometres from Tuktoyaktuk. Access to both of these pits (166 and 304) is unconstrained, however, there is only a total recoverable volume of 176,000 cubic metres of gravel. The Parsons Lake site, approximately 60 kilometres from the community contains ten separate pits of gravel of good and fair quality. The major constra ints to development of these sites can potentially be overcome as they are physical constraints-excess overburden and ground ice. Furthermore, three of these sources are accessible year round by winter roads and barge. There is a total of nearly800 million cubic metres of recoverable gravel in the eighty four pits that lie within 100 kilometres ofTuktoyaktuk. However, only 162 million cubic metres of this potential is unconstrained. The best quality gravel available to the community is located more than twenty kilometers away, and is only accessible during the winter season. Furthermore, five of the eighty four pits for Tuktoyaktuk have been completely depleted.

Ulukhaktok The current amount of gravel available to Ulukhaktok is 3.6 million cubic metres, and all of this gravel lies on lnuvialuit private land. There are four sources (87-H-6, 87-H-7, 87-H-8, and 87-H-10) within ten kilometers of the community/ with a recoverable volume of 650,000 cubic metres. Three of the sources are accessible by all-season roads {87-H-6, 87-H-7, and 87-H-8),

while one (87-H-10} is accessible during the winter by winter road and by barge during the summer months. The amount of ground ice within any of the sources lying in dose proximity to Ulukhaktok is unknown. However, 87-H-7 is difficult to access, and 87-H-8 is located underneath the town and therefore not ideal for development. When taking into account the constraints to development of 87-H'-7 and 87-H-8, there is only 275,000 cubic metres of gravel available to the town within ten kilometers. Both of these sources consist of Class 3 (fair quality) granular material. The only source of a higher grade material is at 87-H-7, which is constrained by difficult accessibility. There are five more sources of gravel (87-H-2, 87-H-4, 87-H-5, 87-H-11, and 87-H-12) that fie within 10.1 and 15 kilometres of Ulukhaktok, with a total recoverable volume almost 2 million cubic metres. Four of the five sources are accessible in the winter, and one is accessible year-round by an all-season road (87-H-5). One of the sources is inaccessible during the summer months (87-H-2), while three are accessible by barge, and one by an aU-season road. However, 87-H-5, likely due to its easy accessibility is the most substantially depleted borrow source of any in the vicinity of Ulukhaktok. All of the deposits within 10.1 and 15 kilometres of the community are discontinuously distributed, making them more difficult and expensive to develop.

Two sources of gravel lie at distances of approximately 16 kilometres away from Ulukhaktok (87-H-1 and 87-H-12). Both sources are only accessible during the winter by tundra or ice road, and are inaccessible during the summer. A total of one million cubic metres of gravel exists within the two sources, and no constraints to development have been identified. Overatt there are two sources ofgravel (87-H-6 and 87-H-10) in the nearvicin. tty of Ulukhaktok that are accessible year-round, continuously distributed and have no identified constraints to development. The totat amount of recoverable gravel in these two sources is 275,000 cubic metres. Further afield, between 10.1 and 15 kilometres away, there are two sources of gravel (87-H-4 and 87-H-12) that are accessible year-round, have no constraints to development, :b ut are only semi-continuous in distribution, making them more expensive and labourious to develop. These two sources have a combined recoverable volume of 1.65 million cubic metres of gravel. The highest grade of gravel accessible by the community of Ulukhaktok is the Class 2 {good quality) gravel found at source 87-H-4, which is accessible year round and has no constraints to development, but is located approximately 13 kilometres from the community.

7.4- Impacts of Climate Change on Supply

7.4.1- Shorter Hauling Season
It is expected that the temperature increases that may be experienced in the Mackenzie Delta will produce milder winters which will shorten the ice road season (Natural Resources Canada, 2007, Online; Cohen, 2002, Online). The NWT Clin1ate Change Impacts and

Adaptation Report states that warming in the north has caused later freeze-up in the fall,

119

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

thinner ice throughout the season and earlier spring thaw. These presumed dim ate change impacts have resulted in shorter winter road seasons, despite human efforts to preserve the roads with extra flooding and freezing (NWT ENR, 2008). Data from between 1980 and 2007 (Figure 7.2), shows that there is a correlation between the number of days the lnuvik Tuktoyaktuk ice road is open per season and the average annual temperature in lnuvik. When the average annual air temperature rises, there is generally a corresponding decrease in the number of days for the ice road season that year. This trend was exemplified in the 1997/1998 El Nino year when the mean annual air temperature was -4.6°C, almost two degrees higher than the next highest temperature during the 1980-2007 timeframe. likewise, when the temperature dropped, like in 1985/1986, the number of ice road days increased. Despite an average upwards trend in mean annual air temperature, the ice road season is also generally increasing. This may be attributed to the increasing efforts of ice road maintenance companies to preserve the ice road by carrying out more flooding because of increased demand for ice road use compared to the early 1980s.

companies, and maintained by Nun a Logistics. In 2006, the air temperature at the beginning of the ice road season at Tibbitt Lake was goc higher than the normal average temperature for that time of year. The consequence was a winter road season 67 days shorter than average, and some portions of the road never thickened to a depth that could support the heaviest loads (Katz, 2007, pg. 94). The implications of a shorter winter road season are negative for the granular resources industry. If the winter road season shortens, there will be pressure to move granular resources from their source to their demand points in a shorter period of time. This may be more costly for granular resource haulers, requiring more personnel and equipment to haul gravel during a shorter season, ultimately increasing the cost of acquiring gravel for the end user. There is also potential that the pace of hauling gravel win remain the same due to economic constraints and lack of personnel, thusly decreasing the supply of gravel available to those demanding it, making it an even more competitive resource. As well, if the thickness of the ice roads decreases, this will limit the weight of loads, decreasing the amount of gravel that can be hauled each trip. Although the ice road season will shorten with climate change, there will also be a longer ice free season, which will allow for a longer barge season (Natural Resources Canada, 2007, Online). An issue of concern is the fact that the Northwest Territories Department of Public Works assesses the gravel demands of communities in the spring and summer, but budgeting for the acquisition of granular resource requirements does not reach the communities until January or February of the following year. Because of this, although the winter road season can begin in December, communities do not know whether winter roads will be required to reach

122

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

certain borrow sources. Therefore, the hauling season for gravel for puhlidy~funded projects is often even shorter than the actual winter road season. If a warming climate makes the spring melt of winter roads occur even earlier than at present, the window for hauling may be too short to meet community demands. This in turn will place increased pressures on extractors and haulers to attempt to meet community demands over a shorter period of time (Semmler, 2008, Interview).

7.4.2- Increasing Ground Ice Melt

Mardy Semmler and Kurt Wainman expressed concern that climate change may cause ground ice in gravel deposits to melt faster if the pit is open and the ice is exposed to the atmosphere. This will cause the material to become muddy, sticky and therefore requiring drying before it is usable, making gravel unavailable for immediate use. Climate warming may also increase the amount of granular material required to surround massive ice within a deposit in order to prevent it from melting while the pit is being developed. Just as infrastructure will require additional gravel to prevent permafrost thaw, so might ground ice. This in turn detracts from the total recoverable volume of a borrow source. Therefore, if the dim ate warms and causes increased ground ice melt, pits containing ground ice may become less desirable to develop due to the extra amount of effort required to preserve ground ice, ultimately decreasing the total amount of gravel available to communities for development.

123

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

7.5- Climate Change and Supply
Aklavik There are no gravel sources in the vicinity of Aklavik that are accessible by all-season roads, making the accessibility of all potential borrow sources vulnerable to climate change. The two sources {455 and 467) which are unconstrained for development are accessible during the winter only by tundra or ice road. These two pits are also the sources of the highest quality gravel (Class 3) in the Aklavik area, and are within a relatively reasonable distance (between 20 and 30 kilometres) of the community. The only sources that are accessible year round by winter road and barge are already constrained by poor quality and wildlife.

The community of lnuvik's supply of good and high quality of gravel will be impacted by climate change. These sources lie over 40 kilometres from the community and are accessible only by winter road. There are two sources of gravel that can be reached by all-season roads, however they are of poor quality. The primary source of good quality (Class 2) gravel, Ya Ya lakes, is accessible by winter road only at a distance of approximately 100 kilometres. This source also contains massive ground ice, and its melting could create further obstacles to obtaining gravel. As such, there will be greater pressure to haul more gravel during a shorter period of time in order to meet community needs for good quality gravel for lnuvik.

124

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

Paulatuk The supply of gravel for the community of Paulatuk will be influenced by dim ate change through a shorter hauling season. AU of the sources of granular material surrounding Paulatuk are accessible only during the winter by tundra or ice roads. Without summer access to granular resources, if temperatures warm due to climate change the community may have difficulties accessing gravel because of a shorter hauling season.

Sachs Harbour The community of Sachs Harbour has year-round access to eight out of its thirteen sources of granular material Over the short term, the community's gravel suppty may not be impacted by climate change as the gravel will be accessible year round. However, the most plentiful source of gravel is located further afield, and is only accessible by winter roads. Once the borrow sources within dose proximity of the community are depleted, dim ate change may impact the accessibility of this source, 13 kilometres away.

Tuktoyaktuk The accessibility of good quality gravel for Tuktoyaktuk may be influenced by dim ate change. The nearest source of unconstrained good quality (Class 2) gravel is located approximately twenty kilometers from the community and is only accessible during the winter. The situation is the same for the nearest source of Class 1 gravel which is located 35 kilometres from Tuktoyaktuk. Most of the gravel sources with year round access have constraints to pit development, and as such do not provide viable alternatives for gravel extraction in the face of

125

CHAPTER SEVEN: SUPPLY

climate change. Two of the Parsons lake sources are accessible year round, but have significant amounts of ground ice which may make development of the pit and extraction difficult if a warmer climate causes the ice to melt at a faster rate than normal. Overall, the community of Tuktoyaktuk is likely to experience stresses related to obtaining gravel to meet the community's needs for the upcoming year over a shorter hauling season.

Ulukhaktok Ulukhaktok has one gravel pit (87-H-6) within ten kilometers of the community that has no constraints to development and is accessible by an all season road. Within the same distance is another pit (87-H-10) that is also unconstrained and accessible year round by winter road and barge. Therefore, two of the four pits, consisting of 275,000 cubic metres of material and located within ten kilometers of the community may have no constraints to accessibility due to climate change. There are two other pits (87-H-4 and 87-H-12) that are also accessible year round and without constraints to development. These sources may also remain feasible for extraction in the face of dim ate change due to their year round accessibility, and contain a total volume of 1.65 million cubic metres of material. Source 87-H-4 contains material ofgood quality (Class 2). Overall, it appears that Ulukhaktok may have over 1.9 million cubic metres of gravel within 15 kilometres of the community that will not be impacted by climate change and have no constraints to development.

CHAPTER EIGHT: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
8.1- The Implications of Climate Change for theAvailability of Granular Resources in the ISR The lnuvialuit Settlement Region is experiencing environmental change; the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the globe. Specifically, the Mackenzie District, in which much of the ISR lies experienced a temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius between 1948 and 2005, whereas the rest of the Canadian Arctic experienced only a 1.2 degree increase. The prognosis for the Arctic suggests that climate change is occurring and that the temperatures in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region are likely to continue to increase in years to come. With climate change will come change to the dynamics of demand and supply of granular resources on which communities depend for infrastructure construction and maintenance.

8.1.1- Climate Change and Demand for Granular Resources

The amount of gravel used for the construction of new infrastructure has already increased by fifteen to twenty percent (Macleod, lnterview,2008), and will continue to do so as the active layer thickens and air temperatures increase due to climate change. If atmospheric temperatures increase by 6.5 degrees by 2100 as has been predicted, the active layer could thaw up to 70 centimetres in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, making it necessary to increase the thickness of gravel pads beneath infrastructure by this depth as well For projects such as the proposed lnuvik-Tuktoyaktuk highway, increasing temperatures could double granular resource requirements in order to abate and mitigate climate change related infrastructure failure. Currently, there is not sufficient information to determine whether regional demand for gravel, including increased demand due to climate change and economic development, will exceed the amount ofgravel that is available to the communities.

127

CHAPTER EIGHT: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
8.1.2- Climate Change and Supply of Granular Resources

Although there is a significant quantity of gravel within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region, the extraction of much of it is not feasible. Currently, some granular resource borrow sources are inaccessible to communities due to seasonal access, large amounts ofground ice, and the presence of environmentally-significant factors (wildlife, breeding grounds). Furthermore, it is difficult for communities (specifically, Aklavik and Tuktoyaktuk) to access granular resources of high quality. The inaccessibility of gravel will be significantly exacerbated by dim ate change. The gravel supply will be limited by shorter ice and tundra road seasons, decreasing the amount of gravel that communities can haul to meet summer construction needs. Ukewise, the melting of ice within the gravel sources will make it more difficult to extract, and ultimately result in less available material. Aklavik and Paulatuk will.he the communities most impacted by climate change in terms of gravel accessibility, each having no unconstrained year-round access to gravel sources. Meanwhile, lnuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, the two communities demanding the most gravel may have difficulty accessing gravel of good quality for infrastructure construction. Sources of higher quality gravel for these communities are only accessible during the winter, and dim ate change will add pressure to move more gravel in a shorter period of time. Sachs Harbour and Ulukhaktok are the two communities with the least gravel demands, and have sources that will likely not be impacted by dimate change as they are accessible year-round. Overan, Aklavik, Paulatuk, lnuvik and Tuktoyaktuk are the lnuvialuit Settlement Regron communities most likely to experience shortfalls in gravel supply due to climate change.

128

CHAPTER EIGHT: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
8.2- Towards a Granular Resource Management Plan
Without an established granular resource management plan for land managers of the three jurisdictions within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region to follow, the resource cannot be managed in a sustainable way. With uncertainty about the future demand for gravel, as well as the amount of gravel that is available, it is evident that a granular resources management plan must be put into place in the region. Thus far, there have been no studies focusing on the management of granular resources in the face of climate change. The following are recommendations based upon the research for this paper and discussions with stakeholders in the region for the development and implementation of an ISR-wide granular resources management plan that considers potential vulnerability presented by dimate change. In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between INAC and I LA, a granular resources management plan working group wiH need to work together to create a management plan with the overall goal of sustainable granular resource management within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region. Based upon the findings of this research paper, that climate change may impact the supply of and demand for granular resources, an additional objective of managing gravel sustainably in light of a changing environment should be added. The key elements to a granular resources management plan where sustainable management of gravel is the goal include an accurate supply inventory of resources within the region, an accurate demand forecast for gravel use by all potential users for the upcoming 20 years, and pit management plans for the most commonly utilized pits surrounding communities. Each of these elements wm require significant dedicated man-hours by llA and INAC, as well as investment in consulting services.

129

CHAPTER EIGHT: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In order to develop a more accurate supply inventory than currently exists, it is necessary to identify which pits are the most commonly used surrounding each community. This can be done by a combination of methods)> including anaJyzing quarry permits to determine which pits are mostcommonly extracted from. However, it is recognized that gravel is often taken from pits without a permit, and thus, further consulting with theJSR communities will be required to determine where un-permitted grave~ extraction is occurring. A series of community consultations with community organizations including each hamlet or town office and community corporations, may give an indication of which pits are the most vital to community infrastructure development. It can then be decided upon which pits are the most crucial to re-assess in terms of the amount of available gravel as well as constraints to development (specifically, phys~cal constraints that require measurement such as ice content). Therefore, money and consultant efforts can be concentrated on the sources that are of the most importance to community wellbeing at present,and an accurate depiction of supp.ly can be obtained for those pits. likewise, an accurate demand forecast is crucial to the development of a granular resources management plan. In order to obtain information about demand for the upcoming 20 years, it will be necessary to speak to any potentiaf granular resource users in the region and acquire demand information. In the past responses to demand forecast inquiries have been low, and as such, efforts will have to be placed into stressing the importance of participation in demand forecasting as part of the region's granular resource management plan. Furthermore, within the management plan dimate change scenarios for granular resource demand could be built into the demand forecasts. Currently, for the creation of their

130

CHAPTER EIGHT: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
demand forecasts for gravel requirements, the Government of the Northwest Territories refers to a table which suggests the amount of gravel required for the construction of different types of new infrastructure, including fire halls, gas stations, sewage lagoons, etc. (The Interdepartmental Granular Resource Acquisition Committee, 2007}. It would be ideal if these figures could be recalculated to reflect the amount of gravel that would be required to construct infrastructure under a climate change scenario (for example, an increase in the depth of the active layer by 70 centimetres over the next 100 years), and be included in the granular resource management plan. likewise, a separate table could be constructed to suggest how much gravel would be required to abate the impacts of climate change on existing infrastructure, for example, the amount of extra fill needed by each of the types of infrastructure listed in the original table .. Once such a table is constructed, when demand surveys are being conducted the user can be asked whether their design plans take into account the prospect of climate change. If not, the demand value for granular resources estimated by the user can be recalculated to reflect a more realistic figure of resources required. Then, overall, land managers would be presented with two figures: demand without consideration of dim ate change, and potential demand if the dim ate does warm to the extent suggested by the climate scenario. This information could be used to allocate resources in a more sustainable manner, taking into account climate change as a potential cause for major demand ofresources, which is especially necessary to do before approving licenses for other projects with significant competing demands for resources such as the Mackenzie Gas Project or the lnuvik Tuktoyaktuk highway. In doing S0 1 land managers within the lnuvialuit Settlement Region will be better equipped to achieve the priorities of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement.

131

CHAPTER EIGHT: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Finally, the granular resources management plan will require pit management plans for the most commonly used pits in the region (as identified when re-evaluating the supply inventory). Pit management plans can be developed by each pit's owner, and these will serve as rules that proponents must follow when extracting gravel from a pit. Each pit management plan should detail the order in which different areas of the pit should be extracted from, physical constraints that must be avoided (ground ice, etc.), what must be done with overburden, and how the pit should be restored upon completion of quarry operations. The key to preventing community vulnerability related to infrastructure failure due to climate change is the development a management plan in order to ensure the sustainable allocation ofgranular resources. The development of a granufar resources management plan has been seemingly avoided thus far for several reasons including high staff turnover and a lack of dedicated staff resources to developing a plan, a lack of coordination between the federal government and the lnuvialuit land Administration, and a deficiency of critical information necessary for forming a granular resources management ptan. Such a managementplan is a necessity due to the stresses faced by the region including climate change and competing demands for resources by the Mackenzie Gas Project and the potentiallnuvik-Tuktoyaktuk highway. Furthermore, the lnuviafuit land Administration must ensure that the principles of the lnuvialuit Final Agreement are adhered to when managing land and resources in the ISR, including ensuring the socio-economic well-being of the lnuvialuit beneficiaries would include preserving the infrastructure on which they depend for survival and economic activity. As such, the development of a granular resources management plan is of

132

CHAPTER EIGHT: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
the utmost importance in order to ensure that granular resources are managed in a manner that will allow for the sustenance and growth of lnuvialuit communities now and in the future.

APPENDIX B: QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES
*Has noticed that roads are being impacted more by warmer temperatures, sinking due to permafrost melt and poor road maintenance. Roads sink into the tundra faster than they used to. Todd Romaine Chief Land Administrator, lnuvialuit Land Administration *Gravel is the most important issue of the lnuvialuit land Administration. Gravel is one of the most problematic land resources to manage, and no one seems to have a solid handle on their management in the !SR. *As part of a granular resource management plan, the process of setup, monitoring, and cleanup of a pit needs to be outlined and followed by land administrators from beginning to end. *With the impending lnuvik Tuktoyaktuk Highway and the Mackenzie Gas Project, a management plan needs to be developed as soon as possible *More appropriate land management from all levels of government needs to occur, monitoring how much gravel is taken and that the terms of quarry licenses and land use permits are met. *Frequent staff turnover causes issues to be put on the "back burner," including the completion of a current demand forecast. Kyle Sherwin Program Manager, Environmental Projects, lnuvialuit land Administration *Demand forecasts have not been conducted as frequently as required by the lnuvialuit Final Agreement *ice roads are used in the winter > transport equipment to uction) sites/quarries, and gravel is also hauled from the sites during the winter. If temperatures increase, hauling season will get shorter,

-

*!nuvialuit land Administration needs to start tracking community gravel use better, people often go to quarries and take gravel without being permitted to. There is little monitoring of unauthorized use. Susan Chaytor Consultant, Alpha Corporation *Participation rate for demand surveys is low, it is difficult to make contact with ali gravel users. *Climate change may have an irnpa!..t on the accessibility of granular <

sources, and could cause iu~.., t:a:>~::J · · · · · demand for granular resources. < *Access to pits and quarries will impacted by climate change.

APPENDIX B: QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES
*Most community granular resupply operations within the ISR are dependent on winter or ice roads to develop the deposit. Climate change will impact the timing ofconstruction of seasonal access roads, limiting the development of granular resources.
