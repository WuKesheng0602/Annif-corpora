BRITE PROJECTOVERLOAD DETECTION/HEALTH MONITORINGLANDING GEAR SENSOR SYSTEM PROPOSAL Bradley William Baird Ryerson University, Masters of Applied Science, Aerospace Engineering. 2008

In recent years, both the major aircraft manufacturers and airline customers have asked landing gear suppliers to begin the development of a viable overload detection/health monitoring system (ODHMS) for in-service and future aircraft landing gear projects. At present, there is no reliable/quantifiable means of determining whether a landing gear has been overloaded during both landing and ground maneuvering conditions. Instead, airlines and aircraft manufacturers rely on a combination of the pilot's judgment and flight recorder data. This thesis outlines current overload detection methods and their shortcomings. It also proposes two possible ODHMS system configurations and provides the basic algorithms required to predict the applied loads acting on the landing gear. Both ODHMS systems require the use of strain gauges and potential gauge types are reviewed. Finally, a technology development test plan is outlined to produce a mature ODHMS to be placed on the next generation single aisle aircraft platform.

Chapter 1: Introduction

The purpose of this thesis is to outline a potential platform for developing a landing gear overload detection I health monitoring system for both in-service and future aircraft programs. The proposed system will enable airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and landing gear suppliers to measure and predict the following:

Â· Â· Â·

Aircraft Weights and Balance Overload Detection during Landing/Ground Maneuvering Long-Term fatigue life prediction of landing gear components (Health Monitoring)

In recent years, both the major aircraft manufacturers and airline customers have asked landing gear suppliers to begin the development of a viable overload detection system for in-service and future aircraft landing gear projects. At present, there is no reliable/quantifiable means of determining whether a landing gear has been overloaded during both landing and ground maneuvering conditions. Instead, airlines and aircraft manufacturers rely on a combination of the pilot's judgment and flight recorder data (such as sink rate, approach speed, and aircraft acceleration).

The current means of assessing whether an overload condition has occurred has many shortcomings, a few of which are listed below:

1.

Individual pilots will have varying opinions on what constitutes a hard landing (i.e. the assessment is qualitative in nature). Furthermore, if the pilot has a tight schedule of flights, he/she may be under pressure to continue flying without reporting potential hard landing conditions.

2.

It is very difficult, even with sink rate, approach speed, and acceleration data to predict the impact loads on the landing gear. This data requires a large amount of engineering analysis from both a dynamics and structural point of view with no guarantees on the validity of the predicted loads.

-1-

If the pilot does report a hard landing, then the aircraft is grounded (AOG). Once the aircraft is

grounded, various levels of inspection are required up to, and including, removal of the landing

gear from the aircraft. This scenario can create large expenses to airlines and also cause loss revenue.

Due to recent technology developments, the ability for landing gear manufacturers to provide a overload detection system for both current and future products has become achievable. This thesis will outline a proposed means of detecting hard landings utilizing the latest strain gauge technologies. Due to the measuring techniques utilized for hard landing detection, this system also provide the following additional data:

1.
2.

aircraft weights and balance to the pilot before take-off long-term fatigue life monitoring and prediction

The main goals of this thesis are the following:

Â·

To propose a framework for a landing gear overload detection/health monitoring syste1 (ODHMS)

Â·

To develop a system that uses a minimum amount of strain gauges to monitor ground loads applied to the landing gear for in-service aircraft

Â·

To develop mathematical algorithms to convert sensor readings into ground loads

Overload Types
Overload conditions for landing gear can be classified into two categories:

1. Hard Landing 2. Ground Maneuvering

1.2.1

Hard Landing
Typically, hard landings are caused by one or more of the following:

1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

The aircraft landing weight exceeds the maximum allowable landing weight (MLW) High sink rate (i.e.
~

10 ft/s which is considered the limit load scenario)

Nose landing gear touchdown prior to main landing gear

Aircraft roll angle at touchdown is such that one main landing gear absorbs initial impac Aircraft overshoots/undershoots the runway Drift landings that cause high drag/side loads on the landing gear

1.2.2

Ground Maneuvering
Overload conditions can also be caused while the aircraft is on the ground and maneuvering. Some conditions that may cause overloading of the landing gear are as follows:

1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

High speed turn that produces high lateral g-levels High deceleration due to braking Excessive pivoting Towing incidents (overload or overrun) Wheel/tire failure Tire burst and tread throw Maximum nose wheel steering angle exceeded

-8-

Chapter 2: Historic Background

2.1

Overload Detection
References 8, 13

Overloading can be defined as any combination of ground loads acting on the landing gear which causes one or more individual components to yield. Overloading scenarios can occur during both landing and ground maneuvers. Historically, overload detection has been limited to pilot opinion.

Currently, there is no viable quantitative means of assessing whether a hard landing has occurred on a landing gear. As a result, if the pilot reports that a hard landing has occurred, complex inspections may result.

2.1.1

Inspection Procedures
Historically, when a hard landing has been reported by the pilot, a series of inspections are required before the landing gear can be cleared for further flights. Initially, the inspection requirements will be limited to visual inspections conducted while the landing gear is still attached to the aircraft.

These initial inspections are typically named Phase I inspections and will include inpsection of the following:

1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

Tires and Wheels Shock strut fluid leakage Airframe attachment pin distortion (i.e. ovalization of pins) Bushing migration In-stops for shock strut bottoming indication (see below)
1

To prevent the piston from impacting the top of the outer cylinder, mechanical stops are typically included in the design of the shock strut.

If, after these initial inspections, there are indications that an overload has occurred, a Phase II

inspection is required. Phase II inspections are much more involved and require the aircraft tot put on jacks so that the landing gear no longer supports the aircraft weight. Once the aircraft is on the jacks, the following procedures are typically completed:

1.

Retract/extend the nose and main landing gears with the normal system to ensure that joints or components have detrimentally deformed. If the landing gears do not retract normally, this would be a strong indication that an overload scenario has occurred.

r

2.

Retract/extend the main and nose landing gears using the manual system for similar reasons as 1.

3.

Examine principal structural elements of the landing gear for damage/deformation (sucl as axles, outer cylinder, torque links, piston, drag brace, side brace, shock strut, etc.)

4.

Complete a check on the shock strut fluid level

If any of these visual inspections indicate that an overload may have occurred, the landing gear removed from the aircraft and sent to a qualified facility for detailed Non-Destructive Testing (NOT). Depending on the component material, the following NOT tests may be performed in or to detect cracking:

Â· Â·

Magnetic Particle Inspection Die Penetrant Inspection

If, after completion of the NOT tests, there are no indications of cracking, one of the following h steps will be taken:

1.

The landing gear will be cleared for flight and re-installed on the aircraft

- 10-

2.

If the component material is prone to stress corrosion cracking, the component may be placed on a shelf for 2-6 months. If, after this period, no cracks have formed, the component will be cleared for flight and re-installed on the aircraft.

Due to the space limitations in aircraft structure and the significant loads that landing gears are subjected to, high strength steels and aluminums are utilized. Both of these materials can be prone to stress corrosion cracking when exposed to relatively high sustained stresses. These components can also fail due to stress corrosion once they have undergone plastic deformation. If a component undergoes relatively high tensile plastic deformation without rupturing, the component will fail due to long-term exposure to the atmosphere. For further details on stress corrosion cracking, refer to reference 1.

2.1.2

Qualitative Tables

In the past five years, GLG has worked in conjunction with an aircraft manufacturer to develop a more efficient method of qualitatively assessing whether a hard landing has occurred. This

qualitative assessment requires the airframe manufacturer to identify the type of overload scena (i.e. high sink rate, drift landing, nose wheel over-steering, etc.). Once the overloading scenario has been identified, engineers and aircraft maintenance personnel utilize a series of tables and figures to identify which components on the landing gear require inspection.

Based on this methodology, the airframe manufacturer must still rely on flight recorder data for g levels, sink rates, approach speeds, etc. However, during ground maneuvering and towing scenarios, the flight recorder data may not contain any valuable data for overload prediction. In either scenario, the pilot will still be relied up to report and evaluate the severity of the overload event.

For this method to be successful, the landing gear supplier must identify key components on the landing gear that could be detrimentally deformed during an overload event. As an example, torque links transfer torque acting on the landing gear from the piston/axle to the outer cylinder.

Under a hard landing event which produces high vertical loads on the landing gear, the torque lir

would not be significantly loaded. As a result, the landing gear supplier would not recommend tt inspection of the torque links for this type of event.

An example of a qualitative table is provided on the following page. In this chart, a specific type landing scenario has been assumed:

Â· Â· Â· Â·

Various Drag and Vertical Load Combinations A set shock strut stroke of 435 mm A side load based on 0.35 x the vertical force All loads are evenly distributed amongst the wheels

For ease of understanding, assume that the airframe manufacturer has determined from the flig data recorder that a drift landing has occurred with the following post loads:

Vertical= 2000 kN Drag = 1500 kN Side= 700 kN

Based on the data above, a point can be drawn on Figure 2-2. Based on this point on the curve the airline maintenance personnel would be directed to inspect, as a minimum, the drag brace f - 12-

pin and outboard main pintle pin. If, after these initial inspections, there are indications that these pins have yielded, a more thorough inspection of other components would be required.

Boeing Overload Detection Method
On the Boeing 777 program, an overload detection system was developed and patented by Boeing (see reference 10). This system utilizes resistance strain gauges placed at key locations on the main landing gear system and surrounding aircraft structure. The intent of the system is to quantitatively measure the forces that can cause structural damage to an airplane that has experienced a hard landing event. The goal of the system is to make the decision that the aircraft requires a hard landing inspection before it is allowed to fly again.

As with the system proposed by in this thesis, the key measurement to determine the applied ground loads is strain. The system is able to utilize any strain measuring device that outputs an electronic signal. In the patent, Boeing offers suggested locations for strain gauge measurement but does not specifically specify where the ideal measurement points should be located. Some of the suggested locations are shown in the figure below:

Truck/Bogie Beam

FIGURE 2-3: PROPOSED STRAIN MEASUREMENT LOCATiq

For landing gear systems with more than two wheels, a bogie/truck beam is required in the desig to attach the 2+ axles to the shock strut. For this configuration, measuring strain levels at the bogie beam would be advantageous. If this configuration was utilized, a minimum of six strain gauges would be needed at both the fore and aft sides of the bogie beam (with reference to the shock strut axis). Measuring strains at the bogie beam would provide the fore/aft split of the overall post loads being applied to the landing gear.

Boeing also proposes measuring strain levels at the airframe attachment pin locations.

General!~

speaking, measuring strain levels at the aircraft attachment pins will provide some indication of tt applied forces to the landing gear. Due to the means by which aircraft attachment pins are connected to the aircraft, only shear forces will be able to be measured by the pins (see figure below):

Depending on the landing gear configuration, the thrust load reactions at the airframe will either I a direct result of the applied drag or side loads to the landing gear. These two applied loads will also produce a shear couple reaction at the airframe attachments but this will be difficult to separate from the shear reaction due to the vertical force and applied moments at the post. An example case with drag, braking torque, and vertical loads is provided on the following page.

FIGURE 2-5: EXAMPLE LOAD CASE AND RESLUTING REACTIONS

From the figure above, the three post loads applied produce two shear reactions at the aircraft attachment points and one thrust reaction component. Since the pin solution does not have the capability to measure the thrust reaction, the shear measurements in the pin will not provide adequate data to solve for the three unknowns. As a result, this system can only be used during landing when it is known that the brakes are not powered.

2.3

Health Monitoring

In recent years, many engineering disciplines have been developing systems to monitor the load

acting on structures for extended periods of time. Typically, the loads are monitored indirectly b measuring strain levels at key regions within the structure. The strains are then converted into loads via calibration from testing, finite element analysis, or traditional hand calculations.

By continuously monitoring the ground loads acting on a landing gear while in service, the fatiguE life of individual components can be predicted. Therefore, components that have seen higher

fatigue loads than predicted can be removed from the landing gear before failure occurs in servic

Conversely, landing gear components that have theoretical life limitations may see fatigue loads

significantly lower than predicted. As a result, components with life limitations may have service lives extended due to health monitoring.

A structural health monitoring (SHM) system includes the following elements:

Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·

Structure Sensors Data acquisition systems Data transfer and storage mechanism Data management Data interpretation and diagnosis

An example of this technology is embedding sensors in structures like bridges and aircraft.

The~

sensors provide real time monitoring of various structural changes like stress and strain. In the case of civil engineering structures, the data provided by the sensors is usually transmitted to a remote data acquisition centre.

This section outlines the uses of health monitoring in both the civil engineering and aerospace fields.

2.3.1

Civil Engineering Industry
Although many engineering disciplines have begun to develop health monitoring systems, the ci engineering industry has become the leaders in this technology development. As the designs a construction of civil structures continues to evolve, it has become crucial that these structures b monitored for their health. If these structures are monitored over long periods of time, prematur catastrophic failures can be prevented or their lives may be extended.

- 18-

In Canada, it is estimated that infrastructure systems have a total asset value of $2 trillion dollars. Many of these structures are deteriorating over time due to the following:

Â· Â· Â·

inadequate maintenance excessive loading adverse environment conditions

Generally speaking, infrastructure systems are not monitored for their health. As a result, it is difficult for engineers to predict the state of health of these structures.

Over the past decade, SHM's have been developed to conduct long-term health monitoring. The first civil structure worldwide to incorporate a full SHM system into its initial design is the Taylor Bridge in Headingly, Manitoba. The health of this bridge will be monitored remotely for its lifetime.

Typically, structural health monitoring in the civil engineering industry involves the use of FibreBragg fibre optic strain gauges. These strain gauges are bonded to key regions of structure such as bridges and these strain levels are monitored over long periods of time.

2.3.2

Aerospace Industry
See reference 8 for details.

Structural health monitoring could play a significant role in maintaining the safety of both new and aged aerospace structures that are subject to cyclic loading. For such structures, the development of an integrated sensory system able to monitor, collect, and predict the structural health is essential. The commercial aerospace applications of an SHM are in their infancy but both airframe manufacturers and airline customers are interested in developing SHM systems.

Aging aircraft are of major concern to the engineering community because of the following issues encountered in-service with these aircraft:

Â· Â· Â·

Multi-site fatigue damage Hidden cracks in hard to reach locations Corrosion

Creating a health monitoring system for new and aging fleets is the subject of major research in universities, government labs, and industry. Prevention of fatigue failures on in-service aircraft could be greatly improved by implementing a reliable SHM system. In fact, such a system would be capable of assessing the aircraft's structural integrity and would be able to detect initial damage before catastrophic failure occurs. - 19-

Another added benefit of introducing an SHM system is the ability to reduce maintenance costs throughout an aircraft's life. Today, inspections and structural health monitoring are completed manually. Manual inspections are costly to airliners for two key reasons- the cost of labour and the loss of revenue while the aircraft is grounded.

Chapter 3: Sensing System Options

3.1

Strain Gauges
The strain gauge setup described in section 7.0 does not limit the choice of strain gauge to be used for ground load measurement. The following strain gauges could potentially be placed on a landing gear load monitoring system:

Â· Â· Â· Â·

Resistance Fibre Bragg Grating fibre optic Fabyr-Perot fibre optic Goodrich Silicon MEMS technology

As will be discussed in detail in section 7.0, the algorithms developed to predict the ground loads applied to the landing gear require strain outputs. The type of sensing system developed for the ODHMS system does not require that strain be measured directly. In other words, if a more efficient sensing system can be developed that measures displacement instead of strain, it would not affect the algorithms developed in this thesis. The only requirement for the system is to convert the direct measurement of displacement into strain levels.

3.1.1

Resistance Strain Gauge
The resistance strain gauge has been used in test flight programs for many aircraft with success. Resistance strain gauge technology is mature and well understood and, for these reasons, could be a potential candidate for use in an load monitoring system. However, using a system based on resistance strain gauge technology may be difficult for the following reasons:

Â· Â·

Frequent need to zero gauges due to strain drift (i.e. maintenance required) Could cause electromagnetic interference (EM I) with critical aircraft/landing gear systems

- 21 -

3.1.2

Fibre Bragg Grating Fibre Optic Strain Gauges

Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) fibre optic strain gauges are a more recent development in strain ga_ ug technology. Currently, it is being used heavily in civil engineering as a measurement tool for long

term health monitoring of bridges. In the aerospace industry, FBG gauges have been imbedded i composite structures in order to monitor loads and to detect the onset of debonding. FBG technology has many benefits:

Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·

Robust Does not need to be zeroed (i.e. less maintenance) Electrically passive (i.e. does not produce EM I) Only one cable required for all strain gauges Less time to install than electrical resistance gauges Insensitive to transverse strain Highly resistant to temperature and moisture

On the other hand, FBG technology has some disadvantages as well:

Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·

If bulb burns out, no data can be acquired for any gauge The bulb is relatively expensive to replace If cable is damaged, no data can be acquired for any gauge Each gauge requires second gauge for temperature correction During retraction and extension of the landing gear, the fibre optic cable would bend significantly. If the bending radius required is too severe, the fibre could fail statically or due to fatigue

-22-

3.1.3

Fabyr-Perot Fibre Optic Strain Gauge
The Fabyr-Perot (FP) type fibre optic strain gauge has many of the same advantages as the FBG type fibre optic gauge. Some distinctive advantages are as follows:

Â· Â· Â· Â·

No need for second gauge to correct for temperature Separate cable for each gauge Separate light source for each gauge Light source is extremely cheap to replace relative to FBG gauge

The disadvantages to using an FP fibre optic gauge are as follows:

Â· Â· Â·

More maintenance required (i.e. bulb replacement/cable repair) More installation required than FBG due to multiple cables During retraction and extension of the landing gear, the fibre optic cable would bend significantly. If the bending radius required is too severe, the fibre could fail statically or due to fatigue

3.1.4

Goodrich Silicon MEMS Technology
Goodrich Sensor Systems designs, develops and produces micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) for high-performance sensors and actuators. In recent years, Goodrich Sensors has developed a silicon MEMS strain gauge that could be used in landing gear load monitoring applications. Using a MEMS style strain gauge would have the following advantages:

Â· Â· Â·

Sensor package is smaller and lighter Higher reliability and less expensive then other sensor systems High Precision

Although this strain gauge type has some advantages to other systems, this sensor type does not have a large amount of in-service history and, as such, the product is not mature.

-23-

3.2

Accelerometers

Another load monitoring system that has been proposed is to place accelerometers at key locations on the landing gear. These key locations would be the following:

Â· Â·

Axle tip Shock Strut

The axle tip would be an ideal location to place an accelerometer because it has a relatively high amount of deflection that will occur when load is applied at the wheels. The shock strut is also ideal since it will displace significant during the initial touchdown phase and during taxiing. This

system would be relatively simple to implement in today's airline market since accelerometers are used extensively on in-service aircraft.

There are three fundamental problems with the accelerometer sensing approach:

1.

An accurate stiffness/mass distribution of the landing gear and support structure is required .

2.

The shock strut dynamic airspring curve must be accurately known. During in-service us

the airspring curve may deviate from the design curve due to leakage of shock strut oil ar nitrogen. 3. Accelerometers will aid in the prediction of highly dynamic loading events (such as Iandin only. For ground maneuvering cases that are quasi-static in nature, accelerations at the shock strut and axle tips are relatively low. Therefore, these readings will not aid in calculating the applied ground loads.

-24-

3.3

Thesis Proposed System
Generally speaking, airline customers are hesitant to implement new types of sensing systems unless it is required by the airframe manufacturer and/or the aviation authorities. Introducing additional sensing systems to the aircraft can create additional costs to the airliner due to increased maintenance due to increased risks of system failures. In other words, as system complexity increases, the probability of systems related maintenance increases.

For both airframe manufacturers and airliners to accept an ODHMS type system, the landing gear designer must provide a system that fulfills the following requirements:

Â· Â· Â· Â·

Minimum complexity Reliable ground load predictions Ability to achieve either the overhaul life (typical half of the aircraft life) or full life Minimum power and weight impact to aircraft

All of these requirements point to the need to design an ODHMS architecture that is as simple as possible. To achieve the need for simplicity, it is imperative to keep the amount of sensors to a minimum while still maintain accurate ground load measurements. In order to keep the amount of sensors required to predict the ground loads applied to the landing gear to a minimum, it is imperative to place the sensors as close to the load application points as possible (i.e. the wheels). As a result, I propose to investigate two different configurations of strain gauge monitoring systems:

Â· Â·

Wheel load measurement at axle root Post load measurement

These two configurations are illustrated conceptually for the following types of landing gear designs:

Â· Â·

Cantilever Aft Articulated

Refer to the following pages for the strain gauge system proposals outlined above.

3.3.1

Aft Articulated- Post Loads

For aft articulated landing gear designs, a series of strain gauges can be placed at the base of thi structural post and on the shock strut to measure the applied post loads. At this time, GLG does not intend to develop a specific strain gauge configuration for this type of landing gear. As such, do not cover any type of algorithm or calibration development.

Strain gauge rosette need o shock strut to measure axia load acting on strut and to correct for hoop stress due t internal pressure.

Strain gauge rosettes may be needed to measure torque and shear at this location in lieu of bending and axial load.

3.4

Strain Gauge Attachment to Structure
Generally speaking, there are three ways that strain gauges can be attached to structure:

Â· Â· Â·

Adhesive bonding Welding Mechanical means

All three methods each have benefits and consequences:

TABLE 3-1: PROS AND CONS OF STRAIN GAUGE ATTACHMENT METHODS
Adhesive - does not produce stress concentration - flight test programs for many aircraft have successfully used adhesives to bond strain gauges to components - substrate cannot have any protective coatings in region of bond (i.e. can introduce region prone to corrosion) - bond can slowly degrade over time due to fatigue and environmental conditions Welding - does not produce stress concentration creates a permanent bond between the strain gauge and component Mechanical

Benefit

- strain gauge permanently fixed to the part without the need to bond

Consequence

- can adversely affect the mechanical properties of the component in the region of the weld

- introduces stress concentration to part

Chapter 4: Landing Gear Analysis Theory

4.1

Landing Gear Structural Modelling
Traditionally, landing gear structural modeling has entailed idealizing the complete structure as a series of beam and shell elements (see below):

Â·

FIGURE 4-1: AN EXAMPLE OF A STRUCTURAL BEAM MODEL
-30-

Creating a beam model of the landing gear allows stress/fatigue engineers to determine the internal forces and moments acting at any given point on the landing gear. This type of model also allows the use of large displacement theory which considers secondary loading effects due to structural deflections.

The internal loads predicted by the beam model can then be used to both size and analyze the landing gear components that have been represented in the model. The process is iterative in nature - once the internal forces are used to size components, the new section properties are then applied to the beam model. Once the properties are updated, all load cases are rerun since the stiffness of the beam model has changed due to the new section properties. Typically, a beam model is updated five to ten times over the development period of a landing gear design (approximately three years).

4.2

Superposition Principle
The principle of superposition states that the deflections at any point in a structure is equal to the sum of the deflections caused by each load acting separately. This principle also applies to internal loads, stresses, strains, etc. For the principle of superposition to apply to a structure, the following assumptions are made:

Â· Â· Â·

Small displacement Small strain Linear elastic material behaviour

For landing gear structures, it can be argued that, under cyclic fatigue loading conditions, the majority of the applied loads will not violate the assumptions stated above. For overload and limit load conditions, the superposition principle may not be valid. In fact, this assumption may be optimistic since the effects of secondary loading will not be taken into account using the superposition principle.

Regardless of the shortcomings of the superposition principle for overload and limit load conditions, this thesis makes use of this principle for internal loads prediction for both overload and fatigue. This assumption must be viewed as an initial indicator of overload only. Once an overload condition has been predicted, detailed engineering analysis may be required to further refine the analysis.

- 31 -

4.3

Discrete Section Analysis
Traditionally, landing gear components have been analyzed for both static strength and fatigue life

based on discrete section analysis. Discrete section analysis is the process whereby and engineer cuts a cross-section at key locations on a component and completes the following steps:

1. 2.

Calculate section properties (i.e. area, moment of inertia, bending modulus, etc.) Calculate the applied loads at the section (i.e. bending, shear, internal pressure, etc.). This step is typically done by referencing the beam model internal loads.

3. 4.

Calculate the resulting stresses based on the calculations completed in step 1 and 2 For fatigue, calculate the equivalent uniaxial stress (Von Mises or Principal Stress) For static strength, compare the individual stresses to the appropriate allowable (i.e. bending, shear, etc.).

Discrete section analysis is a very powerful tool to be used with the beam model finite element results for both static and fatigue analysis. It is relatively quick to complete and it also provides insight to the engineer as to what types of load are driving the stress levels at the discrete section.

An example discrete section analysis is provided on the following pages. The analysis output is based on a GLG proprietary software named 'Stress Tools.'

Finite Element Analysis As both finite element software and computer hardware develops, finite element analysis is becoming more dominant as an analysis tool for engineers designing and analyzing landing gear.

Chapter 5: Static Analysis- Overload Detection

Overload detection can be categorized into two classes:

Â· Â·

Component yielding Component failure (i.e. rupture)

For both cases, traditional equations are utilized to predict yield and/or rupture. For the scenario where a components ruptures, visual inspections by maintenance crews will indicate that a component has failed. As a result, the analysis presented in this thesis will focus entirely on predicting the onset of yield in individual components.

5.1

Yielding Criteria
For ductile metals, the Von Mises criterion is typically utilized to predict yielding in a component. This criterion is also known as the Maximum Distortion Energy Criterion. According to this criterion, a given structural component is safe as long as the maximum value of the distortion energy per unit volume in that material remains smaller than the distortion energy per unit volume required to cause yielding in a tensile-test specimen of the same material. The Von Mises equation for a 30 stress state is given below:

(5.1.1)

For a 20 stress state, the Von Mises stress is simplified to the following:

(5.1.2)

In general, if yield checks are completed for finite element results, the stress state will be 30 since the majority of landing gear components are analyzed as 30 solids. On the other hand, traditional discrete section cut analysis is in 20 which allows the use of the simplified Von Mises formula for a 20 stress state. Refer to reference 144, pages 368 to 369 for further details.

Chapter 6: Fatigue Analysis

I will utilize both stress-life and strain-life theory to predict the life of landing gear components. This section briefly summarizes the two theories and is based on references 1 and 5. Stress-life theory is ideal for components that undergo high cycle fatigue (HCF) and relatively low stress levels. Strain-life theory is ideal for components that undergo low cycle fatigue (LCF) and relatively high stress levels. In the LCF regime, strain-life theory is equivalent to stress-life theory.

6.1

Stress-Life Theory (S-N)
Traditionally, landing gear fatigue analysis was performed using stress-life theory. Practically speaking, stress-life is an easy-to-use analysis tool for fatigue life prediction of landing gear components. However, since landing gear components experience both LCF and HCF, stress-life application is fairly limited in landing gear fatigue analysis. Typically, components such as actuators and uplock mechanisms use stress-life theory since the spectrums are relatively simple and HCF applies.

The general equations used in stress-life theory are provided below:

Strain-Life Theory (E-N)
Strain-Life fatigue is much more robust for predicting fatigue life of components that undergo plasticity during their service life. Currently, the majority of landing gear components use strain-life theory since these components are typically exposed to both HCF and low cycle fatigue (LCF).

6.2.1

Monotonic Stress-Strain Relationship

Where

The monotonic strain-stress relationship can now be written in the following form:

(6.2.4)

This equation is often referred to as the Ramberg-Osgood equation.

6.2.2

Cyclic Stress-Strain Relationship
Cyclic stress-strain curves are fundamental to the use of strain-life fatigue theory for determining the durability of structures under cyclic loading. The response of a material subjected to inelastic loading is in the form of a hysteresis loop (shown on the following page).

Strain-Life Equation - Mean Stress Correction
The strain-life equation derived in the previous section does not take into account the effects of mean stress on the fatigue life of a component. Generally speaking, a tensile mean stress will tend to decrease the fatigue life and a compressive mean stress will tend to increase the fatigue life.

There are two mean stress correction techniques that are used extensively in practice:

Morrow Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT)

Typically, the Morrow is used when the dominant mean stress within a stress history is compressive in nature. The E-N equation is modified as follows for the Morrow correction:

(6.2.16) where

Oo

The SWT correction is used when the dominant mean stress in within a stress history is tensile in nature. The E-N equation is modified as follows for the SWT correction:

(6.2.17)

-46-

6.3

Notch Correction For E-N analysis, Neuber's rule is typically used to correct for notches or other geometric features that cause stress concentrations (Kt). Neuber's rule states that the theoretical stress concentration is the geometric mean stress and strain concentration of the square root of the product Ka and KÂ£. The equations for Neuber's rule are:

(6.3.1) (6.3.2) (6.3.3)

S =nominal stress e = nominal strain

a = notch stress
Â£=notch strain

The nominal stress and strain can be related using Hooke's Law to simplify the equation as follows:

K 2 =acE

s s

(6.3.4)

The monotonic stress-strain equation can now be substituted into the Neuber correction:

(6.3.5)

In the same manner, the cyclic stress-strain curve can be substituted into the Neuber correction:

(6.3.6)

Therefore, for components that are analyzed with stress concentrations, Neuber rule is used to predict the actual stress levels at the concentration, not the linear-elastic prediction based on KtS.

6.4

Random Loading History
In general, landing gear components are subjected to random loading histories. As a result, a method must be used to determine the appropriate stress pairs. At the present, it is standard industry practice to use the rainflow method.

The rainflow method attempts to identify closed hysteresis loops in the stress-strain response of a meterial subjected to cyclic loading. The first step in rainflow counting is to draw the stress-strain history so that the time axis is vertical with increasing time downward. The strain history is then imagined as a series of "pagoda roofs." Cycles are then identified by the manner in which rain is allowed to drip of fall down the roofs. A number of rules have been established to identify closed hysteresis loops and are provided below:

z.

1. To eliminate the counting of half cycles, 1he strain-time history is drawn so as to begin and end at the strain value of greatest magnitude. A ftow of rain is begun at each strain reversal in the history and is allowed to continue to flow unless; a. The rain began at a local maximum point (peak) and falls opposite a local maximum point greater than that from which it came . b. The rain began at a local minimum point (valley) and falls opposite a local minimum point greater (in magnitude=) than thal rrom which it came. ~. It encounters a previous rainflow.

A sample rainflow count example is provided below along with the resulting hysteresis loop:

Miner's Rule
The damage fraction, D, is defined as the fraction of life used up by an event or series of events. Miner's Rule states that, when the summation of damages reaches a value of 1.0, the component has used up its life and crack initiation will begin.

In mathematical terms, Miner's Rule can be equated as follows:

L:D21

(6.5.1)

In the aerospace industry, Miner's rule is used extensively to predict the onset of crack initiation. All fatigue damage/life predictions provided by the software presented in section 8.5 is based on Miner's rule.

Chapter 7: Load Prediction Algorithm Development

Load prediction algorithms have been developed for two potential load monitoring locations:

Â· Â·

Axle Root Post

7.1

Axle Equations

This section outlines the governing equations for predicting ground loads acting on landing gear by placing uniaxial strain gauges on the landing gear axles.

In order to predict the ground loads acting on a landing gear, the ideal strain gauge installation locations are at the axles. The axle root is the theoretically most ideal location for strain gauge placement because it is directly adjacent to the load application point (i.e. the wheel and tire).

The strain gauges must be placed on the interior surface of the axles in order to protect the gauges from runway debris and harsh environments. Landing gear axles are exposed to four main types of stress:

Â· Â· Â· Â·

Bending Axial Shear Hoop

The bending, axial, and shear stresses are a direct result of the loads being applied to the landing gear via the landing gear tires. The hoop stresses acting on an axle are due to the contact between the wheel bearing and the axle and the mating part with the axle (typically a piston or bogie beam). This contact produces a compressive hoop pressure on the axle which, in turn, causes hoop stress in the axles. Any strain measurements that are taken at the axle must take this hoop stress into account in order to correctly predict the loads being applied to the landing gear.

In the total axial strain equation above, there are a total of 6 unknowns, therefore six strain gauges are needed to solve for all of the variables. The hoop stress is also an unknown in the equation, but the values of the expected hoop stress at each strain gauge can be determined by relating the applied loads to hoop stress via FEA.

A finite element model of the axle/bogie beam or axle/piston interface with contact can relate the hoop stress levels to the applied load. This analysis is completed in two steps:

Â· Â·

Apply combinations of vertical and drag ground loads to the model Apply combinations of MD and MV moments to the model

Using the principal of superposition (see section 4.2), the total axial strain can be related as follows:

(]'X

In fact, with the use of FEA, there is no need to derive the stress equations based on applied loads and moments. Instead, the FEA results can be used directly.

On the the following pages, I summarize an FEA analysis of the A380-800 PAX WLG Axle that I have completed based on available CATIA models provided by GLG. Various combinations of the following loads were applied to the landing gear:

Newton's Method for Solving Nonlinear Systems of Equations

In order to solve for a nonlinear equation with one variable, the Newton-Rhapson technique is often employed to determine the roots of the equation. The general form of the Newton-Rhapson equation is as follows:

g (X) =
where

(7.2.9)

Â¢( x)

is the inverse of the derivative of f(x) (i.e. 1/f').

A similar approach can be used in the n-dimension case which involves the matrix

all(x) al2(x) A(x)= a2l(x) a22(x) anl(x) an2(x)
where each of the entires aii(x) is a function from Rn into A-Space. This requires that A(x) be found so that (7.2.1 0)

The inverse of the J-Matrix can be solved by using Gaussian elimination techniques. Once the JMatrix is solved, iterative techniques via computer code can be used to determine the roots of the nonlinear system of equations.

Once RF, RM,

Thus, Newtons method involves a linearization of the nonlinear system of equations. To assure convergence, it requires an initial guess which is close enough to the desired solution, and a step size which is small enough. For landing gear applications, it may be sufficient to assume an initial value of applied vertical force since this force is always present when the aircraft is on the ground.

1.3

Post Equations Another more simplified means of measuring the ground loads applied to the landing gear structure is to measure the strain levels at the piston and torque links. In general, all applied loads acting at the wheels will be transferred to the remaining landing gear structure via the piston and torque links. By placing strain gauges at these two strategic locations, the post loads applied to the landing gear can be measured.

The post is defined as the equivalent single ground reaction point for the entire landing gear. This point is typically defined as the intersection point between the axle and shock strut centrelines. In total, there can be six components of post loads:

D = Drag force (fore/aft acting load) S =Side force (Inboard/Outboard acting load) V =Vertical force (Upward acting load) MD = Moment acting about the fore/aft axis MS = Moment acting about the inboard/outboard axis (due to brake torque) MV = Moment acting about the vertical axis

Note: this table assumes that the landing gear has no rake angle or that the vertical load axis is parallel with the shock strut axis

Table 7-1 indicates that all five components of load will generate an axial strain at the piston location chosen (either through bending or direct axial loading). As a result, it is theoretically possible to predict these five components of post loads by strategically placing five uniaxial strain gauges at this location (see below).

Any moment acting about the shock strut axis (MV) is transferred to the outer cylinder (and, consequently, the airframe) via the torque links. The torque links react this moment in shear. This shear load produces high bending loads on the torque links (see below).

Note that, for some landing gear designs, the oil in the shock strut is throughout the entire length of the piston barrel. If there is oil present at the region where the strain gauges are placed on the barrel, hoop stresses will be present. Due to Hooke's Law, this hoop stress will affect the strain uniaxial strain gauge readings. As a result, an additional strain gauge will be required to monitor the hoop stress at the strain gauge locations. If this stress can be determined, the uniaxial strain gauges can be corrected for the hoop stress.

In the total axial strain equation above, there are a total of 5 unknowns, therefore five strain gauges are needed to solve for all of the variables. An additional unknown could be the hoop stress if the shock strut design is such that there is internal pressure at the strain gauge measurement locations. If internal pressure is present, then an additional strain gauge is required to account for x-component of strain caused by the hoop stress

Using the principal of superposition (see section 4.2), the total axial strain can be related as follows:

a x = a x(D,S)+ a x(MD,MS)+ a x(V)

a .r = a .r (v)
&x =

~(a, - va, )= ~ [(a,(D,S)+ a,(MD,MS)+ a,(v))- va,(v)]

In fact, with the use of FEA, there is no need to derive the stress equations based on applied loads and moments. Instead, the FEA results can be used directly.

As part of the technology demonstration plan for the proposed ODHMS system, the post strain gauge configuration (see section 7.3) will be placed on the G650 NLG static, fatigue, and drop test units. In all cases, the test unit is a fully assembled landing gear that is very similar to the landing gear that will be in used on in-service aircraft.

Since the finite element model is 30 in nature, it is necessary to skin the outer surface of the the model with 20 elements in the two regions where the strain gauges will be placed. Since strain gauges are only capable of measuring planar strain levels, the stress data extracted from the finite element model must be planar as well. By placing 20 membrane elements on the surface of the model, the finite element model is able to output the planar stress levels. See below for a plot of the 20 elements used in the model:

As a result of this series of linear equations, the amount of calibration required for this type of strain gauge layout is quite limited. In essence, only 5 load cases may need to be applied to the static test unit to create the strain gauge coefficient matrix A.

It should be noted that the equations derived above assumed that there is no internal pressure at the strain gauge locations on the piston barrel. In reality, there will be internal hoop pressure applied at the strain gauge locations. For the final configuration, an additional strain gauge will be required to measure the strain due to hoop stress. Therefore, the strain gauge readings at the four other locations can be corrected for the hoop stress component.

-89-

7.5

Strain Gauge Data Acquisition The equations derived in sections 7.1 and 7.3 are independent of the type of strain gauge chosen for the ODHMS system. The equations only require the strain levels to be output from the strain gauge data acquisition system. For further discussion on the sensing system options, refer to section 3.1 .

7.6

Sensitivity to Temperature It will be necessary for the strain monitoring system to correct for temperature. In general, landing gear design requires that the landing gear be able to function between temperatures of -45Â°C to 70Â°C. However, in components that are close to the brakes, the temperature requirements may be increased to values of 300Â°C. Generally speaking, the regions that the strain gauges will be placed on the piston and torque links will not be exposed to the maximum brake temperatures. However, the temperature exposure may be higher than 70Â°C.

7. 7

Strain Gauge Time-Lag
It may be possible that one or more strain gauges may have time lag in reading and outputting data. In other words, it may be possible that one or more strain gauges may not be in the same time sequence as the overall system. As a result of this potential time-lag, it is necessary to investigate the system's sensitivity to time-lag. In this section, the following assumptions are made:

Data Reduction for Static and Fatigue Analysis
In order to speed up the static and fatigue analysis of the SHM system, the raw strain data will need to be processed and reduced to manageable levels. The data reduction method will attempt to identify two types of data to be eliminated from the analysis:

Â· Â·

data points between peaks and valleys of load eliminated small strain-level vibrations eliminated

7.9.1

Intermediate Data Point Elimination
In landing gear structure, applied loads take variable amounts of time to reach their maximum magnitudes. For instance, a ground maneuver may take seconds to generate full load levels whereas a landing case may take milliseconds. As a result, the SHM system must be designed to detect the maximum and minimum ground loads for both types of loading states. This requirement will result in large amounts of strain data that is not useful in the analysis since this data will lie between the maximum and minimum load levels (i.e. peaks and valleys).

An example of intermediate data point elimination is provided below:

An algorithm will be developed to eliminate these intermediate strain levels. Since the SHM system will require a minimum of 6 strain gauges, the algorithm developed may be quite complex. Initially, the data elimination algorithm will take the absolute strain at each strain gauge and calculate the sum of these strains at each time slice:

ILcrl =Lie; I
i= l

(7.9.1)

where:

absolute total strain of all strain gauges for a given time slice absolute strain for a given strain gauge

Small-Strain Vibration Elimination
During take-off, landing, and taxiing, landing gear systems undergo large amounts of low-level vibration loading. Typically, these load levels do not affect the structural strength or the fatigue life of landing gear components. As a result, these types of loading events can be removed by the SHM system prior to completing static and fatigue analysis on the landing gear. An example of small vibration strain elimination is provided below:

However, for example, assume that the not to exceed strain level (NES) has been set to Â£Nrs- The resulting algorithm is as follows:

Lug (cont'd)

For fatigue analysis of lugs, in many cases there are two dominant loading directions acting on the lug (Piug1, Plug2). To account for these two cases, the following algorithm is used for determining the equivalent stress, feq:

Plug1

feq

= K1 Plug1 feq = K2 Plug2

(for 81 :5 9 :5 82) (for 9 :5 81 and 92 :5 9)

In other instances, the lug load is bidirectional (i.e. Plug1 is positive or negative). For this scenario, the following algorithm is used:

feq = K1 Plug feq

(for Plug

0)

= K2 Plug

(for Plug < 0)

FEM Nodal Stress Analysis

For complex landing gear components, it is sometimes difficult to use traditional section cut analysis to predict the stress levels within the component. As a result, FEA is used extensively for these components as a reliable alternative to section cut analysis. In order to use FEA for predicting stress levels for complex loading scenarios, the principle of superposition is used (see section 4.2). Generally speaking, a series of unit load cases are individually analyzed on a component to determine the unit stress levels within the component. For example:

p

~
M

p

M FIGURE 8-2: SAMPLE USE OF FEA RESULTS

Assume that, at point A, the following unit 20 stresses result from the applied shear and moments:

Load Case Shear, P Moment, M

Ox

Oy

Txy

5.0 1.0

0.0 0.0

1.0 0.0

Now, assume that a 10 kip force P and a 100 kip-in moment M are applied to the cantilever beam. The total stress components acting at point are then:

Ox=

10 (5.0) + 100(1.0)

oy = 0.0 ksi

ODHMS Strain Interpreter 1.0
At the time of publication, the software for ODHMS Strain Interpreter 1.0 is still in development.

This software will read the raw strain data collected by the ODHMS system on the landing gear. The purpose of this software is twofold:

1. 2.

Eliminate superfluous strain data from strain history Calculate the wheel or post loads

8.3.1

Elimination of Superfluous Strain Data
Eliminating the superfluous strain data from the strain history file will be the first step in the software program. By eliminating unneeded strain data, the overall speed of the ODHMS software will be greatly improved. Two separate algorithms will be used to eliminate the superfluous data:

1. 2.

Intermediate Data Point Elimination (see section 7.9.1) Small-Strain Vibration Elimination (see section 7.9.2)

8.3.2

Calculation of Wheel/Post Loads
Once all of the superfluous strain data has been eliminated from the ODHMS strain history output, the software will determine the wheel or post loads, depending on the ODHMS system specified. If the system chosen measures wheel loads at the axle (see section 7.1 ), then a combination of Newton's Method of Solving Nonlinear systems of equations and Gaussian elimination will be used (see section 7.2.5). If the system will measure post loads (see section 7.3), then a linear system of equations will be solved using Gaussian elimination (see section 7.4.3).

ODHMS Overload Prediction 1.0
At the time of publication, the software for ODHMS Overload Prediction 1.0 is still in development.

This software will utilize the section definitions created by ODHMS Section Definition 1.0 (see section 8.2) and the wheel/post loads predicted using ODHMS Strain Interpreter 1.0 (see section 8.3). For these two inputs to be linked properly, a series of unit loads will need to be applied to the landing gear structural beam model (see section 0) . As an example, assume that the ODHMS system used predicts post loads. The following unit loads would need to be applied to the beam model for a MLG:

For each unit load case, 6 components of internal loads will result at each beam element. Assuming the principle of superposition (see section 4.2), the unit internal loads results for each post load can be directly combined. As an example, assume that it is required to calculate the axial force acting at member 100, joint 100 for the following post loads:

Paxial = -Fx [M1 OOJ1 00] D = 5 kips S = 5 kips

= 30 kips MD = 100 kips-in MS = 50 kips-in MV = 25 kips

Once the unit load results have been combined with the load equations (as shown above), each post load data point will be converted into applied section loads at each section cut analysis location. Based on the cross-section geometry, a yield margin of safety will be calculated and recorded (see section 4.3 for a sample section cut margin calculation). The user will also have the option of calculated the ultimate margin of safety.

ODHMS Life Prediction 1.0 At the time of publication, the software for ODHMS Life Prediction 1.0 is still in development.

Generally speaking, this software utilizes the same techniques to calculate applied loads/stresses as is employed in section 8.4. Instead of calculating margins of safety after stress levels are calculated, the equivalent stress is stored for each load history data point. After stress levels have been calculated for every load history data point, rainflow analysis is completed on the stress history (see section 6.4 for details on rainflow) to determine the stress pairs for fatigue damage assessment. After all of the relevant stress pairs have been identified by the rainflow procedure, strain-life analysis is utilized to predict the accumulated fatigue damage on the sections analyzed. For details on strain-life theory, refer to section 6.2.

Cantilever Beam Demonstration Test As an initial development exercise, a cantilever beam test will be completed. This cantilever beam test will attempt to simulate the applied loads from a wheel to a landing gear axle. In this test, a series of unit load cases will first be applied to calibrate the strain gauges. After calibration is complete, combinations of the unit cases will be applied to confirm the validity of both the calibration and the load equations developed in sections 7.1 and 7.3. A diagram of the test fixture that I have designed is provided below:

For the side load case, both side load and MD moment will be applied. As a result, it is necessary to apply a constant side load at various distances from the axle centreline in order to separate the effects of side load and MD moment.

FIGURE 9-3: STRAIN GAUGE PLACEMENT ON CANTILEVER BEAM

For the demonstration test, 3 sets of 4 strain gauge rosettes will be place on the axle at the locations specified in the figure above. Strain gauge rosettes will be used as a means for confirming the results of the uniaxial strain gauge concept predictions. When rosettes are used, shear, bending, and axial loads can be measured more directly than the uniaxial strain gauge concept proposed for the test.

Three separate locations have been chosen in order to investigate the sensitivity of the strain gauge readings to the magnitude of bending moment.

Test Cases

In order to test the fidelity of the load equations developed for the cantilever beam test, a series of typical in-service landing gear loads were used. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in combination with a VBA macro was utilized to test the load equations. The steps to confirm the fidelity of the load equations are as follows:

1.

Based on the applied loads to the cantilever beam, calculate the strain levels based on the strain equations and appropriate coefficients derived in the previous section

2. 3.

Input the strain levels calculated from step 1 for a given load case Use Newton's method to solve for the appropriate ground loads to match the inputted strain levels

4.

Compare the known applied loads to the predicted strain levels using Newtons Method

G650 NLG Drop Test
For each new landing gear design, a series of drop tests are required to certify the performance of the landing gear shock strut. These tests require that the landing gear be dropped at specific sink and tire rotation speeds. Drop tests are the best means of testing dynamic loading scenarios prior to flight test.

As a technology demonstration test, the post-style strain gauge configuration proposed in this thesis (see section 7.3) will be place on the G650 NLG drop test unit. This test will investigate the strain gauge configuration's ability to measure strain levels during highly dynamic loading events. Based on the strain levels measured, the resulting ground loads will be calculated and compared to the dynamic simulation results.

9.3

G650 NLG Static Test
Many loading events experienced by landing gear are quasi-static in nature. These loading events include turning, braking, taxiing, etc. As a result, it will be necessary to demonstrate that the proposed load monitoring system is able to predict these types of loading events.

As a part of the technology demonstration, the strain gauge configuration proposed in section 7.3 will be placed on the G650 NLG static test unit. This test will demonstrate the proposed strain gauge configuration's ability to predict the applied loads for quasi-static load events.

9.4

G650 NLG Fatigue Test
In conjunction with the static and drop test technology demonstrations, the proposed strain gauge configuration will also be placed on the G650 NLG fatigue test unit. The purpose of this demonstration is twofold:

1.

fidelity of post load predictions under cyclic loading (most representative of in-service loading)

2.

ability of system to maintain ability to accurately measure strains over long periods of time under cyclic loading

G650 Flight Test
As a final step in the technology demonstration of the ODHMS system, the proposed strain gauge configuration will be placed on the G650 flight test aircraft (shown below).

TABLE 9-2: GULFSTREAM G650 BUSINESS JET

Assuming that the drop, static, and fatigue demonstration tests are successful, the proposed system will be placed on the G650 flight test aircraft to demonstrate the system's ability for actual in-service measurements.

Chapter 10: Discussion

In future aircraft platforms, there is an opportunity to provide both airframe manufacturers and airline customers a sensing system for landing gear overload detection and long-term health monitoring. I have named this system as 'Overload Detection and Health Monitoring System' (ODHMS). At present, there are many innovative sensing system options that could be used in an ODHMS system. This system would utilize either direct or indirect measurement of strain at key locations on the landing gear structure. A few of these sensing options include fibre optic strain gauges and silicon MEMS strain gauges developed by Goodrich Corporation.

The keys to developing an ODHMS system that both airline customers and airframe manufacturers will allow to be placed on the landing gear are:

Â· Â· Â· Â·

Minimize the number of sensors required to predict overload and fatigue life Minimize the need for replacement and/or maintenance of sensing system Minimize the weight and power consumption of the system Minimize complexity of system which reduces the probability of system failure

For an ODHMS system to be viable, there are two options:

1. 2.

Place sensors on key structural components of landing gear Place sensors at a few key locations to predict ground loads

Option 1 would involve a high number of sensors. As an example, if resistance strain gauges were chosen as the sensor, a minimum of 100 channels would be required to accurately predict the loads acting on all key structural components on the landing gear. Placing this many sensors on the landing gear system pose many issues:

Â·

Many cables required to connect all strain gauges to data acquisition system (DAC). This many cables may not be physically possible since the landing gear will need to retract and extend (i.e. cables may not bend or could interfere with retraction sequence)

Â·

Weight of all of the cables and the increased power requirements for system could be prohibitive - 140-

Â·

Introduction of high sensor count increases risk of maintenance/replacement as well as system failure

Option 2 is a much more viable option and is the focus of my thesis. By placing a minimum amount of sensors close to the ground loads application points (i.e. wheels), the input forces and moments acting on the landing gear can be measured. With the use of standard landing gear structural beam models, the internal loads throughout the structure can be predicted analytically instead of by direct measurement. These structural beam models are validated during prototype landing gear testing therefore the accuracy of the internal load predictions will be acceptable. In my proposal, I investigate two different sensor configurations:

1. 2.

Wheel Load Sensing Post Load Sensing

Wheel load sensing (see section 7.1) is the most accurate way of determining the applied ground loads to the landing gear since the sensors will be measuring directly adjacent to the wheel. By measuring at the wheel, the distribution of forces and moments at each wheel can be accurately determined. However, there are some difficulties of implementing this type of sensing system:

1.

Sensors will need to be placed on the inner diameter (10) of the axle. For smaller landing gears (i.e. less than 150 passengers), the ID's are relatively small and installing the sensors here would require special tooling.

2.

Since the brakes typically rest on the axle, the sensors would be exposed to high temperatures (in the range of 250 Â°C maximum). If standard bonding techniques are utilized to attach the sensors to the axle, these bonds may not withstand the temperature. Special bonding agents may need to be utilized to withstand the high temperature exposure.

3.

The moment due to braking would not be measured at the wheel. Instead, it would be the brake supplier's responsibility to provide brake torque data to the ODHMS system.

Post load sensing (see section 7.3) requires that sensors be placed on the outer diameter of the piston and on the lower (or upper) torque link. This system is capable of measuring the total forces and moments acting on the landing gear but cannot accurately predict the loads acting at each individual wheel. Therefore, for any wheel and axle analyses, assumptions about the distribution the total load at each wheel will need to be made (aviation authorities typically require that a minimum of 60% distribution at each will be assumed). This system requires only five (for NLG) and six (for MLG) sensors to predict the post loads acting on the landing gear.

- 141 -

Comparing the two systems, the post load measurement technique is best for smaller landing gears that have one or two wheels. The assumptions made in terms of wheel load distributions are minimized since there are a maximum of two wheels to consider. For larger aircraft with landing gears that have 4 or more wheels, the wheel load monitoring system is ideal since the need to make assumptions about wheel load distributions is eliminated.

The two sensing system configurations that I have proposed require that the sensors output strain levels. The sensors chosen must be capable of accurately sensing strain (direct of indirect) for dynamic, quasi-static, and static loading events. The sensing system must be capable of accurately reading strain levels in dynamic loading events at ranges of 256 - 1000 Hz. Technologies today can provide this type of accuracy for dynamic loading events. During flight test programs for prototype aircraft, the airframe manufacturer typically requires that the landing gear manufacturer calibrate their landing gear designs with resistance strain gauges. The strain data collected by these strain gauges includes all regimes of flight (dynamic, quasi-static, and static). The strain data accumulated during flight test is then used to validate both aircraft dynamic and structural models used to predict ground loads.

- 142-

Chapter 11: Conclusion

In future aircraft landing gear development programs, an opportunity exists for landing gear suppliers such as GLG to provide customers with both an overload detection and health monitoring system. If companies such as GLG can provide a low cost, low-maintenance system to detect the health of their landing gear products, both airframe manufacturers and airline customers will be willing to absorb additional up-front costs to purchase the system. In the long-term, the airline customers will save costs since inspections for both overload and fatigue may be reduced and/or eliminated.

This thesis has proposed a system strain gauge configuration that could accurately measure the ground loads experienced by a landing gear over its life. This configuration is independent of the choice of strain measurement type so that, over time, improved measurement techniques may be implemented with little to no impact to the algorithms presented in this report.

The proposed strain gauge configuration will be demonstrated in a series of tests of escalating complexity which are listed below:

1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

Cantilever Beam Test G650 NLG Static Test G650 NLG Drop Test G650 NLG Fatigue Test G650 NLG Flight Test

If these technology demonstration tests are successful, both in-service and future aircraft platforms will be able to place a system similar to ODHMS on their landing gear systems. This system will be able to predict overload, service-life, and aircraft weights and balance.
