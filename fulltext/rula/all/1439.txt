ABSTRACT Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very important tool for planning and analysis of power systems. In the recent times, uncertain renewable energy is being integrated into power systems in a large scale. Appropriate modeling of renewables in optimal power flow requires using stochastic models. Using stochastic models of renewables in optimal power flow is numerically and algorithmically challenging due to the complexity of stochastic models and nonlinear nature of bus power balance equations. Hitherto, Monte Carlo simulation technique and Cumulant technique have been proposed, but they are not computationally viable for large systems. In this thesis, we propose the use of linear fuzzy relation technique to relate stochastic models of dependent variables of optimal power flow formulation in terms of control variables that include power output of renewables. This fuzzy relation uses Hessian matrix of the LaGrangian of the optimal power flow formulation at optimal solution point. The technique is tested on a six bus system and results are reported. One can intuitively see that this technique can be easily extended to larger systems.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Electrical Power System Electrical power system is one of the largest and most complex systems in the world having its distinctive properties based on its geographical layout. It consists of three principal components namely generation, transmission and distribution. It is undergoing rapid changes since the last two decades with the integration of renewables. The power system should operate at optimal state at all times. To achieve this goal, optimal power flow in various forms is used by the system operator multiple times a day for realistic power system network conditions [1]. In the past two decades, world is increasing moving ahead towards clean energy generation technology as source of power generation. The wind energy generation among other renewable sources such as solar, geothermal, bioenergy, small hydro etc. is increasing at a rapid pace due to increase in electricity demand, environmental issues such as global warming, advancements in renewable technologies etc. The year 2010 marked an important milestone in the global wind energy industry as it was the first year that more new wind capacity was added in emerging markets than in traditional Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. In order to harness maximum green energy there is an increase in wind generation connected into the power system. Today, the total renewable generation in the world is more than 40 GW as reported by 2011 Global Wind Energy Council, Figure 1.1 [2].

With power output from wind electric generator being uncertain, their inclusion in optimal power flow renders the optimal solution with uncertainties. Therefore one must quantify and comprehend uncertainties in wind energy and the resulting optimal solution of optimal power flow. This task requires a probabilistic optimization technique in order to determine optimal solution values of different variables. With connection of wind electric generators in an electrical network, even with the most accurate wind forecasting techniques the prediction of wind at a particular instant of time is uncertain and so do output of wind electric generators [3]. This uncertainty is addressed by a probabilistic technique using probability density function of normal distribution representing output of wind electric generator [4]. It takes into account all possible uncertainties associated with wind electric generator power output.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Owing to the reason that power output of wind electric generator can deviate from their mean value, such deviation should be considered in finding the optimal voltage solution for the real power optimal power flow problem. As this deviation is represented by a normal probability density function, hence the voltage solution at a bus is not a deterministic value, but voltage value depends on deviation of power output of wind electric generator from its mean value. During the normal operation of a power system, voltage values at all buses in the network should be within limits of as set by regulatory authorities. So it becomes

important to study the effect of a wind electric generator on the voltage at buses in the network.

It is a challenge to find the voltage solution to this problem. In this work, a probabilistic optimal real power flow technique is proposed that takes into account the probabilistic nature of the wind power output while determining the optimal voltage solution at buses of a transmission system as shown in Figure 1.2.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Owing to probabilistic power output of wind electric generator in the electrical network, different techniques are used to find solution for optimal power flow problem. One traditional technique which is used to deal with such probabilistic problems is Monte Carlo simulation technique which finds solution for deviation of wind electric generator power output. It runs simulations, one by one for every deviation of wind power from the mean forecasted value, by solving a deterministic optimal power flow formulation and hence takes a lot of time to find the probabilistic solution. The situation gets even worse when the number of wind electric generators connected to the network is increased. In order to reduce solution time in solving probabilistic optimal power flow problem, the authors in one paper proposed real power optimal power flow using cumulant technique in which, the cumulants for unknown random variables are computed from known random variables, and probability density functions are reconstructed as bus loading is treated as random variables [5]. In another paper, system demand is taken as a random vector of correlated variables and FirstOrder Second Moment technique is used to find their statistical characteristics [6]. In another technique load demand and wind availability are taken as random variables and cumulants for output variables is calculated. Finally, probability density function of output variables is reconstructed by Gram-Charlier expansion theory [7]. The main idea behind all these techniques is to use approximate formulas for calculating the statistical moments of a random quantity that is a function of random variables.

This thesis briefly outlines the fundamentals of the Lagrangian technique, in which Kraush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are solved using a Newton Raphson technique and its adaptation to solve real power optimal power flow problem to compute voltages in fuzzy

1.2 Objective of this Thesis
In this thesis, we propose fuzzy relation technique to relate stochastic models of dependent variables of optimal power flow formulation in terms of control variables that include power output of renewables. This fuzzy relation uses the Hessian matrix of the LaGrangian of the optimal power flow formulation at optimal solution point. The stochastic models determined by the proposed technique are compared with those obtained from traditional accurate but time consuming Monte-Carlo simulation technique. The technique is tested on a six bus system and results are reported. One can intuitively see that this technique can be easily extended to larger systems.

1.3 Thesis Outline

In Chapter 3 the general mathematical Lagrangian model, its deterministic solution and probabilistic optimal power flow using linear fuzzy relation technique are presented. Chapter 4 details results of a modified Ward and Hale six-bus system obtained using the proposed technique and its comparison with Monte Carlo simulation technique. Finally Chapter 5 concludes the thesis stating its advantages. Appendix A is provided at the end in order to present data of the modified Ward and Hale system.

Chapter 2 Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow Â­ Problem formulation

This chapter presents wind generator model and then formulates the probabilistic optimal power flow formulation. The model uses the probability theory in which a random variable is used to reflect the behavior of random processes. So uncertainty in the power output of wind electric generator is represented by a probability density function of a normal random variable. Once it is represented by probability density function it is used in problem formulation to find probabilistic characteristics of unknown variables.

2.1 Modeling of Wind Generator Output The power output of wind electric generator at bus i is modeled by a normal distribution with its respective mean ( )and standard deviation ( value. In order to include the

majority of deviation in wind electric generator power output from its mean value, a 99.73% confidence interval is taken which is equal to  shown in Figure 2.1 [4]. of mean value power output as

Bus i has a wind electric generator connected to it that injects real power. The net real power demand at the bus is represented by and it is the difference between

the real power demand and real output power of wind electric generator at the bus. This is used to represent net power demand at the bus and is used in real power optimal power flow formulation. In the probabilistic real power optimal power flow study, the objective is to minimize the total active power generation cost:  where generation. subject to: Bus Power Balance Equality constraints: In real power probabilistic optimal power flow, the cost of generation is minimized while satisfying these equality constraints imposed by physical nature of the system. These are the cost coefficients of generator and (2.2) is the real power

Inequality constraints at load buses: These constraints are included to ensure that the optimal solution is free from voltage violations at load buses (2.8) where are the lower and upper limits of voltages at load buses. The above is a probabilistic real power optimal power flow formulation with PWi being the probabilistic input. As a result, the solution comprising of power generated by generators (PG) and voltage at load buses (V) are probabilistic. Equations (2.2) to (2.8) construe the complete problem.

2.3 Conclusion This chapter presented a probabilistic real power optimal power flow challenge. Firstly probabilistic model of the wind electric generator is basically represented by probability density function of normal distribution which takes into account maximum deviation of power output from the forecasted mean value. The values from probability density function representing uncertainty is included in the problem formulated which is basically minimizing cost of all conventional electric generators subject to various constraints in regard to find optimal probabilistic solution of unknown system variables. The proposed solution technique will be presented in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 3 PROBABILISTIC OPTIMAL POWER FLOW Â­ SOLUTION

The solution strategy for the probabilistic real power optimal power flow problem is detailed in this section. The goal of this solution technique is to determine the probabilistic behavior of the dependent variables which can be observed by their probabilistic distribution function values. Hence the first step is to formulate the deterministic real power optimal power flow problem. To solve the deterministic formulation, the Lagrangian formulation is used and is solved by satisfying the Kraush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. On obtaining the optimal solution for the deterministic real power optimal power flow problem, a Hessian matrix is determined that relates changes in problem variables at the optimal point. Thereafter, probabilistic variable are transformed to fuzzy variables using fuzzy triangles. Finally probabilistic behavior of real power and voltage variables is calculated using linear fuzzy relation and a Hessian matrix estimated at optimal point. The set of steps of the linear fuzzy relation based probabilistic optimal power flow technique are summarized below:

1.

The probabilistic real power optimal power flow challenge is reduced to a deterministic challenge by considering the mean value of power output of wind generator ( i).

2.

The deterministic formulation is solved by forming a Lagrangian function and solving Kraush-Kuhn-Tucker Conditions.

11

Chapter 3: Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow Solution

3.

The Hessian of the Lagrangian at the optimal solution is reduced to form a linear relation between changes in wind power output (PWi) and other optimal variables such as generator real power output (PG), bus voltage (V), etc.

4.

Fuzzy probabilistic variables are defined that represent approximations of probabilistic distribution functions of wind power output (  i).

5.

Linear Fuzzy Relation technique is used to determine fuzzy probabilistic variables of power output of conventional electric generator power (PG) and voltage at buses (V) in terms of fuzzy probabilistic variable of wind power output . Accordingly,

mean and standard deviation of probability density functions for PG and V are estimated.

These steps are now detailed in the following sections.

3.1

Deterministic Optimal Power Flow (with mean value of WEG power output i)

The step of finding the deterministic optimal power flow solution is to form a Lagrangian function of the problem by augmenting objective function with active & reactive power balance equations and other inequality constraints. In optimal power flow problem formulation there are basically three types of variables: independent, dependent and Lagrange multipliers. Independent variables are generator real powers outputs, generators terminal voltages, transformers tap ratios etc. which can be controlled to obtain optimal solution, dependent variables corresponds to both magnitude and angle of voltages at load

12

Chapter 3: Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow Solution

buses, reactive power output of generators and Lagrange multipliers that are coefficients corresponding to real and reactive power balance equations at buses.

The values of the unknowns and Lagrange multipliers corresponding to optimal power flow problem are determined from the Lagrangian formulation of the problem. In every step of the iterative algorithm, values of variables and Lagrange multipliers are computed simultaneously. At the optimal state, change in variables is less than the defined tolerance value.

The Lagrange multiplier technique augments the original objective function with a set of the equality constraints and inequality constraints. The problem defined in section (2.2) Â­ (2.8) may be stated briefly as: (3.1)

(3.2) (3.3) A Lagrangian function for (3.1) Â­ (3.3) may be defined as below: [ ] [ ] (3.4)

Once the probabilistic optimal power flow problem is formulated, an algorithm is developed to minimize the cost of conventional electric generators including resultant demand at a wind electric generator bus in power system network to meet overall load demand of the network. The basic idea is to determine the optimum values of the variables

13

Chapter 3: Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow Solution

such that value of cost function is the minimum. To solve this problem by deriving the Kraush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions as below, one gets: (3.5) (3.6) (3.7) (3.8) By solving the above, we can determine the optimal values for X,  and  At the optimal solution, on identify binding inequality constraints , one gets:

 (3.10) (3.11) Using first order approximation, one may write:

where H(X) is the Hessian of the Lagrangian. is the gradient of the Lagrangian. is the value for change in variable at every iteration.

where HPW is an extract of the Hessian matrix from (3.12). The procedure to obtain optimal solution uses the Newton Raphson technique. The Newton Raphson technique is basically solving simultaneously equations from (3.9) Â­ (3.11) for unknown variables at each iteration till the solution converges to the optimal solution. In order to solve using Newton Raphson technique, it is required to calculate elements of Jacobian matrix of (3.9) to (3.11).

3.2 Fuzzy Probabilistic Relations [9] This section details the proposed solution scheme that uses (3.13) relating changes in wind power (PW) with changes in real power output of generators (PG) and changes in bus voltages (V) using Linear Fuzzy Relation technique. 3.2.1 Linear Fuzzy Relation Â­ Introduction Fuzziness describes the ambiguity and randomness in the occurrence of an event. Lofti Zadeh proposed the set membership idea to model vagueness, imprecision and lack of information when uncertainty occurs and formed fuzzy sets as the sets on the universe X which can accommodate degree of fuzziness. Fuzziness in a fuzzy set is characterized by its membership function. Membership functions are formed by assigning a specific membership value (degree of belongingness) to each of estimated value. Membership function for a set maps each element of the set to a membership value between 0 and 1. In this work triangular membership function is formed which is defined by its middle value and spread respectively. A generic fuzzy set may be defined as below:  { } (3.14)

The following equation defines a generic linear fuzzy relation:  In (3.15),     (3.15)  to the

are constants that relate fuzzy variables  

output variable  . Typically, knowing input and output fuzzy variables, one may determine the constants using regression analysis [8]

17

Chapter 3: Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow Solution

The next section defines probabilistic wind power output as a fuzzy variable. It then uses the linear relation in the optimal solution (3.13) and relates fuzzy variable of power output (  ) of wind electric generator to the fuzzy variables of power output of conventional electric generators (  ) and voltage ( ) at buses. These fuzzy variables then help determine probabilistic values of power output of conventional electric generators (PG) and voltages (V) at buses.

3.2.2 Defining Fuzzy Variables In this work, power output of wind generators is uncertain. Consider output of the wind

generator (PWi). Eq. (2.1) provides its forecast probabilistic distribution function. The mean for this PDF is  . The uncertainty of this PDF can then be modeled by  such that    . Accordingly,  is defined as a fuzzy variable using (2.1) while

CHAPTER 4 TEST CASE AND RESULTS
The diagram of the modified Ward and Hale 6-bus system is shown in Fig. 4.1. The system has two conventional electric generators (CEG1) and (CEG 2) connected at electrical buses 1001 and 2003. One wind electric generator (WEG1) is connected at bus 2003. The total numbers of loads connected to the system are three. It has five transmission lines and two transformers (T/F1) & (T/F2).

In order to contrast results from the proposed technique, results are elicited from Monte Carlo simulation technique applied to same data set using deterministic formulation (2.1-2.7) are detailed in the following sections. The effect of deviation in power output of wind electric generator is studied on power output of conventional generators and voltage at buses.

4.1 Comparison of results for power output for Linear Fuzzy Relation technique and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique First, results for deviation in power output of conventional electric generators due to deviation in wind electric generator power output are presented in Table 4.1& Table 4.2.

Results shown in Table 4.1 are calculated using Linear Fuzzy Relation technique and standard deviation values are calculated for deviation in power output of generator.

The results of standard deviation values for generator outputs (PG1 & PG2) for both Linear Fuzzy Relation & Monte Carlo Simulation techniques is small as shown in Table 4.1 & 4.2.

Chapter 4: Test Case and Results

4.2 Comparison of results for voltages at buses for LFR and MCS technique Similarly in order to find the effect of deviation in wind electric generator power output on voltage of buses excluding slack and generator buses, Linear Fuzzy Relation technique is used and results are shown in Table 4.4. The values for standard deviations are calculated.

Table 4.4 Calculation of standard deviation values of voltages using LFR technique  Minimum Probable Value 2003 Voltage 1004 2005 1006 0.916486 0.966280 0.972948 0.943970 Maximum Probable Value 0.926314 0.974920 0.977052 0.948230 0.001638 0.001440 0.000684 0.000710 Standard Deviation

Results are shown in Table 4.4 for maximum deviation in voltages from their mean values due to deviation in power output of wind electric generator. The standard deviation values of voltages calculated for every bus indicate that there is very small effect on voltages due to deviation in power output of wind.

Similarly results are calculated from Monte Carlo Simulation technique and are shown in Table 4.5. The results for standard deviation values of voltages is small which also interprets the same information. In order to check the accuracy of the results of Linear Fuzzy Relation technique with Monte Carlo Simulation technique in case of voltage values, % error are calculated and tabulated in Table 4.6. The value of % error is very small which shows that the Linear Fuzzy Relation technique is an accurate technique.

4.3 Comparison of time required to obtain solution for both techniques The advantage of Linear Fuzzy Relation technique over Monte Carlo Simulation technique is its quick time in solving the probabilistic real power optimal power flow problem. The time is calculated for both techniques and shown in Table 4.7. Table 4.7 Comparison of time required to solve real power Real Power optimal power flow Technique Linear Fuzzy Relation (LFR) technique Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique Execution time (Secs) 0.23 54.78

The real power optimal power flow problem is solved using the code written in Matlab software version 7.12.0.635 (R 2011 a). This comparison of results shows that time required to solve using Linear Fuzzy Relation technique is extremely less as compared to Monte Carlo Simulation technique.

Chapter 4: Test Case and Results

Hence the results shown in Tables 4.1 to 4.7 demonstrate that proposed Linear Fuzzy Relation technique is accurate, efficient and reliable technique to solve probabilistic real power optimal power flow problem. It accounts for the probabilistic information of uncertain wind generators.

Chapter 5: Conclusion

Chapter 5 Conclusion

This thesis proposes a probabilistic optimal power flow using linear fuzzy relation technique to find the deviation in the optimal bus voltage values and power output of generators due to uncertainty in power output of wind electric generator. The thesis models output of wind electric generators using a normal probabilistic distribution function. This model is transformed into a triangular fuzzy model which has an area equal to the normal probability distribution function. Thereafter, considering the mean forecast of wind power, the optimal solution is determined using a deterministic optimal power flow formulation. From the Lagrangian function, the hessian determined at the optimal solution is used to create the linear fuzzy relation. This relation relates the fuzzy variables of wind power deviation to fuzzy variables of power output of generators and bus voltage magnitudes. These fuzzy variables are translated into probabilistic variables by computing mean and standard deviation values. The computed deviation in voltages and power output of generators corresponding to uncertainties in WEG power output using the proposed technique is compared with those obtained using MCS technique. On comparison, the % error values of power output of conventional electric generators and voltage solution values of buses shows that the proposed solution technique is accurate. Further, the time taken by proposed technique is

Chapter 5: Conclusion

significantly less than Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The proposed method is shown to be computationally efficient, operationally flexible and numerically accurate.
