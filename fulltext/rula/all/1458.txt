INVESTIGATION OF LOAD DISTRIBUTION FACTORS FOR SIMPLY-SUPPORTED COMPOSITE MULTIPLE BOX GIRDER BRIDGES

ABSTRACT
Composite box-girder bridges are recently used in modern highway urban system because of their profitable and structural aptitude advantages. North Americans Codes of Practice specify empirical equations for girder moment and shear forces in such bridges in the form of live load distribution factors. These factors were proven to be conservative in some cases and underestimate the response in other cases. Therefore, an extensive parametric study, using the finite-element modeling, was conducted to examine the key parameters that influence the load distribution factors of such bridges. A total of 276 prototype bridges were analyzed to evaluate girder bending moment, shear force and deflection distribution factors for simply-supported composite multiple box-girder bridges when subjected to CHBDC truck loading. Design parameters considered in this study were bridges span length, numbers of design lanes, number of box girders and girder spacing. Based on the data generated from parametric study, sets of simple empirical expressions were developed for bending moment; shear force and deflection distribution factors for such bridges. A correlation between the finite-element results with CHBDC and AASHTO-LRFD empirical expressions showed the former are more reliable in structural design of composite box-girder bridges.

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION
1.1 General
Many engineers around the world attempted to develop modern and appropriate structural highways design to make destination accessible. The construction of recent highways systems generally impress designers to utilize reliable geometry, appropriate boundary condition and superlative type of connection between different materials used consequently since it can securely and efficiently transmit the loads imposed on it. Highway bridge designs should be designed based on applicable Standards such as the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2010) and AASHTO-LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO, 2010). The research focused on the structural analysis of simply-supported composite Concrete slab-oversteel box-girder bridges. Box-girder bridges can be constructed using (i) reinforced concrete boxgirders, (ii) steel box-girders with concrete deck slab or orthotope steel deck, or (iii) presetressed concrete box-girders. These bridge cross-section types are shown in Figure 1.1, while Figure 1.2 shows the basic cross-section configuration and symbols for the bridge under consideraition in this study. Box-girder bridges are considered better than steel I-girder bridges because of their light dead load, large flexural and torsional stiffness. In addition, steel boxes can carry the required utilities to give a better architectural view. Moreover, box-girder bridges are Proven of having better lateral load distribution among girder when compared to steel I-girder bridges of similar bridge span and width (Zhang and Lou, 2012). Box-girder cross-section shows a superior performance in Resistant torsion with insignificant torsional warping effects as compared to Igirder bridges (El-Tawil and Okeil, 2002). Figures 1.3 and 1.4 show views of two box-girder bridge and five box-girder bridge, respectively.

1.2 The Problem
The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC, 2010) and AASHTO-LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO, 2010) specify load distribution factor equations for the design of selected bridge configurations and recommend few analytical methods (such as grillage analogy, semi-continuum analysis method, folded plate and finite-element method) for analysis
1

of other bridge configurations not covered by the similfied design method of analysis. The literature review shows that AASHTO-LRFD load distribution factors are conservative for specific design parameters and geometries and underestimate the response in other cases (ElTawil and Okeil, 2002; Yousif and Hindi, 2006). Other investigation indicated that AASHTOLRFD significantly overestimate the load distribution factors compared to finite-elements analysis ( Yousif and Hindi, 2007). Other studies showed that CHBDC showed scattered correlation with the results from the the finite-element modeling of composite multiple steel box girder bridges (Sennah et al, 2003). As a results, more precise expressions for load distribution factors among box-girders in composite bridge construction is needed (Suksawang, 2007).

1.3 The Objectives.
The objectives of the research are to: 1. Investigate the parameters that influence the behavior of straight simply-supported composite multiple box-girder bridges subjected to CHBDC truck loading and correlate the results with available CHBDC and AASHTO-LRFD specified values to examine their accuracy in structural design.
2. Determined the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors of such bridge using the

three-dimensional finite-element modeling to develop more reliable expressions for structural design.

1.4 The Scopes of the research
The scope of the research includes: 1. Conduct a literature review of previous research and the code of practice related to the behavior of straight simply-supported composite bridges and related load distribution factors. 2. Develope of the three-dimensional finite-element (FEA) models of straight composite bridges made of concrete slab supported over steel box girders and subjtected to different CHBDC truck loading conditions.

3. Conduct a parametric study on different key parameters that ruled the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors such as number of lanes, number of box girders, bridge span length and girder spacing. 4. Correlate the FEA results with the results obtained from CHBDC and AASHTO-LRFD equations to examine the level of accurancy of the code design values. 5. Develop more reliable emperical expressions for the moment and shear distribution factors for such bridges in lieu of code equations.

CHAPTER  LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 General
The design of bridges in North America is conducted using North American Bridge Design Codes such as CHBDC (2010), AASHTO-LRFD Specification (2010). All these design codes and specifications consider the longitudinal and transverse effect of wheel load as uncoupled phenomena by simlyifing the design of a two-dimensional bridges to a beam subjected to truck loading. Then, the resulting bending moment and shear force are modified by multiplying them by a moment and shear distribution factors, respectively, to take into account the twodimensional effect of bridge superstructure in distribution the truck loading among girders. Simplifying the design is such manner is complex and necessitates a challenge to determine the level of conservativeness. Some of these girder bridges include the single concrete box girder bridge shown in Fig. 2.1, the concrete multi-box girder bridge shown in Fig. 2.2, the composite concrete slab-over steel I-girders shown in Fig. 2.3, the steel box-girder bridge with orthotropic steel deck shown in Fig. 2.4 and the composite concrete slab-over multiple spine steel girder bridge shown in Fig. 2.5. The following subsections presented the literature related to these bridges including the slab-type bridges.

2.1.1 Slab Bridges
The concrete bridge is considered the simplest type of bridges. It is considered more economical and easier to erect although it may require more concrete materials and reinforcement for longer spans. This type of bridges is considered economical for simply-supported spans up to 9 m and a spans up to 12 m for continuous slabs. Composite slabs were used by many researchers. In 2004, Sudou and Sugihara developed composite slab called a "Hit Slab". It contains a bulb plate with studs. In 2009, Kim and Jeong conducted experiments to study the steel-concrete composite bridges deck with profiled sheeting shear connectors and compared the experimental Findings with reinforced concrete slab. Results showed that the ultimate load-carrying capacity for the

4

proposed deck system is greater than that for the reinforced concrete slabs by about 220%, with
composite slab weight of 23% less than that for the reinforced concrete slab.

2.1.2 Steel-Concrete Composite I-Girder Bridges
These types of bridges are usually used in straight and curved alignments. However, it may not be economical for sharp curved alignment because of its low torsional stiffness and stability when compared to box-girder type. In general , this type of bridges is desirable because of its simplicity in fabrication and erection. In 1992, Tarhini and Frederick used I-girder bridges to evaluate the AASHTO wheel load distribution factors. They then developed more reliable expressions for the wheel load distribution among girders which were similar in format to those in AASHTO Specifications. In 2010, Khalafalla and Sennah, investigated the behaviour of curved reinforced concrete slab on I-girder under the dead load condition to determine the major internal forces in selected bridge configurations to examine the code provisions for curvature limitations to treat a curved bridge as a straight bridge in structural design. Results showed that CHBDC and AASHTO-LRFD curvature limitations are unsafe in many bridge cases. They developed more reliable expressions for curvature limitation as a function of brige type, span, width and radius of curvature.

2.1.3 Steel-Concrete Composite Box girder Bridges
Generally, there are two types of composite bridges; one with concrete deck slab and the other one with orthotropic steel deck supported over steel box girders. This type of bridges exhibits high torsional stiffness as well as flexural stiffness as compared to the I-girder bridge type. CHBDC and AASHTO-LRFD specifies load distribution factors for shear and moment. However, Hassan (2005) showed that these factors conservative in some cases and underestimate the girder moment and shear in other cases.

2.2 Methods of Analysis Used in Bridge Design and Analysis
The following sub-sections present a summary of the structural analysis methods specified by CHBDC and AASHTO-LRFD Specifications for straight box-girder bridges. These methods can be used to analyze bridges if the conditions to use the code load distribution factors are not met.
5

2.2.1 Grillage Analogy Method
In 1975, Hambly and Pennells applied the grillage analogy method to cellular deck bridges which modeled as a grid assembly to evaluated the stiffness parameters for grillage analysis. In 1982, Cheng et al. used the finite-element to established the authority of grillage analogy method and the orthotropic plate method to calculate the longitudinal moment and transverse shear in multi-spine box girder. Results show that accuracy can be achieved if the numbers of spines is not less than three. In 1984, Evans et al. established a new technique to model the torsional stiffness of closed cells by means of an equivalent I-beam torsion stiffness which later established by Evans and Shanmugam. In 1997, Razqpur et al, used this method to analyze straight and curved bridges by modelling each segment with three nodal and six degree of freedom each.

2.2.2 Orthotropic Plate Theory Method
Canadian Highway Bridges Design Code has recommended this method in the analysis of straight box-girder bridges of multi-spine cross-section. In this method, the flexural and torsional stiffness and the stiffness of the diaphragm over the girders length were lumped into equivalent stiffness orthotropic plate with equivalent section properties. In 1969, Cheung recommended this method for curved bridges of high torsion rigidity such as multiple-spine girders. In 1982, Cheung et al. used three-dimensional analysis for multi-spine box girders to establish the capability of orthotropic and grillage methods and compare the results to stand on their level of accuracy.

2.2.3 Folded Plate Method
This method is suitable for linear elastic analysis of box-girder bridges by means of the elastic theory and by modeling the multiple-spine box-girder bridge as a folded system by considering both ends simply-supported by infinite stiff diaphragms in their planes and unified the longitudinal plate element along their longitudinal edge at joints. The folded plate method is suitable for simply-supported box-girder bridges with no intermediate diaphragm. In 1964, DeFries and Scordelis applied this method for general plate structures. In 1966, Scordelis and Gerasimenko, studied the behaviour of two reinforced-concrete folded plate models for a
6

structure under load used by Evans and Rockey. Later this method has been applied to analyze box girders by using an ordinary folded plate analysis. In 1994, Sitaram et al. compared the results obtained from the folded plate method and the finite-element modelling using quadratic shell elements. In 1984, Scordelis developed a Berkeley Computer Program, incorporating the folded-plate method, for simply-supported straight or curved and single-span or continuous bridges with single or multi cell box girder. In 1984, Batla et al, applied this method to straight folded plate type structures. The folded plate method was restricted to be used for bridges with line-support condition as specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code.

2.2.4 Finite Strip Method
The finite-strip method is a shift method between the folded-plate and finite-element methods. This method were used in the analysis of circularly and orthotropic curved plate elements for which direct application of the theory of elasticity becomes excessively concerned and considered as a prevailing technique. The methodology is to divide the bridge into narrow longitudinal number of strips in circumferential direction to the other end. it considers the bending, warping and membrane distortional effect in the finite strip. The finite-strip and finiteelement methods are different in the assumption of displacement interpolation functions. In finite-strip method, the displacement functions for the resulting finite-strip are assumed as changeable mixture for longitudinally and are polynomials in the transverse direction. In 1970, Cheung et al used the finite-strip method to analyze simply-supported slab and girder bridges. In 1978, Cheung and Chan adopted this method to analyze straight multi-spine and multi-cell box girder bridges to define the effective width of the compression flanges. In 1985, Cheung introduced the finite-strip method to analyze box girders with deep or inclined girders and slab bridges with or without concentric beams.

In 1985, Arzumi et al. studied the behaviour of curved composite box girders with different cross-section geometry. In 1989, Cheung and Li applied the finite-strip method by using strips with curvilinear coordinate system and variable width to analyze the behaviour of the webs of continuous box-girder bridges. In 1990, Cheung et al. used the finite-strip method to investigate the improvement of two types of longitudinal shape functions for better accuracy. In 1990, Abdullah and Abdul-Razzak applied the finite-strip method to prestressed box-girder bridges. In
7

1994, Cheung et al. used a combination of the boundary element method and finite-strip method to analyze composite slab-on-girder and slab-on-box girder bridges and the results was very accurate in local bending moment results due to moving load. In 1999, Zureick and Naqib adopted the finite-strip method in bridge analysis too. Canadian Highway Bridges Design Code restricts the use of this method to single and multi-span bridges having interior supports equivalent to line supports.

2.2.5 Finite-Element Method
This numerical method present solutions to a problem that is not easy to be resolved. As such, this method has extensive applications in structural, fluid and thermal analyses. It have few advantages including being (i) powerful to multiple loading condition; (ii) aptitude to use many different materials distinguished in geometry and elasticity; (iii) able to determine accuracy prediction which makes the solution more acceptable; and (iv) applicable for irregular shape structure with different material charateristics. These methods became conventional techniques for the box-girder bridge analysis over the last decade. In this method, the structural is divided into elements connected together through nodal points. In 1941, Hrennikoff, was the first in history to use the finite-element method in analysis. In 1966, Roll and Aneja tested two types of bridge models made of simply supported box beam, both straight and curved in plan, to examine the accuracy of the finite-element modelling. In 1970, Sargious used the finite-element method to calculate the principal stresses and to obtain the stresses of two equal-span continues prestressed concrete beams.

In 1972, Sisodiya et al. used shell elements and new displacement function to derive the in-plane stiffness for variable depth of box-girder bridges. In1973, Yuki et al. used the method to Analyze suspension bridges for better accuracy. In 1974, Bazant et al. used it to analyse straight or curved single-cell girders with or without the presence of initial stress. In 1975, Fam and Turkstra used it in the analysis of box-girder bridges with orthogonal boundaries and arbitrary combination of straight and curved sections. In 1975, Moffat and Dowling suggested methods of simplifying the codes practice by the rules of shear lag. In 1979, Sargious et al. developed the monographs to determine the consequential forces and critical stresses due to external loads and prestressed forces at different locations of box-girder bridges. In 1981, Ghali et al. used the
8

finite-element method to analyze box-girder bridges and compared the results used in design of these types of bridges by the classical beam theories. In 1982, Owens et al. described new techniques for the fabrication of small-scale models of welded steel. In 1984, Kostem suggested how the final stresses and deformation check the designs for beam-slab type superstructures by the finite-element method. In 1984, Hays Jr developed a description of load distribution factor program application to find maximum distribution factors by the finite-element method across bridge cross-section. In 1985, Ishac et al. examined the the transverse moment in single-span and single-cell concrete box girder in simple bridge design. In 1990, Chan et al. analysed a three composite box girder over one or two year period by calculating the thermal stresses using the finite-element technique. In 1995, Tarhini et al. used the finite-element method to analyse boxgirder bridges and compared results with the published wheel load distribution formula. In1995, Gulta and Cheung formulated a combination of the finite-element and boundary element methods (BEM-FEM) and explained its effective application to box girder bridge analysis.

In 2001, Sennah and Kennedy discussed the design of straight and curved box-girder bridges, the current design, bracing effects, load distribution and construction issues. In 2003, Samaan et al. investigated the simply-supported straight and curved multiple-spine box-girder bridges, using finite-element methods. They inviestigated the effect of key parameters in the structural response of such bridges, including span length, number of box girder, number of lanes and presence of internal and external bracing between box girders. In 2003, Zhang et al. determined the dynamic impact factors for straight composite concrete-steel celluar bridges under AASHTO loading conditions. In 2006, Razapur et al. used the finite-element method to evaluate 50 composite Igirder bridge configurations for moment distribution factors. In 2008, Vasseghi et al. developed the design concept for continuous link slabs as a jointless bridge and investigated the bridge response using the finite-element method for straight and skew bridge. Investigators and designers consider the finite-element method as attractive because of its numerical effectiveness and flexibility in solving linear and non-linear static and dynamic problems. This method was recommended by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code for the analysis of box-girder bridges.

2.2.6 Finite-Difference Method
This method was used in analyzing structures but it is not as familiar as the finite-element method. (Tene et al., 1975). This methods is restricted to the anlaysis of plates or bridges as a plate of equivalent section properties.

2.2.7 Thin walled Beam Theory
Initially, the thin-walled beam method was established and applied on open-section under flexure. In 1949, Valsov was the first to apply this method on airplane wings structures. In 1966, Richmond verified the used of the thin-walled theory to box girder analysis using the exact treatment for the two-dimensional elasticity. In 1974, Bazant et al. used this method to analyze different examples of arch girders and straight girder bridges as well as in curved alignment. In 1980, Mikkola and Paavola developed a computer program using Valsov's method and the finite-element method taking into account the cross-section distortion, deformations and, stresses to determine the longitudinal, transverse and flexural straining actions for straight single-box girder. In 1984, Boswell and Zhang used it to solve straight and curved box beams for distortion that happened in thin-walled structural members. In 1985, Maisel used Valsov's method to analyze straight thin-walled box beams and measured the shear lag affects on thin-walled box beam in uniform sections of single-cell and multi-cell shapes. In 1989, Mavaddat and Mirza applied the thin-walled theory into a computer program to analyze straight single-, two- or threecell concrete box beams. In 1993, Kermani and Waldron developed a method of elastic analysis based on the stiffness approach which is economical and easier in investigating the response of continuous straight single-cell box girders under general loading conditions. In 2008, Zhang et al. derived the equation for continuous thin-walled straight box girders with segregated slabs. There are so many applications of thin-walled methods but most of them were applied on curved box girder bridges more than the straight ones.

2.2.8 Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks can be formed by placing many nodes of highly organized processing units together to form the neural network and the models of connecting those nodes called Architecture of Neural Networks. This type of Architecture Neural Network is divided into three
10

main types. The first type is called Feed-Forward on which only signals are transmitted from inputs to outputs in one direction and the standard types of this type consists of disjointed layers of nodes which are connected with succeeding layer in the same time. The second type is called Recurrent Networks, while the third type is called Cellular Neural Network. Neural networks were first used in 1980. This network is a non-linear system applied first to gather and determine the weight values and the connected pattern is then determined and neural networks is trained for possible interporation of data. Hassan (2005) using this technique to model the available data base he obtained for the load distribution factors for selected composite box grider bridges so that the load distribution factors of similar bridge configurations of different span length, bridge width and number of design lanes can be obtained by interpolation of data.

2.2.8.1 Artificial Neural Network Application in Structural Analysis
In 1980's, Artificial Neural Network was applied to structural engineering analysis by considering the available data as a non-linear system with a large interconnected processing numbers of units. In 1993, Jenkins used an objective function for the engineering design which was usually considered constrained. In 1995, Jenkins used neural network-based methods in structural design. In 1996, Jenkins used the same application of neural network and showed the alternatives of re-analysis by the Back-Propagation steps. In 1996, Li et al. used the Neural Network to analyse bridge conditions using five subnets designed to create the current bridge evaluation process. In 1998, Kaveh and Iranmanesh presented two Artificial Neural Network examples to design and analyze large-scale space structures using Counter-propagation Neural Net as well as the Back-propagation Neural Net. In 1999, Furuya and Lu used the Neural Network procedure to investigate how to achieve modeling between the design variables by Application Neural Network-global models and how the response of the structures can be by training a series of pattern on global design space. In 1999, Iranmanesh and Kaves used Counterpropagation Neural Network with parameters like the gradient computation or the weight matrices in the neural networks to express their approaches. In 1999, Rafiq et al. presented areas with defined policy and improved the powerful of using the Artificial Neural Network. They discussed how to use this method in solving engineering problems by using the Artificial Intelligent (AI). In 2006, Srinivas and Ramanjaneyulu trained Artificial Neural Network for many bridge deck with different configurations so that this application can be used for the
11

prediction of response of similar bridges. In 2006, Jenkins used an ordinary procedure of training but mutated the variables to calculate the values of trigonometric function in the analysis of reinforced concrete deep beams and to calculate buckling loads of steel hollow rectangular sections. Then they compared the results with the `exact' results and with conventional Backpropagation Training Method of Neural Network.

2.2.9 Experimental Studies
There were few experimental and theoretical studies conducted in the past to examine the structural response of composite bridges. In 1995, Ebeido et al. investigated the shear distribution factors by building and testing six simply-supported skew composite bridges subjected to simulated truck loading. In 1995, Helba and Kennedy investigated the ultimate limit state design for concrete slab-on I-girder bridges using laboratory-scale models and the finiteelement modeling. The experimental findings led to the development of the ultimate loading carrying capacity of such bridge using the yield-line theory. In 1997, Sennah et al. used finiteelement method to analyzed 120 simply-supported multi-cell bridges considering parameters such as span-to-depth ratio, number of lanes, bridge aspect ratio. They verified the theoretical results by by correlating them with the experimental findings obtained from testing few 1/12 linear-scale simply-supported bridge models. In 1998, Miller et al. examined experimentally the effects of the sequence of construction the deck slab on the response of laboratory-scale bridge model.

In 2002, Samaan et al. investigated the orientation of bridge bearing in composite box-girder bridges after vertifying the three-dimensional finite element model using experimental findings obtained from testing few laboratory scale composite concrete slab-over steel box-girder bridges. In 2003, Androus utilized the finite-element ABAQUS software to investigate the structural behaviour of straight and curved composite box-girder bridges under CHBDC truck loading conditions. He built and tested to-collapse four twin-box girder bridge models to verify the finite element results. In 2007, Samman et al. experimentally conducted a study on two-span continuous curved composite bridge models to evaluate their frequencies and correlate the results with those obtained from the finite-element modeling. In 2007, Suksawang and Nassif proposed new load distribution factors based on experimental testing of actual box girders of differnet
12

types, including steel spread box girders and prestressed bridges and the results from the finiteelement modelling

2.3 AASHTO Standard Methods
In bridge design, AASHTO introduced simplified method of analysis that is more convenient than analytical and numerical methods to define the truck load distribution across bridge crosssection. In this case, the bending moment and shear force in a girder is calculated for a single girder loaded by a line of AASHTO wheel loading. Then, the obtained values are to multiplied by a moment or shear distribution factor that take into account the increase in girder moment or shear due to loaded eccentricity in bridge cross-section. In the superseded AASHTO Standard for the Design of Highway Bridges (1996), the live load was considered as the HS20 truck or a line load, while AASHTO-LRFD Specifications (2010) considers the live load as the HS20 truck in conjunction with the lane load. In 1996, AASHTO Standard specifications used the AASHTO simplified formula for distribution factors based on a research done by Newmark in 1940's (1948). This formula was used to obtained the maximum bending moment in individual girders under wheel loads of truck or lane loading of HS20, then multiplying them by (S/2) or (S/D) where S is the girders spacing in feet and D is a constant depends on the types of girders. This formula was proven to be successful and accurate for short girders spacing of 1.8 m and short span of 18 m in straight (non skewed) bridges. However, it proved to be not precise for medium and long span bridges.

In 1960, Scordelis et al. proved that the design of concrete celluar bridges is govered by the girder bending as well as the transverse distribution between the girders that affects the design of the deck slab. In 1967, Guilford and Vanhorn developed lateral distribution factors for vehicle load on slab-beam bridges. In 1975, Heins and Kuo established reasonable lateral load distribution factors in combination with AASHTO load design Method to developed equations which involved solutions for inelastic actions by introducing modifications to the elastic response. In 1977, Culham and Ghali developed a formula for the wheel load distribution in simply-supported concrete bridge in the form T or I shapes and interconnected by cross girders. In 1987, Imbsen et al. defined different strength and live loading formula similar to the load

13

distribution factor method in AASHTO Standard. In 1996, AASHTO specified load distribution factors for girder mements in straight reinforced concrete box girder bridges of different design.

2.4 AASHTO-LRFD Method
Jahanston and Mattock (1967) and Fountain and Mattock (1968) analyzed a folded plate structure using a computers program to study the distribution of lateral loads in simply-supported composite multi-spine box-girder bridges with no transverse diaphragm. In developing empirical expressions for load distribution, the effect of the internal and external bracing was not taken into consideration. In addition, the ratio of the number of lanes to the number of boxes in bridge cross-section was taken between 0.5 and 1.5. Moreover, the study is limited to bridge having number of spines equal to number of lanes. This expression is as follows:

WL = 0.1+1.7
Where: WL NB NL = live load distribution factor for each straight box girder = number of box girder = number of Lanes

(2.1)

AASHTO was first adopted this empirical expression in 1994 and later ASSHTO-LRFD adopted it in 1998. In 1997, Foinquinos et al. calculated the effects of live load distribution factors as affected by the presence of the intermediate diaphragms in straight multiple-spine steel boxgirder bridges. Results showed that composite bridges with three steel box girders and two intermediate diaphragms, a redistribution of stresses in the range of 18% occurred and that insignificant increase in stresses was observed with increase in the number of intermediate diaphragm beyond 2. In 1997. Mabsout et al analyzed 120 models of simply-supported composite steel-girder bridges to study the effects of few parameters on the structural response, including presence of sidewalk, span length, girder spacing and railing. The finite-element

14

results showed an increase of 30% in load-carrying capacity in case of the presence of the sidewalk and railing.

In 1998 and 1999, Mabsout et al. analyzed two-equal-span straight composite steel girder bridge to study the effect of continuity on bridge response under truck loading. They observed that a reduction of 15% can be made in case of using AASHTO empirical formula for continuous bridges. In 2001, Shahawy and huang investigated the AASHTO-LRFD load distribution factors. Their results for bridge girder spacing 2.4 m and overhung of 0.9 m shows an error as low as 10% for the interior girder and 30% for the exterior one. In 2004, Phuvoravan et al developed new simplified equations for load distribution factors using the finite-element modelling. In 2004, Samaan et al. investigated continuous curved composite multiple-spine box-girder bridges with bracing spacing less than 10 m to examine the AASHTO-LRFD and CHBDC load distribution factors and impact factor using the finite-element ABAQUS software. The results showed that the most effective parameters influencing the load distribution factors were the span length, number of design lanes, and number of box girders and the span-to-radius of curvature ratio. Expressions for the load distribution factors were proposed. In 2005, Puckett et al. investigated the load distribution factors using Henry method and Lever Arm method to evaluate the shear and moment distribution factors. Results were more accurate than current AASHTOLRFD equations but the study was limited to straight bridges.

2.5 Canadian Highway Bridges Design Code
In 2000, CHBDC specified simplified method for longitudinal bending moment and shear force in concrete slab-over multiple-spine steel box-girder bridges. Figures 2.6 through 2.8 show the CHBDC truck loading configuration used to design such bridges. CHBDC specifies that girder longitudinal bending moment in multiple-spine box-girder bridges can be written as:

CHAPTER  FINITE-ELEMENT ANALYSIS
3.1 General
The results from the literature review showed that the finite-element method is best approach to model composite concrete slab deck-on-steel box girder bridges to investigate their load distribution factors for moment, shear, and deflection. In the finite-element modeling, the

structure is divided into discrete elements connected together by nodal points. A typical finite element has a stiffness matrix relating the nodal vector displacement to nodal applied forces and can be expressed as functions of properties and shapes or geometries of elements. There are few types of functions shapes, namely: (i) one dimensional functions shape; (ii) two-dimensional function shape; and (iii) three-dimensional function shape. The one-or two-dimensional function shape can easily be solved without using computers. In a three-dimensional funation shape, the procedure would be more complicated and difficult to be solved because of many complicated equations that cannot be solved easily and if it does, it would have error which are not acceptable.

SAP2000 software is one of few available computer software that is user-friendly. In SAP2000 software, it is easy to model any structural shape and to generate element meshing. Also, it is easy to edit or view any data using spread sheets and it has automatic sections and section properties. Few researcher used SAP2000 software in their research. In 2008, Abdel-Mohti and Pekcan used SAP2000 software to investigate the seismic response of skew reinforced-concrete box-girder bridges. The results for nonlinear static pushover analysis, and linear and nonlinear time history analysis were conducted with great accuracy. In 2010, Jan et al. characterized twolane box-girder bridges with different geometries subjected to truck loading using SAP2000 software. In 2010, Zhang et al. developed finite-element program BGAS for shear lag analysis using FORTRAN languages which showed good correlation between the FEA modeling and the experimental findings. In the current study, SAP2000 was used to analyse composite concrete slab-on steel box-girder bridges.

3.2 Finite-element Approach
The finite-element method is used in the field of structural engineering and in mathematical physics to solved problems. The methodology in this numerical method of analysis starts in discretization a model by dividing it into an equivalent system of smaller bodies or units called "elements" to decrease the error. The smaller mesh sizes will be, the more accurate results will be determined for the load prescribed and for the structural response to loads resulted in at the "nodes". The elements were interconnected at nodes common to two or more and an equation is then formulated combining all the elements to obtain solutions for one whole body. The stiffness matrix of each element is derived by using displacement formulations, and the global stiffness matrix of the entire structure can be formulated by the direct stiffness method. This global stiffness matrix, along with the given displacement boundary conditions and applied loads are then solved. The finite-element method is really a very extensive tools that has improved for engineering design standards and for successful methodology in most design application process before any design processed or manufactured. It is considered as most accurate and a faster design method that decrease error and increase productivity.

The formula in matrix equations expressed as follow: [P] = [K] [U] Where: [P] [K] [U] = nodal load vector = global stiffness matrix = nodal displacement vector (3.1)

In the finite-element modeling, problems can be solved either it is linear or non-linear. The global stiffness matrix is appropriate to many problem types but it is important to index the displacement and the stiffness in appropriate places for the particular modeled elements.

22

3.3 SAP2000 Software
SAP2000 software is one of finite-element popular programs used internationally to estimate structural responses due to different imposed loads. It is very powerful to Analyze and solve determinates and indeterminate structural analysis problems of complicated structures. It can solve static or dynamic problems, linear or non-linear types of structures utilizing both geometric and material properties. There are many types of dimension elements in SAP2000 software, namely: two-dimensional solid elements, three-dimensional solid elements, two-dimensional plane elements, three-dimensional frame element, and three-dimensional shell elements. In this particular shell element, the elements can be either three or four nodes depending on the modeled members. Shell elements are modeled by dividing the structure into an equivalent system of smaller elements which interconnected at nodes. The membrane performance of such elements includes a transformational in-plane stiffness components and rotational stiffness component in the direction standards to the plane of the elements.

SAP2000 software is extensive in analyzing the structures in both two dimensional and threedemensional format. It has the adventage of drawing windows of different planes and navigates for live multiple models and for complex modes. It's very simple in controlling complex geometries and easy to describe the concrete or steel shapes or fix modulus of elasticity for any materials particularly for composite construction. In 2002, El-Tawil and Okeil Investigated the behaviour of composite box-girder bridges using the finite-element method to analyse box girder bridges. Figure 3.1 shows view of the finite-element modelling and the mesh size used to attain more accurate results for the load prescribed.

3.4 Finite-element Modeling of Composed Multiple Box girder Bridges
Back in 1941, Hrennikoff was first used finite-elements to investigate membrane and plate bending of structures but with limited applications to only rectangular regular shapes rather than irregular shapes until 1971. With the development of shell elements and other sophisticated elements, computer software were developed and continued to grow in capabilities to solve engineering problems. In this research, SAP2000 software was used to mode the composite multiple-spine box-girder bridges. Shell elements were used to model simply-supported
23

composite concrete deck-on multiple-spine steel box-girder bridges to determine their load distribution characteristics under CHBDC truck loading. Thirty-six composite concrete slab deck-on-steel box girder bridges were modeled a three-dimensional form by considering the concrete deck slab, steel box girder, cross steel bracing and the restraint at each end of the bridges. In 2000, Nour used finite-element modeling, using ABAQUS software, to investigate the load distribution factors for similar bridges but under AASHTO Standard truck.

3.4.1 Material Modeling
In SAP2000 software, it is fundamental that material properties are defined so that the final results would be more accurate and acceptable. Material properties input includes modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio of the material. In this study, it was assumed that steel and concrete materials were homogenous and elastic. Concrete slab modulus of elasticity, Ec, was taken 27,000 MPa, with Poisson's ratio of 0.2. Steel modulus of elasticity, Es, was taken 200,000 MPa, with Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The concrete deck slab was 225 mm thick and has full shear interaction with the steel box girders.

3.4.2 Geometric Modeling
In this study the geometry of bridge superstructure is achieved by the proper selection of the number of elements representation the deck slab, webs, bottom flange, top flange, cross bracings and end diaphrams. Also, geomtetic nonlinearity was not considered in this study.

3.4.3 Modeling of Composite Bridges 3.4.3.1 Sensitive Sample Modeling for Composite Bridges
Sensitivity study was conducted to investigate the accuracy of the FEA modeling using SAP2000. A sample bridge configuration shown in Table 3.1 was analyzed as a beam under central load and other time using SAP2000 three-dimensional finite-element modeling. Table 3.1 shows similar trend in the values of mid-span flexural stresses, and deflection as well as the shear force at the support line.

24

3.4.3.2 Modeling of Composite Concrete Slab-on-steel Box girder Bridges
To model the studies bridges, the three-dimensional shell element in SAP2000 software was used to model the bottom flange, webs, and deck slabs. It has four corner nodes with six degree of freedom each, three displacements (U1, U2, U3) and three rotation (1, 2, 3). Two-node frame elements were used to model the bracing members. The top flange of the steel box was informed in this study.As such, the web is assumed continuoud to the centreline of the top deck slab.

3.5 Aspect Ratio
Shell element aspect ratio is very important in representing the actual structural behavior. It is the ratio of the longest to shortest dimensions of the quadrilateral elements. In 2002, Logan mentioned that it is important that the aspect ratio is maintained below 4. In this parametric study, the aspect ratio was kept below 2.5 in each element division to obtain accurate results. This was achieved by using 50 elements in the longitudinal direction for 20-meter length composite bridge, 100 elements in the longitudinal direction for 40-meter length, 150 elements in the longitudinal direction for 60-meter length and 200 elements in the longitudinal direction for 80-meter length. Considering dividing the bottom flange width and the concrete slab between webs into four element, the aspect ratio was maintained less than 2.5 for all studied bridges.

3.6 Boundary Conditions
To achieve the boundary conditions at the support lines, one side of the bridges was assumed roller while the other side of the bridge is assumed hinged.The lower points of the web at the support lines were used to enforce this boundary condition. Figures 3.2 and 3.3 shows views of the FEA models extracted from SAP2000.

3.7 Applied Loads
In this study, composite bridge were modeled with different span lengths and different bridge widths and subjected to different loading conditions. CHBDC truck and lane loading. Chapter 4 summarizes the applied loading cases per CHBDC. SAP2000 accepts loading the structures at the nodes with concentrated load or on the shell element as uniform loading. In addition, the
25

software can consider the truck as a moving load over the top slab to get the maximum effect for flexural stresses at the mid-span location and the maximum shear force at the support line.

3.8 Calculation of Distribution Factors

3.8.1 Calculation of Moment Distribution Factors

CHAPTER IV RESULTS FROM THE PARAMATIC STUDY
4.1 General
The structural response of the composite concrete slab deck-on-steel multiple-spine box-girder bridges was evaluated using the finite-element modelling. A practical-design-oriented parametric study was conducted to determine the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors of such bridges. Thirty-six simply-supported straight bridges were modelled using SAP2000 software. Two live load conditions were considered in this study, namely: (i) CHBDC truck loading including the dynamic load allowance, and (ii) the lane loading, including a combination of 9 kN/m uniform load to be distributed over a 3 m width and 80% of the truck loading without dynamic load allowance. Figure 4.1 shows a schematic diagram of the finite element modelling of bridge cross-secion. While Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.3 shows schematic diagrams of number of boxes considered for two-, three- and four- lane bridge cross-section, respectively. In case of two-lane bridges, 2, 3 and 4 boxes were considered to form bridge cross-section of the same width. In case of three-lane bridges, number of boxes per same bridge width was taken as 3, 4 and 5, while the number of boxes for four-lane bridge cross-section was taken 4, 5 and 6. Both internal and external bracing between boxes were considered in this study. External bracings were also considered between boxes at the support in addition to solid steel diaphragm inside boxes at the support lines.

Bridge spans considered in this study were 20, 40, 60 and 80 m. While deck width was taken 9, 12.5, and 16 m. Considering barrier wall width of 0.5 m, the total bridge widths considered in this study were 10, 13.5 and 17 m. The number of design lanes was taken 2, 3 and 4. The spanto-depth ratio of the steel boxes was taken 25. Thicknesses of steel webs and bottom flanges were taken 16 mm, while the thickness of the concrete slab was taken 225 mm. The number of boxes within bridge cross-section was distributed evenly so that the length of the slab cantilever is half the width of the box. Table 4.1 summarizes the geometric configurations of bridges considered in the parametric study. Table 4.2 summarizes the material properties of steel and concrete used in the finite-element modelling.
31

Different truck loading conditions were considered in this study to maximum the effects on the box girders. Figure 4.5 shows schematic diagrams of the truck loading conditions for ultimate limit state, fatigue limit state and serviceability limit state design for two-lane bridges. Figures 4.6 and 4.7 showed similar loading conditions but for three-lane bridges. Figures 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 show similar loading cases for four-lane bridges. The parametric study was conducted to examine the efftec of the following key parameters in the load distribution factors: 1. Bridge span length, L; 2. Bridge width, B; 3. Number of design lanes; 4. Number of box girders, N; and 5. Box girder spacing, S. .

4.2 Moment Distribution Factors
In analyzing the bridges using the finite-element modelling, the moment distribution factor was calculated for each box girder for each loading case. Then, the greatest one of all girders for loadings cases used to ultimiate limit state (ULS) design was selected. Similar procedure was followed for calculating the moment distribution factor for fatigue limit state (FLS) design. Appendix A summarises the moment distribution factors for ULS and FLS designs along with the loading case from which the maximum values were obtained. In addition, these tables present correlations of the FEA results with CHBDC and proposed equation values. The following subsections present discussions on the effect of each parameter on the moment distrution factors.

4.2.1 Effect of Bridge Span Length on Moment Distribution Factors
Figures 4.11 and 4.16 depict the effect of the span length on the moment distribution factor of four-lane bridge at ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state, respectively. It can be observed that there is no specific trend in the change of the moment distribution factor with increase in span length when the number of design lanes is involved. For example, for two-lane bridge, it can be observed that the moment distribution factor slightly increases with increase of span length from 20 to 60 m. No increase was observed for span length beyond 80 m. This trend is altered for three-lane bridges where there is insignificant increase change in the moment
32

distribution factors for spans ranging from 20 to 60 m. However, the moment distribution factor increases for spans greater than 60 m. In case of four-lane bridges, the moment distribution factor at ULS decreases with increase in bridge spans from 20 to 40 m, while there is

insignificant change in the moment distribution factor for spans greater that 40 m. Similar trend can be observed in Figures 4.16 for moment distribution factors at the FLS. Therefore, it is expected that there would be an empirical expression for the moment distribution factor in the simplified moment of analysis for each number of design lanes, which is the current case with CHBDC load distribution factors.

4.2.2 Effect of Number of Steel Box Girder on Moment Distribution Factors
The Effect of number of steel box girders on the behaviour of the composite concrete slab-onsteel box-girder bridges was studies. Figure 4.12 depcits the moment distribution factor at ULS for 20-m span bridges having different number of box girders for the same bridge width. It can be observed that the moment distribution factor decreases with increase in number of box girders, irrespective of the change in the number of design lanes. Figure 4.13 shows the change in moment distribution factor at ULS with the change in the number of box girders for different bridge span lengths of a three-lane bridge. It can be observed that the trend of increase in moment distribution factor with increase in number of box girders is not altered with change in span length. As such, one may expect that the the developed equation for moment distribution factor should include the change in number of box girders for the same bridge width of number of design lanes. Since the increase in number of boxes within the same bridge width increases both the flexural and torsional stiffness of the bridge, thus enhancing the load distribution characteristics of the girders, it would be appropriate to include the flexural and torsional stiffness values in the moment distribution factor equations, which is the case with CHBDC simplified method for box griders. Similar trend was observed for the three-lane bridges with different span lengths as depicted in Figs. 4.17 and 4.18 for moment distribution factors at FLS.

4.2.3 Effect of the Spacing of the Box Girders on Moment Distribution Factors
One may consider the effect of number of boxes within the same bridge width in a different sense through the change in the girder spacing. Within increase in number of boxes for the same bridge width, girder spacing decreases. Figures 4.15 and 4.20 depict the change of the moment
33

distributon at ULS and FLS, respectively, for 20-m span bridge with the change in girder spacing. It can be obserbed that there is a slight increase in moment distribution factor with increase in girder spacing. Still, one may consider the change in girder spacing in lieu of number of boxes in developed moment distribution factor's equations.

4.2.4 Effect of Numbers of Design Lanes on Moment Distribution Factors
The effect of numbers of design lanes is investigated for ultimate and fatigue limit state designs. Figures 4.14 and 4.19 depict the change in moment distribution factors with the change in number of design lanes as well as the span length at ULS and FLS, respectively. In case of FLS, the change is obvious as the moment distribution factor increases with increase in number of design lanes, irrespective of the change in span length. However, at ULS , the moment distribution factor slightly decrease with increase in number of design lanes for 40- and 60-m Span bridges.

4.2.5 Comparison between CHBDC Moment Distribution Equations and the Finite-Element Results
Canadian Highway Bridge design Code recommends using specified empirical equations to calculate moment distribution factors for different types of bridges. Appendix A lists the CHBDC moment distribution factors for the studies bridges along with values obtained from the finite-element analysis, while Figures. 4.44 and 4.45 show correlation between them at ULS and FLS, respectively. It can be observed that CHBDC generally specifies moment distribution factors at ULS and FLS greater than those obtained from the FEA analysis. In some cases, it reaches about 70% greater that FEA results in some cases. As such, the following sections will introduce more reliable expressions for economical design of such bridges.

4.2.6 Comparison between AASHTO-LRFD Live Load Distribution Equation and Moment Distribution Factors Obtained from Finite-element Analysis
The AASHTO-LRFD Bridge Design Sepecifications specify the following equation for live load distribution factors for multiple-spine steel bridges. More information about this equation can be found in Chapter 2.
34

WL = 0.1+1.7

(4.1)

Figures 4.46 and 4.47 show correlation between the AASHTO-LRFD moment distribution factors and FEA results for the studies bridges at ULS and FLS, respectively. It can be observed that AASHTO-LRFD overestimates the moment distribution factors at ULS by a significant magin. However, it overestimate the response in some bridges with a significant margin and underestimate the response in few cases. For example FEA moment distribution factor for twolane bridges with three box girders and 20 m span length was 0.93 but AASHTO-LRFD reading was 1.65, A 43% overestimation in the response.

4.3 Effect of Parameters on Shear Distribution Factors
In analysing the bridges using the finite-element modelling, the shear distribution factor was calculated for each box girder for each loading case. Then, the greatest one of all girders for loadings cases used to ultimiate limit state (ULS) design was selected. Similar procedure was followed for calculating the shear distribution factor for fatigue limit state (FLS) design. Appendix B summarises the shear distribution factors for ULS and FLS designs along with the loading case from which the maximum values were obtained. In addition, these tables present correlations of the FEA results with CHBDC and proposed equation values. The following subsections present discussions on the effect of each parameter on the shear distrution factors.

4.3.1 Effect of Bridge Span Length on Shear Distribution Factors
Figures 4.21 and 4.22 depicts the effect of the span length on the shear distribution factor of four-lane bridge at ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state, respectively. It can be observed that the shear distribution factor generally increases with increase of span length. This trend is altered for three-lane bridges where there is insignificant increase change in the moment distribution factors for spans ranging from 20 to 40 m. Figures 27 and 28 depict t he change in shear distribution factors at ULS and FLS, respectively, with the change in span length of fourlane bridges, in combination with increase in grider spacing or number of design lanes. Again, general trend was observed but from a different angle.
35

4.3.2 Effect of Numbers of Steel Box Girder on Shear Distribution Factors
The Effect of number of steel box girders on the behaviour of the composite concrete slab-onsteel box-girder bridges was studies. Figure 4.23 depcits the shear distribution factor at ULS for 20-m span bridges having different number of box girders for the same bridge width. It can be observed that the shear distribution factor increases with increase in number of box girders, irrespective of the change in the number of design lanes. Figure 4.24 shows the change in shear distribution factor at ULS with the change in the number of box girders for different bridge span lengths of a four-lane bridge. It can be observed that the trend of increase in shear distribution factor with increase in number of box girders is not altered with change in span length. As such, one may expect that the the developed equation for shear distribution factor should include the change in number of box girders for the same bridge width of number of design lanes. Similar trend was generally observed for the four-lane bridges with different span lengths as depicted in Figures. 4.30 and 4.31 for shear distribution factors at FLS.

4.3.3 Effect of Steel Box Girder Spacing on Shear Distribution Factors
One may consider the effect of number of boxes within the same bridge width in a different sense through the change in the girder spacing. Within increase in number of boxes for the same bridge width, girder spacing decreases. Figures 4.26 and 4.27 depict the change of the shear distributon factors at ULS and FLS, respectively, for 20-m span bridge with the change in girder spacing. It can be obserbed that there is an increase in shear distribution factor with increase in girder spacing. Still, one may consider the change in girder spacing in lieu of number of boxes in developed moment distribution factor's equations. Figures 4.33 and 4.34 show similar trend at FLS.

4.3.4 Effect of Number of Design Lanes on Shear Distribution Factors
The effect of numbers of design lanes is investigated for ultimate and fatigue limit state designs. Figures 4.25 and 4.32 depict the change in shear distribution factors with the change in number of design lanes as well as the span length at ULS and FLS, respectively. In case of FLS, the change is obvious as the shear distribution factor increases with increase in number of design
36

lanes, irrespective of the change in span length. However, at ULS , there is a slight change in the shear distribution factor for two- and three-lane bridges. However, it increases with increase in number of design lanes from 3 to 4. For example, for 40-m span bridge, the shear distribution increased linearly from 1.37 to 1.5 with increase in number of design lanes from 2 to 4. Also, it increases from 1.53 to 2.88 with increase of number of design lanes from 2 to 4 for 60-m span bridge at FLS.

4.3.5 Comparison between CHBDC Shear Distribution Equations and Those Obtained from Finite-element Analysis
Canadian Highway Bridge design Code recommends using specified empirical equations to calculate shear distribution factors for different types of bridges. Appendix B lists the CHBDC shear distribution factors for the studies bridges along with values obtained from the finiteelement analysis, while Figs. 4.54 and 4.55 show correlation between them at ULS and FLS, respectively. It can be observed that CHBDC generally specifies shear distribution factors at ULS lower than those obtained using the FEA analysis. However, CHBDC always

overestimates the shear distribution factor at FLS with a big margin in many bridge configurations considered in this study. As such, the following sections will introduce more reliable expressions for economical design of such bridges.

4.3.6 Comparison between AASHTO-LRFD Live load Distribution Equation and Shear Distribution Factors Obtained from the Finite-element Analysis
The AASHTO-LRFD Bridge Design Sepecifications specify equation 4.1 live load shear distribution factors for multiple-spine steel bridges. Figures 4.56 and 4.57 show correlation between the AASHTO-LRFD shear distribution factors and FEA results for the studies bridges at ULS and FLS, respectively. It can be observed that AASHTO-LRFD overestimates the shear distribution factors at ULS and FLS by a significant magin for many bridge configurations considered in this study. However, it underestimates the response in few bridge cases as

depicted in Figs. 4.56 and 4.57. As an example, for 80-m span bridge with two design lanes and two box girders, the AASHTO-LRFD shear distribution factor was 2.23 while the FEA analysis showed that it is 1.5 for FLS.
37

4.4 Effect of Parameters on Deflection Distribution Factors
CHBDC specifies the deflection distribution factor as the moment distribution factor at ULS. This study showed that both the moment and shear distribution factors should be treated differently. In analysing the bridges using the finite-element modelling, the deflection distribution factor was calculated for each box girder for each loading case. Then, the greatest one of all girders for loadings cases used to serviceability limit state (SLS) design was selected. Appendix C summarises the deflection distribution factors at SLS design. In addition, these tables present correlations of the FEA results with CHBDC and proposed equation values. The following subsections present discussions on the effect of each parameter on the deflection distrution factors.

4.4.1 Effect of Bridges Span Length on Deflection Distribution Factors
Figures 4.35 and 4.36 depict the effect of the span length on the deflection distribution factor of four-lane bridge at SLS with the change in number of lanes and number of box girders, respectively. It can be observed that there is no specific trend in the change of the deflection distribution factor with increase in span length.One may observe that the deflection distribution factor decreases with increase in bridge span from 20 to 40 m, then it generally increase with increase in bridge spans from 40 to 80 m.

4.4.2 Effect of Number of Box Girders on Deflection Distribution Factors
The Effect of number of steel box girders on the behaviour of the composite concrete slab-onsteel box-girder bridges was studies. Figure 4.37 depcits the deflection distribution factor at SLS for 20-m span bridges having different number of box girders for the same bridge width. It can be observed that the deflection distribution factor slightly increases with increase in number of box girders, irrespective of the change in the number of design lanes. Figure 4.38 shows the change in deflection distribution factor at SLS with the change in the number of box girders for different bridge span lengths of a two-lane bridge. It can be observed that insignificant change was observed in the shear distribution factor with increase in number of box girders.

4.4.3 Effect of Box Girder Spacing on Deflection Distribution Factors
One may consider the effect of number of boxes within the same bridge width in a different sense through the change in the girder spacing. Within increase in number of boxes for the same bridge width, girder spacing decreases. Figures 4.41, 4.42 and 4.43 depict the change of the deflection distributon factors at SLS with the change in girder spacing. It can be obserbed that there is slight change in deflection distribution factor with increase in girder spacing.

4.4.4 Effect of Number of Design Lanes on Deflection Distribution Factors
The effect of numbers of design lanes is investigated for SLS design. Figure 4.40 depicts the change in deflection distribution factors with the change in number of design lanes as well as the span length. It can be observed that the deflection distribution factor significantly increases with increase in number of design lanes.

4.4.5 Comparison between CHBDC Deflection Distribution Equation and Those Obtained from the Finite-Element Analysis
Canadian Highway Bridge design Code recommends using specified empirical equations to calculate deflection distribution factors for different types of bridges. Appendix C lists the CHBDC deflection distribution factors for the studies bridges along with values obtained from the finite-element analysis, while Fig. 4.76 shows correlation between them. It can be observed that CHBDC generally specifies deflection distribution factors at SLS greater than those

obtained from the FEA analysis. As such, the following sections will introduce more reliable expressions for economical design of such bridges.

4.4.6 Comparison between AASHTO-LRFD Live Load Distribution Equation and Deflection Distribution Factors Obtained from Finite-Element Analysis
The AASHTO-LRFD Bridge Design Sepecifications specify equation 4.1 live load deflection distribution factors for multiple-spine steel bridges. Figure 4.77 shows correlation between the AASHTO-LRFD deflection distribution factors and FEA results for the studies bridges at SLS. It can be observed that AASHTO-LRFD overestimates the deflection distribution factors by a
39

significant magin for many bridge configurations considered in this study. However, it underestimates the response in few bridge cases as depicted in Fig. 4.77.

4.5 Development of Empirical Equations for More Reliable Load Distribution Factors
Based on the data generated from the parametric study, more reliable and economical expressions for the moment, shear and deflection distribution factors were deduced using a statistical package for curve fit. The following subsections introduce these equations along with their correlations with the FEA results to gain confidence in their use in practice.

4.5.1 Proposed Moment Distribution Factors
CHBDC specifies the following equation for the moment distribution factors at ULS and FLS. More information in this equation can be found in Chapter 2.

Fm =

The parameters F and Cf in the equation were developed as follows as a function of the parameter  given in equation 2.8, and the number of boxes. F= (a+ b. B) Nc (4.3) (4.4)

C f = (d +e B)m

Where a, b, c, d, e and m are constants obtained using the least square technique incorporated in Microsoft Excel. Expressions of F and Cf were derived for moment distribution factor as listed in Table 4.3 for ULS design and Table 4.4 for FLS design. Appendix A summarizes the corresponding moment distribution factors obtained using these equation. Figures 4.48 through 4.53 show excellent correlation between the moment distribution factors obtained from the developed equations and those obtained from the FEA analysis.

CHBDC specifies the following equation for the shear distribution factors at ULS and FLS. More information in this equation can be found in Chapter 2.

FV =

The parameter F in the equation was developed as follows as a function of the span length and number of boxes. F = ( a + b.L). Nc (4.6)

Where a, b and c are constants obtained using the least square technique incorporated in Microsoft Excel. Expressions of F derived for shear distribution factor as listed in Table 4.5 for ULS design and Table 4.6 for FLS design. Appendix B summarizes the corresponding shear distribution factors obtained using these equation. Figures 4.54 through 4.63 show excellent correlation between the shear distribution factors obtained from the developed equations and those obtained from the FEA analysis. To provide alternatives to the above-mentioned Fv values, the parameter F in the equation was developed as follows as a function of the parameter  given in equation 2.8, and the number of boxes. F = ( a + b. B). Nc (4.8)

Where a, b and c are constants obtained using the least square technique incorporated in Microsoft Excel. Expressions of F were derived for shear distribution factor as listed in Table 4.7 for ULS design and Table 4.8 for FLS design. Appendix B summarizes the corresponding shear distribution factors obtained using these equation. Figures 4.64 through 4.69 show excellent correlation between the shear distribution factors obtained from the developed equations and those obtained from the FEA analysis.

41

Other set of equations for F to determine the shear distribution factor was derived as a fundtion of the of the parameter  given in equation 2.8, and box-girder spacing as follows. F = ( a + b .B) .Sc (4.9)

Where a, b and c are constants obtained using the least square technique incorporated in Microsoft Excel. Expressions of F were derived for shear distribution factor as listed in Table 4.9 for ULS design and Table 4.10 for FLS design. Appendix B summarizes the corresponding shear distribution factors obtained using these equation. Figures 4.70 through 4.75 show excellent correlation between the shear distribution factors obtained from the developed equations and those obtained from the FEA analysis.

4.5.3 Proposed Deflection Distribution Factors
CHBDC specifies equation 4.2 for the deflection distribution factors at SLS. the parameters F and Cf in the equation were developed as a function of the parameter  given in equation 2.8, and the number of boxes.Expressions of F and Cf were derived for delfection distribution factors as listed in Table 4.11. Appendix C summarizes the corresponding deflection distribution factors obtained using these equation. Figures 4.76 through 4.80 show good correlation between the deflection distribution factors obtained from the developed equations and those obtained from the FEA analysis.

CHAPTER V
SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

5.1 Summary
Composite box-girder bridges are recently used in modern highway urban system because of their profitable and structural aptitude advantages. North Americans Codes of Practice specify empirical equations for girder moment and shear forces in such bridges in the form of live load distribution factors. These factors were proven to be conservative in some cases and underestimate the response in other cases. Therefore, an extensive parametric study, using the finite-element modeling, was conducted to examine the key parameters that influence the load distribution factors of such bridges. A total of 276 prototype bridges were analyzed to evaluate girder bending moment, shear force and deflection distribution factors for simply-supported composite multiple box-girder bridges when subjected to CHBDC truck loading. Design parameters considered in this study were bridges span length, numbers of design lanes, number of box girders and girder spacing. The following sections summarize the research findings and recommendations for further research.

5.2 Conclusions
Bases on the data generated from the parametric study, the following conclusions are drawing: 1. The most important parameters that affecting the structural behaviour of simplysupported bridge are bridge span length, number of design lanes, number of box girders, flexural-to-torsional stiffness of girders and truck loading condition. 2. CHBDC equations for moment, shear and deflection distribution factors significantly overestimate the structural response in many bridge configurations and underestimate the response in few bridge cases. Similar conclusion is reached for the AASHTOLRFD load distribution factor equations.

43

3. Bases on the data generated from the parametric study, sets of empirical expression for
moment, shear and deflection distribution factors were developed for simply-supported composite bridge with multiple steel box girders. Excellent correlation between the developed equations and the FEA results was observed. Thus, engineers can use the developed expressions in designing new bridges and evaluate existing bridges with more confidence.

5.3 Recommendations for Future Research
1. Extend the developed equations to cover number of design lanes more that 4. 2. Study the effect of skew on the load distribution factors of box girder bridges. 3. Extend the study to cover the design of multiple-spine box girders made of precast concrete box beams or precast U shapes with cast-in-place deck slab. 4. Field testing to correlate the developed load distribution factors with those recorded during the test.
