Title: Database Development for Ontario's Local Calibration of Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) Distress Models Written by: Gulfam-E-Jannat Master of Applied Science in Civil Engineering, 2012 Ryerson University

Abstract
The AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) includes empirical distress models that need both global and local calibrations. The local calibration requires developing a database that would reflect local environments, design and maintenance practices in a particular jurisdictional region. The objective of the thesis is to develop a pavement database for local calibration before the MEPDG is to be implemented in Ontario. The database involves a hierarchical framework of the input parameters required for DARWin-ME, and the measured performance data are based on the MTO's PMS-2. To demonstrate the validity of the developed database a preliminary local calibration including clustering analysis is carried out for the IRI and total rutting. The calibration-validation analysis suggests that the IRI model can be best clustered based on the geographical zone whereas the highway functional class is the best clustering parameter for rutting during the local calibration.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION

1.1

Background

Most of the previous and recent pavement design methods including American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 1993 pavement design are empirical in nature. These were developed based on road tests in late 1950's (Schwartz and Carvalho 2007). Although these pavement design methods are still being widely used in majority of highway agencies in North America, they do not incorporate all possible local factors for pavement materials and environmental conditions. They also fail to capture the realistic local characteristics of the existing and future traffic volume and types.

A Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) was developed in the USA under NCHRP 1-37A in 2004 to address the shortcomings of empirical pavement design methods (Hall et al. 2010). MEPDG and related software have capabilities to analyze and predict performance of different types of pavements. Many highway agencies have plans to implement the MEPDG as their pavement design method. Implementation of MEPDG, however, requires data collection, training and local calibration/ validation of performance models in MEPDG.

The MEPDG uses mechanistic-empirical models to analyze input data for traffic, climate, materials and proposed structure. The models estimate damage accumulation over service life. 1

The MEPDG is applicable for designs of both flexible and rigid pavements. In addition, MEPDG also incorporates pavement performance (both structural and functional performance) in the design process. These performance predictions consist of pavement distresses and ride quality. The MEPDG for flexible pavements includes the following performance prediction modes (Velasquez et al. 2009): · Alligator cracking · Transverse cracking · Longitudinal cracking · Rutting · International Roughness Index (IRI)

The important aspect of MEPDG method is to evaluate and recalibrate the models of the above performance predictions for the local characteristics. To calibrate these models, a number of investigations are conducted (Velasquez et al. 2009; Hall et al. 2010; Hoegh et al. 2010; Darter et al. 2005 etc.) by different agencies (the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) and the Local Road Research Board (LRRB)) for specific local conditions.

The MEPDG incorporates a lot of improvement in pavement design, which brings more accuracy to the existing AASHTO Design Guide. Among the improvements this guide is likely to improve the implementation of performance prediction of transverse cracking, faulting, smoothness, the addition of climate inputs, better characterization of traffic loading inputs, more sophisticated structural modeling capabilities, and the ability to model real-world changes in material properties. It is found that the data base, material properties, traffic characteristics, and climatic conditions used in the global calibration are not enough to carry out day-to-day 2

pavement design activities for specific local conditions, and so their effect and adequacy needs to be determined in addition to other factors that will facilitate the efficient implementation of the MEPDG.

The performance models in the MEPDG were calibrated and validated by using the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program data, which includes pavement sections from many states in the USA and Canada as well. Such calibrations are normally referred as global calibration. Data sets from the LTPP database used in the global calibrations not only spanned the climatic conditions of several states, including some Canadian provinces, but also encompassed wide ranges of traffic, materials, and surface layer thicknesses. The purpose of the calibration is to establish transfer functions relating pavement responses (stresses, strains, and deflections) to specific forms of physical distresses, which mainly includes permanent deformation, cracking, and roughness. Although the national calibration-validation process has been very comprehensive, it is obvious that there is significant potential difference between `national' and `local' conditions including climate, material properties, traffic patterns, construction and maintenance activities. For these reasons, the pavement performance models in the MEPDG should be compared to and verified against local conditions.

One of the challenging issues in the local calibration exercise is to develop a suitable pavement distress database that can be used to calibrate the pavement distress models. A major source of the distress data are from the Pavement Management System (PMS), which is placed in many transportation agencies, including the Ministry of Transportation, Ontario (MTO). The MTO has been using the PMS since the 1980s, and now has evolved into its second generation, referred to as MTO PMS-2. Each year, MTO collects data regarding in-service field evaluation 3

of pavement performance, such as roughness, surface distress, ride quality and overall pavement condition from more than 1,700 sections across Ontario. These data are stored and managed in the PMS. However, the pavement distress data from the PMS cannot be directly used for local calibration of the MEPDG models because the PMS is for existing pavements, with the ultimate goal being network-level budget analysis and project prioritization. Therefore, there is a gap to convert the PMS condition data to a database that can be used for the MEPDG local calibration.

1.2

Objective and Significance

The main objectives of this study are: (1) to develop a pavement database for MEPDG calibration to local practices in Ontario; and (2) to develop a framework for local calibration. This project is funded by the MTO's Highway Infrastructure Innovation Funding Program (HIIFP).

The database developed in this study will allow a comprehensive local calibration and validation process in the future. The study will facilitate to assess the efficiency of local calibration of MEPDG distress models, and hence ensure better prediction of pavement distress, leading to an economic pavement maintenance program.

1.3

Methodology and Scope of the Study

In this thesis, the investigations focus on the review of existing distress database, formulation of damage indices from severity and density of cracking, characterization and clustering of pavement sections, development of calibration database and finally calibration of distress 4

models based on local conditions. Ontario Highway Systems are used for the empirical investigations. The major steps are:  Review the existing pavement distress database (PMS-2) of MTO;  Identify and partition pavement sections based on their material properties, layer thickness, traffic, climatic conditions, and construction and rehabilitation history;  Develop the calibration database including all input data of traffic pattern, vehicle classifications, traffic growth factor, climate data for proximate weather stations, material properties, and layer information;  Perform pavement analysis for the selected sections in the calibration database;  Calibrate the distress models.

The calibration of database is developed in the Microsoft Access environment. Pavement analysis is conducted by using the latest MEPDG package DARWin-ME that has only become recently available for public use.

There are plenty of issues regarding local calibration of the MEPDG models requiring special attentions. However, this study mainly focuses on two major aspects: the database development, and local calibration. Due to data limitation, only flexible pavement is considered in the database development. In this study of the local calibration, only certain distress models

(International Roughness Index (IRI), Rutting and Alligator cracking) are analyzed.

Chapter 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter presents a comprehensive review of relevant literature. Items covered include the basic concepts of MEPDG, design process of MEPDG, general and local calibration of MEPDG, and different types of distress models.

2.1 Historical Development of Pavement Design Methods
At the very starting stage of pavement design and analysis, the design was based on empirical design approach generated from the results of experiments or experience. The first empirical methods for flexible pavement design were found during mid-1920s when the first soil classifications were developed (Schwartz and Carvalho 2007).

One of the first published article was the Public Roads (PR) soil classification system (Hogentogler and Terzaghi 1929, after Huang 2004). In 1929, the California Highway Department developed a method using the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) strength test (Porter 1950; after Huang 2004). The CBR method related the material's CBR value to the required thickness to provide protection against subgrade shear failure. The thickness computed was defined for the standard crushed stone used in the definition of the CBR test. The CBR method was improved by U.S. Corps of Engineers (USCE) during the World War II and later became the most popular design method. In 1945 the Highway Research Board (HRB) modified the PR classification. Soils were grouped in 7 categories (A-1 to A-7) with indexes to differentiate soils 8

within each group. The classification was applied to estimate the sub-base quality and total pavement thicknesses.

In 1950s, pavement design methods were based on a limited amount of performance data acquired through road tests sponsored by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO). Based on the result of the road tests, the empirical design equations were developed and the AASHTO Interim Guide for the Design of Pavement Structures was published in 1972 (Dzotepe and Ksaibati 2011).

These equations are developed using regression analysis from test results of pavement serviceability, supporting value of the sub-grade, quantity of the predicted traffic, quality of the construction materials, and climate. The Interim Guide is developed mainly based on the AASHO road tests with limited range of design parameters. They include only one climate, one sub-grade, two years duration, limited cross sections and 1950s materials, traffic volumes, specifications, and construction methods (AASHTO 2008). Consequently, covering some improvements within the material input parameters and design reliability, this guide is updated in 1986 and 1993.

However, the materials, climate and traffic of highways are different for different locations. Therefore, the empirical design equations in those design guides are inevitably used in an extrapolative manner, resulting in less accurate and also less precise prediction of pavement performance. To address this limitation and also to utilize mechanistic-based models and databases relevant to the current state of knowledge of highway performance, AASHTO initiated in the mid 1990s further investigation and research, aiming to develop a new pavement 9

design guide. Finally, AASHTO and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) developed the MEPDG under NCHRP Project 1-37A in 2004 (Timm et al. 2010; Hall et al. 2010).

The mechanistic-empirical method represents one step forward from the previous empirical methods. In this mechanistic approach, a mathematical model is used to define the relationship between different structural response (stresses, strains and deflection) and the physical consequences. According to Flintsch and McGhee, the "mechanistic­empirical (M-E)

procedures use pavement models based on the mechanics of materials to predict pavement responses (deflections, strains, and stresses) and empirically based transfer functions to estimate distress initiation and development based on these responses" (Flintsch and McGhee 2009). Figure 2.1 presents the basic flow chart of the M-E design process. The design procedures of the MEPDG are shown in Figure 2.2.

The MEPDG manual and associated software provide a design and analysis procedure based on engineering mechanics. More importantly, the design equations are also validated with wideranged performance data of both test roads and in-service roads, providing with distress models for predicting the structural and functional performance of various types of flexible and rigid pavements. Using input of traffic, climate and materials data, these models can be used to more accurately analyze and predict the damage of the pavement sections. As a result, more reliable and economic design can be achieved.

Moreover, an implementation of the mechanistic­empirical pavement analysis and design methodology is expected to affect pavement management practices and, in particular, pavement condition data collection.

2.2 MEPDG Software
The MEPDG Software is developed as a part of NCHRP project by AASHTO with NCHRP

and MEPDG Version 1.1 is available. It mechanistically calculates pavement responses (stresses, strains, and deflections) and empirically correlates damage over time to the pavement distresses. At design stage, the software use an iterative process with inputs in trial design, estimating damage and key distress over design life and then design is verified against the performance criteria with a desired level of reliability. To meet the specified performance and reliability requirements, the initial design may have to be modified as per requirement. For this reason, in this approach, a selected trail design is performed first to determine whether it meets the criteria of specified performance. The generalized basic steps for the MEPDG are shown in Table 2.1.

DARWin-ME1.0 is the next generation of AASHTOWare pavement design software which builds upon the research grade MEPDG software. It is intended to support AASHTO's interim MEPDG manual of practice. The development of this software product was undertaken by AASHTO. This software greatly simplifies the pavement design and analysis methodology described in the AASHTO MEPDG Manual of Practice. DARWin-ME also has additional interface features for importing data from third party software. Key components of the software can be identified in Figure 2.3

material conditions)
2. Defining the pavement layer arrangement for Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) and other

underlying material properties
3. Setting the criteria of the different distress models for performance at acceptable

level at the end of the design period
4. Setting the desired level of reliability for the above performance criteria 5. Selecting hierarchical input of traffic data, material properties, climatic data and

pavement layer structural properties for desired level of accuracy
6. Computing the structural responses (stress, strain, deformation) for each damage

7.

8. Predicting distresses (cracking, rutting) for a certain period using the calibrated

mechanistic-empirical performance models
9. Predicting the smoothness as a function of the initial IRI, distresses over time, and

site factors at the end of each month.
10. Evaluating the expected performance of the trial design at the given reliability level

for adequacy.
11. Modifying the design repeating the process, if the performance criteria are not met.

13

Following the basic steps of MEPDG, each DARWin-ME pavement design project, whether new construction, an overlay, restoration, uses an iterative process. Three major basic steps are: a. Create a trial design for project. b. Run DARWin-ME to predict the key distresses and smoothness for trial design. c. Review the predicted performance of trial design against the performance criteria and modify trial design as needed until a feasible design is produced that satisfies the performance criteria. This step may require several runs of DARWin-ME.

Pavement design and analysis using DARWin-ME requires the inputs of general project information, performance criteria, pavement layers and materials, traffic, climate, pavement design features/properties, rehabilitation information (if applicable), analysis calibration factors, Sensitivity inputs and Optimization inputs.

DARWin-ME includes a database option that enables enterprise operation. It can  Archive projects: Any valid DARWin-ME project can be stored in its entirety in the database  Create data libraries: Individual material or other analysis objects, such as traffic and climate, can be stored and retrieved by users  Search archived projects: Any archived DARWin-ME project can be searched in the database  Compare project inputs: Project inputs can be compared with data libraries.

DARWin-ME uses a three-level hierarchical input scheme for most of the input parameters related to traffic, material, and pavement condition. The following defines each hierarchical input level:  Input Level 1 ­ Input parameter is measured directly; it is site or project specific value. This level represents the greatest knowledge about the input parameter for a specific project but has the highest testing and data collection costs to determine the input value.  Input Level 2 ­ Input parameter is estimated from correlations or regression equations. In other words, the input value is calculated from other site specific data 15

or parameters that are less costly to measure. Input level 2 may also represent measured regional values that are not project-specific.  Input Level 3 ­ Input parameter is based on "best-estimated" or default values. Level 3 inputs are based on national or regional default values ­ the median value from a group of data with similar characteristics.

The DARWin-ME design process contains more than 85 total inputs with 13 or more general information, 30 or more traffic information, 16 or more layer properties , 16 structural properties (per layer), and more than 1000 weather station.. This can be compared with the 1993 AASHTO Guide, which contains 5 inputs for flexible pavement and 10 inputs for rigid pavements (AASHTO 2008). The software currently uses 1000 or more weather stations.

DARWin-ME outputs reports in two formats: PDF and Excel. The data contained in these reports include input summary, climate summary, design pass/fail checks, material properties summary, distress and smoothness prediction summary and charts. The output of the analysis software is a prediction of the distresses and smoothness against set reliability targets and so it is anticipated that a more reliable design will be created and there will no longer be a dependence on extrapolation of empirical relationships. It will also allow for calibration nationally, regionally, or to local performance data for materials, climate, and traffic.

16

2.3 MEPDG Performance Indicators
One of the important improvements of the MEPDG in comparison with the empirical design approaches is that the MEPDG estimates damage accumulation and hence predicts pavement performance over the whole service life of the pavement section. These performance predictions consist of pavement distresses and ride quality. For flexible pavement the following performance prediction indicators are considered in the MEPDG (Velasquez et al. 2009):     

Alligator cracking Transverse cracking Longitudinal cracking Rutting IRI

Alligator Fatigue (bottom up) cracking This is commonly referred to as "bottom-up" or "classical" fatigue cracking. This cracking is one of the major distress types occurring in flexible pavement systems. Tensile and shear stresses developed at the bottom of the HMA layer due to repeated traffic loads and structural stability of the pavement layer becomes unsteady. Fatigue cracks starts at points where the critical tensile strains and stresses occur. Stiffer mixtures or thin layers are more likely to exhibit bottom-up fatigue cracking problems, which makes it a problem often aggravated by cold weather. Soft layers placed immediately below the asphalt concrete layer increase the tensile strain magnitude at the bottom of the asphalt concrete and consequently increase the possibility of fatigue crack development. After the damage is initiated at the critical location, these cracks propagate along with accumulative traffic loading. 17

A number of reasons are associated with an increase in alligator cracking. Mostly, higher wheel loads and tire pressures, inadequate HMA layers for the magnitude and repetitions of the loading, and weakness in base layers resulting from high moisture contents, soft spots, or poor compaction are the common reasons.

The cracks which form a network of multisided (polygon) blocks resemble the skin of an alligator. The block size can range from a few millimeters to about a meter. The block size is indicative of the level (depth) at which failure is taking place.

Longitudinal (top down) cracking In thick pavements, cracks are most likely to initiate from the top in localized areas of high tensile stresses resulting from a tire-pavement interaction and asphalt binder aging (Myersr et al. 2001). This type of surface-initiated longitudinal wheel-path cracking is known as top-down or surface down cracking. The initiation of longitudinal surface cracks is advanced by the presence of high vertical and lateral stresses induced under radial truck tires at the pavement's surface. In most instances, the aging of the HMA layer tends to create stiffness in the layer, which worsens the effect. A shearing effect is induced in the layer from the tire contact pressure which combines with the tension from the loading resulting in cracking. This distress is calculated as feet of cracking per mile or m/km.

18

Rutting Generally, permanent deformation results in any of a pavement's layers or subgrade due to consolidation or lateral movement of the materials under traffic and environmental loadings. Rutting refers to vertical surface depression in the wheel-path. Pavement uplift (shearing) may occur along the sides of the rut.

There are two basic types of rutting: mix rutting and subgrade rutting. Mix rutting occurs when the subgrade does not rut yet the pavement surface exhibits wheel-path depressions as a result of compaction or mix design problems. Subgrade rutting occurs when the subgrade exhibits wheel-path depressions due to loading. In the latter case, the pavement settles into the subgrade ruts causing surface depressions in the wheel path. Rutting damage due to different axle configurations is approximately proportional to the number of axles within an axle group. In other words, rutting damage is proportional to the gross weight of the axle group or truck, with multiple axles causing slightly less damage than a combination of smaller axle groups, for the same load carried (Chatti 2009).

Rutting is computed in the MEPDG in inches or millimeters and appears as a permanent deformation occurring along the wheel paths. This depression could be as a result of traffic loading, poor compaction of any of the layers during construction stage, or the shearing of the pavement caused by the traffic wheel loading (AASHTO 2008).

Thermal cracking Cracks that are perpendicular to the pavement's centreline or lay down direction are normally known as thermal cracks, or transverse cracks. They tend to appear on the surface. Mainly, the 19

shrinkage of the HMA surface due to low temperatures or seasonal/daily temperature differences, asphalt binder hardening is considered as major reason for this type of cracking. Transverse cracking is computed as feet of cracking per mile or meter/ kilometer.

Smoothness/IRI Pavement roughness is generally defined as an expression of irregularities in the pavement surface that adversely affect the ride quality of a vehicle. Developed by the World Bank in the 1980s (WSDOT 2005), the IRI is used to define a characteristic of the longitudinal profile of a travelled wheel-track and constitutes a standardized roughness measurement. It is used to determine the functional serviceability of the pavement design. The commonly recommended units are meters per kilometer (m/km) or millimeters per meter (mm/m). The IRI is based on the average rectified slope (ARS), which is a filtered ratio of a standard vehicle's accumulated suspension motion (in mm, inches, etc.) divided by the distance travelled by the vehicle during the measurement (km, mi, etc.). IRI is then equal to ARS multiplied by 1,000 (WSDOT 2005). The MEPDG predicts the IRI by means of an empirical function combining the other performance indicators.

The results obtained for the MEPDG analysis for the performance indicators is generally verified against the user-specified design criteria or threshold limits. These threshold limits can be nationally or locally established by the agencies. . The comparison is to help determine how well the particular pavement will perform throughout its design life. The general criteria set is that interstate projects require more stringent design or thresholds values when compared with secondary and primary roads. Evaluating the specified threshold limits against the performance prediction outputs from the design helps establish the acceptability or adjustment of the trial 20

design. During the design analysis of the pavement, the point where the performance indicators exceed the specified ranges during the design life, the pavement would need reconstruction or rehabilitation. Table 2.2 shows the recommended design criteria limits provided by the MEPDG. However, these values are adjusted based on different local conditions.

Table 2.2 Recommended Threshold Design Values for Flexible Pavements (AASHTO 2008)
Performance Criteria Alligator Cracking (HMA) Recommended Maximum Value Interstate: 10% lane area Secondary: 35% lane area Primary: 20% lane area Transverse Cracking (HMA) Interstate: 500 ft/mi Secondary: 700 ft/mile Primary: 700 ft/mile Rutting (HMA) Interstate: 0.40 in Others: (<45mph): 0.65 in Primary: 0.50 in IRI (All Pavements) Interstate: 160 in/mi Secondary: 200 in/mi Primary: 200 in/mi

In MEPDG, the critical stress or strain values obtained from the structural response model are converted to incremental distresses, either in absolute terms, such as in rut depth calculation, or in terms of a damage index in fatigue cracking. The cumulative damage is converted to physical cracking using calibrated distress prediction models.

21

Although, different researches are carried out to predict the pavement life by predicting the above mentioned distresses, it still is not possible to make accurate and precise prediction of pavement life. This becomes very difficult due to the complexity in predicting many of the factors that influence the pavement performance. It is challenging to predict infrequent hot summers, cold winters, wet springs etc. Furthermore, traffic forecasts are also unreliable for different road zone or area and there is a large disparity in the local characteristics of pavement materials and structures. Figure 2.4 illustrates the complexity of the performance prediction problem. For these reasons, an important aspect is to evaluate the performance prediction models, re-calibration of the performance prediction models for the local characteristics. To calibrate these models a number of researches are conducted (Velasquez et al. 2009; Hall et al. 2010; Hoegh et al. 2010; and Darter et al. 2005) for different locations by different agencies.

Figure 2.4: Factors affecting Pavement Performance (NCP 2010)

2.4 MEPDG Distress Models for Flexible Pavements
Pavement distress or above mentioned performance indicators are expected to be affected by several parameters. The equations used to predict the performance indicators are known as 22

distress models. Different models are used for different types of distresses by different agencies which are discussed below.

Fatigue Cracking (Top down and Bottom Up) Models Fatigue damage of pavements is a very complex process affected by pavement structural capacity, vehicle characteristics, mix properties, climatic effects, and time. Pavement structural capacity and the vehicle's characteristics affect the stress level at the bottom of the HMA layer and accordingly affect the fatigue life of the pavement (Pell and Copper 1975; Chatti et al. 1995; Simmons and Seaman 2000).

Fatigue cracking is directly related to the strain development in the HMA layer and it starts when the tensile strains exceed a threshold value of the HMA. Numbers of models are developed to characterize the fatigue of flexible pavements. Some of these models are developed to best suit specific characteristics of a particular institute, and some are just the output of an extensive laboratory testing. The number of repetitions to fatigue cracking is expressed by the following equation: ( ) Where: = Number of repetitions to fatigue cracking; = Modulus of HMA = tensile strain at critical locations Laboratory regression coefficient ( ) (1)

23

Or, Similarly the above equation (1) can also be expressed as follows: ( ) Where, k1, k2, k3= Laboratory regression coefficients C = Laboratory to field adjustment factor ( ) (2)

The most commonly used model form to predict the number of load repetitions to fatigue cracking is a function of the tensile strain and mix stiffness (modulus). The critical locations of the tensile strains may either be at the surface (result in top-down cracking) or at the bottom of the asphaltic layer (result in bottom-up cracking).

Some of these models were developed to best suit specific characteristics of a particular institute, and some were just the output of an extensive laboratory testing. Many other fatigue cracking models available in literature are listed in Table 2.3.

Rutting Models: Vertical compressive strains on the top of subgrade of asphalt pavement are important pavement response to predict the potential subgrade rutting in HMA pavements. Several rutting models are developed to relate the asphalt modulus and/or the measured strains to the number of load repetitions to pavement failure. Most of the rutting failure models take the following form: ( ) Where, Nd = number of load repetitions; (3)

Thermal Cracking Models The procedure requires the characterization of the HMA mix in an indirect tensile mode to measure the creep compliance at one or three temperatures depending on the level of analysis. Thermal fracture analysis in the MEPDG is based on the visco-elastic properties of the asphalt mixture.

The thermal cracking model is an enhanced version of the approach originally developed under the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) A-005 research contract. The amount of crack propagation induced by a given thermal cooling cycle is predicted using the Paris law of crack propagation.

C = A(K)n

The degree of cracking is predicted by the MEPDG using an assumed relationship between the probability distribution of the log of the crack depth to HMA-layer thickness ratio and the percent of cracking. The following equation shows the expression used to determine the extent of thermal cracking (AASHTO. 2008). TC= td Log (Cd/H HMA)] Where, TC = Observed amount of thermal cracking, ft/mi, 29 (5)

IRI Models Distresses predicted by the mechanistic-empirical models, such as fatigue cracking, permanent deformation and thermal cracking are correlated to smoothness. In addition the smoothness model optionally considers other distresses, such as potholes, longitudinal cracking outside the wheel path, and block cracking if there is potential of occurrence.

The design premise included in the MEPDG for predicting smoothness degradation is that the occurrence of surface distress will result in increased roughness (increasing IRI value), or in other words, a reduction in smoothness. (AASHTO 2008).

2.5 Calibration of MEPDG Distress Models: Global Calibration
Calibration is a systematic process to eliminate any bias and minimize the residual errors between observed or measured results from the real world (e.g., the measured mean rut depth in a pavement section) and predicted results from the model (e.g., predicted mean rut depth from a permanent deformation model). This is accomplished by modifying empirical calibration parameters or transfer functions in the model to minimize the differences between the predicted and observed results.

These calibration parameters are necessary to compensate for model simplification and limitations in simulating actual pavement and material behavior.

The primary objective of model calibration is to reduce bias. A biased model will consistently produce either over-designed or under-designed pavements, both of which have important cost consequences. The secondary objective of calibration is to increase precision of the model predictions.

32

A model that lacks precision is undesirable because it leads to inconsistency in design effectiveness including some premature failures. As part of the calibration process, predicted distress is compared against measured distress and appropriate calibration adjustment factors are applied to eliminate significant bias and maximize precision in the model predictions.The MEPDG combines empirical procedures with mechanistic procedures. In MEPDG, calibration is defined to reduce the the total error between the measured and predicted distresses by varying the appropriate model coefficients. In global calibration process, generally three important steps are followed (Dzotepe and Ksaibati 2010):

Step One: perform verification runs on pavement sections using the calibration factors from the national calibration effort.

Step Two: This involves calibrating the model coefficients to eliminate bias and reduce standard error between the predicted and measured distresses. Once this is accomplished and the standard error is within the acceptable level set by the user, the validation process is advanced.

Step Three: Validation, the third step, is used to check if the models are reasonable for performance predictions. The validation process determines if the factors are adequate and appropriate for the construction, materials, climate, traffic and other conditions that may be encountered within the system. This is done by selecting a number of independent pavement sections that were not used in the local calibration effort and testing those. Figure 2.5 shows the framework of the global calibration of distress models. 33

Figure 2.5: Framework for Global Calibration of MEPDG Distress models (Xiao et al. 2010)

In the M-E design procedures for flexible pavements, the primary transfer functions are those that relate (a) maximum tensile strain in the HMA surface layer to fatigue cracking and (b) compressive strain at the top of the subgrade layer to rutting at the surface. These functions, called fatigue and rutting equations, are derived from statistically based correlations of pavement condition with observed different laboratory specimen performance, full-scale road test experiments or by both methods.

Fatigue Cracking Models: Appendix II-1 of Guide for Mechanistic-Empirical Design of New and Rehabilitated Pavement Structures (NCHRP 2004) analysed the calibration of these fatigue cracking models for flexible pavements. That study focused on the selection, development, of calibration and validation 34

aspects of the fatigue cracking models selected for the design guide. Both types of fatigue cracking (bottom up and top down) are discussed separately. This study mainly discussed about two widely used fatigue models (AI and Shell method) and evaluated for inclusion in the design guide. For calibration, each model is evaluated based on the data collected from the LTPP database.

Fatigue cracking prediction is normally based on the classic Miner's rule for cumulative damage for metallic materials (Yang 1993). The damage is generally calculated as the ratio of the predicted number of traffic repetitions to the allowable number of load repetitions (to some failure level) as shown in equation 8. Theoretically, fatigue cracking should occur at an accumulated damage value of 1. If a normal distribution is assumed for the damage ratio calculated, the percentage of area cracked can be computed and checked with field performance (NCHRP 2004). Thus, (8) 

where, D = damage. T = total number of periods. ni = actual traffic for period i. Ni = allowable failure repetitions under conditions prevailing in period i.

35

The fatigue-cracking model, which calculates the number of cycles to failure is only expressing the stage of fatigue cracking described as the crack initiation stage. The second stage, or vertical crack propagation stage, is accounted for in these models by using the field adjustment factor. Other models in the literature use two different equations to express each stage of the fatigue cracking.

In calibration of the models (NCHRP 2004), two types of controlled loading are generally applied for fatigue characterization: constant stress and constant strain in the laboratory. In constant stress (load) testing, the applied stress during the fatigue testing remains constant. As the repetitive load causes damage in the test specimen, the stiffness of the mix is decreased due to the micro cracking observed. This, in turn, leads to an increase in tensile strain with load repetitions. In the constant strain test, the strain remains constant with the number of repetitions. Because of specimen damage due to the repetitive loading; the stress must be reduced to obtain the same strain. This leads to a reduced stiffness as a function of repetitions. The constant stress type of loading is generally considered applicable to thick asphalt pavement layers usually more than 8 inches. The constant strain type of loading is considered more applicable to thin asphalt pavement layers usually less than 2 inches. However, for intermediate thicknesses, fatigue life is generally governed by a situation that is a combination of constant stress and constant strain. The Shell Oil Co. has developed fatigue damage prediction equations for the two major forms of laboratory fatigue testing: for constant stress and constant strain, since the known impact between stress states and damage mechanism for different thicknesses of asphalt layers. In this model, K1 value in the equations is replaced by the K1 value which represents the K1 value for the constant stress situation.

36

For Constant Strain:

Nf =13909Af K1t)5(E-1.8)

(9)

For Constant Stress:

Nf =Af K1t)5(E-1.4)

(10)

Taking the ratio of the two above equations results in the following relationship (NCHRP, 2004): (11) where, F = the ratio between the constant strain and constant stress and is a function of the modulus (E) of asphalt layer

The F values are determined for the two extreme conditions: constant strain (thickness <= 2 inch) and constant stress situation (thickness => 8 inch). In order to have a continuous function between constant strain and stress conditions, it is assumed that a sigmoidal relationship, between the two F conditions and all intermediate thickness (2 inches to 8 inches), would be applicable.

On the other hand, the AI's fatigue equation is based upon modifications to constant stress laboratory fatigue criteria. The number of load repetitions to failure is expressed in the same mathematical form as the Shell Oil model and can be expressed as (NCHRP 2004):

where, C = 10M ; and 37

Vb = effective binder content (%). Va = air voids (%)

Comparing the Shell Oil model to the MS-1 (AI) model, it is found that both models are exactly the same form. However, the coefficients are less for the MS-1 model compared to the Shell Oil. This would be reasonable to accept because the Shell Oil relationships are based upon laboratory testing while the MS-1 equation (derived from NCHRP 1-10) was heavily based upon actual field calibration studies.

In Appendix II-1 (NCHRP 2004), the asphalt concrete mix fatigue-cracking models (both bottom-up cracking and top-down cracking) were calibrated following the process noted below: a) Calibration (performance) data is collected from the LTPP database for each field section. b) Simulation (predictive) runs are done using the 2002 design guide software and using a different set of calibration coefficients in the number of load repetition model. c) The predicted damage from each calibration coefficient combination is compared to the measured cracking observed in the field. The coefficient combination with the least scatter of the data and the correct trends is selected. d) The predicted damage is correlated to the measured cracking in the field by minimizing the square of the errors.

38

The calibration data collection is done at the same time for both types of fatigue cracking as the same sections were used for both bottom-up and top-down cracking calibration.

2.6 Current Practice of Local Calibration
Pavement performance prediction models contained in the current MEPDG were calibrated primarily using data from the LTPP. Due to the possible differences between `national' and `local' conditions ­ including climate, material properties, traffic patterns, construction and maintenance activities ­ pavement performance predicted by the MEPDG should be compared to and verified against local experience. Now-a-days, different states are reporting either a partial or full calibration of the MEPDG on a local level. All performance indicator prediction models in the MEPDG were calibrated to observed field performance from a representative sample of pavement test sites located throughout North America. These models are defined as being globally calibrated. Data from the LTPP test sections were used extensively in the global calibration process, because of their consistency in the monitored data over time and the diversity of test sections spread throughout North America. Other experimental test sections, such as Minnesota Road (MnRoad) and Vandalia, were also included in the global calibration process.

Ali and Tayabji (1998) evaluated and calibrated MEPDG performance models using the LTPP data for specific loading and environmental conditions of the selected pavements. The predicted performances are compared with actual fatigue cracking and rutting observed in these pavements. Although more data are required to arrive at a more conclusive evaluation, fatigue

39

cracking models appeared to be consistent with observations, whereas rutting models showed poor agreement with the observed rutting.

Schram and Abdelrahman (2006) used Roads Pavement Management System data of Nebraska to calibrate two smoothness models in the Design Guide at the local project level. The data set is categorized by annual daily truck traffic and surface layer thickness. From the study results, it is revealed that that project-level calibrations reduced default model prediction error by nearly twice that of network-level calibration. This study offers a window into the accuracy that can be achieved with local focus calibrations of design guide prediction models.

Moulthrop and Quintus (2007) calibrated MEPDG distress transfer functions for flexible and semi-rigid pavements HMA overlays constructed in Montana. Global calibration coefficients included in Version 0.9 of the MEPDG were used initially to predict the distresses and smoothness of the Montana calibration refinement test sections to determine any prediction model bias. Material test data together with historical traffic and climatic data are used to predict rutting and fatigue cracking in the HMA layer and rutting in the unbound layers. The results show that fatigue cracking (bottom up) model is reasonable, a local calibration factor for predicting thermal cracking is developed, but for top-down fatigue cracking model no consistent trend in the predictions is not identified to reduce bias and standard error.

Kang and Adams (2007) calibrated two important calibration factors (longitudinal and alligator fatigue cracking models). Pavement performance data are collected to manage the calibration data from state transportation agencies in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Calibration factors are then derived by minimizing the differences between observed and predicted pavement 40

performance. The pavement performance field data in Wisconsin are collected for calibration initially, and the distresses predicted with these calibration factors are compared to pavement field performance in the other states. These calibrated models in the MEPDG assure the reliable prediction of pavement distress, such as longitudinal and alligator cracks. The results of this study are shown in Table 2.8.

Velasquez et al.(2009) analyzed the performance prediction and evaluated of different types of flexible and rigid pavements for local conditions. To achieve these objectives, the MnDOT and LRRB initiated a study "Implementation of the MEPDG for New and Rehabilitated Pavement Structures for Design of Concrete and Asphalt Pavements in Minnesota." Performance prediction models of the latest version of the MEPDG are evaluated and modified or 41

recalibrated to reduce bias and error in performance prediction for Minnesota conditions. The performance models: rutting, alligator cracking, transverse cracking and IRI are investigated. The results show that local adaptation for Minnesota conditions require modification of the MEPDG rutting model for base and subgrade, as well as modification of the coefficients for the MEPDG fatigue cracking model and thermal cracking for flexible pavements. However, the use of the longitudinal cracking model is not recommended for adaptation, the IRI model could not be locally calibrated.

Siraj et al (2009) verified the accuracy of the predicted performance from the MEPDG software for the state of New Jersey for level 2 and level 3 inputs. In this study the MEPDG distress models for rutting, alligator cracking, longitudinal cracking, thermal cracking, and roughness (IRI) are verified. In this verification, nine LTPP and sixteen non-LTPP sections in the state of New Jersey are evaluated. The level 3 material input and level 2 traffic input are used during the analysis. The M-EPDG version 1.0 software is used for analysis. The input data and measured field performance data are collected from multiple sources. Form the analysis it is found that the average difference between measured rutting and the average predicted asphalt concrete layer rutting is statistically insignificant at 95% confidence level. The measured longitudinal cracking, thermal cracking and roughness (IRI) are found statistically similar to the predicted values. In addition the difference between measured and predicted alligator cracking is reasonable considering the error of field measured data, and prediction error due to level 3 material input.

Hoegh et al. (2010) conducted local calibration of rutting model using time history rutting performance data for pavement sections at the MnDOT full-scale pavement research facility. In this study, detailed comparison of the predicted total rutting, asphalt layer rutting, and measured 42

rutting is shown. Here, the MEPDG inputs that closely represent the asphalt MnRoad sections, are obtained as first step of methodology. Then the MEPDG software for flexible test sections are run to obtain predicted rutting. Predicted and measured rutting for asphalt test sections are compared to recalibrate rutting model of the MEPDG by adjusting the parameters by reducing error between predicted and measured performance. The paper also explains the reasons for not finding the conventional MEPDG model calibration as feasible and recommends a modification of the rutting model. Finally, the results show that the locally calibrated models are less biased than the predictions using the nationally calibrated rutting models.

Hall et al. (2010) summarized the initial local calibration of flexible pavement models in the MEPDG for Arkansas. Pavement performance prediction models are calibrated using data from the LTPP. In this study, the states are reporting either a partial or full calibration of the MEPDG on a local level because of the potential differences between `national' and `local' conditions. For the current MEPDG, predicted distresses did not accurately reflect measured distresses, particularly for longitudinal and transverse cracking. However, due to the lack of measured transverse cracking, the transverse cracking model is not calibrated. Calibration coefficients are optimized for the alligator cracking and longitudinal cracking models minimizing the sum of standard error. It is found that the alligator cracking and longitudinal cracking models are improved by calibration. Finally, the procedure for local calibration of the MEPDG using LTPP and PMS data in Arkansas is established.

2.7 Summary
In this chapter, the MEPDG, the basis of DARWin-ME software, distress models and requirement issue for local calibration are discussed. The materials, climate and traffic of highways are different for different locations. For these reasons, the previous empirical generalized methods are considered as less accurate and also less precise in predicting the performance of pavement. Now, the important aspect is to evaluate the performance prediction models, re-calibration of the performance prediction models for Ontario local conditions. Based on the described basic concepts, the analysis framework and input data requirements can be developed.

44

Chapter 3 CALIBRATION DATABASE DEVELOPMENT
This chapter discusses the requirement and development of the local calibration database. The detailed input requirements and their level of accuracy are discussed step by step. The method of selecting the road section cycles is also discussed. The condition rating process for distresses and IRI practiced in Ontario is shown accordingly. Finally a hierarchical framework of input data along with level of accuracy is developed for the analysis.

3.1 Data Requirement for Local Calibration
Local calibration is a process of fitting the observed pavement distress data against the predicted pavement damage from the MEPDG design software outputs. Therefore, data required for the local calibration basically are of two types: observed distress data (or field pavement condition data) and data of corresponding pavement distress predictions. For the latter, they are also the input data for pavement analysis and design.

As discussed in Chapter 1, the observed pavement distress data are retrieved from the MTO's PMS system. However, the pavement condition data cannot be used directly without any modification for the local calibration. Screening, selection and conversion are necessary steps before they can be integrated into the calibration database. These steps are explained in detail in Section 3.3 and 3.4.

The prototype computational software used to be available online and free for evaluation. However, this has been terminated since September 2011. Pavement engineers who would like to use MEPDG for pavement design are suggested to use DARWin-ME. DARWin-ME is the AASHTOWare pavement design software that builds upon the MEPDG, and expands and improves the features in the prototype software. DARWin-ME supports AASHTO's MEPDG, Interim Edition: A Manual of Practice (AASHTO 2011). In this study, DARWin-ME is used for pavement analysis, with the understanding that it will most likely be used for day-to-day pavement design in future. Therefore, the following discussions on the input requirement for pavement analysis and design are based on DARWIN-ME. The pavement distress models to be locally calibrated will then be those prescribed in the AASHTO Manual of Practice. In

DARWinME, three major categories of the input variables for the evaluation of pavement distresses are required. These are i) Traffic data ii) Climate data iii) Properties of Materials/ Structure

3.2 Accuracy Levels of Input Data
DARWin-ME allows input data at three levels depending on the importance of the project and the availability of resources (AASHTO 2011), as described below. Level 1: inputs generally are the most accurate that a certain type of data can be. For example, site-specific and laboratory data or results of actual field testing are considered as Level 1 input. Generally, for material properties, laboratory test values are used for 46

this level (e.g., dynamic modulus master curve for asphalt concrete, nonlinear resilient modulus for unbound materials). For traffic, site specific traffic data (AADTT, lane number, growth factor, etc.) are required.

Level 2: input parameters are estimated from mathematical correlations or regression equations. In some cases, the input value is calculated or estimated from other site specific data (or taken from similar properties). Regional values are also used as level 2 input, whenever project or site specific values are not available. For material properties, inputs can be obtained through empirical correlations with other parameters (e.g., resilient modulus estimated from CBR values). For traffic, region specific data (axle configuration, truck vehicle classification, etc.) are used for analysis.

Level 3: input parameters are the least accurate. They are normally default values or based on best estimates. Generally, national level or regional level values are used.

In DARWin-ME, normally three levels of accuracy are incorporated in the input for traffic and materials. The climate data, however, is fixed and does not have a hierarchical input level. It is input from a climate database and installed in the software.

These three levels of accuracy provide design engineers with convenience and flexibility in practical pavement designs. Depending on the actual need and resources available, the design engineers shall decide how accurate the design input data should be. The recently published AASHTO guide for local calibration (AASHTO 2010) pointed out the importance of the selection of hierarchical input level for the inputs. Highest accuracy levels in the LTPP database 47

were used for the global calibration and recalibration under NCHRP 1-37A (completed in 2004) and 1-40D (completed in 2006), respectively. However, the local calibration guide (AASHTO 2010) seemed to suggest using the same accuracy levels for local calibration as the agency would use for future design. This may be inefficient because the benefits from extra effort for obtaining more accurate input data for local calibration could easily outweigh the efforts made for a single design. The main objective of local calibration is to reduce the bias and variability of the performance prediction models. For this purpose, the highest levels of input, which are not necessarily Level 1, should be used and are used in this study.

3.3 Selection of Pavement Sections
A guiding principle for the selection of pavement sections is efficiency of local calibration, which means a balance between the efforts of data collection and benefits from local calibration in terms of eliminating biases and maximizing precision. Two questions need to be answered: how many test pavement sections (i.e., sample size) should be used and which sections should be used? The AASHTO guide for local calibration (AASHTO 2010) recommends two statistical equations to determine the sample size. Based on the variability of the LTPP data, the guide provides minimum numbers of test sections for each distress, and they are no more than 30 section. The AASHTO guide also recommends the use of fractional factorial design to pick up test sections. This recommend is followed in this project.

As of the end of 2010, the historical pavement condition data stored in the MTO PMS2 database reached more than 30,000 section-years for the 1794 pavement sections. The pavement distress data cover the whole record period starting from 1985, when the PMS was first put in service in the MTO. During the period from 1985 to 2010, many pavement sections have undergone 48

several rehabilitation cycles. In this study, the sections with service life of more than 4 years are selected since the pavement performance curve with cycle length of less than 4 years will not capture the realistic trend of performance quality of that section.

Preliminarily, 5,555 pavement section cycles from PMS-2 are selected based on the quality of the performance curve of section cycle. The sections are selected considering all regions (east, west, south and north), highway types (King's highway or secondary), facility types (freeway, arterials, collectors), number of lanes (2,3, and 4 lanes), lengths of section and also quality of performance curves in terms of pavement condition index (PCI) and distress manifestation index (DMI). Based on the availability of rehabilitation history, detailed rehabilitation type, performance condition rating, and distress history the selection is further screened. Finally 101 section cycles from 66 road sections are selected for the empirical calibration. In addition, 46 road sections are selected for future validation of locally calibrated models. The purpose of the validation is to verify the calibrated predicted values and database. For these selected pavement sections, their design input data are then collected with assistance from MTO staff and verified to ensure the data is reliable. After all these data has been cross-verified, they are then combined to create a unified database for the use of local calibration.

3.4 Observed Distress and Smoothness Data
The MTO PMS2 follows a pavement performance condition rating standard (shown in Table 3.1) that is slightly different from the AASHTO condition evaluation manual. For each asphalt concrete pavement section, 14 types of surface distress ranging from raveling, flushing, to wheel-path rutting, distortion, and to various types of cracking are evaluated in terms of extent and severity at a scale from 0 to 5. Among the many cracking types, the wheel-path alligator 49

cracking is considered to the manifestation of fatigue cracking due to traffic loading (Bottom-up fatigue cracking), whereas the wheel-path longitudinal cracking corresponds to the top-down cracking predicted by the MEPDG model. The transverse cracking is considered to be mainly caused by thermal cracking. In PMS-2 the IRI values are not recorded before 1997, the IRI values are estimated for the section cycles starting in 1997 or before 1997 using the following equation: RCI = Max (0, Min (10, 8.5 ­ 3.02 x ln (IRI))) The initial rutting depth was not recorded in the PMS-2 before 1997. For this reason, a minimum initial rut depth of 4.0 mm (which is average initial rut depth of the available rut depth record after 1997 to onwards) are considered for those section cycles starting before 1997. For bottom up (alligator) cracking, field observed values are converted to extent of occurrence following manual for condition rating of flexible pavements (Chong et al 1989) which are shown in Table 3.1. In this study, the field condition ratings from PMS-2 are converted to extent of occurrence in percentage. Midpoint values are used for the ranges.

3.5 Major Inputs of DARWin-ME
The input data required for the DARWin-ME analysis are summarized and discussed step by step for traffic, climate and materials properties. The steps of input level are discussed below.

3.5.1 General Information In DARWin-ME, some general information including design life, existing pavement constructions date, pavement overlay construction date, traffic open date, and new construction or rehabilitation history are required. Site specific level 1 data are required for this stage. For analysis, site specific information is collected from Ontario PMS-2 database for each pavement section cycle. The design life is considered as the original cycle length of the pavement section for that certain cycle. All general information, traffic information, location information of all selected pavement section cycles are summarized in the database.

3.5.2 Traffic Data The DARWin-ME traffic inputs include traffic volume adjustment factors, axle load distribution factors and general traffic inputs. It uses the concept of load spectra for characterizing traffic. Each axle type (e.g., single, tandem) is divided in a series of load ranges. Vehicle class distributions, daily traffic volume, and axle load distributions define the number of repetitions of each axle load group at each load level. This software does not incorporate equivalent singleaxle loads (ESALs) as is the case in the current design guide, but instead were developed around axle load spectra. Full axle load spectra traffic inputs are used for estimating the magnitude, configuration, and frequency of traffic loads. The approach analyses the effects of actual traffic on pavement response and distress. 51

The site-specific traffic data are collected and if that is not possible, site-related, regional, or agency-wide traffic data (e.g. truck traffic classification) is substituted. The DARWin-ME software also includes default axle load spectra and other traffic parameters if no other sources of traffic data can be obtained. Throughout the analysis of traffic data in the DARWin-ME there are many elements used. Some of the major elements are as follows:

i. Truck Volume and Highway Parameters: Truck volume is calculated multiplying traffic (Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)) volume with the percentage of heavy trucks of FHWA class 4 or higher. The result is Average Annual Daily Truck Traffic (AADTT). ii. Number of lanes in the design direction: This presents the number of lanes present in the design direction. iii. Percent trucks in design lane: This defines the percentage of trucks in the design direction expected to use the design lane (typically the outer right lane). iv. Operational speed (kph): This defines the expected speed of traffic traveling in the design lane. v. Average axle width (m): This defines the distance in feet between two outside edges of an axle. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 2.59 meter. vi. Dual tire spacing (mm): This defines the transverse distance in inches between the centers of a dual tire. This value is calculated from WIM data measured over time by averaging the distance measured between the dual tires of a tandem, tridem, or quad axle for each truck class. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 305 mm. vii. Tire pressure (kPa): This defines the hot inflation pressure of tires in pounds per square inch. It is assumed that the hot inflation pressure equals the contact pressure and is 10% above cold inflation pressure. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 827.4 kPa. 52

viii. Tandem axle spacing (m): This defines the center-to-center longitudinal spacing in inches between two consecutive axles in a tandem configuration. This value is calculated using WIM data by averaging distance measured between the tandem axles for each truck class. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 1.31 meter. ix. Tridem axle spacing (m): This defines the center-to-center longitudinal spacing in inches between two consecutive axles in a tridem configuration. This value is calculated using WIM data by averaging distance measured between the tridem axles for each truck class. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 1.25 meter. x. Quad axle spacing (m): This defines the average distance in inches between two consecutive axles in a quad configuration. This value is calculated using WIM data by averaging distance measured between the quad axles for each truck class. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 1.25 meter. xi. Mean wheel location (mm): This defines the distance in inches from the outer edge of the wheel to the pavement marking. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 460 mm. xii. Traffic wander standard deviation (mm): This defines the divergence from average in inches of the lateral traffic wander. This standard deviation is used to estimate the number of axle load repetitions over a single point in a probabilistic manner for predicting distress and performance. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 254 mm. xiii. Design lane width (m): This defines the distance in feet between the lane marking on either side of the design lane. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 3.7 meter. xiv. Average spacing of short axles (m): This defines the average longitudinal spacing in feet of short axles. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 3.66 meter. xv. Average spacing of medium axles (m): This defines the average longitudinal spacing in feet of medium axles. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 4.57 meter. 53

xvi. Average spacing of long axles (m): This defines the average longitudinal spacing in feet of long axles. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 5.49 meter. xvii. Percent of trucks with short axles: This defines the percentage of trucks in design with short axles. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 33 percent. xviii. Percent of trucks with medium axles: This defines the percentage of trucks in your design with medium axles. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 33 percent. xix. Percent of trucks with long axles: This defines the percentage of trucks in your design with long axles. DARWin-ME provides a default value of 34 percent. xx. Monthly Traffic Volume Adjustment Factors: These factors are used to distribute the AADTT volume a year's time. Once the monthly traffic volume adjustment factors have been created, they are assumed to be the same for the design life. Monthly traffic volume adjustment factors are used if there is significant monthly variation in truck volumes that affect pavement performance. This variation is most likely due to seasonal traffic, such as in summer or winter xxi. Vehicle Classification Distribution: The software uses the FHWA scheme of classifying heavy vehicles. Ten different vehicle classes are used (classes 4 to 13). The subsequent three light vehicle classes (classes 1 to 3, motorcycle, passenger car, and pickup) are not used in the software. xxii. Hourly Traffic Volume Adjustment Factors: Hourly traffic adjustment factors are expressed as a percentage of the AADT volumes during each hour of the day. These factors apply to all vehicle classes and are constant throughout the design life of the pavement system. xxiii. Axle Load Distribution Factors: The distribution of the number of axles by load range is the definition of axle load spectra. An axle load spectrum distribution is referred to as 54

axle load distribution factors. The software allows different set of axle load distribution factors for each vehicle class and each month. xxiv. Traffic Growth Factors: Anticipation of truck volume growth after a road has opened is expressed in traffic growth factors. These factors are applied to individual vehicle classes. Axle load distributions are assumed to be constant with time and no growth factors are applied to them. The software also has no provision for reduction in truck volume. xxv. Number of Axles per Truck: For each class, the number of axles per truck by axle type is required. The axle type is single, tandem, tridem, and quad. The number of axles per truck has significant influence on the predicted pavement performance. xxvi. Lateral Traffic Wander: Lateral traffic wander is defined as a lateral distribution of truck tire imprints across the pavement. Traffic wander plays an important role in the prediction of distresses associated with rutting. Default values for traffic wander are recommended unless quality data are available on a regional or local basis. xxvii. Axle Configuration: The software allows two types of axle spacing. The first is axle spacing within the axle group, and it is defined as the average spacing between individual axles within the axle group (for example, the average spacing for all tandem axles for all vehicle types). Separate entries for tandem, tridem and quad axles are required. The second possibility is axle spacing between major axle groups. This is defined as the spacing between the steering axle and the first subsequent axle. Axle spacing between the major axle groups is required for short, medium, and long trucks. Axle configuration has a marginal effect on pavement performance predicted by the MEPDG, and is at the discretion of the user to pick default values or use measured values. 55

Traffic input data are usually entered for the base year (starting year of the cycle length). The base year is the year the pavement is expected to open to traffic. Within the software, there is a provision for future growth in truck volumes after the base year.

3.5.3 Climate data Local climate play very significant role in pavement performance. Change in local temperature, precipitation, season, and frost depth can considerably affect pavement performance. The MEPDG requires these inputs to be locally calibrated. As a result, these climate conditions are needed to be observed and correlated to pavement performance. The climate parameters can be obtained from weather stations close to the project location. The DARWin-ME software includes a library of weather data for approximately 800 weather stations throughout the U.S. and Canada. The climate inputs are used to predict moisture and temperature distributions inside the pavement structure. Asphalt concrete stiffness is sensitive to temperature variations and unbound material stiffness is sensitive to moisture variations. 61

For a specific location, where there are no weather data available, the Integrated Climatic Model (ICM) is able to create a virtual weather station by interpolating the climatic data from neighboring weather stations. To generate a virtual climate file for a project location, the longitude, latitude and the elevation of the project are to be selected. The software will then automatically find weather stations closest to the location of the project. The number of weather stations selected is used to create a virtual weather station for the project location. Multiple weather stations are normally used due to the possibility of missing data and errors in the database for a single station, which may cause the software to hang or crash in the climatic module. It is also recommended that the weather stations selected to create the virtual station have similar elevations, if possible, although temperatures are adjusted for elevation differences (AASHTO 2008). In areas of wide-range climatic differences, AASHTO recommends that highway agencies divide such areas into similar climatic zones (approximately the same ambient temperature and moisture) and then identify representative weather stations for each of these zones (AASHTO 2008).

Therefore, DARWin-ME models daily and seasonal fluctuations in the moisture and temperature profiles in the pavement structure brought about by changes in ground water table, precipitation/infiltration, freeze-thaw cycles, and other external factors. The Canadian climate DARWin-ME has option for verifying weather that performs quality checks of climate data for the station selected. "Verify Weather" allows DARWin-ME to check for the following: a. If the data value of an hourly record is within an acceptable range; 62

b. If the difference between the data values of two consecutive hourly records are within an acceptable range; c. If there are any missing or blank data in a record; and d. If an hourly record does not meet all the criteria mentioned above, the program displays an error or a warning message listed in the Error List Pane area.

Ontario's available station in DARWin-ME are summarized in the Appendix B. Table 3.8 presents climate inputs requirement for DARWin-ME. Table 3.9 presents climate inputs data and level used for analysis.

3.5.4 Material Properties The DARWin-ME requires the use of material properties of the pavement layers to create a mechanistic analysis of the pavement responses. With the implementation of the MEPDG underway, it is important to understand the performance of pavement materials under differing conditions.

In DARWin-ME, the material types that fall under the following general definitions can be defined as an asphalt layer:    HMA Dense Graded Open Graded Asphalt 64

     

Asphalt Stabilized Base Mixes Sand Asphalt Mixtures Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) Cold Mix Asphalt Central Plant Processed Cold In-Place Recycling

The key materials inputs required for asphalt concrete layers are:   Dynamic modulus of asphalt mixtures Rheological properties of asphalt binder (e.g. viscosity, penetration, complex modulus and phase angles)   Creep compliance and indirect tensile strength Mix related and other properties (e.g. effective binder content, air voids, heat capacity, thermal conductivity)

These inputs are required for predicting pavement responses, climatic analysis, asphalt aging as well as pavement performance. Table 3.10 presents material inputs requirement for asphalt concrete. Table 3.10 presents material inputs requirement for asphalt concrete. Table 3.11 presents material inputs used for asphalt concrete for the analysis.

3.6 Integration of the Calibration Database
The input data are compiled for all section cycles. From historical pavement data, all the performance data including section name, rout name, Route direction, station beginning mile, station end mile, evaluation year, DMI, pavement condition rating (PCR), ride comfort rating (RCR), riding comfort index (RCI), PCI, IRI, facility type for all distress (both extent and severity), functional class, lanes, length, width, AADT, percent of truck, annual ESAL, cumulative ESA, construction year, subgrade modulus, are collected and compiled in Microsoft Access for the selected section cycles using their unique section code. Other traffic data (axle configuration, vehicle class etc.) are also collected from local traffic office and compiled into Microsoft Access for the unique section code. Materials properties are collected from the contract document of the road sections and complied accordingly. Latitude, longitude and elevation for specific section are collected from google map and complied in to the data file.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, input data requirement for local calibration of pavement design models are discussed. The historical pavement performance data retrieved from the MTO PMS2 have been screened, selected and converted to the proper format for the use of local calibration. Based on the selected pavement sections, the input data required for pavement analysis and design in 71

DARWin-ME at different hierarchical level were also discussed. Depending upon the data availability, a proper input level of accuracy has been determined. Three major categories of input data (i.e., traffic, climate and materials) were described in detail. Finally, the pavement performance data and input data have been integrated to a Microsoft Access database.

Using the available input data, the pavement analysis is performed for the selected calibration sections. This will be discussed in the next chapter.

72

Chapter 4 RESULT ANALYSIS FOR LOCAL CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION
Based on available hierarchical input framework developed in chapter 3, the distresses of the selected sections are predicted using the DARWin-ME software. Finally using the software output and the observed distress, local calibration of distress models are carried out in this chapter. A validation is also carried out for the calibrated models using a separate validation data set.

4.1 DARWin-ME Output
At first all output of 101 section cycles are plotted and compared. A sample of the software output is shown in Appendix D.

The units used in the MEPDG for all predicted distresses are not the same for the measured distresses in the MTO PMS2 database. A comparison of the units is shown in Table 4.1. It is found that only the terminal IRI, permanent deformation (or rutting) and AC bottom-up fatigue cracking are measured with the similar units used in the MEPDG. For AC top-down fatigue cracking, the PMS2 measures it in absolute length rather than a linear percentage (m/km). In addition, PMS2 database does not specifically collect data for total cracking as predicted as the sum of reflective and alligator cracking; neither for the AC layer rutting. Therefore, only the terminal IRI, total rutting and AC bottom-up fatigue cracking are the candidate distresses whose transfer models can be locally calibrated in this study. 73

4.2 General Observations
Any calibration process involves comparison of predicted distress against measured or observed distress. The tabular comparison between observed values and predicted values of terminal IRI, permanent deformation and AC bottom-up fatigue cracking are shown in Appendix E. Figures 4.1-4.3 show the scatter plots of the predicted versus the observed values for IRI, alligator cracking, and total rutting and, respectively.

74

From Figure 4.1, it is observed that, for some sections predicted values are very higher than the field observed values. From the historical data it is found that the observed values of some those sections are not recorded and estimated using RCI values. Finally, after dropping those section cycles, 79 sections are considered for further comparison of IRI.

Figure 4.2: AC bottom-up fatigue Cracking (Alligator) comparison between Predicted and Observed Values Figure 4.2 compares the predicted damage due to bottom-up fatigue cracking with the observed extent of wheel-path alligator cracking. To better visualize the repeated data points, small random perturbations are added in both observed and predicted values. Unlike the IRI discussed above, most of the predicted and observed fatigue crackings in the 101 sections are centered at zero. This makes further calibration impossible. However, this may be no concern if the fatigue cracking shall never be a life-limiting damage mode. Nevertheless, there are a few cases where the observed cracking is 35% whereas the predicted damage is still zero. This warrants a further investigation before a confirmative conclusion can be drawn for the AC bottom-up fatigue cracking. Of the 101 sections, only two sections (red circles) seem to be over-predicted by the MEPDG. 75

Figure 4.3: Rutting Comparison between Predicted and Observed Values

The comparison of the predicted and observed total pavement rutting is shown in Figure 4.3. It is observed that for a majority of the sections the predicted values are much higher than the field observed values. This big discrepancy may be attributed to the assumed 4mm for the initial rut depth for DARWin-ME input when it is unknown. Clearly a further investigation is important before meaningful local calibration is initiated. For these reasons, those inconsistent higher values are dropped for next step and finally 77 sections are considered for further comparison.

4.3 Sample Local Calibration
After those outliers have been removed, 79 sections remain for calibration of the IRI model. The scatter plot of the predicted vs. observed IRI is shown in Figure 4.4.

Figure 4.4: IRI comparison (after Removing Outliers) In this Figure 4.4, it is observed that about 52% of the sections lie below the broken line, meaning they are over-predicted. The simple linear regression gives y = 0.4858x + 0.7252 with R2= 0.2928 and standard error = 0.276, where x and y are the predicted and observed IRI, respectively. To improve the goodness of fit, more sophisticated clustering regression analyses are carried out.

The location calibration of rutting is done in the same manner. After removing outliers with very higher predicted values, the rutting comparison is plotted in Figure 4.5.

Figure 4.5: Rutting comparison (after Removing Outliers) Form Figure 4.5, it is observed that about 74% of the sections lie below the broken line, meaning they are over-predicted. The simple linear regression gives y = 0.1483 x + 4.6263 with R2= 0.1224 and standard error = 1.786. To improve the goodness of fit, more sophisticated clustering regression analyses are carried out.

These locally calibrated models are compared with globally calibrated models which are summarized in Table 4.2. Table 4.2: Comparison of Global Calibration and Local Calibration

From Table 4.2, it is observed that, local calibration is giving lower standard error than that in global calibration. Although the number of observations in local calibration is less than the observations in global calibration, this lower standard error indicates the improvement in estimate of calibrated predicted values.

4.4 Clustering Analysis of the Local Calibration Models
To improve the goodness of fit for both the IRI and rutting models, more sophisticated clustering regression analyses are carried out. The models are sub-grouped based on the following criteria: i. ii. iii. iv. v. Road Section Highway Functional Class Ontario Zone Top Layer Material Subgrade Modulus Strength (Only for Rutting)

Figure 4.9: IRI Clustering by Top Layer Material

From Figure 4.9, it is found that IRI clustering by top layer material improves the goodness of fit for HL1 and DFC. It is also found that with same top material properties, the IRI predicted values follows the same pattern (This refers to material HL1 and HL3 which properties are same and trend line is also similar here).

Since some group have observations of 2 samples, the R2 value is not considered to be the only indicator for comparing goodness of fit. Moreover, under the same cluster group, some models improve the goodness of fit while other models show opposite trend. For these reasons, to select the optimized model, composite mean square values for each group are compared with the generalized calibrated model. These values are summarized in Table 4.3.

Form Table 4.3, after comparing with the general calibrated model, it is found that the clustered model based on the road section is giving the optimized value as this group is showing lowest composite mean square value. The clustered group based on Ontario zone giving 2nd lowest means square value. Since the clustered group based on the road section includes some samples with observation of 2, both clustering group are considered for validation in the next stage.

Similar to the IRI clustering approach, the rutting are clustered based on Road Section, Highway Functional Class, Ontario Zone, and Top Layer Material. In addition, the Subgrade Modulus Strength is used as a potential clustering parameter. Figure 4.10 presents the rutting clustering by road section, Figure 4.11 by highway functional class, Figure 4.12 by zone, Figure 4.13 by top layer material and Figure 4.14 by subgrade modulus strength.

Similar to the criterion used for clustering the IRI, the composite mean square values for each group are compared with the general calibration model to select the best clustering parameter. These values are summarized in Table 4.4.

Form Table 4.4, after comparing with the general calibrated model, it is found that the clustered model based on the functional class is giving the optimized value. i.e. this group is showing lowest composite mean square value. The clustered group based on top layer materials and subgrade modulus is giving 2nd lowest and 3rd lowest means square value respectively. Since the clustered group based on top layer materials includes one subgroup with observation of 2, three clustering group are considered for next stage of validation. 87

4.4 Validation of Analysis
A data set of 46 section cycles are further analyzed following the similar procedure and predicted distress are found using DARWin-ME software. The predicted values are further calculated using the calibrated models found from the analysis both for generalized model and also for all clustered groups. After minimizing the standard error, the values are compared with calibrated data set. Table 4.5 shows the comparison of calibrated IRI models with the validation data set and Table 4.6 shows the comparison of calibrated Rutting models with the validation data set.

From Table 4.5, after validation analysis it is found that clustered group based on Ontario zone is giving lowest composite mean square value for the validation data set which is 2nd lowest for calibration. Since the validation data set does not represent all the subgroup of clustered group based on road section, it does not have improved value. For these reasons, it can be said that IRI model can be clustered based on Ontario zone. Also the binder penetration grade, axle load spectra are classified as per zone for Ontario highway systems.

From Table 4.6, after validation analysis it is found that for clustered group based on top layer properties is giving lowest composite mean square value for the validation data set which is 2nd lowest for calibration data set. Since the validation data set does not represent all the subgroup (top layer materials HL4S) of clustered group based on top layer materials, it is not considered to select optimized method. The validation data set is giving 2nd lowest optimized value for clustered group based on highway functional class, which is also 2nd lowest for calibration data set. Therefore, it can be said that rutting model can be clustered based on highway functional class. Traffic pattern, speed, truck vehicle classification also vary depending on the highway functional class for Ontario highway systems.

After plotting the scatter between observed and calibrated predicted values for both IRI and rutting, the improved values are observed. Figure 4.15 shows the graphical comparison between observed IRI and calibrated predicted IRI. Figure 4.16 shows the graphical comparison between observed IRI and calibrated predicted IRI for optimized model based on Ontario Zone.

From Figure 4.17, it is found that the section cycle points are almost equally distributed between the two sides of the 45 degree broken line. From Figure 4.18, it is also found that the section cycle points for both Freeways are almost equally distributed between the two sides of the 45 degree broken line. For Arterial, only 2 observations are found, they are also distributed between the two sides.

4.5 t-test for Validation Data Set
Ideally, the mean of the deviates (equal the difference between observed distresses and the predicted distresses based on the local calibration model) should be zero. Due to randomness in sampling, the actual mean of the deviates might be nonzero. The t-test is used to test potential bias in the validation data set. For this test, the mean of residual is compared to value "0", based on the following hypothesis:  Null Hypothesis: mean = 0

Alternate Hypothesis: mean  0

It is found from Table 4.7 that for both IRI and rutting, null hypothesis is accepted, which represents `non bias' validation data set.

4.6 F-Test for Calibration and Validation Data Set
F-test is carried out to test the validity of the validation data set. The standard deviations of residuals are compared based on the null hypothesis (H0: 12 = 22) against an appropriate alternate hypothesis.Table 4.8 shows the summary of the F-test of validation and calibration data set.

From Table 4.8, null hypothesis that the validation set has the same variance as the calibration data set is accepted for IRI but rejected for rutting, i.e. rutting data sets are not from same population.

4.7 Summary
After calibration and validation analysis, it is found that IRI model based on Ontario zone is optimized model to predict the value. For rutting, calibrated model based on highway

functional class is the optimized model. But a precise validation data set comprising all the subgroup with sufficient observations is required before recommending these clustered models.

Chapter 5 SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1 Summary
The main objective of this study is to develop a database and a framework for sample calibration of the MEPDG distress models for the local conditions considering local traffic, climate and materials. Based on the Ontario highway PMS-2 database, the analyses are conducted for developing a framework for local calibration of the distress models for Ontario.

Using PMS-2 database as well as other required traffic data, section specific material properties and also climatic data, a calibration database is developed for the selected 101 section cycles in Microsoft Access.

The calibrated distress models are of (i) IRI and (ii) the total rutting. AC bottom up cracking is not considered for further calibration since most of the predicted values are zero. For other predicted values of distresses (Total Cracking, AC top-down fatigue cracking, and Permanent deformation - AC only ) found from the software are not taken for further comparison as observed values for these distresses are not available in the PMS-2 database.

5.2

Major Findings of the Study

Analyses of this study are mainly focused on the development a framework for calibrating the 98

MEPDG distress models (specifically IRI and Rutting) for local conditions by comparing the observed value and predicted value (found from the software). It is clear from the analysis that, the predicted values for most of the road sections are higher than the field observed values. It reveals that the MEPDG globally calibrated distress models (for IRI and rutting) are more conservative than the existing condition of Ontario highway system.

Investigations in this study suggest that IRI clustered group based on Ontario zones is the optimized model compared to the other clustered group based on road section, functional class, and top layer materials. It is also observed that IRI predicted values for similar material properties are varying in the same pattern, as IRI predicted values for equivalent material properties of HL1 and HL3 follow the same trend. Although the IRI predictions are heavily dependent on the other distresses calculated by the MEPDG.

For rutting it is clear that the clustered groups based on highway functional class is the optimized model.

Therefore, based on this input framework and investigation result, future higher level local calibration can be carried out for other remaining Ontario highway sections.

5.3

Recommendations

Based on the local calibration database and findings from the sample local calibration, several recommendations are made below:

99

(1) Materials input: Materials input are very important data for pavement analysis and design. The Local Calibration Guide requires the accuracy of these data be Level 1. For a more solid local calibration, the MTO should strive to make every effort to improve the materials input accuracy. (2) Maintenance history: The MTO is in the process of improving the data reliability of the maintenance records. The current local calibration database records a full life cycle of rehabilitated sections. However, for many sections there may be more than one life cycles before the cycle in use. Although the historical performance data are not very important, the pavement structures have been altered. This will also complicate the materials input. (3) Traffic and Climate Data: Further accuracy in input of traffic data (site specific vehicle classification, site specific axle load spectra rather than using regional data), climate data (site specific water depth, more available climate station to avoid creating virtual station) will obviously bring more accurate calibration for local conditions. Efforts should be made to improve the accuracy in the traffic and climate data. (4) DARWin-ME Input/Output: DARWin-ME allows maximum 4 asphalt layers (2 layers as existing and 2 layers as new rehabilitated layers) which complicates the analysis the pavement with more than 4 layers. The actual number of existing layers in the pavement structure is to be reflected in the analysis for better prediction. The minimum thickness of layer is allowed to be 25.4 mm. But the layer maintenance with less than 25.4 mm was not incorporated in the analysis or considered to be 25.4 mm. These shortcomings are to be addressed for realistic analysis. Moreover, the available penetration grade for asphalt binder was found different than the standard grade used in Ontario. This may have impact on the accurate prediction. Although the current version of DARWin-ME 100

allows final users to modify the parameters of the transfer functions, it is not convenient for local calibration when those exponent parameters need to be changed to reduce standard deviations. If the detailed structural responses are made available to final users, a more efficient local calibration and optimization procedure could be developed.

In addition to the above recommendations that can be taken for actions by the MTO, there are several topics that are wroth further investigating: (1) High-level Local Calibration: The current local calibration focuses only on the bias parameters. To reduce the biases and standard deviations, there are in general two approaches. One approach is suggested by the AASHTO Local Calibration Guide to adjust the exponent parameters of the transfer models. This requires one to acquire the detailed structural responses (stress, strain and deformation) under different axle loading, season and climate conditions. The other approach is taken in this study. That is done by segmenting and clustering the pavement attributes. The pros and cons of the two approaches need to be investigated. (2) Longitudinal Calibration and Life Prediction: A strong feature of the local calibration database developed in this study is the long historical performance records for each candidate pavement sections. Previous global and local calibration studies have not yet investigate the goodness-of-fit of the predicted damage along the time axis. A

longitudinal study of the performance prediction and lifetime prediction will provide further insights on the validity of the distress and IRI models in the MEPDG.
