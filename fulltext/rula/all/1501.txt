Abstract

Nickolas Muray, Environmental Portraiture, Vanity Fair by Corser du Pont Photographic Preservation and Collections Management, Master of Arts, 2010, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, in coordination with George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film, Rochester, New York.

This thesis is a case study of five environmental portraits made in Europe by New York studio photographer Nickolas Muray (1892-1965) for a 1926 commission by Vanity Fair magazine (1913-1936). The thesis, in the form of a sixty-three page illustrated essay, describes the circumstances of his photographic production, and the magazines subsequent use of his photographs. Muray produced environmental portraits by photographing his assigned subjects in their workplaces, homes, and gardens. He retouched, and then contact-printed the negatives; the prints he surrendered to Vanity Fair. The magazine cropped and otherwise manipulated the images in order to effectively place them in page layouts. From negatives, to prints, to offset-printed reproductions, the photographic materials bear aesthetically significant images of environmental portraiture that testify to Murays versatility, technical control, and creative vision.

Introduction

This thesis is a case study of five environmental portraits made in Europe by New York studio photographer Nickolas Muray (1892-1965) for a 1926 commission by Vanity Fair magazine.1 The thesis, in the form of a sixty-three page illustrated essay, will describe the circumstances of production and subsequent use of the photographs in the magazine. The essay focuses on the intersection of Murays photographic production and Vanity Fairs photomechanical reproduction, embodied in the five portraits. A distinctive feature of this approach is that the portraits exist in several iterations simultaneously: as three types of photographic objects and images: negative, print, and offset-printed reproduction.

During the commission, Muray photographed at least ten, and perhaps more than twelve portrait subjects. He exposed over one hundred negatives, then retouched most, selected several for printing, and sent an unknown number to Vanity Fair. The magazine reproduced five of the portraits. The materials considered central to this essay consist of the five portrait negatives, their nineteen prints, and seven reproductions. The negatives show retouching, and the mechanically-

The nitrate negatives and their corresponding gelatin silver prints are held in the George Eastman House Photography Collection. Versions of the photomechanical-reproductions are available in a 1966 photostatic facsimile edition of Vanity Fairs entire initial run.

Nickolas Muray was born Miklós Mandl 15 February 1892 to Samu and Klára Mandl, in the town of Szeged, near Budapest, where his family soon moved after changing their name to Murai. His parents wanted him to study law, but Miklós studied photography and printing, and he set his sights on becoming a competitive fencer. He moved to Munich, and then Berlin to continue his studies at the National Technical School. He earned the International Engravers Certificate, and landed a position making photogravures. In his late teens, he travelled through France and England, taking photographs.2

Years later, from his office at 230 East 50th Street in Manhattan, Muray typed an autobiographical outline of his lengthy professional career:

As Muray became more successful, he moved his studio uptown, in 1925 to East 48th Street, and then to two consecutive locations on East 50th.4 He produced over 10,000 portraits during the 1920s.5 He shifted production to colour advertising materials in the 1930s. In the 1940s, he taught colour photography at New York University. He died 2 November 1965, at the age of seventy-three, on the fencing court of the New York Athletic Club.

Each month from 1913 to 1936, editor Frank Crowninshields Vanity Fair aimed its content at sophisticated consumers. Page layouts consisted of advertisements, articles, cultural commentary, and portraits of the well-known. Starting in 1921, Nast printed his magazines in Greenwich, Connecticut.9 "The Condé Nast Press, (was) completely modernized to become one of the finest magazine manufacturing plants in the country."10 If Muray had stayed on as a printer, his job would have moved to Connecticut. It is an open question whether Murays experience as a printer informed his approach to making photographs intended for photomechanical reproduction, but his career accelerated and the number of his reproduced portraits landed him in the number two spot behind

In 1926, Crowninshield sent Muray on assignment to Europe to photograph celebrities. While away from the conventions and reliabilities of his studio setup, Muray undertook environmental portraiture. His subjects included Sir Hall Caine, Jean Cocteau, John Galsworthy, Ferenc Molnar, Claude Monet, Georges and Ludmilla Pitoëff, H. G. Wells, probably Frank Swinnerton, and possibly Tallulah Bankhead.12 By environmental portraiture, I mean that he portrayed his assigned subjects, often with available light, in their workplaces, homes, and gardens. Evidence of the subjects habitat is included in Murays compositions, as opposed to a neutral background. He also produced environmental portraits on trips to Washington D. C. and Hollywood.

A 1923 portrait of the playwright Eugene ONeill is the only example of Murays environmental portraiture in Vanity Fair prior to the 1926 commission.13 Until 1926, Vanity Fair reproduced Murays studio portraits in page layouts with other photographers work, and also as featured full-page portraits. After the 1926 travel commission, the magazine relegated his studio portraiture to pages shared with other photographers and reproduced Murays environmental portraits as fullpage features. Murays photo credits had begun to dwindle in early 1929, and he

Other candidate sessions are those of Mr. and Mrs. H. de Vere Stacpoole, GEH 1977:0189:2725-2735, and an unidentified royal couple, GEH 1977:0189:1891-1897. 13 "Eugene ONeill, On The Balcony of His Lighthouse at Provincetown," in Vanity Fair 21, no. 4 (December 1923): 51.

earned just three credits after 1931. The reasons for this decline are outside the scope of this thesis.

This shift in Vanity Fairs emphasis from studio to environmental portraits can be examined by considering the conditions for both Murays production and the magazines reproductions. It is conceivable that Muray and Crowninshield discussed stylistic concerns before Murays departure for Europe. In any event, Muray chose to photograph his subjects with visible evidence of their surroundings. An examination of all of the Muray portrait sessions available at George Eastman House reveals only travel-related environmental portraiture. Photographers and photography studios operated in London and Paris, but the expense of sending a correspondent was consistent with Vanity Fairs promotion of luxury goods and services, and its celebration of extravagant gestures. Visible evidence of the photographs location provided readers with proof of that expense, and portraying a European celebrity in a studio would have defeated the purpose of the exercise.

Many of Murays portraits from the trip, including those of Caine, Cocteau, and Wells, did not make it into Vanity Fair. Muray may not have sent these portraits in, or did and they were neglected. The magazines art directors worked with what Muray sent them, and in most cases reproduced environmental portraits full-page. The 1923 ONeill environmental portrait was reproduced full-page,

6

implying that the selection criteria for full-page reproductions did not change with the increase of environmental portrait production, rather, the increased availability of environmental portraits allowed for an increased frequency of fullpage reproduction. Generally, captions and photo credits for environmental portraits state foreign or non-New York locations, hinting at an otherwiseassumed Manhattan location for portraits.

My main line of enquiry is a close reading of the portrait materials and images in order to describe the circumstances of Murays environmental portrait production, and then to determine Vanity Fairs use of the portraits. This environmental portraiture provides an opportunity to witness the photographers versatility and technical control in unusual and challenging circumstances. The complex elements of his environmental portraits can be considered in each of their material iterations of negative, print, and offset-print reproduction. Murays portraits can also be considered in terms of their aesthetic significance. This thesis will position the portraits within the context of his studio career in order to demonstrate that Murays environmental portraiture is encouraged by travel. To support this argument, the conclusion of this essay briefly interrogates the two other Vanity Fair commissions undertaken by Muray in similar circumstances away from his studio. If travel encouraged a trend towards environmental portraiture, then this type of comparative analysis may assist in ascertaining whether a similar pattern existed in other photographers work.

Literature Survey

The George Eastman House Photography Collection contains 400,000 photographs, and nearly 25,000 of these are from Murays New York studio. The result of his professional commercial work, the photographs consist primarily of black and white nitrate negatives and gelatin silver prints from the 1920s and 30s, and a variety of colour materials from the 1930s onwards. The black and white photographs are almost all portraits; the colour materials were used to make both portraits and advertising work. In addition, the Richard and Ronay Menschel Library at George Eastman House holds Murays mockup for his never-published "Great Tribes of Africa." The assemblage of colour photographs and typed textual materials illustrate his photographic production method as employed in a 1960s ethnographic context.

Historical surveys of photography scarcely mention Muray, and the few instances that exist are mainly in the context of his great friend and colleague, Condé Nast Head Photographer Edward Steichen.

History of Photography (New York, 1982), Miles Orvells American Photography (New York, 2003), Martin W. Sandlers The Story of American Photography (Boston, 1979), and John Szarkowskis Photography Until Now (New York, 1989) do not mention Muray.

Michel Frizots A New History of Photography (Köln, 1998), Robert Hirschs Seizing the Light: A Social History of Photography, 2nd ed. (New York, 2009), Lemagny and Rouillés Histoire de la Photographie (Paris, 1986), and Naomi Rosenblums A World History of Photography (New York, 2007) each include an illustration and a paragraph or so on Muray. Passing mention is made of his 1920s portraiture, often as an introduction to his spectacular colour advertising work. The George Eastman House Collection: A History of Photography, From 1839 to the Present (Köln, 2005) concentrates on Murays technical ability; his 1920s portraiture is discussed, as is his commercial colour work of the 1930s. According to Eskinds Index to American Photographic Collections: Compiled at the International Museum of Photography and Film at George Eastman House, 3rd enlarged ed. (New York, 1996), after the George Eastman House Muray collection, secondary institutional holdings include the National Museum of American History, Arizona State University, and the Centre for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. As of this writing, an undetermined amount of material remains with Murays daughter, Mimi Muray Levitt.14

Two George Eastman House publications address Murays photographs: the first thematically organises image subject and content, and the second explores physical aspects of photographic deterioration and image preservation. Robert A. Sobieszeks George Eastman House exhibition brochure for Nickolas Muray (Rochester, 1974) includes a checklist of the 181 exhibition objects thematicallyorganised as Portraits, Figure Studies, Fashion, Advertising, Cover and Packages, Still Lifes, Miscellaneous, or Biographical. Portraits of three of Murays 1926 European subjects are included in the exhibition. This theme-based approach provides an overview of Murays career, but it does not examine production circumstances, nor the use of images in the 1920s. The Image journal article "Saving the Image: The Deterioration of Nitrate Negatives" (Hager 1983) examines Murays deteriorating negatives and efforts by George Eastman House personnel to contact print them using a variety of photographic papers. A short biography of Muray is given, as well as a history of the nitrate negative, and an explanation of printing methods. The focus of the article is on the twenty-three colour reproductions that illustrate the preservation efforts.

Three monographs on Muray provide biographical information and anecdotes regarding his personal relationships with his subjects, along with representative sample surveys of his portraits. Use of his photographs is generally not discussed. Each book refers to the 1926 Vanity Fair commission, though few

10

specifics are given, and the portraits and portrait sessions are not made to relate to each other, or to their intended use as portraits for photomechanical reproduction in the magazine.

Salomón Grimberg, I Will Never Forget You: Frida Kahlo to Nickolas Muray, Unpublished Photographs and Letters (Munich, 2004) focuses on Murays personal relationships in the 1930s. It contains a valuable "Chronology of Nickolas Muray" in which the entry for 1926 includes references to Vanity Fair portrait commissions including President Coolidge and Secretary of Commerce Hoover, as well as the European trip. Eight European subjects are named: Caine, Cocteau, Galsworthy, Molnar, Monet, Pogany, Shaw, and Wells. The entry for 1929 mentions another Vanity Fair travel assignment, this time to Hollywood, where his subjects included Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, and Jean Harlow.

Paul Gallicos The Revealing Eye: Personalities of the 1920s, Photographs by Nickolas Muray and Words by Paul Gallico (New York, 1967) mentions subjects Caine, Galsworthy, Molnar, and Shaw. Muray recollects that Shaw and Caine as having been photographed the same day. A conversation with Wells is included. Cain, Cocteau, Galsworthy, Molnar, Monet, Shaw and Wells are represented by image reproduction. A 1925 trip to Paris to photograph Yvette Guilbert is mentioned in this work and nowhere else (no image of Guilbert is published in

11

Vanity Fair after 1924). The monograph Murays Celebrity Portraits of the Twenties and Thirties: 135 Photographs by Nickolas Muray (New York, 1978) begins with a remark by Monet marveling at Murays photographic technology. The monograph mentions the 1926 commission as taking place in London, Paris and Berlin, and refers to Galsworthy, Monet, Shaw, and Wells. It includes reproductions of Cocteau, Galsworthy, Molnar, Monet, Shaw, and Wells.

In Vanity Fair The Portraits: A Century of Iconic Images (New York: Abrams, 2008), a short paragraph on Muray mentions his over 10,000 portraits, and specifically the 1926 assignment. It lists portrait subjects Galsworthy, Shaw, and Wells in London, and Monet in Paris, and reproduces a Monet portrait. The periodicals early 20th century context is framed and interpreted in essays by Terence Pepper and Christopher Hitchens. Diana Edkins Richardsons Vanity Fair: Photographs of an Age, 1914-1936 (New York, 1982) reproduces a few of Murays 1929 Hollywood portraits, but offers no biography or analysis.

A 1920 article "The New Art of Camera Painting" (Donnell, 1920) predates Murays success, but includes a description of Murays first Greenwich Village studio. This article is specific in its descriptions where most available sources provide only variations on the same broad account of Muray.

12

Several sources provide models for approaching a collection as vast as Murays. David Harris Eugène Atget: Unknown Paris (New York, 2003) reconstructs Atgets production methods by a close reading of his photographs. Essays in Elizabeth Edwards and Janice Harts invaluable Photographs Objects Histories: On the Materiality of Images (New York, 2004) offer considerations of discrete bodies and types of photographic work in order to stress photographic materiality.

For examinations of photographic production and use, Glenn G. Willumsons W. Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay (New York, 1992) tracks the photojournalists assignments from production to publication. Thierry Gervais Études photographiques journal article "De part et dautre de la "garde-barrière": Les errances techniques dans lusage de la photographie au sein du journal LIllustration (1880-1900)" (2009) considers the hybridity of hand-painted photographic source material for nineteenth-century magazine reproductions. William A. Ewing and Todd Brandows Edward Steichen in High Fashion: The Condé Nast Years 1923-1937 (Minneapolis, 2008) touches briefly upon production and use, while Patricia Johnstons Real Fantasies: Edward Steichens Advertising Photography (Berkeley, 1997) firmly connects Steichens production to magazine reproduction by analyses of business contracts.

In addition to the objects themselves, this essay depends mostly upon two primary sources: Murays personal papers and a facsimile edition of Vanity Fair

13

(Ann Arbor, MI., 1967). The Muray papers, available in microform from the Archives of American Art, consist, in part, of memoirs and correspondence with his portrait subjects. The 1967 photostatic facsimile of the entire run of Vanity Fair, from September 1913 to February 1936, includes an Index. This key, compiled under the able supervision of Louise Heinze, permitted the research and exploration of forty-five volumes of portraits and textual references.

Cross-referencing the Vanity Fair facsimile indexical references, conducting a page-by-page read of the facsimile editions, and then locating and comparing the reproductions with the matching George Eastman House collection objects revealed the patterns of use that I describe throughout this paper. Reconciling Murays notes with the aforementioned sources biographical entries, and then with the photographic objects and images themselves, made it possible to partially reconstruct Murays 1926 European portrait sessions.

Jean Cocteau and Georges and Ludmilla Pitoëff in Paris, France, June 1926

Murays "Notes on Celebrity Portraits" refers to his near-exact contemporary Jean Cocteau (1889-1963) only in passing, but significantly establishes the artist as one of his 1926 European portrait subjects.15 Vanity Fair reproduced five of the portraits that Muray made during four sessions with six primary subjects. Among Murays papers are examples of correspondence with several of the European subjects, but letters to or from Cocteau are not among them. Also, Vanity Fair did not reproduce any Muray portraits of Cocteau.16 No available documents establish the time or place of the Cocteau portrait session.

The George Eastman House photography collection holds nine Muray portraits of Cocteau and two companions.17 Of the nine exposures, two are group portraits of the trio, one is a dual portrait of the unidentified couple, and the remainder is comprised of two individual portraits of each subject. (fig. 1, fig. 2.) Cocteaus

Louise Heinze, comp., "Authors," in An Index to Vanity Fair: September 1913-- February 1936 (Ann Arbor, MI.: University Microfilms, 1967), 20. 17 There are nine negatives and five prints associated with Murays 1926 portrait session with Jean Cocteau and Georges and Ludmilla Pitoëff in the GEH Photography Collection. Catalogue records in the GEH database TMS assign a date range of ca. 1922-1961 to all of the objects. Only Cocteau and Muray are identified as constituents. The Pitoëffs, unlisted as constituents in TMS, are listed as unidentified companions of Cocteau. One portrait of Georges had been mis-identified as Cocteau, though that mis-attribution has now been corrected.

On 05 June 1926, Jean Cocteaus play Orphée premiered at the Théâtre des Arts, Paris, 17e.18 Georges Pitoëff (1884-1939) staged the production and played the title role.19 His wife Ludmilla Pitoëff (1899-1951) played Eurydice.20 The run of the theatrical production coincides with Murays presence in Paris.

of these three figures in a democratic allotment of negatives points to a session devoted, at the time, to all three figures equally, who likely appear together promoting their theatrical event.

The genial group is portrayed seated at a small table, their backs to a large window. (fig. 6) The table is set with a white cloth, bowl of fruit, plates, and glasses. Digital reproduction and enlargement of the images clearly show spot lights reflected in the subjects retinas, and shadows of the drinking glasses projecting back towards the window. This implies that the furnishings, including the cartoonish backdrop, are front-lit Orphée stage props. Muray photographed the subjects in the environment of their place of work. In two group portraits, the Pitoëffs flank Cocteau, and in their double portrait, they playfully respond to someone out of frame. In the two portraits of Ludmilla, she remains seated. In the first, she presents the bowl laden with pears, looking up to our right. In the second, her hands are clasped neatly on the tablecloth, and she looks demurely to our left. (fig. 7) This is the portrait reproduced in Vanity Fair.

Except for one example, (fig. 2) all of the sessions negatives are retouched; all evidence suggests Muray retouched his own negatives, or supervised their retouching. Ludmilla Pitoëffs central negative is manipulated by short scratch marks along her hairline and on her face and throat, and a broad swirl of a brush stroke around her entire head. (fig. 8) The surface of an untreated nitrate cellulose negative is slick, resisting pencil marks. In order to allow for pencilled retouching, the surface must be given "tooth".21 A solution of gum mastic, oil of juniper or turpentine, and asphaltum lightly applied to the slick surface of the

negative provides a surface that accepts retouching marks. The gum mastic has the unintentional benefit of preserving the portion of image below, so that deterioration of these treated areas of the negatives may be delayed.22

Vanity Fair reproduced the Pitoëff portrait in the 142-page April 1928 issue, nearly two years after the portrait session. (fig. 9) The April 1928 table of contents categories include "In and About the Theatre," "Concerning the Cinema," "The World of Art," "The World of Ideas," "Literary Hors dOEuvres," "Satirical Sketches," and "Miscellaneous."23 "Miscellaneous" lists the monthly feature "We Nominate for the Hall of Fame," on page eighty-nine.

Representations of five personages make the cut: Parisian actress Pitoëff, in her only appearance in the magazine, U. S. Ambassador to Mexico Dwight Morrow, artist Pablo Picasso, German novelist Thomas Mann, and Irish poet George W. Russell (Æ). Biographical text underlies each of the photomechanical portrait reproductions. Three rectangularly-framed portraits, credited to photographers "MURAY," "WIDE WORLD," and "MAN RAY," display subjects against light backgrounds; two uncredited octagonally-framed portraits display subjects against dark interior and exterior backgrounds.

To suit the arrangement of five portraits, the Muray image has been reduced, cropped, and reversed. The original image of Pitoëffs face measured 8 cm. vertically, and the reproduction measures 3.8 cm., a reduction of approximately 50%. All the contextual elements are cropped out; the environmental portrait now resembles a studio portrait. Murays soft-focus portrait of the demure Pitoëff appears to be gazing at the confident Morrow, who once aimed his attention into Wide Worlds sharply-focused camera lens. Man Rays epic Picasso, here the central portrait, appears to look beyond Pitoëffs biographical text to the columns of text on the opposite page. Below and to the left of Picasso, Mann stares directly out at the viewer, his back to the gutter edge of the page. Russell, from the lower right corner of the page, looks directly over the Picasso biography and then on to Mann. The relational layout of portrait subject images creates a visual conversation. If the Pitoëff portrait had not been laterally reversed, four of the five

20

subjects would have been facing to the left, visually throwing greater emphasis onto Bernard Darwins essay "The Golfers Commandments" on the facing page.

Under each of the nominated personages is a caption. For the actress:
LUDMILLA PITÖEFF [sic]

/ Because she is a Russian who, since the war, has

become one of the first actresses of France; because she and her husband, the admirable Pitöeff [sic], are the Lunt and Fontanne of Paris; and finally because the Pitöeffs [sic] have made Paris accept with enthusiasm a modern and artistic theatre.24 Vanity Fair reduces Murays restrained environmental portrait of Pitoëff to a mere headshot; the caption explains the actresss import.

Claude Monet, June 1926, Giverny, France

Of the subjects Vanity Fair asked Muray to contact in order to schedule their portrait sessions, responses came from all except Monet. In order to complete his assignment, Murays unidentified contact in Paris drove him the seventy-some kilometers northwest to Monets residence at Giverny. Upon arrival at Monets compound, a nurse held the unannounced visitors at bay, answering the bell twice without admitting the photographer and his travelling companion. The pair cooled their heels on the street. During this wait, Muray took the opportunity to photograph himself, his friend, their driver, and their impressive car.25 (fig. 10)

As Murays "French was less than scant"26 his guide continued to assail the nurse, who eventually relayed the message, and Monet allowed admittance. Murays recollection of the day includes both an outline of the portrait session, including general locations, and a brief description of his working methods. Although he did not look ill, he seemed tired. After greeting us, he sat down on a bench and I began to work quickly. After a bit he asked me when I would start taking the pictures. I explained that I already had taken half a dozen or so. He said this was impossible--I had not told him what to do or where to look, and besides, he had not heard any "click." I told him I had a "silent shutter," and showed him the bulb Id been holding behind my back--when I pressed this, it opened and closed in fifth of a second exposures. He had noticed me fussing with changing film holders, but hadnt realized that exposures were being made. He laughed at what he said was a "great trick," and relaxed into complete friendliness. He took us down to his famous lily pond which hed painted so often, and I took more pictures there, both of him and of the pond...27

Five of Murays twenty-four exposures,28 which present the subject resting on a small bench, the camera at a respectful distance, support the photographers

(fig. 12) Initially clad in a long coat, soon handed off to the nurse, (fig. 11) Monets outfit includes a herringbone-patterned suit with white frilled shirtsleeves emerging from jacket cuffs. The painter sports a straw hat, worn at a slight angle, and small, round wire-rimmed spectacles. As Monet wears his beard long, the general effect projected is that of a private, protected person. Muray successfully engaged the artist, and continued further communication, as evidenced by further communication that eventually led to an exchange of signed prints. (fig. 13)

After realizing Murays covert portrait acquisition method, Monet stated "So now you will know me as I am and not as I would have tried to hide myself from you."30 While previous literature employs this statement to comment on the portraits that Muray took unbeknownst to Monet, the statement may alternately imply a willingness to offer unguarded moments. Over the course of the sitting, Muray gradually moves the camera in closer, and, in three close-ups, Monet doffs his hat, and, in one pose, removes his glasses to reveal his damaged eyes.

While the aging painters eyes and hands bore testament to years of artistic production, Muray chose to minimize these attributes for the purposes of

Muray sent Vanity Fair a print of a three-quarter length left profile for reproduction. The subject stands, hands in jacket pockets, hat brim low, eyes directed at the horizon, (fig. 16) a stance that supports the artists monumental stature in Western culture. The sun-dappled foliage of the garden, Monets attribute, supplies an evocative backdrop. Readers acquainted with the artists work, and this being Monets fourth appearance in Vanity Fair,31 could place the subject in his garden environment, which reads easily even in reproduction.

reduced approximately 15%, and laterally reversed. Even a casual reader flipping through the magazine could spot the mans handkerchief, conventionally placed on the left, peeking out from a right breast pocket, but if not laterally reversed, Monets image would have appeared to turn his back to the article on the facing page, thus directing attention to the left, or out of the magazine.

Five pale lines border the portrait entitled: "Claude Monet--The Last of the Old Masters". A two-column captioning paragraph provides the reader a casual appraisal of the artists character and cultural contribution, further contextualizing the figure.32 The relatively substantial photo credit reads, "A PHOTOGRAPH MADE
ESPECIALLY FOR VANITY FAIR BY NICKOLAS MURAY, AT GIVERNY, FRANCE, JUNE, 1926."

This emphasis on location, as well as the date, places the well-known New York photographer out of his studio, working in the field. The photo credit explicitly states Murays production circumstance. The assemblage of fonts, font sizes and formatted text serves as a pedestal for the portrait; the detailed caption coupled with the confident portrait composition resonate with authority and definitiveness.

George Bernard Shaw, Friday 02 July 1926, London, England

After photographing his French portrait subjects, Muray crossed the English Channel, arriving in London on or before Thursday 01 July. Of his two assignments booked for that Friday, first up was Shaw at 9.30, at his address in central London.33 His home in Adelphi Terrace...was over the...shop which printed most of his books. The building was on an islet in a triangular area, approached by a bridge. When I rang the doorbell, Mr. Shaw himself came down and received me with enthusiasm. Seeing that I was overburdened with camera, film holders, etc., he offered to lend a hand with my equipment, and carried my wooden tripod as I followed him up to his study.34

Already, the scenario shifted from the initially hostile, and then merely indifferent reception which Muray had first encountered at Monets residence. Shaw, a photographer in his own right and a founder of the Royal Photographic Society, immediately engaged in friendly discussions with Muray about his camera and lighting, and then spoke of other arts. Author entertained photographer by playing

ballads on a harpsichord and singing folksongs; Muray admired Shaws albums of photographs. Mrs. Shaw entered around eleven offering tea, Muray realised that the time of his one-thirty appointment with Caine was approaching, and so he moved to begin the portrait session.

Fig. 18. GEH 1977:0663:0025, George Bernard Shaw, with crop lines, date, and signatures in black ink: "G. Bernard Shaw / 1926 / Muray".

Here, Murays equipment list gets more specific: "We set up the camera in his study. There were no lights--in those days we used only available light. It was an 8x10 view camera with double extension bellows and an old Struss pictorial soft-

29

focus lens."35 He found in his subject an unself-conscious model, and in short order produced twenty-three negatives. After tea, the pair decided that proofs would be exchanged for Shaws reproduction approval. Muray eventually sent several prints to Shaw, of which he returned four with autographs. (fig. 18)

Reconciling Murays account of the session with available correspondence between Muray and Shaws secretary, Blanche Patch, clarifies the negotiations for setting up the portrait session, and the actual timing of the session itself. Patchs typed letter of 24 June to Muray at his hotel in Paris prompts that Friday 02 July is "the only day between the 1st and the 8th on which [Shaw] is likely to be in London. Will you telephone here on the morning of that day about 10.30?"36 Decades later, Muray recalled that the sitting had been agreed upon for 9.30.37 Actual photography began in earnest at 11 oclock, after equipment set up, the extended discussion of photography, and Shaws musical recital. These diverse activities conceivably took more than half an hour; the earlier start time of 9.30 appears probable. This earlier time slot implies further discussion by post or phone. The end result is that Muray worked quickly, producing the two dozen shots in under an hour and a half.38

Fortified by the "hectic and most exciting"39 shoot and Mrs. Shaws tea, Muray made his way north through London to Caines residence at Hampstead Heath for the second session of the day. Photographer and subject first toured the house searching for appropriate locations, beginning in the bedroom office, or, rather, the bed/office, (fig. 19) and then on to the library. Although Vanity Fair chose not to reproduce the Caine portraits, Murays account of the session rounds out his workday.

I didnt hurry, and he was very patient, discussing and trying out various poses as we went along. Abruptly at 4 oclock the maid came in with (tea) ...I took my leave, promising to send a few photographs...and asking if he would be kind enough to sign a couple for me, which he did.40

Muray either did not mention, or did not grant photo approval to Caine. In any event, the day of photography resulted in the two Shaw portraits eventually reproduced on the pages of Vanity Fair.

Of the twenty-three Shaw portraits, ten incorporate a backdrop that appears to be a leather-upholstered folding screen, with metal brads visible running along one vertical edge.41 The textures and reflectivity of the screens surfaces allows for visual interest without drawing attention away from the portrait subject. Both of the central portraits are taken from this series. (fig. 20, fig. 21) The thirteen remaining portraits stand Shaw in the middle of an art-filled room,42 in front of a bookcase, and at the harpsichord,43 and then seated at two different windows.44

The two central portraits share the same backdrop and subject, but the lighting effects, pose, and framing are dissimilar. The most visually complex of the two (fig. 20), hems in the angular pose of Shaw. He sits cross-legged, an open manuscript of musical notation in his lap steadied by his right hand, his left brought up to his temple. The near edge of the manuscript and the suits sleeves and shoulder form a path for the eye to be continually drawn up to the subjects face. Vertical elements of the screen echo Shaws jacket lapels and the arms of a wicker chair, contributing stability to the composition. The dark middle stretch of

The second central portrait negative initially appears to be a simple profile bust. (fig. 21) Two other profiles do not provide the controlled visual ingredients of the central profile portrait. In one, Shaw turned his face ever so slightly away from the camera. (fig. 22) In the other, the coat collar swallows up Shaws neck, and Shaw turned his face towards the camera. (fig. 23) Finally, the interaction of patterns in the upholstered screen with Shaws profile is more pronounced in the unchosen profiles than in the central profile portrait.

Fig. 24. GEH 1977:0189:2635, Murays retouching of George Bernard Shaws face and jacket, verso detail.

Muray conventionally retouched his negatives regardless of planned use, but retouched the Shaw examples to different levels of completion. The central portrait with manuscript bears minimal retouching; only Shaws right eye has had work done. Retouching of the profile negatives reflects the exposures relative 34

formal merits. A few casual scratch marks, here on the neck, there on the face, are visible on the unreproduced negatives. The central profile negative is retouched on the face, the neck, and the rumpled back of the jacket. (fig. 24)

The 174-page November 1926 issue features the Shaw portrait with manuscript on page fifty--the verso of the Table of Contents. The source image, reduced approximately ninety percent and cropped slightly on the top edge, contains an alteration: a dimming of the upholstered screens left seam. While this removal begins to obscure the environmental nature of the portrait, the manuscript visually bolsters the sense that Shaw is at home with personal property. (fig. 25)

Fig. 25. "George Bernard Shaw at Seventy," in Vanity Fair 27, no. 3 (November 1926): 50. Shaw, 22.1 x 17.6 cm.

The captioning text reads: "George Bernard Shaw at Seventy: A Recent Study of the Famous Irish Playwright and Publicist Who Is Now Completing a Book In 35

Defense of Socialist Doctrines, to Be Followed Next Year by a New Play on a Historical Theme".45 Across the gutter edge, Sherwood Andersons memoir of blue-collar experience is formatted into the standard three columns of text. Pairing the portrait of the Socialist Shaw with the Anderson factory article effectively creates an implicit bridge of political content between the two pages.46 The photo credit, "ESPECIALLY PHOTOGRAPHED FOR VANITY FAIR BY NICKOLAS MURAY" is less informational than the Monet caption, yet emphasizes Murays production.

Twenty-six months after the portrait session and twenty-two months after the first portrait was published, Vanity Fair reproduced the second Shaw portrait. (fig. 26)

36

Reduced twenty-five percent, the portrait image is intact. Murays use of available light to illuminate the leather upholstery in London two years prior here forms a shimmering field which envelopes Shaws glowing countenance.

The 122-page September 1928 issue placed Shaws full-page spread "G. B. Shaw Tells All" on the verso of the Table of Contents. Shaws profile faces a political essay by Walter Lippmann on the facing page. As a sign of the cultural times, the contents page began listing "Concerning the Cinema" between publication of the first Muray portrait of Shaw and the second, and the caption for Shaws portrait underscores this shift: "The Anglo-Irish Philosopher and Comedian Admits All the World to His Talking Film Party."47 The two-column mini-article beneath the caption simultaneously promotes Shaws five-minute Movietone reel and alludes to Shaws political writings.48 Simple, yet effective, the portrait and caption advertise new cinematic technology and the subjects work. Also, the photo credit is now a simple namecheck: "MURAY." The environmental aspect evident in the November 1926 reproduction is now virtually absent.

departure, but before the next Art Director Mehemed Fehmy Agha implemented the use of sans serif, lower case fonts and asymmetrical page layouts, as seen late in the 1930s,50 Vanity Fairs art direction languished. Campbells layouts are graphic and witty. The enigmatic September 1926 cover illustration features a lithe, curiously-posed figure, probably Virgo, athletically rolling a hoop along a lawn. (fig. 27) The whimsically illustrated Table of Contents incorporates textual elements into the design. (fig. 28) Post-Campbell, September 1928s sentimental narrative scene of a coy young couple is paired with a drastically reduced Table of Contents. A standard layout restricts whimsy to thumbnail graphics and icons. A return to the second Shaw reproduction now sees a tentative presentation. (fig. 26) The image is smaller, allowing for breathing room, but a surplus of captioning text weighs heavily on the composition.

Photographic portraits of Shaw appear in nine issues of Vanity Fair between March 1914 and January 1935, virtually the entire run of the magazine.51 The 1935 issue includes a two-page spread of portraits of celebrities photocollaged to appear as historical figures. The layout incorporates a barely-recognisable reworked version of the September 1926 Muray portrait of Shaw;52 a thumbnail reproduction of the unalterated image appears later in the issue.53 (fig. 29, 30) Murays portrait session with Shaw on Friday 2 July 1926 resulted in an eight and half year-long reproduction trail.

John Galsworthy, Saturday 03 July 1926, London

On 23 June 1926, at his Hampstead address in London (near to Caine), John Galsworthy wrote to Muray: "Dear Mr. Muray, I could give you 12 midday on Saturday July 3, if you would not be taking more than half an hour. Very truly yours, John Galsworthy. Grove Lodge adjoining the tall white Admirals House in the Grove."54 The envelope bears a cancellation stamp of 1.30 pm 25 June and is addressed to Mr. Nickolas Muray at the Hotel Mirabeau, Paris. Written on a Wednesday, and mailed on Friday, the letter likely arrived in Paris after the weekend, alongside the Shaw and Caine appointment confirmations.

During the lunchtime session with Galsworthy, Muray exposed at least nine negatives.55 The letter provides a reference to a strict time frame for one of Murays sessions. The minimum number of exposures is known and the portrait images are available for examination, so a partial reconstruction of the production is possible. Galsworthys requested half hour can serve as a hypothetical time constraint, though the actual duration of the event is unknown. Treating the

There are ten negatives, and six prints, of John Galsworthy and his residence (1133 is an image of the writers desk.) Galsworthy is listed as a constituent in TMS. All of the objects are given a date range of 1922-1961.

portrait session as a discrete body of work contextualizes the central portrait. Muray arrived with his equipment at Galsworthys address at noon, entered, introduced himself, exchanged pleasantries, and then either located the optimal site for the portrait session, or asked for or was told his subjects preferred site.

Already, several precious minutes of the agreed-upon half hour had passed. Muray accessed his equipment and, as evident in the negative images, situated the subject in four consecutively different lighting conditions. In each he directed or suggested that his subject sit, stand, look this way or that, fold his arms, cross his legs, or put his hands in his pockets. All the while, Muray manipulated his light meter, refocused his camera, and exposed and handled the large 8 x 10 negatives. Muray occasionally kept his tripod stationary as he framed several portraits exactly the same.56 Finally, Muray determined that he had what he needed, said his goodbye, and then exited the building with his equipment. Manual dexterity, speed, and, one can imagine, social grace, allowed for this production. Each of the eight negatives provides a clear, usable portrait.

The central negative depicts Galsworthy standing in his library, his back to a dormer wall which angles inward to follow the roof structure.57 (fig. 31) Visible in the background is an alcove bookshelf below a frame fastened to the inwardlysloping wall. These soft focus angular elements do not distract from the subject;

his neutral facial expression, mannered placement of both hands in pants pockets, and the soft folds of a three-piece suit provide a neutral ground for a medallion displayed prominently at the middle of his belted vest. The negative bears evidence of both retouching methods: the swirl of gum mastic over the subjects head, and hurried scratches on the subjects face and neck. (fig. 32)

The remaining seven portraits consist of profile shots and less-compelling variants of the central portrait. Each of the negatives from the session is retouched. This may point to the portraits uniform quality and equal potential for print reproduction.58 In one image, Galsworthy sits with a manuscript in his lap.

GEH collection contains four prints from the central negative, and a fifth print, 1977:0663:0020, from negative 1977:0189:1132. The image selected for reproduction is present in three prints 1977:0188:1125A, B, and C and the enlargement 1971:0047:0086.

A self-portrait of Muray sitting in Galsworthys dormer nook provides a mystery. He took time to set up the shot, and expose the film himself; the cable for shutter release is visible below him on the floor. (fig. 33) Is it a way for him to suggest a pose for Galsworthy? (fig. 34) Three Galsworthy poses approximate, but do not replicate, Murays.59 Muray biographer Paul Gallico remembers, "If the client was to occupy a chair, Muray would sit there first while chatting, assuming the attitude he wished from the sitter...In nine cases out of ten, (the sitter) would imitate Nicks posture and half the battle was won with never a word being spoken..."60

A question remains: did Muray take the shot with his silent shutter, or is the selfportrait an open demonstration of the equipment for Galsworthys benefit?

Muray sent contact prints from his negatives to Vanity Fair for reproduction. This working method may have had to do with control of his images. Glenn G. Willumsons analysis of W. Eugene Smiths involvement with Life magazine contains an explanation of Smiths exercising of "authorial prerogatives": Doing his own printing enabled Smith to retain control over his negatives and to influence a second phase of photo-essay production: initial picture selection. At Life, when photographers turned their undeveloped negatives over to the Life photo lab, the rough selection of prints was made by Life staff members and the final selection by department editors. By developing and printing his own negatives, Smith assumed this control and made the first selection of his raw picture material.61

Muray prints associated with the 1926 commission provide information in two ways. First, Muray chose only a few images for print and magazine reproduction, and did not crop substantially, reduce, or reverse images, though on occasion he enlarged certain portraits to 11x17.62 Second, the prints provide information by way of autographs, (fig. 13, fig. 18) crop lines, (fig. 18) and inscriptions. These include studio stamps comprised of the ubiquitous "PHOTO BY MURAY" coupled

(see appendix: "GEH Print Inscriptions") This may represent efforts of his family to assert ownership of the Muray materials. A variety of photographic print materials coupled with multiple studio stamps point to serial printing, probably over decades. (fig. 35, 36)

Besides the portrait subjects autographs from 1926, one applied printed label affixed to the verso of one Galsworthy, a contact print of the same negative reproduced in Vanity Fair, signals contemporaneous use. (fig. 37) "THIS PRINT WAS

another exhibition label from Stockholm, 16-31 October 1926.63 (fig. 38) These two examples, and their may be more, reflect Murays parallel involvement exhibiting works in the 1920s. The exhibition of Murays Vanity Fair portrait in a fine art context, and concurrently with publication, provides a clue as to Murays ambition and an example of his success in different realms of photography.

Vanity Fair included Murays portrait of Galsworthy, the authors fourth appearance in the magazine,64 in the 114-page January 1927 New Years issue. On page thirty-eight, the verso of the Table of Contents page, the image is reduced approximately ten percent and slightly cropped on all sides. (fig. 39) A discrete border frames the reproduction, with credit given to "NICKOLAS MURAY" beneath the right edge. A title centered under the image reads, in whole: "John Galsworthy Writes His Last Play: The Famous English Novelist and Chronicler of the Forsytes Announces that "Escape," His Newest Drama Soon To Be Produced By Winthrop Ames, Completes His Work As A Dramatist."65

The dramatists gaze is directed at Murays lens, and at the reader. The frontal pose holds its own against the wall of text on the facing page, frequent contributor Sherwood Andersons "The Far West: An Author Gives His Impressions of the Country Beyond the Mississippi." Unlike the Monet and Shaw poses, Galsworthys figure does not overtly connect the two pages, rather, the forthrightness of the figure and the symmetrical text block echo each other. The contextual elements of the portrait evoke a private library setting appropriate for an author, subtly reinforcing the literary content of the facing page. The private library environment made public encourages readers empathy with subject, and integrates image and text.

Murays Related Portraiture in Vanity Fair

The European portraits central to this thesis are reproduced in six issues of Vanity Fair. These same issues contain thirteen other Muray portraits and most reveal traces of having been produced in the studio.66 The September 1926 issue features four portraits by Muray:67 teenage illustrator Pamela Bianco,68 Monet, Ziegfeld actress Greta Nissen, and President Calvin Coolidge, whose portrait will be discussed in the conclusion to this paper. The portraits of Monet and Coolidge are reproduced full-page.

Two strong light sources cast overlapping shadows of Bianco onto a mottled backdrop; the session dates from 1922. (fig. 40) The original three-quarter length portrait is reduced and cropped to a head-and-shoulders composition in reproduction. (fig. 41) Biancos portrait is arranged with five other portraits on the page. Though they initially appear uniformly conventional, they do not share

The subjects of eight portraits are identified as constituents in TMS. A significant number of Murays subjects remain unidentified as constituents in GEH catalogue records, so the remaining five subjects portrait materials are likely to appear with future examination of the collection. 67 Coolidge is on page forty-eight, Bianco is on page sixty-one, and Nissen is on page seventy-three. 68 The Bianco portrait issues from GEH negative 1977:0189:0272.

Another Muray portrait of Bianco dated to 1926 shows the same mottled backdrop visible in the 1922 session.69 If similar lighting conditions and the backdrop appear in other, unattributed portraits, then they may have been produced in Murays studio.70 In the same issue, Murays Nissen is composed on a page with nine other portraits.71 (fig. 42) What appears to be a mix of studio and natural lighting casts shadows of Nissens hands and sleeves onto her blouse, and cast a shadow of her hair onto a backdrop strikingly similar to the Bianco backdrop. Of the eight portraits reproduced with the Nissen, none have a backdrop similar to Murays.

Additional negatives 0276, assigned the standard date range of 1922-1961, and 0277, are dated to 1926. 70 In 1925, Muray moved his studio from the MacDougal address uptown, but his methodology appears to have remained consistent. 71 Nissen is not identified as a constituent in TMS, though a search of the entire Muray collection may produce the appropriate negatives from the portrait session.

The Morgana exhibits Murays studio lighting and standard backdrop; the closely-cropped Chamlee is studio-lit.72 Murays portrait of Frank Swinnerton appears at the top of a "We Nominate for the Hall of Fame" gallery on page eighty-five.73 Murays Swinnerton is illuminated by a diffused light source, and has no readily identifiable backdrop. (fig. 43)

In January of 1966, Muray wrote about the 1926 commission, mentioning the oftquoted "ten subjects" and then listing seven: Cain, Cocteau, Galsworthy, Molnar, Wells, Monet, and Shaw. He elaborated on the sessions with Shaw, Wells, Monet, and also Swinnerton. This implies that Swinnerton is either one of the previously un-named commissioned subjects, and therefore the sixth European environmental portrait, or an independently photographed subject.

(fig. 44) Associated negatives from the portrait session include images of the author and his wife at an ivy-covered cottage. Muray on Swinnerton: "We hit it off immediately... Hours sped by, and when I left he presented me with one of his books, inscribed, "In memory of an afternoon which might have been an ordeal and which proved entirely delightful."75 As Caine, Galsworthy, Monet, and Shaw did, both Mr. and Mrs. Swinnerton autographed prints.76 (fig. 45) The portrait shows ambient lighting similar to Murays other interior environmental portraits.

evident, but the room furnishings suggest a slightly cramped residence rather than a more open studio location.82 (fig. 48) It is conceivable that Muray hired equipment and photographed Bankhead while on the 1926 trip. It could be argued that environmental portraits of stage and film actors would be appropriate if constructed from studio trappings. The Vanity Fair caption for the reproduction alludes to Bankheads expatriate status: "A Quintet of American Actresses Who Deserted the New York Stage for the British, And Who Have Had Their Greatest Successes and Triumphs on the Stages of Old London".83 Another portrait from the session is reproduced the following January, again as one of five on a page.

The April 1928 issue of Vanity Fair features four portraits by Muray:84 American ballerina Doris Niles, Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia, Nissen (making a repeat appearance), and then Pitoëff. The studio portrait of Niles is given the full-page treatment.85 (fig. 49) Segovia is depicted with his acoustic guitar, and in both the reproduction and its matching negative,86 studio lighting can be discerned. Nissen reappears, this time reversed laterally for inclusion in a five-portrait spread. Murays portraits in this issue are interesting in two primary ways, as the Pitoëff is the only one of the five central environmental portraits not reproduced full-page, and the Nissen is re-published and reversed, incidentally bringing the total of Muray portraits in these six issues to twenty-one.

The September 1928 issue of Vanity Fair features two portraits by Muray: Shaw, and Clarence Darrow. The three-quarter length, studio-lit Darrow found in Murays negative87 is reduced and closely cropped. Embedded in his article "Prohibition Cowardice," Darrow glowers out from a five-centimeter button, as opposed to the full-page environmental Shaw. (fig. 26)

Murays New York portraits are shot in the studio with standard lighting and backdrops. He frames his European subjects, now probably including Swinnerton, and possibly including Bankhead, in their workplaces, homes, and gardens. Of Murays portraits reproduced in six issues of Vanity Fair, four of seven European environmental portraits are reproduced full page, (and in the case of Shaw, repeated as cropped versions,) and one of thirteen New York studio portraits is reproduced full-page. Vanity Fair accords significantly more real estate to Murays environmental portraiture relative to his studio portraiture.

Conclusion: 1926 Washington D. C., and 1929 Hollywood

This essay has clarified the nature of Murays environmental portrait production and reproduction, and positioned Murays environmental portraits within the context of his career, demonstrating that Murays environmental portraiture is associated with his travel. This argument is further strengthened by briefly interrogating two of Murays other major Vanity Fair major commissions: another 1926 trip, to Washington D.C. to photograph politicians,88 and a 1929 trip to California to photograph Hollywood stars.

In Washington D. C., Muray photographed President Calvin Coolidge and the First Lady at the White House,89 and Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Hoover at an unidentified location.90 Vanity Fair made full-page reproductions of Murays environmental portraits of the Hoovers, the President,91 and the First Lady,92 and then also one scaled-down "Hall of Fame" portrait of the First Lady.93

A survey of all Muray portraits assigned dates from 1925 to 1927 in TMS reveal predominately studio portraiture, except for the 1926 Washington and European subjects. 89 GEH 1977:0189:0499-0504 and 1977:0695:0129-0130 Calvin Coolidge, and 0505-7, 0509-0517, Grace Goodhue Coolidge. 90 GEH 1977:0189:1430-4, Herbert and Lou Henry Hoover. 91 "The President at the White House: A Recent Portrait of Calvin Coolidge Taken in Washington by Nickolas Muray," in Vanity Fair 27, no. 1(September 1926): 48. 92 "The Retiring First Lady of the Land," in Vanity Fair 30, no. 4 (June 1928): 46. 93 "We Nominate for the Hall of Fame", in Vanity Fair 28, no. 4 (June 1927): 75.

In both of her reproduced portraits, Grace Goodhue Coolidge is posed on the south porch of the White House. The first, for the June 1927 "Hall of Fame," sees environmental cues cropped out; the plain backdrop is actually the surface of a White House porch column.94 The second portrait, an uncropped full-length right profile,95 is granted a full-page in the June 1928 issue. (fig. 51) Soon to be a former tenant, "Mrs. Calvin Coolidge Surveys Her Garden From The Vantage Point of a White House Balcony." The First Lady looks to the horizon, her figure firmly inhabiting the architecture and landscape. Her simple sheath and woven flower basket contrasts with the base of another massive stone porch column, a black cloud of awning furled above. Murays adept integration of figure and ground in this environmental portrait anticipates the European sessions.

Murays portrait of President Coolidge frames the subject within a map of the United States of America, implicitly signaling presidential responsibility. Murays dual portrait of then-potential presidential candidate Herbert Hoover and wife places the couple on a small porch with background foliage; the portrait could have been taken anywhere. A narrow porch column frames the future presidents head, lending his appearance a modest solidity. In reproduction, the image is laterally reversed to draw readers attention to the facing page.96

The 1929 Vanity Fair Hollywood commission resulted in six published portraits. Three are situated on movie sets and one on a beach; two do not have sufficient contextual clues to identify sites. Environmental portrait locations for Hollywood actors include places of recreation or work, and these may include studio lights and backdrops, which, along with actors poses, complicate an environmental designation for a portrait. A photograph of an actor appearing in character on set is conventionally categorized as a "scene still," and staged photographs of cast and crew backstage are categorized as "behind-the-scenes shots."97 A photograph of an actor, or a politician for that matter, projecting a persona while located in a workplace may be categorized as an environmental portrait. If considered for the human subject and not the movie product, can behind-thescenes shots also be categorized as environmental portraits?

Murays portrait of Marilyn Miller, published full-page in October 1929,98 spotlights the subject, foregrounded by the darkened silhouettes of observers seated in directors chairs. Murays portrait of Myrna Loy, reproduced full-page and slightly cropped in the November 1929 issue,99 (fig. 52) is less clearly located. Art Director Aghas use of lower-case sans serif fonts and asymmetrical layout explains that Loy starred in Under a Texas Moon, "a new talking picture made entirely in colours."100 As evidenced by images from the entire portrait session, Muray trailed the ingénue around a realistic outdoor set. Miller and Loy are either in character or projecting personae, but on set and in costume.

The first dual portrait features Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. swimsuited and on the beach.

portrait of sisters Loretta Young, Polly Ann Young, and Sally Blaine in May 1931 (and again in a scaled-down and radically cropped version in July 1931)105 bear no overt suggestion of environmental portraiture. (fig. 56) The ambiguities do not necessarily point to studio portraiture, however, as the portraits may have been taken on set, but closely-framed. 106 Shearer appears wearing a large crucifix. The caption for the portrait reads, "Miss Shearer, whose fame has grown with the advent of talking films, plays a modern Juliet in her new picture, "Their Own Desires." 107 Shearers crucifix and the caption both imply the actor posed in costume, and in her environment.

This essay shows that Muray, who in the 1920s produced studio portraiture in New York City, produced environmental portraiture when on travel commissions for Vanity Fair, and even at the time of production exhibited his works in a fine art context. In most cases, the magazine reproduced the environmental portraits intact and full-page. In the few instances where the portraits are reduced in size and placed with other photographers portraits in page layouts, the environmental cues are in every case cropped out. After 1925, Murays studio portraits are generally reduced and composed in page layouts with other portraits. Thus it appears that Murays environmental portraiture came to hold greater stature than his studio portraiture at Vanity Fair.

On travel commission, Muray solved the problem of not having a studio, and consistently produced useful and aesthetically significant portraits in widely different circumstances. A close examination of the complete trajectory of his portraits from negative, to print, and then to publication underscores his great versatility, technical control, and creative vision. Moreover, it is the methodology of looking at the negative, print, and reproduction that reveals these insights.

Nickolas Muray Notes on Celebrity Portraits, January 1966

The following transcriptions depend upon the microformed Muray papers held in the Archives of American Art. In this section of his remembrances, Muray recalls his European portrait subjects. (typed): NICKOLAS MURAY / 230 E. 50th Street / New York 22, N.Y. / January 1966
NICKOLAS MURAY NOTES ON CELEBRITY PORTRAITS

In 1926 Mr. Frank Crowninshield and Mr. Conde Nast sent me to Europe to photograph ten famous people for VANITY FAIR. The assignments included Sir Hall Caine, Jean Cocteau, John Galsworthy, Ferenc Molnar, H.G. Wells, Claude Monet (the painter,) and George Bernard Shaw. Each, except for Monet, selected a convenient date within a two week period. Each sent a letter in reply, except Mr. Shaw, who sent a postcard with a date--June 25th, 1926 signed "GBS".
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW

Mr. Shaw had set the sitting for 9.30 A.M. His home in Adelphi Terrace in London was over the printing shop which printed most of his books. The building was on an islet in a triangular area, approached by a bridge. When I rang the doorbell, Mr. Shaw himself came down and received me with enthusiasm. Seeing that I was overburdened with camera, film holders, etc., he offered to lend a hand with my equipment, and carried my wooden tripod as I followed him up to his study. Here I was introduced to Mrs. Shaw, a lovely middle-aged lady with a charming smile, who said / "You two boys have a lot in common. Ill leave you to proceed with your mutual interests." / Mr. Shaw was one of the founders of the Royal Photographic Society, and was very much interested in photography, in more than an amateur way. He processed his own films and made his own prints. We set up the camera in his study. There were no lights--in those days we used only available light. It was an 8x10 view camera with double extension bellows and an old Struss pictorial softfocus lens. We discussed the pros and cons and pictorial qualities of the camera at length. / There were a number of large and medium-sized pianos and piano-type instruments in the study -- a spinnet and harpsichord among them. I had forgotten that I his youth Shaw had been a music critic, before he started his "serious" writing. I asked if he knew how to play all these instruments. Thereupon he sat down at the harpsichord and began to play ballads. He sang well, in not too bad a voice, and seemingly knew endless verses of the old folksongs. / He then showed me his albums of photographs he had made with obvious loving care. They were all well above amateur standards, and I was happy to praise 68

them quite truthfully. Mrs. Shaw came in ­ it was then about 11 oclock ­ and asked if we would like to have tea. I realized then how fast the time had passed. I was never very good at watching the clock, but reluctantly suggested that we really should take a few pictures before having tea. We only had an hour or so left, since I had a 1:30 appointment with Sir Hall Caine. / And so we proceeded with the picture taking, discussing the lighting and other photographic technicalities as we worked. Shaw was a terrific model. No matter what he did, he was graceful. Almost every picture was interesting, with different expressions, without any self-consciousness. I shot about 18 or 20 negatives before calling it a day. We then sat down to tea and crumpets, which Mrs. Shaw provided. I promised to send him all the proofs in case he wanted any eliminated before I submitted them to VANITY FAIR, and later did so. He returned them all "okayed," but indicated his personal preference among them, asking if I would make a few prints for him. He was also kind enough to sign four prints from the sitting for me, which I now have in my collection.
SIR THOMAS HALL CAINE

This was my second appointment in London on the 1926 location trip. I just made the deadline, arriving at his home after the hectic and most exciting sitting with George Bernard Shaw. A petite, very attractive blonde woman opened the door at my ring, and I told her I had a date with Sir Hall Caine. She said "Come in ­ my husband is waiting for you upstairs." / Unfamiliar with the stringent formalities of British nobility, I addressed her as "Lady Hall" as I thanked her. She angrily pointed to the stairway and disappeared, seeming very upset. Later I found out why ­ she should be addressed as "Lady Caine." Sir Hall explained this when I found him upstairs and introduced myself. He expressed some wonder at my wandering about the house alone, and burst out laughing when I told him that "Lady Hall" had shood me up and vanished. If I made further blunders of this kind in England, I never found out about them. I learn quickly, and did not repeat this one. / Sir Hall took me through the house to look for a location I might find interesting for a background. He asked if Id like to see where he worked, and took me to his bedroom. There I found a king-sized bed, almost covered with papers, magazines, and books. Sir Hall climbed into the middle, burying his legs among the papers and propping himself against the pillows. I thought it was an amusing way to work on dreaming up plots of the detective stories for which he was famous at the time. He was the rage of the theatre and movie colonies in England for his melodramatic novels. (THE SHADOW OF A CRIME, THE DEEMSTER, THE MANXMAN, THE CHRISTIAN, THE ETERNAL CITY, THE PRODIGAL SON, etc.) / I took a few shots of this situation and then proceeded in the library, with other interesting backgrounds. We exchanged many points of view, and I found him particularly interested in movies and Hollywood. Until then, most Hollywood pictures had been shot with "available" light ­ just as I worked with the still camera. Recently, however, a "new" technique of shooting indoor scenes had 69

become popular, and Sir Hall wanted to know all about it. I did my best, dredging up everything I could remember from my Hollywood visits. / I didnt hurry, and he was very patient, discussing and trying out various poses as we went along. We also talked about Burne-Jones and other painters in vogue at the time. Piccasso [sic] had not yet been heard of. His interest in art was one I shared, and I think we both enjoyed the exchange of views. / Abruptly at 4 oclock the maid came in with a tray of cookies and tea. Lady Caine joined us a few moments later. I tried to make up with a few anecdotes and jokes for my unintentional disrespect toward Lady Caine, and we became friends. Said she: "Oh please, dont give it a thought. We English are used to American informalities, though we love our traditions at the same time." / I took my leave, promising to send a few photographs to Sir Hall, and asking if he would be kind enough to sign a couple for me, which he did.
H. G. WELLS

Long before I met Mr. Wells, I had become one of his devoted admirers. At the 1926 sitting it didnt hurt a bit that I could almost quote him, chapter and verse. Id been a fan of Jules Verne in my youth, and guess I was just a natural for anyone who attempted to probe the unknown--a truly educated fore-runner of what we now call science or space fiction. Almost always I was nervously talkative in the early stages of a sitting with a stranger, unless, of course, the sitter took and held the stage immediately. Mr. Wells greeted me with reserve and dignity, and I fell back on my old habit of trying to get my subject to relax by talking about his work, surroundings, anything which would evoke easy, characteristic expressions. As often happens, one thing led to another, and Mr. Wells began questioning me about cameras and camera techniques. He was much interested in color photography, then in an experimental stage. It happened that Id been fooling around with color, in Germany and in England, and so was able to tell him quite a bit about it. / At one point in the sitting, a loose screw on my camera bothered me, and I pulled from my pocket a rather curious knife which had been given me by a gadgeteer friend. Among other oddities, the knife held a small screwdriver. Wells asked to examine the knife the conversation was entirely about crazy tools and Rube Goldberg type inventions. I knew Goldberg and tried to give Wells a verbal picture of that wonderful man. / The sitting lasted far beyond the time allotted. We finally parted with a warm handshake and mutual promises to meet again soon.
CLAUDE MONET

The great Impressionist was the only one of my prospective sitters who had not responded to letters and wires requesting an appointment. He was then 86, and, as it turned out, was not to live out the year (1926). All photographers are persistent, however, and I was by no means the exception. Dining with a friend in 70

Paris, I mentioned my uncompleted assignment. It turned out that he owned a car. Despite his protests that this sort of thing simply "wasnt done," he drove me to Monets house in Giverny. / A nurse answered the bell and told us Monet was ill and could not see us, let alone pose for us. My French was less than scant, so my friend took over in great Gallic style. He asked the nurse to tell Monet that I had come, following the letters and wires he must have received from me. She returned saying that Mr. Monet felt too ill to be disturbed. This time my friend went on and on at great length, explaining that I had come 3000 miles just to photograph the master; the sitting would take only a few minutes of his time; future generations would appreciate such an image of the great painter; etc. The poor woman, overwhelmed by the quantity as well as content of the harangue, trundled off again. This time she returned with Monet himself. / To me it was like meeting one of the gods on Olympus. I was always a worshipper of art, and the wonderful photogenic old man was the greatest living painter. / Although he did not look ill, he seemed tired. After greeting us, he sat down on a bench and I began to work quickly. After a bit he asked me when I would start taking the pictures. I explained that I already had taken half a dozen or so. He said this was impossible--I had not told him what to do or where to look, and besides, he had not heard any "click." I told him I had a "silent shutter," and showed him the bulb Id been holding behind my back--when I pressed this, it opened and closed in a fifth of a second exposure. He had noticed me fussing with changing film holders, but hadnt realised that exposures were being made. He laughed at what he said was a "great trick," and relaxed into complete friendliness. He took us down to his famous lily pond which hed painted so often, and I took more pictures there, both of him and of the pond. Once more my sitting was long over before the nurse finally came out with fire in her eyes to demand that Monet rest. He actually thanked me for what he said was a thoroughly enjoyable interlude.
FRANK SWINNERTON

Another popular and prolific English novelist of that time was Frank Swinnerton (THE CHASTE WIFE, SUMMER STORM, THE ELDER SISTER, NOCTURNE, etc.) We hit it off immediately. He was most articulate, and talked at length about his own work as well as that of his contemporaries. He analysed and critisized in depth, and what impressed me most was that his only disparaging remarks were directed against himself. Hours sped by, and when I left he presented me with one of his books, inscribed "In memory of an afternoon which might have been an ordeal and which proved entirely delightful."

Vanity Fair captions for...

"Claude Monet--The Last of the Old Masters," in Vanity Fair 27, no. 1 (September 1926): 64. The French Painter, Now Eighty-Six, Who Founded the Impressionist School of Painting. Why is it that the important movements in art are greeted always, at their inception, by derision and scorn? Search the history of art as you will and always you will find this to be true. There was the laughter that greeted Claude Monet, the founder of French Impressionism--the first school of art to study the vibration of light. Fortunately for Monet, he was able to marshal on his side, while all the world was still jeering, such masters as Manet, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas, and Renoir, a group of which Monet remains the sole survivor. He is finishing his years in the secluded village of Giverny, near Rouen. He suffered the ridicule of the world in the same proud manner as he accepts, today, fame, fortune and the worlds applause.

"G. B. Shaw Tells All," in Vanity Fair 31, no. 1 (September 1928): 38. G. B. Shaw Tells All: The Anglo-Irish Philosopher and Comedian Admits All the World to His Talking Film Party. / An ambassador of the Movietone, advancing with soft words and a very large and very plausible cheque, is the anonymous hero to whom fell the honour of winning George Bernard Shaw for America and talking films. And so we see and hear him, if not in the flesh, in a reasonable verisimilitude, registering, in five minutes of lightning-changes, benignity, surprise, quizzicalness, the wish to please, arch good humour, and ingratiating his ravished audience with one (1) parlour trick, Mussolinis forbidden dome-- "he, poor fellow, cannot take his off; but I can put mine on--so!" (lowering brows) "--and I can take mine off--so!" (brows re-ascend, orbs twinkle, lips part, revealing pearly teeth, face breaks into a thousand beaming, shimmering, fascinating fragments, and audience faints with joy). This Movietone interlude is perhaps only a symbol of the general relaxing movement in which Shaws career is currently indulging. The encyclopedic Womans Guide to Socialism and Capitalism, just published, was really the Intelligent Womans Guide to Bernard Shaw. Mr. Shaw has revised his strategy; now he wants to be understood, so that it may be inferred that he is not afraid of being understood--or of being misunderstood. He is yawning, he is stretching, he is looking about him to be amused and to be liked. Does it mean that he considers his days work finished? Or is it only the seventh inning?
