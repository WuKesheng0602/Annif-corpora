1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
Since the advent of engineering, simulation of physical systems has been regarded as great means to understand and predict system's behaviour. Aircraft modeling and simulation is no exception and the use of flight simulators dates back to the early phase of aviation industry. The simulators were primarily designed for pilot training purposes but soon the benefits of flight simulation to support engineering designs were realized and flight simulators started to play an important role in aircraft design. The engineering flight simulators reduce lifecycle costs because development and testing of complex aircraft systems can be done before actual flight tests. The simulator provides useful data that can be used to assess performance and behaviour of the aircraft and its systems. Moreover, the response of aircraft systems can be visualized in various platforms. There are different objectives of the engineering simulation study in flight simulators. A simulation model may be built to analyze performance, stability characteristics and mission of a flight vehicle.

1.2. AIM
The aim of this project is to build a 3 degrees-of-freedom longitudinal flight simulation model in Simulink to allow rapid configuration and flight dynamic analysis of an aircraft. The model will have a capability to solve longitudinal equations of motion for any given aircraft geometry. Furthermore, the equations will be trimmed to obtain the longitudinal equations of motion consisting of aerodynamic stability and control derivatives which helps in determining the longitudinal dynamic stability characteristics of an aircraft. The simulation model will provide results to determine whether an aircraft is statically and dynamically stable longitudinally and can be trimmed at reference flight condition.

1.3. END RESULTS
The flight simulation model offers many benefits for a new aircraft development projects. It can assist an aircraft designer in meeting Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) related to aircraft manoeuvring and handling qualities. The designer is able to predict aircraft
1

behaviour in specific flight conditions and can produce a stable and controllable aircraft by determining its stability characteristics. The simulation-based testing will save time and effort prior to conducting actual flight tests. The simulation model can also be extended to serve any purpose of study. Most importantly, the simulation model can be used in academics to learn and teach the subject of flight dynamics.

1.4. APPROACH
The project will be initiated by developing a simulation structure for a 3-DoF longitudinal model in Simulink. The simulation model will consist of aerodynamics, thrust, and equations of motion blocks. The aerodynamics block will contain various sub-systems and aerodynamic data for a generic STOL aircraft. The aerodynamic data will be calculated using Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL) open source software AVL and will be stored in the look-up tables. Once the model is solved in Simulink, a linearization script written in Matlab will be used to trim and linearize the model. The resulting model in linear state-space format will be used to obtain longitudinal response in order to determine the dynamic stability characteristics of an aircraft.

2. ENGINEERING FLIGHT SIMULATION METHODOLOGY
Aircraft flight simulation is a part of overall aircraft design process and is complex, time consuming and iterative in nature. The process involves various technical steps and requires use of sophisticated software having modeling and simulation capabilities such as Matlab/Simulink. It is pertinent to highlight key aircraft design steps related to flight simulation as follows [1]: I. Defining Aircraft Mass and Geometry II. Determining Aircraft Aerodynamic Characteristics III. Creating Aircraft Flight Simulation IV. Designing Flight Control Laws V. Completing the Design Process For this project, only the first three steps are followed as the last two steps are beyond the scope.

2.1. DEFINING AIRCRAFT MASS AND GEOMETRY
It is the intent of this project to render the flight simulation model open source so that it is compatible with an aircraft of any geometry and respective data. This is ensured by constructing an aerodynamic model that is comprehensive to intake aerodynamic data based on any geometry. In other words, to perform simulation for a different aircraft, its respective data can be incorporated in the model and equations of motions can be solved. It is important to discuss the procedure to be followed for a new aircraft geometric configuration. The process starts from establishing the system level requirements and specification for a new aircraft which results in performance criteria of an aircraft. The aircraft geometry is determined at this stage to calculate stability and control derivatives that directly affects aircraft performance. For this project, the mass and geometry data for a generic short take-off and landing STOL transport aircraft is used [2]. The mass properties data include aircraft weight, center of gravity location CG and moment of inertia Iyy. The geometric data includes wing reference area Sref, horizontal tail area St, distance between CG and horizontal tail quarter chord l t, tail span bt, wing mean aerodynamic chord and x-distance between CG and wing quarter chord xwb. All the data is stored in the Initialization script (appendix A).

2.2.DETERMINING AIRCRAFT AERODYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS
Determining the aerodynamic characteristics of an aircraft is one of the crucial steps of the modeling and simulation study. The equations of motion can only be solved once the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the aircraft body are found. Before the aerodynamic forces and moments can be calculated, the aerodynamics coefficients for both wing and tail are required. There exist three methods to obtain aerodynamic characteristics for a given geometric configuration namely analytical prediction, wind tunnel testing and flight testing. Each method is briefly explained below and the chosen method for the project is discussed at the end of this section.

3

2.2.1. ANALYTICAL PREDICTION

Calculating aerodynamic data for an aircraft analytically is a quick and less-expensive method. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is a modern method that is rigorous and broad. However, to quickly gain an insight into the aerodynamic behaviour of an aircraft, a very useful analytical prediction method called USAF Digital Datcom program can be used to determine aerodynamic characteristics. A Digital Datcom input file defines the geometric configuration of the aircraft and the flight conditions to calculate the aerodynamic coefficients [3]. However, Datcom is not open source and needs to be purchased. Fortunately, there exists alternative software developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology called AVL [4]. AVL is an open source software that can be used to quickly predict aerodynamics characteristics for a given aircraft geometric configuration. However, an input file of aircraft geometry is needed and is not easy to create one for a given aircraft.
2.2.2. WIND TUNNEL TESTING

To perform wind tunnel testing, a scaled model or full-sized prototype is needed which makes the method expensive and time consuming. The method is used mainly by aircraft manufacturers on new development projects.
2.2.3. FLIGHT TESTING

Flight testing is another expensive and time-consuming process and cannot be used in the very early stages of design since the aircraft is yet to be built.
2.2.4. AERODYNAMIC DATA CALCULATION USING AVL SOFTWARE

It is obvious based on the previous discussion that the last two methods cannot be adopted in the academic setting and the ideal method for learning purposes should the utilization of either the digital Datcom program or AVL. Since AVL is open source and released under the GNU General Public License, it is the only method used for this project. However, there are limitations as discussed later. To use AVL, a configuration definition for an aircraft is required in the form of keyword-driven geometry input file. This input file consists of defined sections and also uses another input airfoil file for a particular aircraft wing to generate the aerodynamic data [4]. AVL offers several input files for selected aircrafts; however, generating an input file
4

manually for any other aircraft is complex and requires an extensive geometric data. Since only the wing and horizontal stabilizer aerodynamics is to be simulated in this project, a simple input file can be generated for a given STOL aircraft as both the wing and horizontal stabilizer geometric data is available. However, a complete shape or drawing is not available and some serious limitations should be kept in mind. The key geometric parameters are defined for both the wing and stab. As the airfoil data for this particular aircraft is not known, a Boeing 737-800 airfoil data is used. This introduces inaccuracy in the aerodynamic coefficients calculated. However, this is the only method available to generate aerodynamic data for an aircraft for which the much needed mass properties and key geometric parameters are known with the exception of thrust data. The compromise made at this stage is bound to have a significant impact on simulation results. The geometric input file for the STOL aircraft is shown in appendix C. The generated data at a sample angle of attack is shown in appendix D. Figure 1 shows both the wing and horizontal stabilizer geometry in AVL. The surface has discretized finite elements on which the aerodynamics forces are calculated using AVL's unique Vortex-Lattice Method [4]. A Vortex-Lattice method is best suited for aerodynamic configurations which consist mainly of thin lifting surfaces at small angles of attack and sideslip. These surfaces and their trailing wakes are represented as single-layer vortex sheets, discretized into horseshoe vortex filaments, whose trailing legs are assumed to be parallel to the x-axis [4].

Figure 1: Aerodynamic Geometry in AVL showing Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer 5

The aerodynamic data for both the wing and horizontal stabilizer is stored in Simulink look-up tables. The data include the lift, drag and pitching moment coefficients for the wing and total lift and drag coefficients for the horizontal stabilizer.

3. BUILDING A FLIGHT SIMULATION MODEL IN SIMULINK
The objective of the flight simulation model is to determine whether a given aircraft is longitudinally stable and can be trimmed at a chosen flight condition. Therefore, it is essential to model the aircraft components that have a significant impact on the static and dynamic stability of an aircraft. Stability is the tendency of an aircraft to converge on the initial equilibrium condition following a small disturbance from trim [5]. To establish trim equilibrium, a horizontal stabiliser (Hstab) angle and thrust is adjusted to obtain a lift force sufficient to support the weight and a thrust force to balance the drag at the desired speed. The trim adjustment is therefore an important result to be achieved through the simulation model. The model deals with the longitudinal trim only. Another essential task is to determine the dynamic stability of a given aircraft. This requires solution of the longitudinal equations of motion and finding both dynamic stability modes, the short period pitching oscillation and the phugoid. The equations of motion can be solved by trimming the simulation model and a dynamic response can be obtained.

The simulation model is designed in the graphical environment of Simulink in conjunction with Matlab [6]. Simulink is the preferred choice since the model can easily be visualized. The model consists of three main blocks namely Equations of Motion, Aerodynamics and Thrust blocks. Each block is defined by an input and an output. The functionality of each block is implemented using flight dynamics theory. All the blocks are then linked to build a flight simulation model that can be run to observe aircraft behaviour. The modelling process starts with the aerodynamics of an aircraft in which both the wing and tail contributions are modelled. Both models become a subsystem of the aerodynamics block. The thrust block is then constructed which is linked with the equation of motion block along with the aerodynamics block. The integrated block or the top level simulation model is shown in Figure 2. The main two inputs to the model are throttle from thrust block and horizontal stabilizer (Hstab) angle from the aerodynamics block. The main outputs are pitch
6

angle theta, pitch rate q, forward velocity u and vertical velocity w. Each block of the top level simulation model is explained in the rest of this section.

Figure 2: Top Level Flight Simulation Model

3.1. EQUATIONS OF MOTION MODEL BLOCK
The equations of motion (EoM) model shown in Figure 3 is the central model of simulation and is also called the aircraft dynamics model. All other models work to provide total forces and moment acting on aircraft to the equations of motion block which then calculates the attitude (theta), pitch rate, forward velocity U and vertical velocity w. It also calculates the position coordinates of aircraft. Four selector blocks are utilized to output theta, pitch rate Q, U and w. These selector blocks enable the Trimming and Linearization script to select the states and provide the

7

trimmed input. Moreover, the state-space variables are defined using selectors where the variables needed are U, w, q and theta. Another block called Atmosphere and Air Data is constructed to get alpha, Mach number, dynamics pressure Q, velocity V and altitude from Xe, Ze, U and w. This block is also useful in creating a closed loop simulation model where alpha, Q, V and altitude are fed back to the model and help the model find the operating point to linearize the system.

Figure 3: Equations of Motion Block

3.2. AERODYNAMICS MODEL BLOCK
The aerodynamic model can be regarded as the most complex and important model of the flight simulation model. It solves the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the aircraft about its center of gravity. These forces and moments are then used to solve equations of motion. The top level Aerodynamic Block is shown in Figure 4. The block requires five inputs such as angle of attack, dynamic pressure Q, velocity V, pitch rate q and horizontal stabilizer Hstab angle. The Hstab input also has an additional constant block of
8

Hstab_ini where the initial Hstab angle is stored for simulation initiation. The three outputs of the block are the body force along x-axis Xaerob, body force along z-axis Zaerob and the pitching moment Maerob in body axes.

Figure 4: Top Level Aerodynamics Block

The aerodynamics block is subdivided into four sub-system blocks that enable the main block to perform its function. The sub-system blocks are shown in Figure 5. All the aerodynamic data needed for the simulation model is stored in the look-up tables of these sub-system blocks.

9

Figure 5: Aerodynamics Block Sub-system

The two blocks of paramount importance are Wing-body and Tail-plane blocks which model aircraft's wing and tail aerodynamics. The lift and drag coefficients for both the wing and tail are summed before being multiplied by the dynamic pressure Q and S ref. The moment coefficient of wing and tail is multiplied by the dynamic pressure Q, S ref and . A third block called CG location moment block is essential to calculate the pitching moment due to center of gravity CG. The fourth block is a Wind to Body block that convert forces from wind axis to the body axis. Each of the four blocks is briefly explained in the following section. The forces Xw and Zw, and the pitching moment Mw along the wind axes are calculated according to the following logic [7]: Xw = (CDwb + CDtail)*Q*Sref Zw = (CLwb + CLtail)*Q*Sref Mw = (Cmwb + CMtail)*Q*Sref*

where Q is the dynamic pressure

10

3.2.1. Wing-Body Block

The main level wing-body block is shown in Figure 6. This block outputs the CLwb, CDwb and Cmwb for various alpha.

Figure 6: Wing-body Aerodynamics Block

The sub-system of the wing body block stores the aerodynamic coefficients CL, CD and Cm for aircraft wing for various values of alpha at a specified mach number as shown in Figure 7. All the wing data is stored in this block.

Figure 7: Look-up Table Block for storing wing aerodynamic data

A sample data stored in a Simulink look-up table for CL at a Mach number of 0.22 at various angles of attack or alpha is shown in Figure 8 . The data for CD and Cm is stored in a similar fashion. The values of alpha for which all the coefficients are calculated and stored are -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7 degrees.

11

Figure 8: Sample Look-up Table storing lift coefficient CL for various Alpha for Mach of 0.22 3.2.2. Tailplane Block

The tailplane block also known as horizontal stabilizer block is shown in Figure 9. The block stores the total lift CLT and total drag CDT coefficients calculated from AVL at various values of Hstab angles.

Figure 9: Tailplane Block

There are four inputs to the block namely alpha, Hstab, q and V. The logic of the block is based on the following relation [8]: CLT =  + Hstab + (lt*q/V) -  The downwash  is neglected. lt is the distance of tail from CG, q is the pitch rate and V is the velocity of the aircraft. The relation is based on the fact that the CLT should be calculated at the total angle of attack of the tailplane and not just Hstab.
12

The tailplane sub-system is shown in Figure 10 indicating the complete logic of the tailplane block.

Figure 10: Tailplane Block Sub-system

The tailplane at quarter chord block shown in Figure 11 calculates the aerodynamic coefficients CLTail, CDTail and CMTail for the horizontal tail. Its sub-system block shown in Figure 12 uses the necessary functions that take Sref and St into consideration.

Figure 11: Tailplane at Quarter Chord Block

The functions are defined based on the following relations [9]: CLTail = [CLT(St/Sref) - CDT(St/Sref)] CDTail = [CDT(St/Sref) + CLT(St/Sref)] CMTail = - [CLT(lt St/Sref )]

13

3.2.3. CG Location Moment Block

The CG location moment block shown in Figure 13 is necessary to calculate the moment generated due to the CG location. Ignoring this block will lead to serious modelling errors and the simulation results will be very inaccurate. The block calculates the pitching moment Maerob based on two inputs, Xaerob and Zaerob. The logic of the CG location moment block is based on the following relation [10]. Maerob = - [(xwb)(Zaerob) - (zwb)(Xaerob)] xwb is the x-distance between the CG and the quarter chord and zwb is the z-distance between the CG and the quarter chord. The xwb is multiplied by Z-force Zaerob whereas zwb multiplied by x-force Xaerob to get the resulting pitching moment developed due to CG location. Both the xwb and zwb are defined in the initialization script as follows:
xwb = (CG-25)/100*c_bar zwb = 0 % neglected

14

Figure 13: CG Moment Block with its Sub-System

3.2.4. Wind-to-Body Block

The aerodynamic forces are calculated in the wind axes and must be converted to the body axis to perform flight simulation. Figure 14 shows a Wind-to-Body block that converts forces Xw and Zw from wind axes to forces Xaerob and Zaerob in body axes.

Figure 14: Wind to Body Block

15

The conversion of the forces in wind axes to body axes is based on the following relations [11]: Xaerob = [Zw sin - Xw cos] Zaerob = [-Zw cos - Xw sin] Maerob = M + Mw The first two relations shown above are stored in the functions defined the Wind to Body block sub-system shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15: Wind to Body Block Sub-system

A function block Fcn calculating Xaerob is shown in Figure 16. The function block Fcn1 to calculate the Zaerob holds a similar expression.

Figure 16: The function block calculating Xaerob

16

3.3. THRUST BLOCK
The thrust block is the last block that must be integrated with the aerodynamics and equation of motion blocks. It calculates the thrust force that is added to Xaerob, the x-force in the body axes. The main input to the thrust block is the throttle setting with range of value between 0 and 1. The throttle_ini is the initial input value of the throttle setting for a given flight condition and is stored in a constant block. Another input is the altitude to enable the block to calculate thrust at various altitudes. The top level thrust block is shown in Figure 17. It is pertinent to discuss here the lack of thrust data for a given STOL aircraft. Thrust alone has a significant impact on simulation results. Due to the unavailability of the thrust data, the static thrust at sea level was estimated to be 0.3 times the weight of the aircraft. This is within the thrust range for STOL aircrafts. Further estimates will be tested later by running the simulation model.

Figure 17: Thrust Block

Figure 18 shows the sub-system of the thrust block. It makes use of the Atmosphere block that is available in the Simulink library to calculate air density at any given altitude. The total thrust is calculated using the product of static thrust at sea level, throttle setting and a factor of loss in thrust represented by density changes at different altitudes.

3. RUNNING THE FLIGHT SIMULATION MODEL IN MATLAB/SIMULINK
To run the simulation model, a Simulation Initialization Matlab script is required. This script stores the initialization parameters, universal and atmospheric constants, aircraft geometry and thrust data. The initialization script is also needed to run another script called Trimming and Linearization which trims and linearizes the non-linear aircraft equations of motion and gives the stability mode characteristics. The script also solves the linearized longitudinal equations of motions and outputs the A and B matrix. These two Matlab scripts are essential to run the simulation model. Each script is explained below.

3.1. SIMULATION INITIALIZATION SCRIPT
The simulation initialization script is shown in appendix A. The simulation model consists of many parameters, variables and constants that need to be defined and assigned a value. Moreover, the simulation model has to be initialized at an arbitrary condition before it can be run. This is done by defining the necessary initialization parameters or flight conditions that includes a Mach number, initial horizontal stabilizer Hstab angle, initial throttle setting, trim height, trim incidence and initial position. All the initialization parameters needed are shown below:

18

M = 0.22; Hstab_ini = -3; throttle_ini = 0.5; h_ini = T_ini = rho_ini a_ini = v_ini = 0*ft2m; % Trim height (m) T_s + a1*h_ini; = rho_s*(T_ini/T_s)^-(g/(a1*R)+1); sqrt(gamma*R*T_ini); % Speed of sound M*a_ini; % Initial velocity

alpha_ini = 0/rad2deg; % Trim Incidence [rad] q_ini = 0/rad2deg; % Initial pitch Body Rate [rad/sec] theta_ini = 0/rad2deg; % Trim Flight path Angle [rad] x_ini = 0; % m pos_ini = [x_ini -h_ini]; U0 = v_ini*cos(alpha_ini);% m/s w0 = v_ini*sin(alpha_ini); % m/s

The aircraft mass properties, geometry and engine specification give the main set of variables to be used in the simulation model. The mass properties data include the weight, CG and moment of inertia Iyy. For the geometry, key variables are wing reference area Sref, Horizontal tail area St, distance of horizontal tail from CG lt, tail span bt, wing mean aerodynamic chord and the x-distance between CG and quarter chord xwb. All the data is taken from the reference 2.
%% Aircraft Mass Properties, Geometry and Engine Specs mass = 40000*lb2kg; % Weight CG = 40; % CG location Iyy = 21500*slftsq2kgmm; % Moment of Inertia Sref = 945*ft2m*ft2m; % Wing area (in m^2) St = 233*ft2m*ft2m; % Horizontal tail area (in m^2) lt = 3.5*ft2m; % distance of horizontal tail from CG (m) zt = 1.2*ft2m; bt = 32*ft2m; % Tail span (m) AR_tail = bt^2/St; % Aspect ratio c_bar = 10.1*ft2m; % wing MAC (m) xwb = (CG-25)/100*c_bar; % x-distance between CG and quarter chord 19

3.2. TRIMMING AND LINEARIZATION SCRIPT
The 3 DoF simulation model is non-linear in nature. The purpose of trimming and linearization script is to linearize the non-linear equations of motion at a reference flight condition. A linearized model is an approximation to a nonlinear system, which is valid in a small region around the operating point of the system. The script which based on Matlab script for linearization [12] firstly sets operating point and state specifications. The first state specifications are Position states, the second state specification is Theta. Both are known in the model but not at a steady state. The third state specifications are body axis angular rates of which the variable w is at steady state. The script then searches for the operating point in the model, sets input-output (I/O) and then linearizes. Finally, the script selects the trimmed states and creates a linear time invariant (LTI) object. The LTI object is then used to output the longitudinal A matrix and Eigen values. Moreover, the frequency and damping values can also be attained. In summary, to run the simulation model the Initialization script is first run and then the Trimming and Linearization script to obtain all the results.

4. VERIFICATION OF THE FLIGHT SIMULATION MODEL RESULTS
It is essential to verify the logic and validity of the simulation model. This can be done by changing the inputs to the model such as aircraft geometry and flight conditions, and observing the results. The previous two sections explained the logic of the simulation model and the two Matlab scripts required to run the model. This section highlights some of the key results that can be generated at different flight conditions. Following is the first set of flight condition used to run the model:
M = 0.22; Hstab_ini = -3; % Initial Hstab angle throttle_ini = 0.5; % Initial Throttle setting h_ini = 1000*ft2m; % Initial height (m) v_ini = M*a_ini; % Initial velocity

The Mach number is fixed at 0.22. The initial Hstab angle and throttle setting are set to -3 degrees and 0.5 respectively. The initial height is 1000 ft and the initial velocity is calculated based on the defined Mach number and the speed of sound. After running the simulation model at above flight condition, the following results are displayed on the Matlab command window:

The above results are comprehensive enough to study both the static and dynamic longitudinal stability of an aircraft as well as the trimmed states. Running the trim and linearization script generates a report outlining the states, trimmed inputs, dynamic stability modes and the linearized longitudinal equations of motion in the state-space format or the A and B matrix.

22

TRIMMED INPUTS
The simulation model results provide the trimmed inputs namely the throttle setting and Hstab angle, the two inputs of the simulation model. For example, the trimmed Hstab angle is -1.1 deg and the throttle setting is 0.5 for steady motion of aircraft.

STATIC STABILITY
The condition for static longitudinal stability or stable trim is such that the aircraft pitching moment curve must have a negative slope through the equilibrium point [13]. That is,

The Cm can be found using the following relation [14]: Mw = Cm The model checks the static longitudinal stability using the above relation defined in the script.
CMalpha_model = Mw/(0.5*rho_ini*v_ini*Sref*c_bar); %/rad

In the results, CMaplha_model (or Cm) is negative indicating that the aircraft is longitudinally statically stable.

LINEARIZED LONGITUDINAL EQUATIONS OF MOTION
The primary reason to solve the equations of motion is to obtain a mathematical description of the time histories of all the motion variables in response to a control input. This enables an assessment of stability to be made. The trimming and linearization script described earlier finds the longitudinal response to the Hstab input about a trim state. The longitudinal state equation can be written as [15]:

23

The results from the model is:
A = 0.0028 -0.1025 0.0059 0 -0.3088 -2.8342 -0.3712 0 -2.5278 132.3746 -0.1567 1.0000 -9.8088 -0.1563 0 0

B = -0.8951 -0.9673 -0.3406 0 0.2567 0 0 0

It is clearly seen that the trimming and linearization script does an excellent job in producing the longitudinal state equation. We can compare the equation with the one for the known longitudinal state equation (A matrix only) shown below for the same aircraft with a slightly different flight condition.
A = -0.034 -0.308 0.00 0 -0.3088 -2.8342 -0.3712 0 0 65 -2.03 1.0000 -9.81 -0.1563 0 0

24

It is important to discuss the variation in results. Firstly the dimensional derivatives are calculated based on the operating point where trimming is done or a trimmed input is determined. The script has a greater range of aerodynamic data to utilize and calculate the dimensional derivatives. As discussed earlier, the aerodynamic data is not very accurate for the geometry of the given aircraft. Moreover, the thrust is different in our case.

DYNAMIC STABILITY
Dynamic stability deals with how the motion caused by a disturbance changes with time [16]. Once we have obtained the linearized longitudinal equations of motion, it is easy to determine the dynamic stability. Using simple Matlab commands, the eigen-values of the long-period (phugoid) and short-period modes with the associated frequency and damping ratios can be found. The operating point search report shown earlier gave us the following result:
Eigenvalue -1.25e+000 -1.25e+000 -1.78e-003 -1.78e-003 + + 6.92e+000i 6.92e+000i 8.71e-002i 8.71e-002i Damping 1.77e-001 1.77e-001 2.05e-002 2.05e-002 Freq. (rad/s) 7.03e+000 7.03e+000 8.71e-002 8.71e-002

The first two eigen-values are for the short-period mode whereas the last two are for the phugoid or long-period mode. Once the eigen-values are found, the damping, frequency and period are readily obtained. The results are summarized below in Table 1. Table 1: Dynamic Stability Eigen value Phugoid Short-Period - 0.00178 + (0.0871)i - 1.25 + (6.92)i Damping 0.0205 0.1772 Frequency (rad/s) 0.0871 7.0336 Period (sec) 72 0.9

Results in the above table make very much sense. The simulation model is able to produce very useful results to determine the dynamic stability. Both the phugoid and shortperiod are stable in this case with roots on the left side of the imaginary axis. The phugoid mode has a very low damping and frequency and a long-period. The short period mode, as expected, has a very short period and higher damping.
25

HORIZONTAL TAIL-VOLUME RATIO VH
The horizontal tail-volume ratio H is a very important parameter in stability and control studies. The trimming and linearization script calculates H every time it is run using the following relation [17].

=

All the variables of

H such as lt, St, Sref and

will be varied to perform various

simulation cases as described in the next section.

SIMULATION CASES
VARIATION IN WING QUARTER CHORD In this simulation case, the wing quarter chord is varied from 5ft and 30 ft. The given value of aircraft in consideration is 10.1 ft. For each different shown in Table 2. Table 2: Effect of (ft)

value, both the static and

dynamic stability are checked along with the trimmed Hstab angle. The key findings are

The simulation model accurately predicts aircraft behaviour as less stable statically. Cm is negative for all

is varied. It is

observed that as increases, the Hstab trim angle decreases. This is due to aircraft becoming value though getting closer to zero as increases since the increases. Dynamically, the short-period mode stability improves as

roots move to the negative. The phugoid mode doesn't experience much of a change.

VARIATION IN THRUST As discussed before, the thrust data for the STOL aircraft used in this project was not available. Therefore, the thrust was estimated to be 0.3 times the weight of the aircraft. It is essential to observe aircraft response as thrust level varies. Table 3 highlights the stability and trimability results for various levels of thrust as a fraction of weight.

As the thrust level increases, the static stability improves evidently. At a very low thrust level, a high Hstab angle of -4.26 degrees is required to trim the aircraft. It however is reduced drastically at very high thrust levels. VARIATION IN WING AREA Sref It is a known principle that a wing contribution to static longitudinal stability is destabilizing for most conventional airplanes. A tailplane is needed with a proper selection of H and tail lift coefficient. Thus for a given horizontal tail surface area St, if the wing area Sref is further increased the static stability will be compromised as Cm moves toward a positive value. Table 4 highlights the effect of wing area on both stability and trimability. The simulation model was run at three different wing areas. It is clearly seen that as the wing area increases from the initial area of 945 ft2 to 1200 ft2, Cm becomes positive. A higher wing area also leads to a higher Hstab trim angle. Although the aircraft is dynamically stable even at higher wing areas, it becomes statically unstable. This simulation case is yet another example that the simulation model logic is fully aligned with the flight dynamics principles.

VARIATION IN HORIZONTAL TAIL AREA St The horizontal tail plays a very important role in stabilizing an aircraft. It should produce a sufficient counter lift to keep aircraft in steady flight. To observe how the simulation model shows the effect of horizontal area on stability and trimability, three different horizontal tail areas were used for a given Sref of 945 ft2. As the horizontal tail area St increases, the static stability improves since Cm become more negative. Due to this improvement, it is noticed that the Hstab angle needed to trim also decreases significantly from -4.74 degrees to -0.908 degrees. With regards to the dynamic stability, it also improves especially in short-period mode as the horizontal tail area increases.

VARIATION IN FORWARD SPEED Forward speed has a strong effect on both the static and dynamic stability as shown in Table 6. At a low speed of 49.25 m/s, the airplane is very close to being statically unstable and is dynamically unstable in both the short-period and phugoid mode. Also, the airplane is having a hard time in being trimmed since the Hstab angle is quite high. However at speeds of 72.24 m/s and 98.50 m/s, the airplane is both statically and dynamically stable. The airplane is also trimmed at a moderate Hstab angle of -1.1 deg. Table 6: Effect of Mach Number on Stability and Trimability MACH

5. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A basic 3-DoF longitudinal flight simulation model has been built to study behaviour of an aircraft in this project. The simulation model is comprehensive and can determine both the static and dynamic stability of an aircraft. The model also trims the airplane motion and finds the trimmed inputs. The mass properties and geometric data of a generic STOL aircraft were used to predict the aerodynamic behaviour of aircraft. AVL software, an alternative of Datcom, was utilized to produce the aerodynamic data required in the simulation model. The simulation model consisted of three blocks namely Aerodynamic, Thrust and Equations of Motion blocks. These blocks are linked together to form an integrated longitudinal flight simulation model. Initialization script and Trimming and Linearization script were the two scripts used to run the simulation model. The initialization script initialized all the parameters needed prior to simulation and the other script linearized equations of motion and provided the trimmed solution. The results were generated in the form of a report that consisted of trimmed inputs, longitudinal equations of motion (A and B matrix), static stability in the form of Cm and the dynamic stability in the form of roots for both the short-period and phugoid modes. Moreover, various parameters such as aircraft geometry and flight conditions were changed to run the simulation model. The objective was to test the simulation model capability in producing results for different cases. It was observed that the model was successful in accurately predicting the aircraft behavior as either the geometric data or flight condition varied since the flight dynamics principles were not violated. For instance, as the horizontal tail area increases, we expect the horizontal stabilizer angle to reduce. This was successfully predicted by the model. Similarly, various results when obtained for cases in which thrust, wing area, wing quarter chord and Mach number were varied. Both the static and dynamic stability in each of the cases were also studied. It is pertinent to mention that the flight simulation model designed is quite generic in nature and can be used to simulate the behavior of any aircraft. Moreover, the simulation model can be extended to serve any objective. It contains the essential elements or systems of an aircraft that play the most crucial role in any flight simulation model. For instance, the focal point of any flight simulator is the equations of motion block that requires accurate inputs from aerodynamics and propulsion models. Thus this report places an important

30

emphasis on both models. Another salient feature of the flight simulation model is that it is comprehensive enough to conduct the longitudinal stability analysis. The question arises as to how the simulation model can be useful for a designer who intends to design a new aircraft and would want to study basic aircraft behavior. As stated in the section of engineering flight simulation methodology, the process would start by first establishing the system level requirements for the new aircraft and defining the preliminary geometry. Once the geometric configuration is known, the Datcom or AVL program can be used to calculate the aerodynamic characteristics. The aerodynamic data can then be transferred to the look-up tables of the Aerodynamics Block of the simulation model. Once the Block is filled with relevant data, the equations of motion can be solved for longitudinal motion. Moreover, the fidelity of the simulation model can be increased by incorporating the 6-DOF model interface. The simulation model of a new aircraft can also be used for entertainment purposes. A joystick can be used to input commands to the pilot model. An interface of MATLAB/Simulink with FlightGear can be created and a script can be run to play in real time. Introduction of a joystick is the first step of introducing an actual hardware into the model. The simulation model can be further extended to include some other systems to assess airplane handling characteristics. This would require pilot system along with actuator and control systems. Moreover, a sensor block can be added to as a feedback to pilot block and making the simulation model a closed loop system. Figure 19 in appendix E shows a complete simulation model sketch or workflow that includes most of the essential simulation elements or blocks such as pilot, controller, actuator, aerodynamics, atmosphere, propulsion, equations of motion and sensors. Other blocks that can be added are landing gear and aero elastic loads. Finally, the limitations of the flight simulation model should be properly understood in order to improve it. The main area of improvement in the simulation model lies in the Aerodynamic Model. Although AVL provides the basic data for analysis, experimentally determining the aerodynamics coefficients should be the next step to validate AVL results. Another key area is to develop a visualization path to visualize results. This requires installation of FlightGear with high performance graphics card and a valid interface with MATLAB/Simulink. Flight sensors are an excellent way of validating the model due to their
31

feedback information. In essence, the flight simulation model developed in this project can be used as a solid foundation for any simulation study.
