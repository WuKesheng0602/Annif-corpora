Finding Aid for the Set of George Streynsham Master's Albums at George Eastman House Master of Arts, 2009 Jennifer Givogue Photographic Preservation and Collections Management Ryerson University I George Eastman House

Abstract

This thesis is an applied project in which a finding aid was created for the set of George Streynsham Master's albums held in the Richard and Ronay Menschel Library at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. The collection consists of twenty-one travel and autobiographic albums compiled by the English clergyman George Streynsham Master (1823-1900). The albums range in date from the 1850s through the 1890s, and include tipped-in albumen prints, lithographs, paintings, drawings, newspaper clippings, correspondence and hotel receipts. The museum acquired the albums in 1953 as part of the Alden Scott Boyer (1887-1953) collection. My thesis is divided into two parts, the first part describing the process and development of the finding aid, and the second comprising the finding aid itself, which is divided into ten sections: 1) The Creation of the Albums, 2) Provenance of the Collection, 3) Chronology, 4) Scope and Content of the Collection, 5) Album Inventory of Autobiographic Albums, 6) Album Inventory of Travel Albums, 7) List of Photographers and Their Biographies, 8) Master's Use of Nineteenth-Century Guidebooks, 9) Bibliography of George Streynsham Master's Published Writings, and 10) References. The finding aid is accessible to researchers in the Menschel Library at George Eastman House.

Introduction

For my thesis I created a finding aid for the set of George Streynsham Master's alqums held in the Richard and Ronay Menschel Library at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. George Streynsham Master (18231900) was an English clergyman who compiled the twenty-one albums with written accounts of his life and travels; also included are tipped-in albumen prints, lithographs, drawings, newspaper clippings, correspondence and hotel receipts. The albums range in date from the 1850s through the 1890s. Sixteen albums are devoted to his travels in England and Europe, and five are autobiographic albums. All of the albums, with their photographs and ephemera, open up new avenues of research into nineteenth-century travel, culture, photographers, and the activity of collecting photographs and album making. When Master died in 1900, he left his albums to his nephew Charles Onslow Master (1860-unknown), with whom the albums remained for an undetermined period of time until the set was broken up, and sold at an auction in London. In 1949, the albums were acquired by Chicago collector Alden Scott Boyer (1887-1953), and remained in his collection until his death in 1953, at which time they were bequeathed to George Eastman House. Since their acquisition, the albums have not been catalogued into the museum and library database, and consequently have not been accessible to researchers. My thesis is divided into two parts: the first part describes the process of researching and developing the finding aid; while the second comprises the finding aid itself. The finding aid for the set of Master's albums will be accessible as a separate document to researchers in the Menschel Library at George Eastman House.

Part 1: Process and Development of Finding Aid Methodology and Literature Survey Having decided to create a finding aid for the set of Master's albums, which would be available to researchers at the Menschel Library, I needed to do two things: first, determine the best way to structure the finding aid, and second, familiarize myself with the material. On advice from Rachel Stuhlman, Librarian and Curator of Rare Books at the Menschel Library, I began preliminary research into the organization of the finding aid by researching those already in use at the library, in order to establish an appropriate format for this material. The finding aids, for example, for the Leopold Godowksy, Jr. Papers and the Southworth and Hawes Manuscript Collection provided information on the basic structure, including sections on the provenance of the collection and biographical information on the creator. From these, I noticed recurring formats in the finding aid structure, and decided to search for a definitive finding aid standard. My general research began with reading books written about building and maintaining archives, and those books stressed the importance of archival arrangement and description. The arrangement of archival materials is the process of physically and intellectually organizing archives, records and manuscripts, largely based on two principles: provenance and original order. Provenance means that "materials created or assembled by a person, family, organization, or other single source"' are kept together; original order means that archivists retain the "original organizational pattern or structure"2 of materials. Likewise, the Master albums are housed side by side in the

Menschel Library, and are not separated by subject or photographer, as such researchers will benefit from seeing the albums as Master used them. Archival description is used to establish administrative and intellectual control over material through the preparation of finding aids structured in a consistent format. The end result of archival arrangement and description is to make historical records available and accessible to researchers. Finding aids are access tools that describe collections, and provide "information on the contents and context of the records, and a physical description of the materials. " 3 Most books I researched on building archives followed guidelines established by the Society of American Archivists (SAA). Consequently, further research focused mostly on SAA -approved and published books. I consulted the SAA' s Describing Archives A Content Standard (DACS) published in 2004. The book described in detail the standards for archival processes, arrangement and description through findings aids, and provided thorough explanations of terms and procedures. It discussed the differences and merits of using either Encoded Archival Description (EAD) or Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC 21) for electronic finding aids. The Library of Congress' (LOC) website states, "The Encoded Archival Description is an international standard for encoding archival finding aids. The Library of Congress maintains this standard in partnership with the Society of American Archivists." Although DACS was clear and provided a glossary of terms and examples of records, it lacked the conversational style of Gregory S. Hunter's Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives: A How-To-Do-It Manual. Hunter's book was the culmination of twenty-five years of education and

professional activity, and is used as a textbook by archival educators. As a how-to-do-it manual, the language was simple and concise, and standards are explained using case studies. Also, Hunter mentioned the importance of providing a context for and understanding of where the records come from, and the circumstances under which they were created. 4 Accordingly, I began researching the provenance of the collection. Furthermore, Hunter's Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives clarified SAA standards described in DA CS, and the two books together helped provide the structure for the finding aid for the Master albums. Since the albums are held in Menschel Library's rare books collection, they needed to be described using proper rare books terminology. Consequently, two books were consulted to establish the controlled vocabulary, John Carter and Nicolas Barker's

ABC for Book-Collectors, and Matt T. Roberts and Don Etherington's Bookbinding and the Conservation of Books: A Dictionary ofDescriptive Terminology. Carter's book was
co-published with the British Library, and is listed on the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers' website as a book collecting resource. In The Golden Age ofBritish Photography 1839-1900, editor Mark HaworthBooth contextualized photography within English society in the nineteenth century. He discussed the rise of commercial photographers after the invention of the wet-collodion process in 1851, which author Alan Thomas also discussed in his book, Time in a Frame:

Photography and the Nineteenth-Century Mind. Both Haworth-Booth and Thomas
described the concurrent rise of photographers and travel in Victorian England. They discussed travellers wanting to 'possess' the sites they visited at home and abroad,

returning from their trips with photographs of monuments, architecture and local dress. These books helped contextualize the photographers' work whose albumen prints are included in Master's albums. Moreover, I consulted John Hannavy's Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, which offered much background information regarding lesser-known nineteenth-century Italian, German, Swiss, and Norwegian photographers whose work appeared in the albums. In most books about archival description, the authors stressed the importance of consistency in vocabulary, and I used the Getty's Union List of Artist Names, accessible online, to confirm the correct spelling of photographers' names and dates of their photographic activity. Likewise, I consulted the Library of Congress Authorities' Name Authority Headings for proper spelling and dates. In Jan Palmowski's essay "Travels with Baedeker-The Guidebook and the Middle Classes in Victorian and Edwardian Britain," he coined the term "middle classification"5 of travel, to describe the growing popularity of travel for Victorian middle class families. Palmowski argued that the development of train and steamship travel greatly reduced the cost of travelling throughout England and Europe, and consequently opened travel up to the middle class. Also, Palmowski suggested a connection between the rise of middle class travellers and the sudden popularity of travel guidebooks. Reading through the sixteen travel albums, I noted that Master often made references to guidebooks that he used, most often those from Murray's series of handbooks for travellers, as well as the Baedeker guides and Black's guides. In an effort to contextualize Master's travels, I consulted an original copy of one of Murray's

handbooks from 1858, Murray's Hand-Book to Northern Germany. The opportunity to study an actual guidebook gave me a better understanding of how Master would have organized his travels, since Murray provided suggested itineraries that Master most likely followed. Album making in Victorian England rose in popularity with the rise of travel in the 1850s and 1860s, as more and more people returned home from their trips with photographs. In the introduction to their book Photographs Objects Histories: On the

Materiality ofImages, editors Elizabeth Edwards and Janice Hart argued that
photographic albums were "made to look like precious books, religious books, such as Victorian albums with heavy embossed covers with gold tooling and gold edged pages," 6 much like those compiled by Master from the 1850s through the 1890s. In Alison Nordstrom's essay, "Making a Journey: the Tupper Scrapbooks and the Travel They Describe," from the same publication, she argued that most Victorian travel albums housed the same commercially produced albumen prints purchased while travelling; however, it was the personal captions of the album that "domesticated" them. 7 This essay offered insight into early photography collecting, allowing a glimpse into what Victorians did with their photographs. Nordstrom discussed the narrative sequence within albums, and how they were arranged to replicate the travel itinerary. Her article shed light on Master's albums and their narrative sequence.

Process of Creating the Finding Aid

The ideas, theories, and procedures set out in the above publications developed my understanding of Master's albums, and helped me to formulate the configuration and content of the finding aid. In particular, information gathered from Describing Archives
A Content Standard (DA CS) helped to structure my finding aid so that it reflected the

standards set out by the SAA. After much research, I finally decided that the finding aid would be divided into ten sections: 1) The Creation of the Albums, 2) Provenance of the Collection, 3) Chronology, 4) Scope and Content of the Collection, 5) Album Inventory of Autobiographic Albums, 6) Album Inventory of Travel Albums, 7) List of Photographers and Their Biographies, 8) Master's Use of Nineteenth-Century Guidebooks, 9) Bibliography of George Streynsham Master's Published Writings, and 10) References. The most valuable source of information were found in the albums themselves; I spent close to six weeks reading through the twenty-one albums, making detailed notes that would form the basis of my finding aid, specifically the sections 5) and 6) that describe the content of the albums. The nature of the information to be included in these notes had been determined in advance by understanding who would be consulting the collection, and for what research reasons. Known for its photography collection and books on photography, George Eastman House arranges its catalogues and archival materials by photographers' names; the emphasis on photographers led me to believe that researchers would primarily be interested in the nineteenth-century commercial and amateur photographers included in the albums. Knowing the albums' potential users, I

7

decided to highlight the photographers' with a short biography in the finding aid, which became section 7) List of Photographers and Their Biographies. The finding aid was prepared with the goal of making information easily accessible to researchers. Items in the finding aid were organized so that they could be cross-referenced to other sections, thereby helping researchers find the information quickly. Four sections, 1) The Creation of the Albums, 2) Provenance of the Collection, 4) Scope and Content of the Collection, and 8) Master's Use ofNineteenth-Century Guidebooks, were written in a narrative style in order to provide researchers with contextual facts about Master, his albums and Victorian travel. As Hunter explained in his book Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives, "The proof of the finding aid is in the finding. " 8 Accordingly, the finding aid was prepared with specific researchers in mind, knowing what was of value in the albums, and determining the best way to present the information. Therefore, I decided that sections 3) Chronology, 5) Album Inventory of Autobiographic Albums, 6) Album Inventory of Travel Albums, 7) List of Photographers and Their Biographies, 9) Bibliography of George Streynsham Master's Published Writings, and 10) References would be best organized as lists detailing the information in a succinct and systematic way, making it easier for researchers to find what they wanted quickly. Once this was decided, a basic inventory was made for each album as I read each one; the inventory included the album's physical dimensions, its title, inclusive dates, George Eastman House accession number and call number, travel itineraries, page count, general index, parishes where Master worked, and the names of photographers whose

8

work is included and credited in the albums. At the same time, biographical notes were recorded along with any familial information about his parents or siblings. First, I reviewed the five volumes of Master's autobiography, in order to understand who he was, before beginning to read and interpret his sixteen travel albums. In reading the autobiographical volumes, I learned that Master was the eldest of nine children, and his life spanned the reign of Queen Victoria from 183 7 to her death in 1901, which helped to contextualize Master within a very specific time frame. He attended Oxford University, and upon graduation in 1845 he was ordained as a priest and became a clergyman within the Church of England. In 1848, he married Harriet Susannah Hunt, and together they often travelled throughout England and Europe; such biographical information was used to put together the two sections on 1) the Creation of the Albums, and 3) the Chronology of Master's Life. Master recorded his life and travels in notebooks that he later copied into his albums; his interest in archaeology and history led him to write the histories of the different parishes where he worked, as well as his own family history, all of which he published in the form of articles. Moreover, in four of his autobiographic volumes, he included copies of these writings, and upon research on WorldCat, one of the world's largest networks of library content and services online, I was able to identify nine of his publications, which were listed in libraries in England and the United States of America. Given the rarity of these publications, having them in the albums is an asset to researchers, and needed to be highlighted in the finding aid. These are found in section 9) Bibliography of George Streynsham Master's Published Writings.

9

The finding aid was structured so as to offer concise information about the albums in the clearest way possible so that researchers could determine quickly and easily whether the albums offered relevant information or not. Finally, it was the goal of the finding aid to provide researchers with some contextual information about Victorian England, travel and guidebooks, as well as nineteenth-century photographers.

10

Conclusion George Streynsham Master and the twenty-one albums he compiled from the 1850s through the 1890s offer valuable information about Victorian England, as well as about photographic commercial studios operating from the 1850s through the 1890s, and the rise in travel by the middle class. The goal of creating a finding aid for the set of albums was to make this collection available to researchers for the first time. The finding aid was conceived with the specific aim of highlighting parts of the collection that would be of most interest to researchers. In researching books on Victorian England, travel and guidebooks, topographical photographers, collecting photography and album making, I was able to contextualize the albums and better define and interpret the information found in them. From reading guides and publications on archival arrangement and description, I was able to create a finding aid that followed the standards set out by the SAA. The finding aid for the set of Master's albums will be available to researchers in the Menschel Library at George Eastman House.

Notes to the Reader This finding aid has been created to facilitate research and provide supplemental information about the group of twenty-one albums compiled by the nineteenth-century English clergyman George Streynsham Master (1823-1900). It has been divided into ten sections:
1. The Creation of the Albums contextualizes Master's life at the time of the albums'

creation. 2. Provenance of the Collection provides information about the albums' history from Master's death in 1900 through their purchase by Chicago collector Alden Scott Boyer (1887-1953) in 1949, to their donation to George Eastman House in 1953, and finally to the creation of this finding aid in 2009. 3. Chronology outlines the chief events of George Streynsham Master's life, including the dates of his travels, albums, published writings, and parishes where he worked, as well as dates pertaining to his extended family members. 4. Scope and Content of the Collection provides a physical description of the twenty-one albums, with an explanation of the albums' constituent parts and their general layout including frontispiece, title page, general index, texts and illustrative material (including their photographs). 5. & 6. Album Inventory is divided into two sections: the first provides a description of the contents of each of the five volumes of Master's autobiography; and the second provides a comparable description for each of his sixteen travel albums. Each autobiographic volume has been organized and summarized with the following information: 1) titles, 2) dates covered in album, 3) George Eastman House accession

16

number, 4) physical dimensions of the album, 5) general index, 6) index of illustrations, 7) number of pages, 8) copies of Master's writings, 9) parishes where he worked, 10) photographers whose work is included and credited in the album, and 11) notes. Each travel album has been organized and summarized with the following information: 1) titles, 2) dates of trip, 3) George Eastman House accession number, 4) physical dimensions of the album, 5) skeleton routes, 6) general index, 7) number of pages, 8) hotel receipts, 9) photographers whose work is included and credited in the album, and 10) notes.

7. List of Photographers and Their Biographies provides a list, organized alphabetically
by last name, of all the photographers whose work appears and is credited in the albums. Each entry is accompanied by a short biography and the title( s) of album( s) in which their work appears.

1. The Creation of the Albums: George Streynsham Master (1823-1900)

In 1837, King William IV died, leaving no male heir; consequently, his eighteenyear-old niece Victoria (1819-1901) became queen of the United Kingdom. 9 The reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901 was known as the Victorian age in Great Britain. When Queen Victoria took the throne, the majority of England's people lived in the countryside and few travelled from the place where they were born. 10 However, by the time of Queen Victoria's death in 1901, England had transformed from an agricultural society into an industrial one. Technological advances, most notably in the context of this thesis, the invention of photography, railways, and steamships, effected how Victorians viewed and interacted with the world. It was during this period of massive industrial and technological revolution that George Streynsham Master (1823-1900) lived, travelled and assembled the set of albums. Master was born into a family of clergymen; his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father were each successively rectors of Croston, Lancashire. It was common for parishes to be passed from one generation to the next, as such occupations were determined by birth and family connections. In Victorian England, class did not depend on the amount of money that a person had, but on the source of their income, 11 and Church of England clergymen, such as those in the Master family, were considered upper middle class. Coming from such an ecclesiallineage and privileged upbringing, Master studied at renowned public school, Eton College, Windsor, Berkshire before graduating with his B.A. and M.A. from Brasenose College at Oxford University. Oxford excelled

in classical studies and it is here that Master developed his interest in antiquities and archaeology-he was an active member of the Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society and became its Treasurer in 1897. Though not a seminary in the modem sense, Oxford retained close connections with the Church of England, and by the "1850s, up to half their undergraduates were preparing to become clergymen." 12 Master continued the family's lineage within the Church of England by becoming a clergyman upon graduating from Oxford. Throughout his studies and after, as was common to such an upper-middle class clergyman, Master cultivated interests in antiquities, drawing, collecting, literature and travel. Beginning in the 1850s, Victorians began travelling more often, largely through the development of railway networks. In England, the great railway expansion came in the 1840s, 13 and it revolutionized how people interacted with the world, transforming many aspects of daily life. "Before the railways, most people never travelled more than ten or twenty miles from home; all their work, shopping and recreation were done within walking distance," 14 but by the 1850s lower and middle-class Victorians travelled regularly to seaside resorts, and wealthier ones, such as Master and his wife Harriet, travelled throughout England and Europe. In 1851, the introduction of Frederick Scott Archer's (1813-1857) wet-collodion process, 15 in which a glass plate negative freshly coated with silver salts in collodion was exposed and developed, caused the number of practicing amateur and commercial photographers to rise and coincided with the growing demand by the middle-class tourist

market for photographic views of the local and foreign sites they visited. From the 1850s photographers established themselves in such cities as Madrid, Rome and Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), and published photographic prints that rivaled and gradually superceded the production of lithographs and engravings for the tourist market;
16

they

sold albumen prints of street scenes and landscapes, local people, ancient Roman sites, architecture and art. These photographs changed how Victorians were able to remember their travels, and on returning home with photographs of their trip, they compiled travel albums for themselves and to share with others. From the 1850s through the 1890s, Master and his wife Harriet travelled to the English Lake District, Scotland, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Norway. He compiled travel albums shortly after each trip, comprising sixteen in total, later writing "for many years, I have been in the habit of writing journals of the tours I have made at home and abroad, and of illustrating them with lithographs or photographs purchased at the times and places to which they refer" (Vol. I, page 1). In Master's albums the photographs were the same mass-produced albumen prints as are found in other travel albums at this time, but it was his written observations that defined and personalized the photographs. 17 Master never recorded where he purchased the albumen prints, and rarely mentioned the photographs themselves, but he does mention using travel guidebooks frequently. Murray's series of handbooks for travellers and Baedeker guides were two prominent nineteenth-century guidebooks that Master used, and "the Baedeker guides list

a variety of places where photographs were for sale." 18 Master visited local markets and bookshops where commercial photographers sold their products. While the work of more than fifty commercial photographers is included in Master's albums, there are many more photographs that are as yet uncredited. The photographs in the albums range in subject from art reproductions, through architecture, landscapes, street views, interiors and exteriors of churches and cathedrals, to monuments and ancient Roman sites. In 1875 Master began writing his autobiography, stating "it has occurred to me, at the mature age of 52, to desire to commit to paper some reminiscencies [sic] of my Life, so far as I am now able to rescue them from fast increasing oblivion" (Vol. I, page 1). Master explained that his autobiography came "from a series of pocket diaries, in which for the last thirty years I have been wont to take note of my doings, and from an earlier one of my dear Mother's, kept by her from the period of her marriage, I am enabled to ascertain with accuracy dates and other particulars. My memory must do the rest" (Vol. I, page 8). In his five autobiographic volumes, Master included many cartes-de-visite and cabinet-sized albumen photographs of his friends and family, along with photographs of his different parishes and homes. In his fifth and final volume, he included photographs taken by his nephew and heir, Charles Onslow Master, one of the rare times that Master included photographs taken by an amateur. In 1899, a year before his death, Master had his portrait taken by his nephew, which forms the frontispiece of that volume. Master's albums with their photographs are invaluable pieces of material culture, representative of Victorian society and customs; they provide evidence of one of the social contexts in which photographs were used and valued by Victorians. Master recorded his observations and thoughts about the places he visited and his life in general,

and these personal reflections offer insight into the values of an upper-middle class clergyman.

2. Provenance of the Collection After Master's death in 1900 at Bourton Grange, Flax Bourton, Somerset, his estate passed to his nephew and heir, Charles Onslow Master (1860-unknown), who along with his wife Wilhelmina (nee Franken; unknown dates) and two sons George Gilbert (1894-unknown) and Charles Francis (1897-unknown), had moved in with Master the year before in 1899. They continued to live at Bourton Grange after his death, and their daughter Penelope Wilhelmina (1902-unknown) was born there two years after his death. Master's nephew knew and cared about his uncle's albums, as he wrote the final entry in the fifth and final volume of the autobiography, explaining his uncle's death; on the very last page, he pasted in a newspaper clipping of Master's obituary, and had it bound in the same manner as the other albums. After 1900, the history of the albums remains unknown for close to fifty years.
It seems likely that the albums remained in his nephew's possession, but

eventually they were sold at a public auction in London. At this sale the group of twentyone albums was broken up, and purchased by two separate London booksellers. In 1949, the albums resurfaced when a partner in the firm David Low (Booksellers) Ltd., at 17 Cecil Court, Charing Cross Road in London,
19

discovered eleven of the twenty-one

albums in a bookshop, and purchased them on behalf of Alden Scott Boyer (18871953). 20 A Chicago photography collector, Boyer acquired many of the items in his collection through correspondence with booksellers all over the world. He had an arrangement with David Low to purchase photographically illustrated books on his

behalf. The eleven Master albums were shipped to Boyer who was immediately intrigued with them, and requested that Low look for others that might complete the set. Low enquired into the whereabouts of the remaining albums from the bookseller who had sold him the first eleven, who reportedly told Low that the ten remaining albums were still in the possession of the second bookseller at the original auction. Presumably, Low purchased the final ten albums in two separate orders and shipped them to Boyer; the last five to arrive in Chicago were the five volumes of Master's autobiography. Boyer was intensely interested in the history of photography, and had assembled a large collection of historical photographs, apparatuses, photographic ephemera and books on photography. He had been collecting coins and curiosities for many years before deciding in 1940 that he would focus his efforts on the history of photography. In an abandoned bank building in Chicago, Boyer maintained his own museum "The Boyer Museum of American Curiosities" where he kept his extensive collection of photography, 21 as well as his other collectibles, such as "wooden merry-go-round horses, a cigar store Indian, a huge and brand new 11 x 14-inch Deardorff studio camera, Hollywood spotlights on huge booms ... " 22 Prominent photography historian, Beaumont Newhall initially contacted Boyer to further his research on daguerreotypes, thus beginning a "lasting correspondence and friendship. " 23 In 1947, after years of exchanging leads on photographic materials, Newhall, accompanied by his wife Nancy, finally visited Boyer's bank building in

Chicago. Newhall spent three days researching Boyer's collection, and in particular his daguerreotypes by Southworth and Hawes o f Boston.
24

In 1948, Newhall became curator

of George Eastman House and continued corresponding with Boyer and other collectors as he sought out new acquisitions for the museum; his goal was to establish a research facility on the history ofphotography.
25

In 1950, Mrs. Boyer's unexpected death prompted Boyer to write Newhall, "I have decided to quit collecting photography & now is the time to talk if you want the Collection or the Photo Library,"26 and after only a decade of collecting photography, Boyer donated a large part of his collection, including cameras, photographs and books, to George Eastman House. 27 In particular, Boyer's books, periodicals and albums, numbering more than 3,000 items, helped form the core of the museum's comprehensive research library. 28 Boyer's collection ofbooks illustrated with actual photographs was one of his special areas of interest, along with manuals written by early scientists and practitioners in photography. These primary sources often guided Boyer's collecting, since unlike many collectors, he read and re-read his books and albums, often scribbling comments and notations in the margins? 9 These peculiar marginal comments are now known as "Boyerisms," 30 and offer much insight into the material and collection; Boyer signed and

dated all his comments for posterity. Boyer believed the Master albums to be important to the history of photography as the group showed an early use of photographs and offered insight into Victorian travel and culture. After Boyer's sudden death in 1953, his second wife Elizabeth (Betsy) Boyer, bequeathed to George Eastman House the rest of his collection, 31 which included the set of Master's albums among other photographic ephemera. After the albums were acquired in 1953, they were re-housed by the museum's archivist, and stored in the archive collection until 1989. That same year, the archive moved to its present location, and it is thought that at that time the Master albums were transferred to the Menschel Library's Rare Books Collection. However, the Master albums had not been catalogued into the library database, and consequently remained inaccessible and unavailable to researchers until the creation of this finding aid in 2009.

4. Scope and Content of the Collection: Physical Description of Albums
Each quarto volume is bound in leather, with the title printed direct on the spine in gilt; 32 the travel albums, unlike the autobiographic albums, have decorative lines and patterns stamped in gilt on the spine as well as the title. The five autobiographic albums are similarly bound in brown leather, whereas the sixteen travel albums are all bound in blue leather; all twenty-one have book comers for protection in the same material used for the spine, which is a darker shade from that used for the covers. There are lines of gilt delineating the different material of the spine and comers from the material of the front and back covers, which are otherwise plain (Figures I and II). Each album opens to reveal a square binding, and pastedown and free endpapers that are marbled (Figure III). 33 Given the unusual organization of the Master albums, which contain not only photographs, but also lithographs, drawings, hotel receipts, and correspondence, I debated on how best to identify them. I considered two separate terms: albums and scrapbooks. The Library of Congress' website describes photographic albums as "accounts accumulated over time, often private and personal, preserved on blank pages in a book format," 34 whereas "scrapbooks have been a common way of preserving not only photographs, but also newspaper clippings, pamphlets, documents, and other assorted items." 35 Furthermore, George Eastman House describes an album as typically containing photographs and possibly short captions describing each image. Though the

material content of the Master albums resembles that of a scrapbook, their binding and book format far more resembles that of a Victorian album; consequently, for the sake of this thesis project, I refer to the collection as the Master albums. Each album opens with a photographic or lithographic frontispiece, title page and general index. The frontispiece was often chosen to reflect the content of the album, for example his autobiographic albums often open with albumen photographs of Master, or of his home or church where he was living and working during the period of time covered by the album (Figure IV). Likewise, his travel albums open with a lithograph or albumen photograph of a monument or landscape of the country visited in the album; one album in particular, Engadine 1872, opens with a frontispiece of pressed flowers from the region (Figure V). The title page was hand written in Master's elegant script, and some are decorated further with illustrations. Master compiled each general index, deeming it an essential part of every album, and listing the subjects alphabetically by the name of persons, buildings, cities and events with the page number where the subject appears (Figure VI). Throughout the album the subjects from the general index are also written in the margins of the page on which they appear. Many of his travel albums also contain a skeleton route, which appears at the start of his travel albums, before the general index, and outlines his itinerary on a day-to-day basis, and specifies the mode of transportsteamship, train, horse, carriage, foot-by which he travelled (Figure VII). After the last page of text in most of his travel albums, Master pasted in all his hotel receipts from that particular trip, and arranged them by date (Figure VIII). All the albums used the same paper watermarked with "Joynson Superfine," made at an English paper mill company based in St. Mary Cray, Kent run by William

Notes: In November of 1880, his wife Harriet's doctor advises that she not endure another English winter, and Master and Harriet leave on a six-month tour of the French Riviera, Italy, Sicily and Capri. They leave West Dean for Dover, taking a steamship to Calais and the train to Paris; from there they head south by train to Marseilles, Cannes, Mentone, and San Remo. They spend the New Year in San Remo, before making their

73

way to Genoa, Pisa and finally Rome where they spend ten days. From there they move to Messina, Taormina, Catania, Syracuse and finally to Palermo, Sicily. They make their way back through Messina again, Naples, Pompeii and Sorrento to Capri, where they spend a month before moving gradually north through Naples, Rome, Siena, Florence, Milan, Turin, and Paris and finally home. As usual, they visit churches and cathedrals, and Master writes enthusiastic descriptions of geography, culture, cities, landscapes, weather, tourism, antiquities and excavations of Roman ruins. On page 113 of this album, Master wrote, "Judging of it [Palermo] from our own impressions, as compared with the description given by Murray in his Handbook of 1864, we are sure that a great improvement has in the interval between that time and this been effected ( ... ) ." This passage reveals that Master is using an older edition of Murray's Handbook for

Travellers in Southern Italy and Sicily from 1864, when he and Harriet first travelled to
Italy (see the sixth travel album). Also, he mentions using a Baedeker's guide, but he does not specify its title or publication date. Album includes drawings, gouache paintings, lithographs and albumen photographs.

7. List of Photographers and Their Biographies Introductory Note: This section provides biographical information on the nineteenthcentury commercial and amateur photographers whose works appear in Master's albums. The Master albums contain many photographs by as yet unidentified photographers, and this list represents only those photographers whose work is credited in the albums. The list is organized alphabetically by photographers' last name (i.e. Baldus, Edouard) or name of the photographic studio under which they practiced (i.e. Aleo & Davanne ). The Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography (2008) edited by John Hannavy and the Getty's Union List of Artist Names Online were used to establish the names, birth and death dates. Each entry provides biographical information on the photographer or photographic studio with emphasis on what is relevant to the work found in the album(s), and the title of the relevant album(s) are cited.

-AFratelli Alinari
The Fratelli Alinari firm was founded in 1854 by brothers Leopoldo ( 1832-1865), Giuseppe (1836-1890), and Romualdo (1830-1891) in Florence, Italy. 37 Leopoldo Alinari had apprenticed for several years with engraver Luigi Bardi (unknown dates), and learned the new art of photography from him. The brothers' shop sold photographic views to tourists, concentrating on views of monuments and panoramas of cities in Tuscany, in particular of Florence, Pisa, Siena, and Arezzo. In 1865, Leopoldo died, leaving his two brothers in charge of their growing business. Five years later the Alinari

brothers had opened two more shops, another in Florence and one in Rome. 38 Giuseppe and Romualdo ran the shop until their deaths in 1890 and 1891 respectively, at which time Leopolda's son, Vittorio Alinari (1859-1932), took over and ran the business until he sold it in 1920. The Alinari Archives exists still today in Florence, Italy. Photographs of Florence, Italy by Fratelli Alinari appear in Journal of a second Tour in

the South of France and Italy, in the Months of February, March, and Apri/1874.

Aleo & Davanne
Louis-Alphonse Davanne (1824-1912) was a chemist, teacher, and innovator of photographic processes, and a founding member of the Societe Franc;aise de Photographie in 1854. 39 In 1868, Davanne entered into a partnership with photographer Miguel Aleo (unknown dates) who had recently moved from Nice, where he had specialized in landscape photographs; together they sold views of Menton and environs under the name "Aleo & Davanne. " 40 Photographs of Menton, France by "Aleo & Davanne" appear in Journal of a second

Altobelli and Molins

The firm of Altobelli and Molins was made up ofGioacchino Altobelli (1814-1879) and Pompeo Molins (1827-ca. 1893) who had both originally studied portrait painting before turning to photography. They operated a studio in Rome from 1860 to 1865, and sold views of Rome that they signed "Altobelli e Molins."
41

They produced albumen prints of

St. Peter's in Rome that Master purchased when he travelled there in 1864. Though the partnership dissolved in 1865, both Altobelli and Molins continued to photograph independently. Photographs by Altobelli and Molins appear in Journal of a Tour in the South of France

and Italy, in the Months ofJanuary, February, March & April 1864.

See Altobelli and Molins

Amateur Photographers

Master credited many of his photographs to amateur photographers, either family or acquaintances. The pursuit of photography was mainly a "gentlemanly" activity, pursued by those with the education, time and money to take it up. Often these included those practicing in the professional fields of science, medicine, law, and religion. photographers are found in three of Master's albums.

However, these treks into the Alps, as well as other travels in France, Germany, and Italy increased the brothers' debt as opposed to their income; in 1863 the Bisson studio went bankrupt and Louis Auguste Bisson formed a partnership for a short time with French photographer Emile Placet (unknown dates). 49 Master purchased an albumen print ofReims Cathedral, and on its card mount is printed "E. Placet" and "Bisson Freres," indicating that the photograph was produced during the brief collaboration between Louis August Bisson and Emile Placet; the photograph appears in Journal of a Tour in the Tyrol, in the Months ofJune and July,

In 1856, Robert Hills (1821-1882) opened a photographic studio, "Oxford Photographic Gallery," specializing in portraits. 61 However, in 1860 the increasing volume of photographic work led Hills to seek a partner; his former assistant John Henry Saunders (1836-1890) joined the studio and together they formed the photographic firm of Hills and Saunders. 62 Established in Oxford, Oxfordshire, they did much work for the colleges there, including photographing Queen Victoria's visit to Oxford in 1863, earning them an invitation to photograph the Royal family in Windsor, Berkshire. Consequently, in 1867 they were awarded the Royal Warrant, allowing for the "Photographers to Her Majesty, Oxford & Cambridge" to be printed on the backs of their prints. 63 They opened studios in London and Cambridge. Hills died in 1882, leaving his share of the firm to his widow and son, Henry James Hills (1857-1899), who continued to run the firm after Saunders' death in 1890. 64 Photographs by Hills and Saunders appear in Fragmina Vitae Meae, or Some

8. Master's Use of Nineteenth-Century Guidebooks
Master, as did most nineteenth-century English travellers, carried a guidebook with him during his travels and relied heavily on its recommendations; he used the guidebooks from Murray's series of handbooks for travellers, which were published by John Murray III from 1836. 85 In Master's album describing a tour in the South of France from 1864, for example, he mentioned a visit to St. Peter's in Rome writing, "With Murray's excellent and careful description in our hands, by this means nothing escaped us" (262). Master often referenced "Murray" in his journals, sometimes questioning Murray's selection of hotels or commenting on his descriptions. In his album of a second tour in the South of France and Italy in 1874, to take another instance, Master found himself in Montreux, Switzerland without a "Swiss Murray." Knowing nothing of the hotels, he picked one, the "BeauSejour au Lac," which turned out, once Master had visited a bookseller's shop to glance at a "Swiss Murray," was the only one Murray advised against, to which Master lamented, "It is too late to profit by this counsel" (23 738). Murray's series of handbooks for travellers provided valuable hints for travelling, including information on language, money, passports, luggage and dress, inns and innkeepers, and where to find an English Church while abroad. Master approached the local English Church in whatever city he was visiting and offered his preaching skills to the English minister. It is difficult to know with certainty whether Master followed the exact route set out by Murray in his different handbooks. Murray outlined at the start of all his handbooks several different routes that he called "skeleton tours" to aid the traveller in

planning his or her itineraries. Each tour was listed with "an approximate statement of the time required to travel from place to place, and of the duration of the halts to be made at the most remarkable spots," 86 including various side trips that could be incorporated. Master began many of his travel albums with his itinerary outlined in what he called a "skeleton route," much like Murray's "skeleton tours," which listed places visited and on which day. Travelling in the Dolomite Mountains of Tyrol in 1868, Master commented that the "excursions recommended by Murray [were] long and fatiguing," (110) and "the heat was great, and Murray's 3.5 miles grew nearer to ten" (75). Murray wrote the first non-scientific description of the Dolomite Mountains of the Tyrol in his first edition of

Murray's Handbook to South Germany, stating "I explored those scenes of grandeur in
company with a geological friend in 1831-32. Thousands of my countrymen now follow my advice and my foot-steps yearly." 87 Armed with their guidebooks, Victorians toured Britain, Europe and the Near East, gathering knowledge of the world and collecting photographic souvenirs to create a travel account as Master did with his sixteen albums. It is possible that Master fashioned his own albums after Murray's series of handbooks for travellers; both recorded their reflections on architecture, antiquities, churches, cathedrals and monuments. Master, like Murray, referred and quoted from British authors, and romantically described nature, birds, flowers and insects. Master was an English gentleman, well-educated and wellversed in literature, religion, antiquities, art and architecture, and like Murray, reflected these tastes and interests in his travel accounts.
