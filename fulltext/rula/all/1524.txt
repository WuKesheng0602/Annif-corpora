ABSTRACT
An Investigation into Surface Modification of Polyethylene Film by Ozonation Dipak P. Patel
Master of Applied Science Department of Chemical Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, 2008

The aim of this study was to investigate the hydrophilic modifications of the polymer films by ozonation. In this study, the polymer films (LD+LLDPE) were ozonated in gas phase and in aqueous phase, respectively. The surfaces of the polymer films were investigated in terms of peroxide generation, contact angle measurement, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and tensile strength measurements.

Experimental results indicated that the amount of peroxide groups generated increased with ozonation time and applied ozone dose. It was also observed that the efficiency of ozonation was similar for gas phase ozonation, and aqueous ozonation. Catalyst screening revealed that Fe (III) and Cu (II) were both effective in accelerating peroxide generation.

The hydrophilicity improvement of the film after ozonation was confirmed by contact angle measurements and Fourier transform infrared measurements. The LD+LLDPE films kept good tensile strength after ozonation. Even after 120 min ozonation at 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose, 85% of the tensile strength still remained.

IV

The application of catalyst to modify polymer film is the first of its kind. In this study, the approach proved to be successful for LD+LLDPE films.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Polymers are being extensively used in biomedical fields because they are relatively inexpensive, chemically nonreactive and have excellent thermal and mechanical properties. Polymers are used in biomedical fields for medical devices, artificial organs, and disposable clinical apparatuses such as vascular prostheses, blood pumps, artificial kidney, heart valves, intra-aortic balloon, artificial hearts, dialyzers and plasma separators (Ishihara et al., 1999). But most polymers are hydrophobic, and have chemically inert surface and poor biocompatibility, which limit their applications in many of areas (Dasgupta, 1990; Zhou et al., 2005). The hydrophobicity of polymers causes anticoagulation, adhesion and coating problems when used as biomaterials. Polyolefins such as polypropylene and polyethylene have non-polar and highly hydrophobic properties which limit their applications in the biomedical area. Because of poor biocompatibility of polymers, biomedical applications of polymeric material have faced many critical obstacles such as undesirable protein adsorption and cell adhesion. When a polymer surface comes into contact with fresh blood, the blood proteins adsorb onto it rapidly, followed by clotting factors activation, platelet adhesion, activation and finally thrombus formation (Sharma, 2001 ). Therefore, it is very important to modify polymer surface to change their biocompatibility, wettability, adhesion, cell attachment, and many other properties which are vital to modem engineering and medical applications of polymers (Kulik et al., 1997).

- 1-

Polymers are also used in membrane bioreactors (MBR) for anaerobic biological wastewater treatment. The loss of membrane permeability is caused by membrane fouling as the results of inorganic precipitation, adsorption of organic compounds, and attachment of cells (Kayawake et al. , 1991). Surface modification of polymer can reduce fouling caused by hydrophobic adsorption and increase hydrophilicity (Sainbayar et al. , 2001 ). In short, modification of the polymer surfaces can improve properties of polymers for applications in the above two fields.

1.2 Surface Modification
Surface modification is an effective way to modify the surface of polymers. It can be accomplished by various methods (Kulik et al. , 1997; Sainbayar et al. , 2001; Ferreira et al., 2005) such as: Table 1.1 The methods for surface modification Advantages or Disadvantages Low capital cost, Only effective on surface of polymer Increase surface energy, Only effective on surface of polymer Costly method, More maintenance cost Costly method Increase wettability, Complicated process More reduction in platelet adhesion, Not good for complicated shapes Better reactivity than ozone, Maintenance costly Simple and inexpensive, Suitable for complicated shapes

Method for Surface Modification Corona discharge Glow discharge Ultraviolet (UV) radiation Gamma-rays irradiation Flame treatment Activated gas-plasma UV/Ozone treatment Ozonation

1.3 Advantages of Ozonation
By ozonation, peroxide groups are generated onto the polymer surfaces. The peroxides generated are capable of initiating graft radical polymerization of hydrophilic vinyl monomers onto the polymeric materials. Ozonation is a relatively simple and inexpensive method. It is suitable for mass production of modified polymers. Ozone method also has an advantage in terms of uniformity of peroxides on surface of polymers even with complicated shapes (Ko et al., 2001 ). Oxidation of polymeric films by

ozonation occurs not only on the surface but penetrates deeply inside surface due to the diffusion of ozone into the film. The reactivity of the hydroperoxidized materials with hydrophilic monomers depends on the following factors: the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of peroxide, the nature of the radicals generated, the accessibility of peroxide sites and monomer diffusion (Gatenholm et al., 1997).

Ozonation can be conducted either in gas phase or aqueous phase. In gas phase ozonation, ozone gas reacts with substrate. In aqueous phase ozonation, dissolved ozone and ozone gas bubbles both react with the substrate. It is convenient and has more options to use catalyst/ additive to accelerate the reaction in aqueous phase than in gas phase. Active oxygen species (superoxide H0 2 Â·, and Hydroxyl radical OHÂ·) can be generated when ozone is dissolved in water. These radicals are stronger oxidants than ozone molecules and are intrinsic chemical species in the human body. Thus, ozone treatment is recognized as a safe treatment for biomaterials, the treated polymer introduced into the body is not contaminated with toxic chemicals because only ozone and water are used as the chemical substances. Consequently, ozonation is considered Â·to be more suitable for

- 3-

modifying the surface of polymers, especially biomaterials, than the conventional chemical methods (Murakami et al., 2003).

1.4 Research Objectives
The research objectives are to compare ozonation efficiency in gas phase and aqueous phase for polyethylene film in terms of peroxide generation, to examine the effect of different pH value, to accelerate reaction by using suitable homogeneous catalysts and to examine effect of process parameters on peroxide generation with selected catalyst.

2. THEORY AND MECHANISM OF OZONATION

2.1 Properties of Ozone
Ozone acts as a very powerful oxidation agent and is capable of cleaving double bonds in a selective and fast way. Ozone, which is commonly written as 0 3 for simplification, is easily produced and does not need sophisticated apparatus that could be totally unacceptable for normal use. This gas is relatively stable up to 70

oc

and can

decompose in ionic species or other excited species when increasing temperature. Ozone destruction is relatively simple and does not require specific and expensive plants (Robin, 2004). Ozone reactivity is due to the structure of the molecule. The ozone molecule consists of three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom has the following electronic configuration surrounding the nucleus: 1s2 2s2 2p/ 2py 1 2pz 1, i.e., in its valence band it has two unpaired electrons, each one occupying one 2p orbital. In order to combine the three oxygen atoms and yield the ozone molecule, the central oxygen rearranges in a plane sp 2 hybridation from the 2s and two 2p atomic orbitals of the valence band. With this rearrangement the three new sp 2 hybrid orbitals form an equilateral triangle with an oxygen nucleus in its center, i.e., with an angle of 120Â° between the orbitals. However, in the ozone molecule this angle is 116Â° 49'. The other 2p orbital of the valence band stays perpendicular to the sp2 plane, as Figure 2.1 shows, with two coupled electrons. Two of the sp2 orbitals from the central oxygen, forming the angle indicated above, combine with one 2p orbital (each containing one electron) of the other two adjacent oxygen atoms in the ozone molecule, while the third sp2 orbital has a couple of nonshared electrons.

-5-

Finally, the third 2p orbital of each adjacent atomic oxygen, which has only one electron, combines with the remaining 2p2 orbital of the central oxygen to yield two
1r

molecular

orbitals that move throughout the ozone molecule (Beltran, 2004 ). As a consequence, the ozone molecule represents a hybrid formed by the four possible structures shown in Figure 2.2.

Figure 2.2 Resonance forms of the ozone molecule (Beltran, 2004)

The high reactivity of ozone can then be attributed to the electronic configuration of the molecule. Thus, the absence of electrons in one of the terminal oxygen atoms in some of the resonance structures confirms the electrophilic character of ozone. Conversely, the excess negative charge present in some other oxygen atom imparts a

The reactions of ozone with the hydroxide and hydroperoxides ions can be considered the main initiation reactions of the ozone decomposition mechanism in water. There are other reactions that lead to the decomposition or stabilization of ozone in water. Thus, substances of different nature can also contribute to the appearance or inhibition of free radicals. These substances are called initiators, inhibitors and promoters of the reaction. The initiators are those substances, such as the hydroxides ion that directly react with ozone to yield the superoxide ion radical (H0 2 Â· ). The superoxide ion radicals is the key to propagating free radical species because it rapidly reacts with ozone to yield free radicals such as ozonide ion radical that eventually leads to the hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ· ). Promoters are those species that, through their reaction with the hydroxyl radicals, propagate the radical chain to yield the key free radical: the superoxide ion radical. Finally, inhibitors of the ozone decomposition are those species that while reacting with the hydroxyl radicals terminate the radical chain. In last two reactions, reaction products were tentatively proposed (Beltran, 2004 ).

-8-

The stability of dissolved ozone is readily affected by pH, ultraviolet (UV) light, ozone concentration, and the concentration of radical scavengers (Langlais et al., 1991 ). Ozone decomposition rate is first order with respect to both ozone and hydroxide ions, resulting in an overall equation as mentioned in Equation ( 1) (Langlais et al., 1991 ).

2.3 Ozone Reaction with Polyolefins
The reactions of ozone onto polymers lead to numerous chemical modification. The chemical reaction occurred at the surface of the polymer as well as in the depth of material. The main functional groups appeared during the treatment are unsaturated compounds, ketones, aldehydes, acids, esters, hydroxyl groups, peroxides and hydroperoxides.

As shown in Figure 2.3 , the species RÂ·, HOÂ· and HOOÂ· are responsible for the further abstraction of hydrogen from polypropylene leading to alcohol functions by abstractions of hydrogen from a neighbouring chain of polymer, but also and mainly, to the
~-scissions.

Moreover, the radicals obtained can react with oxygen giving

hydroperoxides on the other hand; intramolecular rearrangement produces different species leading to esters and ketones (Robin, 2004 ).

Figure 3.1 Experiment setup for ozonation (Fujimoto et al. , 1993)

Ozone was generated by passing dried oxygen gas through a generator (ozonizer). The ozone concentration in gas was varied by changing the generator voltage and the oxygen flow rate. Then ozone gas was passed to a reactor where polymer films were placed. Polymer films were treated in a pyrex vessel for desirable time and process conditions. After ozone treatment, the films were degassed under vacuum for several hours to remove ozone absorbed in the films.

For above different processes of ozonation, reaction time and ozone concentration were varied and dependent on selection of polymers. The ozonation process described in Figure 3.1 was easy to handle. By ozonation, we can introduce peroxide function groups on the surface of polymers. The longer the reaction time, the more peroxides can be generated. But excessive ozone treatment can make the polymer mechanically fragile.

3.2 Gas Phase Ozonation Versus Aqueous Phase Ozonation

Most of researchers worked on gaseous phase ozonation. For aqueous ozonation, there is little information available in the literature. Kulik et al. (1997) gave comparison

- 14-

of ozone in gas with aqueous solution for polypropylene (PP) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as shown in Table 3.1.

From Table 3.1, we can conclude that peroxide generation increased with reaction time. It was slightly increased for ozonated PP films in aqueous media compare to gaseous counterpart. However, above results are applicable for the tested polymers only.

Graft copolymerization onto SPEU film was carried out at a set temperature with a deaerated aqueous solution of DMMSA of certain weight percent concentration (1, 3, 5, 8 and 10%). The grafting reaction is initiated by adding Fe2+ ions in order to decompose peroxides and reduce homopolymerization. Reaction time was 24 hrs. Reaction temperature, time, cone. of Fe+2 and concentration of monomer were varied to maximize the efficiency of DMMSA. To remove the homopolymer from the grafted film, the

3. 7 Analytical

M~thods

3. 7.1 Determination of peroxides generated on polymers

Amount of peroxides produced on the treated films can be determined by the following four methods.

- 20-

3. 7 .1.1 Iodide method This method involves an oxidation of sodium iodide by peroxides in the presence of ferric chloride. The treated films are kept at 60Â°C for 10 min in benzene-isopropyl alcohol (1 :6, by vol.) solution containing saturated sodium iodide and 1 ppm ferric chloride. After addition of water to stop the reaction, the oxidized iodine is measured as triiodide anion from the absorbance of the solution at 360 nm with the molar absorptivity of 2.3 x 104 1/mol em (Fujimoto et al., 1993).

3.7.1.2 DPPH method The treated films are put in benzene solution of 1, 1 diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH, radical scavenger) and kept at 70Â°C for 24 h to decompose the peroxides. The DPPH molecules consumed by binding to the radicals formed are quantified from the difference in transmittance at 520 nm between the virgin and the treated film using 1.8
x

104 L mor 1 cm- 1 as the molar absorptivity of DPPH. Based on this measurement, the amount of hydroperoxide consumed is calculated (Fujimoto et al., 1993).

3. 7 .1.3 Peroxidase method The reduction of by glutathione (GSH), catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, is followed by measuring the coupled oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH) in the presence of glutathione reductase. An aqueous solution is prepared from reduced GSH, GSH reductase, NADPH, and GSH peroxidase, and then flushed with nitrogen to minimize the autooxidation of GSH. The treated films are placed in the solution at 25Â°C for 30 min and the extent of NADPH oxidation is

- 21 -

determined from the absorption at 340 nm with the molar absorptivity of NADPH at 6.2
x 10 1/ mol em (Fujimoto et al. , 1993).
3

3.7.1.4 Standard Iodometric Method In this method, 25 ml iso-propanol is added to the sample, followed by 1 ml of saturated potassium iodide and 1 ml of glacial acetic acid. Dried sample is immersed into solution and the mixture is heated almost to boiling, kept at incipient boiling for 2-5 min with occasional swirling and without cooling, titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate until the yellow color disappeared (Kokatnur and Jelling, 1941 ). It is possible to titrate solutions containing a peroxygen as low as 1o-4 N to with 0.1 ml using 0.005 N thiosulfate. This method is able to report small amounts of peroxides to big amounts of peroxides (Yuan et al., 2003).

The contact angle (B) of the polymeric surface is measured to quantify the change in its hydrophilicity. Large value of contact angle indicates hydrophobic surface while small contact angle means hydrophilic surface as shown in Figure 3.8. Hydrophilic surface has low contact angle, good adhesiveness, good wettability and high solid surface free energy. While hydrophobic surface has high contact angle, poor adhesiveness, poor wettability and low solid surface free energy. Contact angle measurements are performed us1ng an optical contact angle goniometer (Rame- Hart 100) or Data Physics equipped with video CCD-camera and software (Mao et al. , 2005, Ferreira et al. , 2005). Ferreira et al. (2005) studied contact angle measurement of ozonated PET films. Untreated or ozonated PET films (2 x2 cm2 ) were placed in a closed, thermostated chamber (25Â°C) saturated with water in order to prevent its evaporation. Static contact angles were measured by placing purified water droplet (3 J..1L) onto sample surface from a glass syringe. The readings were stabilized and taken after 1 min of water contact with sample. Subsequently, the water droplet was slowly increased or decreased in volume in order to obtain the advancing or receding water contact angles, respectively. Every

contact angle was determined at four different spots on the sample. It is generally known that advancing angles indicate hydrophobicity while receding ones express hydrophilicity of surfaces. Mao et al. (2005) measured contact angle measurements of OBCS grafted nylon films using a goniometer (Rame - hart-1 00). The water contact angle for each OBCS grafted nylon sample was measured five times by a sessile drop method at room temperature. Drops of purified water (3 J..ll) were deposited onto the modified nylon films,

-23-

and the readings were stabilized and taken in 60s after dropping. Water sessile drops were deposited from a glass syringe onto the samples surfaces, and the water contact angle was measured after a defined period of time, in order to allow the establishment of equilibrium.

3. 7.3 Mechanical strength measurement

Mechanical measurements including tensile strength and percentage elongation at break were measured and evaluated for the treated samples using a Universal Testing Machine. The tensile strength is the stress at the maximum on the stress-strain curve. The tensile strength was determined at a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min. The measurements were carried out according to ASTM D638 type V for membranes (Wang et al. , 2000) as well as Standard Method 2000, D 3822-96 for polymeric fabrics (Michael et al., 2004).

3. 7.4 Attenuated Total Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-IR)

The purpose of this analysis was to examine effect of graft polymerization and to introduce function groups during ozonation. Attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (A TR-IR) is used for analysis of the surface functional groups of materials. Ferreira et al. (2005) performed this analysis for PET films with a spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, model 2000) coupled with an ATR (split-pea) and a nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. One hundred scans were performed with a resolution of 4 cm- 1Â· In ATR-IR measurements, the penetrations depth (DP) of the radiation within the polymer film was calculated according to Harrick equation:

-24-

Where v is the wave number (cm- 1). Nc is the refraction index of the crystal (silicon, 3.42),8 is the incidence angle of the infrared radiation into the crystal (45Â°), Nsc is the ratio between the refraction index of PET sample (1.64) and the crystal. Gatenholm et al. ( 1997) had done this analysis for PP films and microporous membranes with a Perkin - Elmer 1720X Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury/cadmium/telluride (MCT) detector with a resolution of 2 cm- 1Â· One hundred scans were recorded on each sample. Tu et al. (2005) were taken ATR-FTIR spectra with a Perkin-Elmer spectrum One FTIR equipped with a multiple internal reflectance apparatus and a ZnSe prism as an internal reflection element.

3. 7.5 Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) Surface compositions determined from ESCA spectra were used to examine the oxygen content of the ozone-treated surfaces. Gatenholm et al.(l997) performed this analysis for PP films and microporous membranes with an SSX-1 00 spectrometer (Surface Science Instruments, Mountain View, CA) using a monochromatic AIK X-ray source, a detection system with a 30Â° solid angle acceptance, and a hemispherical analyzer. A 5 eV flood gun was applied to compensate for the surface charging of polymer samples. The x-ray spot size (analyzing area) on the sample surfaces was about 1000 J..Lm in diameter. A standard 55
o

take-off angles (the angle between the surface

- 25-

normal and the axis of the analyzer lens) was used for surface scans. The hydrocarbon peak in high resolution C 1s spectra was assigned at 285 eV.

3. 7.6 Protein adsorption test

Protein adsorption test were carried out to learn the extent of interaction of the treated surface with protein in aqueous solution. Bovine fibrinogen was used for preparing protein solution in PBS (Phosphate buffer saline, PH 7.4).
125

I-fibrinogen was

added to pure fibrinogen solution and then protein concentrations were adjusted with phosphate buffer saline to 3 and 1 mg mr 1 for adsorption of Bovine fibrinogen. Protein adsorption was carried out at 37Â°C by placing five pieces of treated polymer film of 1 x i em in 2 ml of protein solution for each experiment. After allowing the adsorption to proceed for 3 h, the films were first rinsed with PBS without taking them out from the protein solution and then blotted with tissue paper. The radioactivity of the proteinadsorbed films was measured with a y-ray scintillation counter. Generally three-four readings were performed on the different pieces cut from the same film (Fujimoto et al., 1993).

3. 7. 7 Platelet adhesion test

In order to determine the potential blood compatibility of the materials, platelet adhesion study is conducted since platelet adhesion is one of the most important steps during blood coagulation on artificial surfaces. The grafted films were rinsed with PBS first and contacted at 37 Â°C, respectively, with freshly prepared PRP (Platelet- rich plasma) of human blood for 300 min and with fresh blood activated by CaCh for 60 and

-26-

120 min. Samples were rinsed with PBS and treated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Then the samples were rinsed with PBS and dehydrated by systemic immersion in a series of ethanol-water solutions [50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 100% (v/v)] for 30 min each and allowed to evaporate at room temperature. Then sample surfaces are gold deposited in vacuum and examined by scanning electron microscopy. Experiments were done three times (Yuan et al., 2003).

In other method, 0.6 mL PRP was placed on polymeric films and allowed to stand for 1 h at 37 Â°C. Then the films was washed with PBS and put into 2 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.5% Triton-X 100 to lyse the adhered platelets. Lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of the lysate was determined with an enzymatic method to count the adhered platelets. Experiments were done five times for same film using different PRP (Fujimoto et al., 1993).

3.8 Effect of Ozonation on Polymer Surfaces
3.8.1 A concentration of peroxide as a function of ozonation time

Fujimoto et al. (1993) studied the concentration of peroxide on the PU films at different voltages of ozonizer as shown in Figure 3.9. From Figure 3.9, it is observed that the concentration of peroxides monotonously increased with the treatment time and application of higher voltage for ozone generation produced a higher density of peroxides. This was because the concentration of ozone increased with the increasing voltage of the ozoniser. But the excessive ozone treatment could make the polymer mechanically fragile. So ozone oxidation time should be optimized such a way to get better efficiency of ozone treatment. It follows that the peroxide production can be readily controlled by the ozone concentration & the ozone exposure time (Fujimoto et al., 1993).

Ko et al. (200 1) studied concentration of peroxide on the PU, Silicone, PMMA and PE films at various ozonation times as shown in above Figure 3.1 0. They observed that concentration of peroxides increased fast at first one hour, then slowly increased, atlast did not change for PU, Silicone and PE films. This might be due to that the film surfaces were almost saturated by the hydroperoxide groups. PU, silicone exhibited a high concentration of peroxide and fast increased as they are soft materials having high ozone permeability. But PE showed low peroxide concentration due to hard and

crystalline. The peroxides increased gradually in PMMA film because of an amorphous polymer.

Ferreira et al. (2005) studies contact angle measurements of pHEMA hydrogels by treating PET with ozone. The ozone treatment of PET was followed by static or dynamic (advancing & receding) water contact angle measurement. The advancing water contact angle is most sensitive to the low-energy (unmodified) components of the surface. The receding contact angle tends to be more sensitive to the high - energy, oxidation groups introduced by the surface treatment (Andrade et al., 1985). From Table 3.3, as expected the wettability of PET surface increases as a function of ozonation time as shown by the decrease in static, advancing & receding contact angles.

Wang et al. (2000) studied FT-IR spectra of virgin and HEMA grafted Polypropylene microfiltration as shown in above Figure 3.15. They were observed that the presence of HEMA graft on the membrane surface was confirmed by the C=O vibration peak at 1725 cm- 1Â· The peak intensity at 1725 cm- 1 was increased with increasing the ozone treatment time suggesting that a larger amount of HEMA was grafted with larger ozonation time.

(1993) showed the effect of ozone treatment time on the graft polymerization of AAm onto PU and PE films shown in Figure 3.19. They were observed that lower graft densities were obtained on the PE film (higher ozone voltage) than on the PU film (lower ozone voltage. They also observed that ozone treatment gave higher graft densities than plasma treatment when comparison was made on graft polymerization performed under the most optimal conditions. However polymer degradation caused by the ozone attack must be taken into account, because the PU film became opaque when oxidized with ozone at 50 v for 60 min. The deterioration of PU by the ozone attack may give an explanation for the decrease in graft density at prolonged ozone treatment (Fujimoto et al. , 1993).

The effect of graft copolymerization time and temperature was showed in Figures 3.21 and 3.22. It could be detected from Figure 3.21 that the great yield increased rapidly at the first 4 h, the graft yield increased with the increase of the copolymerization time. After 8 h, the graft yield increased slowly. It could be found from Figure 3.22 that graft yield were high at 25Â°C copolymerization temperature and low at 55Â°C. This might be due to that the chain termination reaction on the film surface and the homopolymerization of monomer in solution increased with increasing copolymerization temperature.

3.8.6 Effect of protein adsorption on modified surface
Zhou et al. (2005) studied protein adsorption on DMMCA grafted silicone surface under series of monomer concentration as shown in Figure 3.23. Results shown that adsorption of protein decreased drastically at the beginning (2-5 wt% of DMMCA); the amount of protein adsorption decreased slightly when DMMCA concentration increased

- 39-

from 5 to 15%. But when the DMMCA concentration increased from 15 to 20%, the amount of protein absorbance increased on the contrary, it was like that excessive grafting caused protein diffusion into the thick grafted layer region.

Therefore a study on platelet adhesion is the first step to evaluate the blood compatibility of materials. In general, human plasma proteins are a mixture of at least 200 kinds of proteins with different molecular weights and properties, including both platelet adhesion promoting proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and platelet adhesion inhibiting proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulin G
- 41 -

and high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) (Lin et al., 2005). Lee et al. (1998) observed the degree of platelet adhesion on wettability gradient surface in the absence & presence of plasma proteins, platelet adhesion increased with increasing wettability. In contrast platelet adhesion was suppressed on hydrophilic surface in the presence of plasma proteins (Schmaier et al., 1984).

Fujimoto et al. (1993) studied platelet adhesion on the ozone induced modified polymeric surface as shown in Figures 3.24 and 3.25. From Figure 3.24, it was observed that platelet adhesion drastically decreased with increasing grafted density. From Figure 3.25, it was observed that platelet adhesion was decreased with increasing ozone oxidation time. From literature review, it was concluded that peroxide groups were generated during ozonation which grafted with hydrophilic vinyl monomers during graft polymerization. Therefore, surface properties of polymer films were modified. Ozonation can be conducted either in gas phase or aqueous phase. For aqueous phase, there is little information available in the literature. Aqueous phase has potential to add

catalyst/additive to enhance the reaction which an open area for further study.

4. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY

4.1 Materials
4.1.1 Polyethylene film

Polyethylene (LD+LLDPE) film with a thickness of 51 Jlm from Exopack Ltd., Newmarket, Ontario was selected for this study. LD+LLDPE film is manufactured by blending two resins, one is low density polyethylene (LDPE), and another is linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). The ratio of LDPE and LLDPE is 60:40. No coating or co-extrusion layer exists.

LDPE film has weak strength while LLDPE has an excellent strength and impact as well as puncture resistance. By blending both resins, overall film has good mechanical strength which is an important for ozonation. Therefore, LD+LLDPE film was selected for this research. This film was readily available and cheaper than other polymers so LD+LLDPE film was selected for this research.

4.3 The Procedure of Ozonation Process
Â· Polymer films were cut into 1.5 inch
x

10 inch strips, cleaned with distilled

water in sonicator for 3 min and degassed by vacuum for 30 min; Â· Three strips in a row were hanged vertically on stainless steel frame. The strips were tightened by strings from top and bottom supports. The distance between two strips was 1.5 em. Total six strips were fixed in the reactor prior to the start of the reaction; Â· Compressed oxygen gas was supplied to ozone generator (PCI-WEDECO Environmental Technologies, Model GL-1) from the oxygen cylinder. Â· Ozone was produced from ozone generator; flow of oxygen was controlled by flow meter and pressure gauge; cooling water was fed to ozone generator continuously in order to remove heat from the generator;

-46-

Â·

The rate of ozone generation was controlled by adjusting the output power knob; generated ozone oxygen mixture was released in three directions: to the reactor (flow rate and pressure was measured and adjustable), another to be released to exhaust system, and the third to the ozone concentration monitor (PCI-WEDECO); The concentration of ozone was recorded from ozone monitor;

Â·

Oxygen and ozone mixture with 9 L/min flow rate and 14 psig input pressure was fed to the reactor through the diffuser which uniformly diffused in the gas phase or an aqueous in the reactor;

Â·

In the reactor, strips were reacted with ozone at room temperature for set ozone concentrations and for set reaction times;

Â·

After finishing reaction, samples were taken out and degassed by vacuum for 60 min at room temperature.

4.4 Experimental Design

4.4.1 Ozonation in gaseous phase

In order to generate peroxides into the surface of polymer, ozonation was conducted in gaseous phase first. Initially sample strips were cleaned with distilled water in sonicator for 3 minutes and degassed by vacuum for 30 minutes. Then cleaned six strips were fixed to stainless steel frame to avoid overlapping with each other. Then

-47-

polymer films were ozonated for desired process conditions according to the ozonation procedure.

After ozonation, the strips were taken out and degassed by vacuum at room temperature (23Â°C - 25Â°C) for 60 min. After drying, samples were tested for surface analysis.

4.4.2 Ozonation in aqueous phase

In order to generate peroxides into the surface of polymer, ozonation was conducted in aqueous phase as well. For aqueous phase ozonation, the procedure was analogous to gaseous phase except that films were immersed in 11 L of distilled water, and ozone gas was sparged into the water.

4.4.3 Effect of pH on generation of peroxides

The purpose of this study was to investigate effect of various pH on generation of peroxides in aqueous phase. The reaction was carried out with 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose and 120 min reaction time for various pH from 1.5 to 10, and the result were studied for effect of different pH on generation of peroxides.

-48-

4.4.4 Effect of catalyst on generation of peroxides

Since an aqueous phase has the potential to add catalyst to accelerate the reaction, different catalysts were tested with 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose and 120 min reaction time, and the results were studied to find out which catalyst was effective.

In the presence of selected effective catalyst, the effects of the process conditions on peroxide generation were investigated as listed below.

4.4.4.1 Effect of different reaction times

The purpose of study was to exam1ne effect of different reaction times on generation of peroxides. For homogenous catalytic ozonation, applied ozone dose was set at 1.0 wt %, and different reacting times from 30 minutes to 120 minutes were studied to examine the yield of generation peroxide and effect of ozonation on mechanical strength.

4.4.4.2 Effect of catalyst dosage

For homogenous catalytic ozonation, reaction time was set at 120 min and applied ozone dose at 1.0 wt %, and dosage of catalyst was optimized to minimize the amount of catalyst.

4.4.4.3 Effect of applied dosage of ozone

The purpose of study was to examine effect of applied dosage of ozone on generation of peroxides. Ozone reaction time was set at 60 min and applied dosage of ozone, from 0.5% to 3.5% were applied to study which concentration would effective to generate more peroxides and maintain the mechanical strength.

4.4.4.4 Effect of an advanced oxidation process (AOP) on generation of peroxides

The purpose of study was to examine effect of an advanced oxidation process (AOP) on generation of peroxides. The ozonation was carried out with hydrogen peroxide alone and combined with the selected catalyst, to study the effect of an advanced process (AOP) with different concentration of hydrogen peroxide and 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose.

4.5 Analytical Methods
4.5.1 Determination of Peroxides

4.5.1.1 Titration method

The Standard Iodometric method is a quantitative method for determination of peroxides. 50 ml iso-propanol was added to cutting pieces of ozonated films (two pieces of the film with the dimensions of 1.5 inch
x

10 inch), followed by 2 ml of saturated KI

and 2 ml of glacial acetic acid. The mixture was heated almost to boiling temperature (80Â± 1Â°C) with stirring, kept at incipient boiling for 7 minutes with occasional swirling and without cooling, titrated with 0.001N standard sodium thiosulfate solution until the yellow colour disappeared. The consumption of 0.001N standard Na2S20 3 was recorded. The generation of peroxides was calculated.

Peroxide/hydroperoxide reacts with iodide to produce iodine in acidic environment, and iodine can be precisely titrated with sodium thiosulfate solution. Detailed calculation mentions in Appendix I.

4.5.1.2 Optimizing incipient boiling time for titration procedure

Different incipient boiling times were examined in this study. They were set-up at 2, 5, 7, 9 and 11 min. Figure 4.3 presents the results for different incipient boiling times with 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose and 60 min reaction time. It is obvious that boiling the sample for 7 min is enough.

Figure 4.6 Instron Machine

Instron machine (3367) as shown in Figure 4.6 was used to measure tensile strength measurements of untreated and ozonated polyethylene films. By this analysis, we can know effect of ozonation on tensile strength of polymers. For the procedure of testing, speed of cross-head was 10 in/min and followed ASTM D882-02 standard. There are two directions on films, one is machine direction (MD) and other is traverse direction (TD). So five measurements of both directions were taken and average of total ten measurements considered for results.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
5.1 Gaseous and aqueous ozonation ofLD+LLDPE Film
5.1.1 Peroxide generation on film ozonated in gaseous and aqueous phases

The LD+LLDPE films were ozonated in ozone-oxygen gas mixture and in distilled water respectively. For both phases, reaction time was set at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Six LD+LLDPE strips (1.5 in
x

10 in) were fixed in the reactor. The

applied ozone dose was 1.0 wt% for both gaseous and aqueous ozonation. The ozonation was conducted at room temperature (23- 25Â°C) with 9 L/min gas flow rate and 96.5 KPa ( 14 psi g) gas input pressure. The details of process conditions and the results of peroxide concentration are mentioned in Table-1 of Appendix VI (for gaseous phase) and Table-1 of Appendix VII (for aqueous phase), respectively. For titration, the standard Iodometric method was followed.

Figure 5.1 presents the results of peroxide concentration generated in both gas and aqueous phases. Figure 5.1 also presents error bars for each ozonation time with standard deviation. The concentration of peroxide was determined under different ozonation times with 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose. The results show that the concentration of peroxides increased with increasing ozonation time. It was increased rapidly in first one hour and then slowed down. The concentration of peroxide can be controlled by reaction time.

From Figure 5.1, it was concluded that similar results for generation of peroxide were observed for gaseous and for aqueous phase. The peroxide groups were generated

-56-

on the surface during ozonation in both phases. Those peroxides provide active species which initiate graft polymerization with vinyl functional group monomers. It is known that in gas phase, only molecular ozone exists, while in aqueous phase, both molecular ozone and ozone radicals are present. The similar results in gas and aqueous phase in terms of peroxide generation indicate that molecular ozone should be the oxidant responsible for the surface oxidation.

Figure 5.3 Contact angles of virgin and ozonated LD+LLDPE films with 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose, 9 L/min gas flow rate and 96.5 KPa (14 psig) in aqueous phase

The contact angle of the polyethylene films ozonated in both phases was measured to quantify the change in its hydrophilicity. From Figures 5.2 and 5.3 , it was concluded that hydrophilicity of films improved in both phases after ozonation. Similar results for contact angles were observed for both phases. After 60 min ozonation, even though peroxides were still increasing as shown in Figure 5.1 , the contact angle was almost a constant. Perhaps the effect of surface roughness on contact angle was opposite to that of the peroxides because the surface roughness changed after ozonation.

5.1.3 FTIR analysis of LD+LLDPE film

Infrared is a form of radiation that can travel through a vacuum, while heat is associated with the motion and kinetic energy of molecules. Infrared spectroscopy is used

-59-

to study how molecules absorb infrared radiation and ultimately convert it to heat. By examining the infrared spectra obtained, we gained information about the functional groups in the polymer molecules and learned about the molecular structure.

Figure 5.4 presents the infrared spectra obtained for virgin, 60 min ozonated and 120 min ozonated LD+LLDPE film in gaseous phase with 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose. A peak of hydrophilic group C=O for R-(C=O)-R, R-(C=O)-H occurs at 1715 cm- 1 (Kulik et al., 1997) which was created by ozonation and enhanced with ozonation time.

is 21.73 MPa. After 120 minutes aqueous ozonation, the tensile strength of films is 21.23 MPa.

Gu (2008) observed 38% reduction of tensile strength ofHDPE films after 60 min ozonation with 1 wt % ozone. Wang et al. (2000) found that tensile strength of PP membrane decreased with increasing ozonation time. The excessive ozone treatment made the membrane mechanically fragile since ozone attacked back bone of the polymer. The tensile strength data showed similar trends in gaseous phase and in aqueous phase. It was decreased 12-14% after 120 min ozonation in both phases. It was concluded that the ozonation in both phases does not affect significantly on the tensile strength of films. Figures 5.8 and 5.9 present error bars with standard deviation.

5.2 Effect of Different pH on Generation of Peroxide

The effect of different pH on LD+LLDPE film was examined. The pH values were 1.6, 3.0, 5.7, 7.9 and 9.9 respectively. The pH of distilled water was adjusted by concentrated H2 S04 and NaOH respectively. The effect of pH was examined with 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose for 120 min.

Figure 5.1 0 presents the results of peroxides generation at various pH values. In acidic pH, the peroxide concentration was higher. In more alkaline pH, the peroxide concentration was lower. It is known that ozone decomposes more into ozone radicals in more alkaline pH. In acidic pH, decomposition of ozone decreased. The fact that in acidic pH, more peroxide generated indicates that the ozone induced peroxide generation was

- 65-

mainly caused by ozone molecules instead of ozone radicals. This observation 1s 1n agreement with that in Section 5.1.1.

5.3 Homogeneous Catalytic Ozonation
5.3.1 Catalyst screening

The films were ozonated in presence of different homogeneous catalysts including salts of group VII to VIII transition metals, as well as magnesium. The details of process conditions and the results of generation of peroxide are given in Table-1 of Appendix IX.

Homogeneous catalytic ozonation was carried out with 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose and 120 min reaction time. The ozonation was conducted at room temperature (2325Â°C) with 9 L/min gas flow rate and 96.5 KPa (14 psig) gas input pressure. Table 5.1

-66-

presents the results of the generation of peroxides of homogeneous catalysts ozonation with different catalysts. From above results, it was concluded that Mg (II), Mn (II), Ni (II) and Co (II) did not enhance reaction. But the reaction was accelerated by Fe (III) and Cu (II) as shown in Table- 5.1.

5.3.2 Effect of different reaction times on the generation of peroxides in presence of Fe (III) catalyst

Initially 3.67 g FeCbÂ·6H20 was dissolved in 11 L distilled water. The dosage of FeCb catalyst was 0.2 g/L. Then six strips of LD+LLDPE film were fixed in reactor. Homogeneous catalytic ozonation was carried out with 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose for different reaction times. The reaction times were set at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. The pH of solution before ozonation and after ozonation was recorded. After ozonation, the films were degassed for 60 min in order to remove absorbed ozone on films. Since FeCb has better solubility in acidic pH, catalytic ozonation in presence of Fe (III) was conducted at pH 2.9. As indicated by our results in section 5.2, acidic pH

itself enhance peroxide generation as well, therefore, Figure 5.11 presents the results of the peroxides generated with Fe (III) catalyst, without catalyst at 3.0 pH, and aqueous phase with distilled water (without catalyst), respectively. During homogeneous catalyst reaction, Fe (III) solution was at 2.9 pH before and after ozonation. Curve (1) presents the results of the generation of peroxides of homogeneous catalytic ozonation with Fe (III) catalyst. Curve (3) presents the results of the generation of peroxides without catalyst.

In aqueous phase, without catalyst, the generation of peroxides was 0.12 mmol/m2 after 120 min ozonation. At 3.0 pH, without catalyst, the generation of peroxides was 0.1317 mmol/m2 after 120 min ozonation. Peroxides generation increased by 25.3% with Fe (III) catalyst

- 68-

while the effect of pH increased peroxides generation by 9.7%. In short, Fe (III) catalyst is effective in generating more peroxides into the surface ofLD+LLDPE films. Homogeneous catalysts are generally well-defined chemical compounds or coordination complexes, which, together with the reactants, are molecularly dispersed in the reaction medium. Due to their high degree of dispersion, homogeneous catalysts exhibit a higher activity per unit mass. The high mobility of the molecules in the reaction mixture results in more collisions with substrate molecules. The reactants can approach the catalytically active center from any direction, and a reaction at an active center does not block the neighbouring centers. This feature allows the use of lower catalyst concentrations and milder reaction conditions (Hagen, 2006). The relationship between peroxides concentration (Cperoxicte) and ozonation time (t) fits a power function well as shown in Figure 5.11 for catalytic ozonation with Fe (III).

5.3.3 Effect of different reaction times on the contact angles in presence of Fe (III) catalyst

The contact angles of LD+LLDPE ozonated with Fe (III) catalyst with different reaction times was examined. The average of four measurements was taken. The Details of process conditions and results of contact angles are given in Table- 4 of Appendix IX. The contact angle is measured to quantify change in hydrophilicity of films. If angle is large, then surface is hydrophobic, and angle is small, then surface is more hydrophilic. Hydrophilic surface has low contact angle, good adhesiveness, good wettability and high solid surface free energy. While hydrophobic surface has high contact angle, poor adhesiveness, poor wettability and low solid surface free energy.

- 69-

Figure-5.12 represents the results of the contact angles of LD+LLDPE ozonated with Fe (III) catalyst for different reaction times. Initially virgin (untreated) film was 91.05 degree contact angle. Contact angle of film decreased with increasing reaction times. After 120 min ozonation, contact angle reduced up to 67.68 degree.

could get better effect in grafting process by reacting hydrophilic monomers with peroxides which generated during ozonation.

5.3.5 Effect of different reaction times on the tensile strength in presence of Fe (III) catalyst

The tensile strength of ozonated LD+LLDPE films with Fe (III) for vanous reaction times was tested. The details of testing method and the results of tensile strength are given in Table-5 of Appendix IX. Five measurements in machine direction and five measurements in traverse direction were taken. The average of total ten reading was considered. Figure 5.16 presents the results of tensile strength of LD+LLDPE film ozonated with Fe (Ill) catalyst, 1.0 wt % applied ozone dose and different reaction times. The tensile strength of virgin (untreated film) is 24.71 MPa. The tensile strength was rather slightly decreased when reaction time increased from 0 min to 120 min. The tensile strength of films is 21.00 MPa after 120 min ozonation. The tensile strength of films decreased 15% even after 120 min ozonation.

- 73-

It was concluded that the catalytic ozonation does not affect significantly on the

tensile strength of films. Therefore, the LD+LLDPE film is suitable as a substrate for surface modification by ozone.

5.3.6 Optimization of the dosage of Fe (III) catalyst

For catalytic ozonation conducted so far, excess amount of catalyst was used to explore the effectiveness of catalyst. From economic point view, the optimization of the dosage of Fe (III) catalyst is necessary. Different dosages of catalyst were examined. The details of process conditions and the results of generation of peroxides are given in Table-6 of Appendix IX. Figure 5.17 presents the results. It is observed that the peroxide generation stopped increasing beyond catalyst concentration of 0.04 g/L. Therefore, the optimal dosage of FeCb was 0.04 g/L with 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose.

5.3. 7 Effect of applied ozone dosage in the presence of Fe (Ill) Catalyst

5.3. 7.1 Effect of applied ozone dosage on the generation of peroxides of films

Homogeneous catalytic ozonation with Fe (III) catalyst at different applied dosage of ozone was examined. Initially, 0.733 g FeChÂ·6H20 was dissolved in 11 L distilled water to make 0.04 giL dosage of catalyst. Then six strips of LD+LLDPE film were fixed in reactor. Catalytic ozonation was carried out for 60 min at different applied dosage of ozone. The pH of the solution before and after ozonation was recorded. The change in pH before and after ozonation was negligible. After ozonation, the films were degassed for 60 min. The applied dosage of ozone was set at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 3.5 wt %, respectively. The details of process conditions and the results of generation of peroxides are given in Table-7 of appendix IX.

Figure 5.18 presents the results of the peroxides concentration generated with Fe (III) catalyst at different applied dosage of ozone. The generation of peroxides increased with applied dosage of ozone. The generation of peroxides increased from 0 to 0.22 mmol/m2 while applied dosage of ozone increased from 0 wt% (virgin film) to 3.5 wt %.
It was also observed that the generation of peroxides increased faster initially, from

0 mmol/m2 to 0.125 mmol/m2 while the applied dosage of ozone increased from 0 wt % to 1 wt %. Increased ozone dosage could increase peroxide generation, however, the excessive ozone treatment could make the PP membrane mechanically fragile since ozone attacked backbone of the films (Wang et al., 2000).

Figure 5.18 The effect of different applied dosage of ozone on peroxide generation with 0.04 giL dosage ofFeCh, 60 min reaction time and 9 L/min gas flow rate

The relationship between peroxides concentration and applied dosage of ozone fits a power function well as shown in Figure 5.18.

5.3. 7.2 Effect of applied ozone dosage on contact angle of films

The contact angles of LD+LLDPE ozonated with Fe (III) catalyst with different applied dosage of ozone was measured. The static contact angle was examined using a drop of pure water (3 J..d). The details of process conditions and the results of contact angles are given in Table-8 of Appendix IX.

Figure 5.19 presents the results of contact angle measurements with Fe (III) catalyst and different applied dosage of ozone. The contact angle of virgin film was 91.05 degree and the contact angle of the films decreased when concentration of ozone increased. With 3.5 wt % ozone and 60 min ozonation, contact angle reduced to 66.95

- 76-

degree. It is noticed that even though peroxide concentration kept increasing with ozone applied dose (Figure 5.18), the contact angle of the LD+LLDPE film is almost a constant beyond ozone concentration 2.0 wt%.

Contact angle indicates the characteristic of the outermost surfaces while the concentration of peroxide included those inside the material as well as on the surface (Ko et al., 2001 ). Therefore, it is possible that peroxides were not generated only from the surface but throughout the whole specimen. Another possible reason for the different trends in peroxide concentration and contact angle with ozone dosage could be that when ozone dosage at certain level, the surface roughness played negative role in the decrease the contact angle.

5.3. 7.4 Effect of applied ozone dosage on tensile strength of films

The tensile strength of ozonated LD+LLDPE films with Fe (Ill) catalyst and various applied dosage of ozone were tested. The details of testing method and the results of tensile strength are given in Table-9 of Appendix-IX. Five measurements in machine direction (MD) and five measurements in traverse direction (TD) were recorded. The average of total ten reading was recorded.

Figure 5.23 presents results of tensile strength measurements. The tensile strength of the virgin film is 24.71 MPa. The tensile strength was gradually decreased when concentration of ozone increased from 0 wt % (virgin film) to 3.5 wt %. The tensile strength of films ozonated with 3.5 wt% ozone and 60 min decreased up to 18.31 MPa.

- 80-

The tensile strength of films was decreased by 25.9% when ozonation concentration was

3.5 wt %. Combining results in Figure 5.18 and 5.23, it looks like that ozonation of the
film at 2.0 wt% for 60 min is appropriate both in generating peroxides and maintaining good mechanical strength. At this point, tensile strength decreased only by 14.6o/o.

5.3.8 Ozonation with Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP)

The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are responsible for generating more OHÂ· radicals when reacts with ozone during ozonation. 0 3/H 20 2 , 03/UV and 0 3/H 2 0 2 /UV are well known advanced oxygen processes (AOPs). In this study, hydrogen peroxide (H2 0 2) was dissolved in distilled water to conduct advanced ozonation. The

- 81 -

AOP process was conducted in absence of catalyst first. The applied ozone dose was 1 wt % and the reaction time was 60 min. Molar concentration (or molarity) of H202 was set to be 0.005, 0.023 and 0.045 M, respectively. Calculation of molar concentration of
H202 is given in Appendix X. The details process conditions and the results of generation

of peroxides are given in Appendix XI.

Figure 5.24 presents the results of the generation of peroxides with different molar concentration of H 20 2. When concentration of H 202 increased from 0 to 0.045 M, the concentration of peroxide decreased from 0.098 mmol/m2 to 0.047 mmol/m
2 .

The advanced ozonation was also carried out with H 2 0 2 and Fe (III) catalyst together. The details of process conditions and the results of peroxides generated are given in Appendix XII. It was found that (data not shown) when concentration of peroxide with constant 0.4 g/L dosage of Fe (III) catalyst increased from 0.005 M to 0.045 M, the concentration of peroxide decreased from 0.11 mmol/m to 0.062 mmol/m

H20 2 concentration (M)

Figure 5.24 The generation of peroxide of films ozonated with 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose, 9 L/min ozone rate and 60 min reaction time for different molar of H202

In the ozonation with hydrogen peroxide, ozone decomposed and reacted with hydrogen peroxide ultimately, generated hydroxyl radicals. These radicals might be effective for ozonation of waste water, but might not effective for ozonation of polymer films. As discussed earlier, molecular ozone is responsible for generating peroxides into the polymer surface during ozonation. With higher concentration of H202, more molecular of ozone reacted with hydrogen peroxide and generated more hydroxyl radicals resulting lower peroxides generation. So above results of AOP are in agreements with our previous results. The relationship between peroxides generation and concentration of hydrogen peroxide fits an exponential function well as shown in Figure 5.24.

5.4 Aging Test on the Treated LD+LLDPE Films

The aging test was performed to check stability of the peroxides generated by ozonation. Three samples were selected, one was from gaseous ozonation, one was from aqueous ozonation, and another was from catalytic ozonation with Fe (Ill) catalyst. The process conditions during ozonation were the same for all three samples. The films were examined for the concentration of peroxide immediately after ozonation, and 30 days after ozonation. Table 5.2 presents the results for aging test. It can conclude that the generated peroxides were stable.

6. CONCLUSIONS
Peroxide groups were successfully generated on LD+LLDPE films by ozonation both in gaseous phase and in aqueous phase. The efficiency of the generation of peroxides had no significant difference between gas phase and aqueous ozonation with 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose.

pH was found to have effect on ozonation. In aqueous ozonation, lowering the pH enhanced peroxide generation by 14 %.

In aqueous phase ozonation, addition of soluble catalysts increased the generation of peroxides. Catalyst screening from salts of transitional metals of group VII and group VIII as well as magnesium, resulted in two effective catalysts, Fe (III). The minimum dosage of FeCb was found to be 0.04 giL with 1.0 wt% applied ozone dose.

In addition to the direct peroxide concentration measurement, FTIR analyses, and contact angle measurements were conducted. The FTIR spectra demonstrated that hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were added onto the polymer films by ozonation. The density of these groups increased with the treatment time and applied dosage of ozone. The results of contact angle measurements demonstrated the improvement of hydrophilicity of films.

Tensile strength measurements were also conducted. Ozonation did not significantly affect the mechanical strength of the tested films. Even after 120 m1n

- 85-

ozonation at 1 wt% applied ozone dose, 85% of the tensile strength still remained. The combination of 2.0 wt % and 60 min ozonation seems optimal for a good balance of peroxides generation and the film mechanical strength.

A novel approach of treat LD+LLDPE film, i.e., aqueous ozonation in presence of catalyst was applied successfully in this study.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS

Â·

LD+LLDPE (Polyethylene) films ozonated by homogeneous catalytic ozonation with Fe (III) catalyst should be grafted with monomers in graft polymerization. These results should be compared with the results obtained through ozonation in aqueous phase (without catalysts) and its graft polymerization.

Â·

Our preliminary results showed Cu (II) was effective to accelerate the reaction. The effect of different process parameters could be studied for ozonation of LD+LLDPE films with Cu (II) catalyst.

Â·

Other catalysts like as Ag (1), Ti (II) and Zn (II) could be studied for homogeneous catalytic ozonation.

Â·

UV could be combined with ozone treatment, and could be studied for ozonation with Fe (III) catalyst.

Â·

Other polymer films such as PET, PU, PP and HDPE could be ozonated with Fe (III) catalyst.

Â·

The protein adsorption test and the platelet adhesion test are most important for biomedical applications. So, these tests could be studied for catalytic ozonation followed by graft polymerization.
