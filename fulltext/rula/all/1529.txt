MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF LASER WELDED  DUALPHASE STEEL JOINTS 
Naheen Farabi  MASc., Mechanical Engineering  Ryerson University, Toronto, 2010 

ABSTRACT 
The  application  of  dual  phase  (DP)  steels  in  the  automobile  industry  unavoidably  involves  welding operation. The objective of this thesis was to study the  microstructure and  mechanical  properties  of laser  welded  DP  steel  joints.  The  laser  welding  resulted  in  a  significant  hardness  increase  in the  FZ  but the formation of a soft zone  in the heat affected zone (HAZ). While the  soft zone influenced the tensile properties of the joints considerably, the fatigue properties of the  welds showed dependence on both the softening and the applied stress amplitudes. Fatigue crack  was  observed  to  initiate  from  the  specimen  surface  and  crack  propagation  was  basically  characterized  by  striationlike  features.  Postweld  heat  treatment  was  found  to  eradicate  the  negative  effect of the  soft zone and  improve the  mechanical properties of  welds. However, the  heat treatment resulted in a brittle fracture mode from the dominating ductile mode of fracture of  the welded joints.

Chapter 1  Introduction 

Increasing concern of environmental safety and reduction of fuel consumption motivate car  manufacturers  to  use  new  lightweight  materials  having  a  higher  tensile  strength  coupled  with  better  ductility.  By  reducing  the  weight  of  a  car,  less  fuel  consumption  along  with  less  CO2  emission can be achieved. Considering the safety standards required in the automobile industry,  advanced high strength steels (AHSS) can be an auspicious solution as these steels have a higher  tensile  strength,  in  conjunction  with  higher  elongation,  compared  to  the  conventional  steels  of  similar  yield  strength [1]. It has  been shown  in a case study of the world  steel association that  replacing conventional steels with AHSS for the car body resulted in 17% to 25% mass savings  which corresponded to a total vehicle weight reduction of 9%. This reduction in the vehicle mass  leads  to  a  reduction  in  fuel  consumption  and  GHG  emission  by  5.1%  and  5.7%,  respectively,  over the  full  life cycle of the vehicle.  When applied to a typical fivepassenger  family car, this  would  result  in  an  overall  reduction  in  the  car  weight  by  117  kg,  corresponding  to  a  lifetime  saving of 2.2 tonnes of CO2  equivalents per vehicle [2].  Dual phase (DP) steel is a member of the family of AHSS. The microstructure of DP steel  consists of soft and ductile ferrite matrix which is strengthened by a hard martensitic phase and  possibly  bainitic phase with an  addition of a  very  little amount of retained austenite [37]. The  ductility of the  steel arises  from  ferrite and the  martensite accounts  for the strength. Compared  with high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels, DP steel shows slightly lower yield strength but the  continuous flow behavior in dual phase steel results in larger and more uniform total elongation  and a higher initial work hardening rate, along with considerably higher ultimate tensile strength
1 

[8]. All these favorable mechanical characteristics have made DP steel intriguing to automobile  manufacturers.  It  is  often  stated  that  more  than  50%  of  a  country's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  related to welding  in one way or another [9] and  in the case of the automobile  body  structure,  welding  is  the  most  used  joining  operation.  In  previous  auto  body  designs,  the  most  typical  material  used  was  mild  steel.  These  car  bodies  were  assembled  via  resistance  spot  welding  (RSW),  a  method  which  fulfilled  the  demand  of  automobile  manufacturers  for  high  process  speed  and  high  volume  scenario.  But,  due  to  the  changed  material  scenario,  other  welding  methods  are  also  gaining  popularity  in  the  industry.  Due  to  ease  of  automation  and  flexibility,  laser welding  has  already  gained  its reputation  in the  metal  joining  field.  A  lot of work can  be  found  on  the  laser  welding  of  DP  steel  coupled  with  the  effect  of  welding  on  the  tensile  properties [10,11]. But very limited studies on the fatigue properties of these kinds of joints have  been  reported.  In  structural  applications,  laser  welded  joints  would  be  prone  to  failure  under  cyclic  loading  conditions,  so  the  characterization  of  fatigue  resistance  of  the  welded  joints  is  necessary.  Previous studies on DP steels showed that the welding led to the formation of a soft zone in  the subcritical area of the heataffected zone (HAZ), and the mechanical properties of the welded  joints were  significantly affected by this area [12,13]. The tensile properties and  formability of  the welded joints were seriously hindered by the formation of this softened zone [1215]. Then  the questions arose on whether the soft zone would lead to a reduction in the fatigue resistance  and to what extent. Detailed  studies concerning the  fatigue properties and the effect of the soft  zone on the failure behavior of the welded DP joints are lacking. For the effective applications of

2 

DP  steels,  a  comprehensive  study  of  their  fracture  characteristics  and  mechanisms  under  both  monotonic and cyclic loads is of vital importance.  Therefore,  the  present  study  was  aimed  at  evaluating  the  microstructure  and  mechanical  properties with an emphasis on the failure mechanisms of the laser welded DP steel joints under  both monotonic and cyclic loading. This investigation also involves developing an effective post  weld heat treatment procedure to overcome the negative effect of the soft zone and improve the  mechanical properties.  A  literature  survey  is  presented  in  Chapter  2  where  a  brief  overview  on  advanced  high  strength steels (AHSS) & laser welding is followed by the previous research work evaluating the  mechanical properties of laser welded DP steel joints and the significance and aim of this work.  Chapter 3 explains the experimental procedures involved in this study. Chapter 4 depicts the test  results obtained in this work, in conjunction with a corresponding discussion. Chapter 5 presents  conclusions and the future scope of this work.

Chapter 2  Literature Review 

2.1  2.1.1 

Advanced high strength steels (AHSS)  Advanced high strength steels background 

Automotive  steels  can  be  classified  in  several  different  ways.  One  is  a  metallurgical  designation.  The  common  designation  includes  low  strength  steels,  conventional  high  strength  steels  (HSS)  and  the  newer  types  of  advanced  high  strength  steels  (AHSS).  The  principal  difference  between  the  conventional  HSS  and  the  AHSS  is  their  microstructure.  Conventional  HSS  are  the  single  phase  ferritic  steels  (such  as  carbonmanganese,  bake  hardenable,  high  strength  interstitial  free  and  high  strength  low  alloy  steels).  On  the  other  hand,  AHSS  are  primarily  steels  with  a  microstructure  containing  a  phase  other  than  ferrite  or  pearlite  such  as  martensite, bainite, austenite and/or retained austenite in quantities sufficient to produce unique  mechanical properties. Some types of AHSS have a higher strain hardening capacity resulting in  a strength ductility balance superior to conventional steels. Other types have ultra high yield and  tensile  strength  and  show  a  bake  hardening  behavior.  All  AHSS  are  commonly  produced  by  controlling the cooling rate from the austenite or austenite plus ferrite phase, either on the run out  table or hot mill (for hot rolled products) or in the cooling  section of the continuous annealing  furnace (continuously annealed or hot dipped products) [1].  The common types of AHSS are: dual phase (DP) steels, transformation induced plasticity  (TRIP)  steels,  complex  phase  (CP)  steels,  martensitic  (MS)  steels,  ferritic  bainitic  (FB)  steels,  twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steels.

DP steels normally contain dispersed  islands of  martensite  in the  ferrite matrix [5,1620].  The  ductility  arises  from  ferrite,  while  martensite  accounts  for  the  strength.  Usually  ferrite  martensite DP  steels are produced by  intercritical annealing  followed  by rapid cooling [21,22].  During the intercritical annealing small pools of austenite are formed in the ferrite matrix, which  subsequently  transform  into  martensite  upon  rapid  cooling.  The  austenitetomartensite  transformation,  accompanied  by  a  volume  expansion,  leads  to  mobile  dislocations  into  the  surrounding ferritic matrix. The mobility of these dislocations is responsible for the high initial  work hardening rate and continuous deformation behavior in the DP steels [16,22].  The excellent combination of higher tensile strength with significant ductility resulted into  better acceptance of these steels compared to conventional steels. DP steels also exhibits higher  initial  work  hardening  rate,  higher  ultimate  tensile  strength  and  lower  YS/UTS  ratio  than  the  similar yield strength of HSLA (high strength low alloy) steel. Another benefit of DP steels over 
*  the conventional steels is the bake hardening effect  . In DP steels, carbon enables the formation 

of  martensite at practical cooling rates by  increasing the  hardenability of the  steel. Manganese,  chromium,  nickel  and  vanadium  are  added  individually  or  in  combination  to  increase  the  hardenability as well.  Carbon also  strengthens the  martensite  as  a  ferrite solute strengthener as  silicon  or  phosphorus  does.  These  additions  are  carefully  balanced  to  not only  produce  unique  mechanical properties but also maintain better weldability [1].

Laser welding overview 

2.2.1 

Introduction to laser welding 

Laser  welding  is  a  process  by  which  heat  is  generated to  join  metals  by  using  a  focused  laser beam. The laser is a device that produces a concentrated coherent light beam by stimulating  electronic or molecular transitions to lower energy levels. Laser welding can be done by using or  not using a shielding gas and also it is used with or without the application of the pressure. Laser  welding  represents  a  delicate  balance  between  heating  and  cooling  within  a  spatially  localized  volume  overlapping  two  or  more  solids  such  that  a  liquid  pool  is  formed  and  remains  stable  under solidification. The objective of laser welding is to create the liquid melt pool by absorption  of incident radiation, allow it to grow to desired size and then propagate this melt pool through  the solid interface eliminating the original seam between the components to be joined [23].  The two fundamental modes of laser welding are: a) conduction welding and b) keyhole or  penetration  welding.  The  basic  difference  between  these  two  modes  is  that  the  surface  of  the  weld pool remains unbroken during conduction welding and opens up to allow the laser beam to  enter the melt pool in keyhole welding. Conduction welding is less susceptible to gas entrapment  during welding as the laser radiation does not penetrate into the material being weld whereas in  the  keyhole  welding  the  intermittent  closure  of  the  keyhole  can  result  in  porosity  [23].  The  schematic diagrams of these two modes are given  in Figure 2.1. The portion of the work piece  which  is  actually  get  melted  during  welding  is  called  the  fusion  zone  (FZ).  The  portion  of  the  work  piece  which  does  not  melt  but  get  affected  by  the  heat  generated  in  FZ  is  called  heat  affected zone (HAZ).

Types of laser 

There are two basic types of  lasers used  in  metal  joining. These are the solid  state lasers  and  gas  lasers.  Solid  state  laser  uses  a  solid  medium  whereas  the  gas  lasers  use  a  mixture  of  helium, nitrogen and CO2  in the tube. The most commonly used gaseous laser is CO2  laser. The  widely used solid state lasers are YAG laser, diode laser, disk laser, fiber laser, etc. Although the  gas laser usually generates high power, the solid state lasers are reputed for higher efficiency and  better weld properties [24]. 

2.2.3 

Laser welding parameters 

The weld quality depends on the laser parameter extensively. By manipulating these laser  parameters the manufacturer can have good weld joints. Some primary laser welding parameters  are discussed below in brief. 

7 

The  term  laser  modes  describe  the  distribution  of  laser  intensity  within  the  beam.  For  instance the transverse  mode or distribution of  intensity  in the plane perpendicular to the optic  axis is determined by the nature of the mirrors used in the laser construction. There are four types  of  laser  modes:  stable,  unstable,  wavelength  and  hybrid  stableunstable.  Lasers  are  invariably  rated  by  their  power  output,  measured  in  watts  or  kilowatts.  This  rating  refers  to  the  power  generated  at  the  output  mirror  or  window  of  the  laser  and  is  usually  measured  by  an  internal  power meter and displayed on a mirror. In case of pulsed laser, the relevant parameter is not the  power but the energy per pulse, which is similarly diminished between the laser output and the  work piece [24].  The  beam  width  is  defined  as  the  diameter  of  a  circle  that  includes  up  to  85%  of  total  power of the beam. The quality of a beam is measured by its ability to be focused to a small spot  size, raising the intensity or power per unit area (or energy per unit area for pulsed beams) to a  high  value  to  do  useful  work.  The  beam  diameter  at  the  focus,  also  called  the  spot  size  determines not only the fitness of the features that can be cut or welded but also determines the  intensity  or  power  per  unit  area  at  the  focus.  Considering  the  material  which  will  be  welded,  welding speed is a very important parameter. This parameter means how much distance the laser  beam will cover per unit time while welding. Laser welding is normally an autogenous welding  procedure which means no filler material is usually used. However filler materials can be used to  relax  the  edge  preparation  of  the  pieces  and  also  to  improve  the  weld  metallurgy.  Usually  shielding gas is used to protect the weld from oxidation and contamination [24]. Depending upon  the type of materials to be welded, the positioning of the focal beam of the laser was also found  to play a dominant role for steel joints [25].

Recent studies on laser welded DP steel joints 

As  mentioned  earlier, about half of a  country's  GDP  is related to welding  and  joining  in  one  way  or  another  and  in  the  case  of  autobody  structures  welding  is  the  mostwidely  used  joining  operation,  it  is  obvious  to  find  considerable  amount  of  research  work  on  welding  processes  of  automotive  steels.  A  significant  amount  of  work  has  been  conducted  on  the  mechanical property of the welded DP steel joined by other welding processes, such as resistance  spot  welding  (RSW)  [2628],  laser  spot  welding  (LSW)  [29],  gas  metal  arc  welding  (GMAW)  [30],  and  friction  stir  welding  [31].  Mentionable  work  can  be  found  on  the  tensile  properties  [4,11] and formability [12,13,15] of the laser welded DP steel joints as well. A brief background  related  to  the  previous  studies  on  laser  welded  DP  steel  joints  is  described  in  the  following  sections. 

2.3.1 

Effect of welding on the microstructure 

The microstrucrtural matrix of soft ferrite is strengthened with metastable hard martensite  and possibly bainitic phase particles in the dual phase steel [4,5,19,20,32] (Fig. 2.2(a)). Previous  studies  pertaining  to  laser  welding  of  DP  steel  joints  showed  formation  of  mostly  martensitic  structure in the fusion zone as that area experiences very high cooling rate during solidification  corresponding  to  the  optical  micrograph  representing  the  FZ  microstructure  of  laser  welded  DP980 joints shown in Fig. 2.2(b). The HAZ just outside the fusion boundary is heated above the  austenitic  transition  temperature  and  upon  cooling  forms  a  hardened  microstructure  that  generally consists of  lower transformation products of  martensite and  bainite. Further  from the  fusion boundary, the maximum local temperature is too low to produce austenite but exposure to
9 

elevated  temperature  results  in  tempering  of  the  martensite  phase  and  leads  to  a  soft  microstructure  [12].  This  soft  microstructure  is  believed  to  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  mechanical properties of laser welded DP steel joints.

2.3.2 

Microhardness profile and formation of soft zone 

Due  to  formation  of  mostly  martensitic  structure  in  the  fusion  zone,  it  shows  higher  hardness  values  compared  to  base  metal.  However,  recent  studies  showed  that  the  welding  led  to  formation of a soft zone in the subcritical area of the heat effected zone (HAZ) which is typically  referred to as HAZ softening [4,13,14]. This softening is believed to occur due to the tempering  of  preexisting  martensite  phase  during  the  welding  process  [4,1315].  In  this  region,  the  peak  temperature during the welding cycle was below the Ac1  temperature (the critical temperature for  reaustenisation during heating process), and as a result, no austenisation of the C rich martensite  phase  occurred.  The  high  temperature  exposure  promoted  martensite  decomposition  [15].  The 

10 

fusion zone hardness was found to increase with increasing heat input by the laser [4]. Figure 2.3  shows the hardness profile of three different grades of dual phase steel welded by two different  types of welding.

(b)

Hardness  profile  across  welds:    (a)  Nd:YAG  laser  welding  with  6m/min  and  (b) 

diode laser welding with speed of 1.3 m/min [4]. 

The welding parameters and volume fraction of base metal martensite have a major effect  on  this  softening  phenomenon  [4,33].  With  higher  strength  grades  of  DP  steels  the  degree  of  softening usually  increases (Fig. 2.3). The HAZ  softened region  becomes  smaller  in width and  depth  as  welding  speed  increases  due  to the  reduced  heat  input  at  higher  welding  speeds.  The  reduced heat input shortens the thermal cycle so that it cannot fully temper the martensite in the  dual phase steel [33]. Table 2.1 shows the effect of welding speed, type of laser and laser specific  energy  on  hardened  and  softened  zone  widths.  According  to  Uchihara  and  Fukui  [34]  this  hardness  change  or  softening  is  caused  by  the  unstable  microstructure  during  welding  thermal  cycle  where  it  should  be  mentioned  that  these  DP  steels  are  produced  through  a  controlled  thermal cycle to obtain hard microstructure in steel production mill.

Studies on mechanical properties 

The  tensile  strength  of  DP  steels  has  a  relationship  with  the  hardness.  Huh  et  al.  [35]  conducted a detailed study on the dynamic tensile test characteristics of DP600 and DP800 steels  along with similar grades of TRIP steels and observed that DP type steels are more sensitive to  strain rate compared with TRIP type steel but the work hardening rate of these steels are not that  much sensitive to the strain rate. They also reported that the elongation of DPtype steel sheets  increases  monotonically  as  the  strain  rate  increases.  Similar  type  of  result  is  also  observed  by  Peixinho et al. [36] who conducted tensile test with different strain rates on DP600 and TRIP600  steel grades and reported that the DP steel exhibits better strain  hardening properties where the  UTS  has  a  slightly  increased  response  relative  to  its  yield  strength  on  increasing  strain  rate.  Tensile properties of these kinds of steels were observed to be mainly dependent on the volume  fraction [37, 38], strength [39], morphology [40,41] of martensite.  However,  in  the  case  of  welded  dual  phase  steel  Kang  et  al.  [11]  showed  that  welded  DP600  steel  showed  higher  yield  strength  and  also  higher  ultimate  tensile  strength  compare  to
12 

the  base  metal.  But  they  reported  that  the  elongation  of  the  welded  sample  get  reduced  after  welding and in all cases the sample failed in the base metal which actually leads to a conclusion  that the  effect  of  soft  zone  was  not  evident  in  their  study.  Similar  type  of  failure  trend  is  also  observed  by  Uchihara  &  Fukui  [34]  but  in  their  case  the  tensile  strength  got  reduced  after  welding  compared  to  the  base  metal.  In  the  case  of  higher  strength  grades  of  DP  steel  Sreenivasan et al. [12] conducted the tensile tests of laser welded DP980 steel and observed that  both the yield strength and UTS decreased after welding and the fracture always occurred in the  outer HAZ in the soft zone. Similar result was also reported by Xia et al. [15] for DP980 welded  joints  which  actually  indicates  that  the  effect  of  soft  zone  is  more  dominant  on  the  higher  strength grades of DP steel.  Xia et al. [13,15] did the formability test of laser welded DP980 joints and concluded that  in case of the welded blanks the HAZ softened zone in DP980 weldments completely dominated  the fracture pattern. This zone is the vulnerable region in which the failure always initiated. They  also observed that the formability result or limiting dome height of the welded sample is lower  than  the  base  metal.  In  Figure  2.4  the  comparison  between  the  limiting  dome  heights  of  laser  welded DP980 joints and their respective base metal is given.  Sreenivasan  et  al.  [12,14]  conducted  detailed  research  on  the  formability  of  different  grades  of  laser  welded  AHSS  including  DP  steel.  The  major  finding  in  their  study  was  the  formability ratio of laser welded dual phase sheet steels generally decreased with increasing base  metal  strength.  Reduction  in  welded  blank  formability  is  related  to  HAZ  softening  and  formability  ratio  decreased  with  increasing  softening  response.  Panda  et  al.  [42]  also  observed  that the formability of welded DP steel decreased after welding and they believed that the reason  behind this was the localized strain accumulated at the soft zone in HAZ.

Unlike tensile tests and formability tests very limited work related to fatigue properties of  laser welded DP steel joints has been reported. Hadianfard [43] conducted low cycle fatigue test  of  dual  phase  steel  and  found  that  all  specimens  tested  at  different  strain  amplitudes  showed  hardening  for  most  of  the  fatigue  life  with  higher  rates  of  hardening  at  the  first  few  cycles  followed by hardening of gradual decreasing trend.  Galtier  &  Duchet  [44]  studied  the  fatigue  property  of  different  kind  of  joints  made  of  AHSS.  They  found  that  laser  butt  welding  provided  very  satisfactory  joints  as  the  fatigue  property of the joints were as same as that of the base metal. They also concluded that the joints  made  by  laser  welding  was  better  than  the  joints  made  by  other  joining  methods  such  as  resistance  spot  welding  (RSW)  in  terms  of  fatigue  property.  In  terms  of  tensile  fatigue  tests  Uchihara & Fukui [34] reported that the fatigue strength of base metal and laser welded tailored  blanks  of  advanced  AHSS  increased  with  the  increasing  tensile  strength.  They  also  concluded  that  the  fatigue  property  of  laser  welded  joints  was  comparatively  better  than  that  of  other  welding such as mash seam welding.

2.4 

Some unresolved questions and objectives 

A  lot  of  investigations  have  been  directed  towards  the  mechanical  properties  and  work  hardening  behavior  of  DP  steels  in  relation  to  their  microstructure.  Some  empirical  laws  of  stress­strain relationships have been proposed to describe the work hardening behavior of these  steels [21,37,4547]. Among these most popular are Hollomon analysis [48] and Crussard­Jaoul  (CJ)  analysis  [4950]  based  on  Ludwik  [51]  and  Swift  [52]  equations,  popularly  known  as  differential  CJ  (DCJ)  [55,54]  and  modified  CJ  (MCJ)  [5556]  techniques,  respectively  [40,46].  But  the  effect  of  laser  welding  on  the  hardening  characteristics  of  such  steels  is  still  limited. A detailed study on the effect of laser welding on the tensile and hardening properties of  DP steels is thus necessary.  Previous studies on laser welded similar DP steel joints [4,13,14,42] indicated that welding  led to formation of a soft zone in the heataffected zone (HAZ) and the tensile properties of the  welded joints were significantly affected by the presence of soft zone. However, the mechanical  properties of dissimilar grades of laser welded DP steel joints have not yet been reported. As an  autobody or body in white (BIW) structure involves steels having different strength levels, it is  necessary  to  ascertain  how  the  laser  welding  changes  the  microstructure  and  affects  the  mechanical properties in the dissimilar DP steel joints. Questions arose on if such a soft zone is  still present, how the soft zone changes and to what extent the soft zone affects the mechanical  properties in the laser welded dissimilar DP steel joints.  Moreover,  it  is  a  matter  of great  concern  on  how  this  soft  zone  manipulates  the  fatigue  properties of laser welded DP steel joints. While a significant amount of work has been reported  on the tensile properties of laser welded DP steel joints [11,13,57], the knowledge on the fatigue
15 

properties of this kind of joints is very limited. As components of structural applications the laser  welded DP steel joints with soft zones might be prone to failure under cyclic loading condition.  Therefore  it  is  necessary  to  evaluate  the  fatigue  resistance  and  fracture  characteristics  of  laser  welded DP steel joints under cyclic loading. 

One  would  then  ask  if  we  can  find  an  effective  way  to  get  rid  of  the  effect  of  the  detrimental  soft  zone  present  after  welding.  A  possible  solution  to  this  problem  would  be  the  application of postweld heat treatment (PWHT) to the welded joints. Previous work elaborating  the effect of PWHT involved tempering of high carbon high strength steel joints [58,59]. In the  case of the laser welded DP steel joints hardening/strengthening of the joints (or the elimination  of the soft zone) is more desirable instead of tempering. However, no such study on the PWHT  aiming at eliminating the soft zone in the laser welded high strength steel joints and improving  the mechanical properties has been reported in the literature. 

Based on the queries discussed in the above sections, the research objectives of this thesis  can be summarized into two major divisions:  a)  To  evaluate  the  microstructural  changes,  tensile  and  fatigue  properties  with  emphasis  on  work  hardening  behavior  and  the  fracture  characteristics  of  the  laser  welded  similar  and  dissimilar DP steel joints.  b)  To  conduct  proper  PWHT  on  the  laser  welded  DP  steel  joints  for  the  recovery  of  mechanical  properties  degraded  by  the  welding  through  the  evaluation  of  microstructure,  microhardness profile, tensile properties and fatigue strength.

3.2  Laser welding parameters 

The  laser  welding  was  done  using  a  diode  laser  at  the  Center  of  Advanced  Materials  Joining (CAMJ) in University of Waterloo. The welding parameters used in the present study are  shown in Table 3.2. The Nuvonyx ISL4000L diode laser head was mounted on a Panasonic VR6  robotic  arm (Fig.  3.1). The  beam  had  a  rectangular  shape  with  dimensions  of  12  mm×0.9  mm
17 

with a focal length of 90 mm. Also, due to the power density of the diode laser it was restricted  to conduction mode welding. During welding of DP600 steels, ultrahigh purity argon was used  as a shielding gas at a  flow rate of 16.5  l/min on both surfaces of the  blanks whereas  for  both  DP980  similar  welding  and  DP600/980  dissimilar  welding,  the  flow  rate  was  14.2  l/min.  Welding was conducted at a welding speed of 1 m/min in full penetration bead on a plate mode# .

Sample preparation  The microscopic specimens were cut using the saw cut and then ground on 120 grit silicon 

carbide paper  for removing  nicks. Then the samples were  mounted using Bakelite powder  into  Buehler  Simpliment  2000  automatic  mounting  press  and  hot  mounting  was  used  for  all  the  microscopic samples. The temperature and pressure used for hot mounting were 150 ºC and 4200  psi  respectively  and  water  was  used  for  cooling.  After  finishing  mounting  the  microscopic  samples were ground again on silicon carbide paper of 120 grit followed by 320 grit, 600 grit &  1200 grit. For polishing the  samples  Leco VP160 automatic polishing  machine was used. The  polishing was done on 8 diameter Leco polishing cloth by using diamond paste of 6µ followed  by 3µ and 1µ with diamond extender. The etchant used for the optical microscopy was 4% Nital  and the etching time was 45 seconds.  For  the  tensile  and  fatigue  tests  ASTM  E8M  subsized  specimens  were  used.  The  dimensions of  sub sized test sample are given  in  Figure 3.2. The  samples were  initially cut  by  shear  or  band  saw  cutter  at  parallel  to  the  rolling  direction  (RD)  and  initially  machined  by  a  vertical milling machine. The final machining was done by Mori Seki MV35 CNC machine. The  cutter of the CNC machine was high speed steel with titanium nitride coating having a diameter  of  0.5.  The  machining  parameters  used  for  both  base  metal  and  welded  samples  are  given  in  Table 3.3. After machining the samples, two different grits of silicon carbide paper (320 & 600)  were  used  carefully  to  grind  the  surface  of  the  test  samples  to  remove  machining  marks.  Attention  was  given  in  order  to  avoid  any  additional  fillet  on  the  test  samples  while  grinding.  Finally  the  samples  were  cleaned  with  ethanol  to  remove  oils  and  dirt  adhering  on  them  and  necessary  marks  were  drawn  on  the  samples  to  facilitate  the  alignment  during  mounting  the  samples on the testing machine.

Experimental setup & testing 

3.4.1  Optical microscopy and image analysis 

A light microscope coupled with a Clemex image analysis system shown in Figure 3.3 was  used  in  the  optical  microscopic  observations.  It  is  composed  of  Clemex  software  adapted  to  ASTM and ISO standard, a Nikon optical  microscope (10x eye piece,  five different object  lens  with  the  magnification  of  5x,  10x,  20x,  40x  and  100x),  a  high  resolution  digital  camera  and  a  high performance computer to carry out the detailed investigation. 

Figure 3.3  Image analysis systems. 

3.4.2  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

The  microstructures  of  the  base  metal  and  the  welded  joints  were  also  observed  via  scanning  electron  microscope.  The  fractured  surfaces  were  examined  by  SEM  as  well  and  the  chemical composition in the area of interest was determined by electron dispersive spectroscopy
21 

(EDS), including line scan and high resolution mapping. The JSM6380LV shown in Figure 3.4  is a high performance scanning electron microscope with an embedded energy dispersive XRay  analyzer  which  allows  for  seamless  observations  and  has  a  resolution  of  3.0  nm.  The  customizable graphical user interface (GUI) allows the instrument to be intuitively operated, and 
TM  Smile Shot  software ensures optimum operation settings. Standard automated features include 

auto focus, auto stigmator, auto gun (saturation, bias and alignment), and automatic contrast and  brightness  [60].  The  resolution  of  the  SEM  is  much  higher  than  an  optical  microscope  (OM)  because the electrons accelerated to 10,000 keV have a wavelength of 0.12 Angstrom, while the  visible  light  has  wavelength  from  4000  to  7000  angstroms.  Depending  upon  the  situation  the  equipped  three  detectors  ­  secondary  electron  detector,  backscattered  electron  detector,  energy  dispersive Xray detector were used [60].

3.4.3  Microhardness tests 

Vickers  microhardness  tests  were  performed  on  the  unetched  samples  using  a  Buehler  Micromet5100 microhardness tester (Fig. 3.5). A load of 500 gm and a dwell time of 15 seconds  were used during testing. All the values presented were an average of three series of values taken  on  the  same  specimen.  The  center  point  of  the  fusion  zone  was  determined  by  carefully  observing the weld geometry under microscope and all the indentations were adequately spaced  to avoid any potential effect of strain fields caused by adjacent indentations.

3.4.4  Tensile tests 

Tensile  tests  were  performed  at  room  temperature  using  a  fully  computerized  United  tensile  testing  machine  shown  in  Fig.  3.6.  The  strain  rates  selected  in  the  present  study  were

An extensometer with a gauge length of 25 mm was used to measure the strain during the  tests.  At  least  two  samples  were  tested  at  each  strain  rate.  The  0.2%  offset  yield  strength,  ultimate  tensile  strength  and  elongation  to  failure  and  engineering  stressstrain  curves  were  recorded  and  using  these  data  the  tensile  properties  and  work  hardening  characteristics  were  evaluated.  The  JSM6380LV  scanning  electron  microscope  equipped  with  Oxford  energy  dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) system and 3D fractographic analysis was used to observe  the tensile fracture characteristics.

3.4.5  Fatigue tests 

The fatigue tests were performed using a fully computerized Instron 8801 servohydraulic  testing  system  (Fig.  3.7).  Load  controlled  fatigue  tests  were  performed  at  more  than  6  stress  amplitudes.  At  each  stress  level  2  or  more than  two  samples  were  used.  The  stress  ratio  of  R  (min/max) equal to 0.1, sinusoidal waveform, and a frequency of 50 Hz were selected in all the  tests  which  were  performed  at  room  temperature.  The  fatigue  fracture  surface  was  examined  using SEM/EDS to identify fatigue crack initiation sites and propagation mechanisms.

At the beginninig of the test, the value of the maximum applied load, Pmax, was selected to  be  about  one  third  of  the  tensile  strength.  The  mean  load,  Pmean,  which  was  one  of  the  input  parameters,  can be calculated as follows:

3.4.6  Post weld heat treatment 

Post  weld  heat  treatment  (PWHT)  was  carried  out  at  four  different  temperatures  (750°C,  780°C,  810°C,  and  840°C)  in  an  atmospherecontrolled  furnace  for  15  minutes,  followed  by  water  quenching.  The  heat  treatment  procedure  is  shown  Fig.  3.8,  which  is  similar  to  the  intercritical  annealing  followed  by  rapid  cooling  used  to  produce  the  DP  steels  [21,22].  To  ensure  the  accuracy  of  heat  treatment  temperatures,  the  furnace  was  calibrated  using  K  type  thermocouple  prior  to the  PWHT.  To  maintain  an  oxygenfree  environment  inside  the  furnace  chamber, disassociated NH3  and natural gas were supplied at a flow rate of 12 CFH (cubic feet  per hour) and 1 CFH, respectively.

Chapter 4  Results and Discussion 

This  chapter  presents  the  results  and  relevant  discussion  on  the  microstructure  and  mechanical properties of laser welded DP600 joints, DP980 joints and DP600/DP980 dissimilar  joints.  The  mechanical properties  were  evaluated  by  means  of  microhardness  tests,  tensile  and  fatigue  tests,  including  the  fracture  characteristics  and  mechanisms  of  the  joints  under  both  monotonic  and  tensile  loading.  The  last  part  of  this  chapter  depicts  the  results  on  the  effect  of  heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of DP980 welded joints aimed at  eliminating the soft zone. 

4.1  Mechanical properties of laser welded similar DP steel joints  4.1.1  Microstructural evolution 

The  SEM  micrographs  shown  in  Fig.  4.1  represent  the  microstrauctural  evolution  that  occurred during the welding process. The  microstructure of the  DP600  base  metal  can  be seen  from Fig. 4.1(a) which contained martensite islands in the ferrite matrix. The SEM examination  of  fusion  zone  (FZ)  of  the  laser  welded  DP600  indicated  that  the  microstructure  in  this  zone  consisted  of  predominantly  martensite  in  conjunction  with  some  sideplate  ferrite  and  bainite  (Fig. 4.1(b)). The formation of martensite in the FZ resulted from the rapid cooling of the weld  pool during laser welding process. The HAZ of the welded joints contained tempered martensite  and possibly bainite in the ferrite matrix which can be seen from Fig. 4.1(c).

Like the DP600 base metal, the micrograph of DP980 base metal can be characterized by  martensitic  islands  in the  ferrite  matrix (Fig. 4.1(d)) but the  volume  fraction of  martensite was  more compared to DP600.  The  image analysis  indicated that DP600 steel  had a  martensitic  volume  fraction of 25%  while  DP980  steel  had  a  martensitic  volume  fraction  of  52%.  Predominantly  martensitic  phase  along  with  bainite  and  ferrite  sideplates  were  found  to  be  the  microconstituents  in  the  fusion  zone  of  DP980  welded  joints  which  is  shown  in  Fig.  4.1(e). The  HAZ  of  these  kinds  of  joints  contains tempered martensite along with some possibly bainites in the ferrite matrix (Fig. 4.1(f)). 

4.1.2  Microhardness profile 

The micro indentation hardness profiles of laser welded DP600 and DP980 steel joints are  shown  in  Fig.  4.2(a)  and  Fig.  4.2(b),  respectively.  Significantly  higher  hardness  values,  approximately  1.5  times  higher  than  that  in  the  base  metal  were  observed  in  the  case  of  the  welded  DP600  joint  (Fig.  4.2(a))  due  to  the  formation  of  mostly  martensitic  structure  (Fig.  4.1(a)). In the case of welded DP980 steel the hardness value in the FZ was seen to be slightly  higher than that in the base metal.  As  seen  in  Fig.  4.2,  a  slight  decrease  (DP600)  and  a  strong  decrease  (DP980)  in  the  hardness  were  present  in  the  HAZ,  which  were  called  the  soft  zone.  The  presence  of  the  soft  zone  was  mainly  due  to  partial  disappearance  and  tempering  of  preexisting  martensite  [4,13,15,61] which  could  be  seen  in  Fig.  4.1(c). The  degree  of  softening  in  the  welded  DP980  joints was more severe and also the size of the soft zone was larger than the DP600 steel joints.  This is due to the disappearance and tempering of more martensite existing in the DP980 steel.

4.1.3  Tensile properties of laser welded similar DP steel joints 

Fig. 4.3 shows the engineering stressstrain curves obtained from both the base metals and  their  respective  welded  joints.  Both  of  the  base  metals  DP600  and  DP980  showed  basically  smooth and continuous stressstrain curves which could be seen from Fig. 4.3(a) and Fig. 4.3(c).  However, the DP600 welded joints exhibited an obvious yield point phenomenon at all the strain  rates (Fig. 4.3(b)), while the smooth and continuous plastic flow remained in the DP980 welded  joints (Fig. 4.3(d)).

32 

The presence of yield point phenomena in the welded samples was likely due to interstitial  diffusion  which  might occur  during  the  laser  welding  process.  The  high  temperature  generated  from  laser  was  high  enough  to  drive  the  carbon  or  nitrogen  atoms  in  iron  to  diffuse  to  the  position of  high energy  just below the extra plane of atoms  in a positive  edge dislocation. The  strong elastic interaction alleviated the impurity atmosphere to become completely saturated and  condense  into  a  row  of  atoms  along  the  core  of  the  dislocation.  When  such  a  sample  with  dislocations pinned  by  interstitials (i.e., the welded samples  in this study) was  loaded, a  higher  stress  was  required  to  start  the  dislocation  movement  representing  the  onset  of  plastic  deformation.  Once  the  dislocation  line  was  pulled  free  from  the  influence  of  the  solute  atoms,  slip occurred at a lower stress exhibiting yield point phenomena as seen in Fig. 4.3(b) [6264]. 

4.1.3.1  Effect of welding on the tensile properties 

The  effect  of  laser  welding  on  the  yield  strength  of  the  material  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  4.4(a). DP600 welded joints were observed to have higher yield strength than the base metal due  to the presence of yield point phenomena, whereas DP980 welded joints had lower yield strength  compared to the DP980 base metal. The absence of yield point phenomena and the presence of  more tempered martensite in the HAZ, in conjunction with the partial disappearance of existing  martensite  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  the  yield  strength  of  DP980  welded  joints.  The  ultimate  tensile strength (UTS) of DP600 welded  joints was observed to be only  marginally  lower than  that  of  the  base  metal,  whereas  the  welding  led  to  a  significant  reduction  in  the  UTS  in  the  DP980 welded joints (Fig. 4.4(b)). The tensile strength of steel is usually related to its hardness.  As the degree of softening was very small in the DP600 welded joints (Fig. 4.2(a)), the reduction  of  the  UTS  was  also  hardly  visible,  but  in  the  case  of  DP980  welded  joints  the  degree  of
33 

softening  in  the  HAZ  was  significant  (about  130  VHN)  which  eventually  resulted  in  a  lower  tensile strength in the DP980 welded joints. The strength obtained for both the welded joints in  this study was in good agreement with that reported in the literature [11,15,31] (Fig. 4.4 (b)), in  spite of some differences in the welding parameters in different publications.  In  all  the  cases  both  the  YS  and  UTS  showed  only  weak  strain  rate  sensitivity  with  the  strength increasing by a very small amount with increasing strain rate. At higher strain rates the  dislocation movement was delayed which resulted in an increased YS and UTS. Similar kind of  increasing trend with increasing strain rate was also reported by Huh et al. [35] and Samuel [46]  for DP steels. From Fig. 4.4(c) it can be seen that the DP600 base metal was much more ductile  than  the  DP980  base  metal.  This  was  due  to  the  increased  martensitic  volume  fraction  in  the  DP980  steel  compared  to  DP600  steel,  as  mentioned  above.  Welding  led  to  a  reduction  in  the  elongation of both steels, as seen in Fig. 4.4(c). 

4.1.3.2  Work hardening behavior of laser welded similar DP steel joints 

Fig. 4.5 shows a Kocks­Mecking type plot [65] of strain hardening rate  (= d/de ) vs. net 
2  1  flow  stress  (    y)  at  a  strain  rate  of  1×10  s  .  Initially  DP600  base  metal  and  welded  joints 

showed a similar sort of trend  stage III hardening (Fig. 4.5(a)), i.e.,  decreased almost linearly  with increasing net flow stress. When the net flow stress exceeded about 240 MPa the base metal  of  DP600  steel  showed  stage  IV  work  hardening  behavior  despite  the  small  change  of  the    value,  but  it  was  absent  in  the  DP600  welded  joints.  Unlike  DP600  base  metal,  DP980  base  metal showed  a  clear  stage  II  work  hardening  by  maintaining  almost  constant  work  hardening  rate up to a net flow stress of about 120 MPa (Fig. 4.5(b)). Then a linear decraese with increasing

35 

net flow stress (i.e., stage III hardening) occurred until the onset of stage IV hardening at a net  flow stress of approximately 260 MPa. The occurrence of stage IV hardening in both DP980 and  DP600 base steels was in agreement with the observation reported in the literature [65], where it  was  reported  that  stage  IV  hardening  typically  appeared  in  two  phase  alloys.  Again,  like  the  DP600 welded joints, only stage III hardening occurred in the DP980 welded joints Fig. 4.5(b).  The  three  stages  of  work  hardening  behavior  could  be  understood  as  follows:  In  stage  II  the  constant  work  hardening  rate  was  due  to  the  deformation  of  constrained  ferrite  with  possible  transformation  of  retained  autenite  to  martensite  [21,37,40].  The  linear  decrease  of  work  hardening  rate  in  stage  III  arose  from  simultaneous  deformation  of  ferrite  and  martensite  with  attendant  crossslip  of  dislocations  and  dynamic  recovery  of  ferrite  [21,37,40].  In  stage  IV the  low  work  hardening  rate  originated  from  increased  dislocation  mobility  via  profuse  crossslip  [66].  After  yielding  the  stressstrain  relationship  in  the  uniform  deformation  stage  could  be  expressed by Hollomon equation [48], 
s =  K e n  , 

(4.1) 

where    is  the  true  stress, e  is  the  true  strain,  n  is  the  strain  hardening  exponent  and  K  is  the  strength  coefficient.  The  evaluated  n  values  following  Eqn.  4.1  as  a  function  of  strain  rate  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.6(a)  .  It  is  seen  that  DP600  base  metal  possesed  a  higher  work  hardening  exponent than the DP980 base metal. The stronger deformation ability in the DP600 base metal  was  attributed  to  the  presence  of  a  larger  amount  of  deformable  ferrite  in  the  material.  With  increasing  volume  farction  of  martensite  in  a  dualphase  steel  the  value  of n  usually  decreases  [21].

base metal and welded joint and (b) DP980 base metal and welded joint. 

After  welding,  the  DP600  welded  joints  showed  a  lower  work  hardening  exponent  compared  to  the  DP600  base  metal.  However,  the  DP980  welded  joints  had  a  slightly  higher  value of n than the DP980  base  metal. This  might be related to the appreciable softness  in the 
37 

HAZ (Fig.4.2(b)), which would give rise to a higher dislocation  storage or hardening capacity.  The higher the value of n, the higher the material could be deformed before instability [62]. This  could  be  seen  in  Fig.  4.4(c)  and  Fig.  4.6(a),  where  a  higher  n  value  corresponded  to  a  better  ductility  in  the  DP600  steel.  In  all  cases  the  value  of  n  showed  only  a  weak  strain  rate  dependence, i.e., it increased slightly with increasing strain rate.  To  qualify  better  the  strain  hardening  response,  the  differential  CrussardJaoul  analysis  [49,50] of  the  work  hardening  exponent  was  used,  which  was  based  on  the  following  Ludwik  relation [51], 
n  1  s = s y  + K1e  

, 

(4.2) 

where y  is the yield stress, n1  is the strain hardening exponent and K1  is the strength coefficient  which  reperesents  the  increment  in  strength  due  to  strain  hardening  at e  =1.  The  evaluation  of  strain hardening exponent based upon this equation excludes the yield strength. Fig. 4.6(b) shows  the strain  hardening exponent  n1  versus the  strain rate for both the base  metals and the welded  joints. Due to the exclusion of the yield stress in this analysis the work hardening exponents of  both the welded joints were seen to become higher than those of the respective base metals.  In  the  present  study  the  work  hardening  exponent  was  also  evaluated  according  to  the  following equation proposed by Afrin et al. [67], 
* 

s - s y  = K * (  e - e y  ) n 

, 

(4.3) 

*  where n  , , e, y  and ey  are the strain hardening exponent, true stress, true strain, yield strength,  *  and  yield  strain  of  a  material,  respectively.  K  is  the  strength  coefficient  which  reflects  the 

increment in strength due to strain hardening corresponding to (e  ey)=1.

Equ.  (4.3)  represented  the  exclusion  of  both  yield  stress  and  yield  strain.  That  is,  this  relationship  reflected  a  relationship  between  net  flow  stress  vs.  plastic  strain  in  the  plastic 
39 

deformation in which the elastic deformation stage was no longer  included  in the evaluation of 
*  the strain  hardening exponent  [67]. The strain  hardening expoent  n  evaluated  in terms of Equ. 

(4.3)  is  shown  in  Fig.  4.6(c).  It  is  seen  that  in  all  cases  the  values  of  the  work  hardening  exponents were observed to increase with increasing strain rate to a certain extent . Higher strain  rates  would  lead  to  a  stronger  restriction  to the  dislocation  motion  which  in  turn  increased  the  work hardening of a material, since the higher strain rate was observed to generate a dislocation  morphology  with  a  greater  number  of  tangles  in  the  cell  walls  and  the  more  refined  cell  size  contributed to stronger work hardening [68]. 

4.1.3.3  Tensile failure location and fractography 

All the welded samples failed in the HAZ with an example shown in Fig. 4.7 for a welded  DP600  tensile  sample.  Careful  observation  during  the  tensile  tests  showed  that  the  onset  of  yielding  occurred  in  the  softened  zone  and  then  the  majority  of  the  plastic  deformation  was  accumulated in that zone (i.e., in the HAZ) until final failure.

40 

The fracture surface characteristics were basically similar in both the base metals and their  welded  joints.  Ductile  type  of failure  mode  was  represented  by  cuplike  dimple  rupture  which  was the main feature of the fracture surface. Typical SEM micrographs of the fracture surface of  the  welded  samples  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.8,  where  the  center  and  the  edge  of  DP600  welded  samples were shown in Fig. 4.8(a) and Fig. 4.8(b) and the similar location of the fracture surface  of DP980 welded samples were illustrated in Fig. 4.8(c) and Fig. 4.8(d), respectively.

The  fracture  surface  at  the  center  (Fig.  4.8(a)  &  4.8(c))  contained  basically  equiaxed  dimples  indicating  typical  ductile  fracture  caused  by  simple  tensile  loading.  However,  careful  observations  of  these  two  SEM  images  indicated  that  the  size  of  the  dimples  on  the  fracture  surface of the DP600 welded joints (Fig. 4.8(a)) was larger than that of the DP980 welded joints  (Fig. 4.8(c)). This was due to the fact that the DP600 welded joints contained more deformable  ferrite and exhibited a larger elongation than the DP980 welded joints (Fig. 4.4(c)). The fracture  surface  near  the  edge  (Fig.  4.8(b)  and  (d))  showed  a  combination  of  both  equiaxed  and  shear  dimples as it had a network of dimpled impressions of equiaxed appearance along with dimples 
42 

having an elongated parabolic shape indicating the occurrence of shearing motion in conjunction  with the simple tensile load. The fracture surface of the welded joints was observed to have some  deeper dimples. Energy dispersive Xray spectroscopic point  analysis  indicated the presence of  manganesecontaining  particles  residing  in  the  deep  dimples,  as  shown  in  Fig.  4.9.  While  the  DP980  steel  had  less  manganese  content  than  the  DP600  steel  (Table  3.1),  the  higher  carbon  content  would  promote  to  generate  more  carbide  during  welding  [69],  which  might  also  be  another factor contributing to the lower elongation of the DP980 welded joints (Fig. 4.4(c)). 

4.1.4  Fatigue behavior of laser welded similar DP steel joints 

4.1.4.1  Fatigue properties 

The  SN  curves  obtained  from  the  load  control  fatigue  tests  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.10.  The  DP600 welded joints were found to have a slightly lower fatigue limit than that of the base metal.  Indeed the DP600 base metal and the welded joints showed almost the same fatigue life within  the experimental scatter at higher stress amplitudes.  This indicated that for the DP600 welded joints the slight drop in the hardness (Fig. 4.2(a))  in the HAZ was not large enough to reduce the fatigue strength at higher stress amplitudes, and  thus the effect of laser welding on the fatigue resistance of DP600 steel could be negligible. On  the other hand, DP980 welded  joints showed a  lower fatigue  life than the DP980 base  metal at  both higher and lower stress amplitude levels. This corresponded well to the effect of the severe  soft  zone  with  a  significant  reduction  in  the  hardness  (Fig.  4.2(b)).  Due  to  this  significant  softening in the HAZ the DP980 welded joints showed a considerably (~100 MPa) lower fatigue  limit than the DP980 base metal.
43 

Figure 4.10

DP980 steels tested at R = 0.1, 50 Hz and room  temperature where the data points with arrow  marks indicate the runout samples. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  softening  in  the  DP980  welded  joints  was  so  severe  that  the  lowest hardness in the soft zone was even slightly lower than that of DP600 welded joints (Fig.  4.2(a) and (b)), which also resembled to the findings from the fatigue tests (Fig. 4.10) where the  DP980  welded  joints  showed  even  a  fatigue  limit  lower than  that of  the  DP600  welded  joints.  However, even though the negative effect of the soft zone on the fatigue resistance of the DP980  welded joints in comparison with the DP980 base metal was large, the fatigue life of the DP980  welded  joints  was  basically  longer  than  that of  both the  DP600  welded  joints  and  DP600  base  metal at the higher stress amplitudes (Fig. 4.10).

44 

The obtained fatigue limit and fatigue ratio are tabulated in Table 4.1. The fatigue limit of  the  DP600  welded  joints  was  12.5%  lower  than  that  of  the  base  metal,  whereas  the  DP980  welded  joints  showed  a  40%  reduction  in  the  fatigue  limit  compared  to  the  base  metal.  The  fatigue ratio of the DP600 welded joints and DP980 welded joints was obtained to be 0.28 and  0.21, respectively. All these results suggested that although the presence of the severe soft zone  in the DP980 welded joints showed a detrimental effect, the mild soft zone present in the DP600  welded joints only exhibited a minor effect on the fatigue strength after laser welding.

4.1.4.2  Fatigue failure location and mechanism 

In all cases of fatigue tests the DP980 welded joints failed in the soft zone/HAZ, regardless  of the stress amplitudes applied. Unlike the DP980 welded joints, the DP600 welded joints failed  in the HAZ at the stress amplitudes above 250 MPa, but failed far away from the weld centerline  or FZ at the stress amplitudes below 250 MPa. These results corresponded to the presence of an  inflection  point  on  the  SN  curves  at  a  stress  amplitude  of  about  250  MPa  in  both  the  DP600  welded joint and respective base metal, as shown in Fig.4.10. The failure location of the welded  samples tested at two different ranges of stress amplitudes can be seen in Fig. 4.11. The possible  reason  for  this  effect  would  be  related  to  cyclic  strengthening  mechanisms  involving  deformationinduced martensite transformation [7075].

46 

Figure 4.11 

Typical fatigue failure location of the DP600 welded samples tested at a stress 

amplitude of (a) above 250 MPa, and (b) below 250 MPa. 

The DP steel contained a small amount of retained austenite  in  its  microstructure during  cyclic loading the retained austenite transformed to martensite and gave additional strengthening  effect in the steel. These martensitic particles were considered to further pin the dislocations and  dominate  the  cyclic  deformation  [76].  In  the  LCF  region  where  the  samples  were  tested  at  a  higher  stress  amplitude  the  dislocations  could  overcome  the  martensite  barriers  as  the  applied  stress magnitude surpassed the pinning force created by martensite, resulting in more cumulative  damage in the gauge section of the test samples. This phenomenon would be the reason why at
47 

the higher level of stress amplitudes the failure occurred in the gauge section for both base metal  and welded joints. More specifically for the welded samples fatigue failure occurred at the outer  HAZ due to the lower hardness (Fig 4.2(a)). But in the HCF region where the sample lasted for a  longer period of time at a lower level of stress amplitudes, the applied stress could not overcome  the  pinning  force  created  by  the  martensite  interacting  with  the  dislocations.  The  area  near  the  end of the gauge section became the weakest area due to potential stress concentration caused by  the notch effect. Generally, the  notch effect was reported to be stronger in the  longerlife HCF  region  compared  to the  shorterlife  LCF  region [77]. In  contrast,  in  the  case  of  DP980  welded  joints  the  hardness  reduction  in  the  HAZ  was  so  severe  compared  with  the  base  metal  (Fig.  4.2(b)) that the role of the deformation induced martensitic transformation would be masked. As  a result, the soft zone in the HAZ directly represented the location of fatigue failure at all stress  amplitudes for DP980 welded joints. 

4.1.4.3  Fractographic analysis of fatigue fracture 

The  fractographic  examinations  of  the  fracture  surfaces  revealed  that  fatigue  crack  initiation  occurred  from  the  specimen  surface  (Fig.  4.12(a)  and  (b)).  If  there  was  no  severe  defects existent inside the material, fatigue crack initiation normally occurred from the specimen  surface since the surface was usually less constrained than the interior grains [78]. The back and  forth  fine  slip  movement  during  cyclic  loading  built  up  notches  or  ridges  at  the  surface  (i.e.,  extrusions  and  intrusions)  [64].  These  kinds  of  notches  with  a  notch  root of  atomic  dimension  could act as a stress raiser and might act as the nucleation site of the fatigue crack. The fatigue  crack could also result from the surface roughness.

The samples tested at lower stress amplitudes showed the crack initiation from the surface  along with a  larger crack propagation area on the fracture surfaces. The crack propagation was  mainly  characterized  by  typical  fatigue  striations  in  conjunction  with  secondary  cracks  (Fig.  4.12(c)).  These  striations,  usually  perpendicular  to  the  propagation  direction,  occurred  by  a  repeated plastic bluntingsharpening process due to the slip of dislocations in the plastic zone at  the  fatigue  crack  tip  [64,79].  The  spacing  between  these  striations  was  smaller  near  the  crack  initiation site and became larger with increasing distance from the crack initiation site since the 
49 

striation spacing was associated with fatigue crack propagation rate. The faster crack propagation  at the center of the left part of fracture surface in Fig. 4.12(a) was characterized by characteristic  dimple  rupture  (Fig.  4.12(d)),  representing  typical  ductile  type  of  fracture  mode.  The  slightly  elongated oval shaped dimples due to shear motion were the primary feature near the edge of the  fracture surface representing final rapid failure of the sample. 

Both  the  base  metal  and  their  respective  welded  samples  had  basically  similar  fracture  surface  characteristics.  However,  the  DP600  base  metals  and  their  welded  joints  tested  at  or  below a  stress amplitude of 250 MPa  showed  some deformation  bands  situated away  from the  crack initiation site shown in Fig. 4.13(a) and (b). The formation of the deformation bands was  mainly  due  to  the  inhomogeneous  deformation,  caused  by  the  presence  of  crystallographic  texture  in  the  rolled  plate  [80,81].  Further  studies  on  the  effect  of  texture  on  fatigue  fracture  mechanisms in the welded DP600 steel joints are needed.

4.2  Mechanical properties of laser welded dissimilar DP Steel joints 

4.2.1  Microstructural evolution 

Fig. 4.14 shows SEM micrographs representing the typical microstructural changes during  the laser welding process. As seen from Fig. 4.14(a) the microstructure of DP600 base metal was  characterized by martensite islands in the ferrite matrix. The HAZ microstructure at the DP600  side is shown in Fig. 4.14(b), consisting of tempered martensite and possibly bainite along with  some  preexisting  martensite  in  the  ferrite  matrix.  The  fusion  zone  (FZ)  of  this  kind  of  welded  joints  contained  mainly  martensite  along  with  sideplate  ferrite  as  seen  from  Fig.  4.14(c).  The  formation of martensite in the FZ was a result of the rapid cooling of the weld pool containing  mixed  DP600  and  DP980  steels  during  the  welding.  At  the  other  side  of  the  FZ,  the  HAZ  of  DP980  steel  showed  the  presence  of  tempered  martensite  along  with  some  possible  bainite  in  conjunction  with  some  preexisting  martensite  in  the  ferrite  matrix  (Fig.  4.14(d)).  Like  DP600  steel,  the  DP980  base  metal  also  contained  martensite  in  the  ferrite  matrix,  but  with  a  higher  martensitic volume fraction (Fig. 4.14(e)). 

4.2.2  Microhardness profile 

The  microhardness  profile  of  the  laser  welded  dissimilar  joint  is  shown  in  Fig.  4.15,  corresponding directly to the  microstructural change  in  Fig. 4.14. Significantly  higher hardness  in  the  FZ  than  that  in  both  base  metals  was  observed  due  to  the  formation  of  prevailing  martensite (Fig. 4.14(c)).

52 

In the HAZ there existed a significant hardness drop called "soft zone" as indicated in Fig.  4.15,  in  comparison  with  both  the  FZ  and  BM  regions.  The  occurrence  of  the  soft  zone  was  partly attributed to the disappearance of martensite and partly due to tempering of the remaining  martensite preexisting  in the base metals during laser welding. Similar observations have been  reported in [4,13,15,61]. It is of interest to observe that the degree of softening was more severe  and the size of the soft zone was  larger at the DP980 side than at the DP600 side, exhibiting a  characteristic  asymmetrical  hardness  profile  across  the  dissimilar  joint  (Fig.  4.15).  This  was  attributed to the  vanishing and tempering of  more preexisting  martensite at the DP980 side. It  should  be  noted  that  although  the  degree  of  softening  was  more  acute  at  the  DP980  side,  the  lowest hardness value across the entire dissimilar joint was still positioned in the HAZ of DP600  side.  The  hardness  in  the  base  metals  was  nearly  constant,  and  as  expected  DP980  base  metal  exhibited  a  higher  hardness  than  DP600  base  metal  due  to  its  higher  volume  fraction  of  martensite. 

4.2.3  Tensile properties of laser welded dissimilar DP steel joints 

Fig.  4.16(a)  shows  typical  engineering  stressstrain  curves  for  both  base  metals  and  laser 
2  1  welded dissimilar DP joint tested at a strain rate of 1×10  s  . Although both base metals showed 

smooth and continuous stressstrain characteristics, the dissimilar welded joint exhibited a yield  pointlike phenomenon which could be better seen from the insert of Fig. 4.16(a). The presence  of  yieldpoint  phenomena  in  the  welded  samples  was  likely  due  to  interstitial diffusion  which  might occur during laser welding process [61,62,64].

4.2.3.1  Effect of welding on the tensile properties 

While  the  yieldpointlike  phenomenon  of  the  dissimilar  welded  joints  was  not  so  strong  (Fig.  4.16(a)),  the  YS  of  the  dissimilar  welded  joints  were  apparently  higher  than  that  of  the  DP600 base metal, as shown in Fig. 4.16(b). However, it was lower than the YS of DP980 base  metal. The UTS of the dissimilar welded joints was observed to be essentially the same as that of  the DP600 base metal. It is known that the UTS of steel is proportional to its hardness value.

55 

While the welded  joints showed softening at both sides of  FZ, the degree of  softening  at  the DP600 side was  very small or  insignificant (Fig. 4.15). Thus the UTS of the welded  joints  were almost identical to that of the DP600 base metal. In all cases both YS and UTS exhibited 
5  2  1  only a  very weak strain rate dependence  in the range  between 1×10  and 1×10  s  . At higher 

strain rates the dislocation movement might be delayed, resulting in a slightly increased YS and  UTS.  It  was  also  reported  that  the  higher  strain  rate  generated  a  dislocation  morphology  with  more tangles in the cell walls and more refined cell size which in turn increased the strength [68].  Besides, it is seen from Fig. 4.16(a) that despite the higher YS and the same UTS, the dissimilar  welded joint showed a lower ductility which was only equivalent to that of DP980 base metal but  lower than that of DP600 base metal. 

4.2.3.2  Work hardening characteristics of dissimilar DP steel joints 

Fig.  4.17  presents  a  KocksMecking  type  plot  [65]  of  work  hardening  rate  vs.  net  flow 
2  1  stress (y) at a strain rate of 1×10  s  . It is seen that the strain hardening rate of the dissimilar 

welded joint basically lay inbetween those of DP600 and DP980 base metals. The welded joint  and  DP600  base  metal  showed  basically  stage  III  work  hardening  behavior  as  indicated  by  a  linear  decrease  of  work  hardening  rate  with  increasing  flow  stress  (Fig.  4.17).  While  the  dissimilar welded joints showed only stage III work hardening behavior, the DP600 base metal  had stage IV work hardening behavior when the net flow stress exceeded ~270 MPa although the  change  of  the  value  of  work  hardening  rate  was  small.  Unlike  the  dissimilar  welded  joint  and  DP600 base metal, the DP980 base metal displayed initially stage II work hardening behavior as  indicated  by  almost  constant  work  hardening  rate  up to  a  net  flow  stress  of  ~90  MPa  (Fig.  4),

56 

followed  by stage III hardening until ~300 MPa,  and  finally stage IV  hardening appeared. The  three stages of work hardening behavior has been already described in the section 4.1.3.2.

After  yielding  the  stressstrain  relationship  in  the  uniform  deformation  stage  may  be  expressed by Hollomon equation [48]. The evaluated n values following Eqn. 4.1 as a function of  strain  rate  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.18.  It  is  seen  that  DP600  steel  possesed  higher  work  hardening  exponent than the DP980 steel, while the n value of the dissimilar welded joints lay inbetween  those of DP600 and DP980 base metals. This corresponded well to the results presented in Fig.  4.16(a). The work hardening exponent was also expected to be influenced by the volume fraction  of  martensite  in  the  material.  With  increasing  volume  farction  of  martensite  the  value  of  n 
57 

usually  decreased  [37].  It  is  believed  that  the  work  hardening  in  the  DP  steels  was  mainly  associated with the amount of ferrite which was relatively soft in comparsion to martensite ­ the  more the ferrite (or the less the volume farction of martensite), the higher the hardening capacity,  since the capacity for the storage of dislocations and their interaction was higher.  In all cases the  values of n showed only a weak strain rate senitivity and incresed with increasing strain rate by a  very small amount.

4.2.3.3  Tensile failure location and fractography 

Regarding the failure location all the dissimilar joints failed in the soft zone at the DP600  side,  corresponding  to  the  minimum  hardness  value  in  the  microhardness  profile  across  the  dissimilar welded joint (Fig. 4.15).  Careful  observations  during  tensile  tests  showed  that  yielding  started  from  the  soft  zone  and the  subsequent plastic deformation accumulated  in this zone until  final  failure. The tensile  fracture surface characteristics were basically similar in both the welded joints and DP600 base  metal.  The  tensile  fracture  surfaces  showed  mostly  equiaxed  dimples  (Fig.  19(a))  at the  center  indicating typical ductile fracture in the DP steels, regardless of the welding. The fracture surface  near the  specimen  surface showed a combination of  both equiaxed and elongated dimples  near  the edge (Fig. 4.19(b)), indicating the occurrence of shearing motion.

4.2.4  Fatigue performance of laser welded Dissimilar DP steel joints  4.2.4.1  Fatigue properties 

Fig. 4.20 depicts the obtained SN curve for DP600/DP980 dissimilar joints. It is seen that  at higher stress amplitudes the fatigue strength of the dissimilar welded joints was basically the  same  as  that  of  DP600  base  metal,  which  was  however  much  lower  than  that  of  DP980  base  metal. This was due to the fact that the DP980 base metal was much stronger as reflected by the  considerably higher hardness (lefthand side in Fig.4.15) and UTS (Fig. 4.16). 

Figure 4.20 

SN curves of the base metals and the dissimilar welded joints tested at R=0.1, 50 

Hz and room temperature where the runout samples were indicated by arrow marks.

60 

The  equivalent  fatigue  life  or  strength  between  the  dissimilar  welded  joints  and  DP600  base metal suggested that the laser welding had little effect on the fatigue performance of DP600  steel at intermediate and higher stress amplitudes in spite of the occurrence of the soft zone. This  could be understood via the result shown in Fig. 4.15, where the minimum hardness in the HAZ  or soft zone at the DP600 side was only marginally lower than that the average hardness value of  DP600 base metal. However, the welded joints showed a lower fatigue limit than the DP600 base  metal  (Fig.  4.20).  This  suggested  that the  slight  reduction  of  the  hardness  in  the  soft  zone  did  have an effect on the fatigue strength at lower stress amplitudes.  The  fatigue  limit  and  the  fatigue  ratio  of  the  materials  tested  in  the  present  study  are  tabulated at Table 4.3. The fatigue limit of the dissimilar welded joints was observed to be lower  than that of the DP600 and DP980 base metals by about 25% and 40%, respectively, whereas the  obtained  fatigue  ratio  of  the  dissimilar  welded  joints  lay  inbetween  the  base  metals  but  was  close to that of DP980 base metal.

The  reduction  of  the  fatigue  limit  indicated  that the  HAZ  softening  of  the  weld  played  a  significant  role  in  the  fatigue  properties  at  lower  stress  amplitudes.  Therefore,  in  the  fatigue
61 

design  and/or  life  prediction  of  the  welded  joints,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the  weakening  effect  of  welding  on  the  fatigue  limit  so  as to  ensure  the  integrity  and  longevity  of  automotive components. 

4.2.4.2  Fatigue failure location 

While all the dissimilar welded joints failed exclusively in the soft zone at the DP600 side  during  tensile  tests,  the  failure  location  of  the  welded  joints  was  observed  to  be  related  to  the  applied stress amplitudes. The samples tested at lower stress amplitudes failed far away from the  middle gauge section but the samples tested at higher stress amplitudes failed at the soft zone in  the HAZ, as shown in Fig. 4.21. 

Figure 4.21 

Fatigue failure locations of the dissimilar welded joints tested at a stress amplitude 

of (a) 275 MPa, (b) 200 MPa.
62 

The possible reason for the occurrence of different failure locations would be explained by  cyclic  strengthening  mechanism  involving  deformationinduced  martensitic  transformation  7375  [7375]. Small amount of retained austenite contained  in the DP steels could  be transformed to  martensite,  giving  rise  to  additional  strengthening  in  the  longer  life  high  cycle  fatigue  (HCF)  region. The newly formed martensite interacted with the dislocations [76] and made it tough at  the relatively lower stress amplitudes to overcome the pinning force created by martensite. Then  the  area  near  the  end  of  gauge  section  became  the  weakest  due  to  the  potential  stress  concentration caused by the notch effect.  Indeed it has been pointed out that the notch effect was usually stronger in the longer life  HCF region compared to the shorter life low cycle fatigue (LCF) region [77]. In the LCF region  where  the  samples  were  tested  at  higher  stress  amplitudes  the  dislocations  could  more  easily  overcome the  martensitic  barriers  as the  magnitude of applied  stress was  high enough to cause  more cumulative damage in the soft zone of the test samples. As a result, the welded dissimilar  DP steels failed in the soft zone of DP600 side at higher stress amplitudes. 

4.2.4.3  Fractographic analysis of fatigue fracture 

The fatigue samples tested at lower and intermediate stress amplitudes showed clearly the  crack initiation site and crack propagation area on the fracture surface. A typical example of the  overall  fracture  surface  of  a  sample  tested  at  225  MPa  is  shown  in  Fig.  4.22(a).  The  crack  initiation took place from the surface (Fig. 4.22(b)). The governing mechanism of fatigue crack  initiation and propagation has been described in section 4.1.4.3 [61,64].

64 

A magnified view of the crack initiation site is shown in Fig. 4.22(c), and the early stage of  crack propagation near the crack initiation site  is in  Fig. 4.22(d), where  fatigue striations could  be  seen  but their  spacing was  very small, reflecting an  initially  slow rate of crack propagation.  With  increasing distance  from the crack  initiation site, the spacing of  fatigue  striations  became  gradually larger representing an increasingly faster propagation, as shown in (Fig. 4.22(e)). The  fatigue  striations  occurred  usually  perpendicular  to  the  propagation  direction.  The  presence  of  secondary  cracks  was  also  evident  in  the  faster  crack  propagation  area,  which  appeared  to  increase  with  increasing  distance  from  the  initiation  site  as  well.  The  formation  of  fatigue  striations  was  basically  considered  to  be  due  to  a  repeated  plastic  bluntingsharpening  process  caused  by  either  dislocation  slip  [79]  or twinning  [82]  in  the  plastic  zone  ahead  of  the  fatigue  crack  tip.  The  final  rapid  crack  propagation  at  the  center  of  the  fracture  surface  was  mainly  characterized  by the cuplike dimples, as  shown  in  Fig. 4.22(f), which was  indeed the  same as  the monotonic tensile fracture surface characteristics (Fig. 4.19(a)).

65 

4.3  Effect of heat treatment on the laser welded DP980 joints 

The extent or severity of the softening was found to be associated with the volume fraction  of preexisting original martensite in the DP steels [4,83] which usually increases with increasing  strength grades of DP steels. For instance, the degree of softening was observed to be much more  severe in the DP980 welded joints than in the DP600 welded joints due to the higher amount of  martensite preexisting in the DP980 base metal [83]. The presence of severe soft zone resulted  in a significant decrease in the tensile strength and fatigue limit compared with the corresponding  base metal [83]. A possible solution to this problem would be the application of postweld heat  treatment  (PWHT)  to  the  welded  DP980  joints  to  eliminate  the  soft  zone  and  improve  the  mechanical properties. The following sections will discuss the results of the effect of PWHT on  the microstructure and mechanical properties of laser welded DP980 joints. 

4.3.1  Effect of heat treatment on the microhardness and microstructure 

Fig.  4.23  shows  the  microindentation  hardness  profile  across  the  laser  welded  DP980  joints and also the effect of heat treatment on the hardness profile of these joints. It is seen that in  the  aswelded  (i.e.,  nonheattreated)  DP980  joint  significantly  higher  hardness  values  was  obtained  in the  FZ corresponding to the  mostly  martensitic  structure (Fig. 4.1(e)). However, in  the  HAZ  the  hardness  became  considerably  lower  than  that  in  the  BM,  with  the  lowest  value  appeared near the FZ. The presence of such a severe soft zone in the DP980 welded joints was  attributed to the occurrence of tempering and vanishing of the preexisting martensite in this area  (Fig. 4.1(f)). Similar observations have also been reported in [4,13,14,61,83].

The hardness profile of the welds changed considerably after heat treatment as seen from  Fig. 4.23. In particular, the hardness values became basically constant throughout different zones  of  the  laser  welded  joints.  The  hardness  increased  clearly  with  increasing  heat  treatment  temperature,  and  the  loss  of  hardness  in  the  soft  zone  caused  by  the  welding  has  been  fully  recovered  to  the  base  metal  hardness  level  of  about  HV310  in  the  temperature  range  between  750°C and 780°C. Therefore the goal of getting rid of the soft zone via the present simple post  weld heat treatment has been achieved.

Effect of heat treatment on the  microhardness profile of the  laser welded DP980 

67 

The change in the hardness shown in Fig.4.23 was directly associated with the evolution in  the  microstructure after heat treatment. Microstructural examinations using SEM  indicated that  the microstructure across the different zones of the laser welded joints after PWHT was basically  homogeneous  and  consistent,  thus  giving  rise  to  the  constant  hardness  values  illustrated  in  Fig.4.23.  Some  typical  SEM  micrographs  showing  the  microstructures  of  the  laser  welded  DP980 steel  joints  after PWHT at different temperatures following the procedure given  in  Fig.  3.8 are shown in Fig. 4.24.

It should be noted that all the micrographs shown in Fig. 4.24 were taken at a distance of  about 3 mm from the weld centerline, i.e., in the original hardness valley area in Fig.4.23. It is  clear that the distribution of martensite was uniform and the amount of martensite increased with  increasing  heat  treatment  temperature.  Quantitative  image  analysis  indicated  that  the  volume  fraction  of  martensite  was  about  0.52  for  the  BM,  and  increased  to  0.60,  0.69,  0.76,  and  0.86  after PWHT at 750°C, 780°C, 810°C and 840°C, respectively. This was due to the fact that more  austenite  was  formed  at  higher  temperatures,  which  subsequently  transformed  into  martensite  upon quenching into water.  The increased hardness with increasing heat treatment temperature  shown in Fig. 4.23 was just a consequence of the increased volume fraction of martensite present  in the laser welded DP980 steel joints after PWHT. 

4.3.2  Effect of heat treatment on the tensile properties 

Based  on  the  microstructural  change  (Fig.  4.24)  and  hardness  profile  (Fig.  4.23)  two  PWHT  conditions  (750°C  and  810°C)  were  selected  to  conduct  tensile  and  fatigue  tests.  Fig.  4.25  shows  the  engineering  stressstrain  curves  obtained  from  the  DP980  base  metal,  DP980  welded  joints,  PWHT  750ºC  joints  and  PWHT  810ºC  joints.  In  all  the  cases  the  test  materials  showed  a  smooth  and  continuous  stressstrain  curve  without  the  presence  of  yieldpoint  phenomenon.  Careful  observations  during  the  tensile  tests  of  aswelded  joints  showed  that  the  onset  of  yielding  occurred  in  the  soft  zone  and  then  the  majority  of  the  plastic  deformation  accumulated  in  that  zone  until  final  failure.  However,  the  tensile  failure  locations  of  PWHT  joints  were  observed  to  be  indefinite,  i.e.,  no  longer  fixed  at  the  original  soft  zone,  due  to the  occurrence  of  homogeneous  ferritemartensite  dualphase  microstructure  and  nearly  horizontal  microhardenss distribution across the weld after PWHT (Figs 4.23 and 4.24).

4  1  with PWHT obtained at a strain rate of 1×10  s  . 

The evaluated tensile properties of the test materials are tabulated in Table 4.4. Welding led to a  significant decrease in both strength and ductility of the DP980 steel mainly due to the softening  in the HAZ of the welded joints. After PWHT at 750ºC the strength increased. The 810ºC PWHT  resulted  in  almost  recovery  of  the  strength  in  comparison  with  the  base  metal.  However,  the  ductility became lower. One of the potential reasons for this was the increasing volume fraction  of  martensite  with  increasing  PWHT  temperature,  as  mentioned  earlier  and  seen  in  Fig.  4.24.  Another significant reason might be hydrogen induced embrittlement caused by dissociated NH3  and  natural  gas  (CH4)  supplied  during  the  heat  treatment  process.  At  high  temperature  the  elevated solubility of  hydrogen atom disassociated  from ammonia allowed  hydrogen to diffuse

70 

into the metal.  When these hydrogen atoms recombined in minuscule voids of the metal matrix  to  form  hydrogen  molecules,  they  created  pressure  from  inside  the  cavity  they  were  in.  This  pressure  might  increase to levels where the PWHT  joints  had reduced ductility up to the point  where  it  cracked  open.  It  has  been  also  reported  that  the  atomic  hydrogen  formed  in  the  dissociation of ammonia penetrates into the steels and embrittles it [84, 85].  Usually steels grade  having  higher  strength  and  lower  alloying  addition  are  susceptible  to  this  kind  of  hydrogen  embrittlement at higher temperature [86].  After  yielding  the  stressstrain  relationship  in  the  uniform  deformation  stage  may  be  expressed by Hollomon equation [48]. The evaluated n values following Hollomon equation are  shown  in  Table  4.4  for  the  tested  materials.  It  is  seen  that  PWHT  810ºC  joints  showed  the  highest  value  of  strain  hardening  exponent  due  to  the  higher  volume  fraction  of  martensite  in  comparison with the PWHT 750ºC joints and base metal.

PWHT 810ºC joints showed basically stage III work hardening behavior as indicated by a linear
71 

decrease of work hardening rate with increasing net flow stress (Fig. 4.26), the DP980 base metal  showed  multistage  work  hardening  behavior.  The  DP980  base  metal  showed  a  clear  stage  II  work  hardening  by  maintaining  almost  constant work hardening  rate  up to  a  net  flow  stress  of  about  120  MPa  followed  by  stage  III  and  then  stage  IV  hardening  when  the  net  flow  stress  exceeded ~290 MPa although the change of the value of work hardening rate was small in stage  IV.

These  three stages of work hardening  behavior  have  been  already  elaborated in  literature  [21,37,53,66] and discussed in earlier sections. While only stage III work hardening were present  in all the cases of welded joints, after PWHT the work hardening rate became clearly higher. In
72 

particular,  the  PWHT  810ºC  joints  exhibited  about twice  the  values  of work  hardening  rate  of  PWHT 750ºC joints due to the strong resistance of more martensite to the motion of dislocations  during plastic deformation. 

4.3.3  Effect of heat treatment on the fatigue properties 

The  SN  curves  obtained  from  the  load  control  fatigue  tests  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.27.  Compared with the base metal, the DP980 welded joints showed considerably lower fatigue life  at all stress amplitudes due to the occurrence of the severe soft zone with a substantial reduction  in hardness (Fig. 4.23). Due to this acute softening in the HAZ the DP980 welded joints showed  a  considerably  (~100  MPa)  lower  fatigue  limit  than  the  DP980  base  metal.  On  the  other  hand  PWHT  810ºC  joints  showed  an  obvious  recovery  of  the  fatigue  limit  from  the  DP980  welded  joints although the fatigue strength at the higher stress amplitudes was still lower than that of the  base  metal.  However,  the  PWHT  750ºC  joints  showed  no  improvement  in  the  fatigue  limit  in  comparison with the welded DP980 joints. The higher martensitic volume fraction in the PWHT  810ºC joints gave an additional strengthening effect and resulted in a  fatigue  limit of ~50 MPa  higher than that of both the DP980 welded joints and PWHT 750ºC joints.  The obtained fatigue limit and fatigue ratio are tabulated in Table 4.5. The fatigue limit of  the DP980 welded joints was 40% lower than that of the base metal whereas the fatigue limit of  the  PWHT  810ºC  joints  was  33%  higher  than  that  of  the  DP980  welded  joints.  However  the  PWHT  810ºC  joints  showed  approximately  the  same  or  slightly  lower  fatigue  ratio  of  0.20  compared to that of the welded  joints which was 0.21, due to the  much  higher ultimate tensile  strength in the PWHT 810ºC joints.

4.3.4  Fractographic analysis 

The tensile  fracture surfaces showed  mostly equiaxed dimples (Fig. 4.28(a)) at the center  indicating  typical  ductile  fracture  in  the  DP  steels,  irrespective  of  the  welding.  The  fracture  surface near the specimen surface showed a combination of both equiaxed and elongated dimples  near the edge (Fig. 4.28(b)), indicating the occurrence of shearing motion. However, the PWHT  750ºC joints showed mostly cleavage type of characteristics in addition to some dimples on the  tensile fracture surface due to the presence of martensite formed during the fast quenching (Fig.  3.8) ) and possible hydrogen induced embrittlement [87]. 

SEM  observations  revealed  that  the  PWHT  810ºC  joints  had  similar  but  more  cleavage  fracture characteristics due to the presence of higher amount of martensite. Similar results were  reported in [88] where the fracture mode under tensile load became more brittle with increasing  volume  fraction  of  martensite  and  martensitic  particle  size  in  a  surfacecarburized  AISI  8620  steel with dual phase core microstructure and in [87] where brittle fracture surface dominated by  cleavage  characteristics  was  identified  in  steel  pipes  in  ammonia  synthesis  plant  caused  by  hydrogen  induced  cracking..  Almost  no  difference  between  the  center  and  edge  of  the  tensile  fracture surface could be identified in the PWHT joints, as seen from Fig. 4.28(c) and 4.28(d). 

Fatigue  crack  was  observed  to  initiate  from  the  specimen  surface  since  the  surface  was  usually  less  constrained  than  the  interior  grains  [78].  The  back  and  forth  fine  slip  movement  during  cyclic  loading  built  up  notches  or  ridges  at  the  surface  (i.e.,  extrusions  and  intrusions)  [64]  having  notch  root  of  atomic  dimension  could  act  as  a  stress  riser  and  might  act  as  the  nucleation site of the fatigue crack.

The fatigue crack could also result from the surface roughness. A typical example showing  the overall view of the fracture surface of the PWHT 810ºC joint tested at a stress amplitude of  250 MPa is shown in Fig. 4.29(a). The crack initiation site and the nearby slower crack growth  area could be seen in Fig. 4.29(b). The faster fatigue crack growth zone at a higher magnification  was seen to be mainly characterized by fatigue striations which were usually perpendicular to the  propagation direction, as seen from Fig. 4.29(c).

The  striation  spacing  was  smaller  near  the  crack  initiation  site  and  became  larger  with  increasing  distance  from  the  crack  initiation  site  since  it  was  associated  with  fatigue  crack  propagation rate. The formation of fatigue striations, basically in the relatively soft ferrite portion  of the DP base metal and welded joints without or with PWHT, was generally considered to be 

77 

attributed to a repeated plastic bluntingsharpening process associated with either the dislocation  slip in fcc and bcc metals [79] or twinning observed recently in hcp metals, e.g., Mg alloys [89  92].  The  final  rapid  crack  propagation  at  the  center  of  the  fracture  surface  was  mainly  characterized by the cleavage fracture being typical of the brittle fracture mode (Fig. 4.29(d)).

Chapter 5  Conclusions and Future Work 

5.1  Conclusions and summaries 

Based on the discussion on the laser welded similar and dissimilar joints of DP600 and DP980  steels, as well as postweld heat treatment (PWHT), the following conclusions could be drawn: 

1.  The laser welding of DP steels resulted in a large amount of martensitic structure in the FZ  due to the rapid cooling during welding, leading to a considerable increase in the hardness.  However, a soft zone in the HAZ was observed due to the partial vanishing and tempering of  the preexisting martensite in the DP steels. The extent of softening and the size of the soft  zone  were  larger  in  the  DP980  welded  joints  than  in  the  DP600  welded  joints.  Due  to the  difference  in the degree of softening, the dissimilar DP600/DP980 welded  joints  showed a  characteristic unsymmetrical hardness profile across the dissimilar welded joint.  2.  While  the  presence  of  the  HAZ  softening  reduced  the  ductility  to  a  certain  extent,  the  ultimate tensile strength remained nearly unchanged after laser welding in the case of DP600  welded  joints.  However,  the  yield  strength  of  the  DP600  welded  joints  was  observed  to  increase after laser welding due to the presence of yield point phenomena.  3.  DP980 welded joints showed lower yield strength and ultimate tensile strength compared to  its  base  metal  due  to  the  significant  reduction  in  the  hardness  in  the  HAZ.  The  ductility  reduced after welding in both DP steels.

79 

4.  The  YS  of  the  dissimilar  welded  joints  were  higher  than  those  of  DP600  base  metal  but  lower  than  those  of  DP980  base  metal.  The  UTS  of  the  dissimilar  welded  joints  was  essentially  the  same  as  that  of  the  DP600  base  metal,  while  its  ductility  was  equivalent to  that of the DP980 base metal.  5.  The strain rate dependence of the tensile properties was observed to be weak, since the yield  strength and ultimate tensile strength only slightly increased with increasing strain rate from 
5  1  2  1  1×10  s  to 1×10  s  in both base metals and their respective welded joints. 

6.  The base metals of DP steels exhibited multistage work hardening, whereas their respective  similar and dissimilar welded joints showed only a singlestage (or stage III) work hardening  where the work hardening rate decreased linearly with increasing net flow stress.  7.  The  work  hardening  exponents  evaluated  for  both  the  base  metals  and  the  welded  joints  increased slightly with increasing strain rate, indicating weak strain rate dependence as well.  8.  Both the similar and dissimilar welded joints tested at different strain rates failed exclusively  in  the  soft  zone  under  monotonic  loading  and  the  fracture  surface  showed  ductile  fracture  characteristics containing mostly dimpled impressions.  9.  As  a  result  of  the  presence  of  a  severe  soft  zone,  the  DP980  welded  joints  showed  a  significant decrease in the fatigue limit compared with the corresponding base metal. On the  other  hand,  the  presence  of  a  mild  soft  zone  in  the  DP600  welded  joints  was  observed  to  have  little  or  only  a  minor  effect  on  the  fatigue  limit  and  fatigue  life  at  higher  stress  amplitudes within the experimental scatter. However, even though the negative effect of the  severe soft zone on the fatigue resistance of the DP980 welded joints was large, the fatigue

80 

life of the DP980 welded  joints was still equivalent to or even  longer than that of both the  DP600 welded joints and DP600 base metal at higher stress amplitudes  10.  The  dissimilar  welded  joints  exhibited  a  lower  fatigue  limit  than  the  base  metals  but  at  higher stress amplitudes, they had almost the same fatigue life as DP600 base metal despite  the presence of the soft zone.  11.  The DP980 welded  joints  failed exclusively  in the soft zone,  irrespective of the applied  stress amplitudes. The DP600 welded  joints  failed  in the soft zone at the stress amplitudes  above 250  MPa  but  failed  in the  base  metal area at the stress amplitudes  below 250  MPa.  This distinct failure location appeared to be associated with deformation induced martensitic  transformation. Like DP600 welded joints, the fatigue fracture location of the dissimilar DP  steel  joints  was  observed  to  be  associated  with  the  stress  amplitude  applied.  While  the  fatigue  failure  occurred  mainly  in  the  soft  zone  at  the  higher  stress  amplitudes,  nearly  no  failure appeared in the soft zone at the lower stress amplitudes.  12.  In all cases, the fatigue fracture was observed to initiate from the specimen surface and the  crack  propagation  was  characterized  by  typical  fatigue  striation  together  with  secondary  cracks.  13.  The postweld  heat treatment (PWHT) was observed to be  able to eliminate the  soft zone,  giving  rise  to  homogeneously  distributed  ferritemartensite  dualphase  microstructure  and  nearly constant hardness profile across the weld.  14.  With  increasing  PWHT  temperature  the  hardness,  yield  strength,  ultimate  tensile  strength,  and  fatigue  limit  all  increased  due  to  the  formation  of  more  martensite.  However,  the

81 

ductility decreased, resulting in more brittle cleavage fracture due to both formation of more  martensites and possible hydrogen induced embrittlement occurred during heat treatment..  15.  While the PWHT sample showed only stage III strain hardening behavior as well, the failure  location after PWHT was observed to no longer concentrate at the location of the previous  soft zone under both tensile and fatigue loading, in spite of a brittle fracture mode. 

5.2  Scope of future work 

Welding  and  joining  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used  secondary  manufacturing  operations  of  materials. The research in this field has been carried out significantly over the past decades. The  material  scenario of today's world  is also different from what  it was 10 or 20 years ago and  in  this changed material scenario, DP steels have been considered as one of the significant additions  due to their unique mechanical properties. A lot of work has been conducted on the weldability  of DP steels  in terms of different welding process and  varying welding parameters. This thesis  work  is  also  another  addition  to  that  systemic  research  which  has  contributed  significantly  to  modern  technology  by  analyzing  the  usability  of  advanced  structural  materials  in  the  transportation industries. Based on this thesis work and the published literature pertaining to the  related kind of work, the following recommendations are proposed as future work, 

1.  This  work  dealt  with  only  one  type  of  optimized  laser  welding  parameters.  It  should  be  interesting to  examine  the detailed effect of different welding parameters on the  mechanical  properties of laser welded DP steel joints.

82 

2.  The steel sheets used in this study had a thickness of 1.2 mm. Studies should be conducted to  investigate the laser weldability of DP steels having different thicknesses.  3.  A  detailed  study related  to  the  microstructural  evolution  in the  HAZ  with  different  welding  parameters and varying amounts of heat input would further facilitate the understanding of the  soft zone formation. 
1  4.  The  fastest  strain  rate  used  in  the  tensile  tests  in  the  present  study  was  0.01  s  .  Detailed 

studies  on  the  dynamic  tensile  properties  of  laser  welded  DP  steel  joints  under  faster  strain  rates would be of great interest.  5.  Only loadcontrolled fatigue tests were performed in this study. Low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests  of these  joints would  be of significance  for the applications of the welded DP steel  joints  in  the automotive industry.  6.  The  fractography  in  this  study  showed  the  presence  of  deformation  bands  on  the  fatigue  fracture  surface  of  DP600  welded  joints  and  their  respective  base  metal  at  lower  stress  amplitudes. Further studies related to texture can be another interesting aspect of future work.  7.  The current study clearly demonstrated that the applied PWHT could be used to eradicate the  severe  soft  zone  and  effectively  enhance  the  yield  strength,  ultimate  tensile  strength  and  fatigue  limit of the DP980 welded  joints. However, the ductility did  not improve or became  even lower leading to more obvious brittle cleavage fracture as observed in the fractographic  analysis of  fracture surface.  Further studies are thus  needed to optimize the PWHT process,  e.g.,  via  identifying  an  optimal  volume  fraction  of  martensite  and/or  conducting  proper  tempering treatment, etc.

83 

8.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  severe  soft  zone  was  mainly  present  in  the  high  strength  DP980 steel after welding. This  might occur in other high strength steels as well then  such  studies on other welded joints of high strength steels would be needed to ensure the structural  integrity and reliability. On the other hand, for the lower strength DP600 steel, while the soft  zone  was  also  observed  after  laser  welding,  its  softening  degree  was  minor  or  negligible  without seriously affecting the mechanical properties. In such cases, the PWHT might not be  necessary.
