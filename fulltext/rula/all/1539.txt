Thesis Abstract
STRUCTURE AND VITAMIN D3-BINDING AFFINITY OF MILK PROTEINS Muhammad Ali Naqvi Master of Science, Molecular Science Department of Chemistry and Biology Ryerson University 2011 Two projects formed the basis of this thesis related to protein-vitamin D3 (VD3) binding mechanisms and efficacy. First, a method to characterize the binding of VD3 to foodrelated macromolecules that may be used for enrichment of milk was devised. Results suggested that sodium caseinate and hydroxylpropyl--cyclodextrin could effectively bind VD3 and may be used as carriers. Secondly, molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the conformation ensemble of the -casein phosphopeptide (-CPP). Radius of gyration, H-bonding, Ramachandran plot, and secondary structure were ascertained, and showed good agreement with simulations of other disordered peptides as well as experimental data of -CPP. Overall, this new binding assay now affords the ability to study interactions between macromolecules and vitamin D3. As well, by performing simulations of a single casein peptide, important data needed to understand the intramolecular interactions and structure of -casein (as well as the casein micelle) have been elucidated.

This degree has been a life-changing experience owing to my family, friends, students, mentors. These individuals helped shape me a scientist I am now, through their questions, encouragement, sound advice, criticism, sometimes knowingly and sometimes not. I understand that this list may fall short, yet I will attempt to mention those who have left the most memorable impressions in my life over the course of this degree. First of all I would like to thank my wife Waufa, my greatest supporter, my best friend, and counsellor, whose smile kept me sane and whose cooking kept me healthy. Secondly, I want to extend my gratitude to my parents, Dr. Hassan Nawab and Jahan Ara Naqvi, who have devoted their life towards raising me and also encouraging me to pursue science. My brothers and sisters who are always make me feel special yet are humble about their own range of talents and my nieces and nephew, Eshal, Eiliya, Zainab, Hussain and Hasnain, whose presence is a constant source of joy. I would also like to thank Professor Dérick Rousseau, to whom I owe many things, amongst those an introduction to Molecular Science. His far-sightedness saw some potential in this humble student, and nurtured it; all the while making sure work did not seem like a chore. I am truly indebted to him for his support over the years I spent under his supervision. Similarly, I would like to thank Dr. Darrick Heyd, whose unmatched command of multidisciplinary wisdom leaves me striving for more knowledge. He has always been able to provide guidance in difficult questions and has asked some tough ones himself to nudge me over towards the answer.

Chapter 1: Introduction to vitamin D3 & milk proteins
1.1 Focus of the thesis
Vitamin D3 (VD3) allows absorption of calcium and phosphate ions in the intestine by promoting production of ion transport proteins1. Although milk is a great source of calcium and phosphate, it is deficient in vitamin D3 (~1.56nM)2, 3. Without vitamin D, the hydroxyapatite ions (Ca2+ and PO43-) are not absorbed at low concentrations4. In response to this, many countries including Canada, mandate vitamin D fortification in milk5. The fate of vitamin D after fortification ­ whether it binds to caseins and to whey proteins or remains bound to the carrier molecule ­ is unclear. This information is important for reliable transfer of vitamin D from fluid milk to popular dairy products such as cheese6-8. Since milk consumption is decreasing, expanding the dietary sources of vitamin D is a public health issue as only 4% of Canadians have adequate levels of vitamin D9. Cheese is a good source of calcium, contains only traces of lactose and has a high demand amongst consumers10. Consumption of cheese has been steadily rising and is projected to continue to rise, owing to its variety (Figure 2.2b)10. A simple solid content calculation can show that in a year, an average Canadian consumes about twice the solids from cheese rather than from milk (circa 12kg vs. 6kg, respectively)10. Given that cheese is more nutritious on a per gram basis and its consumption is increasing, cheese could potentially be the next food to be mandated for fortification. Unfortunately, transfer of VD3 from fortified milk to cheese is unreliable and ranges from 39 - 90% retention6, 7. There are three reasons to explain this variability. First, whey
1

proteins in milk can bind hydrophobic ligands including VD311, 12. So, during cheese pressing when whey is removed, there is a consequent loss of serum whey proteins and any bound VD3. Second, milk fat plays a significant role in retention of VD3 with a very predictable correlation ­ the higher the fat content, the higher the VD3 retention ­ as the two can associate via hydrophobic interactions7. Finally, the current VD3 fortification method in milk uses a microemulsion stabilized by polysorbate 80 (P80). This method is only effective in aqueous solutions, and therefore may be a cause of VD3 loss during cheese making. At present, the most effective method of incorporating VD3 into cheese is to utilize the casein fraction of milk which is also responsible for the structure of cheese13. Although this potential has been shown previously14, it has not been compared to whey proteins, or to P80 which would allow the determination of best fortification practices. This thesis shows that casein can bind to vitamin D3 and if optimized in the future, the technology could potentially facilitate reliable fortification of dairy products. Caseins, which are naturally found in the form of micelles, are known as nature`s nanoparticles as they are designed to deliver calcium phosphate in milk15. As micelles, they can be described as supramolecular protein structures consisting of s1-casein, s2casein, -casein, and -casein at a ratio of 4:1:3.5:1.5 by molarity16. The internal structure of each micelle is maintained by hydrophobic interactions between protein chains and via electrostatic bridging through calcium phosphate15. The micelles maintain colloidal stability in milk serum by the help of -casein, which acts as a polyelectrolyte brush providing intermicellar steric repulsion17. Structurally, caseins are classified as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)18. The location of each casein protein on the spectrum of structural disorder is unknown, but the
2

degree of disorder dictates their function18. In the mammary cell, micelles are initially formed by weak van der Waals interactions while trapped within membrane-bound vesicles19. These vesicles are secreted from the Golgi apparatus and travel to the apical membrane of the mammary cells where they are released into the extracellular matrix19. During this transit, the vesicles pass through the cytoplasm where they encounter high concentration of calcium and phosphate ions20. The intrinsic disorder of such weaklyformed micelles allows fast sequestration and binding of the ions, which leads to the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate nanoclusters18, 21, 22. This prevents ectopic calcification of the mammary glands and allows active transport of the insoluble calcium phosphate salt necessary for skeletal development of neonates23. Disordered proteins are abundant in nature which underscores the need for detailed structure function studies. For caseins, in addition to localization of ligand binding, knowing the structure can lead to an understanding of internal organization of the micelle. However, to date, there is disagreement even with structural studies coming from the same lab using different equipment. This stems from the fact that many structure determination techniques depend on databases of globular proteins for structural assignments. For IDPs, use of these databases skew the final conformation calculation towards folded, globular structures and away from relatively unstable conformations such as the polyproline-II (PPII) helix and extended -strands24. This is the case for circular dichroism and FTIR. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has also been used to characterize structure of disordered proteins, but they have to be small, and manual characterization of chemical shifts is required to determine the structure.

3

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been hailed as the holy grail` of protein structure determination25. IDPs are difficult to study structurally due to conformational heterogeneity and their tendency to aggregate26. Computer simulations, which are not limited by these experimental constraints, provide atomic resolution in studying IDPs. In testing out MD simulations for casein structure determination, it is important to validate the method with experimental results. Thus far, MD has been successful in characterizing the folding pathways of small polypeptides. So to perform MD on casein proteins, one has to start small and validate results with the most well studied casein polypeptide. It has been shown that -casein phosphopeptide (f1-25) (-CPP) is an appropriate structural and functional analog of the peptide chains surrounding the calcium phosphate nanoclusters in the casein micelle27. Qualitative structural changes in the peptide have been observed using NMR upon binding of calcium phosphate ions28. Conventional structural studies of the peptide to date, however, have yielded no agreement on the secondary structure. Hence, -casein phosphopeptide (f1-25) was a good starting point for MD simulations with caseins. As part of this thesis, MD simulation of -CPP accomplished three major goals. First, it allowed validation of the MD simulation method in comparison to experimental results. Second, it helped resolving the secondary structure controversy of -CPP that currently exists in literature. Finally, with further simulations it will assist structure function correlations of the peptide in its biological role as a calcium carrier.

1.2 History of the thesis
This thesis started out with the goal of optimizing the binding interaction of casein micelles with vitamin D3 (VD3). This was to be accomplished by studying their structurefunction relationship (Figure 1.1) and to localize the casein micelle moieties involved with VD3 binding. Experimentally, the interaction can be understood by characterizing thermodynamics of binding. This required that the association constant (Kd) and stoichiometry of binding (n) be measured. As fluorescence had been used extensively in literature, a significant amount of time and effort was initially spent using this technique to study VD3-casein interaction. However, the end results proved

unreliable, due to technical caveats. These included issues with data acquisition (convolution of different mechanisms:

(multiple ways to process data, and issues with equation derivations). After unsuccessful attempts at using fluorescence, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was explored. This method avoids many of the caveats of fluorescence and is considered the gold standard in studying binding interactions. The main requirement of this method is that of an appropriate solvent for both VD3 and casein, so that the response observed is only due to the interaction. Although many solvents and combinations were tested, ultimately, none were suitable for this system. This was because VD3 is hydrophobic whereas caseins are

5

primarily hydrophilic. So, a new binding method was developed to quantify the interaction of VD3 with caseins. At that point, the focus of experiments became the legitimacy of the newly developed assay by testing it with various macromolecules known to bind vitamin D3. On the theoretical side, initial attempts with docking of VD3 on caseins couldn`t be accomplished, because of the lack of structures available for the complete micelle. For docking experiments, the primary prerequisite is to have a high quality structure native to the solvent conditions in which the experiment is to take place. As yet, only one set of in vacuo simulation has been conducted per casein29-31. Simple explicit water simulations revealed that structures were drastically different from in vacuo work done in the past (data not shown). However, starting from different structures, the simulation results were also significantly different. This is a fundamental characteristic of disordered proteins in that these proteins have a multitude of conformations with similar energies. In order to describe the structure of disordered proteins, rather than specifying convergence to a singular structure, there is a need to describe the conformation ensemble32. This is computationally very expensive and time consuming. Knowing that the complete folding ensembles through MD have been established for small proteins only, it was decided that it would be wise to develop a method for molecular dynamics of the most experimentally well studied and functional part of caseins, the -casein phosphopeptide (-CPP). This way the simulations could be validation though experiment. Furthermore, -CPP on its own is an industrially and medically important peptide27, simulation of which would provide insight into its conformational preferences.

1.3 Aim of the thesis
Due to the challenges encountered, there were two goals of this thesis. The first was to demonstrate that vitamin D3 binds to the casein micelle and to compare this binding affinity to other macromolecules in milk, thus establishing the possible fate of vitamin D in fortified dairy products. The second goal emerged from the dearth of knowledge on the internal organization of the casein micelle and, by corollary, that of individual caseins. To this end, MD simulations were used to determine the conformation ensemble of -casein phosphopeptide (f1-25) in its native environment and to validate the method by crossexperimental correlation. The thesis begins with a review of the structure and function of VD3 and milk proteins, with special emphasis on caseins (Chapter 2). This is followed by the development of an assay for VD3 binding to test its efficacy and limitations (Chapter 3) where the results of VD3 binding in the presence of caseins and other food-based macromolecules are explored. Finally, to improve upon the current structural disagreements on casein structure, the structure of -casein phosphopeptide (f1-25) using MD simulation is reported (Chapter 4).

Chapter 2: Structure & function of vitamin D3 and milk proteins
2.1 Vitamin D3
In the 1920s, it was recognized that amelioration of rickets status could be achieved by periodic exposure to sunlight or administration of cod liver oil2, 11, 33-35. Within a short time of that realization, the principal antirachitic component was isolated and named vitamin D36. The process of irradiation of patients as well as foods to provide antirachitic protection was patented in 1925 by the University of Wisconsin4. Shortly thereafter, a great deal of work dealing with chemistry of vitamin D ensued, which led to the assignment of vitamin D2 and D3 as 28 and 27 Chemical compounds carbon steroids, of their respectively4. these two Figure 2.1 Chemical Structure of Vitamin D2.

progenitors reflect

aetiology.

Ergocalciferol is derived from ergosterol which occurs especially in fungi (hence the prefix ergo- from the group of fungi known as ergot) as well as in yeasts and plants36. The etymology of cholecalciferol, on the other hand, comes from its precursor compound cholesterol which derives its prefix chole- from Greek meaning bile, pointing to the fact that it is anabolized in the liver and sent to the gall bladder to be stored as bile37. So the term vitamin D is a catch-all for seco-steroids (D2 ­ ergocalciferol, D3 ­ cholecalciferol)

in which one of the steroid rings has been broken (seco is latin for to cut). Vitamin D2 and D3 form through UV-B (270-300nm) irradiation of their respective sterols; ergosterol in fungi, yeasts and plants and 7-dehydrocholestrol in humans3,
38

. The difference

between the two vitamin D derivatives is only in the double bond and methyl group which are present in D2 but absent in D3 (Figure 2.1). In humans, activation of VD3 involves hydroxylation at the 25th carbon in the liver followed by a second hydroxylation at the 1st carbon in the kidney1, 4. This activated compound is a hormone commonly referred to as 1,25(OH)2D or calcitrol. Once released into circulation, calcitrol is transported by vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) to various organs33. The ultimate molecular target of calcitrol is the vitamin D receptor (VDR) found in the nuclei of cells1. After calcitrol binding, VDR becomes activated as a transcription factor, modulating gene expression for specific absorption and transport proteins destined for the distal large intestine39. These proteins transport calcium and phosphate ions from the intestine and into the bloodstream. The skeletal system incorporates excess ions through accretion in bones2. Hence, VD3 maintains homeostasis of blood calcium and phosphates through dietary absorption from the duodenum and jejunum40. In the case where these dietary ions are unavailable, VD3 can stimulate bone resorption to maintain homeostasis2. Aside from this classic role, VD3 is involved in osteoblast formation, fetus development, pancreatic function, neural function, and immunity34. Positive benefits of prolonged high serum VD3 levels are associated with lower rates of malignant cancers, and of multiple sclerosis3, 7, 38.

9

2.1.1 Nutrition In November 2010, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee commissioned jointly by the governments of United States and Canada, published a report regarding population needs of vitamin D. The committee conducted a comprehensive review of evidence regarding benefits of VD3 to skeletal outcomes41. Although benefits of VD3 are pleiotropic34, for methodological uniformity the committee focused on bone health as the indicator of physiological outcome. Based on the review, the committee concluded that recommended dietary allowance (RDA) per day for VD3 should be 400 International Units (IU) for persons between the age of 0-12 months, 600 IU per day for ages 1-70 years and 800 IU/day for individuals older than 70. Clinically, VD3 status of an individual is based on serum blood levels of 25(OH)D8. These RDAs correspond to serum 25(OH)D levels of 50nM. For reference, 1g (386.7g/mol) of VD3 is 40 million IU. The revised RDAs were a modest increase from the past, but immediately after the review was published, many scientific experts and organizations criticized its outcomes. This emerged from the confusion where certain studies pointed out the benefits of high serum 25(OH)D whereas others showed benefit at low levels of 25(OH)D. Another point of contention was the claim that the revised RDA recommendations were good for 97.5% of the population, with the remaining 2.5% high risk individuals with higher VD3 requirements to have sufficient 25(OH)D blood levels. This list included individuals suffering from malabsorption, celiac sprue disease, inflammatory distal bowel disease, osteoporosis, obesity, etc. 42. As well, the IOM report suggested that the North American population mean for serum 25(OH)D was ~50nM, concluding that there was no need for supplementation. However, if the population mean for serum 25(OH)D was 50nM, and the adequate cut-off for sufficient 25(OH)D is also 50nM, this would suggest that half of
10

the population was deficient. Many leading experts have suggested that the optimal 25(OH)D blood levels should be ~75nM to mitigate risks of fractures42. Based on this estimate, the 2010 Statscan study shows that during the period of 2007-2009, only 4% of Canadians are meeting their vitamin D needs9. 2.1.2 Barriers to adequate levels of VD3 Multiple barriers prevent adequate VD3 status in the Canadian population5. The major source of VD3 is the sun, exposure to which initiates cutaneous synthesis of VD31. This major source is hindered by geographical, environmental, cultural, and physiological factors2, 5. There are very few dietary sources of VD3, with many sources not regulary consumed (e.g., cod liver oil, fatty fish)
38

. To compensate for the lack of sunlight and

paucity of VD3 in nutritional sources, reliance on fortified foods and supplements has increased5. Fortification of VD3 is mandatory in Canada for fluid milk (100IU/250mL) and margarine (53IU/10g)5. Cross-sectional studies suggest current fortification practices are ineffective given antiquated fortification guidelines and under-fortification of regulated foods43. As well, fluid milk consumption has been steadily declining over the past decades and forecasts indicate regressing demands (Figure 2.2a)10. Lactose intolerance and maldigestion has become increasingly commonplace in Canadians44-46. Scientific evidence and population needs thus necessitate development of additional foods fortified with VD3 as cost-effective measures to improving public health. 2.1.3 Sources Cutaneous exposure of skin is the major source of VD3 for humans39. A variety of geographical, environmental, cultural, and physiological factors determine the capacity to produce VD3 which include extreme latitudes, seasonal changes, increased melanin pigmentation, topical application of sunscreen, or cultural influences on dress code5.
11

Ageing also reduces VD3 production capacity due to decreased precursor concentration. Of the natural sources of VD3, cod liver oil has the highest concentration, followed by fatty fish, mammalian liver, eggs and dairy

products47. Although the benefits of cod liver oil have been known for

generations, it is not normally consumed3. As for other sources, VD3 is only available in trace amounts47. Hence natural sources are not viable for

recommended dietary VD3 intake38. The third source is supplementation of VD3 in diet either through vitamin D capsules or
Figure 2.2 History of (A) milk and (B) cheese consumption in Canada. Adapted from Wolfram 10 Alpha.

through food fortification8. These two have become increasingly popular in recent years given reduced exposure to sunlight in North America48.

2.1.4 Fortification of dairy products Milk intended for processed dairy goods is not fortified with VD35. In Canada, regulations regarding fortified products are overseen by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). To increase public health, the CFIA has mandated the fortification of fluid milk with vitamin D at 100IU/250mL or 25nM5. Unfortunately, evidence indicates that milk fortification alone is inadequate due to out-dated fortification guidelines as well

12

as under-fortification5, 43. As mentioned, fluid milk consumption has steadily declined from 140kg/person/year in 1970 to 35kg/person/year in 200710 (Figure 2.2). Furthermore, variable VD3 levels have been found in fortified milk, with many below the stated value. A study of Ontario retail milk samples conducted in 2000 found that only 20% of skim milk, 40% of 2% milk fat, and 20% of whole milk contained the recommended levels43. It is unknown whether vitamin D variability is due to inconsistencies in fortification or to instability of the vitamin itself.43 Conversely, cheese consumption has steadily risen over the years, most likely owing to variety and its versatility of use in foods10 (Figure 2.2). Cheese is a good source of calcium and contains only traces of lactose. However, transfer of VD3 from fortified milk to cheese has proven unreliable6-8. The current fortification methods involve addition of an emulsion containing VD3 solubilized by P80 to the milk. Comparative analysis of three fortification methods for Cheddar cheese demonstrated 39-59% of the initial VD3 load was lost, depending on fortification method, with loss attributed to processing conditions that could lead to oxidation6. Hence, the speculation is that fortification using the current emulsification technique cannot sufficiently protect VD3 during processing. It may be possible to protect VD3 by binding it to other food-grade carrier molecules such as caseins or whey proteins12, 14. The fate of VD3 in fortified milk, whether it becomes involved in competitive binding with caseins and whey proteins, or whether it stays bound to the carrier molecule (P80), remains unclear.

2.2 Milk proteins
Milk proteins can be broadly classified into casein and whey proteins. In bovine milk, the dry protein weight fraction consists of 20% whey and 80% casein. Whey protein is a mixture of many small, globular proteins whereas the casein (cn) fraction is a 4:1:3.5:1.5 weight ratios of s1, s2, , and -casein.49

2.3 Whey proteins
Whey is generated as a by-product during cheese processing (in the pressing step) and contains a mixture of globular proteins that can be isolated by membrane filtration followed by spray drying50. The protein isolate, usually known as whey protein isolate (WPI) has four major fractions: -lactoglobulin (-Lg) (65%), -lactalbumin (25%), serum albumin (8%) and low concentrations of immunoglobulins (2%)35. Of these major fractions, only -lactoglobulin has shown propensity towards VD3 binding11, 12, 51, 52. 2.3.1 Structure of -lactoglobulin Bovine -Lg consists of 162 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of ~18 kDa. Due to sequence and structural homology, it belongs to the lipocalin family, which can bind hydrophobic ligands.53 The structure of -Lg is composed of eight up and down antiparallel -strands folded into a flattened cone or a calyx (Figure 2.3). The -sheet barrel is surrounded by three helices, one at the bottom of the calyx and two at the top. There are seven connective loops three of which are short and rigid while the remaining four are long, flexible and mobile. The calyx is closed off by one -helix (Trp-19) while the mobile loop (residue 85-90) acts as an access lid` to the hydrophobic barrel. The stability of the tertiary

14

structure is governed by two disulphide bonds formed by four out of the five cysteine residues.54 2.3.2 Function of -lactoglobulin It has been shown that -Lg is responsible for transport of small hydrophobic ligands which, together with the evidence of its fast catabolism35 stability at low pH and binding at high pH55, has led to the Figure 2.3 Crystal Structure of -lactoglobulin hypothesis that the evolutionary function of -Lg is that of ligand transport11, 12, 54.
adapted from the RSCB database, showing the two binding sites for VD3 (yellow), one in the red -sheet barrel and the other on the surface of the hydrophobic barrel and in line with the adjacent 11 helix.

The structure of -Lg is affected by changes in pH and temperature. The changes in pH are associated with concomitant electrostatic changes associated with the protonation state of negative and positive amino acid residues55. These affect protein denaturation (and coagulation), dimerization and ligand binding properties50, 54. The monomer-dimer equilibrium of -Lg is a direct function of pH in which the range for dimerization is from 3.0-8.0, outside which it becomes monomeric. In the dimeric state, the units are linked via twelve hydrogen bonds. The most important pH-induced conformational change is the Tanford transition occurring in the loop forming region (residues 85­90) between pH 7.5 - 8.556. This conformational change, which is brought about by protonation of Glu89, mediates access to the central calyx and allows entry of hydrophobic ligands into the sheet barrel55.

15

2.3.3 Ligand binding -Lg can bind hydrophobic ligands at two sites ­ one inside the central calyx and the other in a groove formed by an adjacent -helix and -barrel. Crystal structures of -Lg with bound retinol, retinoic acid, palmitic acid and vitamin D3 have been discovered. All related studies have been conducted at pH 8.0 at which the hydrophobic calyx of -Lg is accessible. 12, 51, 52, 55, 57-59

2.4 Caseins
The name Casein comes from the latin word caseus which means cheese, pointing to one of the end products of these proteins in the body of ruminant mammals. The four main casein proteins are named according to their electrophoretic mobility. 16 2.4.1 Structure The most important function of casein is the transport of the insoluble calcium phosphate (Ksp 2.70×10-7). This is accomplished by the formation of soluble micelles that sequester the calcium through phosphoserine groups on caseins. The internal structure of the micelle is highly-debated50. The inherent structural heterogeneity of caseins, imparts a characterization challenge that is relatively more demanding than for a globular protein. The different amino acids are colour coded to five distinct types according to the key in Figure 2.4Error! Reference source not found.. Caseins are mostly uncharged proteins with charged moieties dotting the chain. The proteins, s1-cn and s2-cn contain the highest number of charged sites and the highest number of phosphorylated centres (PCs); -cn contains a high proportion of neutral residues while -cn contains the neutral residues towards its N-terminus region prior to the chymosin-sensitive bond (105/106).

16

The ionizable residues of -cn are isolated towards the N-terminus region while the hydrophobic residues occur after circa the 50th residue towards the C-terminus.

There are several PCs in caseins all of which are phosphoserines, except for phosphothreonines in s2 casein at positions 144 and 168. PCs occur individually or as clusters of three. In addition, not all serines, threonines are phosphorylated. Three members of the casein family, s1-cn, s2-cn and -cn, can be precipitated by the addition of calcium in ionic form whereas -cn is non-responsive to calcium addition63. When present in mixtures containing the other caseins, -cn exhibits colloidal stability through steric repulsion, effectively inhibiting precipitation reactions15,
49, 64-67

. This protein is

known as a polyelectrolyte brush` as it is anchored to the surface of casein micelles through its C-terminus region, and extends from the surface to form a polyelectrolyte corona49 (Figure 2.5).

17

2.4.2 Function Casein micelles have multiple functions which are related to their origin

(mammary secretory cells) and destination (young, since it is their only mode of nutrition acquisition). Once ingested in the milk solution, the caseins forms a gel as the pH of stomach is less than the isoelectric point of caseins (pH 1.5 vs. pI Figure 2.5 Hypothesized model of the casein micelle 4.6). Gel formation occurs due to and s2 casein shown in red, -casein shown in blue,
and -casein shown on the surface in green. Chemistry.

For ruminant mammals, the gel is formed in the stomach through cleavage of the cn polyelectrolyte brush by chymosin. This results in the loss of intermicellar steric repulsion, and more collisions of the core micelle. At that core level distance, van der Waals interactions become significant and the gel formation is initiated. Even though these gel formation mechanisms differ, the outcome is the same. Gel formation in the stomach slows down breakdown and increases calcium bioavailability by increasing gel residence time in the GI tract. As the gels degrade, they release many essential amino acids50,
68

. Caseins contain all essential amino acids and their proteolytic digestion

ensures a rich supply of amino acids to the host. In addition, since the gel is degraded through piece-wise peptide cleavage, bioactive peptides are also formed directly in the stomach. The assumption that a protein requires a set 3D structure to function has been superceded by rising evidence showing that many disordered proteins have specific functions69.
18

These functions can be categorized into five broad classes: entropic chains,

effectors, assemblers, display sites and scavengers70. In this scheme, the caseins are classed as scavengers of calcium phosphate. To avoid confusion with

denatured proteins, caseins are described as rheomorphic proteins60. The paucity of secondary structure is due to the lack of cysteine residues for disulphide bridging and an abundance of proline residues71. Hence, casein conformation is essentially dictated by the local environment where their flexible nature allows them to go with the flow`
72

. The

rheomorphic nature of caseins allows fast sequestration of calcium species by providing nucleation sites at phosphorylated serines or threonines, thereby preventing pathological calcification of secretory cells73. More generally, such conformational flexibility permits stable complexation with calcium phosphate much more rapidly than a globular conformation could allow74. There are three amino acids in eukaryotes that are phosphorylated ­ phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine76. Of these, phosphoserine is the most common, followed by phosphothreonine and the rare phosphotyrosine. Complexation of calcium occurs through phosphorylated sites on caseins. The calcium binding capacity of the various caseins is proportional to their molar phosphate content. This type of behaviour is synonymous with structural proteins that form templates for mineralized hard shells, eg. calcium-binding proteins for bone (acidic glycoprotein-75, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein)77, dentin for teeth78, exoskeletons of certain organisms79.
19

Industrial exploitations of casein are evident in the myriad variety of dairy products available on the shelves of grocery markets (e.g., cheese, yogurt, and ice-cream). Current trends in micellar engineering include utilization of casein micelles as nanoscopic vehicles for nutraceutical and drug delivery14, 80 due to their generally-regarded-as-safe (GRAS) standard, nanoscopic size64, UV-oxidation protection14 and controllable selfassembly81, 82. Of all caseins, the phosphorylated peptide of -casein f(1-25) has recently come under increased scrutiny due to its ease of isolation and stability during processing27. Functionally, this peptide can be used for calcium phosphate fortification or medical applications such as teeth biomineralization83, 84. There is a lack of consensus over its structure, owing to its membership to the class of intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs). A key reason why the structure of this peptide is important is because it contains a major epitope for IgE binding associated with milk allergy. With 2.5% of infants affected by this allergy, knowledge of its structure becomes medically-relevant85, 86. Compilation of data over the past thirty years suggests minimal consensus on structure (see Table 4.1) due to the difficulty in experimentally studying IDPs as they are structurally heterogeneous24. Computer simulations have recently emerged as a useful tool to understand disordered peptides as they are not limited by experimental constraints that result in structural heterogeneity and aggregation26.

Chapter 3: Binding of vitamin D3 to food-based macromolecules
3.1 Abstract
Most strategies for fortification of dairy products with vitamin D3 (VD3) are based on emulsification. However, studies have shown lack of VD3 retention during Cheddar cheese processing and possible oxidation during storage using this method. There is thus a need to develop a more robust fortification strategy. As a first step towards achieving this goal, we present the development of a simple approach to characterize the binding of VD3 to food-related macromolecules (MMs) that may be used for enrichment. We evaluated VD3 binding to sodium caseinate (SCN), hydroxylpropyl--cyclodextrin (HPCD), whey protein isolate (WPI) and polysorbate 80 (P80). At 10g/L MM, the binding affinity was P80>SCN>HPCD>WPI. However, at concentrations  1g/L, SCN provided the most effective binding to VD3 as it was below its critical micelle concentration (CMC), where its solvent-accessible hydrophobic surface area was highest. Above its CMC, SCN showed preferential binding to other caseins rather than VD3. WPI did not show any significant binding. HPCD, on the other hand showed excellent binding (0.053mg/mL at 100g/L). These results suggested that strategies using SCN and/or HPCD could provide an alternative method for fortifying cheese with VD3. In addition, as their protective abilities are known in the literature, these two MMs may also protect VD3 during processing of Cheddar cheese.

3.2 Introduction
Vitamin D3 (VD3) deficiency is a largely unacknowledged public health issue, both in Canada and abroad40. Chronic VD3 deficiency prevents proper bone mineralization, growth and remodelling and can lead to rickets in children and osteoporosis or osteomalacia in adults3. Clinically, VD3 status is measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D ­ 25(OH)D. Low levels of 25(OH)D (<50nM) are associated with increased risk of incidence and mortality from various cancers while high levels (75nM) are associated with inverse incident risks of rheumatoid arthritis, microbial infections, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and multiple sclerosis34. Yet, meta-analysis of VD3 correlations with health and disease studies has revealed that 75nM of 25(OH)D concentration in blood is necessary to reap the most health benefits from VD3 consumption 4% of the Canadian population is above this threshold9. 3.2.1 Necessity for an alternative assay to fluorescence The development of new and improved VD3 fortification technologies based on dairy proteins requires that an appropriate method of evaluating binding affinity be used. In the recent past, fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry have been evaluated as tools to determine protein-ligand interactions. However, these standard methods require a consistent solvent composition to avoid complicated corrections for subsequent data analysis and to ensure that changes in signal response truly arise from protein-ligand interactions. This is especially difficult if the ligand is hydrophobic and protein hydrophilic. One of the techniques used to determine the thermodynamics of the casein-VD3 interaction is based on the changes in protein-Tryptophan fluorescence following the

. Yet, only

addition of VD3 dissolved in ethanol to proteins in aqueous solution. Even though a decrease in fluorescence is observed, the decrease may not be due to the binding interaction, but rather from a reduction in excitation and emission intensity due to scattering88. This is known as the inner filter effect`. If a hydrophobic substance dissolved in an organic solvent is titrated into an aqueous solution with protein, the result is a colloidal suspension that scatters light at both excitation and emission wavelengths. The term originates from this phenomenon ­ inner indicating that the effect is inherent in the sample and filter refers to the reduction in excitation and emission light intensity as it enters and exits the sample88. This effect can be avoided by reducing the concentration of the titrant, (eg. VD3) but this invalidates equations used to model changes in response88. As this is not the topic of this thesis, a good reference on this matter is written by van de Weert, 201088. Another technique that is useful in studying protein-ligand interactions is isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). This technique is considered the gold standard in studying thermodynamics of interactions89-91. The prerequisite for ITC is that the solvent for the ligand and for the protein be identical to avoid enthalpy changes arising from the use of dissimilar solvents (solvation energy) 90, 92. Given the inherent requirement of identical solvent conditions for both techniques, the study of VD3 binding to proteins using these techniques is challenging, as this vitamin is very hydrophobic while milk proteins are generally hydrophilic. The efficient assay herein developed is an indirect measurement of the interaction between VD3 and various macromolecules that avoids the complication of having dissimilar solvent conditions.

23

The basic premise of this approach is based on the shaken-flask and solvent evaporation methods used in the pharmaceutical industry93. In short, a known quantity of VD3 is added to a test tube and shaken with a solution containing the macromolecule of interest. The macromolecule solution is removed and the undissolved VD3 is quantified. 3.2.2 Selection of test molecules The macromolecules tested with the developed assay were selected based on VD3 fortification in raw milk and its lack of retention in dairy products. The common fortification method (with a polysorbate 80-based microemulsion) is unreliable for cheese manufacture as the added VD3 is not protected against acidification and fermentation conditions6,
94

. The goal of this study was to determine whether other possible food

macromolecules could be used as VD3 binding agents at the native pH of milk (pH 6.7). These macromolecules included dairy proteins (sodium caseinate, whey protein isolate), and hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin. Binding of VD3 with P80 was also determined. Sodium caseinate (SCN) contains four proteins that arrange into micellar structures when hydrated49. The micellar structure is capable of binding and transporting calcium and is also the main ingredient that provides the structure and texture of processed dairy foods ­ yogurt, cheese, and ice cream6, 7, 13, 17, 51. Moreover, casein has been shown to bind with vitamin D214 and D351 and has shown to protect vitamin D2 against UV degradation14. Whey protein isolate (WPI) consists of the proteins that remain in the milk serum after the caseins are removed. WPI primarily consists of -lactalbumin and -lactoglobulin, with the latter implicated in binding and transport of several hydrophobic ligands, including VD311,
12, 51, 52, 57, 95, 96

. Denatured whey protein isolate (dWPI) solutions,

obtained by heating at 70oC for 1hr, were also tested as denaturation of -lactoglobulin

24

has been shown to occur during pasteurization of milk97, 98 which may alter VD3 binding equilibrium between caseins and whey proteins. Polysorbate 80 (P80) is a food-based emulsifier that forms the basis of the currently used method to fortify raw milk with VD3. It has a very high emulsifying capacity even at low concentrations. It is able to bind to high concentration of hydrophobic molecules because of its low CMC (0.012mM). As it has the ability to form micellar structures, it offers a good comparison to casein micelles in terms of binding mechanism. Finally, hydroxypropyl--Cyclodextrin (HPCD) is a molecule similar to -lactoglobulin in that both have an internal hydrophobic binding site58 and both can bind VD399.

25

3.3 Materials and methods
VD3 (>99%), ethanol (EtOH) (>95%), SCN, P80, HP--CD, NaCl, NaH2PO4, and Na2HPO4 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada) and used without further purification. WPI (92% protein content) was a gift from Fonterra Inc. (Mississauga, ON, Canada). Macromolecule solutions were prepared in 0.1M PBS buffer pH 6.7 (80mM NaCl, 5.65mM Na2HPO4, 3.05mM NaH2PO4). Figure 3.1 outlines the binding assay schematic. Initially, 0.1mL of a 10g/L stock solution of VD3 in EtOH was dispensed into a 15mL Falcon tube (BD FalconTM, Fisher Scientific, Markham, ON, Canada), placed under vacuum (28-29 inHg) for 1hr (Step 1), and air-dried in a fume hood for 24hrs, leaving behind a layer of adsorbed VD3 (Step 2). This initial adsorbed layer, which nominally contained 1mg of VD, is termed VDi for initial VD mass which is confirmed by EtOH control during the experiment. A 10mL MM solution is added to the primed tube (Step 3), which was then placed on a VWR rocking platform (Mississauga, ON, Canada). To ensure equilibrium conditions the platform was automated to rock for 24 hrs at a 15o tilt and a rocking rate of 20 cycles/min (Step 4). The time for equilibrium was determined using kinetic data at 5, 24, and 48 hrs. The solution added to the VD3primed tube was either a control ­ phosphate buffer (PBS), reverse osmosis (RO) water or EtOH ­ or a MM solution: SCN, P80, WPI, or HPCD. The mass of VD3 that was solubilized in the MM solution was termed VDs. After equilibration, the MM solution was decanted (Step 5), and the tube was washed 5x with 5mL of RO water to remove any traces of MM (Step 6). Washing was performed gently to prevent shear removal of VD3 layer. This was done by tilting the falcon tube allowing the water to flow down test tube wall. After decanting the water from step 6, the residual water was evaporated for 24

26

hours to prevent VD3 loss. The remaining VD3 at the bottom of the tube was then resolubilized in 10mL EtOH (Step 7). The VD3 concentration was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 240nm (Step 8), which has the largest dynamic range and provided good sensitivity (Figure 3.2). This final concentration was converted to mass (by multiplying by EtOH volume 10mL) and is termed VDf. The relationship between the three variables is:
Eq 3.1

With this equation, the mass of VD3 in the macromolecule solution compared to the PBS control was evaluated and used as an indicator of binding. All tests were conducted at standard laboratory conditions (298K, 1 atm). Hydrodynamics of P80, SCN and VD3 in PBS were measured for particle size using the Malvern Mastersizer (Worcestershire, UK) and -potential was measured using Brookhaven 90Plus Particle Size Analyzer (Holtsville, USA).

3.4 Observations
3.4.1 Experimental remarks When EtOH was evaporated from the test tube, a smooth, transparent light-yellow layer of VD3 was formed (Figure 3.1b). This was desired, as layer-breakage was unwanted during the course of the experiment. As well, since VD3 is hydrophobic, the test tube selection was based on a hydrophobic and inert plastic material. Tests for adsorption of
28

VD3 with borosilicate glass test tubes showed that the VD3 layer readily desorbed during experimentation due to the polarity of the substrate. Hence, plastic Falcon tubes were used for the experiments. Adsorption at the bottom of the Falcon tubes during the experiments (Figure 3.1, Step 4) was necessary to avoid the introduction of a filtration step and to minimize errors. Upon adding the MM solution to the VD3-primed tubes, the VD3 layer started to become slightly white, and over 24hrs became completely white/cream-coloured (Figure 3.1c, d, e). Layer-whitening occurred due to exchange of VD3 between the solid and the aqueous solution that etches the surface due to the movement of VD3 molecules into the solution, thereby scattering the light crossing through the previously transparent layer and making it appear white and opaque. This phenomenon was independent of the type of aqueous solution added. Depending on the capacity of the MM to bind VD3, layer thickness is also reduced (Figure 3.1e). Following equilibration, each tube was visually inspected for layer-breakage, for which there was no evidence. To further investigate whether there was microscopic layer breakage, post-binding recovery from the aqueous solution was performed (Section 3.4.3 ). Solubility was expressed in mg and was converted from mg/mL by multiplying all concentrations by 10mL.

Furthermore, since all measurements of

VD3 were conducted in EtOH, it is unlikely that there would be any absorbance from the protein moieties, as the protein MMs were insoluble in EtOH. The large molar absorptivity coefficient, 5384.96 Lmol-1cm-1 results in a sensitivity of 13.6L/g. As a result of high absorbance, the dynamic range of the assay was stopped at 0.1g/L [VD3]; further increases were non-linear. Although the absorbance range for conventional UV/Vis spectrophotometers is from 0 to 4 absorbance units (AU)101, deviations were observed at concentrations of 0.20 g/L which placed the absorbance response at 3 AU. 3.4.3 Assay efficiency The PBS control was selected for determination of assay efficiency. After the rocking cycle of 24hrs, a 1mL aliquot of the PBS solution was dispensed into a clean 15mL Falcon tube and dried in vacuum for 24 hours. Subsequently, 10mL of ethanol was added to solubilize VD3. Drying of the water was done in order to avoid spectral changes that would occur due to dilution of ethanol preventing proper interpolation of VDs concentration from the standard curve. After measuring VD3 concentration, the efficiency was calculated by the following formula:

Eq 3.2

From the nine runs, two were statistical outliers and although have been shown in the runs plot, they were not included in the analysis. The runs plot shows that the assay is operating at 99.9±1.3% efficiency. This was not a good test of efficiency as PBS, which has low solubilization capacity, also has higher error by percentage. When this is incorporated in the equation above, the error is compounded and efficiencies greater
108

than 100% are observed. The expectation was that, due to the washing step (Step

6), there would be an underestimation of VDs which would result in consistently lower efficiencies than 100%. If the error was due to the initial dispensing of VDi aliquot in ethanol, then a deviation of 7% from the nominal value of 1mg would be required to cause a supposed increase in

efficiency to 107%. This may not be instrumentally related but due to the clearing of ethanol from the Eppendorf tip. If the efficiency is truly 99.92% it would have to be owed to the lack of filtration and extraction steps that can result in loss of efficiency. A limitation of the efficiency test is that efficiency was only accounted for PBS and not in samples containing macromolecules. In order to give the assay rigour, one issue that must be explored in the future is the direct extraction of VD3 from solutions containing macromolecules to determine efficiency.
31

3.5 Results and discussion
Due to the lack of data on lower and upper limits of VD3 binding, five orders of magnitude of MM concentrations were tested - 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 g/L made in 0.1M, pH 6.7, PBS buffer solutions. Aliquots (10mL) were added to four VD3-primed tubes and after equilibration; VDf was measured to calculate VDs. Each concentration range of a specific MM was always conducted with three controls: EtOH, PBS buffer and RO water to verify VDi and to ensure control consistency to calculate amount of binding by the MM.

When the MM solution is added to a VD3-primed tube, some of the molecules from the adsorbed layer are solubilized in the PBS buffer. These solubilized molecules then bind onto the hydrophobic areas of the MM, thus shifting the equilibrium from the solvent to the MM. To maintain equilibrium, more solid dissolves in the solvent. VD3 continues to solubilize until either its supply runs out or the binding

32

capacity of the macromolecule is reached. Qualitatively, in this case, the solubility equilibrium was established at ~24hrs, which is within 3% of the final value at 48hrs mark. Although there was a small increase, the distribution of VDs at 24hr and that of the 48hr mark makes either indistinguishable from the other. Thus, to minimize experimental time, and obtaining maximum solubility, 24hrs were deemed sufficient for all remaining solubility experiments.

3.5.2 Water and phosphate buffer As expected, water (R/O) did not solubilize a significant amount of VD3 0.014±0.002g/L (0.14±0.02mg in 10mL). Similarly, solubility of VD3 in PBS was low and only slightly higher than that of pure water (R/O) at 0.018±0.01g/L (0.18±0.01mg in 10mL). Literature values vary on the solubility of VD3 in water, however the range is between 0.0077 0.23g/L102. Although it is tempting to state that the experiment was a success relative to the literature values and to the controls, the range itself was too wide and should be taken with considerable doubt. It is likely that compilation of VD3 solubilities from different methods have yielded different results.

measuring solubility alone, the solvation and dispersibility of VD3 in PBS buffer were measured. The high VDf value and very low amounts recovered for VDs in the PBS efficiency test indicated that

very low amounts of VD3 were solubilized in PBS (Figure 3.5). As the particle size distribution of VD3 in PBS ranged from 0.05-2.89µm, this also strongly suggested dispersion rather than solubilization [as was observed in the P80 particle size distribution (Figure 3.10)]. For practical considerations, VD3 solubility in the presence of the various macromolecules was compared to PBS and R/O results to determine binding. Binding was calculated based on the difference between VDs of PBS and VDs of macromolecule.

3.5.3 Whey protein isolate (native/denatured) WPI has minimal binding to VD3 at pH 6.7 (Figure 3.5). This work confirmed earlier findings where after cheese fortification, the collected whey contained no traces of VD36. There are two mechanisms that can account for this observation. As mentioned before, lactoglobulin is the one whey protein shown to have binding affinity towards VD3. The first of the two mechanisms is that, at pH 6.7, -lactoglobulin is in dimeric form, which

34

prevents access to the hydrophobic ligand binding site on its surface. The second possible mechanism is based on the fact that, at pH 6.7, the residues of 85-90 involved in a connective loop between -sheets are in a folded conformation closing off access to the external environment (see Figure 2.3). If this study had been performed at pH 8.5, the so-called Tanford-transition of Glu9 from the calyx to the periphery of the protein would have permitted access of the non-polar molecules in solution to the central calyx

. This would have registered

as an increase in the amount of binding of VD3 and macroscopically a decrease in the VD3 layer at the bottom of the primed tube. If this hypothesis is correct, then during cheese processing, it is unlikely that any VD3 binds to any of the whey proteins as the entire

processing of the product is done at pH at or below 6.7. Thermal treatment of

the WPI (dWPI) slightly increased binding observed, which was expected as internal hydrophobic moieties would be exposed59. However, at pH 8, this has been shown to decrease the ability of -lactoglobulin to bind VD311, 12. At the native pH of milk 6.7, however, owing to Tanford transition, there was no access to the hydrophobic calyx of  lactoglobulin and therefore an absence of VD3 interaction via this mechanism. So denaturation of WPI and exposure of the hydrophobic groups has the relative effect of
35

slightly increasing VD3 binding. Relative to native WPI, this increase was ~300% higher, though still very small compared to P80 and other MMs used in this study. 3.5.4 Cyclodextrin Hydroxypropyl--Cyclodextrin (HPCD) is an excellent solubilising agent for hydrophobic compounds and as it contains a hydrophobic core made of sugars. The binding curve for VD3 in the presence of HPCD showed a continual log scale increase. On the linear scale, there was an appreciable decrease in the change in binding especially above 1g/L of the macromolecule. This suggested that there may be another interaction involved. Literature data on HPCD and VD3 interaction indicates that a 2:1 binding may occur104. That is to say at high concentrations, two molecules of HPCD bind to one molecule of VD3. Therefore, increasing the concentration of HPCD did not lead to a linear increase in the amount of solubilized VD3. Another cyclodextrin molecule, -CD, solubilizes almost the same amount of VD3 as HPCD. This molecule is a cheaper alternative to HPCD, and according Figure 3.7 also has the potential to be used for VD3 fortification. 3.5.5 Sodium caseinate Sodium caseinate has the potential to solubilise hydrophobic substances. The binding curve for SCN followed the expected trend up until 10g/L where a plateau was observed (0.61±0.01mg) for a concentration of 10g/L. At 100g/L SCN, a noticeable decrease was observed. To explain this trend, one has to recall that sodium caseinate in solution forms micelle-like structures maintained only by interactions between nonpolar residues on protein chains. The internal structure is a network of hydrophobic surfaces interacting with each other15,
24

. This network of hydrophobic surfaces occurs above the critical

micelle concentration (CMC). Below the CMC, caseins exist as individual monomers
36

with high surface areas exposed to the water solution. As the monomeric SCN

solution was introduced into the VD3 primed tubes, due to the large solventaccessible-surface-area per monomer

(SASA/monomer), a large amount of VD3 bound to the SCN. Increasing the concentration of SCN, still below CMC, increased the cumulative-hydrophobicsurface-area (CHSA) available and more

VD3 molecules bound to the protein. Although there was still an increase in VD3 binding, there was a decrease in the slope of binding. As the CMC was approached, there was some evidence of micelle formation. So, although the increase in concentration of SCN increased CHSA, the rise was relatively less due to a reduction in SASA/monomer as a result of micelle formation before CMC. Consequently, a decrease in the slope of binding was observed. At the CMC (~1g/L)105, there was a small increase in binding corresponding to the increase in concentration of the macromolecule. However, there was also a continual decrease in the slope of binding, owing to the increase in preferential intramolecular hydrophobic interactions of casein monomers, respectively. The same was observed at 10g/L SCN. At 100g/L SCN, the hydrophobic interactions of caseins became so strong that although the concentration of casein increased, the CHSA was lower than at 10g/L, resulting in a decrease in VD3 binding as well. Another explanation could be related to
37

experimental error associated with the SCN coating the VD3 layer to prevent solubilization of VD3 molecules. If that were true, it could be tested by adding the 100g/L solution of SCN to one VD3-primed Falcon tube, and after 24 hrs, transferring the same solution to another VD3-primed tube. If true, then some VD3 would solubilize in the second tube as well as the first, as a significant portion of SCN molecules would have the potential to bind VD3. The highest VD3 binding for SCN was at 10g/L of MM (0.042±0.001mg/mL). Past literature has reported VD2 binding of 0.052±0.003mg/mL with 50g/L MM14. Accounting for molecular weight differences, the molar binding for the past literature was 0.131±0.008mM for VD2 and for the current work of VD3 binding, 0.109±0.003mM. There could be three reasons for the higher binding of VD2 compared to VD3. First, more SCN was used to bind VD3. Second, ergocalciferol contains an additional methyl group which adds to its hydrophobic surface area and increases its propensity for binding to SCN. Third, the procedure used in the previous study utilized high pressure homogenization after addition of the vitamin to disrupt the casein-casein hydrophobic interactions effectively increasing the CHSA as well as SASA/monomer of the system. Particle diameter of SCN micelles maintained a unimodal distribution ranging from 40nm to 1µm, with the average around 200µm (Figure 3.8) as have been reported multiple times in the literature14, 81, 106, 107. An article by Semo et al., in 2005, reported that after vitamin binding, the reconstituted casein micelles did exhibit a small change in micelle diameter from 147-156nm. The possibility that casein micelles rearranged themselves to accommodate VD3 is not difficult to conceptualize. The particle size of PBS solutions with solubilized VD3 confirmed that there were microscopic VD3 particles in the system
38

(Figure 3.6). So, the caseins in solution decorated` the surface of dispersed VD3

leading to particles ~1m in size. Binding of some caseins to VD3 reduced the number of unbound caseins resulting in a relative decrease in particle size intensity at ~ 200nm. The increase in average particle size due to VD3 binding also increased the volume per particle

and consequently, the decrease surface charge density. This can be observed with the measurement of -potential which is directly proportional to surface charge density (Figure 3.9). In the study that looked at interaction between VD2 and casein micelles, in addition to observing only a slight increase in particle size, there was no change in the morphology of the size distribution, which remained unimodal. The unimodal distribution was likely linked to procedural differences between the current and past studies. As high pressure homogenization was used after the dispersion step, the particle size distribution increased only slightly and did not exhibit bimodality. Although for the current study bimodality and a reduction in -potential pointed to the reduced stability of the casein micelles, there is potentialfor further optimization of VD3 and casein interaction through homogenization.

binding capacity for VD3. This was partially owing (0.012mM). At to a its low very CMC high

concentration (100g/L), it was able to bind all of the available VD3 adsorbed onto the tubes (1mg). Similar to SCN, there was a very small, but detectable increase in the particle size of P80

micelles with VD compared to the reference (Figure 3.10). The P80 micelles grew larger in response to accommodate VD3 shifting the distribution from 120nm to 130nm.

3.6 Conclusions
The indirect solubility assay is a simple and efficient method to characterize binding of VD3, with macromolecules. It shows that although P80 is excellent at binding to VD3, other fortifying agents such as SCN and HPCD may also be used for VD3 fortification and if optimized may protect it from the processing environment encountered. It also shows that WPI is unable to bind to VD3 at all, its denaturation leads to a small increase in binding. The molecular reason for this observation is related to the Tanford transition of 85-90 amino acid residues, which prevents access to the hydrophobic barrel of the lactoglobulin whey protein. Finally casein micelles in SCN solutions can bind to VD3. Future work could be on optimization and localization of bound VD3 in the casein micelle.

Chapter 4: Structure of -casein f(1-25)
4.1 Abstract
The secondary structure of -casein phosphopeptide 1-25 (-CPP) is currently under debate due to its intrinsic disorder. A series of replica simulations (1, 10, 100 replicas) with cumulative time of 1.0s was performed in an explicit solvent system (1atm, 298K) with 0.1M ionic strength. Prior to analysis quality assurance was performed to ensure equilibrium and absence of non-physical effects. Efficiency of sampling the conformational space was carried out by using H-bond analysis, which showed highest sampling with 100 replicas (94.6% of the theoretical maximum 527). Structural features, especially interactions between negatively charged residues E2 - 15 and 17 - R25 were responsible for incomplete sampling of conformational space owing to electrostatic repulsive forces. From the simulation, trajectory radius of gyration, H-bonding, Ramachandran plot, and DSSP secondary structure were probabilistically analysed. It was observed that -CPP adopts a highly compact structure (Rg 0.75-1.1nm, peak: 0.84nm), the conformation of which was governed mostly by local interactions rather than long range interactions. With the exception of terminal residues and Glycine (G10), most amino acids preferred bend-type structures, with a lower probability for turns due to steric repulsion. Low probability of helix and -sheet structures was also observed. Glycine was found primarily in loop-type structures due to its conformational flexibility. Furthermore, there was significant propensity towards angles observed in PPII, extended -sheet, -turn and -helical structures. Results of the simulation were in good agreement with simulations of other disordered peptides and well as experimental structural data of -CPP. Future studies with multiple replica sampling will be directed towards structural simulations of -CPP in various physicochemical conditions, membrane simulations to understand structure in presence of various divalent cations, as well as testing the method with other parts of -casein protein to observe binding to VD3.

4.2 Introduction
-casein is an abundant protein in milk composed of 209 amino acids. It is an amphipathic protein given its hydrophobic C-terminus108, and the hydrophilic N-terminus constituting of highly-charged phosphoserine residues in the fragment (1-25)71. The Nterminus contains four phosphoserines that determine the net charge of the protein. These phosphoseries are responsible for the formation of calcium phosphate nanoclusters through electrostatic sequestration109. The formation of these nanoclusters prevents ectopic calcification in mammary tissues that have high calcium flux19. In 1981, the School of Dental Science at University of Melbourne in Australia, showed that milk-derived foods can help prevent dental caries. Further investigation showed that specific casein peptides were responsible for this anticariogenic property of milk28, 83, 84. These peptides contained special phosphorylated serine residues which acted as nucleation sites for calcium and phosphate binding. Since this discovery, this technology has been patented and licensed under the name Recaldent110. One of those anticariogenic peptides is the N-terminus fragment of -casein fragment 125. This fragment (-CPP) is nutritionally active and has been effective in treating and preventing oral diseases83. It is able to mitigate biofilm formation and concomitantly favours nucleation of possibly apatitic calcium phosphates111. It has been also implicated in improving intestinal absorption of calcium through in vitro studies112. The high degree of calcium absorption in caseins is governed by the sequence flanking the multi-site phosphorylation Ser(P)3-Glu2 motif
84,112

. For example, if the Arg1-Glu4 segment is

removed or inverted with Val8-Glu11, or if the acidic motif is removed, any of these combinations prevents calcium absorption112. Speculation is that the mechanism of
43

binding to the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by electrostatic interaction of the flanking chains of the phosphoserine motif112. The binding properties of -CPP, its ability to form soluble calcium phosphate complexes27 and its resilience against proteolysis113 supports its function as a calcium carrier. About 2.5% of infants under the age of three cannot use the calcium-carrying function of the -CPP peptide as it elicits an allergic response85. The N-terminus region of the calcium carrier peptide is a major epitope for IgE/IgG binding f(1-16) and is known as Bos d 8 in allergen databases85, 114, 115. Subsequent to -CPP binding to the Fab region of the IgE, a cascade of biochemical processes can cause hives in mild cases and anaphylaxis in severe cases86. Of the major antigenic regions of -casein, the N-terminus of -CPP (1-16) is the most frequently-recognized epitope85. Whether the mode of epitope recognition is shape or simply charge complementary, is unknown. The high net charge of -13e, the prevalence of proline, and of glutamic acid residues add to the evidence that -CPP is structurally disordered. Various studies have attempted to elucidate -CPP conformation, using circular dichroism (CD)116,

, sequence-

based prediction methods and molecular modeling techniques116, 123, 124. Table 4.1 is a compilation of proposed secondary structures over the last 30 years for this fragment. Few regions are consistently predicted, but overall there is severe disagreement amongst the various structural studies. Such disagreements in experimental structure determination techniques (CF, CD, Raman, FTIR) arise in large part from the associated difficulties in data processing databases, which are usually based on pre-exisiting globular protein structure characterizations. Such characterizations are not applicable to unfolded proteins
44

or peptides such as -casein or -CPP as they bias proposed conformations towards folded, globular, structures and away from relatively unstable conformations like the polyproline-II-helix (PPII) and extended -strands24. Using NMR for structure determination of IDPs is also complicated due to their dynamics which result in multiple overlapping peaks, deconvolution of which is not always possible 21.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been hailed as the holy grail` of protein structure determination25. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are difficult to study structurally due to their conformational heterogeneity21, which results in multiple degenerate conformational states ­ a characteristic specific for disordered proteins21. As computer simulations are not limited by these experimental constraints, they can provide
45

atomic resolution of IDPs26. Since the first energy minimized structure of cn was published29, numerous simulations have appeared on this protein. Wang et al. (1994) studied the conformation of a peptide of cn f(93-103) to verify the predictions made by Holt & Sawyer in 1993 regarding the presence of a -helix in that region18. Later, Yasar et al. (2006) investigated the conformation of three short peptides of cn predicted to have -helical structure by Kumosinski et al.`s energy minimized model29. By performing multicanonical in vacuo simulation, Yasar et al. showed that the three peptides f(1-6, 35-40, 43-48) exhibited a high probability (>10%) towards forming helices and turns as shown by Kumosinski`s model124. Farrell et al. (2002) also performed a simulation on cn(1-25) to determine the relative mobility of the phosphorylated versus dephosphorylated peptide in an 200ps explicit solvent MD simulation116. Other simulations by Cassiano et al. (2003) determined the critical role of phosphoseryl residues on interfacial properties of cn peptides134. The aim of this work was to determine the structural ensemble of the -CPP peptide through MD simulation to i) verify/eliminate the various secondary structures observed in the literature; ii) understand structure-function correlations and, iii) establish a method for studying small disordered peptides through MD simulation.

4.3 Materials and methods:
4.3.1 Molecular dynamics Set-up The primary sequence of

-CPP

was

obtained

from

DisProt

(RELEELNVPGEIVESLSSSEESITR) from which a PDB file was generated through Pymol (DeLano Scientific; http://www.pymol.org). The structure was modified to add a phosphate groups with a charge of -2e at the known loci of phosphorylation (Amino acids: 15, 17, 18, and 19 from the N-terminus)16, 68. The PDB file was then imported into GROMACS 4.5.1135 using a modified GROMOS 43a force field for phosphoserine groups. This is a united-atom force field that combines non-polar hydrogen atoms onto the bonded adjacent atoms and was parameterized for protein simulations for all 20 common amino acids as well as their phosphorylated derivatives136. Box assignment of dodecahedron at an edge to peptide distance of 1.4nm was used as the simulation box to solvate the protein with 3249 simple point charge (spc) water molecules. The high -13e charge was neutralized with the addition of 20 Na+ and 7 Cl- ions. Excess sodium and chloride ions ensured ~0.1M ionic strength. After energy minimization through steepest descent and conjugate gradient in tandem, in order to prevent bad van der Waal contacts, a 2ps isothermal-isobaric (298K, 1atm) ensemble simulation (V-Rescale temperature coupling and Berendsen isotropic molecule-based-scaling for pressure137) was performed to ensure constant temperature and pressure. Position restraint simulation was also performed for 10ps to allow water to equilibrate to the peptide. For unrestrained simulation the electrostatic interactions were evaluated by Particle-Mesh Ewald method135 with a charge grid spacing of approximately 1.4nm while the Lennard-Jones interactions were evaluated using a 1.4nm cutoff. 135

47

4.3.2 Quality assurance To determine whether the starting structure made a difference on the equilibrium conformations, three different simulation versions each totalling 1.0µs with 0.1ps sampling, were performed. These included one single simulation of 1.0µs, 10 simulations of 0.1µs, and 100 simulations of 0.01µs. The initial starting structure of each simulation was selected from a pool of one thousand different conformations obtained from fifty 10ns NVT simulations conducted at 1000K with sampling every 0.5ns. Equilibrium for each set of simulations (1, 10, or the 100 series) was ensured by zero drift in radius of gyration (Rg) which was assumed to be the structural parameter with the longest equilibration time. The initial portion containing Rg decay was removed to avoid convolution of kinetic changes with equilibrium properties of the system. The simulation trajectories were extended to compensate for the removed kinetic segment. In addition, the lack of interactions between adjacent periodic images (minimum distance always >1.4nm) ensured no contact throughout the simulation, which could have led to nonphysical effects. Finally, the total number of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds; distance between N-H and C=O  0.35nm) was selected as an equilibrium-convergence-metric for conformation. 4.3.3 Simulation analysis The unrestrained simulation was analyzed using the in-built tools provided with GROMACS for Rg, H-bonds, Ramachandran plot, and secondary structure analysis (using DSSP)138. All analyses were based on probability.

plotting radii of gyration from the 100 series over simulation time (Figure 4.1). The radii were initially spread over a range of 0.8-1.6nm, but as they were simulated the range shifted and became smaller 0.75-1.1nm. The initially large spread was due to the high temperature simulation that generated the hundred different structures. Although in reality at temperatures of 1000K, the peptide would break apart, using constrained simulation where bonds do not break and only conformation space is sampled is a common simulation technique to generate different starting structures26.

At high temperatures (1000K in this simulation), the system has enough energy to overcome most conformational barriers present at 298K. As a result, the rugged conformation energy landscape becomes smooth and the conformationally-restrained peptide can diffuse homogeneously in any direction along the radius of gyration energy landscape. As the temperature is lowered back to 298K, the ruggedness of the landscape

49

reappears and each replica falls into a location where it can either stay or slide` down to attain a local energy minimum. As the peptide replicas slide, they adopt an energetically favourable and more compact conformation. Overall, this has the effect of reducing the spread of radii of gyration to 0.75-1.1nm. Monitoring Rg over the simulation trajectory also allows estimation of the ensemble equilibrium relaxation time. Figure 4.1 shows that in the 50ns of simulation time of 100 replica series, after 30ns, the distribution for the radii of gyration, although dynamic, had a constant average and minimal drift. In addition, Figure 4.1b shows the Rg of the 100 replicas over simulation time. At the onset of the 100 replica simulation, the distribution morphology was highly variable. As the simulation proceeded, the ensemble of -CPP moved towards an overall energy minimum and a lognormal-shaped distribution appeared. This occurred after 30ns of simulation time. For all replica series, the initial 30ns were removed and compensated at the end of the simulation. A cumulative simulation time of 1.0s under equilibrium conditions were used for trajectory analysed. 4.4.2 Simulation performance After determination of equilibration time, the next prerequisite of MD simulations prior to analysis was to determine the quality of simulation. This was accomplished by a convergence metric which shows the performance of the simulation. For known disordered peptides like -CPP, where the ultimate goal is to understand the conformation ensemble instead of acquiring convergence to a singular structure, knowing the quality of simulation becomes very important. For the purposes of this work, intramolecular H-bonds were used to as the convergence metric as has been previously shown26. For any peptide of N amino acids and P prolines, the maximum number of
50

hydrogen bonds that can be observed in statistical ensemble can be obtained by the formula:
( ) Eq 4.1

The first N2 term calculates the total permutations, the second term subtracts the diagonal i.e., H-bonds with self, and the third term removes the sterically-improbable H-bonds between adjacent amino acids. Finally ­N×P removes the N-H instances that do not exist on prolines (P). For a graphical picture of H-bond contact map and to understand where this formula comes from, see Figure 4.5. Given that the -CPP contains 25 residues, one of which is a proline, 527 H-bonds can theoretically be sampled by a statistical ensemble of -CPP peptides. For consistency, H-bonds will be represented from acceptor to donor residues (C=ON-H). Figure 4.2 shows the cumulative H-bonds observed during the course of the simulations. The number of H-bonds increases with increasing replicas from 146 to 368 and the highest occurring at 499 H-bonds for

the 100 replica series. About 94.7% of the theoretical numbers of H-bonds were observed with the 100 replica series owing to increased sampling. It is also interesting that even one long simulation is able to sample 27.7% of the total Hbonds. This was highly unexpected, as

51

from the H-bond contact maps (Figure 4.5) the probability of observing many H-bond contacts is low in a singular trajectory. The large number of H-bonds may simply be due to local instead of non-local interactions. Every H-bond interaction takes place between two residues, a donor and an acceptor residue. Each residue has two functional groups and two immediate neighbours. So a non-terminal residue can have eight immediate local interactions, most of which may simply be transient. To sample local H-bonds, the peptide would have to have some degree of mobility, which for -CPP may be provided by intramolecular electrostatic repulsions. The transiency of most local H-bonds is apparent from the sparsely populated contact probability map, but in H-bond (S24  17) local sampling of H-bond can be observed (Figure 4.5A). 4.4.3 Radius of gyration Probabilistic analysis of Rg yielded a bimodal distribution for 1 and 10 replica series and an overall generalized lognormal distribution for 100 replica series. The peak of the 100 series was localized at 0.84nm. For the 1 replica series, two different conformations were observed. The absence of any significant radii of gyration in between the two modalities indicates that the one replica structure is vacillating between two different conformations. These two conformations have been shown in Figure 4.3 as structures A and B. Both structures are primarily stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the positive, terminal Arginine residues the highly negative phosphoseryl residues.

reducing Rg. Though this smaller Rg suggests a more stable peptide structure, this is not likely due to the inherently high charge. This is one reason why in the 100 replica series, the structures with low Rg values had a low probability region from 0.75-0.80nm. Having a small Rg for -CPP would require precise hydrogen and electrostatic bonding

structure. Since the precise electrostatic bonding structure can be formed by only a few stable structures, it is thus not a favourable -CPP conformation relative to the ensemble, due to tight packing of negatively charged residues. However, for the 1 replica simulation, the tightly packed structure Figure 4.3A was significantly more stable than the larger structure Figure 4.3B as shown by the probability distribution. The 100 replica Rg probability peaks at 0.84nm before tapering at higher Rg (Figure 4.3). The smooth reduction in Rg population at the other extreme could be rationalized the opposite way. If a peptide were to have a large Rg, due to the charges as well as potential to form

53

hydrogen bonds present the system would favour formation of smaller sized structures. As a result, after the initial compact structural conformation, the increase in size is a continuum which corresponds to a rapidly decreasing population. The sum of all replicas tended towards asymmetric normal distributions, as already observed for IDPs21, 26. These results strongly suggested that for -CPP peptide, there are multiple, degenerate energy minima in which the peptide can exist. The most probable Rg of 0.87nm was compared with bioinformatics data analysis of 1000 globular proteins in the PDB database, using the following relationship between the number of amino acids (N) and their corresponding Rg: 139:

Eq 4.2

This equation, when used for -CPP peptide predicts an Rg value of 1.0±0.07nm, assuming the peptide is in a globular state, which, unfortunately is an overestimation even considering the error of regression. An enhanced sampling simulation of an IDP of 35 amino acids peptide (GVPGV)7 in the literature exhibited a smaller Rg located at ~0.79nm. Although the peptide was larger, the lack of negative residues presumably allowed closer packing and a reduced Rg compared to -CPP. A very detailed SAXS and SANS study by Holt et al. 1998 measured the Rg of the -CPP peptide when complexed with calcium phosphate. Through model calculations, it was discovered that the Rg of CPP in the complexed state was 1.85±0.05nm140. However, the Rg plot from the simulation indicated a very low probability for any value above 1.1nm. If this were found to be the case in a similar set of simulations of -CPP with Ca2+ ions present, it would indicate an open conformation that occurs upon complexation of the

54

peptide with calcium phosphate. The open conformation may act as a brush that increases the local entropy to prevent further growth of the nanoclusters similar to the role of casein in maintaining steric stability to casein micelles17,
66, 71, 141

. Given a sufficient

concentration of the peptide relative to CaHPO4, it would also prevent mineral conjugation with other nanoclusters through steric repulsion. The mechanism governing the conformation change could simply be charge neutralization of phosphoseryl groups by the calcium phosphate salt which would displace the amino acids formally interacting with SerP, to allow their association with water and other ions in solution.

4.4.4 Hydrogen Bonding Hydrogen bonds in proteins are very important as they are involved with structural integrity of proteins143. The protein backbone is made from a series of peptide bonds between adjacent residues that determine the primary
C B A

sequence of a protein. Peptide bonds form by a dehydration reaction between a carboxylic acid on the first, and a primary amine on the second, amino acid (Figure 4.4A)142. The peptide bond that forms has a partial double bond character as the electronegative oxygen can pull electron density from the

nitrogen through its connected carbon (Figure 4.4B)143. As a result, the amido group atoms H-N-C-O of the peptide bond all lie in the same plane (Figure 4.4C). The double bond character of the peptide bond has a marked effect on rigidity of the polypeptide chain and consequently on the folding of the polypeptide chain as well142. Rotations are only allowed between C-N ( angle) and C-C(O) () angle (Figure 4.4D). Plots of C-N ( angle) vs. C-C(O) () angles are known as Ramachandran plots and can give insights into the propensity of angles toward a particular secondary structure. The peptide backbone can participate in hydrogen bond formation, which occurs as a result of donation of electrons from the carboxyl group (C=O) to the amino group (N-H)21, 142. Figure 4.5 shows acceptor atoms (C=O) on the x-axis and donor atoms (N-H) on the yaxis of the same individual residue. The residues are shown from the NC terminus. The plot was discretized into indices corresponding to each donor and acceptor residues. Along the trajectory, the number of times each index was encountered, it was tabulated. At the end of the simulation, the number of H-bonds in each index was normalized to the total number of H-bonds to obtain the probability map. Recall that for H-bonds plot the center diagonal, the adjacent residues, and the N-H groups of prolines are removed. There is asymmetry in the plot along the diagonal because the two axes correspond to two different groups of atoms on each residue (N-H, C=O). The top left side of the map from the diagonal is dedicated for N-H group interactions with C=O on the peptide backbone whereas the lower right side is dedicated to C=O and their interactions with N-H groups. Furthermore, most hydrogen bonding interactions have directionality. Mathematically this translates into the donor residue number almost always being larger than the acceptor

56

residue. When the donor residue number is smaller, it leads to rare secondary structures that are known as right-handed (e.g., right-handed helix).144 The first notable feature in all H-bond contact maps is that the maximum probability of each map is different as noted on the colour bar. With increasing number of replicas, the maximum probability decreases from 0.0587 to 0.0252. As a result, multiple replicas approach the statistical ensemble and sample a greater range of the conformation space. Due to multiple starting conformations, the population of H-bonds sampled greatly increases and lights up` different areas of the contact map. As a result, the H-bond contact probability spreads over several contacts instead of being restricted to one set of contacts due to an energy barrier. The most favourable contact has an overall reduced probability which is more representative of the ensemble. This does not limit the analysis as the contact map with reduced peak probability can be scaled to the maximum probability to show areas that have been sampled during the simulation trajectory. One important observation common to all contact maps is the presence of the third diagonal from the centre towards the donor N-H groups. This diagonal is heavily populated with the highest probability contacts between i (C=O) and i+3 (N-H) residues. According to Table 4.2, this type of H-bonding refers to 310-helix. These helices are rare due to their tight angular requirements. It is likely that the simple H-bonding definition (0.35nm cutoff between donor N-H and residue C=O) overestimates the number of Hbonds. In order to obtain the best measure of H-bonds the definition would allow for 30o along the N-H--O bonds, a 0.25nm H to O distance, and 0.35nm N to C distance cutoff135. Therefore to improve upon this work, the ideal definition has to be taken into account.
57

Even with overestimation of H-bonds, there are some reasonable conclusions that can be deduced based on the 100 replica simulation shown in Figure 4.5C. There are three regions of very high contact probability along the backbone (E5N7, L6V8; E11V13; E21I23, I23R25). Usually this type of a pattern denotes the presence of turns145-147. Another implication of this result is that local interactions along the backbone of the -CPP are highly favoured rather than non-local interactions most likely due to the presence of charges along the backbone of the peptide. Due to increased sampling, two important features appear in the contact map of the 100 replica series. First, the N-H side of the map is more populated than C=O side, signifying a higher degree of H-bond interactions for N-H than their neighbouring carboxyl (C=O) counterpart. As mentioned before this is due to directionality of H-bonds144. Second, the regions of high negative charge from residue 1-14 and residues 15-19 have a low probability of interaction because of electrostatic repulsion.

4.4.5 Secondary Structure Some studies have emphasized the presence of secondary structure in  -CPP peptide localized in particular residues116 while others have hypothesized that the peptide maintains an overall worm-like conformation defined as rheomorphic where local structure may exist, but it is not localized to a series of residues24. This is where the DSSP probability plot (Figure 4.6) becomes very useful as it can isolate secondary structures during the simulation along with visualization of their drift. The DSSP algorithm takes into account hydrogen bonds as a primary and rotation angle as a secondary measure for structure assignment. The elementary units of higher order structures are turns` and bridges`. Repeating turns develop into helices while repeating bridges become ladders` (commonly known as extended structure), and repeating conjugated ladders form sheets`. Regions of high curvature without hydrogen bonding are classified as bends`. Lastly, a catchall term for every other geometry is called a loop`138, 138. Table 4.2 identifies the eight different secondary structures identified by the DSSP software along with their mechanism of formation, and simplified molecular structure. Similar to the H-bond analysis, increasing the number of replicas from 1 to a 100 increases the quality of the results (Figure 4.5). Each structure observed in DSSP plot does not occur by virtue of one residue. For the purposes of generating the plot, the secondary structure each amino acid residue experiences during the simulation, was isolated and the probability was calculated based on the number of times it was observed in the simulation trajectory.

As an example, glycine (G10) was found in a loop structure 70% of the time, 25% of the time in a bend, ~4% in an extended structure and 1% in a turn or a -bridge. So the colour coding of the plot corresponds to that probability which shows yellow colour

The colour and intensity, which is based on the rainbow lookup table, indicates the probability of SS occurrence for an individual residue. The abbreviations on the y-axis are for DSSP structure characterisation and should not be confused with the one-letter amino acid Figure 4.6 Secondary structure (SS) probability plot abbreviations on the x-axis.

replica series shows sparsely-distributed probabilities with little agreement between the neighbouring residues. So for simplicity, only the 100 replica series will be discussed. Secondary structure 310 helix has very low probability of occurrence during the simulation irrespective of amino acid residue. Other structures, like ,  helices and bridges also exist at low probabilities for most residues. Low probabilities can be observed for -sheets while most residues are involved in turns, bends and loop type structures.

61

4.4.5.1 Helix: There is very low probability of forming  and  helices in the various amino acid residues. Helices require turns as a prerequisite. Although all amino acids, excepting termini, are at some point involved in turns, these turns do not necessarily become helices. The main reason for this can be associated with the high degree of charge along the polypeptide chain. Formation of a helix results in a reduced Rg of the involved residues148, which is not possible in the case of -CPP due to electrostatic repulsions. This also explains why more residues are involved in -helix which requires a longer 5turn prerequisite and therefore would have a larger Rg of the involved residues. Larger Rg, would lower the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion. Experimental evidence for helical structural comes from three different studies. The first two studies used CD as well as many sequence-based prediction algorithms based on globular protein analysis to identify helical structures in this sequence68,
131

. The identified residues involved in

helical structure were E2-E5 and 19-R25. The third study, conducted by Chaplin et al. in 1988117, isolated the fragments involved and used CD to detect helix formation.

Although, in aqueous solutions, helices were not detected, upon addition of >40% 2,2,2trifluoroethanol, helices were observed in the spectra117 for both regions. So, although the potential existed, the probability was low. This correlates very well to the secondary structure probability plot where E2-E5 and 19-R25 regions are involved in  and  helices. Both regions also exhibit low probabilities of helix formation. 4.4.5.2 -Structure (Bridges, Ladders, and Sheets) There are four sets of residues that appear to participate in -sheet formation with moderate probability (G10, E14, 19, and S22). The low probability of bridges, which precede -sheets, is however, surprising. This may be due to the fact that once a bridge is
62

formed it initiates the formation of the sheet, which would be stable for a longer period of time than a singular bridge as a result of multiple H-bonds. 4.4.5.3 Loops: Loops are conformationally the most mobile secondary structures due to the lack of Hbonds and any restricted angle constraints. The N and C terminus arginine residues exist as loops because every secondary structure calculation is based on angles and hydrogen bonding patterns of flanking residues. This is an inherent property of terminal residues144. Furthermore, these termini have been associated with loops in NMR analysis of the CPP peptide28. Glycine (G10) and glutamic acid (E11) are also associated with loop-type structures with highest probability. The small size of glycine (which allows greater conformational flexibility) could be responsible for its presence in a loop. By association with a conformationally flexible neighbour, glutamic acid is also part of loop type structure. 18 and 19 also have a high probability of existing in loop-type structures. 4.4.5.4 Bends: The highest likelihood for all residues within the 3-24 window is their presence in bendtype secondary structures. The absence of characterization for the first and second residues from the N and C termini is due to the inherent property of bends that requires the two amino acids on each side of the residue of interest, in order to perform the calculation. The classification criterion of turns is the presence of a hydrogen bond between C=O (i) and N-H (i+n), where i is the residue location and n=2,3,4,5 (, , , ). In addition, a 3-turn can take up various other dihedrals which have very high rotation angles138. A bend on the other hand is classified simply by the sum of three backbone rotation angles >70° and a C(i) to C(i+3) distance of <7Å138. The difference between a turn and a bend is in the presence or absence of a hydrogen bond, respectively. So it is
63

not surprising that in regions with a high likelihood of turns, there is also the presence of bends (Figure 4.6). 4.4.5.5 Turns: As predicted from the H-bond probability map, there are three clusters of residues that can exist as turns; E2-P9, E11-18 and 19-T24. This does not indicate the connectivity, but rather the range of amino acids possibly involved in turns. Based on H-bond probability plot, L3-E5, E11-V13, 18, V14-L16 and E20-S22 appear to be involved in turns. The lack of turn probability at glycine G10 is in agreement with literature simulations on proline and glycine-rich peptides149. It has been found that glycine content is anti-correlated to turn formation in peptides149. This is because high glycine content increases the entropic cost of constraining the backbone in the formation of turns149. Naturally, this is aggravated by proline (P9) that neighbours the glycine (G10) residue on -CPP and has also been found to be anti-correlated with formation of turns and -sheets. This anti-correlation with turns has the effect of increasing the hydration of the peptide backbone due to the allowable conformational movement149. Experimentally, only the V8-E11 turn has been consistently predicted from Chou-Fasman algorithms132, 133 as well as NMR150. Although the potential of forming a turn is there, the probability of glycine (G10) existing in a turn-type structure is greatly reduced. This is contradictory to the conclusions set forth by Cross et al (2005)28, but in line with the conclusions of Tsuda et al in 1991118. In both studies, the d chemical shift between P9 to E11 (which would have ensured the presence of a turn sequence), was absent. However, the neighbouring residues had the potential to form turns. So, although the results were similar, the authors` conclusions were different. The reason for Cross et al. (2001) to

64

classify this region as a turn was because of other peaks associated with P9 and E11 which suggested distance of less than 0.5nm. This does not necessarily mean that there is a Hbond mediated stabilization when it could also be a bend type structure. In addition Cross et al. (2001) also suggested that turn regions included 17-E20, and E21-T24. The simulation suggests otherwise and coincidentally, relative to turn probabilities, both of these regions are consistently associated with high probabilities of bends and loop-type structures (Figure 4.6), which lends to the difficulty in associating structural features with NMR chemical shifts.

4.4.6 Ramachandran Angles The DSSP probability plot shows the existence of secondary structure. However, one structure that is not classified, but has been known to exist in -CPP, is the PPII structure116. Structural characterization of PII structure is based on dihedral angles in the region around   .

Recall that plotting  and  angles results in a distribution plot which can indicate propensity of angles. This can be

correlated to various types of secondary structures. Simulation of phosphorylated serine groups indicates presence of some torsion angles to the left of the helix region (G, H and I in Figure 4.7).

structure analysis (Figure 4.6) shows that these angles are indicative only of the propensity of the 23 dihedral angles in the peptide. This means that there are forces that
66

may prevent peptidic domains from folding into the appropriate secondary structures. This is not surprising as there are a number of Glutamic acid residues in the peptide composition, which is the second most structure-dissolving amino acid in the DisProt database21. In addition, this is aggravated by the presence of proline whose cyclic structure rigidifies the  portion of its dihedral preventing formation of secondary structure elements154. Although -CPP contains only one proline, the highest region frequented in the Ramachandran plot is the region around   . This region

is associated with the PPII structure, which exists in certain peptides even when there is a paucity of prolines. With higher number of replicas, the only main difference in the plots is that the population of angles corresponding to PPII helices are increased. Another important set of Ramachandran angles observed are the angles to the left of the helix region. This region has been observed specifically for phosphoserine residues in simulations152, 153. Interestingly, increasing the replica number did not have a significant impact on the contours of the Ramachandran plot as compared to H-bonds and DSSP probability plot. With even one long simulation, it was possible to determine the contours of the dihedral angles in the plot. This has two important implications for simulation methodology. First, Ramachandran plots cannot be used to as quality control measures or to determine the performance of simulation as the angles populated with 1, 10 or a 100 replica series are generally the same. Second, these plots are useful only to determine propensity of angles, but not definite structures. Third, the local angle population of a few replicas is representative of the conformational ensemble.

67

Experimental cross-validation with Raman Optical Activity (ROA) of -casein indicated two populations of dihedral angles. The more favoured population is that of the PPII structure, while the minor population was of a more extended, but hydrated, peptide bonds that mitigated the possible presence of -sheets22. Since the ROA study was conducted with -casein, an exact comparison is not present, although some similarities can be seen in the Ramachandran plot. The dihedral populations that appear in the highest density were of the PPII structure as per ROA analysis22. However, unlike ROA, the simulation showed a lower propensity towards -helix type dihedrals. It is possible that the lower probability of this population of dihedrals prevented its detection in the ROA spectrum. A qualitative NMR study on conformation of -CPP in a variety of solutions showed that in the case where the peptide was neutralized by NaCl ions, there was a propensity towards -turns as well as -helical angles on the Ramachandran plot28. The most recent CD evidence also suggests low level of -helix (5%), and high levels of -structure and turns (34, 28%)116. Hence, the simulation is in qualitative agreement with experimental studies conducted thus far. 4.4.7 Working Hypothesis for interaction with calcium and phosphate ions Combination of all data for Rg, H-bond, secondary structure as well as Ramachandran plot alludes to a mechanism related to the function of -CPP. In the presence of calcium and phosphate ions, -CPP forms nanoclusters with very precise Rg (2.80±0.05nm) (10mg/mL with 37mM of Ca2+ and 30mM of PO43- ions)140. The mechanism of such a controlled Rg is currently unknown other than the fact that it is associated with the disorder of the peptide20, 155. On its own, the peptide exhibits a distribution of Rg ranging

68

from 0.75-1.1nm with most conformations at 0.84nm. When complexed with Ca2+ and PO43- ions, the terminal arginines are displaced to give way to binding to the phosphoseryl cluster. Consequently, the size of the peptide would increase when in the form of a complexed peptide, as has been observed with SAXS and SANS data155. As a result, these terminal arginines become involved with residues prior to the phosphorylated motif. In addition, there is a significant amount of conformational flexibility at glycine G10 by virtue of its presence in a loop. Thus, the hypothesized mechanism of binding of -CPP to Ca2+ is as follows: Ca2+ and PO43- would bind to the phosphoseryl residues at residues 15-19. The mineralization would grow as a result of nucleation. To limit nucleation, the size of the calcium phosphate nanocluster would be mitigated by the conformational flexibility offered by glycine at G10. The flexibility would be exhibited by the N-terminus arm of the peptide, which would increase local entropy and prevent binding. The N-terminus arginine would bind electrostatically with amino acids prior to the phosphorylated motif, which would limit binding of Ca2+ and PO43- ions to only the phophoseryl residues. This would allow the peptide to stabilize the colloid in aqueous solutions. As this is a working hypothesis, in order to obtain a complete picture there are two important future studies that must be conducted. First, a simulation of the peptide in presence of calcium and phosphate ions to characterize such structural features must be conducted. A second simulation of multiple peptides in the presence of calcium and phosphate ions to determine the structure of the calcium phosphate nanocluster bound to -CPPs is also necessary.

69

4.5 Conclusions
A molecular dynamics simulation method to determine casein structure was devised. The method was tested with -CPP and yielded qualitative agreement with existing experiment results. Radius of gyration ranged from 0.75-1.1nm. H-bond analysis indicated highest probability for local bonds 3 residues apart rather than longer range interactions. The secondary structure is in agreement with experimental as well as simulation studies conducted so far. Ramachandran plot showed four major populations of dihedral angles including PPII angles as well as angles from phosphoserine residues, in qualitative agreement with ROA, NMR, and simulation data. Most individual amino acids have preference towards bends which precede turns, except for glycine. The conformational flexibility of glycine allows for a loop-type structure. It is hypothesized that the conformational flexibility of glycine prevents mineral growth after sequestration due to local entropy. This can be tested with future simulations of the peptide in presence of calcium and phosphate ions. 4.5.1 Future Directions Knowing the conformation ensemble of -CPP can allow understanding of calcium phosphate sequestration phenomena as well as how the peptide can increase the bioavailability of calcium phosphate. As NMR spectral changes have been observed in the polypeptide upon addition of calcium ions, conformational studies of -CPP under different physicochemical conditions could help identify the exact mechanism of controlling the size of the amorphous calcium phosphate nanocluster. As the peptide is involved with increasing the bioavailability of calcium, simulation studies with lipid bilayers could provide atomic scale resolution on the phenomena. Another important

aspect that could be studied in detail is atomic scale interaction of the Fab region of IgE. This could identify structural components required for recognition. Finally, since an MD method has been developed and validated with experimental results, it is possible to test the method with other important regions of the casein micelle which may be involved with VD3 binding ­ the original goal of the thesis.

Chapter 5: Overall Remarks
The development of a simple binding assay now affords the ability to study interactions between macromolecules and vitamin D3. In terms of the initial goal of understanding the interaction of vitamin D3 with casein, this was an important milestone. With future optimization of VD3 ­ casein binding interaction as well as the reliable carryover of VD3 from milk to cheese, it is easy to foresee that the technology of VD3 fortified cheese using casein will come to fruition within 5-10 years. Regarding the molecular understanding of casein and VD3, the end appears far. However, by performing simulations of a single casein peptide, the stage has been set for future determination of -casein and casein micelle structure. Simplification of the simulation problems may be required to obtain the statistical ensemble quickly and efficiently. Once the structure of casein micelle is understood, docking simulations with VD3 would bridge the gap in understanding between binding interaction and localization of VD3 inside the casein micelle. Overall, although there is a lot to be done in order to understand the interaction of casein with VD3, what this thesis has done is lay the foundation.
