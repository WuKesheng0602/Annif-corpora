ABSTRACT Photographic Retouching: The Press Picture Editor's "Invisible" Tool, 1930-1939; A Study of Retouched Press Prints from the Art Gallery of Ontario's British Press Agencies Collection Master of Arts 2010 Rachel Verbin Photographic Preservation and Collections Management Ryerson University and the Art Gallery of Ontario

Photographic Retouching investigates the mediatory work of the news picture editor during the 1930s. It considers what retouched press photographs add to the history of modern photojournalism, and offers a re-examination of the historiography of 1930s press photography. A descriptive analysis of sixteen representative, retouched photographs from the Art Gallery of Ontario's (AGO) British Press Agencies Collection (BPAC) and ten corresponding newspaper and magazine page spreads from the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Dispatch and Life is carried out in conjuncture with press photography manuals published between the years 1930 and 1939. A literature survey, methodology section and description of the BPAC provide introductory contextual and historical information. Chapters 4 and 5, the main analytical sections, focus on two aspects of retouching: the technical difficulties that afflicted press photography during the 1930s and how retouching was employed as a corrective tool; and the ways in which retouching was utilized to strengthen and improve upon the photograph's ability to consistently convey a clear and visually efficient narrative for use by the press.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My sincerest thanks to my first reader, Professor Thierry Gervais, for being so generous with his time and knowledge throughout the course of this thesis. This thesis would not have developed from a set of questions and ideas into an analytical paper without Professor Gervais having taught me not only about the history of photography but how to question and use both information and photographic objects as sources and research tools. Thank you very much to my second reader, Professor David Harris, for leading the thesis class and for helping my research and analysis to develop. Thank you as well to curators Sophie Hackett and Maia-Marie Sutnik at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) for being so willing to share the AGO's Photography Collection with us this year. Special thanks to PPCM faculty Professors Marta Braun, Robert Burley, Vid Ingelevics and Mike Robinson, and to Peter Higdon and Doina Popescu at the Ryerson Gallery and Research Centre for enriching my experience in the PPCM Program. Thank you to all of my fellow classmates and colleagues. Special thanks to Emily McKibbon for her research assistance at the George Eastman House Library and to Sara Keane for her research assistance at the British Library. Thank you to D'Arcy White and Paul Sergeant for couriering books from the U.S. into Canada for me. My warmest thanks are of course extended to my family and to Noah for being so supportive throughout this process. Lastly, I would also like to thank Jennifer Gilchrist, who copy edited the third draft of this thesis.

INTRODUCTION Photographs taken for the press during the 1930s are generally heralded as

representative of an innovative period, which earmarks this decade as the beginnings of modern photojournalism.1 Established during the 1930s, American pictorial magazines Life (est. 1936) and Look (est. 1937), and their British counterpart the Picture Post (est. 1938), placed the photograph front and centre as a primary news medium;2 newspapers followed suit and, thus, there emerged a vast network of photographic agencies and the professionalized, modernized press photographer.3 Stars of international repute, this "new generation of photo reporters"4 included Margaret Bourke-White, Erich Salomon, Alfred Eisenstaedt, BrassaÃ¯ and Robert Capa,5 who was famously championed as "The Greatest War Photographer in the World" by the Picture Post in 1938.6 Photographs such as Capa's Death of a Loyalist Militiaman (1936) and Bourke-White's Fort-Peck Dam, Montana (1936) have since been written into the canon of photographic history, surpassing the ephemeral life of the vernacular news media. The myriad technical achievements made to press photography during the 1930s are generally used to explain how photojournalism was developed in its modern form on

The terms "photojournalism" and "press photography" will be used to describe photographs taken for and published by the press.   2 Naomi Rosenblum, A World History of Photography, 3rd ed. (New York: Abbeville Press, 1997), 475.; Life, Look and the Picture Post adopted a style, which is said to have begun in Germany during the 1920s, with magazines such as the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung (BIZ) and the Munchner Illustrierte Zeitung (MIP).

the pages of magazines such as Life and the Picture Post.7 While developments in camera, film and speedflash technology gave photographers increased flexibility, precision and freedom while shooting, improvements to the halftone process meant superior reproductions in print; new printing techniques, moreover, allowed for faster press runs. In 1935, The Associated Press Wirephoto network began transmitting images across the globe within minutes.8 Ever more willing and able to publish and promote photographs as an accurate form of visual information, magazine and newspaper editors looked to the photojournalist to provide their publications with an increasing amount of news coverage.9 To distinguish itself as a magazine that "treated pictures with reverence,"10 Life reportedly established a policy against extensive photographic retouching within its first few years of publication. As explained by former executive editor of Life, Wilson Hicks, in his 1952 manual Words and Pictures: An Introduction to Photojournalism: During its experimental period,11 Life enunciated for itself and adopted as part of its working philosophy the principle that the photographs should not be retouched except in the rarest circumstances. The day of the intervention of drawing between camera reporter and reader was over, yet most newspapers and some other magazines, primarily for mechanical but also for "artistic" reasons, had carried retouching to a point where, in many instances, the printed picture was a combination of a photograph and hand "art" work [...] When Life took this stand it rendered a great service to the photograph as a communicative medium.12

Although this quotation refers to a policy outlined by Life, an American weekly, Hicks' words are applicable on a larger scale.13 While a distinction may be made between the American and European presses, and between newspapers and magazines, if one considers that agencies were sending photographs across the globe to dailies and weeklies alike -- for example, Czechoslovakia's training in national defense (BPAC Print 526, Paul Popper, 1938) was date stamped by the Sunday Dispatch and published in Life (fig. 21-23) -- one can read Hicks' quotation as a symptom of a generally held idealization of 1930s photojournalism as it traversed both the ocean and the various streams of the press. Thus, one can interpret Hicks' text in two ways. Firstly, underlying this noble history of modern press photography was the continuation of a contentious technical practice, now out of sorts with the grandeur of this enterprise, as exemplified by Life. Secondly, the quotation suggests that Life made this editorial decision as a way to separate itself from other publications, thus reaffirming that the retouching of press photographs was indeed common practice at that time. Sixteen retouched 1930s press photographs were selected from the Art Gallery of Ontario's (AGO) British Press Agencies Collection (BPAC), an archive of 1,240 press photographs that features 680 prints from the 1930s; of the 139 works in the entire collection that are retouched, 97 (69.8 percent) date to this particular decade.14 As such, it is important to consider what a study of these objects can add to the history of 1930s press photography and, specifically, what do these retouched photographs tell us about the work of the picture editor during that period? These 16 BPAC prints are copyright stamped by The Associated Press, the Daily Mail, Alfieri Picture Service, Keystone View Company, Planet News Ltd., The Topical

However, these publications do not refer to Hick's passage about Life's anti retouching policy. 14 The BPAC will be described in more detail in the Methodology chapter of this thesis.

Press Agency Ltd., Wide World Photos and the Graphic Photo Union, with only a single print credited to an author: Paul Popper. Twelve prints (86, 109, 189, 200, 201, 242, 243, 315, 322, 399, 441 and 627) are date stamped by the Daily Mirror, a British illustrated daily published from 1903 to the present; and four prints (109, 526, 527 and 579) are date stamped by the Sunday Dispatch, a British Sunday paper published from 1928 to 1961. The agency stamps, publication date stamps and cutlines present on the versos confirm that these objects are press prints; their overall creases, folds, staining and surface soil also document their use by this industry. They were taken in Czechoslovakia, England, Germany, Spain and the United States and feature a range of subject matter, including war, sports, human interest and world news. The photographs exhibit retouching applications that vary from light to heavy, applied to improve both copy15 and news values. These representative images were selected for what they reveal about the picture editor's position as a powerful mediator between press photograph and pictorial news. Because of the importance of this role, I have devoted two central chapters to this discussion: "Production/Reproduction: Retouching to Improve Copy Value" and "Illustration/Narration: Retouching to Improve News Value." As interventions that went beyond cropping and sequencing, retouching applications provide researchers today with new avenues of analysis with regard to the treatment and uses of news photographs during the 1930s. However, because scholars have, in general, concentrated on the subject matter of 1930s press photographs rather than the entire photographic object, they have not investigated the role of retouching, and, as a result, this practice has been largely written out of the history of photojournalism. The literature survey confirmed that academic interest in 1930s press photography is underscored by concerns with technical progress,

"Good copy is that which has (1) sharp focus; (2) good detail; (3) contrast in tones." According to Laura Vitray, John Mills, Jr., and Roscoe Ellard in their manual, Pictorial Journalism (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1939), 45.

the establishment of pictorial magazines and the starring roles of the photojournalist and news photograph. In contrast, press photography manuals published during the 1930s address retouching practices in depth, within an editorial context. In the following paper, readers will find a literature survey, which provides an overview of studies previously carried out about photojournalism and photographic retouching, a description of the BPAC and an explanation of the methodology undertaken to select a group of prints relevant for analysis in the main part of the essay. By considering these prints as technical and illustrative agents and tools, this thesis utilizes photographic objects, newspaper pages and press photography manuals to reexamine the historiography of 1930s photojournalism through the lens of the news picture editor, a post that oversaw and directed the retouching work done to news photographs during that decade.

LITERATURE SURVEY This literature survey included analytical, historical and technical texts

about photographic retouching as practiced by the press during the 1930s. It begins with a review of general history of photography books and books on the history of journalism and photojournalism, followed by a survey of academic journal articles that examine the history of photographic retouching.16 The survey concludes with a brief review of technical manuals published between the years 1930 to 1952. However, as the 1930s manuals will be utilized as primary sources, they will not be analyzed in this survey at length. Rather, they have been listed and briefly overviewed.

History of Photography, Photojournalism and Journalism Publications In the chapter "Portraits for the Million" in Beaumont Newhall's 1982

edition of The History of Photography: From 1839 to the Present, one learns that the inclusion by German photographer Franz Hanfstaengl of a retouched negative and two prints -- one before the negative was retouched and one after retouching -- at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris was cited by the nineteenth century French portrait photographer, Nadar, as "the beginning of a new era in photography."17 As sitters began to demand the removal of facial blemishes and wrinkles, retouching became customary in nineteenth century portrait studios.18 However, additional references to retouching found within this publication in writings about fine art, travel and scientific photography are little more than citations.

This latter text simply cites retouching techniques applied to press prints during the 1920s and 1930s as one of several "precise instructions"22 passed on from editors to graphic artists and retouching specialists. Mary Warner Marien's 2006 publication Photography: A Cultural History23 includes several brief references to photographic retouching in connection with the practices of studio portraiture in the chapter "The Second Invention of Photography (1893-1854)."24 Similarly, Marien's acknowledgement of retouching techniques as used by the press during the 1880s and 1890s is found in the chapter "Photography in the Modern Age (1880-1918)" and is only a single sentence: "The images were routinely

Marta Braun's essay, "Aux limites du savoir: 1845-1900; la photographie et les sciences de l'observation," uses retouched nineteenth century scientific photographs as objects to raise questions concerning previously held beliefs about the relationship between science and photography in the nineteenth century. Braun's analysis of pre-1880s retouched scientific photographs reveals that while photography was championed from the onset as a tool that could accurately depict nature, and thus would serve science better than the illustrator's interpretive drawings, its earliest technologies required heavy retouching and as such were unable to provide unmediated records.28 "Les formes de l'information: 1843-2002; de la presse illustrÃ©e aux mÃ©dias modernes" by Thierry Gervais and GaÃ«lle Morel,29 also published in L'art de la

photographie, surveys the uses of photography by the press from the mid-nineteenth century through to the beginning of the twenty-first century. Gervais and Morel address the gradual incorporation of photography by the print media -- a history which in France can be traced to 1843 and the publication of an illustrated view of the Fort Saint-Jean d'Ullos, Veracruz in L'Illustration along with a note specifying: "from a view taken by a daguerreotype."30 Reexamining the process through which photography and the press became partners, the authors address the extensive mediatory handwork and experimental publication processes used during the later half of the nineteenth century to reproduce photographs in newsprint. Retouching and montage, used in combination with the coated wood technique, for example, reveal that the nineteenth century print media utilized photographs primarily as time saving devices. In contrast to most histories, which tend to assume that the halftone process immediately superseded wood engraving methods, this complex, transitional -- and non-linear -- historical relationship between photography and the press was not instantaneously overturned by the commercialization of the halftone process during the 1890s, but continued into the twentieth century. Although photographic retouching as employed by the press during the 1930s is not addressed in "Les formes de l'information," the chapter offers analysis of the exponential growth in the illustrated news magazine market, the innovative layouts made with photographs in magazines such as Vu, the emergence of the photographic agency and the development of the Wirephoto network during this decade. The photojournalist's transformation during the modern period into "special envoy"31 and "auteur"32 is also discussed.33 Thus, the chapters by Braun and Gervais and Morel in L'art de la photographie exemplify a new

scholarly approach, which views photographic retouching as a practice, which provides new paths of historical analyses. On the other hand, a review of books about twentieth century press photography indicates that such publications have focused on the technical and professional advances made to modern photojournalism. Retouching techniques and the role of the picture editor are not of primary concern to these studies. "Design" by Allen Hutt, published in 1971 in Scoop, Scandal and Strife: A Study of Photography in Newspapers,34 lists "careful retouching of the prints"35 as an important step in the Daily Mirror's production process during the early twentieth century but does not carry this discussion into the modern period. Tim Gidal's Modern Photojournalism: Origin and Evolution, 1910-1933 (1973) studies improvements made to camera equipment, the emergence of illustrated magazines, photojournalists and news agencies but does not address retouching.36 Former Sunday Times editor Harold Evans' Pictures on a Page (1982) examines the effects of editorial selection, cropping and enlarging.37 Retouching techniques are included in a short instructional paragraph that acknowledges the practice, but does not engage in subsequent analysis.38 Moreover, by referencing the unfaithful reproduction of daguerreotypes published as engravings in the illustrated press during the mid-nineteenth century, Robert Lebeck and Bodo Von Dewitz's 2001 book Kiosk once again situates photographic retouching as an historic practice. The Kiosk chapters that focus on the

1930s are concerned with propaganda and wartime reporting, and although Lebeck and Von Dewitz analyze the use of photomontage as a layout style during 1930s, they do not address the picture editor's employment of retouching techniques during that decade.39 In the introduction to Looking at Life Magazine (2001), Erika Doss cites the photographic medium as "manipulation of light and chemicals."40 Although Life's editors, including Wilson Hicks, "who held the authoritative hand over Life's pictorial aesthetic from 1937 to 1950,"41 are criticized for their manipulation of visual news through sequencing, framing and editing, Doss does not address retouching specifically.42 As such, while books about twentieth century photojournalism do acknowledge that photographic retouching existed within this field, they do not provide an analytical history of this facet of the picture editor's work. Similarly, books about contemporary journalism are eager to critique the manipulation of digital photographs, but tend to approach retouching's analogue lineage only briefly. The chapter "Old-Fashioned Fakery" in Tom Wheeler's 2002 book Photographic Truth or Photofiction: Ethics and Media Imagery in the Digital Age may not be extensive in its analysis of this history, but it nevertheless affirms that such a history exists. For example, Wheeler refers to Life's 1930s policy against extensive retouching. However, he does not provide specifics about this policy, nor does he cite its original publication date or context.43 Pulling Newspapers Apart: Analyzing Print

Journalism44 (2008) also contains points of relevant information -- again within the context of contemporary digital media. For example, in the chapter "The Veracity of Photographs," Eamonn McCabe (a former picture editor at the Guardian) writes: "Long gone are the days when you could squeeze a three-column football picture into two columns by moving the ball."45 In this regard, these publications tend to use the history of retouching as a pathway into current debates that center on digital photojournalism and that raise questions about computer-based photographic editing. Thus, the history of photography surveys and books about journalism and photojournalism reviewed in this section suggest that until recently, as the popularization of digital technology has increased, the technical and professional advances associated with modern press photography have, in general, been the focus of such publications. However, texts such as "Aux limites du savoir" and "Les formes de l'information," which use retouched photographs as objects to raise questions about the standard histories of photography -- including those of the press -- suggest and exemplify a new approach, which offers a more complex set of historical narratives.

2.b

Academic Texts A survey of academic journals was also conducted to determine how

scholars have addressed retouching practices within the history of photography. Several recent articles reaffirm a growing interest in this topic and, moreover, provide insight into why this facet of photography's history has not previously been extensively researched.

The 1989 anthology, La Photographie en France: textes et controverses: une anthologie 1816-1871, edited by AndrÃ© RouillÃ©, includes a section entitled "Pour ou contre la retouche (1855)."46 Here one finds the beginnings of an argument that has become central to discussions surrounding the retouching of photographs. Written by Paul PÃ©rier (vice-president, SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de photographie) and EugÃ¨ne Durieu (president, SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de photographie), the two articles were first published in the July 1855 and October 1855 issues of the Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de photographie. As explained by RouillÃ© in his introduction to the texts, PÃ©rier, in his desire to have photography accepted as a fine art, is: Driven paradoxically to question the specificity of the medium, when in the name of the "major interests of artistic creation," he defends in 1855 the practice of retouching, thus according priority to the image over the process, the product (the "result") over its mode of production (the "means").47

In his written response to PÃ©rier, Durieu argues that PÃ©rier's statement praises the technique of retouching that is "fatal to the progress of photography."48 Durieu's position, while fiercely against the retouched, hybrid photograph (which he argues subtracts from photography's autonomy as a process), however, accepts retouching only when it is used to fix minor technical irregularities, such as air bubbles. Thus, these texts at once acknowledge the use of photographic retouching during the 1850s and call into question the limits of acceptability afforded by this technique.

However, because subsequent scholars had largely avoided photographic retouching as a topic of study, AndrÃ© Gunthert's journal article "Sans retouche," published in Ãtudes photographiques in 2008, provides an outline of this history from the nineteenth century to the present.49 Gunthert examines why "retouching has the distinction of being a practice that is systematically denied"50 in contrast to other photographic techniques, which are celebrated as achievements and advancements, and in contrast to cinema studies, wherein special effects are embraced as a topic apt for research. Gunthert also explains that while the fashion and advertising industries have more or less accepted digital manipulation, retouching techniques used by the press are still governed by a heavy moral code even though the practice of retouching is as old as press photography itself.51 Thierry Gervais' "On Either Side of the `Gatekeeper:' Technical Experimentation with Photography at L'Illustration (1880-1900)," also published in Ãtudes

photographiques,52 utilizes retouched press photographs from the late nineteenth century to raise questions about how photography and the press were "destined to meet."53 A heavily retouched and montaged photograph of a gatekeeper, published in L'Illustration in 1891 using the coated wood technique, is this essay's main focus. The editorial work done to this print and to others found in L'Illustration's archive prompts Gervais to reexamine the uses of photography by the illustrated press during the 1880s and 1890s. Gervais reviews secondary sources written about L'Illustration's publication of this image, all of which reaffirm the same technically progressive history by overlooking "the

multiple techniques invented at the crossroads of [the relationship between] the press and photography."54 According to Gervais a "chronological gap [in the historiography of press photography] at the end of the nineteenth century"55 becomes apparent when one understands that, regardless of the availability of the halftone process during this period, photographs were not used on a regular basis by the illustrated press without the addition of auxiliary printing processes. Similar to the ideas presented in "Les formes de l'information" by Gervais and Morel, discussed previously, this journal article builds on the premise that while photography and the press did "meet," so to speak, this encounter and subsequent relationship were neither straightforward nor was the adoption of the halftone process instantaneous. Analyses of the photographs found in L'Illustration's archive reveal the existence of "hybrid images resulting from the merging of drawing, printing and photography"56 at the end of the nineteenth century -- and a print media that did not immediately recognize photography's inherent qualities as a communicative medium but rather continued to use the press photograph as a cost saving tool.57 Concurrent with the more general publications reviewed in the first section of this survey, only a few academic texts were found that comprehensively addressed the histories and uses of analogue photographic retouching. RouillÃ©'s inclusion of excerpts from a debate in 1855 about retouching in his anthology of nineteenth century photographic controversies reveals the practice's importance at an early point but these appear as isolated texts. Gunthert acknowledges retouching's conspicuous omission from the history of photography and outlines the first scholarly history of the technique. Finally Gervais' essay, the most recent article surveyed, uses retouched photographs as a

Press Photography Manuals (1930-1952) A review of press photography manuals, published between the years

1930 to 1952, was also carried out in search of information about retouching practices. The five 1930s technical manuals surveyed, The Complete Press Photographer,58 News Photography,59 Press Photography,60 News Pictures61 and Pictorial Journalism,62 include an extensive range of technical and editorial-related information about this technique. However, as these manuals will be used as primary sources in the thesis' main essay, they will not be analyzed further in this survey. The 1944 manual A Guide for Military and News Photography by Jack Price63 is specific to military press photographers and does not address retouching techniques. However, this omission should not be read as an indication that retouching practices were no longer used during the 1940s, but as reflective of the impact of the Second World War and thus the need for manuals that addressed other issues.64 While this literature survey did not locate any additional press photography manuals published in English during the 1940s (The Technique of the Picture Story by Daniel D. Mich and Edwin Berman,65

published in 1945, is specific to freelance writers), my research suggests that the more extensive type of manuals of the 1930s reappeared during the 1950s. This decade long gap may indicate a slow down in the publication of press photography manuals during the 1940s, rather than an end to photographic retouching practices. However, this hypothesis requires further research. The 1951 manual Picture Editing66 includes an instructional section about retouching entitled "Art Work," in the chapter "Picture Handling." In this publication, retouching is considered as one of the many steps involved in the process of editing press photographs, along with cropping and scaling:

Every picture should go through the art department for possible retouching [...] Retouching should be done completely and carefully to any picture that needs it, but the tendency to overdo retouching should be actively discouraged. The test of a good retouching is paradoxical: A retouched picture in the paper should look like an unretouched picture!67

Published one year later, Wilson Hicks' Words and Pictures: An Introduction to Photojournalism,68 written for press photographers, editors and writers, treats the retouching of press photographs differently than Picture Editing. The manual includes a chapter titled "Birth of the Form," which restates the commonly held ideas about the technical advances made to press photography during the 1920s and 1930s:

Fundamental changes in the thinking of editors, together with [the] mechanical advancement of the camera, had revolutionary effects on production and use of the journalistic photograph in the years 19251935."69

Hicks, moreover, discusses the editorial position against photographic retouching adopted by Life during the late 1930s. However, as Life's former executive editor, Wilson Hicks was writing from a very specific standpoint -- a standpoint which, contrary to information found in the other manuals surveyed, tends to suggest that retouching practices used by the press were curtailed when Life introduced its formative editorial policy against the technique.

To conclude, the manuals surveyed feature technical and editorial information about photojournalism and retouching during the 1930s, which was generally not found in the secondary sources consulted, thus pointing out a dichotomy between what has been written about this history and what was practiced on a day-to-day basis during that period.70 As such, this literature survey suggests that academic interest in 1930s press photography has been largely focused on technical achievements, the establishment of pictorial magazines and press agencies, the expansion of the photojournalist's reach and famous news images produced during the modern period. In this regard, photographic retouching, as used by the press during the 1930s, proposes another way to analyze and understand the complex relationship between the press and photography during that decade.

Lavoie's essay does not focus on the history of retouching practices but on the history of criteria used to judge press images.

METHODOLOGY The research methodology undertaken for this thesis required continual

reevaluation. Researching and writing about the uses of photographic retouching by the press and thus the work of the picture editor during the 1930s meant working with a technical practice without a clear historiography, and developing a research process complicated by the size and scope of the Art Gallery of Ontario's (AGO) British Press Agency Collection (BPAC). The BPAC features 1,240 gelatin silver press prints from 1911 to 1986 housed in ten boxes. The collection was assembled by the Archive of Modern Conflict (London, England) and donated to the AGO by an anonymous donor in 2008.71 Comprising work from more than fifty press agencies and seventy photographers, the BPAC does not constitute a single archive. Instead, it presents a sweeping survey of primarily British press photography over a seventy five-year time span. With fifty four percent of the BPAC photographs dating from the 1930s, the collection highlights the uses of photography by the press during this decade. Although the BPAC includes works by seventy photographers, attributed prints constitute roughly one tenth of the total collection. Included are a small number of photographs by BrassaÃ¯, Cecil Beaton, Emil Otto HoppÃ©, Willi Ruge and Paul Popper, housed side by side in Box 10 with prints by less recognized and unknown photographers. Photographic agencies are better documented, as their copyright stamps mark the versos of most prints in the collection. Press agencies include: The Associated Press, Daily Mail (British and French Bureaus), Fox Photos, Keystone View Company, Planet News Ltd., BIPPA, the Photographic News Agencies (PNA), Sport & General News, The Topical Press Agency Ltd., Central Press, Wide World Photos, the General Photographic Agency, the London News Agency and Photo Press.

According to the BPAC's finding aid, 680 of the 1,240 photographs in the collection are from the 1930s.72 As part of my research, I discovered that 139 of the 1,240 prints are retouched (11.2 percent of the total number of photographs in the BPAC). Of these 139 retouched works, 97 prints (representing 69.8 percent) are from the 1930s. Thus, of the 680 1930s prints within the BPAC, 14.3 percent are retouched. However, the retouched prints in the BPAC are not comprehensively addressed in the collection's finding aid, nor are they housed together in the same box. As a result, it was necessary to examine the entire collection in order to identify and select retouched press prints from the 1930s for this study. In addition, while the BPAC was arranged chronologically when it was donated to the AGO in 2008, the prints were reorganized to better suit the AGO's author-based collections management policies and the needs of most of its researchers.73 Therefore, the 680 1930s prints in the collection are now spread throughout ten boxes, arranged by press agency, as previously noted, with one box dedicated to prints attributed to individual photographers; in some cases this organizational structure means a physical separation of the work of a given photographer from the other prints copyrighted by his/her photographic agency. Although the date stamps found on the verso of most prints in the collection are noted in the collection's original spreadsheet, they are not included in the AGO's current finding aid. Searching through the BPAC in its entirety was, therefore, necessary in order for me to view all of the retouched prints in the collection and, moreover, group together a body of work from the 1930s.

My initial selection of prints was carried out in conjunction with writing my preliminary literature survey. At that time, the selection criteria were very general and based largely on visual interest and the need to study a variety of application techniques. As such, the first selection process resulted in a group of retouched press prints from the years 1917 to 1940. However, as my research progressed I became aware of the complicated relationship between retouched press prints from the 1930s and the historiography of 1930s press photography. Therefore, I conducted an exhaustive survey of the BPAC, gathering data that would allow me to analyze the number of retouched prints in the entire collection in comparison to the percentage of retouched prints from the 1930s. I formulated a list of all 1,240 photographs in the archive, noting for each print as much of the following information as was available: date, press agency, photographer and whether or not retouching work was applied. Additionally, I created descriptive entries for the 139 retouched prints in the collection, using the following criteria. Was the print retouched heavily or lightly? Was the retouching applied to add or remove detail? Were colour fluids used and why? What were the technical faults that were being fixed with retouching fluids? How was the photograph's news value potentially affected by the retouching? This process enriched my understanding of the BPAC, helping me to form a final selection of sixteen photographs from various agencies, which range in date from 1931 to 1939 and which correspond to the uses of retouching outlined in technical manuals published during that period. The retouching work done to press prints is, moreover, an intermediary step bridging two physical objects: the photograph and the newspaper or magazine in which it was published. Because retouching is not meant to be visible in its published form, this technical process has generally been overlooked when histories of press photography have centered on subjects rather than objects. An entry into this topic of study can, therefore, be found through an analysis of the picture editor's work, with the retouched photographs acting as the link between our understanding of the uses of press   21 

photography by this editorial figure and the information presented in press photography manuals. Because The Complete Press Photographer and Pictorial Journalism were both published concurrently in the United States and England, thus confirming the sharing of editorial techniques internationally during the 1930s, I concluded that the Americanpublished manuals News Photography, Press Photography and News Pictures, were also applicable to this analysis of primarily British press prints. Furthermore, while these publications have been used as primary sources, in certain instances it was equally as important to question their points of view as it was to extract information from them. This thesis, therefore, approaches these retouched prints not as unique cases of image manipulation but as typical examples of one of the many steps involved in the process of building visual news during the 1930s. Discovering that many of the photographs were published in the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Dispatch, Life and possibly also in the Daily Mail74 allowed for comparisons with their respective published images, layouts and cutlines. However, because the online archive UKPressOnline is not extensive, I did not have access to the multiple editions of the Daily Mirror that were published each day. While I was able to locate six Daily Mirror editions that feature published versions of the retouched BPAC prints (or in certain cases similar photographs of the same news event published on a given date), I was not able to always find a published image for each print date stamped by this newspaper. Although it was not possible for me to search the Daily Mail or the Sunday Dispatch due to the time constraints of this thesis and the fact that these particular editions are only available at the British Library in London, England, I was able to gain research assistance from a colleague who searched through selected editions of the Sunday Dispatch for me.

BPAC Prints 189, 243 and 189 are copyright stamped by the Daily Mail and date stamped by the Daily Mirror. It was not possible to search for these photographs in the Daily Mail.

However, because of the policies at the British Library's Reading Rooms at Colindale, which determine that once a newspaper has been transferred to microfilm the original can no longer be viewed, it was only possible to have scans made from photocopies of the second generation facsimile. In most cases this extensive copying process degenerated the photographic images to such an extent that an analysis of the retouching work as it carried through into newsprint was no longer possible.   The analytical approach employed in chapters four and five to produce a descriptive analysis of the sixteen prints was based on methodologies outlined by Ilsen About and ClÃ©ment ChÃ©roux in their article "L'histoire par la photographie."75 The authors stress the importance of using only first generation photographs and publications as research tools to reexamine history, and employing the following working model: a. identify the photographer; b. conduct an analysis of the photographic object in its entirety; and, c. analyze the subject captured in the image.76 This thesis was, therefore, carried out in response to the two-pronged research question: What can these objects add to the history of 1930s press photography and what do these photographs tell us about the work of the picture editor during that decade? By dividing the main analysis into two chapters, "Production/Reproduction: Retouching to Improve Copy Value" and "Illustration/Narration: Retouching to Improve News Value," this thesis utilizes retouched press prints to discuss different facets of the picture editor's work, taking into consideration how aesthetics were employed in the creation and presentation of visually efficient news during the 1930s.

PRODUCTION/REPRODUCTION: RETOUCHING TO IMPROVE COPY VALUE Although the position of press picture editor was not new to the 1930s

newsroom,77 authors Laura Vitray, John Mills Jr. and Roscoe Ellard78 stressed the importance of this position in their 1939 manual Pictorial Journalism. The publication's second chapter "Picture Editing" describes the picture editor as "a new executive,"79 promoting his/her role as essential to the creation of visual news:

"The picture editor's concern is to provide art for all departments of the paper [...] A picture editor's purpose is to improve the appearance of the paper, and he can often accomplish this with great economy [...] He is above everything a news editor for pictures."80

Specific daily tasks included: supervision of the publication's photographic studio and picture desk, liaison with news desks, photographic commission and selection of photographs, writing and editing of textual cutlines, page layout and retouching work (or supervision when this work was carried out by an art department, retoucher or process artist at a larger publication).81 The position of authority held by this editorial post -- a mediator between raw press photograph and published news image -- was also addressed at the beginning of the decade in Bell R. Bell's 1930 manual The Complete Press Photographer. Bell's publication identifies the types of pictorial news most desired (and thus selected) by picture editors and the technical requirements of a press print in relation to available

halftone printing technologies. According to this manual, the combination of narrative strength and technical efficiency (namely tonal range, sharpness and detail) are crucial to the making of a good news photograph.82 At the close of the decade, Vitray, Mills and Ellard echoed this sentiment in Pictorial Journalism: "Newsphotos, we have seen, should measure up to a two-way standard for perfection. They should tell an important story and they should be good copy for halftone."83 This "two-way standard for perfection," singled-out as so important to the picture editor's selection and post-production process can, therefore, be used to examine the retouching techniques employed during the 1930s when building and creating aesthetically efficient and illustrative pictorial news images for publication by newspapers such as the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Dispatch.84 As press prints were judged for their ability to become good copy, picture editors had to decide in each case how well a given photograph would reproduce in newsprint halftone. As explained in James C. Kinkaid's 1936 manual, Press Photography: "The only positive test of a print as far as news photography is concerned is the kind of halftone it will make."85 Good copy value, as outlined by Vitray, Mills and Ellard in Pictorial Journalism, was based on three main criteria: sharp focus, good detail and tonal contrast.86 Instructions and reasons for the retouching of press photographs, provided in the fourth chapter of Pictorial Journalism, "Art Department Practice," are closely related

to these criteria. The authors state: "Newsphotos are retouched to improve copy value. This is the most important purpose of retouching."87 In order to understand these criteria, the following eight prints have been chosen to exemplify technical deficiencies, which occurred when the photograph was taken (production) and/or during the gelatin silver print's transformation into a halftone image (reproduction). Having been retouched for copy value, these objects can also be used to study the technical limits of this intermediate editorial process.

4.a

Technical Issues The retouching applied to "Well Held!" (BPAC Print 322, The Associated

Press, 1933), a photograph of the British Royal Airforce holding down the tethers of a hot air balloon, illustrates a technical difficulty that continued to trouble the press during the 1930s: the reproduction of fine photographic details in newsprint (fig. 1-2). As a photograph was transformed from a gelatin silver print to a halftone cut, and finally to a newsprint reproduction, image loss occurred; if details were deficient at the outset, the published output would be most unsatisfactory. The author of this 9.25 x 12 inch gelatin silver photograph is today unknown. Rather, this print is credited solely to The Associated Press of Great Britain, Ltd.; its poor condition reflecting both its age and commercial usage. Soiled and marked up with fingerprints, the photographic emulsion highlights and verso are yellowed; photographic blacks have faded to browns.88 As Kinkaid explained in Press Photography, because publication speed was often more important than a print's longevity, little care was taken in the chemical processing of press photographs. Referring to the most extreme of cases,

Kinkaid elucidates: "No thought is given under such circumstances to the permanence of the print. The only desire is to get a print that will last for perhaps an hour or two."89 Although Pictorial Journalism suggests applying crop marks to a print with a soft lithograph pencil or water-soluble paint to avoid permanent damage,90 with "Well Held!" best practice was forgone for a brisker and more intrusive approach. Running vertically down the right side of the photographic image is a deep fold, with a crop mark symbol hand-scripted in graphite on the emulsion to the right of this indented line. The retouching work -- blue and black water-soluble fluid applied to the print recto -- stops abruptly at these crop mark indicators. Thus, it can be deduced that in this instance layout and cropping were decided upon prior to the application of retouching paints. In an industry where speed and economy of means were vital, it is unlikely that the picture editor, who was "mindful of deadlines,"91 would have wasted time and materials retouching the entire photograph when, inevitably, press prints were usually cropped to avoid reducing the size of the image.92 In addition, illegible sizing calculations on the print verso are accompanied by The Associated Press of Great Britain's copyright stamp, applied in blue ink, and the Daily Mirror's93 publication date stamp, applied in red ink: "DM 16 NOV 1933."94 A typed cutline is adhered to the verso: "WELL HELD!"-- Activity at Larkhill, near Salisbury, where the balloon section of the Royal Air Force is stationed.

The type font and align centre spacing of the verso text suggest that it was clipped from a newspaper page. However, the published version of this print found in the London Edition of the Thursday, November 16, 1933 Daily Mirror95 (fig. 3) is accompanied by a lengthier and more descriptive cutline: The ground staff holding down a kite balloon at Larkhill, near Salisbury, where the balloon section of the R.A.F. is stationed. Army officers are sometimes sent up for observation practice in such balloons, which were extensively used during the war.96

Moreover, as the largest illustration laid out with six other unrelated photographs and several advertisements, "Well Held!" is the only image on the page highlighted by an overline: "TUG-OF-WAR" AGAINST A BALLOON."97 As illustrated by these two texts, the photograph captured British soldiers holding down the tethers of a hot air balloon. The ropes, recorded by the camera as infinitely thin lines, were seemingly too fine for newspaper reproduction. Thus, the print required retouching in order to be suitable as news copy. Referring back to Pictorial Journalism's "three point system" for judging copy value, one can note that good detail was essential in this regard as visual information was lost when converting to a halftone cut:

The reason detail is so important in the newspaper print is that so much of it is going to be lost in engraving [...] The engraver, in making the halftone cut, rephotographs the picture through a screen which breaks its solid surface up into tiny dots [...] The finer the screen used, the more dots result and therefore the more of the picture's detail is preserved.98

Generally, newspapers during the 1930s used coarser halftone screens than magazines, which printed on higher-grade coated papers.99 However, Bell's manual cites the Daily Mirror as one of a handful of British papers using a finer grade of screen:

The screen which they employ in the process of block making is comparatively very fine, and the quality of the pictures in these papers remarkably is good for daily journalism.100

Regardless, black retouching fluid was applied to this print to "retouch for detail,"101 rendering the balloon tethers more pronounced (fig. 4). Additionally, blue retouching fluid was used selectively to add tonal range to the dull grassy area in the foreground and to the soldiers and military wagon in the background. The corresponding published image printed in the Daily Mirror suggests that the retouching work done to this photograph may not have sufficed, as the tethers appear to have remained extremely faint. Although the digital scan of this page spread is poor, one can note that the section of the sky filled with these ropes was transformed into a gray tone upon publication, whereas the area above the balloon was left white, indicating that an additional step may have been taken during the printing process to clarify the existence of the balloon's rigging supports. If one compares the cutline adhered to the print verso to the text published in the Daily Mirror, the latter is also more detailed, specifying that the soldiers are holding down the balloon. Was this written content used to compensate for photographic reproduction issues? In this instance, it would seem that the picture editor was editing and re-editing text and photograph alike to ensure both a clear reproduction and a corresponding understanding of the image on the newspaper page.

In a similar manner, the flash bulb, while advantageous for the photographer shooting out in the field, was not always beneficial to the picture editor's post-production work. Nevertheless, it has been said that during the 1930s "remarkable progress"102 was made to press photography due to the introduction of the flashbulb in 1929.103 As explained in the 1937 manual News Pictures, the speedflash bulb had become "the acknowledged dependable source of artificial lighting for news photographers."104 Although An 18th century Scold's Bridle (BPAC Print 579, Graphic Photo Union, 1938) was exposed using a flash, as is evident by the reflection in the subject's eyes, the photograph's uneven exposure resulted in poor clarity of detail (fig. 5). As it was not perfect copy, this print therefore required remedying with paint and brush before it could be turned into a halftone cut. This object, a 9.75 x 7.5 inch gelatin silver print credited to the Graphic Photo Union, is in poor condition. Its two left corners are missing and there are dents and scratches in the photographic emulsion. The image highlights have yellowed and the blue fluids applied to the print recto are deteriorating. The verso has also yellowed, is soiled, and, similar to "Well Held!," is marked up with editorial notations that were penciled in and scribbled over with blue grease pencil (fig. 6). Stamped on the verso in purple ink is the London-based Graphic Photo Union's copyright logo. "S.D. 30 OCT 1938," applied in red ink, gives the print a date and place of publication: the Sunday Dispatch.105

The cutline adhered to this print's verso was, however, produced on a typewriter: A SCOLD'S BRIDLE. -- An 18th. Century Scold's Bridle of unusual design on show at the Fifth Annual Antique Fair and Exhibition at Grosvenor House, Park Lane. The bridle was placed on the head of a notorious scold who was then pilloried or [illeg] through the town as punishment. 28-10-38.

The date of "28.10.38," typed at the end of this verso text, may imply that the photograph was taken on Friday, October 28th and printed in the Sunday Dispatch two days later (fig. 7). A quirky photographic overline, "TONGUE-TIED," accompanies the published image in the Sunday paper, along with a cutline that is shorter and more light-hearted than the text present on the print's verso: They were very thorough in the 18th century. This pleasant little invention is a scold's bridal, used for nagging women. It is on view at the Antique Dealers' Fair at Grosvenor House, London.106

Although this photograph, a head and shoulders shot of a woman modeling an antique Scold's Bridle, was taken using a flash bulb, the capture resulted in an overexposed, high-key face and an underexposed, low-key jacket and background. Thus, delivered to the picture editor's desk was a print lacking sufficient detail. Dark blue fluid was therefore used to retouch for details on the coat, where the negative was too thin (fig. 8). A mid-tone of blue retouching paint was also used to add tonal range to the depthless jet-black background, while a lighter shade of blue was applied to the back of the woman's hair to distinguish it from the enveloping darkness behind her. In contrast, the

A published version of An 18th century Scold's Bridle was found in the October 30, 1938 edition of the Sunday Dispatch. However, the process involved in securing a scan from a photocopy of the microfilm holdings at the British Library, London, England, reduced visibility to a point where the effects of the retouching work done to the original print cannot be analyzed. From this scan, one can note that this photograph was printed as a small illustration, in the top right corner of p.13, in column seven of a sevencolumn layout.

 

36 

While the flashbulb's contributions to press photography during the 1930s were most important, allowing photographs to be taken with artificial light in circumstances unwieldy to magnesium flash powder,108 this technology did not resolve the need for corrective work. However, by selectively retouching only the areas that required it most, one can see that the Sunday Dispatch's staff were cautious not to overwork the image, mindful of time, economy and final outcome. Highlighting the picture editor's meticulous approach, Vitray, Mills and Ellard write:

He knows the right amount of retouching is what is required to bring the picture up to reproduction standards, whether this means none, or a very slight amount, or so much that it seems like painting a new picture over the old shell.109

4.b

Production Issues In comparison to the previous two photographs, which were retouched "a

very slight amount,"110 A snowstorm that caught the holiday-makers (BPAC Print 441, Topical Press Agency Ltd., 1937) exemplifies the opposite approach: "painting a new picture over the old shell."111 Shot during a snowstorm, the soft focus, blurry image has poor detail and low contrast. However, the editor used this photograph's production problems to his/her advantage, as the retoucher improved the print's copy value and strengthened its visual qualities in the process (fig. 9). Printed in the Daily Mirror on Saturday, March 27, 1937, this photograph can also be used to discuss how retouching work was made invisible upon publication.

Credited to the Topical Press Agency Ltd., A snowstorm that caught the holidaymakers (a 7.75 x 9.5 inch gelatin silver photograph) commemorates its age as an eighty plus year old press print. The corners are dog-eared and the image highlights and borders have yellowed. There are deep, invasive fold lines running horizontally along the top and bottom of the object. Although the retouching work stops at these folds, these indicators do not correspond with how the print was cropped when published in the Daily Mirror (fig. 11). As previously discussed, Pictorial Journalism cautions that damaged areas on the print recto, caused by improperly applied crop marks, would show up in the halftone cut should more of the image be desired.112 Notably, a larger area at the bottom of this print was indeed published, with additional dead space at the top of the image having been cropped out instead. However, there is no evidence of a fold line appearing in the newspaper reproduction. These indentations, on the other hand, are clearly visible on the print verso, which is also stained, soiled and marked up with notations (fig. 10). Stamped on the verso in purple ink is the Topical Press Agency's copyright (London address included). The Daily Mirror's red inked date stamp is also present: "D.M. 27 MAR 1937." A typed cutline adhered to the verso reads: "The Miserable Side of Yesterday's weather. A Snowstorm that caught the holiday makers on the Epping road." Although the combined use of a bold and regular type face and the centre aligned spacing of the font would suggest that the verso text was clipped from a newspaper layout, it differs from the cutline accompanying this photograph in the Daily Mirror:

Joys of the open road near Epping. Men in the police car -- see the loud speaker -- on patrol duty had no cause to envy the holiday-makers, especially cyclists.113

As implied by these texts, the photograph shows a cyclist riding alongside automobiles during a snowstorm. From the blurred image and the photographer's position in front of oncoming traffic, one can surmise that it was likely taken from the back of a moving vehicle, with the intent to capture a dynamic action shot of cars and bikes along a snowy road. Despite the photographic equipment made available to photojournalists during that period, which prompted them to extend their reach,115 the less than optimal

conditions under which this ambitious shot was taken were problematic to its production nonetheless. As such, the poor capture became poor copy: out of focus, bad detail, muddy tones. However, as the photograph would have rated high in news value, being local news and an action shot,116 the print was not dismissed. As noted in Pictorial Journalism, Christmas shoppers caught in a snowstorm would always serve a newspaper well:

Rushing crowds, at the business hour, Christmas shoppers caught in a whirl of snow, traffic policemen in new uniforms -- these and ten thousand other feature subjects are at the picture editor's elbow, and they have instant appeal.117

Thus it would seem that the picture editor used this photograph's technical shortfalls to his/her advantage during the editorial process. Lines of blue retouching fluid, applied with a brush in various shades of blue, add clarity of detail to the moving cars and cyclist; short lines of light blue and white, applied briskly, were employed to reinforce the appearance of falling snow. Markedly, this retouching application works with the blurred image to highlight the hazardous conditions that occur during a bad snowstorm (fig. 12).

Because retouching fluids were generally applied to an enlargement, once the photograph was scaled down for reproduction the handwork -- if done well -- would be unnoticeable in newsprint. If necessary, the retouched print was photographed and the copy print reworked to better camouflage the initial editing attempt.118 As noted by Vitray, Mills and Ellard, "The worst that can be said of retouching is that it shows in the halftone."119 In this case, with a few tricks of the process artist's brush, retouching techniques were employed by the Daily Mirror's photo-editorial staff to convert poor photographic copy into visually efficient news copy. Placed in the lower centre of a two-page spread, along with eight other unrelated photographic illustrations, this snowstorm scene now holds its own, competing fiercely for visual attention with the leggy starlet in the image laid out above it and the boat sail jutting in from the right (fig. 11). Civic Guards charging a crowd of rioters (BPAC Print 86, Wide World Photos, 1931), captured on the spot during a riot, also resulted in a poorly produced photograph of high news value. Taken in Spain, the image is soft in focus with poor detail. In comparison to A snowstorm that caught the holiday-makers, this print is too high in contrast and thus retouching work was used to tone down the exposure (fig. 13). An analysis of the published photograph located in the Daily Mirror (September 7, 1931; fig. 17) suggests that this lack of clear detail caused by too much contrast allowed the picture editor to bend said news story to his/her will.

The oldest of the 16 prints analyzed in this thesis, this 7.25 x 9.75 inch gelatin silver photograph is in relatively good condition. However, the photographic emulsion has yellowed in the highlights and the verso is littered with fingerprints. Asserting ownership of the image, the London branch of Wide World Photos copyright stamped the print verso in black ink (fig. 14). A red-inked Daily Mirror stamp, "D.M. 7 SEP 1931," also present, corresponds with a reproduction found on page 3 of the London Edition of that day's paper (fig. 17). In addition, two cutlines are adhered to this object's verso. Firstly, one can see remnants of a piece of text typed in black ink, which was likely the photographer's original description of the event.120 Although no longer legible in full, one can note a location name from this shred of paper: "Saragossa, Spain." A second cutline, formatted in a justified type set with a faint hairline rule visible at the top of the clipping, was likely pulled from a newspaper (fig. 15):

TURBULENT SPAIN. -- Civic Guards charging a crowd of rioters in a street of Saragossa, where labour troubles have caused wild disturbances. A reign of terror continues in Barcelona.

"Always be careful to paste the proper caption on the back of each print. Do not write on the print [...]. If you must write use a soft pencil and write lightly. The better procedure is to type your description on a strip of paper and paste this to the back of the photograph." Price, News Photography, 92.

However, the cutline published below this photograph in the Daily Mirror (fig. 16) points to a riot in Barcelona, making no reference to the civil unrest in Saragossa: Civil Guards fighting with rioters in the streets of Barcelona during the disturbances, in which twenty people were killed and many injured.121

Fig. 16. Daily Mirror, London Edition, Monday, September 7, 1931, p. 3 (detail)

The photographer, having followed the general rules for photographing such events, captured the riot scene from an elevated viewpoint. The manual Press Photography suggests adopting precisely this strategy: "In covering parades, fires, blasts, riots and similar assignments, the best way to get a good picture is to get above the scene and aim the camera downward."122 However because the shot was `snapped' so fast, and likely clandestinely, the image is out of focus. Although in this case there was enough light present to allow a brief exposure that would stop action, the rioters' movements, while forever frozen in time, are nevertheless out of focus. It would seem that the negative was also too high in contrast, as both shadow and highlight areas lack detail; the harsh shadows pounding the pavement are barely distinguishable from the men creating them. Bell's The Complete Press Photographer explains that the finer halftone screen employed by the Daily Mirror required "a print that is not too contrasty."123 As such,

shades of blue retouching fluid were applied to subdue the harsh shadows cast on the street, while blue fluids add tonal contrast to the rioters in motion. In addition, from the reproduction printed in the Daily Mirror (fig. 17), one can see that the bottom and left sides of the photograph were cropped, ridding the image of extended foreground space and the large shadow area in the top right corner of the composition. With little details to denote a location, the published image takes on a graphic aesthetic, illustrating a riot in a very general way. The close cropping and high contrast, moreover, make it nearly impossible to identify the photograph's location. Thus, editing the cutline to relocate the riot would have changed how the photograph was seen.

With Civic Guards charging a crowd of rioters, retouching techniques were used to fix problems of production and reproduction. However, by cropping and retouching the picture editor was also able to create a riot in Barcelona from a riot in Saragossa. By editing this photograph, along with its accompanying text, the picture editor produced the news story that he/she needed for the September 7, 1931 edition of the Daily Mirror.124 In contrast to the previous two photographs (fig. 9; fig. 13), whose poor copy values were reworked to an editorial advantage, A Spanish mother arrives in France (BPAC Print 627, Keystone View Company, 1937; fig. 18) raises questions regarding the use of photographic retouching as it related to copy value versus news value. This photograph may be an example of poor copy that prompted the editor to publish an alternate image of lesser news value. It is equally possible, however, that A Spanish mother arrives in France may have replaced this other photograph published in the Daily Mirror on Thursday, February 9, 1939 (fig. 20).125 This 11.5 x 9.5 inch gelatin silver print is soiled, yellowed and dog-eared. The Keystone View Company's faded red copyright stamp brands its verso, as does the Daily Mirror's date stamp: "D.M. 9 FEB 1939"126 (fig. 19). In addition, penciled editorial crop marks and sizing calculations on the verso include arrows, crop lines and calculations, suggesting that this photograph was indeed worked on and slated for publication.

"In addition to answering the question, Does the picture say what it is intended to say? the editor asks and answers another question, Does it say what I want it to say?" Wilson Hicks, Words and Pictures: An Introduction to Photojournalism (New York: Arno Press, 1973. First published 1952 by Harper and Row Publishers, Inc.), 60. 125 The Daily Mirror published several editions each day; although a single edition would generally feature 60 photographs, the total number of photographs in use on a given day would often total 80. Bell, 76-77.  126 "DUPLICATE SENT 4.26pm, 8 Feb 1939 TO MANCHESTER," stamped on the print verso in black ink, indicates that the photograph was taken one or more days prior to its publication date.

While a search for this photograph in the February 9, 1939 Daily Mirror revealed that another photograph featuring a refugee Spanish mother and children was published in this newspaper on the same date (fig. 20), the cutline adhered to the BPAC print's verso suggests that A Spanish Mother Arrives in France was also printed, most likely in an alternate edition of that day's Mirror. This verso text is type set in a justified format; hairline rules form a column enclosure around the characters:

AND THEY'RE THREE OF THOUSANDS: A Spanish mother arrives at Le Perthus, on the Franco-Spanish frontier with her family of three -- and with the mule that carries all she has left of her home. They have tramped many a weary mile along roads teeming with refugees in unbroken procession.

As the cutline describes, this photograph features a young mother and three children; a donkey trails behind them loaded up with possessions. The mother, a slender, fresh-faced woman with messy hair, is carrying her youngest child, whom she holds close to her body. Two older children, wearing clothes much too large for them, walk on either side of her. Although the two figures in the background of this photograph are out of focus, their body language, as per their outstretched and folded arms, adds to the sense of malaise experienced by the main subjects. Because the shot was heavily backlit, all details are soft in focus. Therefore, blue retouching fluid was used to add clarity of detail to the subjects. A sense of three dimensionality was rendered in by "running a narrow stroke of the brush around"127 the contours of the figures' clothing, the donkey's body and the belongings that it is carrying. However, although the backlighting is responsible for this overall hazy aesthetic, it does create good contrast between the dark subjects in the foreground and light-toned

background. Nevertheless, as explained in News Photography, backlighting was considered ill-suited to press photography:

A picture should never be taken with the lens aimed directly at the light unless it is the photographer's wish to get some unusual effect. In newspaper work such effects are neither necessary nor wanted. Papers want only those pictures that will reproduce well, make a good "cut," which is the trade vernacular for halftone.128

Notably, the photograph published in the Daily Mirror is also backlight, but in this case the effects are less pronounced (however one cannot discount the likelihood that this photograph was also retouched).

Laid out as a full-page illustration, the published photograph begins in column four of page 16, bleeding over the gutter of this tabloid-format newspaper and consuming the entire layout of page 17. A photographic overline in bold upper case type follows the image across both spreads, exclaiming: "WEARY FEET... HEAVY HEARTS."129

However, in comparison to the young mother featured in A Spanish Mother Arrives in France, this photograph captures an older looking woman who is disheveled and homely. In addition, she appears less connected with her children as she does not walk beside them, nor does she cradle a baby to her chest. Rather, this mother strains to pull a donkey that has two children riding on its back. Moreover, there are many others trudging along with them, including a man pushing a cart into the right foreground of the image. As such, the accompanying published cutline is significantly less personal:

And Their Homeland Behind Them. Throughout the night they have tramped, these mothers of Spain -- that once was sunny Spain -- away from guns, from bombs, from the fear of vengeance, to the sanctuary of France. Shoes worn through, feet weary, all they have left are their children, their eyes to weep with -- and LIBERTY.130

Thus, while both images and texts illustrate the same news story, they make use of different visual cues. Whereas A Spanish mother arrives in France conjures up images of a romanticized Madonna and child, the published photograph is less iconic. As noted in Pictorial Journalism, "Romance, love and hate -- is news."131 How then does one explain the publication of another photograph with potentially less news value? While the retouching work done to A Spanish mother arrives in France was applied for technical reasons (employed to improve the print's copy value), one is left wondering at the use of another image by the Daily Mirror and, moreover, which

photograph was selected to replace the other in that day's paper? As will be discussed in Chapter 5, Section C, "Retouching, Composition and Page Layout," press photographs were also considered in relation to a newspaper spread's graphic design, yet an additional influence on the picture editor's selection process and another possible reason for the Daily Mirror's use of this other photograph. Photographic retouching was, after all, but one mediatory step of many in the structuring of visual news.

Reproduction Issues Picture editors were hardly judging news photographs for their strength as

gelatin silver prints. In spite of being a well-exposed and finely executed photograph, Czechoslovakia's training in national defense (BPAC Print 526, Paul Popper, 1938; fig. 21) required working up with paint to improve its copy value, thus highlighting the difference between a photographic object and photographic copy. However, in this case, although the image was printed in Life, the reproduction was not made from the BPAC print. As such, unretouched areas of the object itself are used to explain why this handwork was carried out. In contrast to the other photographs discussed in this thesis, Czechoslovakia's training in national defense is credited to an author: Paul Popper.132 An 8.75 x 9.5 inch gelatin silver photograph, this object is in very good condition; the image highlights and print verso have hardly yellowed or faded. As noted in The Complete Press Photographer, it was recommended that negatives be submitted to agencies and newspapers whenever possible, instead of prints.133 In those cases when importance was                                                         
132

Paul Popper was a European photojournalist who moved to London to become a literary and photographic agent, establishing Popperfoto in 1934. See: "Societa Italiana per lo studio della storia contemporanea," http://www.sissco.it/index.php?id=1084. The agency is now owned by Getty Images. See: Getty Images, "We're Proud to Welcome Paul Popper to Getty Images," http://corporate.gettyimages.com/Marketing/m12/Popperfoto/usa/index.html.  133 Bell, 119.

placed on production speed, less care would have been given to a print's archival longevity.134 However, if Popper printed this photograph himself, he may have been more studious during the development process than a darkroom technician. The object's verso is copyright stamped not by an agency, but by Popper: "PHOTO SUPPLIED BY PAUL POPPER FURNIVAL HOUDE [...] LONDON [...]" -- the Furnival Houde address confirming that Popper was based in London during this period (fig. 22). Although the Sunday Dispatch's red-inked date stamp, "S.D. 20 MAR 1938," is also present on the verso, the photograph was not found in the Sunday paper printed on that date. As Bell's "Press Book Abbreviations" list suggests, the letters NP were to be used to signify "Not Published" in a photographer's logbook.135 As such, the verso notations, "1 col x 5" SD NP [illeg] 2 Blocks," may indicate that this particular photograph was not sent to print. In addition, as the verso is not date stamped by Life, it is likely that Popper sent a second print across the sea for use by the weekly magazine (fig. 23). The photo credit, which accompanied the image in Life, moreover, gives sole authorship to the agency European,136 a copyright stamp not present on the BPAC print. Furthermore, as the cutline adhered to Popper's photograph was produced on a typewriter it does not appear to have been clipped from either publication. It reads:

CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S TRAINING IN NATIONAL DEFENSE NOW STARTS AT THE AGE OF SIX. Children in military training. PHOTO: Running for safety during an air raid when wearing a gas mask is no easy matter, so these boys gain valuable experience by taking part in an obstacle race at their camp. Their masks give them an almost ghoulish appearance. (2).

Popper's Life-published photograph is featured in the section, "The Camera Overseas," and is accompanied by a photographic overline that reads:

"CZECHOSLOVAK CHILDREN ARE READY FOR GERMANY'S NEXT MOVE."137 The image, while laid out underneath a short textual article about this topic, takes up 9.125 x 10 inches of the 10.25 x 14 inch magazine page and is clearly the focus of the spread (fig. 23).

Czechoslovakia's training in national defense shows a group of gas mask-clad boys participating in an air raid exercise. They are running through a clearing in the forest towards Popper's lens. Two of the boys are out of focus, their bodies cut off at the edges of the frame in the right hand side and bottom left corners of the foreground. These two figures aside, the photograph is well focused, with good clarity of detail and contrast. The three large crop marks applied to the recto with blue retouching fluid suggest that the Sunday Dispatch's picture editor had planned to narrow in on the boys in the centre of the image. From the unretouched figures outside of these crop marks one can see that the dark-toned gas masks, while well rendered on the gelatin silver photograph, would have been less visually effective as newsprint halftone. As explained in Pictorial Journalism, standards used to judge a photograph were not the same as those used to judge would-be press copy. The press print was but an intermediary object:

If the newspaper reader were going to see original photographs instead of their reproductions on newsprint, the task of judging and selecting would be easier. However, before any news shots can reach the reader, they must be subjected to engraving and printing process which may enhance or destroy the story they have to tell.138

As such, the gas masks within the vertical crop marks in Popper's photograph were skillfully painted over with light to medium shades of blue. The eye sockets, however, were left their natural photographic black. White and blue retouching fluids, applied as thin contour lines, were also employed to better define the boys' clothes, shoes and skin. Yet the purpose of this work was not to enhance the boys' "ghoulish" appearance, but to ensure that tonal ranges and clarity of outline would translate equally well into a halftone reproduction as they did in the original photograph.

56 

Determining whether or not Popper's photograph was also retouched by Life would only be possible through an analysis of the print used by the magazine to make its reproduction. However, one can see from the Life spread that the magazine refrained from cropping the image. In addition, the photograph sent to Life is closer to full frame of the negative. Whereas the boy on the right side of the BPAC photograph is but a bent arm dangling from the edge of the frame, in the Life-published version one can also see a small portion of his shorts and leg. The same is true of the left side of the composition, which shows slightly more of the out of focus boy captured in the left foreground. A minor refocus of the enlarger up or down is the probable cause of this small visual discrepancy, which suggests once again that Popper produced multiple enlargements and that the reproduction in the Life publication was done from another print. Nevertheless, one can see that even though Czechoslovakia's training in national defense is a well executed gelatin silver photograph, the picture editor at the Sunday Dispatch considered it necessary to include retouching as part of the pre-publication work done to this object. Despite improvements made to darkroom materials and equipment, as described in the instructional chapter "Enlarging-Drying" in Price's News Pictures, retouching was rarely omitted from the editorial process. Quite the opposite, according to Price, who exclaims promptly: "This artistic pointing up is done with almost all prints before they go to the engraving department."139 Such was also the case with photographs sent over the news wire. Prior to their arrival on the picture editor's desk, images sent via radio transmission were exposed to a series of intermediate transformations new to the press at large during 1930s.140

On January 1, 1935, The Associated Press (AP) inaugurated the Wirephoto network, followed one year later by the portable Wirephoto transmitter.141 Photographic prints were transformed into photoelectric currents, sent cross-country and around the globe at the rate of one inch per minute over the AP's network lines, only to become secondgeneration negatives on the receiving end. If sending and receiving machines were improperly calibrated, exposure lines would be visible on the facsimile negative.142 Until the end of the 1940s, when vast improvements were made to this technology, a loss in copy value regularly occurred during the sending and receiving process.143 Wirephoto transmission is thus the likely cause of the misaligned line structure, flat tonal range and lack of clear detail plaguing Men of General Varela's army (BPAC Print 399, The Associated Press, 1936; fig. 24). Yet, only minimal retouching work was carried out on this print. One questions, what effect did this technology have on the need for and uses of corrective retouching work? Men of General Varela's army is copyright stamped on its verso by The Associated Press Photo's London office. A 9.5 x 11.5 inch gelatin silver photograph, this print was clearly treated as an intermediary object. The emulsion has yellowed severely, likely from a rushed processing job by The AP's darkroom staff, who would have developed and printed the second generation negative upon receiving the electronic transfer. Damage was also caused by careless crop notations: multiple folds scar the print's left, right and top areas. Reinforced graphite lines on the verso, moreover, indicate which of these indentations were to be used as crop mark guides (fig. 25). Editorial markings and calculations are also visible on the print verso, while a redinked Daily Mirror stamp, "D.M. -9 NOV 1936," denotes a likely time and place of

publication.144 In addition, a cutline, which appears to be a newspaper clipping, is also pasted on to the verso (overtop a now removed piece of paper that still bears the faint marks of a typewriter produced text). This cutline includes a sentence, crossed out with blue grease pencil, which suggests that the image was published as part of a series:

Men of General Varela's army examining a tank -- stated to be Russian -- which was abandoned by the fleeing Res near Getafe the "Corydon" of Madrid. Right: a church at Getafe reduced to ruins by shell fire.

Upon closer inspection of the soldier in the centre of the image (standing in front of the Russian tank), one can see that the photograph is distorted by a horizontal jagged line structure (fig. 26), a deficiency caused when it was sent over the wire. Wirephoto transmission involved wrapping a positive print around a revolving cylinder on the sending end. A light beam worked its way across the print horizontally at one inch per minute, while the cylinder rotated at 100 revolutions per minute, scanning the print in strips 1/100 of an inch in width and converting tonal ranges into electric currents. On the receiving end, an unexposed negative was wrapped around on a synchronized rotating cylinder; a light beam moved across the film, exposing a second generation negative of equal tonal values to the original.145 However, as noted in 20 Years with AP Wirephoto, "Obviously, any photograph lost something in quality during the process of transmitting it over thousands of miles of networked lines."146 Moreover, the width of the light beam, if properly adjusted, would unite the exposure lines, making them undetectable on the final positive print. As evidenced by Men of General Varela's army this process was not always perfect.

In addition to this visible line structure, Men of General Varela's Army has poor tonal values -- muddy dark tones with little to no information in the highlights. As clarity of detail is also less than optimal, the image lacks an overall sense of threedimensionality. However, shades of blue retouching fluid were applied very gingerly to clarify contour details and help define image values in darker areas of the print. Markedly, the ruled lines were not retouched.

What did Wirephoto technology really mean for the picture editor, now working with second-generation negatives and prints? A chronological comparison of 1930s press photography manuals may suggest that photographic retouching was in greater use by the daily press during the second half of the decade. Although a direct link between Wirephoto transmission and retouching practices is not addressed in these publications, a potential relationship may be traced that corresponds with this shift from working with slow-to-arrive first generation prints and negatives versus the light speed arrival of second-generation negatives with degraded copy values. For example, Price's 1932 manual News Photography criticizes retouching as a practice that can waste precious time,147 while his 1937 manual News Pictures cites the technique as a standard technical necessity.148 In Pictorial Journalism, published at the tail end of the decade in 1939,

retouching techniques and applications are explained in great detail, within the larger context of picture editing and the many journalistic shifts that occurred during the decade.149 Certainly, the Wirephoto network facilitated the speedier delivery of visual news from 1935 onward. What precisely this meant to the process of photographic editing, however, requires further study. The picture editor, now working with second-generation prints such as Men of General Varela's army, had a new set of circumstances to consider and additional technical deficiencies to account for when selecting, retouching and reproducing press photographs.

Retouching Issues What were the standards and limitations set out by picture editors when

retouching press prints for copy value during the 1930s? Franco's troops (BPAC Print 551, Planet News, 1938) was selected for this study because of its ability to raise more questions than it answers in this regard. As noted in Pictorial Journalism, an overretouched face would become "vulgar"150 upon publication. But was this concern for evading a crude-looking output the only reason to avoid overworking poor copy? Franco's troops, a 7 x 10.5 inch gelatin silver photograph, has crop lines running vertically down both sides of its recto; "[illeg] Repeat of Lead" is handwritten in black ink on the bottom right hand corner of the emulsion (fig. 27). The verso is copyright stamped by Planet News Ltd.; although "DM 17/6/38" is written on the verso in pencil, this photograph was not found in this edition of the Daily Mirror. Moreover, the editorial notations "R.F 8S SHIN Ruler See Facial" were handwritten on the verso in graphite only to be scribbled over with blue grease pencil (fig. 28).

There are two cutlines adhered to the verso of this print. What is likely the photographer's original type-written text was removed and the picture editor's justified, column-set, newspaper-clipped cutline was pasted over top of it. Included in the cutline is a now crossed-out sentence, which similar to the text adhered to Men of General Varela's army, points to a second image published to the photograph's right:

Within a few hours of Franco's troops completing the conquest of Castellon, key to Valencia, these pictures of their occupation of the city reached London yesterday. This marching-in picture, after 36 hours of almost non-stop advance, has the added interest of facial studies. Right, Franco men in a street battle on the city outskirts.

Four soldiers are pictured leading a group of marching troops, while a boy runs on the sidewalk beside them, trying to keep up with the action. The photographer, having jumped in front of the scene, captured the soldiers walking briskly towards his lens. As a result, the shot is out of focus and underexposed, with little tonal range and detail. Blue and black retouching fluids were, however, applied only sparingly when adding clarity of outline and tonal range to the soldiers' clothing, faces and shoes. For example, the men's nostrils and eyes were retouched ever so slightly with black paint to add clarity of detail and contrast to their facial features (fig. 29).

Fig. 29. BPAC Print 551, Planet News, 1938 (recto: detail)

 

64 

From the cutline adhered to the print verso, one can see that this photograph was being marketed to readers as an opportunity for "facial studies" of Franco's troops. What constituted over-retouching a face as opposed to reworking an out of focus print into better photographic copy? Clearly, the picture editor requested that the retoucher "[supply] the missing detail and contrast,"151 but in this case only minor corrective rendering was carried out. One is left to question why so little retouching was done to a print with such poor copy value? According to Pictorial Journalism, retouchers had to be extremely careful dealing with facial features, otherwise an unnatural effect would be observed upon publication:

Retouching for detail means sometimes painting in essential details, such as eyes and nose and mouth in a face, when these have been blurred or are indistinct. [...] The purpose of such retouching is to produce not exaggerated effects but natural effects in halftone. [...] Overdone retouching, like overuse of cosmetics, is vulgar in its effect on the spectator. 152

Earlier in the decade, Price's 1932 manual News Photography made a similar point:

The essential thing about a news picture is the honesty of the likeness. Photographic beauty is not necessary, but a faithful likeness of the subject's face is. The readers are interested in what he looks like.153

Were different criteria applied to one type of news story versus another? In Wilson Hicks' Words and Pictures, Life's anti-retouching policy reportedly determined that "if a picture was important or interesting enough, it was used, unretouched, even though of inferior technical quality."154 Although it is possible that this photograph's news value --

the study of facial expressions on Franco's troops -- was deemed more important than its deficiency as poor copy, the question remains as to how these soldiers' faces would have been viewable in newsprint if the image were unable to translate effectively into a halftone cut.

Without sufficient copy value, a press photograph would run into difficulty translating as legible upon publication in newsprint. Thus, it would seem that the picture editor's selection and editorial process looked not to the many great advancements in photographic technologies during the 1930s, but to the print that landed on his/her desk, questioning in each case how a given gelatin silver photograph would be rendered as a halftone reproduction. While the equipment made available to press photographers during this decade was certainly beneficial with regard to production, reproduction problems persisted. Just as textual cutlines were edited, so too were photographs retouched. In the same way that a poorly written cutline would be confusing to read, a photograph with poor copy values would become difficult to comprehend visually on the printed page.

ILLUSTRATION/NARRATION: RETOUCHING TO IMPROVE NEWS VALUE Price's News Pictures situates press photography as vital -- "an essential

ingredient"155 -- to the dissemination of news during the 1930s. Price maintains that newspapers, following the lead of pictorial magazines, must "repeat and amplify the [written] news by saying it with pictures."156 Accordingly, Price reminds photographers that technical finesse is not the singular key to the picture editor's heart -- or selection process, more specifically -- as a technically poor photograph of an important news event could, as discussed in the previous chapter, be remedied if "worked up with a pen and brush."157 Likewise, Pictorial Journalism emphasizes the importance of narrative value; Vitray, Mills and Ellard explain that news photographs cannot merely be good copy, they must also tell a story: "If they answer to the second requirement [good copy] and not the first [the telling of a story], they are useless."158 Kinkaid's Press Photography assumes a similar standpoint: "Of all the rules that might be laid down for press photographers, the most important is that the picture should tell a story."159 As will become evident in the analysis of the handwork done to the following prints, the 1930s picture editor also employed retouching techniques as a way to help enable the press photograph to deliver its narrative. In this regard, aesthetics can be considered as a tool used to render the photograph into a more efficient storyteller. Through the addition and removal of visual information and by employing retouching in concert with explanatory cutlines and in relation to page layout, the editor worked with

5.a

Retouching to Add Visual Information The second hockey puck painted on to U.S. Hockey team loses to

Canadians (BPAC Print 109, Planet News, 1932) altered the news story originally captured on film. The publication of this photograph in the October 6, 1935 Sunday Dispatch reveals that this retouching work enhanced narrative value by better reflecting the fast-paced action of the sport. Moreover, in the process of moving the puck over to the right, the editor also reduced the space required for this image on the newspaper page. The poor condition of this 7.5 x 9.5 inch gelatin silver photograph reflects its age and heavy use. The object's left side is cracked, its corners dog-eared and missing (fig. 30). Crop folds travel vertically across the print's sides and horizontally through its top section. The verso, heavily soiled and yellowed, is a maze of stamps and editorial notations (fig. 31). A black inked date stamp, "15 FEB 1932," marks the print's earliest (probable) date of publication, followed by "D.M. 20 JAN 1934" (stamped in red ink), "SD 11/2/1934" (handwritten in blue grease pencil) and finally "S.D. 6 OCT 1935" (stamped in red ink).160 In addition, the print is copyright stamped by the London-based Planet News. The typed cutline adhered to the verso is, however, credited to ACME:

US HOCKEY TEAM LOSES TO CANADIANS. CANADA DEFEATED THE UNITED STATES, TWO GOALS TO ONE, IN AN OVERTIME MATCH--THE FIRST HOCKEY CONTEST OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS WHICH OPENED TODAY, FEB 4, AT LAKE PLACID, N.Y. [...] HERE'S AN ACTION VIEW DURING THE GAME. CREDIT LINE (ACME)

As there are no initials preceding the 15 FEB 1932 stamp it is not known where this first publication occurred. Searches for this photograph in the January 20, 1934 edition of the Daily Mirror and the February 11, 1934 edition of the Sunday Dispatch were inconclusive. The photograph was found published in the October 6, 1935 edition of the Sunday Dispatch.

Taken at the 1932 Olympics in Lake Placid, New York on February 4th, the photograph features four hockey players -- two Americans and two Canadians161 -- centered in the middle of a generously composed horizontal shot. Blue and white retouching fluids were used to add clarity of detail to the men, sticks and net. While the image captured by the photographer shows an American player chasing the puck in the offensive zone, a second puck painted onto the photograph in closer proximity to him alters the play at hand; the American player is now stick handling the puck. This change makes for a clearer and more lively action shot, as the American now fights for this object against two Canadian defenders, rather than hovering ambiguously near it. The fold marks visible on the print recto confirm that the original puck was to be cropped out upon publication (fig. 32).

As Price explains in News Pictures, the 1930s public was not savvy to editorial mediations, making it easier for newspapers to make necessary alterations:

Questionable news and pictures are accepted by readers because they have no way of distinguishing between the true and the false, and consequently digest their newsprint with an unquestioning faith in the honesty of newspapers.162

Rather than a matter of truth versus fakery, however, it would seem that the picture editor supervised the retouching of this photograph with specific goals in mind. The publication of U.S. Hockey team loses to Canadians in the October 6, 1935 edition of the Sunday Dispatch shows that this painting on of a second puck at once created a better action shot and facilitated the sizing down of what would have been a two column image into a single column slot, allowing the text to dominate the space allotted to the news story (fig. 33). The editor, by moving the puck over to the right, was able to crop the photograph into a slender portrait (vertical) format, thus eliminating the excess ground captured on both sides of the players. On the other hand, had the entire composition been scaled down to fit into a single column, the men would have become miniscule and the puck a mere dot. Furthermore, in making these alterations, the editor transformed the photograph from a conservatively composed image into a fast-paced snapshot. Three of the players, now cropped mid-way through their bodies, suggested to readers that the photograph was shot with utmost rapidity in order to keep up with the speed of this swift sport. Although it was not possible to determine when this retouching work was carried out, and in which of the four possible publications it first appeared, one can note that for this final printing the Sunday Dispatch utilized the three-year-old photograph to illustrate the article "Rinks Flout the Ice Hockey Association: Canada and the United States

Outlaw Men Who Play for English Clubs."163 The story discusses the American and Canadian Associations and the probable prohibition of their Olympic teams from playing in England. The cutline published underneath the photograph reads: "Ice-hockey -- the fastest game on earth."164 Although neither text addresses the 1932 Olympic game specifically, one can further note a direct relationship between the sense of speed inferred by the cutline text and the fast-paced action shot that U.S. Hockey team loses to Canadians became after the editorial retouching and cropping work.

Just as Civic Guards charging a crowd of rioters' textual cutline was re-written to change the location of a photographed riot from Saragossa to Barcelona, here the editor reworked the image itself, altering the play originally captured by the camera and narrowing in on the print's centre of action to infer a snapshot aesthetic and reduce the size of the photograph. Although it remains unknown whether these editorial decisions were made specifically for the 1935 Sunday Dispatch printing or for an earlier run, the visual information added to U.S. Hockey team loses to Canadians was, in any case, part of the many production considerations of this last publication. In comparison, the reasons for and outcomes of facial expressions painted on to the hooded men featured in Eastbourne hotel workers protesting (BPAC Print 527, Keystone View Company, 1938) are less clear than for the hockey puck added to U.S. Hockey team loses to Canadians. Rather, this photograph (fig. 34) prompts one to consider the fine line between retouching for detail to improve copy value and the addition of visual information that tailors narrative structure, thereby enriching its news value. In addition, the published version of Eastbourne hotel workers protesting, found in the March 20, 1938 edition of the Sunday Dispatch reaffirms the difficulties associated with analyzing retouching work when such applications are considerably subtle and access to the newspaper reproduction is limited to a fourth generation copy. This 8 x 10 inch gelatin silver print, although soiled, is less marked up than U.S. Hockey team loses to Canadians, likely because it was only published once (fig. 35). Pressed on the verso in red ink are the London-based Keystone View Company's copyright stamp and the Sunday Dispatch's publication date stamp: "S.D. 20 MAR 1938." The editorial notation, "2 cuts x 6cm/ S.D. NP. [illeg]," handwritten in graphite on the verso, suggests that in this case N.P. was not an acronym for "not published," as the photograph was indeed found in the March 20, 1938 edition of the Sunday paper (fig. 36).

Both texts read: But not the French kind. Just Eastbourne hotel workers protesting against working conditions and pay, and wearing hoods to prevent identification.165

One can also see fragments of a typewriter-produced cutline on the print verso, likely the photographer's suggested text, now since removed from the object. Although no longer legible, a single word, "WORK," is partially visible.

Protesting hotel workers wearing sandwich boards and holding signs are captured in this photograph (fig. 34; fig. 39). They picket in a long singular queue, which begins in the foreground of the image and runs in a continual line, set on the diagonal because of the photographer's front-left position and use of a wide angle lens, and ending where the horizon point and background converge. Black hoods mask their identities and, in addition, create a sequence of black triangular shapes with little to no photographic detail. These faceless protestors lack narrative value, as their hoods cause them to appear inanimate. As discussed in Chapter 1, this technical issue would have been exacerbated during the halftone process when further degeneration of the image would have occurred. The blue retouching fluid, used to rework the eye and mouth holes of the masking hoods could, therefore, be read as an enhancement of detail carried out to improve the print's copy value. Blue paints were clearly used for such purposes on other areas of the print to add contour detail to the men's clothing and hands, and to the straps of their sandwich boards. The ground was also worked up with a faint shading of blue to separate their dark-toned clothing from the gray tones of the street.

77 

On the other hand, the eyes and mouths painted on to the masking hoods may also be considered as visual information applied to subtly augment this photograph's news value, as this retouching work also enhances the image's ability to convey a strong narrative. The faces, now more prominent, highlight the photograph's human element. In contrast to Czechoslovakia's training in national defense, discussed in Chapter 1, where unretouched gas masks were used to deduce that the retouching work was done to retain copy value, in this case the rendering suggests that visual information, unlikely to have been captured on the photographic negative, may have been added to the print. Applied in the form of lines and dots overtop of the hoods, in much the same way that a stick figure's face is drawn, the overly-simplistic treatment flags this editing job as perhaps untrue to the visual information underneath. However, while this handwork appears to have formed a series of unnatural expressions on the workers' faces, such an assumption is not verifiable without a comparison with the published version of the print. Although locating this image in the Sunday Dispatch confirmed that it was published as a lone photographic illustration (accompanied by the cutline adhered to its verso), working from a fourth generation copy of the newspaper page precludes an accurate assessment of the retouching work in question.166 Having lost all detail and tonal range during the microfilm to photocopy to digital scan process, the row of striking men are barely distinguishable as human figures, in contrast to U.S. Hockey team loses to Canadians, where the painted-on hockey puck remained visible throughout this same copying process. Nevertheless, judging the original retouched print against the degenerated newspaper copy, where the figures' heads appear only as black triangles, one can note a lessening in narrative strength when their facial expressions are no longer present.                                                         
166

Access to the published image was only possible through a fourth-generation digital scan created from a third-generation photocopy of microfilm -- itself a facsimile of the original newspaper held at the British Library, London, England.

 

78 

Without so much as a glimpse of the protestors' visages, they appear not as living, breathing people but as a series of ghostly shapes, which, in addition, one might conclude was a technical flaw in the photograph. Although the textual cutline clarifies that the protestors are shrouded to prevent identification, it would seem that the picture editor saw a need for the addition of just the slightest amount of facial detail to tweak reader interest in the image. While the degree to which Eastbourne hotel workers protesting's news value was adapted to the picture editor's needs may remain uncertain, one can see that deliberate editorial steps were taken before the image went to print. Whether for copy value, news value or both, visual information was added to this photograph to enhance its ability to disseminate a specific pictorial story with visual strength and narrative efficiency.

5.b

Retouching to Remove Visual Information The retouching work done to "Stay in strike." A miner receiving a kiss

(BPAC Print 315, Keystone View Company, 1935) shows how the technique of washing over of a background with retouching fluid was employed to enhance news value by removing unwanted visual information (fig. 40). In addition, by extracting the subjects from their context, this approach allowed the picture editor to create from this photograph the precise news story required at a given moment. This 10 x 12 inch gelatin silver photograph is on the larger end of suggested sizes for press prints during the 1930s, which generally ranged from 8 x 10 inches to 11 x 14 inches, with larger prints working best to facilitate retouching applications.167 While the Daily Mirror's date stamp,168 "D.M .18 OCT 1935," which dots the verso in red ink, suggests that this photograph was published, it was not found in this edition of the

Whether the man and woman were posing for this shot or were caught candidly, the couple was photographed standing in front of a crowd. A thick circular coating of white retouching fluid was therefore employed to eliminate these background folk. The faint spray noticeable at the edges of the application implies that the work was done with an airbrush. A circle drawn on the print verso in graphite corresponds to the retouching done to the recto, suggesting that this photograph was to be cropped in a circular shape, termed "fancy" cropping.170

This photograph was not found in the October 18, 1935 edition of the Daily Mirror available on UKPressOnline. 170 By 1939 fancy cropping was considered poor practice as it took away from a photograph's visual impact. Vitray, Mills, Ellard, 143.

As explained in Pictorial Journalism, washing over a background with a single shade of fluid had specific illustrative uses, but was not without aesthetic drawbacks:

Washing over the whole background with white or black paint so as to obliterate it completely is a good plan with some pictures, particularly those where the background is unimportant to the story the picture has to tell yet is so full of detail that it distracts the eye from the faces or figures in the foreground. Candid-camera shots of men in public life are often handled in this way. There is, however, a certain harshness to the plain background. If too many pictures in the same paper use it, the whole is apt to seem characterless and crude.171

Areas of the print at the outer edges of the airbrushed circle reveal that the background crowd was itself rather expressive. As noted in the above quotation, such extraneous visual information may have competed or perhaps conflicted with the story told by the main subjects and as such was removed from the equation. In addition, because the washed over background detaches the couple from any sort of contextual setting, the photograph, now more generalized, could have been used to illustrate any strike in any place at any time or, just as easily, an alternate news story unrelated to labour troubles. In comparison to Eastbourne hotel workers protesting, this photograph does not feature a picket line, but a woman kissing a man on the cheek. The only indication that a worker's strike was at play is the handwritten text on the print verso, which may or may not be authentic to the circumstances of the original photograph. By over-working the photograph's background, the picture editor turned this image into a pliable resource. Whether or not "Stay in strike." A miner receiving a kiss was published, this object wears the marks of a particular retouching technique in use during the 1930s.

technique is best understood as one of the many editorial tools employed to retouch press photographs for news value. The retouching work done to Young riflemen (BPAC Print 243, Daily Mail, 1934, 6 x 8 inches) demonstrates a variant technical and illustrative intervention related to this same approach. In this instance, the editing out of background objects and people strengthens the specific event captured on film, rather than merely de-contextualizing it (fig. 42). In addition, by applying varying tones of blue fluid, the picture editor avoided the "characterless and crude"172 aesthetic of the white over-wash applied to "Stay in strike." A miner receiving a kiss. Competing verso stamps suggest that the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror may both have published this photograph. The verso is copyright stamped by the Daily Mail and date stamped by the Daily Mirror: "D.M. 28 DEC 1934" (fig. 43). As noted in The Complete Press Photographer, publishing a photograph in more than one newspaper was common. Because this news story is one of general interest -- hardly a picture scoop -- Young riflemen was likely taken by a Daily Mail staff photographer and sold to the Daily Mirror for additional use.173 The cutline adhered to this print's verso is type-set on the diagonal. Having been clipped from a newspaper, one can note the fragment of a hairline rule visible in the top right corner. When magnified this black line reveals a series of halftone dots. The text reads:

Young riflemen trying their skill beside the "Daily Mail" Silver Cup at the range in New Horticultural Hall, Westminster, Where the Schoolboys' Own Exhibition has just opened.

A handwritten cutline applied in graphite on to the verso, "Schoolboys [illeg] The Daily Mail Cup, which they shot for -- at the schoolboys own rifle range," is shorter and less descriptive, suggesting that the published text was rewritten to elucidate the news story told by the image. The photograph features three schoolboys at a rifle range; a woman stands behind them supervising the target practice. As suggested by the typed cutline, which promotes the event as one of public fanfare, the photographer would have had ample time to take this shot which, as a result, is well focused and properly exposed. Blue fluids, applied lightly to add highlights and clarity of detail to the subjects, would have ensured the print's effective transition into a halftone cut. However, in composing this photograph to capture the boys at an angle, which would point their rifles horizontally in a rightward direction across the frame, the photographer included extraneous background information in the shot. From the unretouched area at the top of the background (which was certainly to be cropped out), one can see that objects, people and the rifle range facilities, all similar in tonality to the main subjects, were thickly overlaid with blue-gray fluids.174 This handwork created a clean, simple background whose tones and shapes no longer conflict with the persons at hand or the activity they are engaged in. As noted in Pictorial Journalism, visual simplicity equaled better narrative clarity: "The purpose of washing out the background is to obliterate confusing detail: furniture and ornaments, foliage on a tree, background details."175 Furthermore, because the retoucher subtlety reapplied tonality to the background by using various shades of blue-gray paint, the picture editor avoided the starkness of the white over-wash applied to "Stay in strike." A miner receiving a kiss. As

explained by Vitray, Mills and Ellard, this other technique was seemingly less austere as it worked with, rather than against, the image captured on film:

Sometimes a gray background is preferable, and occasionally the background may be made with light on one side, shading to dark on the other, following the original lighting of the photograph.176

Notably, however, the rifle support bench in the foreground of this image -- itself retouched with blue fluid to correspond in tonality with the painted over background -- retains the photograph's place of origin. Where "Stay in strike." A miner receiving a kiss did not feature any such anchoring visual clues and thus its context was buried underneath the overlay of retouching fluid, the apparent objective with Young riflemen was not to remove the boys from the range facilities, but to make them more clearly visible within it. Just as Young riflemen's cutline was rewritten to be more descriptive upon publication, retouching ensured the delivery of a concise photographic illustration unaffected by an overabundance of visually conflicting subject matter. Although this photograph's background was edited out, the retouching work does not de-contextualize the news story at play, as the photograph's location was not eliminated along with the deleted information. Rather, with less to distract the eye, readers of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror would have focused their attention solely on the main subjects and the activities underway at the rifle range. As exemplified by Expert buyers examining silver fox pelts (BPAC Print 201, Alfieri Picture Service, 1934), the process of retouching to remove visual information can also be paired with aesthetic efficiency. Utilizing aesthetics as an illustrative and communicative tool, the retoucher added contrast and carefully rendered tonality to this

photograph while editing out a visually dull warehouse floor. In turn, this visual rendering up enhanced the image's escapist value (fig. 44).177 Expert buyers examining silver fox pelts is an 8 x 10 inch gelatin silver photograph copyright stamped by the Alfieri Picture Service and date stamped by the Daily Mirror: "DM 24 APR 1934."178 Although a search through the Daily Mirror was inconclusive, it is unlikely that such meticulous retouching work would have been carried out if the print was not slated for publication. In this regard, "[illeg] NP Early," handwritten on the verso, may indicate that the image was not printed in the early run of that day's paper. Reaffirming the probability that this photograph was published, the verso cutline is laid out with hairline rules above and below the text (fig. 45). It reads: Expert buyers examining silver fox pelts before the opening at Beaver House, E.C yesterday of the spring fur sale of the Hudson's Bay Company.

The photograph shows men inspecting fox pelts in a warehouse, captured studiously examining their stock. Lined up in two opposite facing rows with furs hanging to their left and right, the men are placed in the centre of the image, surrounded by the pelts. The photographer, having positioned himself at an elevated location, used a wide angle lens to compose the frame so that the furs lead into the scene, bringing the viewer into the foreground and carrying the eye to a converging point in the background where the rows of merchandise and inspectors meet. As a result, one has a clear view of the warehouse floor, which has since been edited out -- the floor was over-painted with a range of light to dark shades of blue.

Vitray, Mills, Ellard, 35. 178 A "Duplicate Sent 12.26PM 23 APL 1934 to Manchester" is also stamped on the print verso, suggesting that the photograph was taken a day or more before it was published.

Utmost attention was paid to the treatment of these tonal values, enhancing, or perhaps creating, the effect of light and shadow on this ground area. From several spots where the paintbrush application was slightly too thin, one can note that the retouching work disguises a dull floor too light in value to contrast well with the inspectors and their furs. Thus, by overriding this bland area of the image, the picture editor transformed a drab scene into one of increased visual interest. The dramatic lighting now catches the eye, while the painterly brush strokes of white and light shades of blue applied to the furs augment the shimmering pelts and help them to stand out against the deeper tones of the retouched floor. Having been employed with a keen eye and hand for painting and rendering, the application of retouching fluids to this photograph was certainly undertaken with visual interest in mind. However, the following quotation from Kinkaid's Press Photography suggests that aesthetics would have been utilized to enhance narrative value:

The art editor looks at a print with an eye only for news value, nothing else. A photograph that might be accepted in a salon exhibition will receive a cold reception from the pictorial editor of a newspaper if it does not tell the story or at least part of it. 179

Although Kinkaid's text may prove unjustly divisive in its polarization of salon photography versus news photography (a debate outside the sphere of this thesis topic), the quotation nevertheless illustrates the emphasis placed on news value by the 1930s picture editor. In this regard, the painterly retouching work done to Expert buyers examining silver fox pelts may be understood as a means to a visually illustrative end. By using retouching fluids to enhance the effects of light and shadow, the picture editor and his/her process artist(s) rendered this scene more visually enticing to the

would-be pelt purchaser. In comparison to "Stay in strike." A miner receiving a kiss and Young riflemen, one can also note the degree to which skilled rendering was employed when working over unattractive visual information, turning aesthetics into narrative efficiency and narrative precision into visual news. Furthermore, as these three prints have illustrated, when a photograph brings too much -- or the wrong type of -- visual information to the table, it may require retouching work when used by the print media. Unwanted details, even when attractive on the gelatin silver print, can be problematic to a newspaper's specific editorial needs with regard to narrative clarity and visual interest.

5.c

Retouching, Composition and Page Layout Retouching for news value can also be analyzed in concert with page

layout. With regard to British Troops in Saarbrucken (BPAC Print 242, Planet News, 1934), an analysis of the editorial notations present on this print suggests that retouching was likely carried out to clarify composition and ultimately to enhance the image's narrative strength. However, when compared to a photograph of the same event published by the Daily Mirror, questions arise as to whether these mediations were sufficient. Did British Troops in Saarbrucken remain ill-suited for placement on the newspaper page? Credited to Planet News Ltd., this 10 x 12 inch gelatin silver photograph is marred by a deep vertical fold line (likely a crop indicator) that runs down the left side of the recto, piercing through to the verso where it is visible on the object's right (fig. 4647). A line applied in graphite on the verso several inches from the bottom of the print is accompanied by an arrow, two vertical lines and the word, "off," penciled in twice, thus indicating that this lower area was to be cropped. The verso is also copyright stamped by Planet News and date stamped by the Daily Mirror: "D.M. 24 DEC 1934." Although a different photograph of the same event was found in the London Edition of the Daily Mirror published on that date (fig. 48), the cutline adhered to the BPAC print is centre-

 

89 

aligned, with the fragment of a hairline rule visible in the bottom right corner, suggesting that the piece of text was clipped from a newspaper: BRITISH TROOPS IN SAARBRUCKEN. -- a contingent marching through one of the beflagged streets on the way to their billets.

The British soldiers, photographed marching through Saarbrucken, Germany, are, however, barely distinguishable from a mass of semi-out of focus spectators gathered in the foreground of the image. Without the ability to pose his subjects and with presumably little time to frame the shot, the photographer, although shooting from a slightly elevated position, composed British Troops in Saarbrucken with an overly extended foreground. As a result, there is no separation between the pedestrians and the troops and thus little illustrative clarity to the image. The Nazi and German flags, located in the top half of the print, which hang from buildings well above the people on the streets below, become the focal point of an otherwise difficult to decipher photograph. While the retouching work ends at the vertical fold line that runs down the left side of the print recto, the fluids carry onto the area at the bottom of the photograph also slated for cropping (as per the handwritten notations on the verso). When considering that the other prints analyzed in this study were not retouched outside of their crop marks -- such a practice would waste both time and materials -- it is probable that this photograph went through several rounds of editorial trials and tribulations. It would seem that the image was first cropped down its left side, therefore cutting out the dead space in the top left corner and turning the flags into a graphic frame for the pictured scene. Retouching work was then carried out to emphasize and clarify select areas of the composition: blue fluids add contour detail to the civilians and soldiers in an attempt to separate bodies, one from another. The German and Nazi flags lining the streets are also retouched with blue paint, ensuring their transition into halftone as instantly readable symbols. However, this

 

90 

retouching work may not have been adequate as the object also bears a second set of crop marks, as previously described, which reduce the jam of retouched people present in the image's foreground.

L: Fig. 46. BPAC Print 242, British Troops in Saarbrucken. A contingent marching through one of the beflagged streets on the way to their billets, Planet News, 1934 (recto); R: Fig. 47. BPAC Print 242 (verso)

In comparison, the photograph published in the December 24, 1934 London Edition of the Daily Mirror, was taken from a slightly more elevated position and from the other side of the beflagged boulevard (fig. 48). A well-defined formation of soldiers is seen marching in an uninterrupted diagonal line that begins in the left foreground, running through the centre of the composition and into the right side of the background. Civilians stand across the street and do not obstruct one's view of the British forces. Although Nazi flags are visible hanging from buildings, they are smaller in size and do

 

91 

not overpower the rows of troops and onlookers. The published cutline, however, reaffirms that both photographs depict the same scene: The main British contingent on their arrival at Saarbrucken, marching along the streets lavishly decorated with flags bearing the Nazi swastika.180

Because the published image is composed with such clarity, the news story that it illustrates is easily understood. Therefore, readers would have been able to distinguish this image from the contingent articles on the page, although little physical separation exists between them in the layout. On this page, "Cordon Round Ministry of War: Hitler's Long Vigil," a vague news story involving the movement of German troops in Berlin, Hitler, the Ministry of War, a Christmas tree and "a possible event, which as a matter of fact did not materialize,"181 features the bold headline "MYSTERY TROOP MOVEMENTS IN BERLIN"182 that spans all four columns and is thus laid out atop the photograph featuring the British troops in Saarbrucken. In addition, "6,000 Prisoners Released," placed in the lower half of column two of this same page, cuts directly into the Saarbrucken photograph's bottom right corner, which could also be mistaken as a sign that the text and image are telling of the same story. It would seem from the dense layout of this page that the picture editor required a photograph with clearly defined visual cues -- one that would minimize any chance for confusion between the pictorial news story and these competing texts. In this regard, perhaps the ill-defined composition and ambiguous site lines plaguing British Troops in Saarbrucken remained problematic even after an extensive editing process was carried out. Pictorial Journalism suggests that "the wise editor does not make a layout first and

then try to fit it with pictures."183 Whether or not this was the case, the Daily Mirrorpublished photograph was certainly featured prominently as the largest illustration on page 3 of the London daily. Laid out in the top right corner of the page,184 it begins in the middle of column two, carrying over into columns three and four of the four-column spread. The marching soldiers featured in this scene pull the reader's gaze back and forth between the left foreground and the right background -- and ultimately towards the centre of the newspaper page -- in comparison to the BPAC photograph, whose muddled composition leads the eye to a standstill, quickly losing reader interest, in addition to being less clear about the news story that it was intended to tell. When comparing the retouched BPAC print to the Daily Mirror-published photograph, the layers of retouching and cropping carried out on British Troops in Saarbrucken suggest that the picture editor was trying to elucidate the pictured narrative by clarifying and simplifying its composition. While it remains uncertain which photograph replaced the other in the December 24th 1934 Daily Mirror, and whether or not British Troops in Saarbrucken, the BPAC print, was ever in fact published, the question remains: after all of the retouching and cropping work, was this photograph still too visually confusing for newspaper publication? Although such a question will remain unanswerable until further research at the British Library can be carried out, this example points to a series of editorial steps, which were undertaken with the aim of producing an efficiently laid out newspaper page earmarked by a clearly defined news photograph.

Retouching and Textual Cutlines In addition to page layout, the picture editor was responsible for

overseeing the writing of descriptive texts. The cutline adhered to the verso of A typical woman Blackshirt (BPAC Print 200, Daily Mail, 1934), for example, certainly corresponds with the retouching work done to the photograph's recto. Retouching fluids applied to a featured woman transform her into the "typical woman" described by the verso text, creating a tighter union between words and pictures while enhancing the photograph's news value rating (fig. 49). This object, a 7.5 x 9.5 inch gelatin silver photograph is copyright stamped in black ink by the Daily Mail. A purple date stamp, "23 APR 1934," is present but without a publication's initials, while "D.M. 21/4/1934" is handwritten on the verso in red ink (fig. 50).185 "Women Blackshirts" -- likely a printing slug -- is also noted on the verso, while a cutline adhered to the object reads: "A typical woman Blackshirt photographed at the London headquarters yesterday." Although the type font suggests that this slip of paper was likely clipped from a newspaper page, there are no hairline rules visible to confirm this supposition. Of the three women pictured in this photograph, two are clearly standing before the camera, while the woman in the background is out of focus and only partially included in the frame. The woman posing on the left was heavily retouched and prepared for publication, while the woman on the right was left unretouched and was to be cropped out, as per the two framing marks painted on to the recto underneath the woman on the left. The subject selected for publication is thinner, has a more elaborately coiffed hairdo and a daintier face.

The handwritten date may also read: 27/4/1934 or 29/4/1934. All three editions of the Daily Mirror were searched on UKPressOline; a search through the Daily Mail was not possible.

96 

In what appears to have been an attempt to correlate the woman on the left's appearance with the "typical woman" described in the cutline, the picture editor used the retoucher's background application -- white and bluish-gray retouching fluids applied heavily to the brick-clad wall behind her -- as an opportunity to have her waist slimed and her upper torso and arms reshaped. Her face was also retouched, although only lightly, with black paint used to add contour details to her eyebrows, eyes, nose and mouth (fig. 51).

Fig. 51. BPAC Print 200, Daily Mail, 1934 (recto: detail)

Because retouching was not done in isolation from other editorial tasks, it is important to address these other factors when examining retouching work. As noted by Vitray, Mills and Ellard, sexual appeal was news value,186 and although what exactly constituted a "typical woman" in 1934 would be a separate historical and sociological

discussion -- as would the notion that this photograph captures a mid-1930s instance of Britain's historical (and uncomfortable) ambivalence about Nazi-fascism -- one can certainly see a relationship between the cutline adhered to this print, which makes reference to an emblematic female, and the editorial work done to A typical woman Blackshirt, which does its best to comply with this explanatory text. The retouching work done to Birthday celebrations of Selfridge's (BPAC Print 189, Daily Mail, 1934) can also be analyzed in relation to its cutline. In this case, the painting over of a facial expression adds an element of surprise to a child's face (fig. 52), which corresponds to the written accounts present on the object's verso (fig. 53). However, the Daily Mirror's publication of a similar image (and varying cutline), laid out above a large advertisement, leads one to wonder whether the sale of this ad space disrupted the column slot initially allocated to the pictorial news story (fig. 57). Did such a change in layout prompt the selection of this second photograph and, as such, the adaptation of the image's accompanying text? This 9.75 x 7.75 inch gelatin silver print is copyright stamped by the Daily Mail and date stamped by the Daily Mirror: "D.M. 13 MAR 1934." Two cutlines are present on the verso: one is handwritten in graphite and the other is typed. The penciled-in text emphasizes the crowd's delight:

Birthday Celebrations of Selfridge's. The Robot one of the Biggest Attraction[s] of Selfridges in the Toy Department. George the [illeg] Electric Robot answering questions much to the delight of the crowd. The typed cutline describes an astonishing scene: George, the astonishing mechanical man -- one of the special attractions at Selfridge's. All this week the famous firm is celebrating a quarter of a century's trading.

Although it remains uncertain as to whether the typed cutline was clipped from a newspaper, this text differs from that reproduced underneath the photograph published in the Daily Mirror (fig. 54-55), which makes no reference to astonishment or delight:

Birthday celebrations of Selfridge's and the Daily Mirror-published photograph feature the same crowd of people gathered around the Selfridge's robot. However, the sense of excitement suggested by the BPAC print's cutlines and illuminated by the retouching work on its recto is absent from the newspaper page. In the BPAC photograph a child, captured on the left side of the frame, looks backwards away from the robot and towards the photographer; white and black retouching fluids help to illustrate the expression of great surprise on his/her face by raising and accentuating his/her eyes and eyebrows (fig. 56). However, in the published image, the back of another figure's head obstructs this child's face, and the accompanying cutline does not allude to any such enthusiasm. Rather, the Daily Mirror's text refers to the "busy time"188 had by the robot at the department store's birthday celebration.

The Daily Mirror published the other Selfridge's photograph (fig. 57) as a small illustration, placed in columns two and three of a four column spread, and laid out above a three quarter page Lux Toilet Soap advertisement that boasts a large portrait of Joan Crawford. In addition, it is sandwiched between an unrelated article about divorce and a smaller advertisement for Dr. Wernet's denture powder. At less than one third the size of the Lux slot, was the Selfridge's story treated as secondary to this major feature governing the layout? If cropped for the small space allotted to the story by the Daily Mirror, the child highlighted in the retouched BPAC print would have slid down to the bottom of the frame, becoming less of a focal point. The crowd, largely cropped out, now appears rather thin. As the most visible remaining figures post-cropping would have been mainly grown men gathered in the right side of the frame, Birthday celebrations of Selfridge's would have lost the sense of enchantment suggested by the dense group of spectators and highlighted by the expressive child. In comparison to the BPAC print, which was shot from a left of centre position, the Daily Mirror-published photograph was taken from a slightly right of centre location and from a somewhat lower point of view deeper within the crowd. The image fits well into the two column space, as the denser crowd offers a another angle to be taken up by the textual cutline: the busy time had by all. Was the picture editor, therefore, prompted by the insertion of the Lux advertisement to select this related photograph because it is better suited to the ad-driven layout? In this regard, the picture editor may have been pressed to rework the Selfridge's story from one of wonderment, purported by the BPAC print, to that of the busy event suggested by the published scene. Was the cutline rewritten by the editor to better correspond with the visual cues found in the published photograph or were both textual story lines initially suggested to the editor by the photographer as he/she submitted two similar images?

103 

Because both cutlines present on the verso of Birthday celebrations of Selfridge's, the BPAC print, refer to the astonishment and delight of the crowd, such a narrative was likely taken into consideration during the retouching process. However, this storyline may not have carried through into print, as suggested by the Daily Mirror's publication of a nearly identical photograph accompanied by a cutline that relays a different account of the event. Whether or not it was indeed the sale of a large advertisement space that caused the picture editor to swap both image and accompanying text, these objects, images and words together represent a complex working editorial process as it unfolded and developed. From one pictorial news story to the next, the picture editing process took its direction from the many factors affecting newspaper publication during the 1930s.

As expressed by the Daily Mirror's art editor in Bell's The Complete Press Photographer, press photographs "must be of news interest."189 Therefore, retouching for news value is perhaps best understood not as image manipulation but as one of many editorial techniques employed by the picture editor, whether it be for a daily paper or a weekly edition, to better enable the efficient dissemination of a given news story or event. Once again, a link can be made between editing a cutline to be more expressive, thus captivating as a textual deliverer of news, and retouching a photograph to make it more visually efficient and clear, thus enticing as a news illustration. As this process was hardly done in an editorial vacuum, other aspects of the picture editor's work such as the creation of page layouts and the writing of cutlines, are of vital importance to this discussion as well.

CONCLUSION Studying the uses of photographic retouching by the press during the

1930s provides another research avenue into a topic that is central to the history of photography: modern photojournalism. More specifically, this technique brings one face to face with a less documented figure in this history: the 1930s picture editor, who supervised and influenced this mediatory post-production work. From the research undertaken for this thesis, one learns how photographic retouching, a process technique with the sole purpose of becoming invisible upon publication, has done just that -- buried the picture editor's work along with it. Once published, press photographs bore little trace of the editorial work that went into their making, unless one has access to the original retouched prints with which to make comparisons. As discussed in the last two chapters, an analysis of these retouching techniques brings one to the realization that press photography during the 1930s may have remained in some ways insufficient for use by the print media. Although the advancements made during this period were many, greatly improving the production side of the photographer's work, these technologies did not relieve the picture editor's need for retouching fluids when preparing photographs for reproduction. For example, the flash bulb did not always make for a perfectly exposed image; the Wirephoto network sped up the delivery of visual material but presented picture editors with second generation negatives of reduced quality. Thus, the 1930s newspaper saw a continued need to retouch photographs for copy value before they could be transitioned into halftone cuts. In addition, the BPAC prints analyzed suggest that problems regarding the dissemination of photographs with clearly defined news values also continued during this decade. Retouching techniques, along with other editorial mediations such as the writing of textual cutlines, cropping and page layout, were therefore employed to improve press photographs in this regard as well. Retouching was one of the many "invisible" tools utilized by picture editors to build visual news during this modernizing decade.   105 

However, it should be noted that this thesis is not an exhaustive study, but a preliminary investigation that illustrates the need for further scholarship. It is my hope that the many difficulties encountered during the research stages of this study will be reduced as more museums begin to collect large archives of working press prints, an activity that the AGO and the Ryerson Gallery and Research Centre in Toronto are currently doing. As this thesis has demonstrated, such a research topic is made exponentially more difficult by the necessity to have access to first generation prints and publications (in this instance British daily and weekly newspapers) and, ultimately, to collections that can facilitate comparisons between retouched originals and their published versions. Second, third and fourth generation copies, while useful to some degree, do not allow for sufficient analysis of this particular photographic technique. Burying the picture editor's work underneath the layers of image degeneration caused by microfilm, photocopying and scanning, later generation copies -- the product of policies enforced by libraries that remain text-driven -- can make research into this area virtually impossible. Although working with the AGO's BPAC allowed me unlimited access to a large collection of original press photographs, such was not the case when it came to the newspapers in which they were printed. The AGO's BPAC cataloguing records do not list these publications which, in addition, are not part of the museum's larger holdings. Rather, these newspapers are held at the British Library in London, England, which has yet to create an online archive for its extensive historical print media collection. While certain newspapers, such as the Daily Mirror, are available on UKPressOnline, this private website was not extensive enough for the meticulous research required for this area of research. As such, a number of my research questions remain unanswered. For example, were certain BPAC photographs indeed published in alternate editions of the Daily Mirror and, moreover, were they ever published in the Daily Mail? In this regard, having   106 

access to a single newspaper or agency's complete archive, which holds both retouched photographic prints and original published output would be the optimal collection with which to apply this research -- a project that I hope to undertake at some point in the future. Nevertheless, the BPAC prints amply demonstrate the myriad interventions made to press images during the 1930s as they were transformed from gelatin silver photographs into halftone reproductions. As this process was clearly linked to both copy value and news value, the daily press picture editor supervised the retouching of photographs with visual efficiency in mind, editing image and text together as he/she worked to lay out the newspaper page. Along with the technical and professional advancements made to press photography during the 1930s comes a continuing need for a fuller understanding of this facet of the picture editor's work.
