Abstract
SHOCK-LESS HYPERSONIC INTAKES Master of Engineering, 2012 Seyed Hossein Miri Aerospace Engineering Ryerson University

The accuracy of CFD for simulating hypersonic air intake flow is verified by calculating the flow inside a Busemann type intake. The CFD results are then compared against the "exact" solution for the Busemann intake as calculated from the Taylor-McColl equations for conical flow. The method proposed by G. Emanuel (the Lens Analogy) for generating an intake shape that transforms parallel and uniform hypersonic (freestream) flow isentropically to another parallel and uniform, less hypersonic, flow has been verified by CFD (SOLVER II) simulation, based on Finite Volume Method (FVM). The shock-less (isentropic) nature of the Lens Analogy (LA) flow shapes has been explored at both on and off-design Mach numbers.

The Lens Analogy (LA) method exhibits a limit line (singularity) for low Mach number flows, where the streamlines perform an unrealistic reversal in direction. CFD calculations show no corresponding anomalies.

The first hypersonic X-51 scramjet powered long-duration flights.......that tie atmospheric and space propulsion will begin as early as May 25 at Edwards Air Force Base. According to the article (17 May 2011 issue of Spaceflight Now), scramjet propulsion is the future for spaceflight as even a partially successful test would hasten progress on spacecraft that could launch horizontally. Furthermore, this is "an example of the type of revolutionary propulsion that .....will be needed for future space operations." The article noted that "there is a bright future for a range of scramjet-powered vehicles" and "scramjet development will proceed no matter what happens in the near-term shift to commercial crew and cargo launch to the International Space Station."

Introduction

A flight vehicle that is propelled by air breathing engine derives its benefit from not having to carry the oxidant necessary for burning its fuel. Instead the oxidant is supplied from the air so that any on-board oxidant mass and tankage can be replaced by useful payload. An order of magnitude advantage in operating performance is possible over that of rocket motors [1]. Air breathing engines fall into two main categories: gas turbines and ram-scramjets. Gas turbines have been in use since the Second World War. They are directly responsible for the advance of modern air travel. Their design and engineering development is limited by turbine and combustion chamber's material properties. This has put an upper limit to the speed of gas turbine powered aircraft (Mach 3). Ramjets have an equally long development history but their application has been hampered by their inability to provide static thrust. Once up to speed, they are more efficient than turbojet from supersonic to low hypersonic Mach numbers (2 to 5). In a ramjet fuel is mixed and burned at a subsonic Mach number. The quest for shorter flight times in the atmosphere and velocity increases for boosting payload into the earth's orbit has promoted research and development of the scramjet engine. Its distinctive difference from the ramjet engine is that fuel in its combustor is burned at a supersonic speed (Supersonic Combustion, hence Scramjet). Scramjets operate in the hypersonic flight regime. Turbomachinery-based engines are only efficient at subsonic speeds and around M3­M4, Turbomachinery are no longer useful, and ram-style compression becomes the preferred method. All of the above types of engines consist of an intake, a combustor and a nozzle as is seen in Figure 1.0. The purpose of an intake is to make the freestream air flow acceptable to the combustion process. This requires that the Mach number be reduced, allowing heat addition to occur with the least losses and at the same time increasing the air flow static temperature to

ensure spontaneous fuel ignition. Supersonic intakes are designed to capture and efficiently compress airflow for processing by the remaining portions of a ramjet (or scramjet) engine. A high performance intake is critical to obtaining even minimal scramjet engine performance. For the aerodynamicist, intake design challenges arise from shock losses, boundary layer losses and their interactions, from trade-offs between adequate compression and intake starting, from attainment of sufficient performance at off-design operation and from obtaining stable and predictable as well as tailored flows at on-and off-design conditions. [2]

At supersonic speeds this invariably requires a converging flow passage with an increasing static pressure. Such a positive pressure gradient presents the first design challenge: How to prevent boundary layer detachment. The second challenge is: How to attain started flow in the intake. The third challenge is how to minimize shock and boundary layer losses. Many of these problems are treated in the literature on scramjets. A comprehensive review of scramjets is found in reference [3]. Flow efficiency losses in the intake are caused by presence of a boundary layer on their surfaces. These are unavoidable since surfaces are required to compress the flow. Flow losses are also caused by any shockwave that may occur in the intake flow. Prevention of shock losses requires the use of a carefully shaped intake wall surfaces. These surface shapes being dictated by flight Mach number. It is the purpose of this report to present two intake flows: a) Busemann flow, b) Lens Analogy (LA) flow due to G. Emanuel, both of which are suitable for application in scramjet engines. These are presented for comparison and verification by CFD. First CFD will be used to calculate the flow inside a Busemann intake as predicted by Taylor-McColl equation(s). This will serve to verify the capability of the CFD (SOLVER II) code to simulate an "exact" conical flow. The code will then be applied to the flow in the Lens Analogy (LA) surface to verify that the formulation does provide a transition from an originally uniform flow at the inlet to a final uniform flow at the exit plane and that it does so isentropically.

Future studies could include extending the study to axisymmetric intakes by utilizing the Method of Characteristic (MOC). In addition, real gas effects and boundary layer corrections could be studied in detail for wind tunnel and real scenario applications.

1.0 Intakes
Intakes such as Busemann flow type capture (locate) shockwaves at design locations for a specific range of operating conditions. Other intakes such as those without strong shockwave presence are suggested and the relations for their geometry are defined. A uniform hypersonic flow at a freestream inlet Mach number M1 could be transformed to a different uniform and parallel flow with an exit Mach number M2 without presence of strong shocks and losses. One such surface has been studied and formulations to generate a planar 2D surface have been outlined in reference [4].

Supersonic intakes are generally classified as: External Compression - Internal Compression Mixed Compression - 3D Sidewall Compression - Fixed versus Variable Geometry. Both the axisymmetric Busemann intake and the planar 2-D flow outlined in LA are internal and Streamline-Traced type, where former has conical shock present by design.

2.0 The Busemann Intake
The Busemann flow was first described by A. Busemann [5]. It is also discussed by Courant and Friedrichs [6]. Molder and Szpiro proposed this flow for use as a scramjet intake [7]. The flow is axially and conically symmetric and hence obeys the Taylor-McColl equation for such flows. Any streamtube of the Busemann flow transforms the hypersonic freestream at its entry into a uniform and parallel stream at the exit. The isentropic compression is contained between a Mach cone on the upstream side and a shock cone on the downstream side. The conical shock then turns the flow back to uniform and parallel to the freestream into region (4). The compression and subsequent contraction of the flow from region (1) to the region (3) is accompanied by total pressure losses at the shock. The gas state in front of the conical shock is denoted by (2). The exit flow terminates with a weak conical shock hence the flow is not isentropic and some total pressure losses take place. See Figure 2.0

Figure 2.0

Major sections of a typical Busemann flow [8]

A preferred geometry for a scramjet combustor is a circular cross-section duct because of its superior ability to withstand both heat and pressure loads. Frictional losses are also at a minimum for such a duct since a cylinder has the smallest surface area for a given crosssectional area. This leads to a cylindrical (axially symmetric) geometry as being desirable also for the intake that is attached to the front of the combustor duct. Full Busemann has such a circular cross section.

3.0 Busemann Flow Theory *
Taylor-McColl (T-M) equation (1) in its original mode is shown below. Constant property radials in a Busemann Intake calculated based on Taylor-McColl equations is shown in Figure 3.1.

(1)

The most well-known numerical integration of this equation is for the flow over an axisymmetric cone at zero angle of attack in supersonic flow. Taylor-McColl equations (2) and (3) are arranged in terms of the radial and azimuthal Mach numbers (u, v), see Figure. 3.0:

Starting values: u2, v2 (equations 4 and 5 respectively) and 2 are calculated from the Mach number in front of the shock, M2, and the aerodynamic shock angle, 23.

The T-M streamline equation in spherical coordinates is given by equation (8): dr/d = ru/v (8)

Equation (8) is not coupled to (2) or (3), since r does not appear in (2) or (3), so that it could be integrated separately. It is most convenient to integrate equation (8) alongside (2) and (3).

4.0 Lens Analogy (LA) Intake
A uniform, invisid, shock free flow, at a supersonic Mach number M1, can be transformed downstream into a different uniform supersonic flow at a Mach number M2. This type of flow is reversible and therefore M2 may be larger or smaller than M1. When M2 is larger than M1, we have an expansive nozzle like flow with a favorable pressure gradient. When M2 (>1) is less than M1, the flow is compressive, as in a diffuser, and the pressure gradient is an adverse one. Since the cross-sectional area of the stream is expanded (contracted) if M2 > M1 (M1 > M2), the transformation is conceptually analogous to what several lenses can do with an optical beam; hence, the name lens analogy (LA) [4]. The lens analogy flow consists of joining three simple planar flows in a tandem downstream sequence as shown in Figure 4.0. The two-dimensional LA flow is assumed to be steady, inviscid, shock free and the fluid behaves as a perfect gas. The flows to the left of the line AA' and to the right of the line BB" are parallel and uniform. Flows in regions enclosed by AA'A" and BB'B" are compressive Prandtl-Meyer flows. In region enclosed by AA"B'B the flow converges towards a line sink [4].

Matching Mach number and flow direction at every location on the lines AA" and BB' yields to an explicit analytical expression for the wall shape A'A"B'B" (equations 9, 10, 11 and 12). The line A"B' is straight and can be any length including zero. For a unit intake height the varia bles are: gas specific heat ratio (), M1, M3 and A"B' segment length (dl). Sketch of the lower half of a symmetric two-dimensional LA diffuser is shown in Figure 4.0 and an actual example of a surface generated using  =1.4, M1=3.0 and M2=2.0 is shown in Figure 4.1.

5.0 Limit Lines
Emanuel has shown that below an exit Mach number of 1.37 there exists a singularity or limit line in the streamline shape. A streamline arriving at the limit line reverses direction by 180 o to flow in the opposite (upstream) direction at the exit plane.

Although predicted by analysis, such flow behaviour does not seem physically possible because the flow would have to somehow penetrate itself. However the question still arises as to what happens to the actual flow on the contour of this analytically predicted line. Why does the analytical method fail to produce a continued realistic contour? What would happen experimentally? Does a shockwave occur?

Figure 5.0 shows limit line according to Emanuel and Figures 5.1a-b show same location on a numerically generated surface.

6.0 Busemann vs. Lens Analogy (LA) Intakes.
It is important to compare similarities and differences between intake type flows generated by those two methods. Both methods: a) Transform a uniform and parallel supersonic / hypersonic flow to a lower uniform and parallel flow. b) Both methods depend on using a constant value of gas specific heat ratios: .

The flows differ by: a) Busemann flow is axial. Lens Analogy (LA) flow is planar. b) Busemann flow is also conically symmetric. LA flow has no such additional symmetry. c) LA flow is isentropic, hence reversible. It can be used to generate nozzle contours as well as intake contours. Busemann flow, because of the trailing shock, is irreversible and can be used to generate intake flows only. d) Busemann intake shapes are found numerically from the (Runge-Kutta) integration of a second order Total Differential Equation (The Taylor-McColl equation(s)). No explicit solution exists. The planar LA flow and contour are given by explicit expressions. e) The LA flow definition has one extra variable, the sink-flow length section from A" to B' (dl). This makes it possible to vary the length of the LA. Such variation could be useful to decrease the adverse pressure gradient thereby alleviating boundary layer separation problem. A similar decrease in pressure gradient for the Busemann intake could be attained only by increasing the overall size of the intake.

It is noted that LA is applicable also to axial flows. Such axial flows would be more closely comparable to Busemann flows. The axial flow version involves the use of the Method of Characteristics (MOC). It no longer yields explicit solutions and its application is much more complicated than for planar flow [4].

The study of the axial flow LA is left for a future project.

7.0 The FVM-based CFD Code (SOLVER II) grid file
Work reported herein has been carried out using SOLVER II, an unstructured, time-dependent, solution-adaptive, multi-block, MUSCL-type, Euler code. A numerical method utilizing these features should provide reliable results, so long as the flows being studied are devoid of large zones of separated flow. First and last pages of the grid file for CFD code (SOLVER II) is shown below. This file, containing (x, y) coordinates of the surface points, is required as input to the code that generates the computational grid for the SLOVER II CFD code. It is generated using equations (9) through (21).

First page of the grid file is shown below where mesh parameters are set.

Last Page of the grid file is shown below where boundary conditions are set.

8.0 CFD Code verification
A CFD (SOLVER II) code is used to calculate the flow inside a Busemann intake as predicted by Taylor-McColl equation(s). This will serve to verify the capability of the CFD (SOLVER II) code to simulate an "exact" conical flow. A Busemann surface for freestream Mach number, M1=8.336 and  =1.4 was generated using Molder's QBasic program (see Appendix B). Coordinates were incorporated into the FVM-based SOLVER II and solutions were obtained. Figures 8.0 to 8.5 show the settings and results obtained. A brief discussion of each illustration follows each Figure.
