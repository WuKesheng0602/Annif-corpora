MECHA ICAL PROPERTIES OF FIBER LASER WELDED A D FRICTIO STIR (SPOT) WELDED LIGHTWEIGHT ALLOYS
Mohammed Shafiul Hasib Chowdhury MASc., Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, 2012

ABSTRACT

Mechanical properties of fiber laser welded (FLWed), friction stir welded (FSWed), and friction stir spot welded (FSS weld) AZ31B-H24 Mg and Al 5754 alloys were studied. After welding, grains at the weld centre became recrystallized. -Mg17Al12 particles appeared in the fusion zone of the joints during laser welding, while a characteristic interfacial layer consisting of Al12Mg17 and Al3Mg2 was observed in the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld. In FLWed joints, a joint efficiency of ~91% with superior yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and fatigue strength was achieved at a higher welding speed. In FSWed joints, a higher welding speed of 20 mm/s and lower rotational rate of 1000 rpm led to higher YS, but lower ductility, strain-hardening exponent and hardening capacity. In FSS weld joints, Mg/Mg, Al/Al FSS welds and Al/Mg adhesive, Mg/Al adhesive FSS welds had a significantly higher lap shear strength and fatigue life than the Al/Mg FSS weld.

CHAPTER 1 I TRODUCTIO
As the global resource and environmental problems tend to be increasingly severe in recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the weight reduction of aerospace structures, automotive bodies, and high speed passenger cars in order to improve the fuel economy and reduce the damaging effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [1-8]. To achieve such goals and meet legislative regulations, the manufacturers in the automotive and aerospace sectors have to reduce the vehicle weight via applying advanced lightweight materials [4,5,9-15]. Recently, the development and application of the ultralight-weight magnesium alloys have been significantly increasing in the transportation sectors due to their low density, high strength-toweight ratio, and superior damping capacity [1,9-13,16,17]. In contrast, design and manufacturing with aluminum alloys is longstanding in aerospace and automotive structures and becoming increasingly significant in heavyweight vehicles and high speed passenger rail bodies to take advantage of the light weight and good strength properties [8,18]. The structural application of magnesium and aluminum alloys inevitably involves welding and joining in the manufacturing process, understanding the weldability of magnesium and aluminum alloys plays an essential role in determining the viability of component lightweighting through replacement with magnesium and aluminum alloys. In this regard, mechanical properties such as strength (tensile and fatigue), ductility, strain-hardening behavior, etc., of all welded joints used in structural applications must be evaluated to ensure the integrity and safety of the joint and structure. However, until now, the evaluation of different welded joints in Mg and Al alloys using novel welding techniques in terms of mechanical properties is very limited. Some limited 1

work on the fiber laser welding (FLW) of Mg alloys has recently been reported [19-21]. For the friction stir welding (FSW) of Mg alloys, relatively little attention has been paid as to how the mechanical properties of the FSWed joints change with different processing parameters. On the other hand, the integrity and durability issues of similar Mg and Al friction stir spot (FSS) welds and dissimilar Al-to-Mg FSS welds with and without adhesive especially under cyclic loading have not been systematically studied, and no fatigue behavior for such FSS welds in relation to the change in the failure mode has been reported in the open literature. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate different welded joints of AZ31B Mg alloy and Al 5754-O alloy in terms of microstructural evolution, texture, micro-hardness, tensile properties, strain hardening and fatigue properties. A literature survey is presented in Chapter 2 on Mg and Al alloys and their properties. Basic principles of different welded joints along with the published results of microstructural evaluation, tensile and fatigue properties of the welded joints are also discussed. Chapter 3 gives the experimental procedures involved in this study. Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 present the test results obtained in this thesis work. Microstructural characterization, micro-hardness, tensile and fatigue properties of AZ31B-H24, Al 5754-O and welded joints are presented and analyzed in those four Chapters. Chapter 8 presents summary and future scope of the relevant work.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Magnesium and Its Alloys
Magnesium is rapidly winning recognition as an important engineering material. Practically unknown over 100 years ago, except in the university laboratories, it is now widely accepted in real commercial structural applications. Recent advances have changed magnesium from a laboratory product to an important engineering metal [22]. It is the lightest metal known to processing properties of permanence and stability for structural applications. It has long been a material of fascinating possibilities to engineers, but any commercial application on a large scale was forced to wait upon lower manufacturing costs and the development of high strength alloys. Both of these preliminary steps have now been gradually accomplished. Since 1993, there has been a renewed interest in using magnesium-based alloys in automobile, aerospace and household and sport applications. Their ultra-lightness makes them of particular value in the automotive and aircraft industries [23]. Of the prevalent materials for the next-generation transportation vehicles in the automotive and aerospace industries, magnesium alloys represent a lucrative option for the weight reduction owing to their low density, high strength-to-weight ratio, environmental friendliness, castability and recyclability [24].

2.2 Aluminum and Its Alloys
In the last century, aluminum became the most widely used metal after iron. This dramatic rise to prominence is a result of the qualities of the aluminum and its alloys as well as its economic

3

advantages [25].The principal characteristic of aluminum is its low density, being second only to magnesium, and, for this reason, it is especially valuable for the aircraft and automotive industries. Aluminum would be ideal if this lightness could be combined with the mechanical properties of the ferrous metals [26]. Although pure aluminum only possesses a low strength which prohibits its use for articles subjected to great stresses but its mechanical properties can be improved by the addition of other constituents, and in some of the alloys formed the density has a slight change. These are the so-called light alloys, in which aluminum is a main constituent. The most significant properties of these alloys are: high strength to weight ratio, easier fabrication, corrosion resistance, high electrical and thermal conductivity, high toughness at cryogenic temperatures, reflectivity, non-toxicity and recyclability.

2.3 Physical Metallurgy and Properties
Magnesium and aluminum alloys have been employed in a wide variety of structural applications because of their favorable combination of tensile strength, elastic modulus and low density. Both magnesium and aluminum alloys have high strength-to-weight ratios and relatively good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. Both magnesium and aluminum are silvery white metals. Table 2-1 shows the physical properties of magnesium and aluminum compared to the other structural materials. In comparison, the density of magnesium is less than one quarter that of iron and two-thirds that of aluminum. The melting point and specific heat of magnesium are almost the same as those of aluminum. The Young's modulus and shear modulus of magnesium are about two-thirds of those of aluminum. Another aspect of magnesium is its good damping behavior. Pure magnesium shows even higher

2.4 Types of Magnesium and Aluminum Alloys
For the materials where alloying can significantly enhance strength for structural purposes, for practical design different types of magnesium and aluminum alloys are usually used:

5

-Magnesium alloys: Aluminum is the most commonly used alloying element and forms the basis of the die casting magnesium alloys. Maximum solubility of Al in magnesium is 12.7 wt % and alloys in excess of 6 wt % can be heat treated. Aluminum improves strength, with an optimum combination of strength and ductility being observed at about 6%. The alloys are readily castable [23]. Zinc is used as an alloying element to increase the strength of the magnesium alloys by solid solution and precipitation. However, it reduces the ductility of the Mg alloys [28]. Manganese is usually not employed alone but with other elements, e.g., Al. In this case, compounds such as MnAl, MnAl6 or MnAl4 are formed. Mn reduces the solubility of iron and produces relatively safe compounds. It increases the yield strength and improves salt water corrosion resistance of Mg-Al and Mg-Al-Zn alloys. Binary alloys are used in forgings or extruded bars. The maximum amount of manganese is 1.5-2.0 wt %. [23]. Till now, the main fabrication route of magnesium alloy parts remains die-casting because of its high productivity and dimensional accuracy. It is well known that wrought magnesium alloys have superior mechanical properties than cast alloys. Often these superior properties are attained through hot working such as rolling, forging and extrusion during which the grains are greatly refined. -Aluminum alloys: The main alloying elements are copper, zinc, magnesium, silicon, manganese and lithium. The primary alloying elements and the properties of the resulting wrought alloys are listed below [26]: 1xxx: This series is for commercially pure aluminum, defined in the industry as being at least 99% aluminum. 2xxx: The primary alloying element for this group is copper, which produces high strength but reduced corrosion resistance. 3xxx: Manganese is the main alloying element for the 3xxx series, increasing the strength of unalloyed aluminum by about 20%. 4xxx: Silicon is added to alloys of the 4xxx series to reduce the melting point for welding and brazing 6

applications. 5xxx: The 5xxx series is produced by adding magnesium, resulting in strong, corrosion-resistant, high-welded-strength alloys. The strength of alloys in this series is directly proportional to the magnesium content, which ranges up to about 6%. 6xxx: Alloys in this group contain magnesium and silicon in proportions that form magnesium silicide (Mg2Si). These alloys have a good balance of corrosion resistance and strength. 6061 is one of the most popular of all aluminum alloys, and it has yield strength comparable to mild carbon steel. 7xxx: The primary alloying element of this series is zinc. The alloys of this group include the strongest aluminum alloy, 7178, which has a minimum tensile ultimate strength of 84 ksi (580 MPa), and are used in aircraft frames and structural components. Casting alloys contain larger proportions of alloying elements than wrought alloys. This results in a heterogeneous structure, which is generally less ductile than the more homogeneous structure of the wrought alloys. Cast alloys also contain more silicon than wrought alloys to provide the fluidity necessary to make a casting [26].

2.5 Friction Stir Welding
Friction stir welding (FSW) is a green solid-state joining process and is used for applications where the original metal characteristics must remain unchanged as far as possible. It was invented and experimentally proven by Wayne Thomas and a team of his colleagues at The Welding Institute, UK in December 1991 [29]. Fig. 2.1 presents a schematic of the FSW process. In this process, a cylindrical-shouldered tool, with a profiled threaded/unthreaded probe (nib or pin) is rotated at a constant speed and fed at a constant traverse/welding speed into the joint line between two pieces of sheet or plate material, which are butted together. The parts have to be clamped rigidly onto a backing bar in a manner that prevents the abutting joint faces from being

7

forced apart. The length of the nib is slightly less than the weld depth required and the tool shoulder should be in intimate contact with the work surface. The nib is then moved against the work, or vice versa. Frictional heat is generated between the wear-resistant welding tool shoulder and nib, and the material of the work pieces. This heat, along with the heat generated by the mechanical mixing process and the adiabatic heat within the material, cause the stirred materials to soften without reaching the melting point, allowing the traversing of the tool along the weld line in a plasticized tubular shaft of metal. As the pin is moved in the direction of welding, the leading face of the pin, assisted by a special pin profile, forces plasticized material to the back of the pin while applying a substantial forging force to consolidate the weld metal. The welding of the material is facilitated by severe plastic deformation in the solid state, involving dynamic recrystallization of the base material [30].

The total energy generated per unit length of the weld is the sum of the energy generated due to friction between the tool and the workpiece surface and the plastic deformation within the workpiece. Thus, the total energy generated during FSW can be expressed as follows [30],

where µ is the coefficient of friction, F is the compressive force, ro is the radius of the shoulder, ri is the radius of the pin, h is the height of the pin,  is the tool angular velocity in rpm (rev/min), vo is the welding speed, s is a scale factor,  is the effective stress and  is the effective strain. In Chapter 5 the effect of heat input along with transverse speed  and welding speed vo are discussed in detail.

2.6 Fiber Laser Welding
Fiber laser welding, first used in materials processing in 2000 [31], is best employed for keyhole welding. The laser is finely focused so as to achieve a very high power density (typically at least 1 MW/cm2) at the work piece. At the center of the focused beam, metal actually vaporizes, opening up a blind keyhole into the molten metal pool. Vapor pressure holds back the surrounding molten metal and keeps this keyhole open during the process. This metal vapor also re-radiates laser energy into the molten metal along the side of the keyhole, thus transferring energy through the entire depth of the keyhole and resulting in a weld with a deep aspect ratio. The small size of keyhole region results in a relatively small fusion zone (FZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ). Furthermore, the highly localized application of heat means that the work piece both heats up and cools down rapidly which can minimize grain growth in high strength low alloy steels (HSLA). Even though no filler material is typically used in keyhole welding, the high 9

temperatures of keyhole welding can vaporize volatile materials, producing a different composition in the fusion zone than in the base metal [31]. Fig 2.2 presents a schematic of the fiber laser welding process.

2.7 Friction Stir Spot Welding
In 1993, based on the linear friction stir welding (FSW), Mazda Corporation of Japan proposed a friction stir spot welding (FSSW) process which has successfully been applied to the production of hood and rear door of the sport vehicle Mazda RX-8 [8]. For aluminum and magnesium alloys, the conventional resistance spot welding process poses some technical issues, including weld porosity, electrode wear, high energy consumption, low production efficiency, and inconsistency in failure modes [33-38]. Therefore, the automotive industry is on the lookout for some alternative and relatively new methods, such as structural adhesives, rivets, and togglelocks, to join aluminum and magnesium sheets. The FSSW process provides a potential solution in terms of joint strength performance, weld quality, and operation cost without adding extraweight [34]. A schematic illustration of the FSSW process is shown in Fig.2.3, where 10

FSSW process is applied to a lap joint consisting of upper and lower sheets. A rotating tool with a probe is plunged into the material from the top surface for a certain time to generate frictional heat. At the same time, a backing plate contracts the lower sheet from the bottom side to support the downward force. Heated and softened material adjacent to the tool causes plastic flow. In addition, the tool shoulder gives a strong compressive force to the material. After the tool is drawn away from the material, a solid phase is made between the upper and lower sheets [39].

2.8 Previous Studies
A lot of studies on the fusion welding of Mg alloys have been reported. Weisheit et al. [40] performed CO2 laser welding of different Mg alloys and showed that most Mg alloys can be easily welded without serious defects, except AZ series and AM series which exhibited extremely high levels of porosity. Zhao and Debroy [41] investigated the formation of porosity in an AM60 Mg alloy during laser welding and concluded that hydrogen in the parent material was the main origin of porosity in the welds. Sun et al. [42] evaluated TIG, CO2 and pulsed Nd:YAG laser welded joints of AZ31 sheet and reported that TIG welding could be used to

11

achieve welds without defects, but noted that coarser grain sizes in TIG welds could diminish the mechanical properties. Quan et al. [43] studied the effects of heat input on microstructure and tensile properties of a laser welded AZ31 Mg alloy. Liu and Dong [44] reported the effect of microstructural changes on the tensile properties of a non-autogenous gas tungsten arc welded AZ31 magnesium alloy. Zhu et al. [45] presented the effect of welding parameters on the welding defects and microstructural evolution in CO2 and diode laser welded AZ31 magnesium alloy.

Recently, among the several types of lasers, attention has been paid to fiber lasers, because this type of lasers presents a number of benefits for industrial applications, namely high power with small beam divergence, flexible beam delivery, low maintenance costs, high efficiency of laser generation and compact size of laser apparatus [46]. Limited work on the fiber laser welding (FLW) of Mg alloys has recently been reported. Sakai et al. [19] conducted welding on a 2 mm thick extruded sheet of Mg-6Al-2Ca alloy at a welding speed of 10 m/min using a 3 kW fiber laser, and obtained the tensile strength of welded joints reaching about 84~88% of that of the base metal. Liu et al. [20] also performed welding of an ACM522 Mg alloy using a fiber laser and showed that sound welds without major defects could be achieved. However, porosity in the fiber laser welds of two thixomolded Mg alloys AE42 and AS41 occurred, and the volume fraction of porosity in the welds decreased with increasing welding speed [21]. A lot of studies on the FSW of magnesium alloys have been reported, including microstructural evaluation [4752] and tensile properties [47,50,53-59] in relation to the welding parameters. Some earlier results on the microstructural changes and strength of various FSWed magnesium alloys have been well documented in references [60-63]. Several authors have studied the strain hardening

12

behavior of magnesium alloys with emphasis on the relationship between the grain size strengthening and dislocation strain hardening of the material [58,64-67].The progressive developments in electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) over the last decade or so have promoted research work on the microtexture of FSWed materials [62,68,69]. By analyzing X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Chang et al. [70] studied the grain orientation of FSWed AZ31 and found that the tool rotational rate played an important role in the orientation of the basal plane (0002). Park et al. [62] reported that the development of the texture was due to the basal slip (0002)<11 2 0> , which was favored over prismatic or pyramidal slip at the room temperature, and the strain rates during plastic deformation.

On the other hand, a number of papers on the joining of Mg and Al alloys using FSSW have recently been reported [8,18,71,72], only limited studies have been done on lap shear strength and especially fatigue resistance of the FSSW joints, a topic of vital importance for the safe and reliable applications. With regards to FSS welds made of similar Al alloys, the failure modes at quasi-static and cyclic loads vary with loading type. Lin et al. [73] observed some differences in the fracture path between quasi-static loads and fatigue loads for AA6111-T4 alloy. Latabhai et al. [74] indicated that the shear strength first increased and then decreased with increasing tool rotational rate for AA6061-T5 FSSW joints, while Tozaki et al. [75] reported that the tensile shear strength monotonically increased with increasing tool rotational rate. Mallick and Agarwal [76] evaluated the fatigue performance of FSS welds made of AM60 and AA 5754 alloys but the failure mechanisms were not studied in detail. FSS welds of dissimilar Al and Mg alloys were observed to exhibit different failure modes compared with those with identical alloys for both top and bottom sheets [18,71,77]. Recently, some new kinds of hybrid welding techniques have been

13

used to join dissimilar Al-to-Mg alloys, such as laser adhesive welding [15,78-80]. Liu and Ren [78] indicated that the lap shear strength increased in the MIG spot adhesive welded AZ31B to Al 6061 joints, while Wang et al. [15] found that the addition of the adhesive increased the weld penetration depth in the Al alloy side for Nd:YAG laser adhesive welds of dissimilar Mg-to-Al alloys.

2.9 Research Objectives
Based on the above literature survey, it is clear that a suitable welding method for Mg and Al alloy has not yet been fully established. The fatigue properties are critical in design considerations as the automotive and aerospace components are inevitably subjected to dynamic or cyclic stresses in service; however, no or very limited studies of fatigue behavior of fiber laser welded (FLWed) Mg joints, friction stir spot welded (FSS welds) and friction stir spot adhesive welded Mg and Al joints were reported in the open literature. Thus, the aim of the present investigation was to: · Evaluate the microstructure, tensile properties, strain hardening, and fatigue properties of fiber laser welded AZ31B Mg alloy sheet with particular focus on the effect of welding speed. · Identify the effect of welding parameters on the microstructure, texture and mechanical properties of friction stir welded AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy sheets. · Determine the lap shear strength and fatigue resistance of the friction stir spot welded similar AZ31B-H24 and AA5754-O alloy, and dissimilar AZ31-to-AA5754 alloy joints. · Evaluate the lap shear strength and fatigue resistance of the friction stir spot adhesive welded AZ31B-H24 alloy to AA5754-O alloy and compare the results with those of the dissimilar AZ31-to-AA5754 alloy joints.

CHAPTER 3 MATERIALS A D EXPERIME TAL PROCEDURE

3.1 Materials and Composition
AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy and Al 5754-O Al alloy were selected in this study. The AZ31B Mg alloy material for fiber laser welding was provided by General Motors Research and Development Center (GM R&D) through the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The chemical composition of the alloy is listed in Table 3-1.

Three different types of welding, namely, friction stir welding (FSW), friction stir spot welding (FSSW) with or without adhesive, and fiber laser welding (FLW) were employed to make autogenous welds between the work-pieces in the butt and lap joint configurations. All welded joints were made with the welding direction perpendicular to the rolling direction of the sheet. Prior to welding, surface oxides were removed with a steel brush and then the surface was cleaned using ethanol as well. The welding parameters for those welding methods are listed in Table 3-3. In addition, for the friction stir spot adhesive weld, Mg and Al alloy sheets were cut into small coupons of 35 mm × 100 mm with the loading axis along the rolling direction. Two coupons were overlaid over an area of 35 mm × 35 mm between which Terokal 5089 adhesive had been applied and cured at a temperature of 170°C for 20 min. FSSW was then performed at the centre of the overlapped area.

3.2 Sample Preparation and Testing
The experimental tests were conducted and metallographic sample were prepared in the laboratories of Mechanical Engineering Department at Ryerson University.

3.2.1 Metallography
All metallographic samples for microstructural characterization were taken from the cross section perpendicular to the welding direction and were cold mounted using Lecoset 7007 resin (mixing ratio: 2 parts of resin added to 1 part of catalyst). The mounted samples were manually ground with SiC papers up to a grit of #1200 with water as the lubricant and then polished with 6 µm, 3 µm, and 1 µm diamond paste followed by 0.5 µm finer MasterPrep solution. The polishing 17

lubricant for the diamond paste was a mixture of rust inhibiting solution and distilled water (10% solution by volume). Due to the reactive nature of magnesium in the presence of water, ethanol was used as a cleaning agent during the polishing stages. Two etchants were used individually etchant 1: acetic picral (10 ml acetic acid (99%), 4.2 g picric acid, 10 ml H2O, 70 ml ethanol (95%)) for Mg alloy, and etchant 2: Keller's reagent (2.5 ml nitric acid, 1.5 ml hydrochloric acid, 1 ml hydrofluoric acid and 100 ml distilled water) for Al alloy.

3.2.2 Quantitative Image Analysis
Microscopic images were taken using a light microscope and image analysis was subsequently performed using Clemex software to obtain the grain size. The Clemex image analysis system was composed of Clemex CMT software adaptable to ASTM standards, a Nikon optical microscope (10× eye piece, five different object lenses with magnifications of 5×, 10×, 20×, 40×, and 100×), a high-resolution digital camera, and a high performance computer to carry out the detailed analysis.

3.2.3 Microhardness Tests
A computerized Buehler microhardness testing machine was used for the micro-indentation hardness tests where a load of 100 g and duration of 15 s were used. The test results were recorded in the computer using a Hyper Terminal. Vickers microhardness tests were performed on the unetched samples. All the indentations were adequately spaced to avoid any potential effect of strain fields caused by adjacent indentations.

18

3.2.4 Tensile Tests
All butt joint samples for tensile tests were prepared according to the ASTM E8M standard [81] using sub-sized sheet type specimens (i.e., a gauge length of 25 mm and a gauge width of 6 mm). The specimen dimensions are shown in Fig Fig. 3.1. All samples for the tensile tests were taken parallel to the rolling direction, , with the weld positioned in the middle of the specimens. The tests were carried out using a computerized United testing machine at four different strain rates: 1×10-2 s-1, 1×10-3 s-1, 1×10-4 s-1 and 1×10-5 s-1. Lap shear tensile tests were conducted using the lap joint samples at a crosshead displa displacement speed of 10 mm/min. All the tests were conducted at room temperature.

3.2.5 Fatigue Tests
Fatigue tests were performed using a fully computerized servo-hydraulic Instron 8801 fatigue testing system. The butt joint samples for fatigue tests were similar to the tensile testing samples, as shown in Fig. 3.1. The tests were carried out in a load control mode at different stress amplitudes. A stress ratio of R (min/max) equal to 0.1, sinusoidal waveform, and frequency of 50 Hz were selected in all the tests. Fatigue tests for the lap joint samples were carried out using similar testing system under load control. A load ratio of R=0.2, sinusoidal waveform, and a frequency of 50 Hz were applied in all the tests. At least two samples were tested at each stress or load level. The fracture surfaces of the welded joints after fatigue tests were examined via a JSM-6380LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with Oxford energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) system and three-dimensional (3D) fractographic analysis capacity.

3.2.6 X-ray Diffraction Tests
A multi-functional PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer was used to identify the formation of phases in the fusion zone, heat-affected zone of the FLWed samples and intermetallic compounds in the dissimilar Al-to-Mg FSS welds from the fracture surface (both Mg side and Al side) after fatigue tests. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using CuK radiation (wavelength =0.15406 nm) at 45 kV and 40 mA. The diffraction angle (2) at which the X-rays hit the sample varied from 20° to 110° with a step size of 0.05-0.2° and 3-10 s in each step. Furthermore, crystallographic texture of the FSWed specimens was measured by XRD using CuK radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA as well, with a sample tilt angle ranging from 0 to 70°. The specimens for the pole figure measurements were mounted on the XRD sample stage in such an orientation that the sheet rolling direction (RD) was always parallel to the X-axis of the 20

sample stage. The pole figures were measured and analyzed by `X-pert texture' software, where the results were represented as (0002), (10 10), and (10 11) color-scale intensity poles.

CHAPTER 4
FIBER LASER WELDED AZ31 MAG ESIUM ALLOY: EFFECT OF WELDI G SPEED O MICROSTRUCTURE A D MECHA ICAL PROPERTIES

4.1 Microstructure
Typical microstructures of AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy base metal and fiber laser welded joints are shown in Fig. 4.1 for a welding speed of 50 mm/s and Fig. 4.2 for a welding speed of 100 mm/s, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4.1(a), elongated and pancake-shaped grains with varying sizes were observed in the base metal. The heterogeneity in the grain structure of the base metal was due to both deformation of the 2 mm thick sheet by rolling and incomplete dynamic recrystallization (partial annealing). A similar result has been reported for AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy in [53]. Laser welding led to a considerable change in the microstructure. Due to the high power density in fiber laser welding that led to a deep and narrow fusion zone, the weld bead was fairly narrow at both the top and bottom and no distortion or drop-through was observed across the weld (Fig.4.1(b)). However, the lower welding speed of 50 mm/s resulted in a slightly wider fusion zone (Fig. 4.1(b)), in comparison with that of the welded joint made at a welding speed of 100 mm/s (Fig. 4.2(a)). This was due to the higher energy input at the lower welding speed. The fusion zone exhibited typical equiaxed dendritic structures in both welding conditions, containing a large number of divorced eutectic -Mg17Al12 precipitates existing basically in the interdendritic and intergranular regions (Fig. 4.1(c) and Fig. 4.2(b)). Such divorced eutectic Mg17Al12 precipitates only appeared in the fusion zone, as revealed by the XRD micro-diffraction 22

(Fig. 4.3). The presence of the eutectic structure was due to the non-equilibrium rapid cooling of the weld pool during welding. Such -Mg17Al12 precipitates were also observed in the fusion zone of diode laser [82], laser/arc hybrid [83], double-sided arc [84], and resistance spot welded [85] Mg joints. However, the grain size (or dendrite cell size) in the fusion zone appeared larger at a lower welding speed of 50 mm/s (Fig. 4.1(c)) than at a higher welding speed of 100 mm/s (Fig. 4.2(b)). As the fiber laser welded joint at a welding speed of 50 mm/s had more heat energy deposited in the welding area and a lower cooling rate, the temperature in the fusion zone would be expected to be higher [86]. This would result in larger sizes of equiaxed dendrite cells along with a relatively fewer divorced eutectic -Mg17Al12 precipitates formed in the fusion zone, in comparison with the fiber laser welded joint at a welding speed of 100 mm/s, as shown inFig.4.1(d) and Fig. 4.2(c) taken at a higher magnification. A similar effect of welding speed on the dendrite cell sizes in the fusion zone in a CO2 laser welded AZ31 magnesium alloy joint was reported in [87] as well. It was reported that the higher the casting temperature (or pouring temperature during casting), the larger the dendrite cell/grain size and the secondary dendrite arm spacing were for aluminum alloys [88,89] and a superalloy [90]. Gilath et al. [91] proposed the following expression,

d=

C v
,

(4.1)

Where d is the dendrite spacing, v is the welding speed, and C is an empirical constant. Based on the above equation, a larger dendrite cell/grain size should be observed in the fusion zone at the lower welding speed of 50 mm/s.

23

Near the fusion boundary, columnar dendrites formed in both welded joints (Fig. 4.1(e) and 4.2(d)). The width of columnar dendrite zone (CDZ) increased with decreasing welding speed from 100 mm/s to 50 mm/s (Fig. 4.1(e) and Fig.4.2(d)), respectively. Similar results have been reported in [43]. The formation of columnar dendrites was due to the presence of a larger temperature gradient near the fusion boundary than in the weld pool center, as reported by Kou [92]. In the heat-affected zone, the originally elongated and partially-deformed base metal structure had become equiaxed grains in both welded joints (Fig. 4.1(f) and 4.2(e)), suggesting that recrystallization and grain growth occurred in the heat-affected zone where no divorced eutectic -Mg17Al12 precipitates were present in contrast to the fusion zone microstructure. This is also visible in from the XRD micro-diffraction spectra shown in Fig.4.3. It is clear that the size of grains in the heat-affected zone was larger at a slower welding speed of 50 mm/s (Fig. 4.1(f)) than at a faster welding speed of 100 mm/s (Fig. 4.2(e)). Again, this was attributed to the higher energy input leading to a higher temperature in the heat-affected zone which sustained a longer time at the slower welding speed. It should be noted that some small pores were observed in the fusion zone, which is more visible on the fracture surface in the later section.

Some particles were also seen in the fiber laser welded joints (Fig.4.4(a)). EDS analysis revealed that these particles were unmelted Mn- and Al-containing inclusions (Fig.4.4(b)),which were still present in the weld pool. These particles could act as nuclei and block off the epitaxial columnar dendrite grains. Similar results were also reported by Xiao et al. [36], where they observed that more unmelted Mn-Al particles resulted in a more efficient nucleation, giving rise to a finer grain size in the fusion zone of the weld.

4.2 Microhardness profile
Fig. 4.5 shows a typical hardness profile along the mid-thickness of the 2 mm thick fiber laser welded AZ31B-H24 Mg joints that were welded at a welding speed of 50 mm/s and 100 mm/s with a 2 kW laser power. The lowest hardness appeared at the center of fusion zone after laser welding. The hardness value decreased gradually from about 73HV of the base metal in the halfhardened H24 temper to approximately 54HV at the center of fusion zone across the heataffected zone for the welding speed of 100 mm/s, and about 51HV for the welding speed of 50 mm/s. The hardness of the fiber laser welded joint made at a welding speed of 100 mm/s was generally higher than that made at a welding speed of 50 mm/s, with the lowest hardness in the fusion zone varied from 70% to 74% of the base metal when the welding speed increased from 50 to 100 mm/s. This is due to the larger sizes of equiaxed dendrite grains formed in the fusion zone (Fig. 4.1(c) vs. 4.2(b)) and larger grain sizes in the heat-affected zone (Fig. 4.1(f) vs. 4.2(e)) at the lower welding speed. There was a strong grain size dependence of microhardness, following the Hall-Petch type relationship in the welded AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy [53]. Since the grain boundaries were the main obstacle to the slip of dislocations, the material with a smaller grain size would have a stronger resistance to the localized plastic deformation due to the presence of more grain boundaries, giving rise to a higher hardness or strength. Another reason for the higher hardness would be related to the formation of finer dendrite arm spacing at a higher welding speed, as reported by Turhal and Kan [93].The overall reduction in the hardness after laser welding, shown in Fig. 4.5, is attributed to the remarkable changes in the microstructure from the deformed and elongated grains in the base metal in the half-hardened and partially-annealed H24 state (Fig. 4.1(a)) to the non-equilibrium dendritic solidification structure (Fig. 4.1(c) and 4.2(b)) in conjunction with divorced eutectic -Mg17Al12 particles in the

29

fusion zone (Fig.4.1(d), Fig. 4.2(c), and Fig. 4.3), and recrystallized equiaxed grains in the heataffected zone (Fig.4.1(f) and 4.2(e)). Due to the narrower fusion zone and heat-affected zone, the hardness profile at a welding speed of 100 mm/s appeared sharper, as shown in Fig. 4.5.

4.3 Tensile properties
Fig. 4.6 shows typical stress-strain curves for the base metal, fiber laser welded AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy joints made at different welding speeds of 50 mm/s and 100mm/s and tested at a strain rate

30

of 1×10-4 s-1. It is seen that after welding, both the strength and the elongation (%El) decreased. More reduction in the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) occurred in the fiber laser welded joint at the welding speed of 50 mm/s than 100 mm/s. This was due to the larger dendrite cells/grains in the fusion zone (Fig.4.1(c)) and equiaxed recrystallized grains in the heat-affected zone (Fig. 4.1(f)) at the slower welding speed. As mentioned earlier, the weld exhibited a typical dendritic solidification structure containing a large number of brittle divorced eutectic -Mg17Al12 particles (Fig. 4.1(d) and 4.2(c)), which was significantly different from the microstructure of the rolled and partially-annealed BM (Fig. 4.1(a)).

31

All of the fiber laser welded joints were observed to fracture in the fusion zone during the tensile tests, corresponding to the lowest hardness there (Fig. 4.5). As a result, the ductility of the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy after laser welding diminished. The evaluated YS, UTS and percent elongation of the base metal, fiber laser welded AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy joints are plotted in Fig. 4.7. It is shown that at all the strain rates both the YS and UTS became lower after laser welding. While the welding led to a relatively larger decrease in the YS, the reduction of the UTS was moderate with a joint efficiency of about 89% at a welding speed of 50 mm/s and about 91% at a welding speed of 100 mm/s. Some values of joint efficiency for different Mg alloys are summarized in Table 4.1, where the joint efficiency is the ratio of the UTS of welded joints to the UTS of the corresponding base alloy. It is shown that a wide range of joint efficiency between ~59% and 97% could be obtained, which was associated with the welding processes and parameters as well as the initial state (or initial strength) of the material. The joint efficiency of the 2 mm thick AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy achieved in the present study using a 2 kW fiber laser at a welding speed of either 50 mm/s or 100 mm/s was higher than that of about 84~88% for the same thickness extruded sheet of Mg-6Al-2Ca alloy using 3 kW fiber laser at a welding speed of 67 mm/s to 167 mm/s [19]. As the strain rate increased from 1×10-5 s-1 to 1×10-2 s-1, the YS and UTS of the base metal increased to a certain degree but the ductility decreased considerably. This indicated the presence of stronger strain rate sensitivity in the base metal due to the smaller grain size (Fig. 4.1(a)). Similar results about the effect of grain size on the strain rate sensitivity were also reported in an extruded AZ31 Mg alloy [64]. As dislocations tend to pile-up at grain boundaries during deformation, the smaller grains with more grain boundaries would facilitate the dislocation pile-ups. Del Valle and Ruano [67] reported a relationship between the strain rate

& ) and grain size (d) as follows, sensitivity (  /  ln

 k = d -1 / 2 ( M c - 2 M cg ) + M cg , & 2  ln 

(4.2)

& is strain rate, k is Boltzmann's constant, and Mcg (lncg/ln  & ) and Where  is flow stress,  & ) can be treated as constants [64,67]. This equation expresses a linear relationship Mc(lnc/ln 
between the strain rate sensitivity and grain size in the form of d-1/2, similar to the well-known Hall-Petch equation. It follows that the strain rate sensitivity increases with decreasing grain size. Since the grain size in the AZ31B-H24 base metal was smaller (Fig. 4.1(a)), the strain rate sensitivity would be higher, as shown in Fig. 4.7.After laser welding, the strain rate sensitivity became relatively weaker, as demonstrated by the small increase of the YS and UTS and the slight decrease in the ductility with increasing strain rate (Fig. 4.7). Another reason for the reduction in the tensile properties after welding is related to the formation of new crystallographic texture in the weld zone as reported by Park et al. [62]. Further studies on the texture change after laser welding are needed.

4.4 Strain hardening behavior
The fiber laser welding was anticipated to affect the strain (or work) hardening characteristics of AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy as well. The hardening capacity of a material, Hc, has been defined as a normalized parameter [58],

Hc =

 UTS -  y  UTS = -1, y y

(4.3)

where  y is the yield strength, and  UTS is the ultimate tensile strength of a material. The obtained hardening capacity of the base metal and the fiber laser welded samples is listed in Table 4.2. The hardening capacity increased after fiber laser welding, especially for the fiber laser welded samples at a lower welding speed of 50 mm/s. There was little effect of strain rate on the hardening capacity. A decrease in the grain size would increase the YS as indicated by the HallPetch relationship [96], since it reduced the difference of the flow resistance between the grain boundary and interior, which in turn lowered the hardening capacity [97]. Since the grain size of the fiber laser welded samples at a welding speed of 50 mm/s (Fig. 4.1(c) and 4.1(f)) was larger than that of the fiber laser welded samples at a welding speed of 100 mm/s (Fig. 4.2(b) and 4.2(e)), a higher value of hardening capacity in the fiber laser welded samples at a welding speed of 50 mm/s is expected. Another way of understanding the strain hardening behavior is to determine the strain hardening exponent, since it is a measure of the ability of a material to strain harden; the larger its value, the greater the strain hardening for a given amount of plastic strain. A few equations have been proposed to evaluate the strain hardening exponent. Hollomon [98] proposed the following expression,

 = K n ,

Where n is the strain hardening exponent, K is the strength coefficient,  is the true stress and  is the true strain. To better quantify the strain hardening response, Chen and Lu [99] fitted their tensile curves using the Ludwik equation [100],
 =  y + K 1 n 1

,

(4.5)

where n1 is the strain hardening exponent and K1 is the strength coefficient which represents the increment in strength due to strain hardening at  = 1. Afrin et al. [58] proposed the following equation by considering only the net flow stress and net plastic strain of a material after yielding,

 =  y + K * ( -  y ) n
37

*

,

(4.6)

where n*, , , y and y are the strain hardening exponent, true stress, true strain, yield strength and yield strain of a material, respectively. K* is the strength coefficient which reflects the increment in strength due to strain hardening corresponding to ( ­ y) = 1. The strain hardening exponents evaluated according to the above three equations are shown in Fig. 4.8(a), (b) and (c) for the base metal, fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 50 mm/s and 100 mm/s as a function of strain rate. Only the data lying in-between the YS and UTS were used to evaluate the value of n, n1 and n*. Almost no effect of strain rate on the strain hardening exponents was seen in the base metal. But for the fiber laser welded samples, the strain hardening exponents increased with increasing strain rate. It is also shown that the n values were the smallest and n1 values were the highest with n* lying in-between the two values. The strain hardening exponents evaluated corresponding to all the above three equations were obviously higher after welding, and the fiber laser welded joints made at 50 mm/s exhibited higher strain hardening exponents than the fiber laser welded joints made at 100 mm/s, as shown in Fig. 4.8.

One of the important contributions to the strain hardening is associated with the formation and multiplication of dislocations. In the plastic deformation stage, the net flow stress in relation to the dislocation density could be expressed as [58,65,66],

 - y  

,

(4.7)

Where  is the dislocation density. The net flow stress necessary to continue deformation of a material is proportional to the square root of the dislocation density. The dislocation density in a metal increased with the amount of deformation or cold work due to dislocation multiplication or the formation of new dislocations which in turn decreased the spacing among dislocations and their interactions became repulsive. The net result would be that the movement of a dislocation

39

was blocked by other dislocations. As the dislocation density increased, the resistance to dislocation movement by other dislocations became more pronounced. Then a higher stress was necessary to deform a material [96]. Fig. 4.9 shows a typical Kocks-Mecking plot of strain hardening rate ( = d/d) vs. net flow stress (-y) in the base metal, fiber laser welded samples at a welding speed of 50 mm/s and 100 mm/s tested at a strain rate of 1×10-5 s-1. It is seen that stage III hardening occurred after yielding followed by stage IV hardening for both the base metal and fiber laser welded joints. The strain hardening could be understood as a result of the grain size strengthening and dislocation strain hardening [58,65,66],
 =  o +  HP +  d ,

(4.8)

Where o is the frictional contribution, HP = kd-1/2is the Hall-Petch contribution, and d=MGb1/2 is the Taylor dislocation contribution (where G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, M is the Taylor factor and  is a constant). Sinclair et al. [101] and Kovacs et al. [102] reported that at lower strains the grain size had a strong contribution to the strain hardening and the influence of the grain size on the strain hardening petered out at higher strains due to dislocation screening and dynamic recovery effects at grain boundaries. Because the base metal had a smaller grain size (Fig. 4.1(a)), the Hall-Petch contribution (HP) would be stronger at lower strains, leading to a somewhat higher initial strain hardening rate in comparison to the welded joints. Similar results were reported by Balik et al. [103]. Fig. 4.9 further shows that the steepness (or slope) of stage III became increasingly flatter from the base metal to the fiber laser welded joint at 100 mm/s and to that at 50 mm/s, implying that the decrease in the strain hardening rate with increasing net flow stress was more enduring.

Similar to the tensile properties (Fig. 4.7), the fatigue life decreased after laser welding, and the fatigue life of the fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 100 mm/s was basically longer than that of the fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 50 mm/s.

The obtained fatigue limit (i.e., the fatigue strength at 1×107 cycles) and fatigue ratio (the ratio of fatigue limit to UTS) of the base metal and fiber laser welded joints are listed in Table 4.3. The fatigue limit of the fiber laser welded samples at a welding speed o of f 50 mm/s and 100 mm/s dropped by about 40%, and the fatigue ratio for both fiber laser welded joints decreased by about 32% and 35% relative to that of the base metal. This indicates that the welded joints were more susceptible to the dynamic fatigue loading than quasi quasi-static static tensile loading (Table 4.2) where both the YS and UTS exhibited only a moderate reduction after fiber laser welding.

Again, the decrease in the fatigue resistance after welding was mainly attributed to the microstructural change, as illustrated in Fig. 4.1 and 4.2. The following Basquin-type equation [104] can be used to fit the obtained fatigue data, a= f'(2 f)b, (4.9)

where a is the cyclic stress amplitude, f' is the fatigue strength coefficient defined by the stress intercept at 2 f=1,
f

is the number of cycles to failure, and 2 fis the number of reversals to

failure, and b is the fatigue strength exponent which, varying normally between -0.05 and -0.12 for most of the metals, is a predominant factor for estimating the fatigue life of materials. Based on equation (9), a smaller value of b (in the absolute value) corresponds to a longer fatigue life. It is shown from Fig. 4.10(b) that equation (4.9) could be used to characterize the fatigue data

43

obtained in the present study. It should be noted that the run-out data for which no failure occurred at or over 1×107 cycles were not included in the fitting. The obtained b and f' values are listed in Table 4.3. It is shown that the absolute value of fatigue strength exponent, b, was in the following sequence: base metal < fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 100 mm/s < fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 50 mm/s. This corresponded well to the longer fatigue life for the base metal and shorter fatigue life for the fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 50 mm/s, while the fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 100 mm/s lay in-between them, as shown in Fig. 4.10(a) and 4.10(b). The longer fatigue life observed in the fiber laser welded samples at a higher welding speed of 100 mm/s was mainly due to the smaller grain sizes in both fusion zone (Fig. 4.2(b) vs. 4.1(c)) and heat-affected zone (Fig. 4.2(e) vs. 4.1(f)), in conjunction with the presence of divorced eutectic-Mg17Al12particles in the fusion zone. This was consistent with the higher hardness across the weld (Fig. 4.5) and tensile strength (Fig. 4.7) in the welded joint made at a higher welding speed. Similar results were also obtained by Padmanaban and Balasubramanian [105], where the superior fatigue properties of AZ31 magnesium welded joints made using a 2.5 kW CO2 laser were associated with the formation of smaller grains in weld region, higher fusion zone hardness and uniformly distributed finer precipitates.

4.6 Fractography
Tensile fracture was observed to occur usually from the welding pores or defects in the fusion zone, corresponding well to the lowest hardness shown in Fig. 4.5. Fig. 4.11 shows typical SEM images of the tensile fracture surfaces of the fiber laser welded joints at a welding speed of 50 mm/s and 100 mm/s tested at a strain rate of 1×10-4 s-1. The tensile fracture surface characteristics were similar at both welding speeds. A number of small pores, believed to stem

45

from the air or hydrogen trapped at the solidifying front in the fusion zone during keyhole fiber laser welding, were evident as indicated by arrows in Fig. 4.11(a) and 4.11(c), leading to the decreased tensile and fatigue strength especially ductility (%El) after welding (Fig. 4.7 and 4.10).Some ductile tear ridges together with some cleavage-like brittle fracture characteristics appeared on both fracture surfaces of the welded samples as shown in Fig.4.11(b) and 4.11(d). The fractographic observations corresponded well to the relatively low ductility of ~4% elongation in the fiber laser welded samples (Fig. 4.7(c)).

Fig. 4.12 and 4.13 show SEM images of fatigue fracture surfaces of the fiber laser welded joints made at a welding speed of 50 mm/s and 100 mm/s, respectively. Fatigue cracking essentially initiated from the welding defects at or near the surface (Fig. 4.12(a)-(c) and Fig. 4.13(a)-(c)), irrespective of the applied cyclic stress level. Such welding defects were considered to form due to marginal incision or depression of molten pool during solidification [106], or other processing issues such as spatter, sag, undercut, unstable weld pool, liquation and solidification cracking, unstable weld pool, oxide inclusions and loss of alloying elements [107]. At both welding speeds, welding defects and small pores were observed (Fig. 4.12(b), (c) and (e), and Fig. 4.13(b), (c) and (e)). Yu et al. [108] has suggested that the formation of the small pores was closely related to the stability of the keyhole and the oscillation of the molten pool during the fiber laser welding. The tip of the keyhole was so tiny that it could be readily closed by the flow of molten metal and formed as a bubble. A bubble usually became a gas cavity in the weld bead, because it was often difficult for bubbles to escape from the molten pool at high solidification rates of laser welding due to the fast cooling [108]. At both welding speeds, single crack initiation basically occurred from the surface defect and failure occurred perpendicular to the loading direction at lower stress amplitudes (Fig. 4.12(a), the lower sample in Fig. 4.12(f), Fig. 4.13(a)), while multiple crack initiation sites were more obvious at higher stress amplitudes as shown in Fig. 4.12(b) and 4.13(b) with fracture occurred mainly at ~45° shear to the loading direction (the upper sample in Fig. 4.12(f)). Even without surface welding defects, surface grains were usually less constrained than the internal grains, thus the occurrence of slip in a few grains near the specimen surface became relatively easier during fatigue [109]. Fatigue crack propagation was mainly characterized by fatigue striations (Fig. 4.12(d) and 4.13(d)) along with

The fatigue striations normally occurred by a repeated plastic blunting-sharpening process in the face-centered cubic materials due to the slip of dislocations in the plastic zone ahead of the fatigue crack tip [110]. The formation of fatigue striations in the magnesium alloys with a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure was expected to be additionally associated with the occurrence of twinning-detwinning process [111,112], since the number of slip systems in magnesium alloys was limited at room temperature. Further studies of this aspect are needed.

CHAPTER 5
FRICTIO STIR WELDED AZ31 MAG ESIUM ALLOY: MICROSTRUCTURE, TEXTURE, A D TE SILE PROPERTIES 5.1 Microstructure
A typical macroscopic image of the welded cross-section is shown in Fig. 5.1. The SZ, TMAZ and heat-affected zone (HAZ) could be identified and the microstructural changes would be expected. The microstructure of the AZ31B-H24 BM, as shown in Fig. 5.2(a), consisted of deformed/twinned and somewhat elongated grains with varying sizes. The heterogeneity in such a grain structure of the BM was due to both heavy deformation by rolling to become a 2 mm thick sheet and incomplete dynamic recrystallization (partial annealing) in the H24 condition [47,52,53,58]. The average grain size of the BM was about 3.6 ± 2.2 µm.

The effect of the welding speed and tool rotational rate on the microstructure in the SZ is shown in Fig. 5.2(b)  Fig. 5.2(d). It is seen that, in comparison with the BM microstructure (Fig.5.2(a)), considerable microstructural changes occurred after FSW, with the SZ consisting of an equiaxed grain structure with smooth boundaries, irrespective of the welding speed and rotational rate (Fig.5.2(b)-(d)). This was attributed to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization that arose from a combination of frictional heating, intense plastic deformation, and viscous dissipation due to the rotation of the welding tool during FSW. Similar results have been reported in [51,52,553,58]. The grain size was observed to decrease with increasing welding speed (Fig.5.2(b)  Fig.5.2(c)) but increased with increasing rotational rate (Fig.5.2(c)  Fig.5.2(d)). Such a microstructural evolution could be rationalized on the basis of heat input during FSW. Since heat input decreased with increasing welding speed and decreasing rotational

51

rate, a shorter time or lower peak temperature was available for grain growth at a higher welding speed or at a lower tool rotation rate, which resulted in a smaller grain size. Similar results have been obtained for the thicker (5 mm in thickness) friction stir welded (FSWed) AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy [52,53,58] ] as well as FSWed 6061 and 7075 Al alloys [113-115].

Some particles were also seen in the SZ of the FSWed joints (Fig.5.3(a)). EDS analysis revealed that these particles were undissolved Mn- and Al-containing inclusions (Fig.5.3(b)), which still remained in the SZ. While the peak temperature during FSW was high enough to bring about the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (Fig.5.2(b)-(d)), it would be far below the melting point of the Mn- and Al-containing inclusions which were pre-existent in the AZ31B-H24 Mg base alloy. Such inclusions were indeed observed to be present in the fusion zone after laser welding [82], double-sided arc welding [84], and resistance spot welding of Mg alloy [36,38], where the weld liquid pool would have a higher temperature than the solid-state SZ during FSW. Furthermore, Xiao et al. [36] reported that the undissolved Mn-Al (Al8Mn5) second-phase particles could promote a more efficient nucleation and lead to a finer grain size in the fusion zone of a Mg resistance spot weld.

5.2 Crystallographic texture
The (0002), (10 10), and (10 11) pole figures for a FSWed joint made at a welding speed of 5 mm/s and tool rotational rate of 1000 rpm are shown in Fig. 5.4. Fig. 5.4(a)-(c) indicates the pole figures obtained at different locations (A, B, C, D, and E) from the top surface of the sheet, while Fig. 5.4(d) indicates the pole figures from the cross section of the sheet, where A and B were positioned at 30 mm and 5 mm from the centre of the SZ (i.e., location C) at the advancing side (AS), while D and E were located at 5 mm and 35 mm from the centre of the SZ at the retreating side (RS). It is seen that in the BM (position A and E) and position B and D, the basal plane (0002) normal was largely parallel to the ND with some grains slightly tilted in the RD (Fig. 5.4(a)), and the <10 10> and <10 11> directions were aligned or tilted in the TD (Fig. 5.4(b) and (c)). It has been reported that two major types of texture components, (0002)<11 2 0> and (0002)<10 1 0>, are available, depending on the activation of slip systems in the basal plane (either <11 2 0> single slip or <10 10> double slip oriented in the RD) in the Mg alloys [116,117]. In the present study (0002)< 11 2 0> texture component was mainly observed. Similar (0002)< 11
2 0> texture component in the AZ31 Mg alloy has also been reported in [118-120]. In the SZ

there was a weak tendency for the basal plane (0002) normal to tilt toward the TD, as seen from position C in Fig. 5.4(a). Such a texture change occurred in the SZ was attributed to the intense localized shear plastic flow near the stirring shoulder at the trailing side during FSW. The (0002), (10 10), and (10 11) pole figures obtained from the cross section at different locations are shown in Fig 4(d). Similar to the previous studies [121,122], the BM had a strong texture with the basal plane (0002) normal parallel to the TD while in the stir zone there was a weak tendency for the basal plane (0002) normal to tilt toward the RD (location C). It is well known that the basal plane (0002) in the SZ tended to distribute around the pin surface due to the shear plastic

54

flow arising from the pin rotation which made the parent material to rotate around the threaded pin surface [123]. The orientation of the basal plane (0002) after FSW in different regions of the welded joints was reported in several studies [51,62,124], where the basal plane (0002) normal in the SZ was reported to be relocated in-between TD and ND after FSW. This is in agreement with the present study in which the basal plane (0002) had an inclination in-between the TD and ND, as shown in Fig. 4(d).Since the preferential slip plane of Mg alloy with a hexagonal close-packed structure is known to be basal plane (0002) plane for plastic deformation at room temperature [125], the change in the texture may affect the tensile properties of the FSWed AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy. As seen from location C in Fig.5.4(b), most prismatic planes (10 1 0) in the SZ were oriented toward RD in a concentric circular pattern at 90° from the centre of the pole figure, indicating the formation of basal fiber texture(c-axis in the normal direction) which is also known as crystallographic fibering produced by crystallographic reorientation of the grains during deformation [104,126,127]. The maximum pole densities of prismatic planes (10 10) shifted from the TD to the RD was related to the localized plastic deformation in the SZ. The crystallographic fibering in the SZ could even be better seen from the pyramidal plane (10 11) at location C in Fig.5.4(c), where the normal of pyramidal planes (10 1 1) formed a nearly complete ring at approximately 45° from the center of the pole figure with more (10 11) pole densities distributed parallel to the TD. Some degree of pyramidal planes (10 1 1) fibering characteristics at D positioned near the TMAZ/HAZ boundary is also seen in Fig.5.4(c). This was attributed to the intense stirring plastic flow occurred in the welded region, as also reported by Park et al. [62] in a 6.3 mm thick wrought AZ61 Mg alloy after FSW. For Mg alloys, the critical resolved shear stress for the basal plane (0002) slip system is much lower than that of prismatic plane (10 10) slip system and pyramidal plane (10 11) slip system at room temperature [128]. Therefore, only

55

basal slip would be anticipated when the FSWed Mg alloy was plastically deformed at room temperature, while both the basal and non-basal slip systems might operate during hot deformation at temperatures higher that about 600 K (326.85 °C) [125]. Besides, compared to the BM there was no significant change in the prismatic planes (10 10) and pyramidal planes (10 11) in the SZ, except more obvious fiber texture characteristics, as shown Fig 4(d).

The effect of welding speed and tool rotational rate on the texture is shown in Fig. 5.5, where the basal (0002), prismatic (10 10) and pyramidal (10 11) pole figures were obtained from the center of the SZ (i.e., location C indicated in Fig.5.4) for the FSWed joint made at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm (Fig.5.5(a)) and the FSWed joint made at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 2000 rpm (Fig.5.5(b)). It is seen from these pole figures that similar texture changes occurred in the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy after FSW. However, the relative texture intensity in the SZ was different, which is summarized in Table 5.1. It is clear that after FSW the basal plane (0002) was significantly intensified especially at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm, while there was only a small change in the maximum relative pole intensity for both prismatic planes (10 10) and pyramidal planes (10 11) planes. With increasing rotational rate or decreasing welding speed, the maximum (0002) and (10 10) pole intensities decreased. This was due to the fact that the higher tool rotational rate or lower welding speed generated a higher temperature in the SZ, which resulted in more complete dynamic recrystallization. This would in turn lead to a relatively weaker or more random orientation. Similar observations were also reported in the FSWed AZ31B billet and extruded plate [70], where more random orientation at higher rotational rates was observed.

5.3 Microhardness
Fig. 5.6(a) and 6(b) shows the typical hardness profiles across the AZ31B-H24 weldments made with different welding parameters. It is seen that the hardness value decreased gradually from about HV 73 for the half-hardened H24 temper BM to approximately HV 62 at the center of the SZ through the HAZ and TMAZ of the welded joints. The decrease in the hardness was a consequence of a combined effect of the grain growth and the change of the material state from the H24 temper to recrystallzation state (Fig.5.2). The hardness in the SZ slightly varied from 84% to 86% of the BM hardness when the tool rotational rate decreased from 2000 rpm to 1000 rpm (Fig. 6(a)) and the welding speed increased from 5 mm/s to 20 mm/s (Fig. 6(b)). Similar changes in the microstructure and the resulting hardness were reported in [52,53,113-115,129].

63

The hardness of SZ in the weld was mainly associated with the heat input during FSW and the ensuing change in the grain size. Specifically, there was a strong grain size dependence for the microhardness, which followed the Hall-Petch type relationship in the welded AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy [52,53]. Since the grain boundaries were the main obstacle to the slip of dislocations, the microstructure with a smaller grain size would have a higher resistance to localized plastic deformation due to the presence of a greater number of grain boundary area that culminated to a higher hardness or strength [52]. Therefore, the hardness increase with decreasing rotational rate and increasing welding speed was attributed to the smaller sizes of recrystallized equiaxed grains formed in the SZ at a lower rotational rate from 2000 rpm to 1000 rpm (from Fig. 5.2(d) to Fig. 5.2(c)) while keeping the welding speed constant at 20 mm/s, and at a higher welding speed from 5 mm/s to 20 mm/s (from Fig. 5.2(b) to Fig. 5.2(c)) while maintaining the rotational rate constant at 1000 rpm. Another reason for the lower hardness in the SZ would be related to the texture variation. During FSW complex plastic deformation occurred in the welded region, and relatively more random orientation with more obvious fiber texture characteristics (Fig. 5.4(d)) was produced in the FSWed Mg alloy joints, i.e., the basal plane (0002) rotated around the stir pin, thereby producing a soft region around the SZ [62,130]. As a result, the low hardness value observed in the SZ of the FSWed joints in the present study was expected to be also associated with the local texture variation.

Fig. 5.7 shows typical engineering stress versus engineering strain curves of the BM and FSWed AZ31B Mg alloy joints made at different welding speeds and rotational rates tested at a strain rate of 1×10-2 s-1 at room temperature. It is seen that after FSW both the strength and elongation decreased. The yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the BM in the RD was obtained to be about 212 MPa and 285 MPa, respectively, which was approximately 6% higher than the minimum YS and UTS of 200 and 269 MPa, respectively, specified in ASTM B90-07 for the present thin gauge section sheet material in the H24 condition. A joint efficiency (i.e., a ratio of the UTS of the welded joints to the UTS of the base alloy) of the FSWed joints was obtained to lie in-between approximately 75% and 82%. The elongation after FSW was relatively low compared to the BM.

Fig. 5.8 demonstrates the effect of strain rate on the tensile properties of the BM and FSWed joints at varying welding speeds and rotational rates. As expected, both the strength and ductility of the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy after FSW decreased at all the strain rates. A slight increase of YS and UTS with increasing strain rate in the BM was observed (Fig.5.8(a) and (b)), while the ductility decreased dramatically (Fig.5.8(c)). After FSW the strain rate dependence of the tensile properties became weaker or nearly disappeared within the experimental scatter. The effect of the welding speed and rotational rate on the YS and UTS of the FSWed joints could be seen in Fig. 5.8(a) and Fig.5.8(b) as well. While the FSWed sample made at a rotational rate of 2000 rpm and welding speed of 20 mm/s exhibited a higher ductility of 4~5% elongation (Fig. 5.8(c)) (which was also close to the ductility of 6% specified in the ASTM B90-07 for the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy), its YS dropped to become 130~135 MPa only, i.e., about 61-64% of the YS of BM. A significant increase in the YS to ~175 MPa (~83% of that of the BM) was achieved when the rotational rate decreased from 2000 rpm to 1000 rpm while keeping a constant welding speed of 20 mm/s (Fig.5.8(a)). However, a decrease in the welding speed from 20 mm/s to 5 mm/s at a constant tool rotational rate of 1000 rpm led to a drop in the YS back to ~155 MPa (~73% of that of the BM). The reason behind this could be explained by the heat generated during FSW. The total energy generated by the rotating pin tool to the workpiece (Etotal), consisted of the energy due to the plastic deformation of the material (Eplastic) and the energy created by friction between the tool and workpieces (Efriction) [52,131]. During FSW lower heat was generated at a higher welding speed and/or lower rotational rate, leading to a smaller grain size of the FSWed joints (Fig. 5.2(c)). It is well known that the YS of a material at room temperature is dependent on the grain size according to the following Hall-Petch relationship,

Y = o + kd-1/ 2 ,
67

(5.1)

where Y is the YS of the material, d is the grain size, o is the "friction stress" representing the overall resistance of the crystal lattice to dislocation movement (or the YS corresponding to a material with infinitely large grain size, which is similar to that of a single crystal), and k is a constant called "locking parameter" reflecting the relative hardening contribution of grain boundaries as obstacles to the slip of dislocations across the grain boundaries [53,104,131]. Grain boundaries were the major obstacle to the slip of dislocations and the material with a smaller grain size would impose more restrictions to the dislocation movement and have a higher resistance to localized plastic deformation stemming from the presence of a greater number of grain boundaries that led to a higher YS. Since the grain size of the FSWed samples at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm (Fig. 2(c)) was smaller than that of the FSWed samples at a welding speed of 5 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm (Fig. 2(b)) and FSWed samples at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 2000 rpm (Fig. 2(d)), a higher value of YS in the FSWed samples at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm would be expected. As shown in Fig. 5.8(b) the UTS increased with increasing welding speed and rotational rate as well. However, the extent of its increase was not so significant in comparison with the change in the YS. Similar results were observed by several researchers [47,53,55]. Besides the effect of grain sizes or grain boundaries, crystallographic orientation/texture distribution also strongly influenced the tensile strength since plastic deformation arose from the slip on the closed-packed basal planes with the minimum critical resolved shear stress as mentioned earlier. When the FSWed joints was deformed at room temperature along the RD (loading direction), the basal planes would rotate to lie parallel to the rolling sheet surface and the tensile axis. This might be a result of basal dislocation activity in favorably oriented grains. Similar correlation between the texture and tensile behavior for

68

FSWed of AZ31 alloy were reported by Yang et al. [124], Woo et al. [130,132], and Yu et al. [133]. In comparison with other two welding conditions, the stronger intensity of basal plane (0002) present in the low-hardness SZ at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm (Table 5.1) implied that the basal planes were more oriented parallel to the rolling sheet surface, i.e., the basal plane normal of more grains was perpendicular to the sheet surface which resulted a stronger pole intensity. As a result, less extent of rotation of the basal planes was required during tensile deformation, leading to a higher YS (Fig.5.8(a)) and a lower ductility (Fig.5.8(c)). As shown in Fig. 5.7 and Fig. 5.8(c), the percent elongation increased with increasing rotational rate, which was in good agreement with the results reported in [53,58,134]. The hardening capacity (as discussed in Chapter 4) of the BM and the FSWed samples are evaluated by using Equation 4.3 listed in Table 5.2. It is seen that the hardening capacity of the FSWed samples made at a higher welding speed of 20 mm/s and higher rotational rate of 2000 rpm was about twice the hardening capacity of the BM. While the hardening capacity of the FSWed samples made at a welding speed of 5 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm was slightly higher than that of BM, it became lower for the FSWed samples made at a welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 1000 rpm than for the BM. To understand the strain hardening behavior in an alternative way, the strain hardening exponent of different materials was evaluated. The strain hardening exponent is a measure of the ability of a metal to strain harden; the larger its magnitude, the greater the strain hardening for a given amount of plastic strain [96].

Several researchers have proposed different equations to evaluate the strain hardening exponent. Fig. 5.9 shows the evaluated strain hardening exponents (n and n* as discussed in Chapter 4) as a function of strain rate for the BM and FSWed joints at different welding speeds and rotational rates. Only the tensile test data lying in-between the YS and UTS were used to evaluate the values of n and n*. It is clear that the strain hardening exponent after FSW became much higher due to the significant changes in both the microstructure (Fig. 5.2(b)-(d) vs. Fig.5.2(a)) and texture in the SZ (Fig.5.4 and Fig.5.5). While a similar trend for both n and n* values in relation to the welding parameters and strain rates was seen in Fig. 5.9(a) and Fig. 5.9(b), the values of n* were more than twice larger than those of n due to the exclusion of elastic deformation in the evaluation of n* values via Equation. (4.6). This suggests that the n* value was more sensitive in characterizing the strain hardening behavior of materials. While the strain hardening exponent of

71

the BM was nearly independent of the strain rate (i.e., n=~0.12 and n*=~0.35), the strain hardening exponent of the FSWed joints at different welding speeds and rotational rates increased slightly with increasing strain rate. The strain hardening exponent increased as the welding speed decreased from 20 mm/s to 5 mm/s while the rotational rate was kept constant at 1000 rpm. On the other hand, the strain hardening exponent increased with increasing rotational rates from 1000 rpm to 2000 rpm while the welding speed remained constant at 20 mm/s. These changes corresponded well to those of the YS, UTS, and ductility shown in Fig. 5.8. The main reason why both high welding speed of 20 mm/s and rotational rate of 2000 rpm gave rise to a significantly higher hardening capacity (Table 5.2) and higher strain hardening exponent (Fig.5.9) was associated with the obviously larger grain size (Fig.5.2(d)), since the larger recrystallized grains had a larger dislocation storage capacity during plastic deformation [58].

6.1 Microstructure
Typical microstructures of the base metal (BM) of AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy and Al 5754-O Al alloy are shown in Fig. 6.1(a) and Fig. 6.1(b), respectively. The cross section of a weld can usually be divided into four regions, i.e., BM, heat-affected zone (HAZ), thermomechanicalaffected zone (TMAZ) and stir zone (SZ). The typical microstructures of these regions are shown in Fig. 6.1(a), (c), (d) and (e), respectively for a Mg/Mg similar weld. As shown in Fig. 6.1(a), elongated and pancake-shaped grains with varying sizes were observed in the BM of the Mg alloy due to both the deformation of the 2 mm thick sheet by rolling and incomplete dynamic recrystallization (partial annealing) [52,53,58]. The elongated grains in the BM of the Mg alloy have experienced recrystallization and become equiaxed in the SZ (Fig. 6.1(e)) of the Mg/Mg similar weld. The grains in the HAZ and TMAZ (Fig. 6.1(c) and Fig. 6.1(d)) were partially recrystallized and appeared less uniformly sized, compared with those in the SZ. Condense grain structure was observed in the SZ due to the dynamic recrystallization occurring in the periphery of the pin tool because of the stirring movement and friction thermal cycle [8]. In the SZ, the intense plastic deformation and high temperatures caused dynamic recrystallization, inducing the appearance of fine and homogenous grains, whereas the grains in the HAZ and TMAZ became coarser because of the predominant effect of the friction heating. A similar compact equiaxed grain structure in the SZ and coarse grains in the TMAZ and HAZ for FSS weld of AZ31 alloy

73

was reported by Jordon et al. [72], Shen et al. [135] and Ding et al. [136].A typical optical image at the interface of a dissimilar Al-to-Mg (Al/Mg) weld is shown in Fig. 6.1(e).The interface was marked by the presence of an interfacial layer that covered most of the boundary but varied in thickness. Fig. 6.2(a) shows a SEM image of the interface taken from the cross-section of an Al/Mg dissimilar weld. It is seen that a distinguishable interlayer with a thickness up to ~20 µm occurred in-between the Mg alloy (at the left side in Fig. 6.2(a)) and the Al alloy (at the right side in Fig. 6.2(a)). The EDS line analysis result shown in Fig. 6.2(b) revealed the mutual presence of Al and Mg across the reaction layer, suggesting that an intermetallic (IMC) layer formed at the Al/Mg interface during FSSW. X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from the two matching fracture surfaces, one on the Al alloy side and the other on the Mg alloy side, are shown in Fig. 6.3(a) and Fig. 6.3(b). Besides Mg, Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17were observed on the fracture surface of Mg alloy side, while Al and Al3Mg2 were identified on the fracture surface of Al alloy side with the absence of Al12Mg17. Similar results were also reported by Sato et al. [71] for the FSSW of AZ31 to AA5083 alloys. The formation of such intermetallic compounds in the Al/Mg dissimilar welds was due to the constitutive liquation during FSSW [137,138]. Gerlich et al. [139] conducted FSSW of AA6111 to AZ91 alloys and reported that the peak temperature in the vicinity of the tool rapidly reached the -Mg and Al12Mg17 eutectic temperature of 437°C, at which the eutectic microstructure formed. According to the Al-Mg phase diagram [140], a wide range of chemical composition that exhibited a low melting temperature in the Al-Mg system could assist in the formation of the inhomogeneous interfacial layer between the Al/Mg dissimilar weld.

In addition, some particles were also seen in the SZ of the Al/Mg dissimilar weld (Fig. 6.4(a)). EDS analysis revealed that these particles were unmelted Mn- and Al-containing containing (~67 at.% Al and ~33 at.% Mn) intermetalics (Fig. 6.4(a) and Fig. 6.4(b)). . Similar results were we also reported by Xiao et al. [36,38] for resistance spot welding of a Mg alloy alloy, , where they observed that many unmelted Mn-Al (Al8Mn5) second second-phase phase particles resulted in effective nucleation sites, giving rise to a fine grain size in the fusion zone of t the resistance spot weld.

6.2 Microhardness
The hardness distribution across the Al/Al and Mg/Mg similar welds obtained from the upper and lower sheets is shown in Figs 6.5 and 6.6, respectively. Compared to the hardness of the base metal of Al and Mg alloys, the hardness was lower in a region approximately 7-10 mm in diameter centered in the welded region. There was only a small difference in hardness between the upper and lower sheets, with the minimum hardness appearing below the shoulder and the hardness increasing progressively closer to the keyhole periphery. As shown in Fig. 6.6, the hardness distribution of the Mg/Mg similar weld was observed to be nearly symmetric with respect to the center of the keyhole, showing a W-shaped appearance. The hardness in the HAZ and TMAZ was lower than that of the base Mg alloy, and reached a minimum value of ~52 HV in the TMAZ which was equivalent to ~70% of the base metal hardness. The hardness in the SZ located just below the pin bottom (just beneath the bottom of the keyhole) was indeed higher than that in the TMAZ and HAZ of Mg/Mg weld, as seen in Fig. 6.6. Such a hardness change in each zone of the weld corresponded well to the variation in the grain sizes of the HAZ, TMAZ, and SZ (i.e., Fig. 6.1(c)  6.1(e)). According to the Hall-Petch relationship in the welded AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy [52,53,58], the finer grain structure would result in a higher value of hardness in the SZ as compared to the TMAZ and HAZ. Since the grain boundaries were the main obstacle to the slip of dislocations, the material with a smaller grain size would have a stronger resistance to the localized plastic deformation due to the presence of more grain boundaries, giving rise to a higher hardness or strength. As shown in Fig. 6.7, the SZ below the bottom of keyhole in the Al/Mg dissimilar weld had much higher hardness values lying inbetween 120 and 150 HV. This higher hardness was predominantly due to the presence of hard and brittle IMCs (Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17 phases), as identified by XRD (Fig. 6.3). Similar results

79

were also reported by other researchers [ [71,137,138,142-144]. ]. Therefore, the microhardness test results provided a further corroboration for the occurrence of hard IMCs in the Al/Mg dissimilar weld, which could become an easy fracture path as presented in the later sections.

6.3 Lap shear strength
Typical load vs. displacement curves of the Al/Al and Mg/Mg similar welds, and Al/Mg dissimilar welds tested at a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min are shown in Fig. 6.8(a). It is clear that both the Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar welds were much stronger than the Al/Mg dissimilar weld, and the Mg/Mg similar weld was further stronger than the Al/Al similar weld. However, the Al/Al similar weld could endure longer. The evaluated maximum lap shear load is shown in Fig. 6.8(b). It is clear that the maximum lap shear load of the Mg/Mg similar weld was higher than that of the Al/Al similar weld, which was further higher than that of the Al/Mg dissimilar weld. The considerably lower maximum lap shear load in the Al/Mg dissimilar weld was obviously attributed to the formation of a brittle IMC layer (Figs 6.2, 6.3 and 6.7). A similar observation on the maximum lap shear load was also reported by Miller et al. [145] for FSS weld 1.5-mm thick Al 6111-T4 alloy sheets reinforced with ancorsteel particles, where they reported that the maximum lap shear load increased by 25% for the steel particle reinforced metal matrix composites (MMC) as compared to that of the base metal. To characterize more completely the lap shear characteristics of the welds, the failure energy was estimated, where the failure energy was defined as the area below the load-displacement curve shown in Fig. 6.8(a). When the tensile lap shear remained continuous after reaching the maximum load without failure (i.e., in the case of Al/Al similar weld in the present study), the failure energy was only calculated corresponding to the maximum load in a more conservative manner. The evaluated results are plotted in Fig. 6.8(c). While the failure energy of the Al/Al similar weld was greater than that of the Mg/Mg similar weld, the failure energy of the Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar welds was substantially higher than that of the Al/Mg dissimilar weld. There exists a direct correlation between the failure energy in the lap shear tensile tests and impact tests. This implies that the

82

Al/Al similar weld would have a higher impact resistance than that of the Mg/Mg similar weld. Furthermore, nugget pullout failure was observed for the Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar welds while nugget debonding failure was observed for the Al/Mg dissimilar weld during lap shear tensile tests (Fig. 6.8(a)).

6.4 Fatigue behavior and failure mode
Fatigue test results of the Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar welds, and Al/Mg dissimilar welds obtained at RT, R=0.2, and 50 Hz are plotted in Fig. 6.9. Like the failure energy (Fig. 6.8(c)), the fatigue life of the 5754-O Al/Al similar welds was in general longer than that of the AZ31B-H24 Mg/Mg similar welds in spite of the presence of a relatively large experimental scatter. A longer fatigue life for the Al 5754-O similar weld was reported in comparison with that of the Al 6111T4 similar weld under the same cyclic loading condition (R=0.2, f =10 Hz) [18]. The fatigue life of the Al/Mg dissimilar welds was much lower and more scattered than that of both the Al/Al and Mg/Mg similar welds especially at the maximum cyclic load higher than 1 kN. Again, this was due to the formation of IMCs at the interface between the Mg and Al alloys during FSSW (Figs 6.2, 6.3, and 6.7). The weld nugget was pulled out of the top sheet of the Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar welds at the maximum cyclic load of 4 kN, as shown by the inserted images in Fig. 6.9. The nugget pullout failure occurred as the crack propagated circumferentially around the nugget. The shear stress in the remaining area of the nugget increased with each advancement of the crack front. After the crack had propagated around half of the nugget with a keyhole the shear stresses acting in the area were such that the remaining cross section could not sustain the shear overload, then the nugget pullout failure occurred. In contrast, the failure of the Al/Al and Mg/Mg similar welds occurred nearly at a right angle to the loading direction at the maximum cyclic load below 1.5 kN (Fig. 6.9). This suggests that the fatigue failure was caused by the opening of the keyhole through crack initiation in the TMAZ and HAZ, due to the significant microstructural change or grain coarsening (Fig. 6.1(c) and Fig. 6.1(d)) and the lower hardness (Fig. 6.5 and Fig. 6.6), and then propagated perpendicular to the loading direction that indeed resulted in normal tensile failure mode. Nugget debonding failure mode was observed in the

85

Al/Mg dissimilar welds as a consequence of the presence of an interfacial al IMC layer in the Al/Mg dissimilar welds (Figs 6.2, 2, 6.3, and 6.7).

It should be noted that the run-out out data for which no failure occurred at or over 1×107 cycles were not included in the fitting. As shown in Fig. 6.9(b) and Fig. 6.9(c) 9(c) for the Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar welds, a longer fatigue life was observed at the lower maximum load, where the slope was

86

steeper corresponding to the normal tensile failure mode, than that at the higher maximum load where the slope was flatter in line with the failure mode of nugget pullout.

6.5 Fractography
Figs 6.10 and 6.11 show SEM images of the fatigue fracture surfaces of the Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar welds and the load dependence of failure mode. At a lower level of maximum cyclic loads, as shown in Fig 6.10(a)-(c) and Fig. 6.11(a)-(c), fatigue cracking was caused by the opening of the keyhole through the TMAZ and HAZ and then propagated at right angles to the loading direction. Fatigue crack propagation was mainly characterized by the formation of fatigue striations (Fig. 6.10(c) and Fig. 6.11(c)) in conjunction with secondary cracks, which appeared usually perpendicular to the fatigue crack propagation direction. Fatigue striations normally occurred by a repeated plastic blunting-sharpening process in the face-centered cubic materials, stemming from the glide of dislocations on the slip plane along the slip direction within the plastic zone ahead of a fatigue crack tip [110]. The formation of fatigue striations in the magnesium alloys with a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure was expected to be additionally associated with the occurrence of twinning-detwinning process

[11,64,111,112,146,147], since the number of slip systems in magnesium alloys is limited at room temperature. On the other hand, at the higher maximum cyclic load as shown in Fig 6.10(d)-(e) and Fig. 6.11(d)-(e), a fatigue crack initiated in region A, propagated towards region B along circumferential direction and finally fractured in the mode of nugget pullout in region C located in the SZ. The ridge in region A had roots in the upward material flow of the lower sheet [148], but it should be noted that only a small amount of the lower sheet material underneath the hook flowed upward into the upper sheet. A lot of elongated dimples, e.g., as seen in Fig 6.10(e) for region B, indicated the occurrence of shear fracture prior to the nugget pullout during fatigue tests at the higher maximum cyclic load.

Fig. 6.12 shows SEM images of the fatigue fracture surface of the Al/Mg dissimilar weld. For the dissimilar weld, nugget debonding fracture was observed, as seen in Fig 6.12(a) and Fig. 6.12(b), showing that the faying surface between the upper and lower sheets was torn off, and leaving a relatively smooth fracture surface. At all cyclic load levels, nugget debonding first took place near the keyhole and then the crack propagated towards the circumferential side, causing the whole nugget in the circumferential side to pull-out from the lower sheet. This was mainly attributed to the presence of IMC layers of Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17 phases, as observed via SEM/EDS (Fig. 6.2) and identified via XRD (Fig. 6.3), along with the additional Al-Mn particles as shown in Fig. 6.12(c) and Fig. 6.12(d), which thus considerably decreased the fatigue life of the Al/Mg dissimilar weld. The fatigue striations were also observed at the Mg side of fracture surface at the lower maximum cyclic load (Fig. 6.12(f)).

7.1 Microstructure
Typical base metal (BM) microstructures for the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy and the AA5754-O Al alloy are shown in Fig. 7.1(a) and Fig. 7.1(b), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7.1(a), elongated and pancake-shaped grains with varying sizes were observed in the BM of the Mg alloy due to both the deformation of the 2 mm thick sheet by rolling and incomplete dynamic recrystallization (partial annealing) [52,53,58].

Typical optical images at the interface of the dissimilar Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds are shown in Fig. 7.1(c) and Fig. 7.1(d), respectively. For the Al/Mg weld, the interface was marked by the presence of an interfacial layer which covered most of the boundary of the interface but the thickness of the interfacial layer varied. However, it was different for Mg/Al adhesive weld where the interface was marked by both the adhesive and interfacial layer. Fig. 7.2(a) shows a SEM image of the interface taken from the cross-section of an Al/Mg weld. A distinguishable interlayer with a thickness up to ~20 µm was observed at the interface between the Mg (at the left side in Fig. 7.2(a)) and the Al (at the right side in Fig. 7.2(a)) alloys. The EDS line analysis revealed the mutual presence of Al and Mg across the reaction layer, suggesting that the intermetallic (IMC) layer formed at the Al/Mg interface during FSSW. As shown by the

93

corresponding EDS line analysis of the image in Fig. 7.2(b), 2(b), the presence of the adhesive in the Mg/Al adhesive weld interface decreased the thickness of t the IMC layer.

Fig.7.2 2 SEM micrographs of the Al Al-Mg Mg phase at the interfaces of dissimilar (a) Al/Mg weld, (b) Mg/Al adhesive weld and the corresponding EDS line scans across the interface showing the compositional variations of Al and Mg Mg.

An X-ray ray diffraction pattern obtained from the fracture surface of the Mg/Al adhesive weld (Mg alloy side) is shown in Fig. 7.3. 3. Besides Mg, Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17 were observed on the fracture surface of the Mg alloy side. Similar results were also reported by Sato et al. [71 71] and Choi et al. [141] ] for FSSW of AZ31 to AA5083 and AA6K21 alloys. The formation of those intermetallic compounds in the Al/Mg dissimilar welds was due to the constitutive liquation during FSSW [71,141]. Gerlich et al. [139] ] conducted FSSW of AA6111 to AZ91 alloys and reported rep that the peak temperature in the vicinity of the tool rapidly reached the -Mg Mg and Al12Mg17 eutectic

95

temperature of 437°C, at which the eutectic microstructure formed. According to the Al-Mg Al phase diagram [140], ], a wide range in the chemical composition exhibited a low melting temperature in the Al-Mg Mg system which most likely assists in the formation of the inhomogeneous interfacial layer in the SZ of the Al/Mg as well as the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds.

7.2 Microhardness
The hardness distribution across the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds obtained from the upper and lower sheets is shown in Fig 7.4(a) and Fig. 7.4(b), 4(b), respectively. There was only a small

96

difference in hardness between the upper and lower sheets and the hardness increased progressively close to the keyhole periphery. As shown in Fig. 7.4(a), 4(a), the hardness distribution of the Al/Mg adhesive weld was observed to be nearly symmetric with respect to the center of the keyhole. As shown in Fig. 7. 7.4(a) and Fig. 7.4(b), the SZ in the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds had much higher hardness values lying in in-between 90 and 125 HV. This higher hardness was predominantly inantly due to the presence of hard and brittle IMCs ( (Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17 phases), as identified by XRD (Fig. 7.3). 3). Similar results were also reported by other researchers [71,137[ 138,142-144]. ]. Therefore, the microhardness test results provided a further corroboration for the occurrence of hard IMCs in the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds, which may become an easy fracture path to be discussed in the sections below.

7.3 Lap shear strength
Typical load vs. displacement curves for the Al/Mg as well as the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds are shown in Fig. 7.5(a). It is seen that both the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds were much stronger than the Al/Mg weld, and the Mg/Al adhesive weld was in turn stronger than the Al/Mg adhesive weld. eld. The maximum lap shear load that was obtained is shown in Fig. 7.5(b). It is clear that the maximum lap shear load of the Mg/Al adhesive weld was higher than that of the Al/Mg adhesive weld, which was in turn higher than that of the Al/Mg weld. The considerably con lower maximum lap shear load in the Al/Mg weld is obviously attributed to the formation of the brittle IMC layer at the interface and decreasing the extent of IMC formation at the interface by using an adhesive in the Mg/Al adhesive weld resulted in a higher lap shear load. A similar

98

observation of the maximum lap shear load was also reported by Liu and Ren [78] for 1.5-mm thick MIG spot adhesive welded AZ31 to AA 6061 sheets; they reported that the maximum lap shear load increased by three times compared to that of the MIG welded joint without the adhesive. Higher lap shear loads for laser adhesive welding of AZ31 to AA6061 alloy was also reported [79,80]. To characterize more completely the lap shear characteristics of the welds, failure energy was estimated in the present work, where the failure energy was defined as the area below the load-displacement curve shown in Fig. 7.5(a). When the tensile lap shear remained continuous after reaching the maximum load without failure (i.e., in the case of Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds in the present study), the failure energy was only calculated corresponding to the maximum load in a more conservative manner. The failure energy results are plotted in Fig. 7.5(c). The failure energy of the Mg/Al adhesive weld (~26.5 J) was greater than that of the Al/Mg adhesive weld (~9.5 J) and both of these values were substantially greater than than that of the Al/Mg weld (~0.34 J). Hence the application of an adhesive during FSSW influences markedly the joint stability through the presence of a large lap bonded area. Also, since there exists a direct correlation between the failure energy in the lap shear tensile tests and impact tests, it is expected that the Mg/Al adhesive weld would have a higher impact resistance than that of the Al/Mg adhesive weld. Furthermore, nugget pullout failure was observed for the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds while nugget debonding failure was observed for the Al/Mg weld during lap shear tensile tests (Fig. 7.5(a)). Therefore, the presence of adhesive provided a further corroboration on a higher lap shear strength for the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive weld which attributed with different failure modes to be seen in the later sections.

7.4 Fatigue behavior and failure mode
Fatigue test results of the Al/Mg, as well as the Al/Mg and Mg/Al welds with an adhesive obtained at RT, R=0.2, and 50 Hz are plotted in Fig. 7.6. Resembling the maximum load and failure energy (Fig. 7.5(a) 5(a) and Fig. 7.5(c)), 5(c)), the fatigue life of the Mg/Al adhesive weld was in general longer than that of the Al/Mg adhesive weld. The fatigue life of the Al/Mg dissimilar weld was much lower and more scattered than that of both the Mg/Al and Al/Mg adhesive welds especially at t a maximum cyclic load higher than 1 kN. The greatly improved fatigue resistance of the Mg/Al and Al/Mg adhesive welds was primarily attributed to the elimination of stress concentration surrounding the weld nugget as a result of large lap bonded area which whi may lessen the formation of IMC layer at the interface and lead to uniform stress distribution in the lap joint

during fatigue testing. Similarly, a longer fatigue life for the resistance spot adhesive welded AZ31 to HSLA steel sheets was reported in comparison with that of joint assembled without an adhesive under the same cyclic loading condition (R = 0.2, f = 50 Hz) [85].

Fig. 7.7(a) reveals the onion ring shaped weld nugget (Al 87 wt%, Mg 13 wt% determined by EDS) that was pulled out from the top and bottom sheets of the Al/Mg adhesive welds at the maximum cyclic load of 8 kN. The nugget pullout failure occurred as the crack propagated circumferentially around the nugget. The shear stress in the remaining area of the nugget increased with each advancement of the crack front. After the crack had propagated around half

102

of the nugget with a keyhole, the shear stresses acting in the area were such that the remaining cross section could not sustain the shear overload, then the nugget pullout failure occurred. In contrast, the failure of the Al/Mg adhesive weld occurred nearly at a right angle to the loading direction at the maximum cyclic load below 3 kN (Fig. 7.7(b)). Nugget pull out failure mode was observed in the Mg/Al adhesive weld for both high and low cyclic loads (Fig. 7.8(a) and Fig.7.8(b)).

7.5 Fractography
Figs.7.7 and 7.8 show SEM images of the fatigue fracture surfaces of the Al/Mg and Mg/Al adhesive welds and the load dependence of the failure mode. At a lower level of maximum cyclic loads as shown in Fig.7.7(b)-(e) for the Al/Mg adhesive weld, fatigue cracking was caused by the opening of the keyhole through crack initiation and then propagation progressed at right angles to the loading direction. Fatigue crack propagation was mainly characterized by the formation of fatigue striations (Fig. 7.7(e) and Fig. 7.8(e)) in conjunction with secondary cracks, which appeared usually perpendicular to the fatigue crack propagation direction. The fatigue striations usually occurred by a repeated plastic blunting-sharpening process in the face-centered cubic materials, stemming from the glide of dislocations on the slip plane along the slip direction within the plastic zone ahead of a fatigue crack tip [110]. The formation of fatigue striations in the magnesium alloys with a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure was expected to be additionally associated with the occurrence of twinning-detwinning process

[11,64,111,112,146,147], since there exist a lower number of slip systems in magnesium alloys at room temperature. On the other hand, at the higher maximum cyclic load for Al/Mg adhesive weld, as shown in Fig 7.7(f), and at both higher and lower maximum cyclic load for Mg/Al adhesive weld (Fig.7.8(c)-(d)), the fatigue crack initiated in region A, propagated towards region

103

B along the circumferential direction and finally fractured in the mode of nugget pullout in region C located in the SZ. The ridge in region A had roots in the upward material flow of the lower sheet [148], but it should be noted that only a small amount of the lower sheet material underneath the hook flowed upward into the upper sheet. In a previous study by the authors [149], nugget debonding fracture mode was observed for the Al/Mg dissimilar weld. Again, the presence of IMC layers of Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17 phases, as observed via SEM/EDS (Fig.7.9) and identified via XRD (Fig.7.3)on the fracture surface of the Mg/Al adhesive weld (Mg side), which considerably decreased the fatigue life of the Mg/Al adhesive weld.

CHAPTER 8 SUMMARY A D FUTURE WORK
8.1 Summary
1. The microstructure of the as-received AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy sheet consisted of some
deformed and twinned grains. Fiber laser welding (FLW) of AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy at both welding speeds of 50 mm/s and 100 mm/s led to the formation of characteristic equiaxed dendrites in the center of fusion zone (FZ) and columnar dendrites near the fusion zone boundary, coupled with a large number of divorced eutectic -Mg17Al12 particles existing mainly in the interdendritic and intergranular regions, while recrystallized grains emerged in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). The fusion zone was wider, and both the dendrite cell size in the fusion zone and the grain size in the heat-affected zone became larger at a welding speed of 50 mm/s than 100 mm/s. After friction stir welding (FSW) the grains in the stir zone (SZ) became recrystallized with an equaixed shape with the grain size decreased with increasing welding speed and decreasing rotational rate.

2. After friction stir spot welding (FSSW) the elongated grains in the base Mg alloy became
equiaxed as a result of dynamic recrystallization in the SZ of the Mg/Mg similar FSS weld, with partial recrystallization occurring in the TMAZ and HAZ. The Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld was characterized by the formation of a distinctive interfacial layer consisting of Al12Mg17 and Al3Mg2 intermetallic compounds.

3. The base Mg alloy contained a strong crystallographic texture, with the basal plane (0002)
largely parallel to the sheet plane and <11 2 0> direction aligned in the rolling direction (RD). After FSW the basal planes in the SZ were slightly tilted toward the TD determined from the

108

sheet normal direction (top surface) and also slightly inclined toward the RD determined from the transverse direction (cross section) due to the intense shear plastic flow near the pin surface. The prismatic planes (10 1 0) and pyramidal planes (10 1 1) formed mainly fiber textures. With increasing tool rotational rate or decreasing welding speed, the maximum pole intensities of (0002) and (10 10) poles decreased.

4. After fiber laser welding (FLW) and friction stir welding (FSW) of AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy the
lowest hardness appeared at the center of fusion zone (FZ) and stir zone (SZ) respectively. The microhardness profile of the Mg/Mg FSS weld exhibited a W-shaped appearance, where the hardness gradually increased towards the keyhole direction. A much higher hardness with values in-between 120 and 150 HV was observed in the stir zone underneath the bottom of the keyhole in the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld due to the presence of an intermetallic compound layer.

5. While fiber laser welding (FLW) resulted in a certain extent of reduction in the yield strength,
ductility, and fatigue life of FLWed AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy, the decrease of the ultimate tensile strength was moderate. A joint efficiency of about 89% at a welding speed of 50 mm/s and about 91% at a welding speed of 100 mm/s was achieved. The hardening capacity and strain hardening exponent increased after laser welding. A higher welding speed led to a higher yield strength and longer fatigue life, but slightly lower strain hardening exponent and hardening capacity due to the smaller grain size coupled with the eutectic structure containing

-Mg17Al12 precipitates in the fusion zone and smaller recrystallized grain size in the heataffected zone.

6. Both the strength and ductility of the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy after friction stir welding (FSW)
decreased at all the strain rates, with a joint efficiency lying in-between about 75% and 82%.

109

A slight increase of YS and UTS with increasing strain rate was observed, while the ductility in the base alloy decreased significantly. The welding speed and rotational rate had a stronger effect on the YS than the UTS. A higher welding speed of 20 mm/s and lower rotational rate of 1000 rpm led to higher YS, but lower ductility, strain-hardening exponent and hardening capacity. This was due to the smaller recrystallized grains in the low-hardness SZ arising from the lower heat input.

7. Both Mg/Mg and Al/Al similar FSS welds had significantly higher lap shear strength and
failure energy than the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld. While the Mg/Mg similar FSS weld exhibited a further higher lap shear strength than the Al/Al similar FSS weld, the Al/Al similar FSS weld could endure longer since the failure energy of the Al/Al similar FSS weld was greater than that of the Mg/Mg similar FSS weld. The Mg/Al and Al/Mg adhesive FSS welds had significantly higher lap shear strength and failure energy than the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld. The failure energy of the Mg/Al adhesive FSS weld was higher than that of the Al/Mg adhesive FSS weld.

8. While the fatigue life of the Al/Al similar FSS weld was generally higher than that of the
Mg/Mg similar FSS weld, both the Al/Al and Mg/Mg similar FSS welds had a much longer fatigue life than the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld especially at higher cyclic load levels. The Mg/Al and Al/Mg dissimilar adhesive FSS welds had a much longer fatigue life than the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld especially at higher cyclic load levels.

9. All the tensile fracture basically occurred in the fusion zone while fatigue failure occurred
mainly in-between the heat-affected zone and fusion zone. Cleavage-like flat facets together with tear ridges and river marking were observed in the welded samples. Small pores on the fracture surface of the fiber laser welded joints were observed. Fatigue crack initiated from

110

the near-surface welding defect. At lower stress amplitudes, single crack initiation was observed while multiple crack initiation was more evident at higher stress amplitudes. Fatigue crack propagation was characterized by the formation of fatigue striations with the spacing increased with increasing distance from the initiation site, in conjunction with the presence of secondary cracks.

10. Two distinct failure modes were observed to be dependent on the cyclic load level in the
similar FSS welds and dissimilar adhesive FSS welds. At higher cyclic loads nugget pullout failure occurred since fatigue crack propagated circumferentially around the nugget, while at lower cyclic loads fatigue failure occurred perpendicular to the loading direction due to the opening of the keyhole through crack initiation and then propagating at right angles to the loading direction. Fatigue crack propagation was characterized mainly by the formation of fatigue striations as well. Nugget debonding failure mode was observed in the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS weld. as a consequence of the presence of an intermetallic compound layer.

8.2. Major Contributions
The prime novel results in this study include:

1. After fiber laser welding (FLW) of AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy, the fusion zone (FZ) containing
divorced eutectic -Mg17Al12 particles as identified by XRD technique and the columnar dendrite zone near the FZ boundary were wider at a slower welding speed, and both the dendrite cell size in the FZ and heat-affected zone (HAZ) become larger which corresponding to the lower hardness, yield strength and shorter fatigue life.

2. After friction stir welding (FLW) of AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy, the basal planes (0002) in the stir
zone (SZ) tilted toward the transverse direction (TD) and rolling direction (TD), and the

111

prismatic planes (10 10) and pyramidal planes (10 11) formed fiber textures due to the severe shear plastic flow near the pin surface. Despite the lower ductility and hardening capacity, higher yield strength is achieved at a higher welding speed and lower rotational rate due to the smaller recrystallized grains and stronger basal texture in the stir zone.

3. After friction stir spot welding (FSSW) and friction stir spot adhesive welding of AZ31B-H24
Mg alloy and 5754-O Al alloy, the Al/Mg dissimilar FSS welds with/without adhesive were characterized by the formation of a distinctive interfacial layer consisting of Al12Mg17 and Al3Mg2 intermetallic compounds. The microhardness profile of the Mg/Mg similar FSS weld exhibited a W-shaped appearance, where the hardness gradually increased towards the keyhole direction. The Al/Al and Mg/Mg similar FSS welds and Al/Mg dissimilar adhesive FSS welds had significantly higher lap shear strength, failure energy and longer fatigue life than the Al/Mg dissimilar weld. Nugget pullout failure and fatigue failure were observed to be dependent on the cyclic load level in the Al/Al and Mg/Mg similar welds and Al/Mg dissimilar adhesive FSS welds. Nugget debonding failure mode was observed in the Al/Mg dissimilar weld.

8.3 Recommendation for Future Work
In the present study a number of joining methods were studied with special attention to the microstructural changes and mechanical properties. Different groups of FLWed and FSWed joints were compared and tested to identify the optimum welding parameters for maximizing the joint efficiency. The lap shear strength and fatigue resistance of the friction stir spot welded similar AZ31B-H24 and AA5754-O alloy, and dissimilar AZ31-to-AA5754 alloy joints with and

112

without adhesive were also evaluated and compared. However, more studies are needed in the aspect of joining technology on the Mg AZ31 alloy and Al 5754 alloy.

1. In the FLW process only two welding conditions were utilized to evaluate the microstructure
and mechanical properties. More systematic studies need to be done by increasing or decreasing the welding speed. It is assumed that after FLW, texture of the welding zone was changed completely or partly from the BM. Texture identification on the fracture surface or weld zone by XRD would be a piece of interesting research work.

2. In the FSW the mechanical properties among the three groups of joints were not significantly
different. This might be related to the base material having only 2 mm thickness. Thicker material should be welded with a large change of welding parameters to better examine the change in the mechanical properties among the FSWed joints made with different welding parameters.

3. In the present study, the YS and UTS were observed to increase with increasing welding
speed and decreasing rotational rate during FSW. However, the optimal welding parameters to achieve the maximum YS and UTS need to be identified.

4. The lap shear strength and fatigue resistance of the friction stir spot welded similar AZ31BH24 and AA5754-O alloy, and dissimilar AZ31-to-AA5754 alloy joints with and without adhesive were conducted by using one welding condition only. More studies with varying welding parameters are needed.
