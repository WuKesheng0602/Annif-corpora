ASSESSMENT AND ENERGY BENCHMARKING FOR TWO ARCHETYPE SUSTAINABLE HOUSES THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE LONG TERM MONITORING Rupayan Barua Master of Applied Science Program of Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2010

Abstract
A long term monitoring system has been developed and implemented in the Sustainable Archetype House built at Kortright Conservation Centre of Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. To comprehensively monitor the energy performance and to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the mechanical systems over 300 sensors of various types were installed. These are sufficient for energy monitoring details in the twin houses. An expandable distributed data acquisition (DAQ) system has been adopted for monitoring and control purpose. Data analysis of House-B has been performed. Results of monitoring data of energy recovery ventilator (ERV), radiant in-floor heating system, total electrical energy consumption, photovoltaic (PV) system, micro combined heat and power (CHP) unit and evacuated tube solar collector are described in Chapter 5. The sensible and latent heat recovery of the ERV increased with the increase of indoor-outdoor temperature difference and specific humidity difference, respectively. Higher radiant in-floor heating demand is observed on the 3rd floor. One year of data of the 4.08 kWp photovoltaic (PV) system has been collected and annual electricity generation is 4160 kWh. The average thermal and electrical efficiency of Whispergen micro combined heat and power (CHP) unit achieved 80% and 7% respectively. The average overall efficiency achieved 87% (based on higher heating value of natural gas). The average instantaneous efficiency of evacuated tube solar collector achieved 74%.

Introduction and Objectives
1.1 Background
In the cold climate regions, the building sector is responsible for the major portion of energy consumption and GHG emission. The growing awareness of the transformation of fossil fuel sources of energy to renewable energy and the government efforts to control climate change are helping the building industry towards sustainable development and setting the national target for low energy buildings worldwide. Table 1.1 shows the planned energy targets of some European Union (EU) countries.

Country Austria Denmark France Germany Hungary Ireland Italy

Year By 2015 By 2020 By 2020 In 2020 From 2020 After July 1, 2008 In 2010

Planned Energy Target Social housing subsidies will be available for passive buildings. All new buildings should use 75% less energy than current building regulations (base year: 2006). All new buildings should produce more energy than they consume. All new buildings should be operated without using any fossil fuel. All new buildings should be zero emission buildings. All new buildings are of a low-energy standard. All new buildings should have an approximately 10% reduction from the 2008 standard U-value. All new buildings should be energy neutral. Passive house standard will be required as minimum standard. Reduction of CO2 emission by 10% from 1990 level, limiting the growth of electricity consumption to a maximum of 5% over the 2000 level and doubling the new renewable forms of energy used in electricity and heat production. 25% better than current regulations. 44% better i.e. similar to PassiveHaus. Zero carbon for all energy including appliances.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Technology Program (BTP) set the target of net-zero energy residential houses by 2025 (US Department of Energy, 2009). The Council of Energy Ministers in Canada also set a target: by 2030, all new homes will be built to net zero energy standards (Marrone, 2007). In Canada, buildings consume 33% of total energy production, use 50% of Canada's natural resources and emit 35% of GHGs into the atmosphere. The residential building sector is also responsible for approximately 80 megatons of CO 2 emissions annually (Miller et al., 2008). In this regard, various advanced technologies have been adopted for efficient energy uses, less energy wastage, higher home comfort and low GHG emission. The government also attaches a great importance to energy conservation by providing encouraging initiatives, rules and regulations. The leaders in the residential construction sector are also starting to look at alternative mechanical systems and renewable energy sources as means to maintain their market position. In this regard Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada have been playing a pioneering role in energy efficient housing. The latter organization sponsored the building of the first super insulation demonstration house in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1977. The Saskatchewan house was cube shaped, equipped with an air to air heat exchanger for ventilation and had no furnace (Parker, 2009). The former organization launched the Advanced House program in 1991. Ten R-2000 standard advanced houses were constructed across Canada at the end of 1992. During 1993, all houses were open to the public for a one-year demonstration, then sold and finally monitored for a one-year period under normal occupancy (Stover, 1994). In 2007, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) took the initiative for 15 net zero energy home projects as the "CMHC EquilibriumTM Sustainable Housing Demonstration Initiative". Once the projects are finished, the homes will be open to the public for at least six months for demonstrations, then they will be sold and performance monitoring will be started for one year with full occupancy (CMHC, 1996). In Ontario, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) plays an important role in green education and the promotion of green buildings. Along with the Building Industry and Land Development (BILD) Association, they have implemented the "Sustainable Archetype House" project at The Living City Campus at Kortright Centre in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. This Archetype Sustainable House is designed to demonstrate viable, sustainable housing

technologies in the near and medium terms through research, demonstration, education, training, market transformation and partnership programs (TRCA and BILD, 2009).

1.2 Objectives
In order to evaluate the benefits from various structural and mechanical advancements, it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive monitoring on every aspect of thermal performance in the TRCA twin houses. The specific objectives of the monitoring are listed below:   From energy point of view, comparison of current practice and technologies in House-A and sustainable technologies of future practice in House-B Comparison of different HVAC technologies that are used in both houses, e.g., two stage air source heat pump in House-A and ground source heat pump in House-B, boiler in House-A and micro CHP unit in House-B, HRV in House-A and ERV in House-B and so on.   Performance evaluation of each piece of mechanical equipment and compare with the manufacturer manual Calibrate the simulation result against gathered data from experiment according to the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO), 2007)  From the experimental result build a model benchmarking, which will be used to design of new sustainable houses

1.3 Literature review
There is growing awareness worldwide about energy conservation and transformation to clean energy generation for meeting residential house energy demands. In this regard, several monitoring projects have been conducted in the past few decades to assess the actual energy consumption of newly built sustainable houses. The Northwest Power Planning Council, Oregon, USA developed the Model Conservation Standards (MCS) in 1983 to save large amounts of space heating energy in the houses of the Northwest Pacific region of the U.S (Parker, 1989). Under the Residential Standards Demonstration Program (RSDP) in 1984, 410 energy-efficient single-family homes in the states of Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho were constructed. The design features of these houses were high levels of insulation for the attic, walls and floors,
3

triple-glazed windows and airtight construction with a mechanical ventilation system by means of a heat recovery unit. These MCS houses have been compared with another group of 410 newly built conventional technology houses in the same region. Each house was monitored for at least one year. Monitored space heating energy savings of the MCS over newly built conventional houses averaged 27.5 kWh/(m2-yr) (8.72 kBtu/ft2-yr). It was found that space heating consumption is a function of overall heat loss coefficient of the building and the cumulative temperature difference between inside and outside temperatures. Forced air heating systems performed poorly relative to others. Heat pumps showed lower space heating electricity consumption. Homes heated primarily with wood stoves showed much lower space heating electricity consumption. The average temperature in the main living room of the energy-efficient MCS houses was 0.8C (1.44F) warmer than newly built conventional houses. Similar studies have been conducted in Kirov, Russia. Matrosov et al., (1994) mentioned that, as Russia moved toward a market economy, it was increasingly important to understand the energy characteristics of residential houses because of fuel supply conditions and continuous price fluctuations. Their growing concern is that single family houses in the middle zone of Russia consume about 600-800 kWh/(m2-yr) (190 Â­ 253.5 kBtu/ft2-yr) of primary energy. Whereas in Germany, average single family houses consume 250 kWh/(m2-yr) (79 kBtu/ft2-yr), in Sweden, the figure is 135 kWh/(m2-yr) (43 kBtu/ft2-yr). Highly efficient single family houses in Germany consume only 90 to 120 kWh/(m2-yr) (28.5 to 38 kBtu/ft 2-yr). The Research Institute for Buildings Physics (NIISF) of Gosstroy, Russia and the US-based Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) established a joint collaboration on energy efficiency studies of buildings in 1988. They constructed a standard two-storey, unoccupied single-family house with three rooms on the first floor and two rooms on the second floor. The floor area of this house was 112.8 m2 (1,214 ft2). This fabricated house was assembled in Kirov, where the average winter temperature is -5.8C (21.56F), and the duration of the heating season is 231 days. The design features of this model house included a 160 mm thick wall structure, and it was composed of three-tier panels and a wooden-frame work. Windows were double-glazed with a coupled-type double sash. The floor structure was composed of decking on joists. Gaps between joists were filled with mineral wool. The roof used the same insulating materials as the floors. This house was equipped with nine electric radiators of 1 kW (3.41 MBH) capacity each for space heating. After monitoring it was found that there was a linear correlation of energy consumption with the indoor and outdoor
4

temperature difference. Another outcome of their study was that reduced infiltration and increased shell insulation provided low energy consumption. They suggested that, a good level of air tightness would be possible if frost-resistant weather stripping between the sash and frame of the window, and sealant between sash and glass were used. Air tightness can also be improved by caulking around the windows, joints between wall panels, between the panels and ceiling, and between panels and the first floor. This combination should reduce annual specific heating energy consumption by 37% from 448 to 253 kWh/(m2-yr) (142 to 80 kBtu/ft 2-yr) when electric heating is used. Another study has been conducted in Germany. Doreen et al., (2009) conducted comprehensive research on among others, 10 low-energy non-residential buildings with net floor area range of 1700-21,500 m2 (18,292 Â­ 231,340 ft2), one office building with area of 950 m2 (10,222 ft2) and one residential building with total area of 300 m2 (3,228 ft2). This project was spearheaded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) under an intensive research program "Energy-Optimized Buildings" or EnoB. The objective of their study was to analyze the end and primary energy as well as auxiliary energy use of these buildings with regard to heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting. The residential house was a two-person household. It had a total heated net floor area of 294 m2 (3163 ft2) and the surface area to volume ratio was 0.63 m-1. The design features of the envelope systems were for exterior walls 0.12 W/(m2.K), with window ratio of 38% of faÃ§ade area. In the mechanical system, this house employed environment friendly energy sources and energy sinks Â­ such as the ground, rainwater and the ambient air. The rain water was collected in two cisterns. A ground source heat pump was used for space heating. In the mechanical ventilation system, supply air was conditioned by an earth-to-air heat exchanger which pre-heated the incoming fresh outdoor air in winter and pre-cooled it in summer. Cistern water was used as a heat sink in summer. After monitoring in 2007, the total annual primary energy consumption of this newly constructed residential house was 55 kWh/(m2-yr) (17.43 kBtu/ft2-yr) without lighting energy consumption. In addition, about 30% of the annual auxiliary energy was used for primary pump operation, energy distribution and delivery systems. The other findings of this study on the minimization of auxiliary energy requirements are: i) Pumps that can be controlled according to heating and cooling demand, ii) employed high efficiency pumps, iii) select accurately sized pumps with respect to pressure drop, iv) adjustment of the volume flow rate according to the heating and cooling demand, v) hydraulic adjustment (small
5

pressure losses) within the primary cycle, vi) pump operation only when required and vii) sufficient control algorithms. Different net zero and near zero energy projects in the U.S. have been described by Parker (2009). He mentioned that in the late 1980s, the cost of solar electricity production by photovoltaic systems declined which made the opportunity to use them in the residential housing sector. In the early 1990s, the Florida Energy Center undertook a simulation exercise in this regard and determined that photovoltaic systems could help make annual net zero energy homes possible. He also added that following the concepts of solar resources, some net zero energy houses were built across the U.S. A few examples are i) Lakeland, Florida in 1998, ii) Solar Patriot, Washington DC in 2001, iii) Livermore, California in 2002, iv) Lenoir City, Tennessee in 2002-05, v) Armory Park del Sol in Tucson, Arizona in 2003, vi) Wheat Ridge, Colorado in 2005, vi) Community level project in Sacramento, California in 2005. A near zero energy house research project was built in Lenoir City, Tennessee, near Knoxville. The Habitat for Humanity (HfH) house ZEH 3 in this project was designed to surpass the energy consumption efficiency set forth by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Building America benchmark house model by 50% (Christian et al., 2006). This research project consisted of five houses. The design process for this series of five near zero-energy houses started at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The floor area of the houses varies from 100 m2 (1056 ft2) to 111.5 m2 (1200 ft2). The nomenclatures of the five houses were: Base House, ZEH 1, ZEH 2, ZEH 3, and ZEH 4. The discussion here focuses on the ZEH 3 house, which has a total floor area of 100 m2 (1060 ft2). This house features structural insulated panels (SIP), geothermal space heating and cooling and a 2 kW grid tied roof-top photovoltaic system, which had a construction cost of less than $100/ft2. A total of 49 sensors were used to capture the continuous thermal and energy performance of this house. This house was monitored for more than two years of occupancy from December 2003 to 2005. After two years of monitoring, it was found that the PV system produced 24% of the total required energy. The house was heated and ventilated according to the ASHRAE standard 62.2 (ASHRAE, 2004) in the winter of 2003-2004 for less than $40. The total energy use of the house was 11,000 kWh/yr (37,510 kBtu/yr) while a traditional home of similar area consumed around 26,970 kWh/yr (91,968 kBtu/yr). In 2005 it had a net daily cost for off-site energy of only $0.79 (based on the local electric rate of

6

$0.068/kWh). Parker (2009) summarised from this project a variety of efficient building methods and technologies such as:        Heat pump water heater linked to the refrigerator for heat recovery. Unvented crawl space controlled by the thermostat for supplemental space cooling and dehumidification in the summer and as radon mitigation in the heating mode. Ground source heat pump using foundation heat recovery. Structural insulated panels throughout. Interior duct system within the insulated envelope. High performance windows, efficient appliances. Grey water heat recovery system.

Similar, but a different study has been conducted in Canada. Located in Ottawa, the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology (CCHT) house is one of these. This project consists of two sideby-side identical houses built in 1998. One is the reference house and the other one is the test house. Both houses have two storeys and each one has a total floor area of 210 m2 (2260 ft2). To evaluate the performance of these two R-2000 certified houses, a comprehensive monitoring system was employed and more than 300 sensors were implemented. Simulated occupancy of four family members was used in the houses. The long term monitoring results have been used in the model benchmarking, used to predict residential energy performance for different locations across Canada (Swinton et al., 2001). Another similar study is the Mattamy homes project in Milton, Ontario. This project consists of two houses built in 2005: one house is known as "The Wellington" and the other is known as "The Standbury". Both houses are equipped with solar thermal collectors and grey water heat exchangers to recover drain water heat. The Wellington house has a solar thermal collector integrated ground source heat pump for space heating and cooling and a photovoltaic (PV) system for power generation. The Standbury house uses a two-stage high efficiency natural gas furnace with ECM motor and SEER 14 central A/C for space heating and cooling. Hot water is produced by the solar thermal collectors with a natural gas mini boiler as backup (Cohen, 2010). A short study has been conducted in the Factor-9 home in Regina, Canada. This is a one-storey R-2000 certified single family house. This house has a floor area of 301 m2 (3239 ft2) where four occupants are living. Passive solar systems are employed for space heating, and ground source
7

energy is used for space cooling. The energy performance of this house was monitored for only one year from June 1, 2007 to May 31, 2008. The measured annual energy consumption of the house was 33.1 kWh/(m2-yr) (10.5 kBtu/ft 2-yr). This amount was 10 times less than homes in Regina built from 1970-73 (Dumont, 2008). A research project on near net-zero energy demonstration homes named ÃcoTerra has been conducted in Quebec. This is one of the fifteen CMHC Equilibrium Demonstration projects. This is a 240 m2 (2600 ft2) prefabricated home assembled in 2007 in Eastman, Quebec. The envelope of this house is well insulated and air tight. The combined resistance of the walls is RSI 6.6 (R37.5) and the ceiling is RSI 9.5 (R-54.2). Blower door test result showed 0.8 ACH at 50 Pa. This is a south facing house utilizing passive solar heating, where 40% of the south facing facade is covered with triple glazed windows. The house is equipped with a building-integrated photovoltaic-thermal system (BIPV/T) on the roof which generates 2.8 kW of electricity and 10 kW of thermal energy. The house has a concrete slab in the basement, which contains air channels that allow the slab to absorb heat from the hot air heated by BIPV/T collector. This slab acts as a thermal mass, i.e., during the day the slab stores solar heat gain and releases it gradually at night. This house has a ground source heat pump for heating and cooling, waste water and ventilation air heat recovery systems. All appliances are energy efficient. This house is being monitored by a research team from Concordia University (Solar Buildings Research Network, 2007).

House Description
The Archetype House is a semi-detached twin-house. Two different sets of HVAC systems were installed in each of these twin houses: current practice and technologies in House-A, and sustainable technologies for future practice in House-B. Each house is attached to a garage. An in-law suite is built above the garage of House-B. Figure 2.1 shows the south side view of the Archetype Sustainable House with House A on the left-hand side and the in-law suite on the extreme right. Both houses are R-2000 and LEED Platinum certified (Dembo et al., 2010).

Figure 2.1 South-west views of the Archetype Sustainable twin houses

Although both houses are built based on the R-2000 standard, there are a few differences in the insulation, windows and mechanical systems. A comparison of the HVAC system among different housing standards is given in Table 2.1. Blower door tests have been conducted in both houses by Dembo et al. (2010). The air tightness in House-A is 1.317 ACH@50 Pa and in House-B is 1.214 ACH@50 Pa.

2.1 HVAC system of House-A
Figure 2.2 shows the ventilation and hydronic system of House-A. This house features with a one-tank hot water system. This tank has two coils: one is connected to a flat plate solar collector and the other is connected to the wall mounted mini boiler for backup supply. A two-stage air-toair source heat pump is used to supply warm/cold air for space heating/cooling. The air source heat pump is connected to the air handling unit (AHU), which has a variable speed blower and supplies forced air to the zones above the basement. If the heat pump cannot supply sufficient heat to the space during low outdoor temperature, the mini boiler will start to supply hot water to the heating coil of the AHU for supplementary heat to the zone. The return warm water will circulate in the radiant in-floor heating system for basement space heating. In the mechanical ventilation system a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) is used for heat recovery from the stale air. A grey water heat exchanger was installed to recover heat from drain water. Detail specifications of equipment/appliances, manufacturer/distributor and model number are shown in Tables 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.

2.2 HVAC system of House-B
Figure 2.3 shows the more advanced HVAC systems of House-B. A two-tank system was adopted for hot water production. One is a preheat tank and the other is a time-of-use (TOU) tank. The preheat tank is heated by an evacuated tube solar collector and the TOU tank has two electric coils for back up hot water generation. Desuperheater of GSHP also generates hot water. The radiant in-floor heating system is used for space heating in each floor. A ground source heat pump (GSHP) is connected to two horizontal loops in the yard. In the cooling season, the GSHP supplies chilled water to the multi-zone AHU. A Stirling engine based micro combined heat and power (CHP) unit substitutes for the GSHP during the winter months. This CHP unit can generate electricity and hot water at the same time. Because this unit is thermal load based, it is not operated in the cooling season. A buffer tank is used in between the GSHP/CHP and the infloor system/AHU to minimize short cycling. There is a roof-top PV system, and wind turbine for renewable energy production. An energy recovery ventilator (ERV) was installed in the mechanical ventilation system. A grey water heat exchanger was installed for grey water heat recovery. There is a 10 m3 (2642 USG) underground cistern in the field that collects rain water for toilet flushing and gardening. Detail specifications of equipment/appliances,

manufacturer/distributor and model number are shown in Tables 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10.

2.3 HVAC system of In-law suite
The in-law suite is a separate living room above the garage. It is interconnected with House-B via a wooden platform. The unique feature of the mechanical system of this suite is the solar wall. Return air from the room passes through the solar wall, receiving heat and re-circulating as warm air into the room. In addition, there is an integrated HRV and AHU unit for the ventilation system. The function of this integrated unit is to draw fresh air from outdoors into the HRV core so that the energy from the outgoing stale air is transferred to the incoming fresh air. The conditioned fresh air is then blended with the circulating air of the heating/cooling system and distributed to the living areas of the home through the supply ductwork. Hot and cold water are supplied to the integrated unit from the buffer tank of House-B in the heating and cooling seasons. The detail specifications, manufacturer/distributor and model number of equipment are shown in Table 2.11.

Monitoring system
Monitoring projects range from broad research studies to very specific savings verification. The TRCA Archetype House monitoring project is developed for broad research studies. Monitoring priority is given to performance evaluation of different mechanical equipment, whole house energy consumption and on-site renewable energy production rather than envelope retrofit performance. For development of this monitoring project ASHRAE Standards and Codes for energy monitoring in buildings have been followed (ASHRAE, 1999). In the monitoring project, the following activities are involved (ASHRAE, 1999):     Project planning Installation of sensors and data acquisition equipment Calibration, ongoing data collection, and verification Data analysis and reporting.

3.1 Project Planning
For planning of this monitoring system, the following information was collected:       Design characteristics of the house Envelope features Specifications of HVAC systems, i.e., duct sizes, fan capacity, maximum ventilation rate etc. Mechanical equipment installation layout Specifications of hydronic systems, i.e., flow rate, range of operative temperature, sizes of pipes, fittings, pump etc. Equipment specifications and their controlling systems

After collecting the above information, necessary equations for equipment performance were incorporated, and based on these equations relevant sensors and monitoring points were selected. The monitoring points for the mechanical system are demonstrated in Figures 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1.

20

3.2 Installation of Sensors
In both houses, over 300 sensors of various types covering sufficient energy monitoring details have been installed. Sensor installation strictly follows the manufacturer 's instruction to avoid any electrical damage and inaccurate readings of the signal. For instance, air temperaure/relative huimidity sensors are located away from the bend of ducts or the inlet of fans to ensure uniform flow. A summary of monitored components and their required inputs are provided in Table 3.1.

The connection between the sensors and the connector block of the DAQ system are installed according to the National Instruments (NI) supplied circuit diagram. These sensors are properly connected to the chassis of DAQ system. Two ends of each wire of the respective sensors are properly labelled and recorded (Appendix A).

3.3 Installation of Data Acquisition (DAQ) Systems
The DAQ system is very flexible in layout so as to have distributed sub-central DAQ. In this way, the wiring of sensors can be significantly reduced and the associated signal interference can be minimized. The DAQ system consists of backplane, controller, module, connector block, power supplier, LabVIEW software platform and the computer. The selection of modules depends on the output signal of sensors. This output signal is converted into corresponding engineering units by the LabVIEW software (Table 3.2).

As the houses are extensively wired from different locations, a flexible and expandable distributed DAQ system is essential to obtain good quality data with minimal noise. The NI Compact FieldPoint system is an ideal system which provides an easy-to-use, highly expandable programmable automation controller (PAC) composed of rigid I/O modules and intelligent communication interfaces. The Compact FieldPoint I/O modules filter, calibrate, and scale raw
23

sensor signals as well as performing self-diagnostics. Figure 3.2 shows the central DAQ system located in the mechanical room of the basement of each house, where the majority of the sensors are installed. In addition, each floor is equipped with a distributed chassis to collect room stratification air temperature and floor temperature data. The in-law suite of House B also has a dedicated chassis to process various signals, including a solar wall air heater, AHU, photovoltaic system and wind turbine. An external chassis is well insulated and located on the ground field to connect the soil sensors as well as the RTD sensors.

All Compact Field Point (CFP) or chassis is connected to the central computer through a network hub. As such, sensor data is captured by the LabVIEW software platform and sensors are addressed in this software according to the nomenclature (Appendix A). The sensors output mentioned in Table 3.2 are converted into corresponding engineering units by software. For instance, the pressure transducer output is 4 to 20 mA corresponding to 0 to 1  of water column (WC) of pressure. With this value, an equation is implemented into the LabVIEW program, which converts the mA signal to air flow rate in CFM (cubic feet per minute). With the
24

LabVIEW program, all equipment performance can be evaluated as well. Collected data sampling frequency will be adjusted in this program according to the actual requirement of data acquisition.

3.4 Calibration of Sensors
Calibration is the process of mapping raw sensor readings into corrected values by identifying and correcting systematic bias. Sensor calibration is an inevitable requirement due to the natural process of decadence and imperfection. Calibration is a technically challenging task mainly due to the existance of random noise and the absence of suitable error models (Feng et al., 2003). In the calibration process of this monitoring system, the off-line calibration technique is applied for temperature sensors. In the context of off-line calibration, the collected data has two components: raw sensor readings and data captured by high quality and high-cost light wieght calibrators measuring the same set of readings. The second set of data serves as the standards of what the sensors should measure. The goal of the off-line calibration is to determine a compact function that provides the mapping from the raw sensor reading to correct values (Feng et al., 2003). Table 3.3 shows calibrators which are used to calibrate different kinds of sensors.

3.4.1 Temperature sensors
Three types of RTD temperature sensors are used for the measurement of liquid temperature: i) Pt-500 series immersed T RTD sensors, ii) Pt-100 series direct immersed RTD sensors and iii) Pt-100 series surface mounted temperature sensors. Two sources of reference temperature were used for the calibration, i.e. a) ice water and b) handheld dry-wells. 3.4.1.1 Ice water: Pure water at sea level (full atmospheric pressure) freezes at 0C (32F) and boils at 100C (212F) (Kuphaldt, 2009). Hence, ice water at 0C (32F) was used as the reference temperature for the calibration of immersed type Pt-100 and Pt-500 temperature sensors. RTD sensors were connected with the MICROCAL calibrator. Readings were taken when the temperature reaches steady state. Theoretically the reading of sensors in the ice water should be 0C (32F), but Figure 3.3 shows that with thermowell the readings varied between 0.63C (33.13F) and 0.77C (33.39F) for Pt-500 T sensor and -0.32C (31.42F) to 0.22C (32.4F) for Pt-100 sensors. Without thermowell the lowest reading difference is 0.03C (0.05F) for both type of sensors. The main limitation of using pure water as calibrated standard is that it can calibrate at only 0C (32F) and 100C (212F). It is not possible to calibrate at other temperatures. Hence, a handheld dry-wells calibrator is used.

Figure 3.3 Calibrated results of Pt-500 and Pt-100 RTD probe based on 0C ice water

3.4.1.2 Handheld Dry-wells: This calibrator can create accurate calibration temperatures in the instrument. This device uses metal blocks with blind holes drilled for the insertion of temperature sensors (Kuphaldt, 2009). With the help of this equipment, all T direct immersed temperature sensors (Pt-500) were calibrated from set point 0C (32F) to 90C (194F) with 10 intervals. Figure 3.4 shows that without thermo-well most of the Pt-500 sensors temperature difference have ranged 0.6C (1.08F) to 0.8C (1.44F) from the set point temperatures. Similar results have shown in Figure 6, i.e., temperature difference have ranged 0.6 C (1.08F) to 0.8C (1.44F) at 0C (32F).

Figure 3.4 Calibrated result of Pt-500 RTD probe based on Handheld Dry-wells temperature settings

Pt-100 series direct immersed temperature sensors were calibrated from set point 0C (32F) to 90C (194F) with 10 intervals. Figure 3.5 shows that without thermo-well few sensors temperature difference have the ranged from 0.77C (1.39F) to 0.93C (1.67F) and others have 0.32C (1.58F) to 0.39C (1.70F).

27

Figure 3.5 Calibrated result of Pt-100 RTD probe based on Handheld Dry-wells temperature settings

Following the same procedure, all 26 Pt-500 and 16 Pt-100 temperature sensors were calibrated. The offset value of each RTD sensor were set to the LabVIEW program. The calibration data of three kinds of temperature sensors were also analysed according to the off-line calibration system (Feng et al., 2003). Figure 3.6 shows that, as the temperature rises, the sensors temperature increases linearly. From this linear relation an equation is set up for Pt-100 series surface mounted RTD sensors and implemented into the LabVIEW program.

28

Figure 3.6 Off-line calibrated result based on Handheld Dry-wells temperature settings

3.4.2 Air-Temperature (AT) sensors: These sensors were calibrated with a referenced
surface mounted (Pt-100) temperature sensor. This reference sensor was pre-calibrated by the Handheld Dry-wells. During calibration, the tips of both sensors were put adjacent to each other to ensure the accuracy of the temperature readings. AT sensors readings were taken from the LabVIEW program. The referenced sensor reading was taken from the MICROCAL 20DPC calibrator. In this process, more readings were collected for better accuracy.

3.4.3 Pressure transducer: Air flow rate sensor of circular duct consists of two parts. Pitot
tube which gives duct pressure difference in inch of water and pressure transducer converts it to mA signal. Monitoring software LabVIEW convert it to air flow rate in CFM. Pressure transducer output in mA is calibrated by the MICROCAL 20DPC calibrator and Ammeter. The pressure transducer output range from 4 to 20 mA corresponding to 0 to 1 of water column (WC). The reading of the lowest output signal of each sensor was measured. A linear equation was obtained within the calibration range and implemented into the LabVIEW program. The ouput value from the linear equation in CFM is cross-checked by the hot-wire thermo29

aneamometer (model: Mini air HW PRO-VT50). The probe of this calibrator was inserted into the duct and measured the velocity at different points across the duct. Figure 3.7 shows the air velocity profile of 15 cm (6 inch) return air duct of ERV. By this method, average air flow rate was evaluated of 48.40 Litre/sec (102 CFM) and at the same time, actual average reading by the monitoring software was 47 Litre/sec (99 CFM), which was 3% less than aneamometer reading.

Figure 3.7 Air velocity of 15 cm (6 inch) return air duct of ERV

Although the velocity of air changed continuously, a high flow rate was observed at the centre of the duct. The avergae velocity of the duct was then converted into the air flow rate in CFM by multiplying with the area of the duct cross-section. Practically, it is very hard to get an exact flow rate between these two kinds of calibration systems. In average, there is around Â±5% variation between these systems.

3.4.4 Water flow meter: The calibration of this sensor is done according to the NIST
(National Institute of Standards and Technology) guideline (NIST, 2009). The water that flowed through the sensor was collected in a volume bucket with the certain time step and then

30

compared with the saved data from the SQL database. This system was repeated three times for more accurate calibration results. Apart from the calibration of each sensor, error/uncertainty analysis is performed based on the manufacturer supplied sensors and calibrators accuracy value in Appendix B. Finally, it should be mentioned here that the calibration of sensors is an ongoing routine process to ensure data quality. This monitoring system will continue up to two years.

3.5 DAQ System -- Software 3.5.1 LabVIEW: Figure 3.8 is a snapshot of the front panel of the LabVIEW program. Both
low level (temperature, flowrate, RH, etc.) information and high level information (efficiency, effectiveness, heat generation, etc.) can be displayed on the front panel. Raw signals are converted and post-processed at the background of the front panel. All signals, except for power consumption signals, are acquired at a constant sampling time of 5 seconds, whereas a 0.5 second sampling time applies to the electrical power signal. For the flowrate and power consumption, both the rate and total value are calculated within the sampling period.

3.5.2 SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): It is a relational database
management system. The user can easily store, retrieve, and manipulate data in this software. Although storage capacity depends on the hard drive, this software has the database capacity of 524272 TB (Terabyte) (SQL Server, 2008)I. In this monitoring system, all data from the LabVIEW program are stored into the SQL server database directly. The database structure has three vertical columns which consists of Datestamp, Reading, and Channel. Hence, each row has three horizontal values. At 5 second intervals, each sensor captures 17285 rows/day data, equivalent to 356 KB (Kilobyte). Each day 300 sensors accumulate 107 MB (Megabyte) records. To deal with the large amount of data, this software has been selected.

Equations: Energy Consumption, Generation and Efficiency Calculation
For direct calculation in the LabVIEW software, basic equations of power, energy and efficiency of different equipment are illustrated. The sources of these basic equations are the ASHRAE handbooks, TRNSYS manual, different books and articles. In addition, some equations of density and specific heat of liquids, humidity ratio and enthalpy of air are also incorporated.

4.1 Water: Kravchenko (1966) stated that density of water is a function of temperature. He
described Equation (1) for pure water density. From 0C to 100C, its density varies from 999.82 kg/m3 to 950.05 kg/m3. Tanaka et al., (2001) determined the experimental result of water density from 0C to 40C. This result is compared with Equation (1), and Figure 4.1 shows that there is a good agreement between the equation and experimental results. Hence, Equation (1) is applied for density of water in thermal energy equations. Specific heat does not change greatly with temperature from 0C to 100C and the constant value of water is considered 4.1813 . (1)

Figure 4.1 Comparison of water density with temperature by Kravchenko Equation (1) and Tanaka et al. data

33

4.2 Propylene Glycol (PG) solution: PG and water solution (45:55) is used in the solar
loop as heat transfer media. From -12C to 104C, its density varies from 1060.46 kg/m3 to 968.20 kg/m3 and specific heat changes with temperature as well. The CHEM Group Inc II has supplied data for density and specific heat of PG. From this data, Equations (2) and (3) have been derived: (2) (3) The value of density is evaluated by Equation (2) and again compared with CHEM Group data. Figure 4.2 shows that there is a good agreement between CHEM group data and Equation (2) results.

loop of GSHP. The solution consists of 70% water and 30% PG. The working temperature range

of this solution might be from minimum 4C (Legget and Peckover, 1949) to a maximum of 24C (measured in the cooling season at site). Hence at low temperature range, the density of this solution (70:30) is considered as constant at 1026 kg/m3 (based on available information of temperature 15.55C) and its specific heat is 3.915
III

(The Engineering ToolBox, 2005).

4.4 Air: There are available basic equations of enthalpy and humidity ratio in terms of dry bulb
temperature and absolute humidity of air. Equations (4) and (5) are illustrated with dry bulb temperature and relative humidity of air (Padfield, 1996): (4) (5) The values of humidity ratio and enthalpy are evaluated using Equations (4) and (5) in the monitoring system. These values are compared with the Psychrometric calculator (Psychrometric Calculations, n.d.) ranging from air temperature -30C to 40C (increment 5C) and RH 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% 100%. There is a good agreement between these equations and the Psychrometric calculator. The comparison is shown in Figures C.1 Â­ C.12 at Appendix-C. Density of air changes with temperature. From -50C to 40C, its density varies from 1.534 to 1.127 kg/m3 IV. Specific heat of air is constant at 1.006 kJ/(kg.K) between these temperatures. From these air densities, Equation (6) has been derived:  (6)

It should be noted that all nomenclature of sensors and corresponding units are mentioned in Table 3.2. These units are followed in input values of all equations.

Data analysis
No occupant will live in the twin houses due to the nature of the project. However, the houses are open to the public for visit, and staff can work inside during the day. Therefore, both houses have occupants on the weekdays. The real time data being collected is similar to that in the typical family environment except household activities such as cooking, bathing and laundry. Simulated occupancy system is being implemented with typical residential conditions. The following main factors are considered for system performance analysis (Efficiency Valuation Organization, 2007):   outdoor and indoor temperature time intervals in seconds, hours or days

5.1 Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)
A tight building envelope system is often used in modern houses for energy conservation. Due to the reduction of infiltration in the air tight house, a proper mechanical ventilation system is essential for adequate indoor air quality and human comfort. The ASHRAE standard 62.2 (ASHRAE, 1999) recommends the minimum ventilation rate through the introduction of air-toair heat recovery system. Typical air heat recovery systems are Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) and Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV), which can filter fresh air, increase or decrease air temperature and/or humidity. An ERV is installed in House-B that can exchange both heat and moisture. Figure 5.1 shows that it consists of a polypropylene heat recovery core, air filters, and a single motor driven inlet and exhaust fan. In the heating season, a heat recovery core captures the heat and humidity from the stale air, and partly transfers them, to the incoming cold fresh air, thus avoiding the dryness problem and providing human comfort as well as saving energy. In the cooling season, the unit reverses the process, preventing the humidity from the outside air from entering the house. This unit totally blocks cross-stream transfer of air, pollutants, biological contaminants, and particulates from the stale air. It also prevents frost formation on the heat exchanger core when the outdoor temperature is below 0C (32F). To do this, the unit is programmed to defrost the recovery core. During the defrost cycle, the unit operates at maximum

48

speed and the dampers close. According to the manual, the duration of defrost cycling is 6 minutes. The defrost frequency varies according to the outdoor temperature.

Figure 5.2 shows the daily average indoor/outdoor temperatures and relative humidity from January 6 to 25, 2010. It was found that the average outdoor RH was 71% when the average temperature was -4.05C (24.71F). The absolute amount of moisture or water vapour in the cold air was only 2.59 g/m3 (1.62Ã10-4 lb/ft3). If the ERV were not installed, the incoming air would be extremely dry with only 13% RH at room temperature. With the ERV, moisture from the exhaust air was transferred to the incoming low moisture fresh air, and the RH value rose to 27%. According to ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2007, Walker and Sherman (2007) showed that the minimum ventilation rate can be determined from Equation (44). (44) From Equation (44), the ventilation rate for this 3-bedroom residential house should not be less than 64 CFM (30 L/s) and the optimum humidity range for human comfort should be 30%-60% (ASHRAE, 2000). However, as shown in Figure 5.2, indoor RH remains below 30% for that

49

period. The possible reasons of low RH value can be attributed to: a) high air exchange rate at low outdoor temperature, and b) low internal moisture generation (Walker and Sherman, 2007). It is worth noting that the ventilation rate through the variable speed ERV was kept at 148 CFM (70 L/s) during that period, which is high for a non-occupied house. The light human activity inside the house cannot provide sufficient moisture generation. Figures 5.3 and 5.4 show the sensible/latent heat recovery with respect to the indoor-outdoor conditions. As can be seen, the sensible heat recovery increases linearly as the dry bulb temperature difference increases. The latent heat recovery shows a similar trend with respect to the specific humidity difference, although a small discrepancy was observed. The supply and return air flow rate of ERV are not balanced. The average supply air flow rate is 1.14 times higher than the return air flow. The reasons for unbalanced air flow are mentioned in Chapter 6 section 8. To calculate efficiency, supply and return air flow rates are considered balanced. Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show the comparison of measured sensible/latent efficiency with manufacturer supplied data. In both figures, measured values are higher than the manufacturer values and differences increase with the decrease of outdoor temperature. The measured and manufacturer values of latent efficiency in Figure 5.6 are very close to each other.

5.2 In-floor radiant heating
In-floor radiant heating is a method of heating the space by applying heat underneath or within the floor. Olesen (2002) mentioned that a carpet is not necessary when using this system for space heating, which eliminates a source of pollutants. This is especially helpful for people with allergies. It was also mentioned that in a study, the German Allergy and Asthma Association has shown that this space heating system reduced the favourable living conditions for house dust mites compared to other heating systems. Elovitz (2001) stated that radiant in-floor heat is less prone to stratification but in other space heating systems, the hot air near the ceiling increases as the local indoor-outdoor temperature difference increases. Hence, claims that radiant heat produces appreciable savings by reducing temperature stratification. For space heating in HouseB, a radiant in-floor heating system is used in all floors. Figure 5.7 shows the "thin slab over frame floor" system that is used on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor of House B. A set of 1.25 cm (0.5 inch) diameter PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) tubing was stapled on the plywood subfloor at 23 cm (9.05 inch) centre to centre distance in the 6.5 cm (2.56 inch) thick cement slab. On top of the cement slab, a 1.5 cm (0.59 inch) thick finished wood floor was installed (Barua et al., 2010). Figure 5.8 shows that the in-floor radiant heating system maintained indoor temperature in winter at around 21C (69.8F). This is controlled by an actuator, which has a series of valves that control the hot water flow from the buffer tank to different zones as required. The actuator is operated by the controller, following a demand from the thermostat which makes a decision based on the indoor-outdoor temperature difference. The buffer tank holds warm water at constant temperature around 40C (105F) during the heating season. As shown in Figure 5.9, the space heating increases with the increase of indoor-outdoor temperature difference. Figure 5.10 shows that there is higher heating demand on the 3rd floor. Possible reasons can be attributed to the larger exposed surface area and the higher ceiling, where the highest level is 4.98 m (16 ft) away from the floor. Elovitz (2001) shows that the radiant in-floor heating system is popular in residential and light commercial buildings where the ceiling height is in the range of 2.4 m (8 ft) to 2.7 m (9 ft).

5.3 Total electricity consumption
Roth and Brodrick (2008) showed that occupant behaviour has a major impact on the building energy consumption. In the archetype houses, most of the appliances are not utilised in full capacity due to the absence of occupants. However, all mechanical and hydronic systems are operated in partial or full load capacity (Barua et al., 2010). Figures 5.11 and 5.12 show the total electricity consumption is mainly influenced by indoor-outdoor temperature difference, indicating that the space heating is the major factor for electricity consumption in the heating season.

5.3.1 Data validation: Total electrical energy consumption of House-B is measured by both
wattnodes and Google powerMeter. Wattnodes measures the pulse of electrical energy by the current transformer (CT), and through the data acquisition system LabVIEW software converts it to kWh. Collected data is saved in the SQL database. Google powerMeter is an energy

monitoring tool that enables users to view home energy consumption from anywhere online. It works by taking information from a smart energy meter installed in the home, tracking energy consumption and then sending the data to a user iGoogle homepage. Table 5.1 shows that there is a good agreement between these two different energy monitoring devices.

5.4 Photovoltaic (PV) system
A photovoltaic system is the direct conversion of sun light into electricity at the atomic level of certain materials. Those materials have a property known as the photoelectric effect, which means that they absorb photons of light and release electrons. When these free electrons are captured, electric current flows that can be used as electrical energy (Knier, 2002). A number of solar cells made of photoelectric materials are electrically connected to each other and mounted in a support structure or frame called a module. On the roof of House-B, the monocrystalline photovoltaic system composed of 48 modules was installed. Each module has a capacity of 85 W. The total cell area of all modules is 31.1 m2 (334.3 ft2) with combined generation capacity of 4.08 kW. Under standard test conditions (STC), the maximum efficiency of this PV system is 13.12%. Out of 48 modules, 16 modules were installed on the roof surface at a tilt angle (with respect to horizontal base) of 9.46, 24 modules at an angle of 11.77 and the remaining 8 modules at an angle of 33.69. All modules were grouped in 3 strings of 16 modules each, which were connected in series to a 5 kW single inverter. This inverter's efficiency is 95.5%. Figure 5.13 shows the typical system components and this PV system is grid connected. To determine the simulation result at different angles by RETScreen, the generation capacity of 4.08 kW is distributed according to the ratio of total cell area: 1.36 kW at angle 9.46, 2.04 kW at angle 11.77 and 0.68 kW at angle 33.69 (Barua et al., 2010).

One year of PV data from September 2009 to August 2010 were collected at Kortright Centre. The evaluation of yearly PV performance has also been conducted using RETScreen. Solar radiation of 20 years' averaged data at Pearson International Airport (PIA) weather station was used in the RETScreen analysis. These solar radiation data were compared with the available data at the University of Waterloo, University of Toronto (Mississauga campus) and Kortright
58

Figure 5.13 Grid-Interactive PV system without battery backup

Conservation Centre weather station, which is the closest station to both PIA and Kortright Centre. It shows that the solar radiation of one year data at the University of Waterloo weather station is 1.74% higher, University of Toronto (Mississauga campus) weather station is 1.56% higher and Kortright weather station is 1.79% higher than the 20-year average data at PIA using RETScreen. In the RETScreen help menu, maximum array losses due to dirt and snow accumulation are considered 20%. Unlike RETScreen, there are other losses which are mentioned in Table 5.2. There is no available standard PV losses information in Toronto weather conditions. Hence, to evaluate the difference of electrical energy between RETScreen and actual generation, losses of the PV system were set to zero in the analysis. The results show that yearly electricity generation is 4970 kWh in RETScreen. During one year, PV generated 4160 kWh electricity, which is 16.30 % less than the RETScreen prediction. Possible reasons for underproduction are listed in Table 5.2. Figure 5.14 shows monthly comparison between measured electricity generation and RETScreen from September 2009 to August 2010.

One year measured electricity generation by this system can prevent 0.80 MT of CO2 emission based on hourly average GHG emission factors (Gordon and Fung, 2009). The rule of thumb for Toronto's solar resources shows that each kW PV system can generate 1100 kWh/yr electricity (Exhibition Place, 2009). According to this rule, the existing 4.08 kW PV system can generate approximately 4488 kWh/yr electricity, which is 7.30% higher than the measured data. Figure 5.15 shows that average daily horizontal solar radiation (measured global radiation on horizontal surface) on 31.1 m2 PV cell is 15000 W and this array captured only 1662 W (DC) which means that performance only 11% (Figure 5.16) on April 04. But as mentioned earlier, the efficiency of this PV system is 13.12% under STC conditions. Baltus et al., (1997) mentioned underproductions in the PV system were caused by some losses due to interaction between the environment, the inverter and modules. Two different studies of PV losses on roof top grid connections are described in Table 5.2.

Figure 5.15 Horizontal solar radiation on 31.1 m2 PV cell and PV DC and AC output on April 04, 2010

In both studies, loss due to snow accumulation is absent but it is a major factor in Canada.

Recently Queen's University Applied Sustainability Research Group of Canada is conducting a study on PV losses due to snow fall on arrays. Data analysis is currently underway to determine the effects of snowfall on the array of panels (Queen's University Applied Sustainability Research Group, 2010).

*Standard Test conditions: Manufacturer rating of the module output often has a production tolerance of Â±5%. For a conservative estimate, it is best to use the lowest output.

5.4.1 Lesson learned from the analysis:
   Sometimes inverter efficiency shows more than 100%. This was observed on February 8 and 20, 2010. Although PV array capacity is 4080 W, on August 30, 2009 at 14:03:04 the Xantrex inverter data logger showed that its peak generation (4553 W) exceeded this limit. Figure 5.17 shows the relation among PV output, ambient temperature and horizontal solar radiation. When solar radiation increases, ambient temperature and PV output increases and vice-versa when it decreases.   When ambient temperature increases, PV efficiency (based on horizontal solar radiation) decreases (Figure 5.18). King et al., (2002) mentioned that PV performance changes with cell temperature. Both the electrical current generated by the PV cell and its voltage are independently influenced by operating temperature. Figures 5.19 and 5.20 show that as PV temperature increases, voltage typically decreases, current increases, and power generation increases.

5.4.2 Data validation Solar radiation: Solar radiation sensor data of House-B pyranometer is validated with the
University of Waterloo (UoW), University of Toronto (Mississauga campus) (UoT) and Kortright Conservation Centre weather station. The variation of House-B pyranometer data is 5.09% less than UoW, 11.04% less than UoT and 7.16% less than the Kortright weather station from June 01 to 27, 2010. Figure 5.21 shows average horizontal solar radiation (global radiation measured on horizontal surface) from June 01 to 27, 2010.

Figure 5.21 Comparison of average horizontal solar radiation among Kortright center (House-B), University of Waterloo (UoW), and University of Toronto (Mississauga Campus) (UoT) and Kortright weather station from June 01-27, 2010

PV output: PV output is measured by wattnode sensors and PV inverter (Xantrex) built-in
data logger. PV output during November 20 to 23 from both Xantrex inverter and Wattnodes were analysed. Wattnode reading indicated that there was a small amount of PV output at the night. However this output was not recorded in the Xantrex inverter. The reason is that any signal less than 4 mA will not be recorded in Xantrex. If excluding the readings during the night, data recorded from both sensors show very good agreement (Figure 5.22).

5.5 Micro Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit
The micro Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit produces heat and electricity simultaneously. Due to its dual production, high efficiency, low maintenance, light weight, low noise/vibration, and low GHG emission nature, it is becoming popular in the residential sector. Kuhn et al., (2008) mentioned that the micro CHP systems could provide 30-40% of the UK electricity demand by 2050. Hence, the UK government has reduced Value Added Tax (VAT) from 17.5% to 5% for households that install micro CHP systems. The Dutch government has taken similar initiatives. Hongbo and Gao (2009) reported that five countries Â­ Japan, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, and USA Â­ are currently most active in research and introduction of micro CHP systems in the residential sector. They also added that Japan and Germany are competing to lead the market. Onovwiona and Ugursal (2004) reviewed various cogeneration systems for residential use, mainly internal combustion (IC) engines, micro-turbine, fuel cell, and external combustion Stirling engines. Although the Whispergen micro CHP unit has not been approved yet by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the NRCan installed a unit in House-B of this project for long-term study.

This CHP unit is called a personal power station and consists of a Stirling engine. This is a reciprocating engine with 4 cylinders and double-acting. Its cylinders are closed and combustion takes place outside of the cylinder. The working principle of this unit is that burned nitrogen gas repeatedly heats and expands on top of the cylinder, and contracts the gas by water cooled lower part of the same cylinder that raises and lowers the pistons. As a result the rotation of the mechanical system rotates the alternator to generate the electricity. In addition, heat from the flue gas heats the water and cools the engine as well. According to the manual, this unit can produce up to 12 kW of thermal power for hot water generation at maximum temperature of 85C and 1 kW of electricity at the same time. It has two burners' one is the main burner and the other is the auxiliary burner. Gas consumption for maximum burner firing rate is 1.5m3/h. It can use any combustible fuel including biomass. The manufacturer claims that the combined heat and power efficiency is more than 90%. Figure 5.23 shows that the hot water is used for both space heating and domestic use. Certain modifications have been made during installation to accommodate the Canadian voltage standard. This unit generates 240V of AC electricity. A step down transformer was set up to downgrade the voltage to 110 V.

5.5.1Control strategy: To allow the solar collector output on the same DHWT for domestic
hot water (DHW) generation, the high set point is 40C and the low set point is 30C. For the buffer tank of radiant in-floor heating system, the high set point is 45C and the low set point is 35C. This control system is done by LabVIEW program.

5.5.2 Observations from the real time data: This unit was operated from April 6 to
May 17, 2010. The analysis has been conducted on the transient nature of this unit.   At the beginning of each on-cycle, water flow starts about one minute before the gas flow starts. At the end of each on-cycle, hot water generation continues after the gas flow stops. As a result, the number of on-cycle increases, thermal efficiency increases, and electrical efficiency decreases (Figure 5.28). The duration of hot water generation without gas flow depends on the set point temperature of the control system.   Figure 5.24 shows that the average thermal efficiency is 80% and electrical efficiency is 7%. The overall average efficiency is 87% (based on a higher heating value). This micro CHP unit can convert one cubic meter gas into about 0.69 kWh of electrical energy and 8.74 kWh of thermal energy, when the low-high set point temperature is 3040C for DHW and 35-45C for space heating.      Figure 5.25 shows, when the gas flow rate increases from 17 lpm, the overall efficiency decreases. There is no standby losses when this unit runs but when it idles, sometimes the losses cross even 400 W. An average standby energy loss is 0.69 kWh per day when it is idle. Figure 5.26 shows when it is running, the average electricity generation is 732 W. Figure 5.27 shows that the total 107 kWh of electricity generated and 11 kWh of standby/parasitic losses are accumulated from April 21 to May 10, 2010. During this period, based on the total electricity production, an average of 10% of parasitic/standby losses is observed. But, parasitic losses greatly depend on the number of on and off cycles. There is power consumption in the pumps, fans, and initial ignition of gas that is the cause of losses during the on and off cycles in every start.  There is an about 20% power loss after the voltage step down.

The overall performance of this unit depends greatly on the generated hot water utilization.

Similar studies on the Whispergen micro CHP unit have been conducted in Germany, France (Kuhn et al. 2008), and in the CCHT house, Canada (Entchev et al., 2004). Table 5.3 shows the outcome of the Whispergen micro CHP unit.

5.6 Evacuated tube solar collector:
An evacuated tube (heat pipe) solar collector is installed in the south side of House-B at a tilt angle with respect to horizontal base of 25. The gross, absorber and aperture area of this collector is 2.88 m2, 2.05 m2 and 2.11 m2, respectively. It consists of 20 evacuated tubes of each length of 1870 mm and diameter of 65 mm. Figure 5.29 shows the main components of solar collector of each tube contains a Sol-titanium coated copper absorber that ensures high absorption of solar radiation and low emission of thermal radiation. Pure water is used inside the copper tube as the heat transfer media from the absorber to the condenser, i.e. to Propylene Glycol (Figure 5.30).

It is found in ASHRAE (1999) that the performance of any solar thermal system depends on,    the heating load, the amount of solar radiation, and the solar thermal system characteristics.

European Commission Directorate General for Energy and Transport (2004) broadly mentioned that the most important factors affecting the performance of solar domestic hot water system are:      the collector area and efficiency the volume of storage tank the system design of heat exchanger and controller the solar radiation and air temperature the load, i.e., cold water temperature, volume, demand temperature.

ASHRAE (1999) also mentioned that the collector operation is regulated by a controller with the following glycol cycle: 1) overheating protection and 2) auxiliary heating when it is required. A differential controller is used in the current system, which regulates the above operations. The
73

control of the solar hot water system is that the glycol pump starts when the temperature difference between solar collector output and cold water inlet to the pre heat tank exceeds 12C. The instantaneous efficiency of this evacuated tube solar collector are analysed with Equation (30) and (45). According to the European Commission Directorate General for Energy and Transport (2004) recommendations, the efficiency curve for a solar collector should be presented as the second order polynomial Equation (45) of the variable T* = (Tm-Ta)/I (45) where  0 = optical efficiency, a1 = thermal loss coefficients in W/(m2.K), a2 = thermal loss coefficients in W/(m2.K2), I = solar radiation is greater than 800 W/m2 at a tilt angle of 25 (From RETScreen, ratio of horizontal to tilt angle of 25 solar radiation was determined, and this ratio of a particular month was used to calculate inclined solar radiation), T* = (Tm-Ta)/I, Tm = mean temperature (C) of PG = (Tin+Tout)/2, Ta = ambient temperature in (C). The European Commission used the mean temperature of inlet and outlet of PG (T m) in Equation (45) as T*= (T m-Ta)/I. The Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC Document, 1994) and the California Solar Initiative Program (The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), 2009) used T* = (Tin-Ta)/I, where Tin = inlet temperature (C) of PG. To determine the efficiency with Equation (45), the following values from the manual are applied (Vitotech technical guide, 2010):  0 = optical efficiency = 83.8%, a1 = thermal loss coefficients = 1.18 W/(m2.K), a2 = thermal loss coefficients = 0.0066 W/(m2.K2), Equations (30) and (45) are applied on the collected data from June 01-25, 2010 of solar collector. Figure 5.31 shows the instantaneous efficiency curve based on the above equations. The efficiency decreases with the increase of (T m-Ta)/I value. This trend is showing aforementioned two different efficiency equations. The efficiency of these two equations is very close to each other, but when the (Tm-Ta)/I value increases, the difference of efficiency between
the two equations increase. 74

Figure 5.32 shows that the difference of hot propylene glycol and ambient temperature increases with the increase of solar radiation.

5.6.1 System control: A differential controller is used to control the evacuated tube solar
collector. The control for the system is simple. The solar system is turned on by a difference between the collector outlet temperature and the domestic cold water temperature. If the collector outlet temperature raises 12C above the cold-water temperature, the pump is turned on. If the temperature difference falls below 12C, and the electronic temperature limit reaches maximum 95C at the control unit, the pump is turned off. The function of a temperature difference of controller relates to the collector and storage temperature.

tested and it is running successfully. Data collection and analysis is going on. It is a huge challenge to host these many sensors (300+) with different types of signal on a single machine. An efficient real-time structure was adopted and coded to process all signals at fast rates (0.5s). Data is recording in the SQL server database.

6.2 Problems found during implementation
1) Connection between connector and turbine type water flow sensors should strictly follow the manual instruction. Few sensors were damaged due to the wrong wiring. 2) Teflon tape falling inside the turbine type water flow sensors during installation in the hydronic line may result in the failure of such sensors. Special attention should be paid during the installation. 3) The air temperature and relative humidity sensor was installed upside down in the outdoor fresh air incoming duct. This position results in the moisture condensation on the electronic element, hence the failure of the sensor. 4) Duct air temperature measurement by the air temperature sensor is influenced by the surrounding temperature because of the suction of zone air through the sensors wire port. Therefore, tight sealing is required to minimize the air leakage. 5) The city main water temperature sensor was installed near to the water softening plant in the basement. Hence, the basement air temperature may easily influence the incoming city water temperature. Another RTD sensor should be installed outside the room. 6) Analysis for the solar collector has shown that there is energy back flow from the solar hot water tank to the glycol in the solar collector loop early in the morning.
78

7) Temperature measurement sensors for all three floors and basement infloor heating loop are installed in the infloor heating tube at the basement. Locations of these sensors are very close to each other except for the basement loop temperature sensors. As a result, when hot water flows from the buffer tank to a particular floor, there is heat exchanged through natural convection to other sensors. Sometimes, return temperature exceeds supply temperature. 8) Fresh air duct from the ERV was connected to the return air duct of the AHU. As a result,
the following problems are observed:

i)

Fresh air flow rate from the outdoors is higher than the return air from the zone when the AHU operates. Hence balanced air flow is not observed in the ERV. The AHU fan influenced the ERV fan for sucking more air from outdoors.

ii)

When the AHU runs without ERV operation, fresh air flow rate is observed in the ERV.

iii)

Controlling system of ERV and AHU is not integrated, i.e. the ERV runs without
the AHU. As a result, when the ERV runs without the AHU operation, fresh air

from the ERV passes through the return air duct of the AHU because the damper of supply air duct is closed. iv) To calculate the air flow rate in CFM from the duct air pressure difference for the ERV and AHU duct, a polynomial equation was set up in the LabVIEW software. In the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application: a six order polynomial trend line equation is prepared from Table 6.2 for circular type 0.1524 m (6) duct air flow station. This polynomial equation produces error as CFM. For instance, for the six inch duct air flow rate (CFM) = -40000000X6 + 30000000X5 Â­ 9000000X4 + 1000000X3 Â­ 104587X2 + 4991.4X + 4.0067 where X = pressure difference in inch of water In the same way, a six degree polynomial equation is prepared from Table 6.2 in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) mathematical software. This polynomial equation gives an accurate result. The accurate air flow rate (CFM) = 40323500X6 + 31386100X5 Â­ 9470840X4 + 1405890X3 Â­ 108999X2 + 5128.98X + 2.63522

9) There are two sensible efficiency equations of the ERV for balanced air flow. a) b) Although all sensors are calibrated properly, there is average 6 to 12% variation of sensible efficiency between these two equations. As mentioned before, air flow rates are not equal between return air from the zone to the ERV and leaving air from the ERV to the AHU. 10) PV output is measured by the two equipment, wattnodes and Xantrex PV inverter builtin data logger. Comparing output data from these two equipments, it is found that for higher PV output, variation is less than 1% and for lower PV output, variation is less than 5%. 11) Ground source heat pump (GSHP) compressor was out of order for the leakage of refrigerant tube from February 13 to June 17, 2010. The compressor was replaced later on and it is operating. 12) There is a leakage in the infloor radiant heating loop on the third floor. An investigation is underway to find the cause of leakage.

6.3 Author's contribution
It is a large monitoring project like Canadian Centre for Housing Technology (CCHT) house in Ottawa. In order to achieve objectives, described in Section 1.2 and to gather good experimental data, it is inevitable to have a powerful monitoring platform. In this regard, author finished following activities for last two years to build a complete monitoring platform:  For direct calculation in the LabVIEW software, basic equations of power, energy and efficiency of different equipment were illustrated       Selection of sensors and their locations are based on the energy balance equation of respective equipment All sensors were calibrated, especially temperature and flow sensors Implementation of sensor and data acquiring system and commissioning Validating the collected data by cross-checking Thermal performance analysis of equipment/system, and the result is compared with the manufacturer's manual and different publications Determination of the errors of all measured and derived data through uncertainty analysis

6.4 Future work
As an on-going monitoring project, the following work will be carried out:    Validation of collected data to ensure the accuracy of data. Obtaining the base case information without any occupant living in the house. Comparing the base case with the occupancy case where occupants of a typical family will live in the house in one summer month and one winter month. The effects of typical resident behaviour on the energy performance of the house can be studied.     Comprehensive performance analysis of each piece of equipment should be done. Using building simulation software to simulate the energy performance of the house and its equipment. Creating new components or subprograms to improve the existing building simulation software. The data and the improved models can be used for benchmark studies of normalized weather conditions.
81

6.5 Conclusion
      Project plan was finished to locate various types of sensors on the system. Sensors were calibrated, installed and connected to the DAQ system. LabVIEW code was developed to collect data, process and store. Equations used to calculate high level information were implemented in the code. Relational database was adopted in the SQL server to store data. Data acquisition and post-analysis are on-going.

Preliminary analysis shows that the indoor-outdoor temperature difference is the primary factor, influencing the ERV performance, in-floor radiant heating and total electricity demand. The sensible and latent heat recovery of the ERV increases with the increase of indoor-outdoor temperature difference and specific humidity difference, respectively. In the in-floor radiant heating system, a higher heating demand was observed on the 3rd floor. Indoor temperature was maintained constant at 21C in the winter, regardless of the indoor-outdoor temperature difference. The space heating demand and the total electricity consumption increases linearly with the increase of indoor-outdoor temperature difference. One year of data in the 4.08 kW photovoltaic (PV) systems has been collected. The measured one year output is 16.30% less than the RETScreen analysis, excluding the consideration of other losses. Nevertheless, the yearly measured data is 7.30% less than the prediction based on the rule of thumb of Toronto's solar resources. The average thermal and electrical efficiency of the Whispergen micro combined heat and power (CHP) unit achieved 80% and 7%, respectively. The average overall efficiency achieved 87% (based on a higher heating value of natural gas). The average instantaneous efficiency of the evacuated tube solar collector achieved 74% when solar irradiance is more than 800 W/m2. First phase of the project, i.e., the infrastructure of quality data collection is completed. The collected data is analysed, which are consistent with the manufacturer manual and different publications.

82

6.6 Recommendations
Following recommendations are made to get good quality data from the monitoring system:   It is important to make a schedule for calibrate the sensors regularly. It is essential to check the monitoring program every day by remote log-in to ensure that it is running, and by the same way, checking the "Measurement & Automation" window of LabVIEW software every day to ensure that all sensors are working.  It should check SQL database regularly to ensure that data is saving properly, and backup the database as well. If there is inconsistent reading found in the database of any sensor, troubleshoot immediately. Hence, regular data analysis is essential to avoid long time insignificant data collection.   It should be important to make a schedule for preventive maintenance of all mechanical equipment according to manufacturer guideline. From time to time, it is important to physically check the duct, hydronic line and equipment for any leakage.

Appendix B: Experimental Uncertainty Analysis
The uncertainty analysis is performed on the mechanical system/equipment that are analysed in the Chapter 5.

B1 Uncertainty of Sensors and Calibrators: Two error sources are considered in the
uncertainty analysis. One is the accuracy value of sensors (Table B.1) and the other is the accuracy value of calibrators (Table B.2). Random error is neglected in this analysis. Square Root Sum of Squares (SRSS) method is followed which means that combine all errors or accuracy by squaring them, adding the squares together and taking the square root of the sum of those squares (ASHRAE Guideline 2, 2005). Overall accuracy of sensors = Where Ac = Calibrator accuracy, and As = Sensor accuracy Overall accuracy of sensors from Equation (B.1) is used in the propagation of errors calculation to determine the accuracy of mechanical system/equipment.

B2 Propagation of Errors: It is simple arithmetic calculations with numbers containing
uncertainties. Any value cannot measure accurately. A true value can be expressed by its mean and standard deviation, such as XÂ±x, where X is the average and x is the standard deviation of the set of x-measurements. When expressed in this way, x is referred to as the absolute error in the variable x. However, the number and its error can be written as X(1Â±x/X). The ratio within the parentheses, x/X, is called the relative error in the measurement x. This ratio is often multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percent. Thus the number 56 Â±0.6 cm can be also expressed as 56 cm Â± 1.07%. Table B.3 shows the calculation of errors for numerous basic mathematical operations with numbers containing uncertainties (Biological Science Institute, 2002).
