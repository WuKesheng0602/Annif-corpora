ABSTRACT

ROBUST NONLINEAR CONTROL OF UNDERACTUATED SATELLITE FORMATION Geoffrey Robert Me Vittie, Master of Applied Science, Electrical Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, 2008

In this thesis, the control of the underactuated satellite formation system is exarruned. The underactuated satellite formation consists of a leader-follower configuration where there is no control force available in the radial direction relative to the orbit of the leader satellite. Two new relay sliding mode controllers are proposed as a method of controlling the formation system. The first controller is developed using the Hill's equation of motion of the satellite formation and the sliding manifold is designed based on linear quadratic regulation and the algebraic Riccati equation. The second controller uses a
2nd

order state dependent

time varying approximation of the satellite formation and the sliding manifold is chosen in real-time through the evaluation of the causal approximation of the differential Riccati equation. The incorporation of the nonlinearity and time varying properties of the system into the control law expands the operational range of application. The theoretical stability bounds of the two control laws are deterrruned guaranteeing the robust nature of the closed loop system against both matched and unmatched disturbances. A series of numerical simulations are used to validate the stability and robustness of the proposed control laws. Finally, some simulations are provided to deterrrune the effect of controller and system parameters on the control laws' performance.

Introduction

In recent years, the satellite and space community has seen an increase in technological development brought about by the development of large scale launch systems, such as the European Space Agency' s (ESA) Ariane-5 or NASA's cargo launch vehicle Ares-V, combined with the availability of inexpensive high-powered computing systems and sensor technology. This has resulted in the renewed interest of many missions and satellite applications that were once deemed either too expensive or high risk for serious investment. One such application is satellite formation flying. A satellite formation consists of a group of satellites that operate together to accomplish a task that would either be too costly or impossible for a single satellite. In spite of the relatively low cost of formation deployment, it is always a primary goal in any satellite mission design to extend the operational lifespan of the mission. The control of the formation obviously becomes a key aspect in achieving the successful completion of the mission. Ideally, a satellite formation system can be controlled with high-precision using full and precise thrust available in all directions. However, in reality the satellite formation is subjected to disturbances and perturbations that need to be counteracted by the controllers. Furthermore, satellite hardware can be vulnerable to failure. When these failures occur, the control laws developed for the ideal system are no longer valid. This thesis undertakes the challenge of developing a robust controller that will stabilize a satellite formation using a reduced number of thrusters and provide guaranteed operation in the presence of perturbing forces.

1

1. 1 Motivation
The funding required for space mission is extremely high; with many companies and institutions only able to meet the financial requirements necessary for a single mission. As a result, the cost of failure can be devastating, both scientifically and financially. From 1990 to 2001, a total of 29% of all satellite failures, either partial or total, were attributed to the Guidance, Navigation and Control system (GN&C). Furthermore, 37% of the problems with the GN&C have resulted in a total loss of the mission [I] . In the case of satellite formations, if the formation consists of two satellites, the loss of either satellite would mean the loss of the entire mission. If the formation consists of more than two satellites, the mission may be able to tolerate the initial loss of one satellite in the formation and then it would be operating in reduced capacity and loss of vital scientific and experimental data. The critical question to be answered here is, 'In the event of a failure, can the formation and

the mission be salvaged?' Since the satellite formation is already in orbit, any method that
could be employed to extend the lifespan, especially following a failure, is beneficial. The failure that a satellite formation would be particularly prone to is the loss of thruster control, which is necessary to maintain the formation geometry. Therefore, the primary goal is the development of control methodologies capable of recovering the formation in a post-failure, reduced control state, specifically when the formation system is underactuated. Even the new control methods developed would still be subject to the realities of the original formation system, including constraints on available thrust and fuel; and, disturbances and perturbations acting on the satellites. Thus, determining the limits to which the new control technology would work is also a necessary aspect of the design.

1.2 Literature Review
The literature review is given in two parts. First, the research on the general area of satellite formation control with particular emphasis on the control methodologies is presented. Second, the specific area of underactuated satellite formation and the current control methodologies that have been explored in this area is outlined.

1.2.1 Satellite Formations
The development of satellite formation flying missions has become an active area of study in both theory and practice [2 - 14]. A variety of interesting scientific applications exist that require the use satellite formations. The two most notable applications are outlined here, including some of the missions in which they were employed. The first application for satellite formations is the distribution of sensor hardware over several satellites, reducing the power and mass costs on each individual satellite as well as the probability of a total mission failure. An example of this application is shown in Figure 1.1 where the formation consists of the Earth Observing 1 (E0-1) satellite in conjunction with LandSat 7. The satellites are able to simultaneously scan the same location of the Earth's surface with a variety of sensory equipment and gather high-fidelity climate information that would be too costly to acquire using a single satellite [2- 4]. A second application of satellite formations is to achieve large separation distances between sensor modules, otherwise known as sparse aperture. In the case of imaging missions, the multiple low resolution sensors with large separation distances equivalent to a single, high-resolution sensor with large aperture. An illustration of this application is seen with TechSat 21 [5-6]. Each satellite in the formation is equipped with RADAR technology. Although the sensitivity of each satellite may be very small, the formation, as a whole, acts like a single large radio antenna. The TechSat 21 formation is shown in Figure 1.2. Another example of a formation employing large separation distances for measurement purposes is the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) satellite mission where the formation of satellites is used to measure variations in the gravitational field [7]. In order to fulfill mission requirements, high-precision control of the satellite formation becomes crucial. As a result, several research initiatives have been directed toward controller design [ 15 - 28]. Linear control methodologies, including linear quadratic regulation (LQR), have been proven to be effective at stabilizing satellite formations [15 - 17]. Nonlinear control methodologies have also been proposed to stabilize the satellite formation systems, including feedback linearization [18], several forms of adaptive learning control [19 - 20], model predictive control [21], and sliding mode control [22 - 26]. Of these control methodologies, sliding mode control is particularly useful for the control of satellites due to the impulsive, or bang-bang, style of the controller output which is necessary due to the

3

physical operation of a typical thruster. An interesting design of the sliding mode control is proposed by Yeh et al. [26], where the basic sliding mode controller is enhanced though the addition of a dead zone, or boundary layer, around the sliding mode. This controller, also known as relay sliding mode control, is then able to stabilize the satellite formation while reducing the fuel consumption.

1.2.2 Underactuated Satellite Formations
The special case of the underactuated satellite formation occurs when control force is not available along one axis, specifically the radial axis due as a result of controllability issues. There are several possible reasons for control thrust not being available in the radial direction. First, researchers have proposed that the satellites are designed with only one thruster in order to minimize complexity and mass [29 - 32]. A second reason is control achieved through the use of differential aerodynamic drag forces. Differential drag has the obvious advantage of not requiring any fuel but the control is only available in the tangential direction [33- 34]. Finally, the thrusters can be physically disabled, due either to mechanical or electrical failure. Kumar et al. [29] have shown that proportional control can be applied to stabilize the underactuated LEO formation system. The proportional control was based on an ideal linear model and only marginally stable, which resulted in large tracking errors dependent on the initial conditions. The more advanced LQR was applied to the underactuated formation system and compared to the performance of the fully actuated system [30 - 32]. Although the LQR was able to stabilize the system, the requirement for variable thrust and the unconstrained control output makes it difficult to implement into a real satellite formation system. Furthermore, the LQR controller was developed from the linearized equations of motion and no considerations were given to disturbing forces acting on the system. Leonard et al. [33] applied a nonlinear, bang-bang controller to the system using linear phase-plane analysis. The phase-plane control is effective in its ability to restrict the control thrust and still drive the system to equilibrium. The only significant drawback of the phase-plane control law is the necessity to engage in maneuvers with large overshoot to bring the system to equilibrium. As with the proportional controller and LQR, the phase plane controller is developed from the linearized system model and there were no explicit consideration of disturbance forces acting on the formation.

1.3 Scope of Thesis
Based on the research that has already been conducted in the area of underactuated satellite control, the scope of the current research was established. In the current study, it is assumed that the attitude of the spacecraft in the formation is independently maintained. The disturbance forces acting on the spacecraft are restricted to the differential perturbations.

5

1.4 Research Objectives
The primary research objectives of this thesis are given as follows:
(1) Control of an underactuated satellite formation system, specifically without control

actuation in the radial direction. (2) A robust nonlinear control algorithm for underactuated satellite formation flying, developed from the linearized system model. (3) A robust nonlinear control algorithm for underactuated satellite formation flying, developed from a time-varying
2nd

order approximation of the system model. The

2nd

order approximation is employed to expand the operational range of the linear controller. (4) Precise formation keeping in the presence of model imperfections, external disturbances, and initial formation errors. This consideration is critical as these factors are responsible for the degradation and dispersal of the formation geometry.

1.5 Contributions of Thesis
The thesis makes several contributions and advancements in the area of underactuated satellite formation flying control. The key contributions are as follows:
(1) The application of closed-loop, nonlinear control for underactuated satellite formation

flying, where all previous techniques have either been linear or open-loop. (2) Proof of the stability and robustness of the linear time invariant sliding mode controller. The robustness is proven against matched and unmatched disturbance forces acting on the system. The robustness improves the reliability and feasibility in applying the control method to an actual system. (3) Proof of the stability and robustness of the time-variant, state-dependent sliding mode controller against both matched and unmatched disturbing forces acting on the formation.

6

1.6 Thesis Organization
This thesis is organized as follows:

In Chapter 2 the nonlinear equations of motion for the underactuated satellite are derived through the Euler-Lagrange method. The nonlinear equations are simplified by first transforming them into a
2nd

order approximation and then into the classical Hill's equations,

representing the linear, time-invariant (LTI) approximation. Next, the projected circular formation is presented as a stable configuration derived from the analytical solution of Hill's equations. Following the development of the system model and desired trajectory, the disturbing forces acting on the system are described. The dominant forces are due to the oblateness of the Earth, aerodynamic drag, and thruster imperfections. Finally, the chapter concludes with a description of the performance criteria used to evaluate the performance of the control laws to be developed in the proceeding chapter.

Chapter 3 begins with a brief review of variable structure control (VSC) and sliding mode control (SMC). This is followed by a description of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method and the state-dependent, time-variant quadratic regulator. The next section presents the design of the robust linear time invariant sliding mode controller. The controller is then redeveloped as the robust, state-dependent, time-varying sliding mode controller. In the design of both controllers, stability is ensured against both matched and unmatched disturbances acting on the system. The SMC laws are then modified into the relay control, with new boundaries established for the robustness of the system. Concluding remarks are then made concerning the issue of robustness and performance between the LTI and statedependent, time-variant controllers.

Chapter 4 presents the numerical simulations used to validate the control laws designed Chapter 3 on the underactuated satellite formation system presented in Chapter 2. First, a detailed description of the simulation methodology and modeling is provided. Then a set of tests is made to verify the expected behavior of the control. This is followed by a series of simulations used to test the performance of the control laws under a variety of conditions that

7

would be typical of a satellite formation mission. These conditions include variations in disturbance forces and eccentricity of the leader satellite's orbit. A detailed analysis of the results of the simulations is performed with particular emphasis placed upon the fuel consumption and tracking performance. Chapter 4 ends with a discussion on the advantages and limitations of the proposed controllers.

Chapter 5 concludes the thesis with some remarks concerning the control laws developed for the underactuated formation system and possible directions on future work.

Chapter 2
Underactuated Satellite Formation
In this Chapter, the concept and model of a satellite formation flying system is developed. Section 2.1 develops the equations of motion of the satellite formation system through the Euler-Lagrange method. The nonlinear dynamics model is linearized about the equilibrium manifold and a framework for controllability is presented in Section 2.2. In Section 2.3, the analytical solution of the linear equations of motion and the resulting formation configurations are presented. Section 2.4 presents a general overview of the perturbing and disturbing forces acting on the satellite formation. Finally, Section 2.5 outlines the performance criteria to be used to evaluate the controllers in numerical simulation.

2. 1 Model Formulation
A schematic of the satellite formation is shown in Figure 2.1, where
~

and

r

are

respectively the position vectors of the leader and follower satellites relative to the Earth;

p = [X

y

Z

r

is the relative position vector between the leader and follower satellite; fJ is

the angular position of the leader satellite in the orbital plane; and finally, x, y, and z define the radial, tangential, and normal (RTN) coordinate frame of the follower satellite relative to the leader satellite, respectively [35]. Relative motion of a single follower satellite with respect to a leader satellite is considered in this study. A few assumptions concerning the formulation of the model will be established. The leader and follower satellites are treated as point masses in a geocentric inertial reference frame. A spherical Earth is assumed. Finally, it is assumed that no perturbations or control are acting on the leader satellite's orbit. As a result the behavior is defined by initial conditions.

9

Under these assumptions, the leader satellite's equations of motion are given as:

(2-1) (2-2)

where rc is the radius of the leader satellite's orbit, (} is and true anomaly of the leader satellite's orbit, and f.le is the gravitational parameter of the Earth. From these assumptions, it is now possible to develop the relative equations of motion of the follower satellite.

2.1.1 Energy of the System
In order to apply the Euler-Langrage equation it is first necessary to derive the potential and kinetic energy of the system. The potential energy of the follower satellite is given as:

1 ( r·r . .) T =-m 2

(2-4)

Since the goal is to find the relative equations of motion, Eq. (2-4) is transformed into the orbital coordinate frame as follows:

2.1.2 Euler-Lagrange Equations of Motion
The Euler-Lagrange function of a system is defined as follows:
L=T-V
(2-6)

where T and V are the kinetic and potential energies defined earlier. The equations of motion are then derived using the following equations:

(2-7)

Where q = [x

where Dx,y,z represents the perturbing forces acting along each axis and Ux,y,z is the control forces applied along the tangential and normal axes, respectively. The underactuated nature of the formation system is achieved by removing control actuation in the radial direction, i.e.

Ux = 0. Equations (2-20), (2-21), and (2-22) can be simplified by normalizing the equations
with respect to the mass of the follower satellite, m. The resulting equations are given as follows:

2.2 Model Approximations
In order to develop control laws, the nonlinear equations of motion, given by Eqs. (2-23), (2-24) and (2-25), are simplified. Two approximations of Eqs. (2-23), (2-24) and (2-25) are derived. The first approximation is a
2nd

order state dependent time varying model. The

second approximation is a linear time invariant model.

2.2.1 Second Order, Time-Varying Approximation
The most significant nonlinearity in the equations of motion (2-23), (2-24), and (2-25) is the radial norm of the follower satellite, r. Therefore, the function for r is substituted into (2-23), (2-24), and (2-25) and are rewritten in the following form:

Although a variety of methods to linearize a system, the binomial series expansion is chosen due to the simplicity of its application. The binomial series is given as follows:

(2-29)

Using the assumption that the relative distance between the two satellites is much smaller than the orbital radius, i.e. x, y, z << rc, the terms inside the square brackets can then be replaced with the two first terms of the binomial expansion as follows:

(2-30)

(2-31)

14

(2-32)

Expanding (2-30), (2-31) , and (2-32), and neglecting the third and higher order terms, the 2nd order approximation of the equations of motion is expressed as:

y = ( 3 ~f -8 Jx+( 8' -

2.2.2 Hill's Equations

The 2nd order system approximation can be simplified into a linear, time-invariant model. If it is assumed that the leader satellite is in a circular orbit, then the angular acceleration is reduced to zero,

--

iJ = 0 ,

and the angular velocity becomes a constant,

iJ = n = ~11/ t;;3

·

Substituting these new relations and neglecting the 2nd order terms, Eqs. (2-33), (2-34), and

(2-35) are reduced to the following:
.X = 3n x + 2ny + d x

(2-37) (2-38)

Equations (2-37), (2-38), and (2-39) are commonly referred to as either the Hill's or Clohessey-Wiltshire equations [36- 37]. The Hill's equations can also be represented in the state space form as:

A comparison of the uncontrolled, unperturbed tracking errors between the nonlinear model, and the 2nd order and LTI approximations are presented in Figure 2.2. The desired formation and tracking reference are defined in Section 2.3. The nonlinear model and the 2nd order approximation experience time varying tracking error in the radial and normal directions combined with a constant drift in the tangential direction. Furthermore, this illustrates the limits of linear time invariant approximation.

2.2.3 Controllability
After developing the model approximations in the previous section, it is necessary now to ensure that the approximations of the underactuated satellite formation system are controllable. A linear, time-invariant (LTI) system is defined to be controllable if the rank of the controllability matrix:
(2-41)

is equal to the number of system states [38]. For the Hill's equations, it is easily verified that the rank of the controllability matrix is equivalent to the number of states, specifically six. The concept of controllability can easily be extended to time-varying, state-dependent systems [39]. The generalized controllability test is defined as:

16

rank [ B ( x, t)

A ( x, t) B ( x, t)

A 2 ( x, t) B ( x, t)

An-I (

x, t) B (X, t) = n Vx, t

J

(2-42)

where n is the number of system states. In this formulation, the controllability of the system is defined for all points of x and over the entire time range. It is important to note that, unlike the LTI definition, controllability may only occur locally over a defined region of states. The
2nd

order approximation of the underactuated satellite formation system can be

verified as controllable in a realistic operational region surrounding the leader satellite, or reference point.

2.2.4 Normalization
In order to simplify the design and tuning of control laws for the satellite formation system, the equations of motion are normalized by the orbital frequency [25]. A new time base is defined as follows:

r=nt
where n = ~Jle/ a
3

(2-43)

is the mean orbital frequency. Using the new time base, the system states

can be expressed as follows:

2.2.5 Integral Augmentation
One of the major concerns in the development of any control system is achieving steady-state tracking around the equilibrium point; in particular, the elimination of any constant steadystate error. In order to address this concern, the system state vector and matrix can be augmented with additional integral states. In the case of the underactuated satellite formation system, t o new integral states can be introduced. The new states are expressed as follows:

The 2nd order approximation of the system equations can similarly be augmented with integrator states. It should be noted that due to the underactuated configuration of the system,

19

specifically the absence of control actuation along the radial axis, the integration of the radial position error cannot be achieved as this would render the system uncontrollable, according to the definition given in Section 2.2.3. However, as the critical separation distance of the formation is on the y and z axes, a constant steady-state error on the x-axis can be tolerated.

2.3 Minimum Energy Configurations
One of the primary concerns with any satellite mission is the reduction of fuel consumption. Although there are an infinite number of possible satellite formation configurations, the configurations are typically chosen to minimize the fuel requirements of the controller. These formations are known as minimum energy configurations. The minimum energy configurations are derived from the analytical solution of Hill's equations [40]. As a result, the controller to be implemented is only required to counteract the unmodelled system nonlinearity and the external disturbance forces.

2.3.1 Analytical Solution of Hill's Equations
The analytical solutions of the Hill's equations are derived using the frequency domain method [41]. Assuming no disturbances or control forces are acting on the system, the state space representation of the system (2-40) can be expressed in the simplified notation given as:

x=Ax

(2-50)

where x is the state vector and :X is the time derivative of the state vector. Taking the Laplace transform on both sides of (2-50) as follows:

sX (s) -

x ( 0) = AX ( s)

(2-51)

where x ( 0) is the state vector at time t = 0. Rearranging expression (2-51) as:

X ( s) = [ sl- A

rl

X ( 0)

(2-52)

Applying the inverse Laplace transform to both sides of (2-52) yields:

20

x(t) = .1: 1 {[ sl- A =<I>(t)x(O)
where

r x(O)
1 }

(2-53)

<I> (t)

is the state transition matrix. For the satellite formation system, the state

transition matrix is given as:

A number of interesting formation configurations can now be developed from (2-52). The most significant configurations include the in-plane, in-track, circular, and projected circular formations [40]. For brevity, only the projected circular formation will be considered in this thesis; however, the work can easily extended to the other formation configurations.

2.3.2 Projected Circular Formation
In the projected circular formation, the leader and follower satellites maintain a fixed separation distance in the yz -plane. In the 3-dimensional environment, the formation actually consists of the follower satellite traveling in an elliptical path around the leader satellite. Therefore, the desired formation is dictated by the following constraint:
(2-55)

where the subscript d represents the desired trajectory and rd is the desired radius of the projected circle. As seen in (2-54), some terms are linearly proportional to time, t. In order to counteract the secular growth caused by these terms, the following constraints are applied to the initial conditions:

21

(2-56)

Substituting (2-55) and (2-56) into (2-54) and after some algebraic manipulation, the equations for the desired motion of the projected formation are given as follows:

xd {t) = rd sin {nt + ¢)
2

Yd { t) = rd cos {nt + ¢)

zd ( t) = rd sin {nt + ¢)
(2-57)

xd ( t) = rd n cos ( nt + ¢)
2

yd {t) = -rdn sin {nt + ¢) id {t) = rd n cos {nt + ¢)
where ¢ is the phase of formation relative to the orbit of the leader satellite. A schematic of the projected circular formation is shown in Figure 2.3. The projected circular formation mission has a particular advantage for sparse aperture missions, where the projected distance between the satellites is required to be fixed. With the desired trajectory of the projected satellite formation, it is now possible to derive the error states of the system. The error states are given as:

y = y- yd z = z- zd

- . . x=x-xd - . . y = y- yd

(2-58)

z= i-id

Since the desired trajectory is derived from the analytical solution of the Hill equations (2-40), they are also the equations for the error states.

2.4 Perturbations and Disturbances
The Hill equations (2-40) describe the ideal behavior of the satellite formation . However, in reality there are many environmental factors affecting the orbital path of the satellites. The following subsections describe the dominant forces affecting the satellite formation.

2.4.1 J2 Gravitational Effect
The most significant perturbing force acting on a satellite, while in low Earth orbit, is the variations in gravitational force of Earth. Of these variations, the second degree zonal

23

spherical harmonic, J 2

= 1082 X 1o-6 '

produces the primary disturbing force due to the Earth

oblateness [42]. The motion of the leader satellite a satellite in the inertial frame, see Figure 2.1, is described by the following equations:

(2-59)

where ~

= [Xc

~

Zc] is the geocentric position vector of the satellite and r is the

corresponding acceleration. The equations of motion of a satellite with the 12 disturbing are expressed in the inertial frame as:

(2-60)

where r and rc are the orbital radii of the leader and follower satellites and Re is the radius of the Earth. The position of the follower satellite in the inertial frame, defined by

r = [X

Y

Z], is determined from the position of the leader satellite and the relative

position between the leader and follower satellites. The conversion is expressed as follows:

(2-61)

where m is the argument of periapsis, .Q is longitude of the ascending node, and i the inclination. By applying three rotations, the relative disturbance between the leader and follower satellites is expressed in the orbital frame of the leader satellite. The rotations sequence is given as follows:

24

(2-62)

Since it is required to using numerical propagation to calculate the differential 12 force, it will be strictly treated as a bounded disturbance Dx,y,z

=[ dx

dY dz acting on the Eq. (2-26),

J

(2-27), and (2-28) for the purposes of developing a control law.

2.4.2 Aerodynamic Drag
In LEO, the density of the Earth's atmosphere is sufficient to create a noticeable drag force on the spacecraft. The drag force, which is a function of the speed of the spacecraft, projected surface area, and density of the atmosphere, is typically modeled as a free molecular impact. As a result, the force on the spacecraft is continuous and in the direction opposite of travel. The drag force can also be radically varied by the effects of solar activity on the Earth' s atmosphere. Although the drag force acting on each satellite in the formation can be very large, the relative drag force between them is much less. Kumar et al. [34] has determined the typical drift values caused by differential drag for a pair of 8 kg nano-satellites, with a 10% difference in projected surface area over a range of solar activity. The results of the study are given in Table 2.1.
Table 2.1: Drift due to differential aerodynamic drag [26]

Tangential Drift/day Radial Drift/day

Low Solar Activity 15 m 0.15 m

Normal Solar Activity 110 m 1.2m

High Solar Activity 460 m 4.5m

2.4.3 Thrusters
The third greatest contribution of perturbations to the satellite formation is the physical imperfections of the thrusters. There are two sources for deviations in thruster performance. The first is thruster alignment on the spacecraft or error in the spacecraft's attitude. The result is components of the control thrust along axes other than those desired, thus creating a

25

disturbing force. The second deviation is in the thruster output, which can be caused by variation in the fuel pressure or physical degradation of the thruster hardware.

2.5 Performance Criteria
In order to evaluate and tune the controller to be presented in the following chapter, it is necessary to establish a set of performance criteria. With any space mission, the two key requirements on the success of the mission are stabilizing the spacecraft to within a desired trajectory and on minimizing the magnitude and consumption of fuel, which is typically limited by the size and mass of the spacecraft. These criteria are presented in detail in the following subsections.

2.5.1 Projected Formation Error
The projected formation error is the distance between the satellite and desired path in the

yz- plane. The projected formation error is given by the formula:

~y,z ( t) = ~ y2 ( t) + z2 ( t)

(2-63)

Since the projected error is critical for the success of any imaging or interferometer experiments, it serves as a quality performance measure for the control system. The proposed NASA mission for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite formations suggested a projected separation distance error of no more than 5 meters [9] . Therefore, this will be the primary practical performance requirement, beyond stability, for the control system.

2.5.2 Fuel Consumption, 11 V
The fuel consumption of a spacecraft is typically measured in units of L\ V which is the summation of the changes of acceleration of the spacecraft over the period of an orbit. The formula for L\ V is given as follows:
L\V
-.=
P
0

orbit

J~u ~ ('r)+u~ (r)dr
·

(2-64)

where

P is the period of the leader satellite's orbit and uy,z are the mass normalized control

forces. It is obvious that on any spacecraft, the length of a mission is determined by the
26

amount of fuel available. Therefore, after the critical requirement of maintain the projected formation error within bounds is met, the task is the reduction in the L1 V consumption.

2.5.3 In-Plane Formation Error
The third performance measure is the in-plane formation error. This is the error in distance from the desired trajectory in the orbital plane of the leader satellite, which is expressed as :

(2-65)

Although the in-plane error will not have a significant impact on the overall success of a formation mission, it does provide a useful check on the radial position and stability of the system.

Chapter 3
Robust Sliding Mode Control

In this chapter, the development of the robust sliding mode controller (SMC) is presented. First a brief introduction to variable structure control (VSC) and SMC is provided. This is followed by a review of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and state-dependent, time variant quadratic regulation. The robust linear, time-invariant SMC is then presented. This is followed by the robust state-dependent, time-varying SMC. Finally, the conventional switching control law is modified into the relay controller and the robustness bounds are redefined. The chapter concludes with some remarks on the tuning parameters of the controllers.

3. 1 Review of Variable Structure Control
Variable structure control (VSC) is a powerful nonlinear control technique. The VSC, as its name suggests, achieves the desired response by switching control values in order to vary the dynamic structure of the system. Although individually each dynamic structure may be unstable, a stable response can be achieved by switching between the structures. Figure 3.1 shows the construction of a variable structure system. It is evident that although both subsystems are unstable, when combined the system will converge towards the equilibrium point at zero. Referring to Figure 3.1, it is evident the VSC can be developed for
2nd

systems. However, for

larger systems the design becomes more complicated; this resulted in the development of the sliding mode controller (SMC). The SMC is based on selecting a switching function, a, that is composed of the system's state variables. When the switching function reaches zero,
a = 0 , also known as the sliding manifold or surface, the system takes on the constrained

behavior of the manifold. While the system state trajectory is on the sliding manifold, it is

29

known as the sliding mode. The sliding manifold is typically chosen to force the system states to converge to the desired reference states. Finally, when the system states have converged to zero on the sliding manifold, the system has achieved equilibrium. Figure 3.2 shows a representation of a typical SMC and the key components of the trajectory.

Although the SMC is a powerful controller, it does suffer from the problem known as chattering. Chattering is the high frequency switching of the controller when the system has reached the sliding manifold. A variety of techniques have been suggested to counteract the chattering effect, including the use of the sigmoid, or saturation functions [44]. For the case of spacecraft system, where control thrust is limited to fixed impulsive values, the relay controller, which incorporates a dead zone around the sliding manifold, is employed. Further detail of the relay controller is provided in Section 3.5. Before the development of the sliding mode controllers, a review of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is presented. The LQR

30

methodology will later be applied to the design of the sliding manifold due to its ability to guarantee the stability of both linear time-invariant (LTI) and state-dependent, time-varying (SDTV) control laws.

3.2 Linear Quadratic Regulator
Consider the generic system represented in the following form:

x=Ax+Bu

(3-1)

where x{t)E IR.n is the state vector; AE IR.nxn is the state matrix; BE IR.nxm is the control matrix; and, u E IR.m is the control input vector. In order to evaluate the performance of a linear control law, a quadratic performance metric for the system is proposed as follows:
If

]=

J[ XT (-r)Qx(-r)+uT (-r)Ru{-r)]d-r

(3-2)

where Q E IR.nxn and R E IR.mxm are the state and control weighting matrices, respectively; and

tE IR.+and t1 E IR.+ are the current and final times of the evaluation, respectively. A linear
control law for the system (3-1) is proposed as follows: 31

u =-BrPx

(3-3)

where P E

JR.nxn

is a positive semi-definite, symmetric matrix. The choice of P that

minimizes the cost function (3-2) is determined by the solution of the differential Riccati equation (DRE). The DRE is expressed as follows:
(3-4)

where P E

JR.nxn

is a positive definite, symmetric matrix [38, 46- 47]. Two particular cases

exist for the solution of the DRE. These are presented in the following two subsections.

3.2.1 Linear, Time-Invariant
If the system (3-1) is linear time invariant (LTI), then the pair metric (3-2) is then evaluated from
t0 =

(A, B) are constant. The cost

0 to

tf = oo and

the solution, P, will be constant. As

a result, the DRE (3-4) satisfying the modified cost metric can be reduced to the well known algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) given as:
(3-5)

The standard numerical solution to the ARE is found using the method presented by Zak [38].

3.2.2 State Dependent, Time-Variant
In the case of the state dependent, time-variant (SDTV) system (3-1 ), the matrix pair {A, B) is no longer constant. Therefore, the optimal control solution of the cost metric (3-2) is found by solving the differential Riccati equation (DRE). However, the solution of the DRE requires the system's states over the time span
t ~

r

~ tf.

Since the solution uses future state

values, it can be considered non-causal and not realizable in practice. In order to resolve this problem, it has been suggested that the forward integration be changed to a backward integration [46, 47]. The time span of integration is then defined as
t0
~

r ~ t. The modified differential Riccati equation is then expressed as:

32

(3-6)

where P' is a positive-definite, symmetric matrix. Although P' is a causal solution of the DRE, and realizable in practice, it is important to note that it only represents a realizable solution, not the optimal solution.

3.3 Robust Linear Time Invariant Sliding Mode Control
The design and proof of robustness for the linear time invariant sliding mode controller given is expansion on the method given by Hui et al. [48]. Specifically, the pole placement technique has been superseded with the application of linear quadratic regulation. Consider the linear time invariant (LTI) system expressed in the following form:

x=Ax+Bu+d
where x E

BE ~nxm

is the disturbance vector. The state vector can

be decomposed into two state vectors, x = [xi

where xi E ~n-m, x 2 E ~m . The system

(3-7) can now be expressed in the more specific form:

Assumption 1: The pair

(A, B)

is controllable for all

Assumption 2: The matched and unmatched disturbances, di and

(3-9)

A, a 21 , a 22 , y, /32

are nonnegative constants and JHJ represents

the Euclidean norm of a vector or matrix.

Corollary 1: Since the pair {A, B) is controllable for all x E ~n, then the subsystem defined by the pair {A 11 , A 12 ) is also controllable for all x E ~ n · From this framework, the robust LTI sliding mode controller is next developed.

3.3.1 Switching Function
The switching function is defined as follows:
(3-10)

where PE ~(n-m)x(n-m) is a positive definite, symmetric matrix that is to be determined. The objective here is to select a set of Lyapunov functions for the switching function, CY, and unmatched states, x 1 , to prove the stability of the controlled system. Therefore, the system disturbances are redefined in terms of CY and x 1 · Rearranging the switching function, Eq. (3-1 0) is given as:
(3-11)

The norm of (3-11) can be expressed:
(3-12)

Substituting (3-12) into (3-9), the disturbance norms are written as:

JJd~JI ~ (all + ai211A~2PII) Jlx~JI + a12li(YII +A
JJd2JJ ~ ( a21 + a2211A~2PII) JJx~JJ + a22JJCYJJ + rJJuJJ + fJ2

(3-14)

A candidate Lyapunov function for the unmatched states, x 1 , is considered as:
(3-15)

where PE

IR(n-m)x(n-m)

is the positive definite, symmetric matrix mentioned earlier. Taking results in the following:

The Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) described earlier is restated here as:
(3-18)

where Q E

IR(n-m)x(n-m)

is a positive definite symmetric matrix. In order to reduce the

complexity of the design, the R matrix defined in Eq. (3-2) has been assumed to be the identity matrix. Substituting the ARE into the Lyapunov derivative and rearranging the terms results in the following expression:

A~2 P is a positive definite symmetric matrix. Applying a where Q + 2PA 12 A~2 P- PA 12 R- 1

the derivative of the second Lyapunov function (3-33) is expressed as:

This completes the derivation of the Lyapunov function of the switching function and it derivative.

3.3.3 Stability Bounds
The region of stability for the controlled system is determined by the region satisfying the Lyapunov theorem for local stability. This theorem is stated as follows:

Theorem 1: If, in a ball B , there exists a scalar function V {x) with
continuous first partial derivatives such that
· V ( x) is positive definite (locally in B)

· V (x)

is negative semi-definite (locally in B)

then the equilibrium point 0 is stable. If, actually, the derivative locally negative definite in B, then the stability is asymptotic [43].

V {x)

is

The two Lyapunov functions (3-15) and (3-25) satisfy the first requirement of Theorem 1. The derivative of the first Lyapunov function is given as follows:
(3-36)

Since the norm of the unmatched states, llx1 11, is always positive, the derivative of the Lyapunov function (3-36) will be negative, semi-definite, given the following condition:
(3-37)

The derivative of the second Lyapunov function is given by the following
(3-38)

In order to satisfy the second requirement of Theorem 1, the following condition can be applied to (3-38):
(3-39)

39

The first boundary on the stability is determined by substituting (3-37) into (3-39) as follows:

(3-40)

Therefore, the outer boundary on the region of stability is defined as:

(3-41)

With the outer boundary of the region of stability defined, the inner boundary can now be developed. Upon reaching the sliding manifold,
0'

=0,

the derivative of the first Lyapunov

function (3-36), can be simplified to the following relationship:
(3-42)

The lower boundary on the region of stability is defined as the boundary of the interior region of instability. Specifically, the boundary layer occurs when

v; > 0; this implies:
(3-43)

The inner boundary of the stability region is defined as:

(3-44)

Therefore, any trajectory starting inside the region defined by .E in Eq. (3-41) will asymptotically converge to the region

r

and remain there for all future time. This behavior

is guaranteed by Theorem 1, thus proving the stability and robustness of the system.

40

3.4 Robust State Dependent Time Varying Sliding Mode Control
In order to further improve the tracking performance of the controller, the more generalized robust, state dependent, time varying (SDTV) sliding mode controller is derived from the LTI SMC law developed in the previous section. The system model is defined as follows:

X( t) = A (X, t) x ( t) + B (X, t) u ( t) + d ( x, t)
where x(t)E
IRn

(3-45)

is the state vector; A{x,t)E

IRnxn

is the state matrix; B(x,t)E

IRnxm

is the

control matrix; u ( x, t) E IRm is the control input vector; and, d ( x,t) E IRn is the disturbance vector. For the derivation presented here, the system is assumed to be in the more specific form:

matrices; IE

unmatched disturbances, respectively. For simplification, the ( x, t) notation representing the state and time dependence is removed. The following assumptions concerning the system are made:

Assumption 1: The pair {A, B) is controllable for all XE

IRn

and tE IR+.

Assumption 2: The matched and unmatched disturbances, d 1 and

d 2 are

bounded as:

Corollary 1: Since the pair (A, B) is controllable for all

1R n and t E 1R +'

then the sub-system defined by the pair ( A 11 , A 12 ) is also controllable for all

3.4.1 Switching Function
The switching function is given as:
(3-48)

where P'(x,t)E

JR(n-m)x(n-m)

is a positive definite, symmetric matrix. Since the desired result
CJ,

is to have the switching function,

and the unmatched states, x 1 , converge to zero, it will

be useful to rearrange the switching function (3-48) into the following form:
(3-49)

Using the same method used in Section 3.3.1, the disturbance forces (3-47) can be expressed as follows:

azz The derivative of the second Lyapunov function is expressed as:

(3-70)

With the second Lyapunov function, the stability bounds on the system can be determined.

3.4.3 Stability Bounds
The region of stability for the state-dependent, time-varying controller is obtained using the same method as discussed in Section 3.3.3 for the LTI controller. The outer and inner boundaries on the region of stability are given by:

(3-71)

(3-72)

respectively. Again, any trajectory starting within :E will converge asymptotically towards

r,

and remain for all future time. It is important to note, however, that both :E and

r

are

now time dependent regions.

3.5 Relay Control
In the design of any control law, particularly for space applications, a major consideration is always on the reduction of fuel consumption. For the robust LTI and SDTV sliding mode controllers presented above, the switching control law:

u = -17sgn (a)

(3-73)

46

is subject to the undesirable effect known as chattering. In order to counteract the chattering effect, the more effective relay controller is introduced. The controller is expressed as follows:

(3-74)

where 8 is a positive constant. The relay controller derives its name from the similarity to a physical relay which experiences a momentary dead zone while being switched between states [26]. When the switching function is outside of the dead zone,

10'1 > 8,

the relay

control law (3-74) is identical to the switching controller (3-73) and it achieves improved performance by removing control action around the sliding manifold, which eliminates the chattering effect. Furthermore, since any control action while the system is within the interior

r

region has no guaranteed effect on the system behavior, eliminating the control input in

the region will conserve fuel that would otherwise be wasted.

3.5.1 Modified Boundary Conditions
With the relay controller, it is necessary to redevelop the boundaries on the systems stability. Three regions are provided that determine the behavior of the system. The first region defining the stability of the system is defined by:

(3-75)

which shows that the norm switching function will converge asymptotically towards 8. Upon reaching this point, the systems performance is governed by the derivation of the second Lyapunov function (3-36). The second region is given as:

(3-76)

47

where the norm of the switching function is bounded and the unmatched states,

jjx 1II,

will

converge asymptotically towards zero. The final, unstable interior region is given by the following expression:

(3-77)

Therefore, any trajectory starting in L. (3-75) converges asymptotically towards either L1 (3-76) or

r

(3-77). Any trajectory entering or starting in L1 (3-76) then converges

asymptotically to

r

(3-77). Thus, the relay controller is proven to be stable by Lyapunov

stability theory, i.e. Theorem 1. The regions of stability can be more easily visualized in Figure 3.3.

3.6 Conclusions
From the analysis presented in this Chapter, it has been successfully proven that both the conventional switching and relay laws can provide robust stability to LTI and statedependent, time-varying systems in the presence of both matched and unmatched disturbance forces. The tuning and hence performance of the controllers are dependent on the parameters

Q, which define the behavior of the sliding manifold, and 7J, which affects the reaching
operation of the controller. Furthermore, the relay control law is additionally dependent on the width of the dead zone, 8 , surrounding the sliding manifold. It is also apparent that the control output has been developed in the form of bang-bang style actuation, allowing for its application to typical thruster hardware on satellite systems. With the derivation of the new sliding mode control laws and their associated stability proofs, presented in this chapter, it is now possible to apply them to the underactuated satellite formation flying system.

Numerical Simulations

In this chapter, the proposed robust relay controllers developed in Chapter 3 are applied to the underactuated satellite formation system. The primary concern in the design of the controller is to maintain the projected formation. In order to ensure this requirement, the integral augmented Hill's equation and 2nd order approximation state space models developed in Section 2.2 are employed. Using the augmented system models, the LTI and SDTV relay controllers, proposed in Chapter 3, are applied to the augmented Hill and 2nd order models, respectively. In order to validate the control laws on the underactuated formation flying system, it is necessary to perform numerical simulations. The numerical simulations are developed through the SIMULINK® modeling environment in the MATLAB® programming system. The simulations are propagated through the use of a variable-step fourth order Runge-Kutta ordinary differential numerical integrator [49].

4. 1 Controller Design
The performance of the proposed controllers is determined by three parameters, the sliding manifold weighting matrix Q , the switching coefficient 17, and the dead zone width 8. In order to simplify the analysis, the weighting matrix is redefined as:

Q

= ql6x6

(4-1)

where q is a positive scalar and l 6x6 is a 6x6 identity matrix. Thus, the choice of the weighting matrix is reduced to the selection of the scalar q. In addition, the control weighting matrix has been chosen as R

=112x2 · Upon

substitution of the control weighting

matrix, eigenvalues in the robustness proof reduce to the eigenvalues of Q. Since the 51

augmented state space models are already in the specific state space form (3-8), the relay control laws for the underactuated satellite formation system is given as follows:

u = tqsgn (O"Y) for y 0 for u = { -qsgn ( z 0

!a.v! > 8 !a.v !~ 8

(4-2)

[: :] =

(4-4)

and P is the solution of the Riccati equation (3-4 ).

4.2 Simulation Model
The particular scenario considered here consists of formation operating in a near circular, sun-synchronous, low Earth orbit (LEO) with an altitude of 500 km. In the simulation, the system model is defined by Eq. (2-23), (2-24), and (2-25) for the relative motion between the leader and follower satellites, and by Eq. (2-1) and (2-2) for the motion of the leader satellite in orbit about the Earth. In order to maintain consistency throughout the analysis, all simulations use the parameters given in Table 4.1, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The dominant force acting on the formation is the differential J 2 force, see Section 2.4.1. Figure 4.1 shows the disturbance responses over the course of five orbits while the system follower satellite is in the projected formation. In the case of the state dependent, time varying sliding mode controller, the solution of the realizable differential Riccati equation is evaluated numerically. The matrix P in the case of the SDTV controller is initialized to the solution of the simpler algebraic Riccati equation. With the formation configuration and parameters defined, it is now possible to establish the controllers' stability bounds.

Formation Radius [km]

Figure 4.2: Matched and unmatched disturbance forces resulting from differential J 2 disturbance compared to formation radii

4.3 Robustness
The first step in defining the bounds on the stability is to develop the equations of the disturbance forces acting on the system. Referring to Eq. (3-9) the boundary approximations for a disturbance are restated as follows:

lid~ II~ aJ 1 l x1 II+ aJ2IIx2ll +fJ1

lld2ll ~ a21 llx~ II+ a22llx2ll +rllull +fl2

(4-5)

Using the relation between the disturbance forces and the formation radius as shown in Figure 4.2, the values of the coefficients in Eq. (4-5) can be derived. The values of the coefficients and constants of Eq. (4-5) are defined in Table 4.2.

4.4 Simulation Responses
In this section, the responses of two numerical simulations are presented. The first simulation assumes that the satellite formation starts in the formation with no initial error. The second simulation evaluates the controller when a 5% offset from the ideal initial positions is present.

4.4.1 Ideal Initial Conditions
The first simulation assumes that the follower satellite has no initial offset error from the desired formation trajectory. The specific starting conditions for the follower satellite are given in Table 4.4. The steady-state tracking errors as shown in Figure 4.3, demonstrate the stabilizing effect of the controller on the formation system. The y error, at steady-state, is bounded to within ±2m and is centered at zero. Similarly, the x error demonstrates a bounded steady-state operation in the range of ± 1.5 m. However, it is evident that the oscillations do not converge around zero but have a minor offset instead. The steady-state operation of the y error around zero and offset in the x error can be directly attributed to the presence of the integral error terms in the design of the sliding manifold. The z error, exhibits similar response to the x y error, demonstrating a bounded response to within the ± 1.5 m .

The control forces in the tangential and normal directions have fixed magnitudes of either 0 or ±lOmN/kg ; this behavior is better known as bang-bang style of control. When the control force profile is compared to the response of the switching functions, as shown in Figure 4.5, it is found that the control force acts to keep the switching function within the

57

dead zone boundary, 8. Furthermore, while the switching functions are within the dead zone region, no control action is taken.

Figure 4.4: Controller output response with ideal initial conditions

Finally, the responses of the LTI and SDTV relay controllers are found to be similar with slight variation in phase following the
5th

orbit. The probable cause for this difference might

be due to the DRE, which changes as a result of the initial controller activity and then eventually reach a steady-state response.

Figure 4.5: Switching function response with ideal initial conditions

4.4.2 Ten Percent Offset in Initial Conditions
In the second simulation, the system is initialized with a 5% offset in the position errors from the ideal formation. The initial values of the position errors and the norms of the switching functions and unmatched states are given in Table 4.5. From the robustness bounds defined in Section 4.2, the system starts within the region of convergence, .L. As a result, the formation tracking error states, and the switching function and unmatched state norms, are guaranteed to converge toward the inner stability region,

r.

The first response, as shown in Figure 4.6, clearly demonstrates the follower satellite's convergence towards the desired projected formation configuration. Similarly, the formation tracking error response shows convergence towards a region around the equilibrium, see Figure 4.7. In both the plots, it is quite evident that the overall system response is stable, which was guaranteed by the robustness of the control law.

Figure 4. 7: Tracking error response with 5% initial offset from ideal positions

Figure 4.8 shows the response of the control thrusters. During the first orbit, while the tracking errors converge towards the steady-state, the controller experiences a short continuous pulse followed by an intense period of high-frequency control actuation. The short pulse is a result of the controller driving the switching functions to the sliding manifold. The high-frequency oscillations are due to the follower not being in the desired trajectory, which only requires control action to counteract the disturbing forces and nonlinearities that were not included in the model approximations.

Figure 4.8: Controller response for 5% offset from ideal initial positions

The most interesting results are shown in the responses of the norms switching functions and unmatched states, given in Figure 4.9 and Figure 4.1 0, respectively. The trajectory of the norm of the switching function, which is initially within the .L convergence region, moves directly to the .d- r region, where it remains. This behavior was the expected result of the robustness analysis which guaranteed the convergence of the switching function to the .d- r if the trajectory started inside the .L region. Furthermore, since the norm of the switching functions is also the Lyapunov function, while in the .L region, the slope of the trajectory is negative, satisfying the Lyapunov stability. It is evident that the norm of the switching function converges within an extremely short period of time. However, this action only represents the reaching phase of the control law. The actual system states do not achieve steady-state for a full orbit.

62

Although the norm of the unmatched states begins within the .L region and enters the

r

region, it continues to demonstrate convergence to a much smaller value than was predicted by the robustness boundaries. It is important to note that the boundaries of

r

determine the

maximum outer bounds, but the norm trajectories may settle to a much smaller value, as is demonstrated in the response of Figure 4.1 0.

4.5 Controller Tuning and Performance Trade-Offs
In controlling the satellite formation , the performance of the formation is affected by several parameters. To achieve the desired performance, three tuning variables can be adjusted. The tuning variables are the sliding manifold gain, q; the switching coefficient, 17; and, the dead zone boundary width,

o. The following subsections analyze, through numerical simulations,

the effect of the control variables on the formation performance criteria proposed in Section

4.1.

4.5.1 Sliding Manifold Gain, q
The largest contributing factor affecting the performance of the controller is the design of the sliding manifold. As described in Section 4.1, the design of the sliding manifold can be reduced to the selection of a single positive constant gain, q . Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12

64

show the transient responses of the performance criteria of the formation system with a 5% initial offset for a range of q . It is apparent that, although each transient response shares a similar profile, the value of q is directly influencing the settling time of the transients. In the case of the tracking errors, increasing the values of q results in shorter response times of the transients . However, the
~V

performance demonstrates the opposite trend with decreasing

fuel consumption when q is increased, particularly for values of q > 1. Therefore, in order to achieve a settling time of within 1-2 orbits and reduce the total gain q = 0.5.

4.5.2 Switching Coefficient, f1
The second factor affecting the performance of the satellite formation is the switching coefficient, 1J. In Figure 4.13, a comparison between the performance criteria and the switching coefficient is provided. The formation tracking errors show no discernable relation to the switching coefficient. In contrast, for values of 1J > 2, the exponentially; after which, the

consumption decreases

becomes relatively constant. Therefore, choosing 1J::::: I 0

will reduce the fuel consumption to a reasonable level but ensure the controller is still capable of reaching the sliding manifold upon initialization.

Switching Coefficient, 11

Figure 4.13: Comparison of the switching coefficient against the formation performance criteria

4.5.3 Dead Zone Width, l>
The final controller parameter is the dead zone width, 8. Figure 4.14 shows the formation performance criteria against the width of the dead zone boundary. It is evident that for increasing values of 8, the formation tracking errors also increase. This is expected since the interior stability region

r,

which is a function 8, defines maximum expected steady-

state error. The .L\V performance shows the exact opposite trend. For values of 8 ~ 1, the
.L\ V remains constant with changes in the dead zone width; however, as 8 -7 0 the fuel

consumption begins to increase dramatically, by nearly an order of magnitude. This result is expected since at 8 = 0, the relay controller simplifies to the basic switching controller,

u = -17 sgn (a) . The switching controller attempts to bring the switching function to exactly
zero, which requires significantly greater control action, causes chattering, and provides no

67

significant improvement in the formation tracking error performance. Therefore, in order to reduce the fuel consumption and the tracking errors, the dead zone width should be chosen as 8:::::1.

4.6 Physical and Formation Parameters
Although the performance of the system can be adjusted through the careful selection of the control parameters q,17, and 8, there are many other factors that effect the performance of the system. The most significant factors are the phase and radius of the satellite formation, and the eccentricity of the leader satellite's orbit. The following subsections evaluate the effects of each of these variables on the formation performance.

68

4.6.1 Formation Phase, cp
As the leader-follower formation can be expanded to include multiple follower satellites, it is desirable to determine the effect of the phase of the follower on the formation performance criteria. A comparison of the formation's phase and the performance criteria is shown in Figure 4.15. Although the phase of the formation has no significant influence on the fuel consumption, it does demonstrate an effect on the tracking errors. In particular, minimums in the formation tracking errors occur when (jJ = 90° , 270° and maximums when (jJ = 30° , 210° .

4.6.2 Formation Radius, rd
Figure 4.16 shows the effects of formation radii on the performance criteria. It is evident that both the formation tracking errors and the fuel consumption all exhibit a positive linear relationship with increasing values of the radius. It is interesting to note that although the

69

formation tracking error is increasing with the larger formations, the ratio of the tracking error to the formation radius stays constant at approximately 0.3%.

Formation Radius, rd [km]

Figure 4.16: Comparison of the satellite formation radius against the performance criteria

4.6.3 Formation Eccentricity, e
A critical factor affecting the behavior of the satellite formation is the eccentricity of the leader satellite's orbit. As shown in Figure 4.17, the formation performance criteria are measured against the eccentricity of the leader satellite. Although no direct effect is evident between the eccentricity and the tracking performance, there is a clear degradation in the
~V

performance with increasing eccentricity. However, the more important result is the difference between the LTI and SDTV relay controllers. Although it would be expected that the SDTV relay controller should perform better since it is able to account for some of the system nonlinearities, which increase with eccentricity, the LTI relay controller uses the

70

optimal solution of the ARE as opposed to the SDTV relay controller which uses the realizable solution of the DRE. The result is the optimal solution of the ARE in fact performs better than the realizable DRE solution.

Eccentricity of Leader Satellite, e

Figure 4.17: Comparison of the eccentricity of the leader satellite's orbit and the performance criteria

4. 7 Conclusions
The results of the numerical simulations have revealed many important properties of the relay controllers' effects on the underactuated satellite formation . First and foremost, the theoretical stability and robustness bounds predicted by Chapter 3 were verified through the numerical simulations. Second, through careful selection of the control parameters, the system can be tuned to provide relatively good performance. Finally, the performances of both the controllers were found to be similar in most cases.

71

72

Chapter 5
Conclusions & Future Work
In this thesis, the control of an underactuated satellite formation using robust nonlinear techniques was examined. Two new sliding mode control laws were developed in Chapter 3, the first using the linear, time-invariant model of the formation system, also known as the Hill's equations, and the second using a
2nd

approximation of the equations of motion.

Regions of stability, in the presence of matched and unmatched disturbing forces, were determined for both controllers. The control laws were further advanced by modifying them into the form of a relay sliding mode control, which incorporates a dead zone boundary around the sliding manifold, the desired effect being a reduction in fuel consumption and the chattering effect. Through the numerical simulations, presented in Chapter 4, the robustness of the proposed control laws were demonstrated to match the theoretical robustness boundaries determined from Chapter 3.

5. 1 Conclusions
The most significant result of the study has been the development of the robust sliding mode control methods for the underactuated satellite formation system. This represents a significant step forward since the previous control methodologies applied to the system have not explicitly considered controller's stability in the presence of disturbing forces. A secondary result was the use of the
2nd

order approximation of the equations of motion in the

design of the control law, where only the Hill's equation had been applied previously. It was found that the state dependent, time varying control law did not show any noticeable improvement in the performance. Through numerical simulations, the control laws were tested against a range of tuning parameters and formation variations. The results of the simulation showed that controllers could be tuned to achieve steady-state formation tracking errors within ±5 m and
~V

73

consumption on the order of I xI o- { m/ s) /orbit. Although larger degradation in the
3

controller performance occurred for more extreme formation radii, i.e. rd > 3 km , and orbital eccentricities, i.e. e > 0.005, this would be expected since the nonlinear equations of motion would start to show significant deviations from the Hill's and equations.
2nd

order approximation

5.2 Future Work
Despite the advances in the control of the underactuated satellite formation developed in this thesis, the control laws have only been tested within a small range test conditions. The first recommendation, therefore, is to expand the range of testing scenarios for the proposed control laws. This includes the use of alternative formation configurations, larger parameters variations and high-fidelity models of the disturbing forces, and extending the simulations over larger time-spans to evaluate the long-term fuel consumption. The second area of development is to evaluate the performance of robust control laws in the task of formation reconfiguration. The third improvement in the development of the underactuated satellite formation is to redevelop the robust control laws in the discrete time domain. As the final spacecraft hardware is only capable discrete operation, the advancement to discrete control laws is a necessity.
