ABSTRACT
Ciprofloxacin Effects on Nitrogen Cycling in Aquatic Sediments Monisa Nandi Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management September 2009 Ryerson University Four experiments were designed to assess the effect of ciprofloxacin (cipro) on the function of microbial populations in freshwater environments, specifically on nitrogen cycling. Cipro is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic used in the treatment of both human and veterinary pathogenic diseases. Previous studies reported the presence of cipro in aquatic environments. This study investigates whether cipro has adverse effects on environmental bacteria which perform critical ecosystem processes associated with the nitrogen cycle. Microcosms containing sediment and synthetic lake water were amended with a series of environmentally relevant concentrations of cipro ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg cipro per kg of sediment. Nitrogen cycling processes including nitrification, denitrification and ammonification were measured using a combination of flux· measurements (NH4+, N0 3-, N0 2 -), stable isotope techniques

dilution) and changes in N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar using Membrane Isotope Mass Spectroscopy (MIMS). Results indicate that cipro has a dose-dependent effect on nitrification, while denitrification is dependent on nitrate availability and may be stimulated by cipro. Ammonification and respiration were not affected at these concentrations. Impacts on nitrification and denitrification are likely to be realized only at the highest concentrations measured in the environment. At the lower end of the environmentally relevant concentratjon range, observed impacts are not likely to be ecologically important, especially when averaged over an entire lake ecosystem. Pageiv

INTRODUCTION
Pharmaceuticals in the Environment

The growth of modem society has led to an associated increase in the use of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in humans as well as in agricultural and aquaculture activities (Daughton and Jones-Lepp, 2001 ).

In 2003 in the United States (US), prescription drug spending was US$227 .5 billion, comprising

approximately 10% of national health care spending and was three times larger than in 1997 (US National Health Expenditures Tables, 2007). Canada's total drug expenditure has increased steadily from $3.8 billion to $16.7 billion between 1985 and 2001. In 2001, drug expenditure represented over 16% of total health care expenditure and was ranked third in drug expenditure per capita after the US and France (CIH, 2004). In 2007, Canadians spent $665 million on oral antibiotics out of a total almost $19 billion on prescription drugs (Morgan et al., 2008).

Furthermore, addition of antibiotics to animal feed is a significant non-medical use of antibiotics in North America for the purpose of growth promotion. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that approximately 11.2 million kilograms (kg) (24.6 million pounds) of antimicrobials are used for non-therapeutic uses in the US compared to 1.4 million kg (3 million pounds) in human medicine or between 70% and 85% of total antimicrobial use (Mellon et al., 2001 ). Administering antibiotics to livestock stimulates growth and accelerates the time taken to get the animal to market. The addition of 25 mg penicillin per pound of chicken feed saves 900 million kg (2 billion pounds) of feed per year (Madigan et al., 2000). These antibiotics are likely to inhibit organisms responsible for low grade infections and reduce intestinal epithelial inflammation thereby promoting nutrient uptake and improving feeding efficiency (Madigan et al., 2000). Veterinarians also prescribe human drugs to prevent disease or treat illness in a practice referred to as off-label use (Holtz, 2006).

Recent research has shown the prevalence of various pharmaceuticals entering the environment from water treatment plants, agricultural and aquaculture practices and landfills throughout the world (Daughton and Jones-Lepp, 2001). Richardson and Bowron (1985) reported and studied the presence and fate of various pharmaceuticals in a river downstream from homes and hospitals in North London. Hirsch et al. (1999) analyzed water samples collected from river water and sewage treatment plant effluents in Germany for 18 antibiotic substances and reported concentrations of antibiotics up to 6 J..Lg/L. Zuccato et al. (2000) measured low levels of clofibric acid, diazepam and tylosin in Italian drinking water. Kolpin et al. (2002) conducted the first comprehensive study of 95 pharmaceuticals, hormones and other organic wastewater contaminants in 139 streams across 30 states in North America between 1999 and 2000 and reported 31 antibiotics with concentrations up to 1.9 Jlg/L. Jacobsen and Berglind (1988) and Coyne et al. ( 1994) reported high concentrations of the antibiotic oxytetracycline in sediments beneath fish farms.

PPCPs can have far-reaching, but often little considered, effects on the environment. Although not traditionally considered contaminants, pharmaceuticals are designed for a variety of uses and are intended to target a variety of organisms. Therefore, they may have unanticipated effects on non-target organisms. For example, avermectins (antiparasitic drugs used in agriculture and aquaculture) were very toxic to crustaceans with LC 50 values ranging from 0.0026 J..Lg/L to 22 J..Lg/L. Ivermectin has been measured in surface/subsurface runoff in concentrations less than 1.1 mg/L to 4.4 mg/L (Boxall et al., 2004). In comparison, the chronic and acute toxicity of phosmet (an organophosphate pesticide) ranged from 0.0056 mg/L (EC 50 for daphnids) to 0.07 mg/L (LC 50 for fish) (Boxall et al., 2004). This indicates a much higher toxicity of the pharmaceutical compared to the pesticide.

Studies have shown reproductive behavioural changes at very low doses of pharmaceuticals such as anti-depressants. Carbamazepine, an antiepileptic and anti-depressant, was used to assess inhibition of Chironomus riparius emergence. C. riparius is a non-biting midge that serves as an important food source for many fish and other organisms and is frequently the most abundant

Page 12

insect in freshwater ecosystems (Nentwig et.al, 2004). No acutely toxic effects from aquatic exposure were observed. However, a chronic effect (significantly reduced emergence of larvae) was observed at a sediment concentration of 1.25 mg/kg dry weight. At sediment concentrations of 2.5 mg/kg dry weight, more than 90% inhibition was observed followed by total inhibition and arrested development at higher concentrations (Nentwig et al., 2004).

Schulte-Oehlmann et al. (2004) conducted a study to assess the effects of synthetic steroids on the freshwater snail Marisa cornuarietis. Both 17 a-methyltestosterone (MT) and 17 a-ethinylestradiol (EE2) induced virilisation (i.e. development of male reproductive organs) in female M cornuarietis (Schulte-Oehlmann et al., 2004). Similar results from a different study indicated that EE2 induced feminization of the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca (Vandenbergh et al., 2003).

Although pharmaceutical toxicity studies provide comprehensive pharmacological and clinical effects, little to no assessment is completed for ecotoxicity or ecosystem effects (Richardson and Bowron, 1985; Seiler, 2002; Hartemann, 2004), especially for chronic effects (Webb, 2004a). Even more troubling are the effects of continual life-cycle, multi-generational exposure to aquatic organisms. Antibiotics may increase the incidence of multi-resistant strains of bacteria especially in areas around aquaculture and agriculture operations (Midtvedt, 2004). Kandeler et al. (1995) reported a significant decrease in respiration, nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in soils exposed to heavy metals. Effects may occur so gradually as to be undetected leading to irreversible change that may instead be attributed to naturally occurring evolutionary change (Daughton and Ternes, 1999). Furthermore, although environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals may be low, the additive or synergistic effects may be considerable (Daughton and Jones-Lepp, 2001 ).

For decades, pharmaceuticals have not been considered a problem because their concentrations were often too low to be measured and their effects were too small to be observed. With recent advances in technology, and increasing use of pharmaceuticals leading to increased prevalence in

Page 13

the natural environment, this has become an emerging field of study, first in Europe and later in North America. Although preventing the use of pharmaceuticals is not an acceptable solution, their widespread presence in the environment could be reduced in order to mitigate those effects on non-target organisms, to avoid development of resistance in disease organisms and to prevent ecological toxicity and ecosystem effects.

1.1.1

Sources and Fate of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment

Pharmaceuticals can potentially enter all four major environmental compartments from a variety of routes: surface water (from waste water and overland runoff), soil (from sewage sludge, manure and biosolids application), sediment (from overland runoff and direct surface water application) and groundwater (through leaching and percolation) (Diaz-Cruz et al., 2003; Kiimmerer, 2004).

Excretion from humans and animals, as well as disposal of unused inventory, are major sources of pharmaceuticals found in the environment. Disposal and discharge into the environment from domestic and industrial effluent and surface water runoff result in continuous input into the environment (Daughton and Ternes, 1999). Disposal of human and animal waste into the environment is usually by emission into water resources via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (Bound and Voulvoulis, 2005). Generally, WWTPs are reactive, rather than proactive, to new environmental pollutants so there is often a lag period during which time new contaminants are emitted to the environment before they are perceived as a problem. As pharmaceuticals are not widely considered to be environmental contaminants, flushing into municipal WWTPs is considered a safe and effective method of disposal. Furthermore, institutional disposal methods, thought to be a significant source of pharmaceutical input into the environment, have their own set of practical considerations. In many parts of the US, strict disposal regulations mean that many institutions must flush away unused medications as the most effective means of disposal within the law (Daughton, 2003a).

Page 14

A secondary route of exposure is the agricultural application of biosolids on land (Bound and Voulvoulis, 2005). From this point, pharmaceuticals may bind to soil, run off to surface water or groundwater or undergo biodegradation (Boxall et al., 2004.

Some pharmaceuticals are highly persistent and are not broken down in the environment. However, accumulation in the body is not generally a desired property for pharmaceuticals (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2000). In order to promote uptake in the body, the vast majority of pharmaceuticals are designed to be soluble in water (Ktimmerer, 2001a). Boxall et.al. (2004, 2004a) reported half-lives for various veterinary pharmaceuticals in soil, manure, sediment and surface water. In soil, half-lives ranged from less than 1 day for penicillin to greater than 1 year for emamectin benzoate (an avermectin antiparasitic drug) (Boxall et al., 2004a). Half-lives in manure were significantly less, ranging from a couple of days for tylosin (an antiparasitic drug) to greater than 3 months for some antibiotics (quinolones and tetracyclines) (Boxall et al., 2004). Half-lives in sediments are highly variable, ranging from less than 1 day to greater than 1 year for oxytetracycline. Half-lives for fluoroquinolones range from just over one month to almost one year (Boxall et al., 2004a).

In general, pharmaceuticals are less persistent in water than in soil because they are generally

designed to be soluble to promote uptake in the gastrointestinal tract of treated organisms. Quinolones and tetracyclines that had half-lives greater than three months in manure have considerably shorter half-lives in water, ranging from less than one hour to three hours (Boxall et al., 2004a). Wastewater is generally the predominant transport pathway into the environment (Lishman et al., 2006) and the effects of pharmaceuticals are most often observed and studied in surface water.

Finally, the application of pharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics, in aquaculture through feed additives or direct application to surface water has an impact on benthic sediments in both marine and aquatic environments. According to Cabello (2006), industrial aquaculture worldwide has increased fourfold in the last 20 years. Antibiotics are administered in feed or as

Page 15

baths or injections to prevent infection resulting from increased population density, crowding, lack of sanitary barriers and failure to isolate infected animals. Where aquaculture and agriculture are integrated, practices that use manure and other agricultural residues as fish feed are widespread (Cabello, 2006). Approximately 70 to 80% of medicated feed ends up in the environment (Hektoen et al., 1995). These practices allow residual quantities to build up in sediments altering microbial composition and exerting selection pressure (Cabello, 2006). Pharmaceuticals applied to water can enter sediments without undergoing any attenuation processes which may lead to locally high concentrations (Kummerer, 2004a). These drugs may be either degraded or released back into the overlying water (Hirsch et al., 1999).

Although some pharmaceuticals are in fact as persistent in the environment as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), a great deal more pharmaceuticals take on a "pseudo-persistent" quality as a result of this continual replenishment which effectively compensates for any transformation and removal that may occur in the environment (Daughton and Ternes, 1999). This "pseudopersistence" resulting from continuous input into the environment can be considered to cause ongoing pollution and potentially lead to chronic toxicity. Specifically, non-target organisms in soil and water may be affected by continuous, sub-therapeutic levels of pharmaceuticals (Daughton, 2003b ). These effects have only recently begun to be documented and assessed.

While it seems that indirect exposure to pharmaceuticals via drinking water is not a significant threat to humans (Kolpin et al., 2002; Heberer, 2002), indirect risks to humans include increased microbial resistance to disease treatment, potential uptake through consumption of treated foods (e.g. grain, animals) (Boxall, 2004) and the implications ofunanticipated effects on other organisms in lakes, rivers, streams and soils for ecosystem health.

1.1.2

Fluoroquinolones

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are a subset of quinolone antibiotics, a class of widely prescribed broad-spectrum antibacterials. They are totally synthetic compounds, active against many grampositive and some gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and licensed as broad-spectrum antibiotics for human (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin) and veterinary use (enrofloxacin, danofloxacin) (Alder et al., 2004).

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) are a relatively new class of antibiotic compound. Our understanding of their environmental behaviour, fate and effects is still limited compared to our knowledge of traditional environmental contaminants such as metals, hydrocarbons and pesticides. In 1962, nalidixic acid was isolated as a by-product in the synthesis of chloroquine. Two years later, nalidixic acid was in general practice for treatment of urinary tract infections. Modifications to the basic structure of nalidixic acid yielded new derivatives including oxolinic acid, piperamic acid and piromidic acid. These are considered the first-generation quinolones. The first fluoroquinolone, flumequine, was synthesised in 1973. The synthesis of norfloxacin in 1980 included two fundamental structural modifications: a fluorine atom at C6 and an aliphatic cyclic amine (piperazine N-alkylpiperazine) at C7. Absorption ofFQs is much higher and metabolism much lower than compared to the first generation of quinolones (Martorell et al., 1993).

FQs are rapidly degraded in surface water by ultraviolet light but are insensitive to hydrolysis and temperature (Sections 1.2.3 and 1.2.4). Several authors have shown that FQs partition to organic matter, both within the water column and in sediments. FQs are of environmental concern because of their tendency to sorb to sediments and therefore persist in the environment (Section 1.2.5) and, together with their unfavourable toxicity profile (Section 1.2.6) (Go let et al., 2002) may affect microbial populations in sediments (Sections 1.2. 7 and 1.2.8).

Page 17

Ciprofloxacin (cipro) is the most widely prescribed FQ followed by ofloxacin (Pi co and Andreu, 2007). The global value of cipro sales exceeded US$1.3 billion by November 1999. Ciprofloxacin was listed as number 32 among the most prescribed medications in 2001 and represented about 50% of the prescriptions of quinolines in Canada in 2000 and 2001 (Basic and Clinical Pharmacology as cited in Pico and Andreu, 2007). Reflecting the relative rates of prescription of quinolone antimicrobials in Canada, ciprofloxacin, norflaxacin, and ofloxacin have been detected in WWTP effluents, with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin most frequently detected (Miao et al., 2004).

After being administered, pharmaceuticals are subject to modification through metabolic processes. These include hydroxylation, cleavage or glucuronation by enzymes produced in the liver to promote water solubility and excretion. However, a significant portion of the original, unmetabolized drug will leave via urine or feces. These metabolites may have significant residual activity or even be transformed back into the original active drug (Hirsch et al., 1999). Therefore, the presence of any given pharmaceutical in wastewater is dependent on dosage and metabolism (hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, conjugation reactions) (Cunningham, 2004). Many pharmaceuticals are only partially metabolized before excretion from humans and animals, and continue to be broken down during the transport process (Ki.immerer, 2001a). Metabolism rates of FQs are variable. Approximately 10% of enrofloxacin is excreted unmetabolised in animals (Vancutsum et al., 1990 as cited in Hailing-Sorensen et al., 1998). Humans excrete unmetabolized ciprofloxacin at a rate of 45 to 62% and norfloxacin at a rate of 20 to 40% in urine. In feces, 15 to 25% of ciprofloxacin is excreted unmetabolized and approximately 28% of norfloxacin is excreted umetabolized (Kuhlmann et al., 1997).

Furthermore, Golet et al. (2003) found that FQs are stable during methanogenesis and biodegradation is of minor importance compared to sorption during tertiary sewage treatment using activated sludge. Therefore, FQs enter the environment through both solid and aqueous matrices largely unmetabolized, and then persist in the organic matrix of sludge.

1.1.3

Mode of Action

FQs inhibit many gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria. FQs interfere with bacterial DNA synthesis by inhibiting the enzymes Topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) in gram-negative and Topoisomerase IV in gram-positive bacteria. The inhibition of these enzymes prevents growth and eventually results in death of the bacterial cells (Hooper, 2001 ). DNA topoisomerases have been isolated from a variety of different organisms including viral (Shuman and Moss, 1987), prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources (Reece et al., 1991; Huang, 1994) indicating that FQs may inhibit cell growth in other organisms.

1.1.4

Environmental Occurrence

FQs were first measured in North American surface waters in 2002 in the ng/L range (Kolpin et al., 2002). In Europe, quinolones and FQs have been detected in sediments and fauna in the
~g/g

range by various authors and in soil and sediments at varying concentrations

depending on the physical and chemical characteristics of the matrix (Bjorklund et al., 1991; Samuelsen et al., 1992; Kolpin et al., 2002; Golet et al., 2003; Metcalfe et al., 2004; Nakata et al., 2005). Bjorklund et al. (1991) reported concentrations of oxolinic acid in sediments ranging from <0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg in five days after treatment in sediments beneath fish farms in the Baltic Sea off the south-west coast of Finland. Samuelsen (1992) reported the halflife of oxolinic acid in the sediments beneath a fish farm off the coast of Norway was 48 days. Nakata et al. (2005) investigated quinolones in wastewater effluents and rivers/lakes in the US and Canada and reported ofloxacin concentrations of 204 ng/L and 100 ng/L in secondary and tertiary WWTP effluents, respectively. Mass flow calculations put total river discharge at 4.8 g cipro per day of discharge from a single WWTP.

Metcalfe et al. (2004) reported FQs in surface waters around WWTPs in 5 Canadian cities. Concentrations ofFQs were measured in the nanogram per Litre range in effluents discharged from the WWTPs. In the surface waters around the same WWTPs, concentrations ranged from below detection limits to greater than 500 ng/L indicating some attenuation processes, likely

dilution, were occurring. The median concentration of cipro was 0.011 J..Lg/L with a maximum measured concentration of 0.015 J..Lg/L. Samples were collected from the Otonabee River, Hamilton Harbour, Detroit River and Little River in Ontario (Metcalfe et al., 2004).

In a Swiss study, cipro comprised almost 50% of the total FQ mass flow entering the WWTP

(93 g/d) with concentrations ranging from 233 to 568 ng/L. Final effluent cipro concentrations ranged from 62 to 106 ng/L (Go let et al., 2002).

1.1.5

Fate in Surface Water

In general, microbial degradation of antibiotics is slower in surface water compared to WWTPs

due to lower density and diversity of bacteria. FQs are insensitive to hydrolysis and temperature change relative to degradation rates of other antibiotics such as penicillin. However, photodegradation plays an important role in degradation of FQs in surface water (Alexy et al., 2004).

FQs that had half-lives greater than three months in manure have considerably shorter half-lives in surface water, ranging from less than one hour to three hours (Boxall et al., 2004a). HailingSorensen (2000) reported the half-life of ciprofloxacin ranged from 1.6 to 2.5 days in two bioreactors with activated sludge although there was no accounting for sorption or photodegradation.

1.1.6

Photodegradation

Photodegradation in the photic zone of surface waters may result in significant degradation as FQs are degraded by UV light (Alexy et al., 2004). Photodegradation is important because the process eliminates FQs whereas sorption simply partitions them into another compartment exposing different organisms and possibly creating a source for future release. As light intensity in surface waters is dependent on climate and latitude, photodegradation is likely to be a variable fate mechanism for different geographic locations at different times of the year.

Mesotrophic mid-latitude light intensity

Cardoza et al., (2005), evaluated the rate of 250 J.lg/L C-ciprofloxacin disappearance in surface waters under different light, dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) conditions to determine when photodegradation vs. adsorption dominates fate. The authors conducted three laboratory scale and one field scale experiment under conditions of mesotrophic mid-latitude light intensity. Rapid photodegradation (half-life of approximately 1.5 hours) occurred with numerous photodegradation products when POC levels were low. However, photodegradation was significantly reduced when moderate amounts of POC were present in the water column. Soluble ciprofloxacin disappearance rates were accelerated and no degradation products were detected at moderate POC levels relative to low POC levels.

The influence of DOC on ciprofloxacin fate was negligible. In the dark, prior to light exposure, no significant disappearance was observed. After light was provided, ciprofloxacin disappeared rapidly with a typical half-life of 4.6 ± 0.4h. No significant difference in half-life was observed for DOC ranging from 5.36 to 38.13 mg C/L (Cardoza et al., 2005).

The final lab scale experiment indicated that elevated POC resulted in rapid disappearance of soluble phase ciprofloxacin after 15 minutes, regardless of light and DOC conditions. Ciprofloxacin sorption to POC was also substantially higher at lower pH (pH 3.0 compared to pH 7.8) by almost 1 order of magnitude (Cardoza et al., 2005).

A lower ciprofloxacin concentration of 25 J.!g/L was used for the mesocosm study which consisted of six tanks deployed in a protected reservoir. The tanks were microbially seeded using sediment trays and covered to insulate against rapid changes in air temperature. Three of the six tanks were covered with black PVC lids. DOC and POC concentrations were low and secondary nutrient levels were representative of lower mesotrophic levels. Ciprofloxacin concentrations were monitored over 12 days at which point the lids were removed. In the open tanks, ciprofloxacin dropped rapidly and was not detectable after the first 5 hours. In the covered

Page 21

tanks, ciprofloxacin was relatively persistent over 120 hours. The lids were removed after 290 hours to obtain more data. First order half-lives were between 0.97 and 1.14 hours in the covered tanks (Cardoza et al., 2005).

The authors concluded that that both mechanisms (photodegradation and adsorption) are conditionally significant to ciprofloxacin fate in surface waters, and that determining the fate of ciprofloxacin adsorbed onto solids is an important aspect of its ultimate fate (Cardoza et al., 2005).

Effect of pH and particle size

Belden et al., (2007), investigated the effect of fine and coarse particulate matter (FPOM and CPOM) on sorption of ciprofloxacin at environmentally relevant pHs of 5 and 7.5 (above and below the lower pKa value of 5.9). FPOM consisted of sugar maple leaves processed by
Hyalella azteca and filtered to less than 63 Jlm. CPOM consisted of leaves cut into 1.1 em

diameter discs. Soil collected from a fallow field was used as control sediment. The sorption coefficient (Ki) is the ratio of a substance's total equilibrium concentrations in the sorbed phase and in the solution (Schwarzenbach et al., 1993).

KI for CPOM was an order of magnitude lower

than partition coefficients for sediment and FPOM. The effect of pH was most significant in sediments where lower pH led to greater sorption because, above pKa the compound ionizes, although this was minimal compared to matrix effects.

The authors concluded that further studies are required to investigate specific changes in organic material such as increased oxidation and surface area that may lead to increased sorption. Furthermore, greater binding to FPOM may prolong the environmental half-life of FQs and species within that ecosystem niche such as stream invertebrates that utilize FPOM as a food source may be more susceptible to contamination by FQs (Belden et al., 2007).

Page 22

1.1.7

Fate in Sediments

Studies have shown that sorption of FQs to organic matter is an important removal process in wastewater treatment (Giger et al., 2003; Golet et al., 2003; Kiimmerer et al., 2001). Golet et al. (2003) reported that the cipro concentrations in sewage sludge (3.1 mg/kg) from a Swiss WWTP were over four orders of magnitude higher than raw sewage (427 ng/L). Cipro concentrations in treated tertiary effluent were 71 ng/L (Golet et al., 2003). Lindberg et al. (2007) reported cipro concentrations ranging from 1.4 to 1. 7 mg/kg in digested dewatered sewage sludge. There is little data on bioavailability of FQs but similar sorption mechanisms may result in FQ binding and sequestration in benthic sediments. Cordova-Krey1os and Snow (2007) published cipro sorption in sediments at log KI = 2.90 to 4.27 which was similar to previous studies by Golet et al. (2003) (log Kd = 4.29, pH= 7.5 - 8.4) and Giger et al. (2003) (log KI = 2.62, pH= 6.5). The octanol-water partition coefficient, log

Koc, was positively correlated with clay content

but not with organic carbon content (C6rdova-Kreylos and Snow, 2007). These data are somewhat contradictory to the information published in the previous studies by Belden et al., (2007) and Cardoza et al., (2005).

Benthic sediments are critical for nutrient cycling processes and as habitat for organisms. They are also often a sink for environmental contaminants and may therefore also provide a source via resuspension and bioturbation by benthic organisms. Approximately 70 to 80% of medicated feed ends up ·in the environment (Hektoen et al., 1995). Rapid sedimentation is typical at many aquaculture operations because debris consisting of feces and uneaten food accumulates beneath the fish enclosures, where sediments containing persistent pharmaceuticals may quickly build up (Boxall et al., 2005). Similarly, FQs released from WWTPs or feed lots may partition onto organic matter and settle, transferring the contaminant to sediments.

Half-lives of FQs in sediments vary between studies from just over one month for oxolinic acid to almost one year for flumequine, oxolinic acid and sarafloxacin (Boxall et al., 2004a). Hektoen et al. (1995) investigated the persistence of oxolinic acid (1st generation quinolone), flumequine (1st FQ) and sarafloxacin and other antibiotics at 4 depth intervals from 1-7 em from Page 23

sediment cores and found that, despite FQ sorption to sediments, FQs in sediments continued to be toxic to algae after approximately180 days. Half-lives ofoxolinic acid ranged from 151 days at surface to greater than 300 days at depths of 5 to 7 em. Half-lives of flumequine ranged from 60 to greater than 300 days. Half-lives of sarafloxacin were similarly highly variable. While there was no discussion on possible FQ bioavailability, top layer residues depurated more rapidly and bottom layers were near initial concentrations suggesting leaching not degradation was causing redistribution (Hektoen et al., 1995).

Due to the challenges of FQ toxicity testing, the results have been highly variable.

Robinson et al., (2005), investigated the effects of 7 FQs on Pseudokirchneriella subcapita (formerly Selenastrum capricornutum), Microcystis aeruginosa, algal species for two divisions Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae, duckweed (Lemna minor), Daphnia magna and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The data show that the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa is about two orders of magnitude more sensitive to six out of seven FQs with a median EC 50 of 49 ug/L compared to a much higher value for P.subcapita (median EC 50 7,400 ug/L). The authors reported chlorosis of new duckweed (Lemna minor) fronds produced during the course of their experiment and it was the second most sensitive organism with median EC 50 at 106 ug/L. One explanation posed was that chloroplasts are prokaryotic in nature and may have similar metabolic pathways as cyanobacteria and may therefore be susceptible to the same mode of action. However, no such observations were made in P. subcapita so it is unclear why that organism is less sensitive (Robinson et al., 2005).

The same study briefly discussed the stability of FQs during the 7 -day daily static renewal tests and found that lower concentrations were less stable and showed larger declines at the end of the tests. There was some indication that this may be due to adsorption onto algal cells but the study also did not account for the effects of photodegradation. Therefore, these EC 50 values likely underestimate toxicity because they were based on concentrations at the start of the test. The authors concluded that future research should examine the effects of FQs on aquatic bacterial communities such as microbial resistance and disruption of nutrient cycles (Robinson et al., 2005).

Backhaus and Grimme ( 1999) demonstrated inhibition in function (bioluminescence) of

Vibrio fischeri (marine bacteria) as a result of antibiotic exposure. EC 50 ranged from 13.5 f.lg/L
for ofloxacin to 0.206 mg/L for nalidixic acid (Backhaus and Grimme, 1999). A later study completed by the same authors examined the effects of FQs on V. fischeri and reported EC 50 concentrations ranging from 13.59 f.lg/L for oflaxacin to 1.02 mg/L for pipemidic acid (Backhaus

Page 25

and Grimme, 2000). Backhaus and Grimme concluded that the impact of antibiotics on ecosystem functions such as nitrification processes should be investigated (Backhaus and Grimme, 2000).

Froehner et al. (2000) reported that the standardized (bioluminescence) short-term acute toxicity test (30 minutes) underestimated toxicity of nalidixic acid to Vibrio fischeri (i.e. no toxicity effects detected) but two longer term tests conducted over 7 hours and 24 hours predicted delayed toxicity to within a factor of 2. The EC 50 for the 7-hour growth inhibition test was 0.12 mg/L (0.5 0.21 mg/L (0.9
~mol/L) ~mol/L).

and the EC 50 for the 24-hour bioluminescence inhibition assay was As the mechanism of action for FQs involves inhibition of enzymes,

effects are more likely to be demonstrated during the longer-term tests (Froehner et al., 2000). Given that the process of nitrogen cycling takes longer than 30 minutes, effects should be measured over several hours to days.

W ollenberger et al. (2000), conducted acute and chronic toxicity tests of various antibiotics including oxolinic acid on Daphnia magna. The reported 24-hour and 48-hour EC 50 values were 5.9 mg/L and 4.6 mg/L, respectively. The authors found that toxicity values for bacteria were two to three orders of magnitude lower than toxicity values for higher trophic levels such as crustaceans. In the reproductive test with oxolinic acid, no test organisms survived for the test duration at oxolinic acid concentrations greater than 0.75 mg/L. This is significant because oxolinic acid is used commonly in fish farming (Wollenberger et al., 2000).

1.1.9

Ecosystem Impacts of Fluoroquinolones

One question that has not been answered is what effect FQs may have on nutrient cycling mediated by microorganisms. Both cyanobacteria and green algae display sensitivity to, and shifts in population dynamics in the presence of, antibiotics (Harass et al., 1985). Effects on algae have been observed at low doses and are comparable with similar industrial chemicals labelled as toxic in the aquatic environment (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2000). These effects may

Page 26

occur so gradually as to be undetected leading to irreversible change that may instead be attributed to naturally occurring evolutionary change (Daughton and Ternes, 1999). Algae form the basis of the food chain and small decreases in algal populations such as Chiarella spp. and Pseudokirchneriella (formerly Selenastrum) spp. caused by antibiotics such as metronidazole may have significant effects on ecosystem balance (Lanzky and Hailing-Sorensen, 1997; Alexy et al., 2004).

Inhibition of bacteria by antibiotics may also affect biogeochemical cycles (e.g. carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus) as well as decomposition of organic matter. Due to their function and widespread presence, microorganisms can be environmentally relevant indicators of pollution. Adaptation of a community through replacement of sensitive species with resistant organisms may result in significant ecological effects (van Beelen and Doelman, 1997). Long-term chronic exposure to low concentrations may cause gradual shifts in community structure and gradual changes in community function.

1.1.1 0 Effects on Community Composition and Function

Knapp et al. (2005), assessed both the fate and effects of enrofloxacin in a field mesocosm (surface water) and monitored microbial community changes using DGGE, enrofloxacin disappearance and ciprofloxacin formation using LC/MS. Variable light conditions were used to simulate different portions of the water column. This was essentially a follow up to the study by Cardoza et al. (2005), mentioned previously in Section 1.1.6. The study concluded that the microbial community was not significantly affected either in terms of diversity or apparent resistance.

Al-Ahmad et al., (1999), investigated cipro biodegradation rate using growth inhibition, colony forming units (CFUs) and a Closed Bottle Test (CBT). High inhibition of Pseudomonas putida was observed in the growth inhibition test but only a weak effect in the CFU monitoring and none in the CBT. In the presence of cipro, bacteria still grew and formed visible colonies within

Page 27

the incubation period specified for the test. However, these colonies might have been smaller than those formed on agar without cipro if growth was inhibited. The CFU test does not consider colony size. Furthermore, none of the compounds was readily biodegradable. The authors attributed these results to inactivation of the compound by sorption (i.e. low bioavailability of the compounds). Ki.immerer et al. (200 1), investigated the biodegradability, and hence the elimination of genotoxicity, of cipro and ofloxacin using growth inhibition, CFUs and a CBT. According to the results of the CBT, neither of the FQs was considered readily biodegradable over a 40 day period. Although growth inhibition was present over 8 days for cipro and 11 days for ofloxacin, the inhibition disappeared. 50% growth inhibition for cipro occurred at 80 J..Lg/L and at 10 J..Lg/L for ofloxacin. The CFU results indicated only a minority of the aquatic species monitored were inhibited. The authors noted that these tests are more relevant to the most numerable species and further studies are required to assess the effects of these compounds on whole population dynamics. These tests and the test by Knapp et al. (2005) indicated little effect of FQs on the assessed microbial community, but they did not address effects on specific guilds or clades of microorganisms, or on community function.

Benthic Macroinvertebrates

Maul et al. (2006), examined the effect of chronic exposure to cipro on stream microbial community level physiological profiles (CLPP) and growth indices of detritovorous amphipods and caddisflies. Reduced respiration in leaf-associated microbial communities was observed for samples exposed to 100 J..Lg/L over 12 days. However, no effects were observed at a concentration of 1.0 J..Lg/L or 10 J..Lg/L and no effects were observed on detritovores. These results suggest that cipro may affect leaf-associated microbial communities but other factors such as adsorption and microbial redundancy prevented detection of any effects on detritovore processing of leaf material. The authors did not attempt to account for concentrations of cipro adsorbed to organic matter and concluded that future research should evaluate the implications of cipro partitioning to organic material as well as more sensitive stream microbes and microbially mediated ecosystem processes such as nitrogen cycling.

1.1.11 Effects on Nitrification

FQs have a broad spectrum of activity and are, therefore, likely to affect the entire sludge bacterial community including gram-negative bacteria responsible for nitrification. This may result in a shift in microbial population which in tum may affect the activity of the sludge such as a reduction in nitrification capacity. Nitrification is an important process in nitrogen biogeochemistry that seems to be controlled in many environments by relatively few species of slow-growing chemoautotrophic bacteria. However, there is growing awareness of the important role archaea play in nitrification in some environments, notably marine and soil habitats (Francis et al., 2007). Archaea use various reductive pathways, both assimilatory (nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation) and dissimilatory (nitrate respiration and denitrification). However, these processes are less well known than the prokaryotic processes of nitrogen metabolism (Cabello et al., 2004). Furthermore, there is very little understanding of the role of archaea in freshwater sediment nitrification, or of the sensitivity of these archaea to environmental stressors, and the generalized sensitivity of nitrification to environmental stressors may have a different root cause than the historic explanation of low bacterial diversity and functional redundancy. The low diversity makes this group of organisms, and hence the process of nitrification, particularly vulnerable to toxic chemicals.

Hailing-Sorensen (200 1) investigated the toxicity of antibacterial agents on environmentally relevant bacteria using activated sludge, specifically inhibitory effects on growth and nitrification. The effects of ten antibacterial compounds including oxolinic acid on growth inhibition and nitrification were assessed. In general, antibacterials with a broad spectrum of activity were more potent than narrow-spectrum antibacterials. Growth inhibition of activated sludge bacteria was assessed over 4 to 6 hours using a standardized ISO test and also using the pour plate method over 48 hours. EC 50 for oxolinic acid was 0.1 mg/L and 0.064 mg/L, respectively. The effect of oxolinic acid on the nitrification rate of activated sludge bacteria was also assessed and oxolinic acid was found to stimulate nitrification. However, when growth inhibition of Nitrosomonas europeae was studied using the pour-plate method, the EC 50 value was 1.0 mg/L (Hailing-Sorensen, 2001).

Page 29

The author was unable to account for the increased sensitivity during the pour-plate tests or for the stimulatory effect of oxolinic acid on nitrification. An additional challenge was the difficulty assessing nitrification inhibition rates. Finally, the author was not able to explain why the EC 50 values for growth inhibition using N europaea were higher for most compounds including oxolinic acid compared to the values for activated sludge bacteria growth inhibition.

The author concluded that the EC 50 values were in the 11g/L range for most compounds and that more work should be done to assess the effects on nitrogen cycling because of the difficulties associated with available methods.

Inhibition of denitrification by FQ in marine environments

Costanzo et al. (2005), evaluated the effects of short-term exposure to antibiotics, including cipro and norfloxacin, on denitrification rates in sewage effluent and downstream from a sewage discharge in Brisbane, Australia. The results of the study indicated no significant difference between treatments and control. However, this may be explained by the effect of seawater cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) inhibiting the action of cipro, and suggests a need to test the effects of FQs on denitrification in freshwater.

1.1.12 Summary of FQs the Environment

FQs are synthetic antibiotics and are structurally variable within their class. They are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and are approved for both human and veterinary use. FQs are generally only partially metabolized and enter the environment through waste water, application ofbiosolids and through direct application to surface waters during aquaculture. FQs have been measured in surface water, sediments and soils. Fate mechanisms are dominated by photodegradation and partitioning to organic matter. FQ antibiotics are rapidly degraded in surface water by UV light but are insensitive to hydrolysis and temperature. FQs partition to organic matter, both within the water column and in sediments. This results in a

Page 30

short half-life in water but persistence in sediments. Therefore, they may affect microbial populations in sediments.

Environmental effects of FQs include acute and chronic toxicity, possible alterations of energy cycling and resulting food chain effects and antimicrobial resistance. Based on the usage, environmental occurrence and toxicity of FQs, there are a number of knowledge gaps which, if addressed, would improve our understanding of FQ behaviour and effects in the environment. Few studies have assessed the effects of FQs on benthic organisms or entire benthic microbial communities at environmentally relevant concentrations. Effects on ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling are not well understood. Although standardized tests are generally not long enough or sensitive enough to capture effects on less numerous microbial populations such as nitrifying microorganisms, reliable non-standardized methodologies have not been developed.

1.2

The Nitrogen Cycle

The nitrogen cycle is a complex biogeochemical cycle comprising terrestrial, atmospheric and aquatic components. Nitrogen is an essential element found in amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids and chlorophyll. The earth's atmosphere is comprised of approximately 78 % nitrogen gas (N2), of which approximately 99.636% is in the form of the the form of the
15
14

N isotope and 0.364% is in

N isotope (De Laeter et al., 2003 ). Plants, algae and bacteria can take up

inorganic nitrogen as either nitrate (N0 3) or ammonium (NH4+). However, few processes convert molecular nitrogen (N2 ) to inorganic nitrogen because it is relatively unreactive due to a thermodynamically stable triple bond (N=N) (Madigan et al., 2000).

Although abundant in the atmosphere, nitrogen is often a limiting nutrient for plant growth. Very few organisms can cycle nitrogen through its inorganic forms (N03-, N0 2 -, NH 3, NH4+). Most inorganic nitrogen is biochemically cycled by specialized microorganisms (Bianchi, 2007). Humans, like all multicellular animals, obtain nitrogen only from dietary sources so the environmental stability of primary producers is essential to human survival. An environmental

Page 31

stressor such as an antibiotic targeting prokaryotic organisms could alter or uncouple nitrogen cycling processes in local environments, affecting the processing and availability of nitrogen to eukaryotic organisms.

1.2.1

Nitrogen Cycle Processes

The five main processes which make up the nitrogen cycle are nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, assimilation and nitrogen fixation (Figure 1-1 ). Mineralization is the production of inorganic nitrogen from organic nitrogen and includes ammonification. Immobilization is the reverse; the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen to organic nitrogen forms and includes uptake, assimilation and denitrification. While other processes such as anammox are important in some habitats, the five highlighted processes represent the most important in terms of energy and material (N) flow through aquatic ecosystems. This series of experiments was designed to assess what, if any, effects cipro has on each of three of the processes in the nitrogen cycle: nitrification, denitrification and ammonification (mineralization)/DNRA. Respiration is the oxidation of organic matter to produce energy and, although not part of the nitrogen cycle, directly affects nitrification and denitrification as a result of 0 2 distribution and inorganic nitrogen availability. Also, because most of ammonification comprises mineralization of organic compounds to ammonia, respiration was used as a proxy measure for ammonification.

Nitrification is the microbially mediated oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrifying bacteria are virtually ubiquitous in soil and water and may be especially abundant in ammoniarich environments such as surface waters downstream from sewage treatment facilities (Madigan et al., 2000).

Page 33

Nitrification occurs in a two step process (ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation):

NH4 + + 3/2 (02) --+ N02- + H20 + 2H+, ~Go= - 290 kJ/mol N02- + 112 (02) --+ N03-,
~Go=-

89 kJ/mol (Bianchi, 2007)

Nitrifying bacteria consume oxygen and oxidize NH4+ generated by the decomposition of organic matter (mineralization of organic nitrogen-containing compounds) to produce N02 and N0 3. Nitrification in aquatic sediments is associated with a small and phylogenetically constrained group of bacteria (Ward, 2007). Nitrifying bacteria comprise two separate groups of predominantly gram-negative organisms: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nitrosifyers

(Nitrosomonas, Nitrosococcus, Nitrosospira, Nitrosolobus and Nitrosovibrio) and nitriteoxidizing bacteria (Nitrobacter, Nitrospina, Nitrococcus and Nitrospira). Most nitrifying bacteria are obligate aerobic chemolithotrophs (autotrophs) which derive energy solely from the oxidation of reduced inorganic nitrogen compounds (ammonium and nitrite) and use C0 2 as their carbon source to create organic compounds (Madigan et al., 2000; Jaffe, 1992). More specifically, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are considered to be strictly autotrophic while nitriteoxidizing bacteria have limited heterotrophic potential (Ward, 2007).

Nitrification is oxygen-dependent and typically occurs in circulating or flowing surface waters and near-surface soils and sediments. The activity of these nitrifying bacteria in sediments is particularly sensitive to the absence of dissolved oxygen (Bianchi, 2007). Nitrification is therefore also dependent on light which stimulates photosynthesis and diffusion processes which affect 0 2 distribution (Risgaard-Petersen et al., 1994).

Page 34

·

Denitrification

The process of nitrate or nitrite reduction to nitrogen gas (N2 , NO or N 2 0) returns nitrogen to the atmosphere and is known as denitrification or dissimilatory reduction of nitrate or nitrite. Denitrifying bacteria (e.g., Thiobacillus denitrificans, Paracoccus denitrificans, Pseudomonas

denitrificans) are predominantly gram-negative, facultative anaerobes which derive energy from
the anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds, (Jaffe, 1992) using nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor to oxygen during respiration.

(Bianchi, 2007) When oxygen is present, aerobic respiration will occur even if nitrate is available. Conventional denitrification ability is widespread in bacteria (Ward, 2007). Some denitrifying bacteria will also reduce other electron acceptors (iron, manganese, sulphate, sulphide) and can also grow by fermentation (methanogenesis). Denitrifiers are a very phylogenetically diverse group of organisms. There are 17 genera of facultative anaerobic bacteria which can utilize nitrate as an oxidizing agent (Jaffe, 2000). Therefore, denitrifying bacteria are metabolically diverse with respect to generating energy (Madigan et al., 2000) and this diversity may offer reduced sensitivity to chemicals.

Denitrification in surface waters can be supported by nitrate supplied either by diffusion from overlying water (direct denitrification) or by nitrification in the sediments (coupled denitrification) (Rysgaard et al., 1994). Sediments are often an important source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen for denitrification (Soonmo, Gardner and Kana, 2001 ). Other factors responsible for regulating denitrification rates are temperature (Davidson and Seitzinger, 2006), 0 2 consumption in sediments (Seitzinger, 1988 and 1990), external nitrogen inputs, mineralization of organic matter and other bacterial processes occurring under anoxic conditions such as sulphate reduction or methanogenesis (Seitzinger, 1988).

Page 35

Anammox (anaerobic ammonia oxidation), the oxidation of ammonia coupled to nitrate reduction, yields N 2 . The mechanism is unknown but is thought to be common in wastewater and oxygen-depleted zones (Groffman, 2006).

The ecological significance of denitrification is that it (along with anammox) represents the only permanent sink in the nitrogen cycle by converting N into a form that cannot be used by most other organisms. In some habitats denitrification can ameliorate excess N loading (Seitzinger and Nixon, 1985) and is ultimately responsible for N-limitation of primary producers in a variety of habitats.

Dissimilatory Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonium (DNRA)

Dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA) is the reduction ofN0 3- to NH4 +rather than nitrogen gas (Fennel et al., 2009). DNRA results in conservation of nitrogen in bioavailable form as opposed to denitrification which is a sink for nitrogen. The significance of DNRA in aquatic sediments is still not clear (Binnerup et al., 1992). An and Gardner (2002) measured DNRA using MIMS and HPLC in a shallow estuary in Texas and reported that DNRA consumed 15 to 75% of added 15N0 3- compared to only 5 to 29% for denitrification. It is thought that high organic carbon content relative to nitrate concentrations favours DNRA over denitrification but there is little information about the competition between organisms response for DNRA compared to denitrification (Canavan et al., 2007). Christensen et al., (2000) studied denitrification and DNRA in sediments below marine fish farms in Denmark and reported DNRA activity 4 to 6 times greater than denitrification activity below the fish cages (7 J..Lmol N/m /d) when nitrate concentrations were 13 J..LM. High sulfide concentrations which inhibit denitrification may result in increased DNRA as available N0 3 - which is not consumed by denitrification is available to be consumed by DNRA. Sulfide may also act as an electron donor for DNRA (An and Gardner, 2002).

Ammonification/mineralization

Ammonification is the process where organic nitrogen is returned to the environment in the form of ammonia by decomposition of organic matter (also called N mineralization) mediated by heterotrophic bacteria or via excretion of organic matter from animals. Decomposition of organic matter is the only major source of reduced nitrogen other than nitrogen fixation. Bacteria, primarily heterotrophs, which remineralize organic matter as a carbon source leave behind ammonia which is then recycled by other organisms. Ammonification can occur in sediments or in the water column (Bianchi, 2007). Ammonifying bacteria are a diverse group of heterotrophic generalist organisms and may be anaerobic, aerobic or facultative with respect to 0 2 respiration (Ward, 1996a). Ammonification occurs in oxic and anoxic conditions but ammonium generally does not accumulate because of nitrification and assimilation. Nitrification and ammonification may be tightly coupled in the photic zone of surface waters especially in the open ocean where material that is degraded is rapidly ammonified and nitrified. Nitrification and ammonification may become uncoupled in oxygen-depleted zones where lack of oxygen inhibits nitrification (Ward, 1996a). Ammonification is a very important process in the transformation and recycling of a limiting nutrient from complex organic compounds back to the dissolved inorganic nutrient pool.

Assimilation

Inorganic nitrogen compounds such as NH 3 or NH4+ can be oxidized to N0 2- or N0 3- or they can be taken up and used by organisms in the formation of proteins and other essential compounds (organic nitrogen). This is referred to as ammonia assimilation. Converting inorganic nitrogen to organic nitrogen makes nitrogen available to ecosystem food chains (Madigan et al., 2000). Since plants generally obtain most nitrogen from nitrate via reductive assimilation, direct ammonia assimilation provides a significant competitive advantage with respect to energy saving (Jaffe, 2000). Nitrate may also be simultaneously reduced and assimilated. This process is referred to as assimilatory nitrate reduction and is likely to be a dominant process when reduced nitrogen is limited such as during aerobic conditions (Jaffe, 2000).

Page 37

Nitrogen fixation

N2 to NH3 (reduction)

Biological nitrogen fixation is the biologically-mediated process of reducing atmospheric N 2 gas to NH 3 , NH4+ or any organic N compound in the presence of nitrogenase enzyme (Madigan et al. 2000; Jaffe, 2000). Nitrogen is fixed by a phylogenetically and physiologically diverse array of highly specialized microorganisms including bacteria, cyanobacteria, actinomycetes and archaea (Ward, 2007). This inorganic nitrogen can then be used by terrestrial plants or marine algae. Atmospheric N 2 fixation can also occur during lightning strikes. However, this is thought to comprise less than 10% of total global N fixation. Industrial fixation occurs during fertilizer production but most ammonia is further processed to urea and ammonium nitrate. Industrial processes such as nitrogen fertilizer production, increased planting of leguminous crops and combustion of fossil fuels, almost doubles the rate of naturally occurring (i.e. biological and atmospheric) total global nitrogen fixation (Ayers et al., 1994). Nitrogen fixation was beyond the scope of this study as water contaminated by high levels of cipro (such as from WWTP effluent and perhaps feed-lot runoff) is expected to also have high loading of fixed nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen fixation is expected to be negligible. Inhibition of nitrogen fixation by cipro might then be significant statistically but environmentally irrelevant.

Summary of the Nitrogen Cycle

Nitrification is generally considered more sensitive to environmental stressors due to the low diversity of nitrifying obligate autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing and nitrite-oxidizing (some limited heterotrophic potential) bacteria. Given that nitrification is carried out by relatively small clades of closely related microbes, while other processes are carried out by large, diverse groups of microorganisms, nitrification may be the "weak link" in the nitrogen cycle and more vulnerable to the effects of environmental stressors like toxic chemicals. Denitrification and ammonification are often less sensitive than nitrification as result of the diversity of facultative heterotrophic organisms responsible for these processes.

1.2.2

Nitrogen Cycling In Aquatic Sediments

In aquatic sediments, nitrogen occurs mainly in organic form with a small fraction occurring as

ammonia (NH 3). Typically NH 3 is formed by autolysis or mineralization by bacteria of organic matter. Ammonia is then dissolved in interstitial water or adsorbed by colloids within the sediments (Bianchi, 2007). In oxygenated environments, autotrophic bacteria convert ammonium into nitrate (nitrification). Under reducing conditions, denitrification is likely to occur. Nitrification and denitrification often occur in close proximity, often at the boundary between oxic and anoxic layers which usually occurs near the sediment-water interface. A substantial part of the N0 3- formed b~nitrification afterwards diffuses to the anaerobic denitrification zone where it is reduced to N 2 (Nielsen et al., 1992). Nitrogen cycling processes in aquatic sediments are therefore dependent on dissolved oxygen concentrations, specifically the depth distribution of dissolved oxygen (Rysgaard et al., 1994).

Other factors contributing to exchange of nitrogen between sediments and surface water are: oxygen distribution, sulphide content and redox status of the sediments (An and Gardner, 2002) and the overlying water column and reduced microzones in aerobic zones within the sediments (Jenkins and Kemp, 1984); sorption/desorption processes such as cation exchange (Matson and Vitousek, 1987); microbial respiration (Smith et al., 2006); excretion by benthic organisms (Henriksen et al., 1981) and, depositional flux of nitrate, ammonium and organic matter to sediments (Cowan et al., 1996).

1.2.2.1 Direct Denitrification

Oxygen affects the flux of nitrogen across the sediment-water interface. Diffusive gradients may cause N0 3- formed by nitrification in surface waters to flow downwards to sediments and be consumed by denitrification at the oxic-anoxic interface. The direction of the gradient determines the direction of nitrate diffusion (Jorgensen and Boudreau, 2001 ).

Page 39

When nitrate concentrations in the surface water are high, the main source of nitrate for sediment denitrification is diffusion from above. Under conditions of low oxygen, the oxic zone is thin so diffusion of nitrate is rapid. Nitrate fluxes are high and subsequently, denitrification rates are also high. This is referred to as direct denitrification (Fennel et al., 2009). However, under high oxygen conditions, the oxic zone is relatively thicker so diffusion of nitrate from above is slow. Therefore, nitrate fluxes are low and denitrification rates become more closely tied to sediment nitrification (Jorgensen and Boudreau, 2001).

When nitrate concentrations in the surface water are low, the main source of nitrate for denitrification is nitrification occurring in the oxic layer. Under low oxygen conditions, nitrification rates decrease causing sediments to lose ammonium to the water column and denitrification rates also drop. Under high oxygen conditions, nitrification increases so denitrification rates are relatively higher (Jorgensen and Boudreau, 2001).

1.2.2.2 Coupled Nitrification-Denitrification

When organic material is deposited, nitrogen becomes buried in the sediments with the organic matter. Anaerobic degradation causes release of dissolved organic nitrogen and ammonium. NH4+ formed during anaerobic degradation of organic matter may either flow into overlying surface water to support nitrification or be retained in sediments. Sedimentary nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by interactions between oxygen and nitrogen metabolism. When the NH4+ arrives in the oxic zone, NH4+is either lost to the surface water or nitrification occurs (Jorgensen and Boudreau, 2001 ). Coupling between nitrification and denitrification occurs when nitrification products (N0 2-, N0 3-) are transported across the redox boundary (Bianchi, 2007).

When organic matter deposition increases, ammonium from remineralization also increases. Coupled nitrification-denitrification can increase in response. However, when organic matter deposition is very high, oxygen consumption due to aerobic degradation of this material can greatly restrict the oxic layer. As the oxic layer becomes thinner, nitrification decreases and

Page 40

coupled denitrification can also decrease as a result (Jorgensen and Boudreau, 2001). Rysgaard et al. (1994) reported that total denitrification would decrease under high 0 2 conditions because direct denitrification would decrease but coupled denitrification would be stimulated except when nitrate concentrations in overlying water are low (direct denitrification decreases less than the increase in coupled denitrification). Coupled nitrification-denitrification is therefore also
indire~tly

dependent on oxygen uptake during respiration and mineralization of

organic matter (Seitzinger, 1990).

Risgaard-Petersen et al. (1994) measured the effect of light penetration, and therefore photosynthesis, on nitrification and denitrification in sediment from a Scandinavian fjord and reported increased oxygen penetration into sediments which stimulated nitrification resulting in an increased rate of nitrate release during illumination. This also caused an increased in coupled denitrification and reduced the rate of denitrification of nitrate supplied from the water column. However, coupled denitrification represented a small fraction
(~14%)

of total denitrification.

Smith et al. (2006) measured direct and coupled-denitrification rates in the benthic sediments of two rivers within the upper Mississippi River basin that received variably high nitrate runoff from agricultural sources and concluded that coupled nitrification-denitrification was not a significant source ofN2 production. Overall, denitrification rates were positively correlated with nitrate concentration but not with sediment oxygen demand.

In general, heterotrophic bacteria have a much higher affinity for 0 2 and are likely to

out-compete nitrifying bacteria under low 02 conditions (Blackburn, 1990).

1.2.3

Anthropogenic Influences on Nitrogen Cycling

Anthropogenic activities which affect global nitrogen cycling include agricultural runoff (increased denitrification and leaching of nitrates into surface and groundwater), wastewater treatment effluent, landfill leachate, draining of wetlands and fossil fuel combustion (release of solid nitrogen as NOx, N 2 0 to the atmosphere). Galloway (1998) estimates that anthropogenic

Page 41

activities including energy production, fertilizer production and cultivation of crops fixes approximately the same quantity of nitrogen (90-130 Tg N/year).
(~150

Tg N/year) as biological fixation

Anthropogenic contaminants have been shown to affect nitrogen cycling processes, of which nitrification appears to be the most sensitive process. Atrazine, a widely-used synthetic herbicide, significantly altered N-cycling rates in stream sediments at a concentrations as low as 10 Jlg/L (Laursen and Carlton, 1999). At 10 Jlg/L, aerobic respiration (and, therefore, ammonification) was stimulated, reducing the thickness of the oxic zone. Nitrification and denitrification were also stimulated, possibly due to enhanced supply of ammonium to nitrifiers and coupling of nitrification and denitrification. Stimulation of aerobic respiration continued at atrazine concentrations up to 100 Jlg/L; however, nitrification and denitrification were inhibited at atrazine concentrations of 50 and 100 Jlg/L, respectively. Paraquat, another widely-used herbicide, completely inhibited both ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation for 40 days at concentrations as low as 1 mg/L. However, atrazine inhibited only ammonium oxidation at concentrations ranging from 5 to 10 mg/L for 40 days (Gadkari, 1988).

Trace metals have an effect on microorganisms especially nitrifying bacteria. Zinc concentrations ranging from 500 Jlg/L to 10 mg/L had an inhibitory effect on nitrate production and led to increased ammonium in sediments. Low levels of copper (1 Jlg/L) have a slight inhibitory effect on nitrification over a 24 hour period (Allanson and Baird, 1999). Free nickel and cadmium cations inhibit ammonium oxidation but not nitrite oxidation at concentrations of approximately 1 mmol/L (Hu et al., 2002).

The studies above, considered together, suggest that nitrification is generally more sensitive to a variety of chemical stressors than other nitrogen cycling processes. Similarly, cipro in freshwater sediments might be expected to have a greater impact on nitrification than on denitrification or ammonification, particularly if nitrification in freshwater sediments is dominated by bacteria. However, there is very little research on the impacts of antibacterial agents on N-cycling

Page 42

processes in natural aquatic systems. It is important to determine the potential ecological impacts of contaminants such as cipro because aquatic ecosystems are complex and provide valuable ecological services. These services include amelioration of eutrophication by removal of excess nitrogen (denitrification), detoxification of ammonium through oxidation, and production of organic carbon that serves as the base of the food web through N -assimilation and nitrification.

1.3.1

Hypothesis and Rationale
Hypothesis

Given that ciprofloxacin is microbially active and was designed to have specifically detrimental physiological effects on pathogenic bacteria, it is reasonable to infer that cipro may also adversely affect environmental bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling processes. The purpose of these experiments was to assess what, if any, effect ciprofloxacin has on nitrogen cycling processes, specifically nitrification, denitrification and ammonification (mineralisation), in a simple microcosm consisting of lake sediment and surface water. Since the bacteria responsible for nitrification are less diverse and more specialized than bacteria carrying out other nitrogen cycling processes, the impact of ciprofloxacin is anticipated to be most significant on nitrification rates relative to denitrification and ammonification; microbial processes which are generally considered less sensitive to the effects of environmental stressors. Given that these processes are linked, an effect on one process would eventually be reflected in the other nitrogen cycling processes. By assessing the effects of various cipro concentrations on production of nitrogen species (including nitrate, ammonium and N 2) relative to reference microcosms, it may be possible to predict the effect of cipro on each of these processes.

Page 43

1.3.2

Experimental Design and Rationale

Four processes were studied over the course of four experiments. The specific objective was to assess the impact of cipro on nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, and respiration.

Experiment 1: Effect of cipro on nitrate and ammonium fluxes

In experiment 1, sediment was spiked with various concentrations of cipro and the overlying

water was amended with excess ammonium and then nitrate. Measurements of ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the overlying water provided an indication on the effect of cipro on nitrate and ammonium fluxes. The addition of excess ammonium or nitrate to surface water was intended to saturate ammonium oxidizers and denitrifiers, respectively. The purpose of this experiment was to analyse the concentrations of both ammonium and nitrate over time in the overlying surface water following a spike with each compound and calculate rates of flux of ammonium and nitrate.

Experiment 2: Effect of cipro on nitrification and DNRA using

15

N stable isotope methods

The objective of this experiment was to directly study the effect of cipro on nitrification and ammonification. In addition to measurements of nitrate and ammonium fluxes, rates of nitrification and ammonification were measured directly using the
15

N stable isotope

microdiffusion method to study changes in isotopic composition of the nitrate and ammonium pool (Nielsen, 1992). This method, referred to as isotope dilution, provides a measure of nitrification where nitrate is released to overlying water (Jensen et al., 1996). In this method, the
15 14

N label in the nitrate pool becomes diluted as more nitrate is produced from

N ammonium.

This method differs from the isotope pairing method which is used to measure denitrification. In the isotope pairing method, individual N isotopes "pair" to form the dinitrogen (N 2 ) molecule. Both isotope pairing and isotope dilution can be measured in the same experiment by addition of
15

N0 3- (Experiments 3 and 4); the two methods, dilution and pairing, specifically measure

nitrification and denitrification, respectively.

Page 44

Experiment 3: Effect of cipro on denitrification under low nitrate conditions using MIMS

The objective of this experiment was to study the effect of cipro on denitrification and respiration in a nitrate limited environment. In addition to measurements of nitrate and ammonium fluxes, rates of denitrification and respiration were measured directly based on changes in N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar using membrane-inlet mass spectroscopy (MIMS).

N 2 production is normally difficult to quantify due to the high background concentrations ofN2 in the environment (Groffman et al., 2006). Accurate measurement of small changes in dissolved N 2 concentrations can be measured with a high level of precision using MIMS (Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002). This technique has become popular for studying denitrification because it provides rapid measurements on small samples with no pre-processing and provides high precision (0.03% for N 2 :Ar ratios) (Kana et a1.,1994; Groffman et al., 2006).

This methodology allowed measurement of rates of denitrification, respiration and percent contribution by diffusion (% Diff). Membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) was used to determine the rate of denitrification for each treatment by calculating the rate of increase ofN2 relative to argon gas (Ar). MIMS was used to quantify changes in the ratios of dissolved N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar within the overlying water. By controlling the ratio of 15N to
14

N in the microcosms,

it was also possible to estimate the rate of denitrification ofN0 3- in the water column and also quantify coupled nitrification-denitrification.

The acetylene inhibition method of measuring denitrification rates (Stewart et al., 1967) was ruled out because acetylene selectively inhibits autotrophic nitrification without inhibiting heterotrophic nitrification (Knowles, 1990). As a result, the acetylene inhibition method has been shown to underestimate coupled denitrification, up to 25% in one study, which would defeat the objectives of this study (Steingruber et al., 2001).

Page 45

Experiment 4: Effect of cipro on denitrification under non-limiting nitrate conditions using MIMS

The objective of this experiment was to study the effect of cipro on denitrification and respiration when nitrate is not limiting. Rates of denitrification and respiration were measured directly based on changes in N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar using MIMS, as described above.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiment 1 - Net Flux of Ammonium and Nitrate under substratesaturating conditions

2.1

Experiment 1 was conducted in two halves.

Potential Net Nitrification: The first half of the experiment consisted of spiking the overlying surface water in each of the microcosms with 70.6
~mol/L

(1 mg/L) ammonium. Samples of

the overlying water were collected and analyzed for ammonium (ammonium flux into/out of sediments) and nitrate concentrations (nitrate flux into/out of sediments).

Potential Net Ammonification: The second half of the experiment consisted of spiking the overlying surface water in each of the microcosms with 70.6
~mol/L

(1 mg/L) nitrate. Samples

of the overlying water were collected and analyzed for nitrate (nitrate flux into/out of sediments) and ammonium concentrations (ammonium flux into/out of sediments).

The overlying water was sampled at intervals over a period of24 hours. All samples were analyzed for NH4+ and N 0 3- to assess both N 0 3- flux into/out of sediments and NH4 + flux into/out of sediments. Rates were calculated for each microcosm and averaged for each treatment. Rates of flux were calculated as micromoles of nitrogen per square metre per hour
(~mol N/m /h).
2

Microcosm Set Up

Six microcosms were set up for the purpose of this experiment. Each microcosm consisted of a 500 mL glass jar with lid, approximately 20 g of sediment and approximately 450 mL of dechlorinated tap water. The microcosms were set up in the dark to prevent photodegradation of cipro from occurring during sediment amendment.

Page 47

Three reference microcosms were not treated with cipro. Golet et al. (2003) reported cipro concentrations of 3.1 mglkg in sewage sludge from a Swiss WWTP so this value was considered the theoretical upward limit of environmentally relevant concentrations for the cipro doses used in these experiments. The concentration of cipro in the three treated microcosms was approximately 2 mg cipro per kg of sediment. 5 mL of dissolved cipro solution was added to each of the three microcosms and allowed to equilibrate overnight. On June 7, 2007, dechlorinated tap water amended with 70.6 JlmoliL ammonium (1 mg NIL as ammonium chloride) was added to all of the microcosms. A 15 mL sample of this water was collected in a polyethylene centrifuge tube prior to addition into the microcosms to measure initial nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Samples of the overlying water (15 mL) from each microcosm were then collected and filtered (Whatman GFIF filter, nominal pore size 0.7 Jlm) at the following time intervals: 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 8.5 and 21.5 hours. These samples were labelled and frozen at -20°C pending analysis.

The overlying water was then siphoned off carefully using a syringe so as to avoid sediment resuspension. Subsequently, dechlorinated tap water amended with 70.6 Jlmol/L (1 mg NIL as sodium nitrate) was then added to all of the microcosms. A sample of this water was collected prior to addition into the microcosms. Samples from the overlying water from each microcosm were then collected using 50 mL polyethylene syringes and filtered (as above) at the following five time intervals over a 24 hour period: 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 8 and 21 hours. These samples were labelled and frozen (-20°C) pending analysis.

The procedure for ammonium and nitrate analysis is described in Section 4.5 below.

The flux was calculated as the slope of a linear regression on dissolved nutrient concentration versus time (i.e. micromoles of nitrogen per square metre per hour (Jlmol N/m21h)). Rates were calculated for each microcosm and averaged for each treatment.

Page 48

2.2

Experiment 2- Nitrification using

15

N microdiffusion and nutrient fluxes

Nitrification and ammonification were measured directly using the 15N stable isotope microdiffusion method described in Section 4.6.

Microcosm Set Up

Thirty microcosms were set up for the purpose of this experiment. Each microcosm consisted of a 500 mL glass jar with lid, approximately 20 g of sediment and approximately 450 mL of synthetic lake water (Ivorra et al., 1995) with 10% (atomic%) of the nitrate as concentration ofN as N0 3 - in the synthetic lake water was 70.6
~mol/L
15

N0 3-. The total

(equivalent to

1 mg NIL). The composition of synthetic lake water is described in Section 2.8. All
30 microcosms were set up in the dark to prevent photodegradation of cipro from occurring

during sediment amendment.

This experiment consisted of five replicates of six treatments: Reference- 0 mg/kg cipro; Treatment 1 - 0.5 mg/kg cipro; Treatment 2 - 1.0 mg/kg cipro; Treatment 3 - 1.5 mg/kg cipro; Treatment 4-2. 0 mg/kg cipro; Treatment 5-2.5 mg/kg cipro.'

Twenty-five of the thirty microcosms were treated with 1 mL of ethanol and cipro solution and allowed to equilibrate for one hour (reference microcosms were not treated). The use of ethanol as a carrier for cipro is discussed in Section 2.9. The overlying water was decanted from each microcosm prior to treatment with cipro solution and fresh synthetic lake water was added approximately one hour after treatment. An aliquot of the synthetic lake water was collected prior to addition into the microcosms. Samples of the overlying water (5 mL for nitrate analysis, 10 mL for ammonium analysis and 100 mL for 15N microdiffusion analysis) from each microcosm were then collected and filtered at the following two time points: 8 hours and 24 hours. In addition, 15 mL of sample were collected after 16 hours for nutrient analysis (5 mL for nitrate analysis, 10 mL for ammonium analysis). The decision to reduce the number of time

Page 49

points analyzed was based on the linearity of changes in dissolved inorganic N species between 8 and 24 hours in the first experiment.

2.3

Experiment 3 - Denitrification under low nitrate conditions

Experiment 3 consisted of two parts: nutrient flux measurements and direct measurements of denitrification, percent contribution by diffusion (%Diff) and respiration based on changes in N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar using MIMS.

Microcosm Set Up

Sixty microcosms were set up for the purpose of this experiment. Each microcosm consisted of a 300 mL BOD bottle with stopper, approximately 20 g of sediment and approximately 300 mL of synthetic lake water (as described in Experiment 2). BOD bottles instead of jars were used to prevent loss of dissolved gases (N2 , 0 2 and Ar) from the microcosms. The difference in volume was accounted for in rate calculations. The total concentration ofN as N0 3 - in the synthetic lake water was 7 Jlmol/L (equivalent to 0.1 mg N0 3 -/L). This concentration of nitrate approximates a lake in summer when nutrients have been depleted (Jensen et al., 1996). All microcosms were set up in the dark to prevent photodegradation of cipro from occurring during sediment amendment.

This experiment consisted of five replicates of six treatments: Reference (0 mg/kg cipro ); Treatment 1 (0.5 mg/kg cipro); Treatment 2 (1.0 mg/kg cipro ); Treatment 3 (1.5 mg/kg cipro ); Treatment 4 (2. 0 mg/kg cipro) and Treatment 5 (2.5 mg/kg cipro ).

Page 50

Two sets of BOD bottles for a total of sixty microcosms (one BOD bottle for each time interval) were required in order to collect samples for N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar analysis. Fifty of the sixty

microcosms (excluding reference microcosms) were treated with 1 mL of ethanol and cipro solution and allowed to equilibrate for one hour. Approximately 300 mL of synthetic lake water was added to each of the 60 microcosms. An aliquot of the synthetic lake water was collected prior to addition into the microcosms.

Samples of the overlying water (15 mL for nitrate analysis, 10 mL for ammonium analysis and 5 mL for N 2:Ar and 0 2:Ar analysis) from each microcosm were collected at the following time intervals: 8 hours and 24 hours. Samples for nitrate and ammonium analysis were filtered into centrifuge sample tubes. Water samples for N2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar analysis were not filtered but collected in glass vials with Teflon septa by gravity siphoning using flexible plastic tubing from the neck of each BOD bottle. Approximately 500 J.!L of saturated ZnCh preservative solution was added to the vial immediately prior to sample collection. Samples for nitrate and ammonium analysis were immediately frozen. Samples for N2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar analysis using MIMS were stored submerged in deionized water at 4°C. The analytical method is discussed further in Section 2. 7.

In addition to the microcosms set up as part of the experimental design, three microcosms were

set up but were not treated with cipro in order to assess initial 15N signature in the sediment. The three untreated microcosms used to assess initial 15N signature in the sediment were shaken up to create a slurry of sediment and water. Once the slurry had settled, a sample of the overlying water was collected and analyzed using the method described in Section 2.7.

Three method blanks were also set up to assess the NH4+ content of the reagents used in the sample preparation process. A total of 122 water samples (including two method blanks) were collected for ammonium and nitrate analysis and 66 for N2:Ar and 0 2:Ar analysis (including two method blanks and three for 15N signature).

Page 51

2.4

Experiment 4 - Denitrification under non-limiting nitrate conditions

In Experiment 4, direct measurements of denitrification, percent contribution by diffusion (%Diff) and respiration were calculated based on changes in N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar using MIMS. Nutrient fluxes were not assessed.

Microcosm Set Up

The set up for Experiment 4 was repeated with a total concentration ofN0 3- in the synthetic lake water of70.6 J..Lmol/L (equivalent to 1 mg NIL). A 5 mL sample was collected for N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar analysis from each microcosm were collected at the following time intervals: 8 hours and 24 hours. Water samples for N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar analysis were not filtered but collected in glass vials with Teflon septa by gravity siphoning using flexible plastic tubing from the neck of each BOD bottle. Approximately 200 J.!L ZnCh preservative solution (saturated) was added to the vial immediately prior to sample collection. Samples for N 2-Ar analysis were stored submerged in deionized water at 4°C. The microcosms were discarded following sample collection. A total of 65 water samples were collected for N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar analysis.

2.5

Ammonium and Nitrate Analysis

Nitrate and ammonium concentrations were measured using methods adapted from the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (American Public Health Association, 1998). Dissolved nitrogen species were quantified colorimetrically. Ammonium was measured using the phenate method (APHA method 4500-NH3 F Phenate method) and nitrate by cadium reduction to nitrite (APHA method 4500-N0 3- E Cadmium reduction method). A summary of the method and deviations from the method are provided in Appendix 1.

Page 52

Net fluxes of ammonium and nitrate were calculated by converting measured values of mg/L to micromoles N per m 2 per hour (J.!mollm2/h) by multiplying measured rates by total water volume in the microcosm and dividing by sediment surface area using the equation:

Flux = (Final concentration- Initial Concentration) x Volume I Area

2.6

N Stable Isotope Microdiffusion

The stable N isotope dilution method was used to study nitrification and coupled denitrification occurring at the sediment-water boundary. The sample preparation method was adapted from Eyre et al. (2002) using methodology provided by Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory (CPSIL) (Appendix 1).

Nitrification rates were determined using 15N microdiffusion technique adapted from Eyre et al. (2002). The methodological theory is that addition of magnesium oxide (MgO) makes the water sample alkaline and NH4+ is converted to NH 3 . The ammonium gas is captured and bound to an acidified GF/F filter (converting it back to ammonium) inside a diffusion packet. The filter is then rolled into a silver capsule which is combusted by an elemental analyser with an inline isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) and peaks measured for ratio of 14N: 15N.

In order to measure nitrate concentrations, Devarda's alloy was added which acts as an electron donor. N0 3- is reduced to NH4+ which is captured on the filter and measured in the same way.

2.6.1

Preparation of Diffusion Packets

Diffusion packets were prepared using a procedure provided by Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory (CPSIL). Two filters were punched out from each GF/F filter using a 12 mm hole punch. Filters were placed in a loose foil packet in the muffle furnace at 500°C for 4 hours. After removal from the furnace, all work surfaces and implements were wiped down with ethanol or acetone (tweezers, scissors, glass vial, container for diffusion packets). Teflon tape Page 53

was cut into strips about 6 to 7 em long. One filter was placed onto the left side of the strip of Teflon tape leaving about 1 em on the left side. 20 J.!L 2.5M H2 S04 was pipetted onto the centre of the filter. The right half of the tape was folder over the filter. A glass vial was used to seal the teflon tape around the filter. Diffusion packets were stored in a sealed container immediately.

2.6.2

Sample Preparation

For each 100 mL sample added to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, 100 mL of aqueous NaCl solution was added to decrease the solubility ofNH3 (g). Then 0.6 g MgO solid (98% ACS) was added to each flask along with one diffusion packet. Each flask was then covered with parafilm. The flasks were incubated at 30°C for 7 days. After 7 days, the diffusion packet was removed and replaced with a new diffusion packet. 150 mg Devarda's alloy was added to each flask and covered with parafilm. The flasks were returned to the incubator for another 7 days at 30°C.

Diffusion packets removed from the flasks were placed in a Nalgene desiccator for 7 days with approximately 50 mL of 5N H2 S04 · After 7 days, the filter was removed from the Teflon tape and the centre of the filter punched out using a 6 mm hole punch. The punched out portion was placed inside a silver capsule and rolled into a ball. Each ball was placed into a foil packet and labelled for shipping to Cornell Isotope Laboratory (COIL) for analysis. A total of 125 samples were submitted to COIL for analysis.

Sample Analysis

Percent composition of 15N in solid samples submitted to COIL was measured using an elemental analyzer plumbed onto an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). COIL provided a description of the analysis method and EA-IRMS equipment (Appendix 1). Rates of nitrification and ammonification were calculated based on formulas adapted from Nielsen et al. (1992). 0.36% 15N was subtracted to account for naturally occurring background concentrations of the stable isotope (De Laeter et al., 2003).

N Analyses

Two other approaches were attempted and discontinued.

N analysis was attempted using a

procedure adapted from Kieber et al. (1998) which uses chloroform extraction and FT-IR to analyze the concentration of an organic azide. This method was discarded due to poor resolution of the spectra which did not permit quantitative analysis of 14N and 15 N.

15

N analysis was also attempted using the diffusion method by Brooks et al. (1989). This method

was discarded because excessive condensation in the test tubes caused the tin capsules to corrode and disintegrate so samples could not be analyzed.

2.7

N2:Ar and 02:Ar analysis using Membrane Isotope Mass Spec (MIMS)

The methodology used to analyze N 2 :Ar and 0 2 :Ar using MIMS was adapted from Kana et al. (1994).

Water samples analyzed using MIMS are pumped directly from the sample container via a capillary tube into a glass inlet tube. The inlet tube passes through a water bath which regulates the temperature of the sample which then passes into a gas-permeable silicone tube where dissolved gases are sucked out of the line. As a result of reduced pressure in the tube, a vacuum is created and dissolved gases in the water sample diffuse out of the silicone tube and are swept under vacuum into the quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). The glass inlet tube has aU-bend into a dewar of liquid nitrogen. As gases are swept toward the mass spectrometer, water vapour and carbon dioxide are frozen and trapped preventing interference of CO with N 2 (m/z = 28 for each) and damage to filaments by water vapour. The QMS generates a magnetic field in sequence causing the molecules to oscillate. In the QMS, the N 2 molecules pick up a charge

Page 56

which interacts with the QMS field. Smaller molecules travel further with an increased spiral radius. Therefore the distance along the QMS is critical to identifying the molecule. The distance along the path of flight determines the mass of the molecule (i.e. molecules with a smaller m/z travel further along the QMS). The standard used was tap water at a constant temperature of 20°C stirred slowly for at least 48 hours to achieve atmospheric equilibrium while preventing entrainment of gas bubbles. Concentrations of dissolved N 2, 0 2 and Ar were calculated using the solubility equations of Weiss (1970). However Ar is slightly easier to ionize than N 2 so a correction factor was required. The correction factor used was the average of Ar concentrations measured for each batch of samples. A standard was run after approximately 5 samples. Drift was corrected by integrating the values of the standards run before and after each batch of samples.

Denitrification was estimated directly based on changes in N 2:Ar and 0 2:Ar using MIMS (Kana et al., 1994; Kana et al., 1998; Laursen and Seitzinger, 2002). N 2 was measured at

mlz = 28, 29 and 30 which correspond to 14N 2, 14N 15 N and 15N 2. 0 2 was measured at m/z = 32.

N0 3- to the overlying water. Assuming that 14N and 15 N randomly form N 2 gas, the production

of each isotopic form would follow a binomial distribution. Therefore, where the proportion of 14 N is p (and 15N is 1-p), the production rates for each species 8N 2, 29N, 3 ~ 2 ) would be p 2, 2p(1-p) and (l-p) 2, respectively (An et al., 2001).

e

Measured ratios of isotopes included 28N 2, 29N 2, 3 ~ 2 , and calculated ratios included 30N 2: 28N 2 29 28 28 3 and 0 2:Ar. Using these data, ratios of N2: N2, and ~2: N2 were calculated based on the measured values.

Denitrification rates were calculated as follows:

DNR =Total 14N denitrified +Total 15N denitrified

Where Total 14N denitrified is calculated as:

% contribution by diffusion was calculated as follows:

Respiration rates were calculated as follows:

Actual 0 2 concentrations were calculated by multiplying the ratio of 0 2: Ar by the correction 2 factor for Ar. Then average rate of 0 2 production in Jl mol 0 2/m /hour was calculated as:

where [02] is micromoles 0 2/L of water.

It is important to note that the isotope dilution technique used is based on the following two

assumptions:

1.

That the

Materials

Lake sediment used in all of the experiments was obtained from Ms. Emily A wad at the Ministry of Environment. The sediment used consisted of a very fine silty clay material with high organic content. A summary of the originating lake, ELA reference Lake 240, is attached in Appendix 1. A detailed characterization of the sediment is also presented in Appendix 1.

Ciprofloxacin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and was~ 98% purity.

Lake water was prepared according to Ivorra et al. (1995) (Table 2-1 ). However the following growth media ingredients were not added as the intention of these experiments was to assess the function of the naturally-occurring sediment bacteria rather than to cultivate additional bacterial growth (biotin, BaCb, CoCb, thiamine, HEPES and cyanocobalamin). The concentration of NaN0 3 in the lake water solution was 6 mg/L or 70.6 Jlmol/L as NaN0 3 · For 15N analysis, the ratio of 15N:
14 14

N was 1:9 (i.e. 10% 15N, 90% N).

Ethanol as a carrier for cipro

Ethanol was used as a carrier to administer cipro in order to promote even distribution of cipro within the sediments. Ethanol was selected because of its rapid volatilization compared to other carriers. DMSO was not used because of the high organic content potentially causing cipro to bind and alter the predicted effects. Furthermore, 1 mL ethanol administered to the sediments and water was considered too dilute to adversely affect sediment bacteria populations and too small an amount to act as a nutrient.

Prior to starting experiment 2, two microcosms were set up to ensure no adverse effects of using ethanol as a carrier for cipro to promote even distribution within sediments. Oxygen content and bacteria population within the microcosm were measured. Dissolved oxygen (DO)

Page 60

concentrations in the overlying water were measured every 3 hours over a period of 24 hours using a Winkler-type microelectrode (Unisense A/C, Aarhus, Denmark). The response of these electrodes is linear between 0 and 100% saturation. Electrodes were calibrated by sparging water in a calibration chamber with air (for 100% saturation) and N2 (for 0% saturation).

In addition to assessing the effect of ethanol on DO, sediment microorganisms were cultured to

assess the effect of ethanol on the sediment bacteria population. Approximately 1 mL of ethanol was added to the sediment in the second jar. An aliquot of sediment was removed from each jar and placed into two centrifuge tubes with 10 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Both centrifuge tubes were shaken for 2 minutes and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3,000 rpm. 0.1 mL of supernatant from each centrifuge tube was then applied to BBL tryptic soy agar using spread plate method and incubated at 30°C for 24 hours. This procedure was repeated after the sediment had been exposed to ethanol for 48 hours.

2.10

Statistics

Statistical analysis was performed using Systat 11. A summary of statistical analyses run on each data set is included in Appendix 3 with the results of the statistical analysis. 1-way ANOVA and post-hoc paired comparison tests were used to determine significance between cipro treatments. Prior to performing 1-way ANOVA, a one-sample KS test was performed and residuals were plotted to ensure the data were normally distributed. Alpha (a) of 0.05 was used to test the null hypothesis. Linear regression was used to assess dose-dependent effects on each process with increasing cipro concentration. Power analysis used to ensure an appropriate number of treatments and replicates was incorporated into the study design prior to the start of Experiment 2. Power analysis was also used after all experiments were completed to assess whether power could be increased with more treatments and/or replicates. Results of statistical analysis are incorporated into the relevant discussion sections below. Statistically different data groups are indicated on figures using the letters a and b.

RESUTS AND DISCUSSION
Experiment 1 (June 2007)- Effect of cipro on ammonium and nitrate fluxes under substrate-saturating conditions

In order to assess the effects of cipro on nitrogen cycling processes, net potential nitrification and

ammonification were measured by analyzing nitrate and ammonium concentrations in overlying surface water of treated and reference microcosms over a 24 hour period.

3.1.1

Ammonium spike

In the first half of this experiment, the ammonium spike caused ammonium-oxidizers and nitrite-

oxidizers to be saturated. Ammonium flux in the cipro-treated microcosms was significantly lower than the untreated microcosms (F 1,3 = 21.005, p = 0.020) (Figure 3-1). Nitrate flux from sediments was also significantly lower in cipro-treated microcosms than from reference sediments (F 1,2 = 4.600, p = 0.165) (Figure 3-2).

Figure 3-2: Nitrate flux following ammonium spike (Experiment 1)

Page 62

A comparison of Figures 3-1 and 3-2 indicates:

1.

There was no significant difference in ammonium flux (63.1 J.tmol N/m2/h) and nitrate flux (52.0 J.tmol N/m2 /h) in the reference dose. The reference rate of nitrate flux in Figure 3-2 (52.0 J.tmol N/m2 /h) may provide a measure of total nitrification because ammonium was not limited and the consumption of ammonium appeared to be driven strongly by ammonium oxidation.

2.

The rate of ammonium flux in the cipro-treated microcosms (6.2 J.tmol N/m2 /h) was significantly lower relative to reference (63.1 J.tmol N/m2 /h) indicating that ammonium uptake increased (resulting in a lower flux) and/or mineralization (and possibly respiration) decreased due to the presence of cipro.

3.

The addition of ammonium was intended to saturate ammonium oxidation so nitrate flux (measured as nitrate + nitrite) should approximate net nitrification. The rate of nitrate flux in the cipro-treated microcosms (29.8 J.tmol N/m2 /h) was slightly lower relative to reference (52.0 J.tmol N/m2 /h). Therefore, ammonium-oxidizers were being inhibited (i.e. nitrate production was decreased) and/or nitrate immobilization increased (by denitrification or microbial uptake) in the cipro-treated microcosms.

4.

The reduced ammonium flux and nitrate flux in the treated microcosms suggests that cipro may have inhibited ammonium oxidizers and, perhaps, nitrogen immobilization (by sediment microbes).

Page 63

3.1.2

Nitrate Spike

In the second half of this experiment, ammonifiers were saturated by the nitrate spike. The negative rates of ammonium flux (Figure 3-3) indicate that ammonium was being consumed (by nitrification or microbial uptake). There was no significant difference between the rate of ammonium flux in the treated (-16.5 1-1mol N/m /h) and untreated (-19.4 1-1mol N/m /h) microcosms (F 1, 14 = 1.385, p = 0.305) (Figure 3-3). However, there was a significant difference between the rate of nitrate flux in the treated (-13.5 1-1mol N/m2/h) and untreated (29 .8 1-1mol N/m2/h) microcosms (F 1,2 = 4.503, p = 0.168) (Figure 3-4). The positive nitrate flux (Figure 3-4) indicates that nitrate production (by nitrification or mineralization) was greater than nitrate consumption (denitrification or uptake) whereas the reverse appears to be occurring in the ciprotreated microcosms where the rate of nitrate flux was negative.

Page 64

1.

In the reference microcosms, the rate of nitrate flux out of sediments is positive

(29.8 ~mol N/m2/h) compared to a negative rate of ammonium flux out of sediments (19.4 ~mol N/m2/h). The difference in rates may provide an estimate of total denitrification, although this may be confounded by immobilization of nitrogen.

2.

In the references microcosms, flux of nitrate was positive (out of sediments) whereas in the cipro-treated microcosms, net flux of nitrate was negative (into sediments). Under reference conditions and despite nitrate supplied by diffusion, nitrification was greater than denitrification. The results suggest cipro reverses this relationship (i.e. nitrification <denitrification) by two possible mechanisms, namely 1) inhibition of nitrification and 2) stimulation of denitrification. Inhibition of nitrification is consistent with the ammonium spike results obtained in the first half of the experiment, although these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.

3.1.3

Summary of Experiment 1

In the first half of this experiment, the overlying surface water was spiked with ammonium. Therefore, ammonium was not limited and nitrification should theoretically have been maximized. Ammonium flux out of sediments into the overlying surface water in the ciprotreated microcosms was reduced (Figure 3-1) indicating that ammonium may be consumed more rapidly (or produced less rapidly) in the treated microcosms relative to the reference microcosms. Similarly, nitrate flux in the cipro-treated microcosms was slightly lower compared to the reference (Figure 3-2). This result might indicate that either nitrification by ammoniumoxidizers and nitrite-oxidizers was being inhibited and less nitrate was being produced and/or denitrification was being stimulated i.e. nitrification was unable to keep up with denitrification so nitrate was being consumed more rapidly than it was being replaced. As a result, nitrate flux was reduced.

Page 65

In the second half of this experiment, the overlying surface water was spiked with nitrate.

Therefore, nitrate was not limited and denitrification should theoretically have been maximized. There was no apparent effect of cipro on the rate of ammonium flux (Figure 3-3). Nitrate was not limited and nitrate flux into sediments in the treated microcosms was reduced relative to the reference microcosms indicating an inhibitory effect of cipro on nitrate flux (Figure 3-4). This result might indicate that nitrification was being inhibited or denitrification was being stimulated i.e. nitrification was unable to keep up with denitrification so nitrate was being consumed more rapidly than it was being replaced. As a result, the nitrate flux was reduced. These results are consistent with the results observed in the first half of the experiment.

Flux of nitrate in ammonium-saturated water saturated nitrifiers and provided an estimate of potential net nitrification. Flux of nitrate in nitrate-saturated water provided an estimate of potential net nitrate immobilization (denitrification and assimilation). Flux of ammonium minus flux of nitrate in ammonium-saturated water provided an estimate of potential net ammonium assimilation. Flux of ammonium in nitrate-saturated water provided an estimate of net potential ammonification.

Henriksen et al. (1981) measured the difference between ammonium accumulation in the presence and absence of a nitrification inhibitor (N-serve) in sediments of Danish waters and reported potential nitrification rates and nitrate fluxes. Potential nitrification rates ranged from 54.2 to 662.5 J.Lmol N/m2/h in winter and 160.4 to 670.8 J.Lmol N/m2/h in summer. Nitrate fluxes ranged from 4.2 to 25 J.Lmol N/m2/h in winter and 0 to 29.2 J.Lmol N/m2/h in summer. Hall (1986) published nitrification rate data in a mesotrophic lake sediment ranging from 1.6 to 5.6 J.Lg N/g/d (4.8 x 10-3 J.Lmol N/g/h). Binnerup et al. (1992) published nitrate uptake rates and ammonium flux rates from sediments in a Scandinavian fjord in spring, summer and winter. In spring, nitrate uptake and ammonium flux ranged from 7.7 to 27.9 mmol N/m2/d and -3.8 to -1.9 mmol N/m2/d, respectively. In summer, nitrate uptake and ammonium flux ranged from 7.8 to 14 mmol N/m2/d and 2.1 to 5.8 mmol N/m2/d, respectively. In winter, nitrate uptake and ammonium flux ranged from 5.3 to 9.6 mmol N/m /d and 2.5 to 6.7 mmol N/m2/d, respectively.

The published rates vary from the rates measured in this study by one to three orders of magnitude which might be expected given the variations in methodology (use of general inhibitor) and study design (temperature and initial conditions).

By comparing all four rates (Figure 3-5), we can conclude that:

· · ·

Cipro appears to have an effect on either nitrification or denitrification or both Cipro does not appear to have a significant effect on ammonification Rates of ammonification were negative, indicating nitrate was being lost through denitrification (rather than ammonification)

Ammonification
Figure 3-5: Summary offlux changes in Experiment 1

Based on data obtained from this experiment, the combined results may indicate that two possible mechanisms may be at work: 1) inhibition of nitrification and 2) stimulation of denitrification. It is important to note that an inhibitory effect on nitrification does not necessarily preclude stimulation of denitrification and vice versa and, therefore, both processes were studied explicitly. There was no apparent effect on ammonification.

There is little published information on the effects of cipro, or other antibiotics, on nitrification. Zhou et al. (2008) assessed the effects of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg) on nitrification and ammonification and reported that both FQs inhibited nitrification early in the study period (2 to 4 days) but there was no clear concentration-response relative to nitrification rates. Neither FQ had an apparent effect on ammonification which is consistent with the results

Page 68

of this experiment. Ciprofloxacin is a metabolite of enrofloxacin which is used extensively in veterinary medicine (Sukul and Spiteller, 2007). Although the concentrations studied by Zhou et al. are considerably higher than the concentrations studied in this experiment, one might expect to see a continuation of the trend of inhibition of nitrification and/or stimulation of denitrification at high cipro concentrations.

In order to measure the effects of cipro on nitrification and ammonification directly,

15

N

microdiffusion methods were used to study both processes explicitly. Two separate experiments were conducted to assess the effect of cipro on denitrification under nitrate limiting and nonlimiting conditions.

3.2

Experiment 2 (May 2008) - Effect of cipro on nitrification and DNRA

To better determine the explanation for the results of Experiment 1, the objective of Experiment 2 was to study changes in the isotopic composition of the nitrate and ammonium pool. Experiment 2 consisted of two parts: nutrient flux measurements and direct measurements of nitrification and ammonification using 15N stable isotope dilution.

3.2.1

Nutrient Fluxes

Nitrate fluxes were positive except for a large negative nitrate flux (i.e. flux into sediments at 0.5 mg/kg cipro) (F 5,20 = 7 .162, p = 0.001) (Figure 3-6). This data might indicate that either nitrate was lost more rapidly in this treatment due to increased denitrification or that nitrification was being inhibited. In general, ammonium flux decreased with increasing cipro concentration (F 5,22 = 2.057, p = 0.11 0) (Figure 3-7).

In general, production of 15NH4+ (from the 15N0 3- pool) was generally lower at higher cipro
concentrations (Figure 3-9). This slight effect might indicate an increase in ammonium uptake. In addition, the magnitude of ammonification measured by 15N microdiffusion was considerably smaller than the rates calculated by measuring gross ammonium flux. Given the relatively short time frame of this experiment (24 hours), the production of 15NH4+ probably represents mainly dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). However, some N0 3- may also be remineralized following nitrate uptake and incorporation into cells and no distinction was made in this study between assimilatory and dissimilatory ammonification of nitrate. Assuming most of the 15 N0 3- conversion to 15NH4+ was by DNRA, this pathway appears to be a minor contributor to ammonium production in sediment.

Nitrification rates have generally been estimated using 15N tracer techniques in bottle incubations (Ward, 1996a). Binnerup et al. (1992) reported uncoupled nitrification rates measured in 15N0 3dilution in a Scandinavian fjord ranging from 4 to 8.0 mmol N/m2/d in spring, 2.7 to 3.7 mmol N/m 2/d in summer and -1.2 to 0.6 mmol N/m2 /d in winter. Caffrey et al. (2003) used the acetylene inhibition method to study potential nitrification in estuarine sediments of a small estuary in central California and reported spring nitrification rates ranging from 0 to 1. 7 mmol N/m2/d and, in winter ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 mmol N/m2/d. The published rates are approximately one order of magnitude higher than the rates measured in this experiment.

Summary of Experiment 2

Nitrification

The results of both experiments indicate that nitrification is slightly inhibited by cipro. In the previous experiment, nitrate flux was lower in the treated microcosms suggesting either nitrification was inhibited or denitrification was stimulated or both. In this experiment, nitrification was measured indirectly and directly. Both sets of results indicated that there was a slight decrease in nitrification with increasing cipro concentration. Linear regression analysis confirmed a slight dose-dependent response of cipro on nitrification.

In the past, nitrification and DNRA has proven difficult to quantify so published data on these rates in sediments is limited especially in freshwater sediments (Jensen et al., 1996; An and Gardner, 2002). Jensen et al. (1996) measured nitrification and denitrification rates in marine sediments in Germany and reported nitrification rates ranging from 24 to 408 Jlmol/ m 2/d for sandy sediments and nitrification rates ranging from 120 to 672 Jlmol/ m2/d for muddy sediments which the authors attributed to increased organic loading and mineralization.

DNRA

There was no apparent effect on ammonium flux in the first experiment. The results of the second experiment indicated a decrease in ammonium flux with increasing cipro concentration; however, 1-way ANOVA indicated this was not a significant effect. In this experiment, DNRA was also measured directly. Both sets of results indicated that there was no significant effect of cipro on ammonification. Furthermore, 1-way ANOVA indicated no significant treatment effect of cipro on DNRA and linear regression analysis indicated no dose-dependent effect of cipro on DNRA.

Page 73

In general, nitrification showed a tendency toward inhibition by cipro when measured explicitly

by this microdiffusion method. However, there was no indication that DNRA was affected by the presence of cipro. The results of this experiment were generally consistent with the results of the previous experiment.

3.3

Experiment 3 - Effect of cipro on denitrification under low nitrate conditions

Based on the results of Experiment 1, nitrification may have been inhibited or denitrification was stimulated or both. In order to assess the results of Experiment 1, denitrification was measured directly in this experiment.

3.3.1

Nutrient Flux Measurements

Nitrate fluxes were negative except for a positive nitrate flux (i.e. flux out sediments) at 1.5 mg/kg cipro (Figure 3-1 0) where consumption of nitrate by sediments or denitrification exceeded production of nitrate by nitrification or mineralization. More specifically, at higher cipro concentrations, the magnitude of nitrate fluxes was considerably less compared to the reference microcosms and Treatment 1 (0.5 mg/kg). The nitrate fluxes for this experiment were also considerably lower compared to Experiment 2. The magnitude of nitrate flux may have been lower overall due to the reduced concentration of nitrate in overlying surface water. The nitrate concentration in the overlying surface water at the start of the experiment was approximately 7 Jlmol/L (equivalent to 0.1 mg/L N0 3-) and therefore, the conditions for this experiment were relatively nitrate-limited compared to the other experiments. These data might also indicate that either nitrate was lost more rapidly in Treatment 1 due to increased denitrification or that nitrification was being inhibited. 1-way ANOVA indicated a slight treatment effect of cipro on nitrate flux (F
5, 22

= 2.914, p = 0.036).

Page 74

In general, ammonium flux was unaffected by cipro concentration (F

5, 23 =

0.524, p = 0.756)

(Figure 3-11). Note that the overall scale for nitrate flux rates was considerably smaller relative to the magnitude of ammonium flux rates, possibly as a result of nitrate-limited conditions. Results from the previous experiment indicated a slight effect on ammonification at higher cipro concentrations which might indicate an increased uptake of ammonium as a result of increased DNRA. However, there was no corresponding denitrification data for the previous experiment.

Denitrification, Percent Contribution by Diffusion and Respiration

Denitrification

Denitrification decreased at higher cipro concentrations relative to reference and was, in general, positive (Figure 3-12). A decrease in denitrification was observed where nitrate flux reversed direction in Treatment 4, 1.5 mg/kg cipro (Figure 3-1 0). There was no significant effect on ammonium flux (F
5 , 23

= 0.524, p = 0.756) (Figure 3-11 ). The change in direction of nitrate flux

(Figure 3-1 0) could be due to an increase in nitrification although this was not demonstrated by the results of Experiment 2 or by a reduction in denitrification. However, denitrification did not increase with cipro concentration as might be expected from the nitrate flux results suggesting there is some other process responsible for decreased nitrate flux into sediments, potentially a decrease in nitrate uptake by autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms.

Costanzo et al.

Cipro concentrations wer·e 0, 0.1, 10 and 1,000 Jlg/L. The results of the study indicated no significant difference on denitrification between treatments and control except at cipro concentrations above 1 mg/L. However, this may be explained by the study methodology (using the acetylene blockage technique) which may have underestimated denitrification. The results of their study may also be explained by the effect of seawater cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) inhibiting the action of cipro. The authors also referred to anecdotal information from the aquarium industry which relies heavily on nitrogen processing bacteria in biological
filter~

in which inhibition has been reported following antibiotic additions aimed at

treating infections (Costanzo et al., 2005).

Figure 3-13: 0/o Contribution by Diffusion under nitrate-limiting conditions

Percent contribution by diffusion (%Diff) is a measure of the percentage of nitrogen contributed to denitrification from nitrification occurring in the overlying surface water versus nitrate obtained from other processes, primarily coupled nitrification-denitrification processes occurring in sediments (Nielsen et al., 1996). At a relatively lower nitrate concentration, tight coupling was observed between nitrification and denitrification in sediments with nitrate diffusion supplying only 6-14% ofN2 denitrified, (Figure 3-13). Statistical analysis using 1-way ANOVA indicated there was a significant treatment effect on %Diff (F s, 20 = 3.279, p = 0.777, p = 0.387, r2 = 0.031).

= 0.025). However,

linear regression analysis indicated there was no dose-dependent effect of cipro on %Diff (F
1, 24

It remains unclear from this experiment, then, if denitrification was directly inhibited by higher

concentrations of cipro, or if denitrification was indirectly inhibited by substrate limitation due to effects of cipro on nitrification.

Page 78

Note that standard deviation for %Diff is high because these percentages are calculated using measured values of 28N 2 ,
29

N 2 , and 3<N2 . The individual standard deviations for each

measurement therefore affect the standard deviation values for %Diff.

Respiration

As mentioned previously, although not a part of the nitrogen cycle, respiration has a direct effect on nitrogen cycling in sediments as a result of 0 2 distribution and remineralization of organic N. Cipro concentration did not appear to have a significant effect on respiration rates (F 5 ,2o = 1.356, p = 0.279) (Figure 3-14). Linear regression (F
1, 26

= 2.315, p = 0.140, r2 = 0.082) indicated there

was no significant treatment effect on respiration. Overall, this data indicates there may be increase in ammonium uptake rather than a decrease in nitrate mineralization.

Summary of Experiment 3

Under limiting conditions, there appeared to be a dose-dependent response of denitrification to cipro. However, %Diff data indicated these results may be due to tightly coupled nitrificationdenitrification. Therefore it is not possible to conclude whether or not denitrification is directly affected by cipro concentrations. There was no effect on respiration at these concentrations of ctpro.

Nielsen and Glud (1996) measured denitrification using the isotope pairing method both in-situ and in the lab. In-situ denitrification rates were 350 and 470 ~mol N/m2/d in June and November, respectively. Measured rates in the lab study were 290 and 500 ~mol N/m2/d which were not significantly different. Jensen et al. (1996) measured nitrification and denitrification rates in marine sediments in Germany and reported seasonally variable rates depending on nitrate concentrations in the overlying water. When nitrate concentrations were less than 2
~mol/L

(summer and early winter), denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 192 ~mollm 2 /d and, when nitrate concentrations were approximately 70
~mol/L

(late winter and spring), denitrification

rates ranged from 264 to 1,488 ~mol/ m2/d, depending on sediment type. Direct denitrification accounted for 60 to 90% of total denitrification for most of the year except when nitrate was depleted during the summer months. The highest rates of coupled nitrification-denitrification of approximately 50% of total denitrification were reported in the spring. Summer and fall rates of coupled nitrification-denitrification were between 1 and 5% of total denitrification. Denitrification rates and %Diff measured in this experiment were similar to the published rates.

Risgaard-Petersen et al. (1994) reported that coupled denitrification in a Scandinavian fjord represented a small fraction (~ 14%) of total denitrification which is consistent with the results of this experiment. Smith et al. (2006) measured direct and coupled-denitrification rates in benthic sediments of two rivers using IRMS and MIMS and reported good correlation between the two techniques. Furthermore, the authors reported that coupled nitrification-denitrification was not a significant source ofN2 production.

Page 80

Binnerup et al. (1992) published 0 2 uptake rates in a Scandinavian fjord in spring, summer and winter. The rates ranged from 56 to 65 mmol 0 2/m2/d in spring, 62 to 87 mmol 0 2/m2/d in summer and 38 to 57 mmol 0 2/m2/d in )¥inter. The published rates are considerably higher than the rates measured in these experiments, likely because of abundant in-fauna burrowing in the sediments of the shallow fjord (Binnerup et al., 1992).

Experiment 4 (September 2008) - Effect of cipro on denitrification under non-limiting nitrate conditions

In order to assess the results of experiment 3, denitrification was studied under non-limiting

conditions.

3.4.1

Denitrification

In general, this data demonstrated a trend of increasing denitrification rate with increasing cipro

concentration (Figure 3-15). Linear regression analysis indicated a strong dose-dependent response (F1, 25 = 23.048, p ~ 0.05, r2 = 0.480) of denitrification to cipro concentration i.e. increasing denitrification with increasing cipro concentration. This was supported by 1-way ANOVA analysis which indicated a significant treatment effect on denitrification (F
5,21 =

55.419, p ~ 0.05). This trend is a reversal of earlier data obtained in the previous

experiment under nitrate-limiting conditions.

Percent contribution by diffusion

The reversed trend observed in the denitrification data (discussed above) was also apparent in the results for percent contribution by diffusion (%Diff). In this experiment, %Diff ranged from 62 to 100% in the reference and lower cipro doses but dropped in the higher cipro doses, ranging from 13 to 50% (Figure 3-16). %Diffappeared to decrease at the same time denitrification increased (Figure 3-16, 1.5 mg/kg). Denitrification and nitrification are uncoupled at lower cipro concentrations (reference, 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) (i.e. greater contribution of nitrate from the overlying water relative to nitrate contributed by sediment nitrification) but appear to be tightly coupled at higher cipro concentrations (1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg) (i.e. greater contribution to denitrification of nitrate from sediment nitrification processes). 1-way ANOVA analysis indicated a significant treatment effect (F

analysis indicated a strong dose-dependent response (F 1, 25 = 17.543, p :S 0.05, r2 = 0.412) to cipro of %Diff.

Respiration

Rates of 0 2 uptake were slightly larger in magnitude than the rates measured in experiment 3, likely because denitrification was higher due to increased nitrate concentrations. The results of this experiment indicated no effect on respiration at these cipro concentrations (Figure 3-17). 1-way ANOVA analysis and linear regression analysis did not indicate a significant treatment effect of cipro on respiration (F

respiration (F 1, 28 = 0.096, p = 0.759, r2 = 0.003). The results of this experiment confirmed the results of the previous experiment which indicated that cipro does not have an effect on respiration at these concentrations.

Summary of Experiment 4-

In this experiment, under non-limiting conditions, denitrification appears to have been stimulated

by increasing cipro concentrations which confirms the results of the first experiment when nitrate was also not limiting. In the first experiment, nitrate fluxes appeared to indicate that denitrification may have been stimulated (nitrate was consumed at a higher rate ). When nitrate concentrations in the overlying water were relatively high (1 mg N-N0 3 -/L), denitrification again increased with increasing cipro concentrations.

When nitrate concentrations in the overlying surface water were lower in experiment 3 (i.e. nitrate availability in the overlying surface water was limited), the denitrification rate appeared to decrease with increasing cipro concentration with the exception of Treatment 4 (Figure 3-12). Under nitrate-limiting conditions, at higher cipro concentrations (Treatments 3, , 4 and 5), there was tight coupling between nitrification and denitrification as a result of low nitrate availability (Figure 3-13). This resulted in lower rates of denitrification indicating that

Page 84

denitrification may have been limited as a result of decreased supply' of nitrate. This is supported by the directly measured nitrification rates i.e. decrease in nitrification rate with cipro concentration (Figure 3-8).

In experiment 4, the amount of nitrate contributed to denitrification processes as a result of

diffusion from overlying surface water was proportionately greater (Figure 3-16) compared to the contribution of nitrate to denitrification when nitrate was limiting (Figure 3-13).

When nitrate concentrations in the overlying surface water were higher (relative to the previous experimental conditions), these higher levels of nitrate may have been supporting higher rates of denitrification. Denitrification increased with increasing cipro concentration, and may even have been stimulated by cipro at higher concentrations. The results of these two experiments indicate that denitrifiers may be limited by nitrate availability rather than being inhibited directly by c1pro.

Results of DO and CFU counts for ethanol carrier

DO concentrations decreased less than 20% in the jar without ethanol (from 230.645 to 184.799
~mol

0 2/L) and decreased less than 16% (from 230.645to 193.855

~mol

0 2/L) in the

jar containing ethanol (Table A3-1 ). The difference between the two microcosms was not considered to be significant (z = 0.103, p = 0.918). Cell counts for each plate were not considered significantly different after 48 hours (F 1, 2 = 0.009, p = 0.934) (Table A3-2). As such, ethanol was considered to be an acceptable carrier for administering cipro to sediments.

Page 85

3.6

Overall experimental statistical analysis

Results of 2-way ANOVA indicated that there was a significant experiment effect between experiments 3 and 4 when Treatment 4 (experiment 3, 2.0 mg/kg cipro) was omitted (F
1,44 =

5.676. p = 0.022). This was to be expected given the initial concentrations of nitrate

in overlying surface water varied by one order of magnitude (0.1 mg/L and 6 mg/L, respectively). However, there was no significant experimental effect of concentration between the two experiments (F 5, 1 = 1.057, p = 0.397). Results of power analysis indicated an acceptable number of replicates were used in the study design.

3. 7

Ecological implications

Based on these results, it is possible to build a simple predictive model for net nitrate change as a function of cipro concentration.

3. 7.1

Net Change in Nitrification

Using the results of the linear regression analysis on nitrification data, it is possible to predict shifts in nitrification as a result of cipro concentrations measured in the environment.

Based on the regression equation obtained from the nitrification data in experiment 2 (omitting Treatment 2):

Nitrification= 738.11 - 25.58 x cipro concentration

Therefore, for a concentration of 1 mg/kg cipro in the environment, one would expect a 3.5% drop in nitrification rate. For a concentration of2.5 mg/kg cipro in the environment, one would expect an 8.7% decrease in nitrification. Given the size of error bars for this data (some in excess of double the measured rate value), these decreases are not likely to be substantial or ecologically significant.

Page 86

3. 7.2

Net Change in Denitrification

Changes in denitrification are more difficult to predict because denitrification is dependent on nitrate concentrations in overlying water and/or in sediment.

Based on the results of these experiments, under limiting conditions, denitrification might decrease in the presence of cipro. If denitrification is tied to nitrification (low nitrate conditions), any effect of cipro on nitrification would subsequently be reflected in denitrification. Since nitrification was inhibited by cipro, under limiting conditions, denitrification would decrease as the supply of nitrate for coupled nitrification-denitrification decreases.

Using the regression equation obtained from the denitrification data in experiment 3 (omitting Treatment 4, 2.0 mg/kg):

Denitrification= 237.718-58.501 x cipro concentration

In general, denitrification could be expected to decrease with increasing cipro concentration.

For a concentration of 1 mg/kg cipro in the environment, one would expect a 25% drop in denitrification rate. For a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg cipro in the environment, one would expect a 62 % decrease in denitrification.

Under non-limiting conditions, denitrification becomes uncoupled from nitrification and might be expected to increase as a result of the additional supply of nitrate from overlying water. If denitrification is controlled by diffusion of nitrate from overlying water, the effects of cipro on denitrification should be independent of the effects of nitrification in sediments. This was demonstrated at the lower cipro concentrations in Experiment 4 when denitrification and nitrification became uncoupled.

Page 87

Based on the regression equation obtained from the denitrification data in experiment 4:

Denitrification= 80.611 x cipro concentration- 4.188

In general, denitrification could be expected to increase slightly with increasing cipro concentration. Denitrification could potentially be stimulated by cipro because of reduced competition for nitrate by other bacteria. This may also be a slight hormetic effect where small doses of a contaminant cause increased metabolic activity. Again, as substantial increases in denitrification are only likely to be realized where cipro concentrations are on the high end of the scale of environmental relevance, the impacts of cipro are expected to be negligible to marginally beneficial in culturally-eutrophied systems.

3.7.3

Respiration Effects on Nitrification and Denitrification

Nitrification and denitrification are dependent on respiration which determines the depth and distribution of the oxic zone. In this study, where rates were measured in the dark, aerobic respiration rates determined depth and distribution of oxygen in sediments rather than photosynthetic activity. However, the results of these experiments indicate respiration was not affected by cipro at these concentrations. If cipro inhibits respiration, the oxic zone should become broader. Nitrification might be expected to increase as a result. However, the effect on respiration could be mitigated by direct impacts of cipro on nitrification. Since these experiments demonstrated an effect of cipro on nitrification, it is not inconceivable that an effect on respiration was not observed because nitrification was inhibited and the nitrifiers would normally compete for 0 2 with heterotrophs thereby obscuring the effect of cipro on nitrification.

If cipro inhibits respiration, denitrification could either increase or decrease. Denitrification would increase if denitrification was controlled predominantly by coupled nitrificationdenitrification because the oxic zone would increase in thickness effectively increasing nitrification by increasing the volume of sediments where nitrification occurs. If, however,

Page 88

nitrate conditions were limiting and cipro inhibits respiration, denitrification might increase if the supply of nitrate was predominantly from overlying water because the oxic zone would become thinner thereby decreasing the distance required for diffusion of nitrate from the overlying water. But, under the same nitrate-limiting conditions, if respiration was inhibited, denitrification would decrease if the source of nitrate for denitrification was diffusion of nitrate from overlying water because the zone of denitrification would be further from the sediment surface (i.e. deeper).

However, the results of these experiments indicated cipro does not have an effect on respiration at these concentrations. Therefore, since respiration was not affected, denitrification was not affected by change in oxygen distribution. Maul et al. (2006) assessed the effect of cipro on respiration on leaf-associated microbial communist and found no effects at 1.0 to 10
14

~giL.

Naslund et al. (2008) studied the effect of cipro on mineralization of sediment-associated C-labelled pyrene and sediment community bacterial structure in natural marine sediment.

The authors reported that pyrene degradation was negatively affected by cipro and showed a dose-dependent response to concentration. An EC 50 for inhibition of pyrene mineralization of 560
~giL

cipro corresponded to a dry sediment weight of0.4

~glkg

cipro using reported log KI

values of2.9-4.3. Furthermore, bacterial community structure changed in addition to a decrease in diversity at cipro concentrations above 1 mgiL. The lowest effect level occurred at 200 J..Lg/L which corresponds to approximately 0.1
~glkg

cipro (Naslund et al., 2008).

3.7.4

Ammonification and DNRA

In general, there was no significant effect on ammonium flux although a slight decrease in

ammonification measured directly was observed in Experiment 2. This decrease in ammonium flux may have been due to increased ammonium uptake as a result of increased denitrification or, more likely given the short time-frame of this experiment, due to DNRA processes.

Page 89

If effects of cipro on ammonification were observed, these effects would also be observed in respiration data because the process of oxidizing organic compounds consumes 0 2 and releases NH4+(van Beelen and Doelman, 1996). However, no effect was observed in either process which is not unexpected given that ammonification and respiration are not very sensitive processes relative to nitrification.

CONCLUSION

In summary, these experiments were designed to assess the effects of cipro on four processes:
nitrification, denitrification, ammonification (DNRA) and remineralization (using respiration as a proxy) in a simple microcosm of lake sediment and surface water. Nitrate and ammonium fluxes were first measured indirectly to provide an indication of the effect of cipro on potential net nitrification and potential net ammonification. Nitrification and ammonification were then studied directly using
15

N isotope dilution methods. Finally, denitrification and respiration were

studied directly under nitrate-limiting and non-limiting conditions by measuring changes in N 2:Ar and 02:Ar using MIMS.

Of these four processes, ammonification and respiration were not significantly affected by these concentrations of cipro. Nitrification appeared to be slightly inhibited by cipro at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg in sediment. Based on these data, it is not possibly to conclusively state whether denitrification is specifically affected by cipro or by limitation of nitrate. In nitrate-limiting conditions, denitrification was tightly coupled to nitrification and therefore inhibited by low nitrate concentrations. Denitrification appeared to be stimulated by cipro when nitrate concentrations were not limiting.

The methods used in these experiments demonstrated that cipro does have an effect on nitrogen cycling, although the impacts on nitrification and denitrification are likely to be realized only at the highest concentrations measured in the environment, possibly only in spatially localized areas or hot spots. At the lower end of the environmentally relevant concentration range, observed impacts are not likely to be ecologically important, especially when averaged over an entire lake ecosystem.

Previous studies have focused on toxicity effects and growth inhibition of cipro and other FQs (Robinson et al., 2005; Backhaus et al., 2000; Froehner et al., 2000; Wollenberger et al., 2000; Backhaus and Grimme, 1999; Holten-Lutzhoft et al., 1999) but few have assessed microbial function such as nitrification (Halling-Sorensen, 2001; Kiimmerer et al., 2000; Al-Ahmad et al., 1999), denitrification (Costanzo et al., 2005) and respiration (Naslund et al., 2008; Maul et al., 2006). This study has demonstrated that cipro affects nitrification and, indirectly, denitrification as a result of nitrification inhibition. As predicted, slight shifts in the function of nitrogen cycling bacteria were observed in the presence of cipro. Gomez et al. (1996) reported no effects of five antibiotics on nitrifying sludge (no FQs were studied) indicating that heterotrophic organisms may be less sensitive to antibiotics than other autotrophs. So, although nitrifying bacteria may be inhibited by cipro, the implications for ecosystem function may not be considerable. The significance of these shifts over the long-term and the implications for development of microbial resistance to antibiotics have yet to be determined. Future research directions might include the use of molecular biology techniques such as DNA amplification using PCR to assess shifts in community composition or assessment of possible synergistic effects of cipro and other antibiotics or pharmaceuticals on nitrogen cycling.

A1.1

Ammonium Analysis

Ammonium concentrations were measured using the colorimetric phenol-hypochlorite method. Alkaline phenol and hypochlorite react with ammonium to form indophenol blue which is proportional to ammonium concentration. The blue colour is intensified by sodium nitroprusside. For each 10 mL sample of overlying water collected in a sample tube, two 5 mL replicates were extracted for analysis. The following reagents were added to each 5 mL subsample: 200 J.!L phenol solution, 200 J.!L sodium nitroprusside (0.5% w/v) and 500 J.!L oxidizing solution (alkaline citrate and sodium hypochlorite). A new bottle of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) was purchased each week and oxidizing solution was prepared fresh for each batch of samples analyzed. The samples were covered and stored in the dark for at least 1 hour to allow colour development to occur. Colorimetric analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UVNis spectrophotometer using a wavelength of 640 nm. A standard curve was created by diluting a stock solution of7.1 mmol NIL (100 mg/L) ammonium bromide solution to the following concentrations: 0, 7.1 Jlmol/L, 17.8 Jlmol/L, 35.5 Jlmol/L and 71 Jlmol/L (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L).

Deviations from the method included use of ammonium bromide stock solution instead of ammonium chloride, reduction of sample volume and corresponding volumes of colour reagents.

A1.2

Nitrate Analysis

Nitrate+ nitrite concentrations were measured using a modified copper-cadmium reduction column to reduce nitrate to nitrite which is then quantified by diazotizing with sulfanilamide and coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a highly coloured reddish purple azo dye which is measured colorimetrically using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UVNis spectrophotometer (American Public Health Association, 1998). Nitrate was measured as nitrate plus nitrite. Quantification of nitrite concentrations was not considered relevant for the purposes of this study, particularly as it was not a component of the synthetic lake water and concentrations of nitrite were not expected to be significant.

Page 108

The cadmium reduction column construction consisted of a 4 mm inside diameter 10 em length stainless steel tube with approximately 55 em long 2 mm inside diameter flexible plastic tubing. Cadmium granules were rinsed in a solution of 50 % 10 N hydrochloric acid, then washed three times in copper sulphate solution and rinsed in deionized water. The column was then packed with cadmium granules. The column was rinsed with NH4 Br-EDTA buffer solution and primed with a 25% solution of7.1 mmol NIL (100 mg/L) sodium nitrate. Solution was pumped through the column using a Rainin Rabbit ®peristaltic pump. The pumping rate was approximately 5 mL per minute.

According to the column dimensions and length of plastic tubing, the volume of the system was approximately 3.7 mL. For each sample reduced through the column, approximately 5 mL was purged prior to sample collection. The column porosity was not accounted for in this calculation so 5 mL was considered a sufficient quantity to ensure that the volume of sample in the column had been completely replaced.

For each 5 mL sample of overlying water collected in a sample tube, 15 mL ofNH4 Br-EDTA buffer solution was added to the sample. The entire volume was then pumped from a graduated cylinder through the column. Two 5 mL samples were collected in a test tube and 200 J.!L colour reagent was added immediately. The samples were covered and stored in the dark for a maximum of 2 hours to allow colour development to occur. Colorimetric analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UVNis spectrophotometer using a wavelength of 543 nm. A standard curve was created by diluting a stock solution of 100 mg/L sodium nitrate solution to the following concentrations: 0, 7.1 J..Lmol/L, 17.8 Jlmol/L, 35.5 J..Lmol/L and 71 J..Lmol/L (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L).

Deviations from the method included use of sodium nitrate stock solution instead of potassium nitrate, reduction of sample size and corresponding colour reagent and buffer volumes.

COIL Methodology

COIL provided the following description of the analysis method and EA-IRMS equipment.

"The Cornell Isotope Laboratory utilizes a Finnigan Delta Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) interfaced to a Carlo Erba NC2500 elemental analyzer (Italy) for the analysis ofN based organic materials. This process involves combustion at a high temperature (1 000° C) in the presence of chromium III oxide and copper oxide. Once combustion is complete the resultant analyte gas is further reduced to N2 in the presence of copper. Water is removed from the sample using a magnesium perchlorate trap. The sample is then sent through a gas Chromatography column and sent into the IRMS. In the IRMS the analyte N2 gas is ionized at upwards of 3 kilovolts and separated by mass into heavy (29N 2 - 15N + 14N) and light (28N2 - 14N + 14N) isotope ratios. The masses are detected in a collector system at the end of the mass spectrometer flight tube and calculated into 15N/ 4N ratios. A delta 15N signature is then derived based on the Atmospheric Air reference scale. In addition to simply deriving isotope signatures, the precision of the instrument is determined by analyzing internal standard materials. These are run for accuracy and precision purposes but also to check instrument linearity. In the case of enriched sample types it is an effective way to determine carryover from 1 sample to the next. We used several internal and chemical standards. These are biannually calibrated against known IAEA reference materials. Precision on enriched sample types is not guaranteed but we are able to show just how much carryover we are getting based on these internal standards. " (Pers. corr.)

Lake 240 {49°39'35.06"N, 93o43'43.24"W) is a drainage lake located in the boreal forest of the Precambrian Shield of northwestern Ontario at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) near Kenora (Brunskill and Schindler, 1971). It is part of a 723-ha watershed characterized by wetlands, six lakes, and forests dominated by immature jackpine and paper birch (St. Louis eta/., 1994). Lake 240 has only one outflow into Dryberry Lake which drains into Lake of the Woods (Sellers et a/., 2001, Brunskill and Schindler, 1971). It receives water directly from Lake 239 and Lake 470, which are connected to it by short streams (Sellers eta/., 2001). The Experimental Lakes field station is located at the junction of lakes 239 and 240. A 6.6 km road leads into the field station and the necessary electrical, water, and sewage systems have been in place since it's opening in 1968 (Johnson and Vallentyne, 1971).
