Abstract
Crosslaminated timber (CLT) panels have potential market in North America for building midrise structures due to their good structural and seismic performance, light weight, and prefabricated nature. However, to ensure longterm durability, the hygrothermal performance of CLT wall assemblies needs to be evaluated in terms of drying and wetting potential before their widespread adoption in North America. A test wall was constructed with initially wetted CLT panels, and monitored over a year. The dryingbehaviourofthepanelswasanalysed,andresultswerecomparedtohygrothermalsimulations.It was found from the field data that no tested wall assemblies in the given climate prevented the panels fromdryinginenoughtimetopreventdecayinitiation.Thehygrothermalsimulationprogramiscapable of predicting general trends, and can predict if a wall be safe, but tends to be overly conservative. Furtherrefinementofthemodelforwoodisneeded.

Chapter 1 - Introduction Crosslaminated timber (CLT) panels have potential market in North America for building midrise structures due to their good structural and seismic performance, light weight, and prefabricated nature. ManyofthesebenefitsareoutlinedintheCLTHandbook(GagnonandPirvu,2011).However,prolonged exposuretomoisturebeforeandduringconstructionaswellasinservicecanbeadurabilityconcernfor most wood products including CLT. Specifically, CLT panels stored on unprotected construction sites can be exposed to rain and sitting water, leading to builtin moisture after erection. If this builtin moisture cannot dry out within a reasonable time period, potential damage as a result of excessive moisture may occur. To ensure longterm durability and improve the design of CLT assemblies, the hygrothermal performanceofCLTwallassemblieswithavarietyofconfigurationsandmaterialsneedstobeevaluated intermsofdryingandwettingpotentialbeforetheirwidespreadadoptioninNorthAmerica. This project is a part of the multidisciplinary NSERC strategic research Network for Engineered Wood based Building Systems (NEWBuildS).  The network of research focuses on a variety of aspects surrounding the use of massive timber systems, primarily crosslaminated timber panels and glulam beams and columns.  Topics include material characterization, structural, fire, acoustic, and vibration performance, integration into hybrid structural systems, and product durability. This project, a part for Theme4focusingondurability,wasdevelopedaftersimulationsperformedatFPInnovationsindicateda very low drying potential for CLT wall assemblies with low permeance membranes and insulating materials to the exterior or interior of the panels (Wang and Baldracchi 2009; RDH Engineering Group 2009). Although CLT has already been in use in Europe with no reported moisture durability issues so far, differing climates, construction practices, and wood species in North America introduce uncertainty as to the effect of potential elevated moisture content of the panels at the time of construction and in serviceonlongtermmoisturedurability.Furthermore,inadditiontoknownlimitationstohygrothermal modelling of wood building envelope assemblies, no hygrothermal model has been validated for large crosssection wood outside of a laboratory environment, relying instead on standard testing performed onsamplestypically25mmthick.
1.1 Objectives

The objective of the project is to evaluate the drying potential of a variety of wall assemblies including wetted CLT panels manufactured with North American wood species groups, in a Southern Ontario climate, and to provide data to help validate a hygrothermal simulation model.  As a result, recommendations may be made regarding the criticality of protecting the panels from moisture sources 1

and the suitability of different wall assemblies to ensure the longterm durability of CLT wall assemblies. The data collected will improve understanding of the effect of adjacent materials in the assemblies and wood species used for CLT manufacturing on drying behaviour, as well as help calibrate CLT material properties to allow for future hygrothermal modelling. By testing multiple samples of different species, the variability between wood species and samples of the same species may be studied to help improve materialselectionforCLTmanufacturing.
1.2 Approach

In order to capture the drying of CLT panels in situ, a field study has been performed, incorporating four different wall assemblies and five different types of CLT panels.  The field study was performed in conjunction with laboratory testing of panels from the same sources, by Lepage (2012), which empirically determined the water adsorption and redistribution coefficients to be used in hygrothermal modelling,aswellasothermodificationstobemadetothematerialproperties. The field study was designed to monitor wall assemblies including insulating materials and water resistive membranes of varying orders of magnitude of vapour permeance, with panels initially wetted toalevelwhichallowedapossibilityofdecayinitiationinthefuture.Themoisturecontentinthecentre of the panels, and in the exterior and interior faces of the panels was monitored and analysed to determine differences in the amount of time required for the panels to dry to a safe level to prevent decayinitiation,anddifferencesbetweenthewallassemblies,andthepanelsources. The data collected was then compared to the model developed by Lepage (2012), to test it validity. Additional modifications to the model were made based on laboratory testing results, which improved theagreementofthemodelwiththefieldmeasurements.
1.3 Scope

Thescaleofthefieldtestingislimitedbytime,space,datacollectioncapacity.Thetestwalliscomposed of small scale panels, of the original manufactured depth, but approximately 600mm x 600mm, compared to the typical panel size of at least 1200mm x 2400mm. However, the reduced scale is not expectedtocausechangesindryingrateduetoedgeeffectsasthemoisturecontentpinsareplacedina central area around 150mm x 50mm large, and the edges were sealed before wall construction.  The moisture pins in the interior faces were centred on the lumber element in which they were placed, however at the exterior, as the pins were inserted through the water resistive membranes, it cannot be

certain where in the plank they were placed, which may introduce anomalies caused by edge effects at theboundariesbetweenplanks,aswellaschecksandknotsinthewood. The field test facility is located in Waterloo, Ontario, and experiences a southern Ontario.  Differing climates may cause panels to dry at different rates, highlighting the need for a reliable hygrothermal modeltoextrapolatetheresultsacrossNorthAmerica. The panels were initially wetted to extreme levels to allow the possibility of decay initiation, and more field research may need to be done to determine the highest moisture contents which may be found duringconstructionindifferentclimatesandfordifferentCLTproducts. The moisture content data has been compared to simulation results provided by WUFI, a widely used onedimensional hygrothermal simulation program developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics.Inthefutureothersimulationprogramsshouldbevalidated. This thesis presents a review of moisture transport in wood and current work related to modelling the hygrothermal behaviour of wood. The methodology used in this field study is detailed, and the drying behaviour of the CLT samples during the first year of testing is presented. Finally, a comparison of the fieldmeasurementstohygrothermalsimulationresultsismade.

Chapter 2 - Literature Review
2.1 Cross-laminated timber

Cross laminated timber is an engineered wood product in use in Europe since the 1980s.  It has been recently introduced to Canada and the USA as a structural panel element suitable for use in midrise buildings, in place of more traditional concrete, cinder block, or steel systems. Demand for CLT in North America has grown after changes to building codes in a number of jurisdictions have allowed or will allowwoodstructuresuptosixstoriestallinsteadoffour. It is expected that the majority of CLT production will occur in western Canada, using lumber from mountainpinebeetleinfestedforests,whichismechanicallysoundbutoftendiscolouredwithbluestain fungus, rendering it undesirable aesthetically for many uses (Gagnon and Pirvu, 2011).  Commercial productionofCLThasalsobeguninQuebec. Cross laminated timber, shown in Figure 2.1, is composed of at least three and typically up to seven layers of lumber boards, joined with adhesives or mechanical fasteners such that adjacent layers are aligned perpendicular to each other.  This configuration increases dimensional stability and gives the panels similar strength capacities in all directions.  The layers are typically composed of dimensional lumber, but other sizes or types of engineered wood product can be used if desired, and alternating layers often include different timber element sizes, though are usually symmetrical around the centre layer(GagnonandPirvu,2011).


Figure2.13plyCrosslaminatedTimber(Karacabeyli,2011)

The typical panels are usually assembled with adhesives, the most common being polyurethane.  The layers may be face glued only, between layers, or face and edge glued, between layers and between boards within a layer.  Individual boards may be finger jointed together at the end grain to increase

4

board length.  After assembly, the panels are pressed together, both horizontally and vertically, then planedorsandedifrequired(GagnonandPirvu,2011). The panels may be precut for each project at the production plant, and may be preassembled with insulation and other building assembly elements, allowing for accelerated construction schedule after deliveryonsite.
2.2 Studies into CLT behaviour

While there have been several studies of CLT or other wood behaviour using hygrothermal simulations, few experiments including verification with field measurements have been performed. The majority of these studies utilise existing computer simulation programs, such as WUFI, which has a foundation in Fick's Law, modelling vapour and liquid transport based on a vapour pressure difference or moisture contentgradientandacoefficientdescribingthematerial'spermeability.However,thereareindications whichsuggesttheFickianmodelbecomeslessaccurateabovethefibresaturationpointofwood,around 28%moisturecontent(MC)(HÃ¥kansson,1998). Haglund (2007) developed a model to determine the effect of yearly relative humidity variations of a Swedishclimateonthemoisturecontentofwoodbeams.TheFickianmodelpredictedasimilarrangeof moisturecontentsaslaboratorymeasurementsofthebeams,anddifferenceswereexplainedduetothe lack of hysteresis in the model as the moisture contents were well below the fibre saturation point, never reaching higher than 18%. Goto (2011) has performed climate chamber tests of high permeance CLT wall assemblies with continuous, exterior insulation, and found the measured results for relative humidity and temperature at monitor positions within the wall assembly to be in accordance with WUFI simulations, though the moisture content within the panels themselves were not tested, and panels were not wetted. Successful work has also been done to verify the temperature and relative humidity predicted by WUFI 2D around a stud in a timber framed wall with measurements taken in a laboratory setting (Kalamees, 2003).  Finally, it has been shown by Hameury (2004) that massive timber walls, where wood is directly exposed to the indoor environment can have an appreciable buffering effect, reducingthemoistureloadofabuilding.OnceagainaFickianmodelwasused,andonlyappliedinalow moisturecontentrange. A principal resource used in the analysis of the field experiment is the results of laboratory testing performed on the same lot of panels used in the test wall at the University of Waterloo by Lepage (2012).  This work provided material properties relating to moisture uptake of the panels used in this experiment, allowing for more accurate models to be constructed and compared to the field 5

measurements. The studies outlined have not served to examine the actual drying behaviour of CLT panels in situ.  The following description of moisture flow in wood and studies into the modelling of moisture flow in wood will support the need for the use of more data collected in situ to use in the developmentofamoreaccuratemodel.
2.3 2.3.1 Moisture Transport in Softwood Structure of wood: macroscopic scale

On a macroscopic scale, the structure of wood within a tree can be divided in two ways, sapwood vs. heartwood,andearlywoodvs.latewoodineachgrowthring,seeninFigure2.2(FPL,2010). As a tree grows each year, a growth ring is developed around the perimeter of the tree, including one layer of early wood and one layer of late wood.  The early wood develops in the beginning of the growing season, and has cells with thin walls and a high degree of connectivity, allowing for faster transportation of water and nutrients during the growth of the tree.  Later in the year, late wood is added, which has fewer interconnecting pits and is denser, contributing more to the strength of the wood.Thedarkercolourofthelatewoodmarkstheboundariesoftheyearlygrowthrings. Whileringsofearlyandlatewoodarerepeatedmanytimesacrossacrosssectionofthetruck,thetrunk may also be divided into a central column of darker heartwood, and an outer layer of sapwood.  The sapwood is the location where conduction and storage of water and nutrients takes place during tree growth. As a tree grows, the sapwood towards the centre of the tree is slowly converted to heartwood by the deposition of extractives, which can have many purposes but typically increase the resistance of theheartwoodtomoldandrot,darkenthewood,andpartiallyblockthepitsconnectingcells. The trunk of a tree is the basis of the three principal axes used when discussing wood, longitudinal, radial and tangential. The longitudinal direction is along the tree trunk, the radial direction is from the pithatthecentreofthetrunktothebark,andthetangentialdirectionistangentialtothegrowthrings.

2.3.2

Structure of wood: microscopic scale

Softwood is composed of a series of long, longitudinally oriented, tapered cells, connected through pits located primarily to allow tangential flow (Krabbenhoft, 2003).  The longitudinal cells are interspersed with raycells,whichareoriented to facilitatetransportintheradialdirection. Apitinonecellis usually paired with a pit in the adjacent cell wall, directly connecting their lumens, the cavities inside the cells. ThecellulararrangementcanbeseeninFigure2.3. In green wood, ray cells allow for faster moisture transport in the radial direction, despite the higher numberofpitsinthetangentialdirection.Also,thehighernumberofpits,andthinnercellwallsleading to higher porosity in the early wood provide less resistance to moisture flow than the more dense configuration of late wood cells with fewer pits. However, when wood is dried, many of the pits in the early wood cells become aspirated, meaning they irreversibly deform to a point block moisture transport.Pitsinthelate woodaspiratetoalesser degreedue tothestrongerstructureswithin thecell wall.Thedifferenceinthenumberofaspiratedpitsislargeenoughthatwheninadrystate,asisusedin all manufactured wood products, the late wood is actually more permeable than the early wood. The difference is also more pronounced in sapwood, as the extractives deposited in the pits of the heartwoodcellsalreadyreducestheirpermeability.

2.3.3

Structure of wood: molecular scale

Wood's cellular structure is composed of three polymers, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Krabbenhoft, 2003). With variation among different species, wood is composed of 40 to 50% cellulose, with the remainder divided approximately equally between hemicellulose and lignin.  These polymers arejoinedintomicrofibrilsand theirsurroundingsubstance,andarrangedinvaryinglayerstocreatecell wallsandthemiddlelamellawhichbindscellstogether.
2.3.4 Conditions for Wood Decay

Decay in wood is caused by certain types of fungi which can feed on the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the wood cells, breaking them down, eliminating their structural capacity. In order for decay to initiate, the appropriate fungi spores or mycelium must be present, and the fungi must have access to sufficient moisture, nutrients, oxygen, and be in a reasonably warm environment and with favourable competitionsoverothermicroorganisms(Wang,2010).Asignificantperiodoftimecanalsoberequired for fungi to propagate to a level which can influence the strength of the wood infected, depending on the conditions.  Typically, wood exposed to temperatures below 10Â°C, and at a moisture content in equilibrium at a relative humidity below 80% is considered safe from moisture durability issues such as moldanddecay. A review of the conditions required for decay initiation and progression by Wang (2010) has shown that a constant elevated moisture content over a long period of time is required to initiate decay.  It was found that at a marginal moisture content of 26%, 6 to 12 months are required for decay initiation for typical kiln dried wood products. However, if the wood products were held in conditions ideal for decay to initiate and progress, such as a moisture contents of 40 to 80%, the wood products could lose 8

significant strength in as little as 3 months.  MC of 20% is a safe maximum moisture content level to specify, which provides a considerable safety margin for anomalous wood samples which may be extremely hydroscopic, or have poor decay resistance. Measurements taken from lumber at an active construction siteofawoodframe buildingduringthewinterrainyseasoninVancouvershowed thatthe average wood moisture content remained around 20%, before the structure was covered with roof and space heating provided (Wang, 2012). There were large variations in MC when the lumber was exposed to outside conditions. This seems to indicate that taking reasonable precautions to protect lumber and other solid wood products from wetting, less than 20% moisture content at the time of building enclosure is achievable. However, it is known that composite materials such as plywood and OSB can absorbmoisturemorequicklythansolidwood,althoughtheymaybeabletodryfasteraswell.
2.3.5 Moisture transport mechanisms in softwood

There are three different types of moisture in wood, free water, bound water, and water vapour. Bound water is chemically bonded to fibres in the cell walls (Krabbenhoft, 2003).  Free water is liquid water existing in the lumens, present when the cell walls are saturated with bound water.  Water vapour is present both in the air and in the lumens when they are not full of free water, and in small quantities in thecellwalls. The flow of free water in wood is governed by Darcy's law, which describes flow of a fluid through a porousmedium. Theflowofboundwaterisgovernedbydiffusionthroughthecellwall. The flow of water vapour is divided into two mechanisms, the flow of air carrying water vapour through pits and lumens, and adsorption of water vapour onto the cell wall, diffusion through the wall, and desorption from the wall. In small capillaries, water vapour may also condense. These mechanisms are described with a combination of Darcy's law, and Fick's law, which uses a diffusion coefficient to relate fluxtoaconcentrationgradient. Although the material properties of wood, especially the diffusivities of bound water and water vapour vary at a microscopic scale in different parts of the wood cell and between early wood, late wood, sapwoodandheart wood, whenmodelling moisture movementinwood, numericalmodels aretypically designed which utilise bulk material properties, and are based on moisture movement in general hygroscopicporousmaterials.Theydonotaccountforanyanomaliescausedbythecellularstructureof wood compared to compounds where the material composing the pore structure is homogenous and

2.4 WUFI simulation parameters

WUFI (Kunzel, 1995) is a hygrothermal simulation program widely employed due to its range of customisable material properties, level of verification for many typical wall assemblies and materials, and ease of use. The basic parameters required to define a material are its bulk density, porosity, heat capacity, heat conductivity, and the diffusion resistance factor a multiplier to be applied to the permeability of stagnant air to obtain the permeability of the material. The moisture storage function and liquid transport coefficients for suction and redistribution must also be defined, describing the predominantmoisturetransportmechanisms. The moisture storage function describes the moisture content of a material obtained when the surface of the pore system has accumulated enough water molecules to be in equilibrium with the relative humidity of the ambient air.  This includes adsorption of water vapour at lower relative humidities, capillarycondensationatrelativehumiditiescloseto100%,andcapillaryormechanicalsaturationofthe poresystemwithfreewaterat100%relativehumidity.The moisturestoragefunction(MSF)isobtained by measuring sorption isotherms up to 95% RH, and through pressure plate measurements at higher relative humidities in the presence of free water.  For wood, the MSF combines the moisture content derived from bound water, free water, and water vapour, and an average MSF is used, as wood typically hasdifferent adsorptionanddesorptioncurves.WUFIassumesinstantaneousacquisitionofequilibrium moisture content to local relative humidity with pores. In reality the equilibrium process usually takes a longtime. InFigure2.4,atypicalmoisturestoragefunctionforaporoushygroscopicmaterialisshown.InregionA, water vapour molecules are adsorbed onto the pore structure's walls in a single layer. In region B, the several layers of water molecule are present on the pore walls, and region C, as the layers on opposite walls meet, capillary suction begins.  In region D, the capillaries are the dominant water storage mechanism,andinregionE,thecapillariesaresaturated,andfreewaterexistsinthepores.Thearrows indicatethedifferentcurvesusedforwettinganddrying,accountingforhysteresis.

Figure2.4TypicalMoistureStorageFunction(Straube,2005)

The rate of capillary liquid transport is governed in WUFI by two liquid transport coefficients, one for suction and one for redistribution. Based on Fickian diffusion, the liquid transport flux is expressed in terms of a moisture content gradient, and a diffusion coefficient which may be constant, or vary based onmoisturecontent. The liquid transport coefficient for suction describes the capillary uptake when the surface of the material is in direct contact with liquid water, for example exposed to rain. This initial suction phase is governed by larger capillaries with low flow resistance.  The values for the coefficient for suction at a given moisture content is often estimated based on the free water saturation moisture content of the material, and it's avalue, or water absorption coefficient. For this project, the avalue of the CLT panels usedwasmeasuredinlaboratorytestingbyLepage(2012). The liquid transport coefficient for redistribution describes the further migration of water through the material. This moisture movement is driven by the higher tension forces in smaller capillaries, drawing the liquid out of the larger capillaries.  While it is acceptable for some materials to estimate this coefficient as the same as the coefficient for suction up to the equilibrium moisture content at 80% relative humidity, and one tenth of the value of the coefficient for suction at higher moisture contents, this relationship does not hold true for wood.  One reason for the discrepancy is the presence of the adsorptiondiffusiondesorption mechanism transporting bound water and water vapour across the cell 11

walls which is not accounted for in the typical Fickian model of porous materials (HÃ¥kansson, 1998). Changes in the permeability of the pore system may also occur due to changes in the structure of the pits in the cell walls having experienced differing states of hydration, a factor contributing to hysteresis. For this project, the profile for the liquid transport coefficient for redistribution at a given moisture content was based on the profile derived by Lepage (2012) during laboratory testing on the same CLT panels.
2.5 Hygrothermal Modelling Limitations

WUFIhasbeenverifiedforalargerangeofbuildingmaterialsincludingmanyengineeredwoodproducts such as plywood and OSB. However, there are some known limitations to modelling the hygrothermal behaviour of wood at high relative humidities (Peuhkuri, 2003). As WUFI is currently limited to a single moisture storage function, does not account for hysteresis, and does not allow for input to modify the time scale required for a wood sample to attain moisture equilibrium, it is expected that the results of simulationsatallmoisturecontentsmaynotcorrelatewelltomeasureddata. Byonlyaccountingforthedifferenttransportmechanismsaffectingliquidwaterandwatervapourinthe porestructureinsteadofmodellingboundandfreewaterseparately,errorsmaybeintroducedwhenthe relationships between them shift.  Specifically, WUFI does not address the movement of moisture by adsorption,diffusionanddesorptionthroughthecellwalls,asthestructureoftypicalporousmaterialsis considered inactive in moisture transport (Kunzel, 1995). Several of the known discrepancies have been studied. Wang (2012) suggests that rather than a single moisture storage function, separate curves be used to define bound water sorption, capillary condensation of water vapour, and free water. A model of this type is also supported by WadsÃ¶ (1994), who described the requirements for a hygrothermal model to include the nonFickian sorption behaviour of wood, especially at high relative humidities. WadsÃ¶ emphasises the presence of seperate models for the flow of vapour and water through the pore structure, and for sorption into the cell walls. He also specifies that the models must allow for different behaviour due to rapid and slow changes in vapour pressure and moisture content, accounting for the multiple timescales at which different methods of sorption and transportation occur, and the effect of unsteadystate relative humidity, as is typical in walls insitu.  These factors would change the equilibrium moisture content compared to the steady relative humidity used in the cup methods and in pressureplateteststypicallyusedtodefinethemoisturestoragefunction. HÃ¥kansson (1998) has also described a retarded sorption effect at high relative humidities, which when not modelled with a dynamic sorption curve leads to simulations over estimating the penetration of 12

moisture through wood.  HÃ¥kansson monitored the adsorption, desorption, and periodic sorption behaviour of small wood samples under a variety of conditions, including at different relative humidity levels, and step sizes of changes in relative humidity. An observation was made that moisture transport appeared to be blocked, or delayed, when a series of smaller relative humidity changes was used compared to larger changes.  He then developed a nonFickian model which described moisture conductance not just as a function of moisture content and vapour pressure gradients of the sample, as atraditionalFickiantransportwouldbe,butalsoasafunctionthevapourpressuregradientraisedtothe powerofanempiricalvaluedenotinghowstrongthenonlinearlyoftheparticularsampleis. As the weakness in the WUFI model for wood is most evident at moisture contents well above 20%, which is outside the range a typical, well performing wall assembly is expected to experience, efforts to refinethemodelbecomeascientificexerciseinimprovingtheknowledgeofthehygrothermalbehaviour ofwoodinextremeconditions.
2.6 Conclusion of Review

Based on the literature reviewed, it is clear that there are known limitations to hygrothermal modelling of wood at high moisture contents.  There has also been little work done to evaluate the field performance of crosslaminated timber, as previous work has principally depended on laboratory measurements, which may have masked some of the inaccuracies in modelling programs. Therefore, a field experiment designed to evaluate the performance of wetted panels in a variety of wall assemblies will provide a valuable source of data which may help in beginning to address this knowledge gap. Locating the experiment in a climate representative of many of the populated regions in Canada will allow the results of testing to be applied when developing new guidelines for building envelope design containingcrosslaminatedtimber. The following work was designed to determine whether wetted CLT panels were capable of drying in a reasonable time period in a variety of wall assemblies in a southern Ontario climate, and whether a WUFImodeliscapableofpredictingsimilarbehaviourtothefielddata.

Chapter 3 - Experimental Setup and Procedure
3.1 Description of Wall Assemblies

To evaluate the hygrothermal performance of CLT wall assemblies, a test wall measuring 2.6 m Ã 2.6 m was constructed in a field exposure building envelope test facility in Waterloo, Ontario.  The test wall comprises sixteen 0.6 m Ã 0.6 m CLT panels, each composed of one of five types of wood species, in combination with two types of water resistant barrier, and two types of insulation, chosen to provide threedifferentmagnitudesofvapourpermeance,ordryingpotential. Thewallassembliesweredesignedbasedonthe"perfectwall"principles(Lstiburek,2007),includingthe structural CLT panels on the interior, followed by the rain water, air, and vapour control layer acting as a drainage plane behind the protective outer thermal control layer. The drainage planes behind the insulation werecreated usingselfadhesivewaterresistantmembranes.Anonvapourpermeable(NVP) water resistant membrane was used for the low exterior permeance wall configuration, and a vapour permeable (VP) membrane was chosen for the medium and high permeance wall assemblies.  These membranes were chosen since their ability to be fully adhered to wood would reduce potential air leakageadjacenttothewettedCLTpanelsandfocustheexperimentontheimpactofvapourpermeance of the assemblies.  Rigid board type insulation was used since it encouraged the use of continuous insulation, and its structural properties allowed the strapping to be screwed through the insulation board,intotheCLTpanels,andsupportthecementfibreboardsidingwhilecreatinga19mmdeeprain screen cavity.  Mineral wool insulation board was used as the vapour permeable insulation, and expandedpolystyrene(EPS)insulationboardwaschosenfortherigidsemivapourpermeableinsulation. The two types of insulating boards were both 76 mm thick, with the mineral wool providing a thermal resistance of 2.22 m2K/W, and the EPS providing RSI 2.1 m2K/W.  All assemblies were built with an interiorairspaceandgypsumdrywall.Theairspacewasprovided,bothtoallowservicesinthewall,and becauseawoodframewasusedtosupportthesmall scaleCLTpanelsinthe testwall.The depthofthe air cavity varied to allow for different thickness of CLT panel, while maintaining a constant plane for the installation of gypsum board at the interior wall surface.

As a result four categories of wall assemblies were studied: three having high, medium, or low vapour permeance materials outside of the CLT panels, respectively, but all having an unobstructed wall cavity totheinteriorofthe panelsandallowingthem tofreelydry totheinterior.Thefourth categoryhadthe medium permeance construction on the exterior but with a polyethylene sheet on the interior of the panels, creating a low interior permeance condition.

3.2 Description of Wood Species

The four Canadian wood species or species groups included are Western SPF, black spruce, Eastern SPF, and hemfir. The test also included a European CLT product with European spruce as a reference. Four samples each for Western SPF, European spruce, and black spruce were tested, one for each wall permeance category. Two hemfir samples were tested with the low and medium exterior permeance wall assemblies, and two Eastern SPF panels were tested with the high exterior and low interior 15

permeance wall assemblies. The Eastern SPF species group was composed largely of black spruce, although the manufacturing methods differ so they are treated as a separate category for this experiment. The Western SPF, Eastern SPF, and hemfir CLT panels were manufactured in a Vancouver laboratory specifically for this test wall, and included five laminations totalling 130 mm in thickness. The European spruce CLT panels were a commercial product from Europe, made of three layers and totalled 89 mm in thickness,withtheedgesoflumberboardsglued.TheblackspruceCLTpanelswerecommerciallymade in Quebec and consisted of three layers, totalling 102 mm in thickness.

3.3 3.3.1 Wetting Protocol Wetting Period

Since this study aimed to investigate the wetting and drying behaviour of CLT, one of the key experimental parameters that should be defined was the level of moisture to be introduced to the panelsbeforeconstructionofthetestwall. Initially, WUFI models were created to determine feasible levels of builtin moisture which may be obtained through climatic exposure, and how to replicate those levels through submersion.  The 1D WUFI simulations were performed using the builtin material properties provided in WUFI by the Fraunhofer IBP for a 128mm thick 3ply crosslaminated panel. No special consideration was made for the adhesive layers, as is consistent with models in the literature.  A wetted profile was developed by exposing the horizontally oriented, unprotected panels to Vancouver weather conditions on both sides for six months starting in December, the beginning of the rainy season.  The panel was initially set to 16

have a 14% moisture content, and no absorption or emission of radiation was allowed to eliminate the effect of sunlight.  A maximum possible moisture content profile was developed based on the highest moisture content attained at any point in the year at each location, mirroring the maximum profile for each face. The MC profile, shown in Figure 3.2 was then used as the initial condition for models of the fourwallassembliestobeusedintheexperiment.

During the simulated natural drying after such a maximized wetting, the MC at the pin locations over timecanbeseeninFigures3.3to3.6.Overall,themodelsindicatedthatthelengthoftimerequiredfor the MC to drop below 20% across the whole panel was 4 weeks for high permeance, 13 weeks for medium, 59 weeks for low, and 80 weeks for low interior permeance.  According to the simulation resultsobtainedthroughtrailanderror,inordertoreplicatetheinitialwettedprofilecausedbyweather exposure through immersing the panels in water, a possible scenario required that the panels be submersed for 4 days, dried for 3, then wetted for another 2 days in order to obtain a MC profile which penetrated deep enough in the panel without being too high at the face.  Wetting was simulated by modelling the panel exposed to constant rainfall at a rate of 99mm/hour, and the length of time for wetting and drying was manually adjusted until the resulting water content profile in kg/m3 fell within 5%oftheprofileobtainedthroughenvironmentalexposure.

Parallel laboratory testing of the same types of CLT panels was also being conducted by Lepage (2012), monitoringthewettinganddryingbehaviourofthepanelsalone.Theresultsofthesetestsshowedthat hygrothermal modelling for CLT based on the existing model and knowledge drastically underestimated boththerateofwateruptakeandthedryingspeed. Since the purpose of this field test was to investigate the drying potential of the CLT wall assemblies, it was imperative that the panels start in a sufficiently wetted state so that differentiation between wall assemblies or wood species could be detected.  Since there would be a period of about three days between the start of panel installation and the connection of all the sensors to the datalogger, and the laboratory testing showed significant drying would occur in this timeframe for the CLT panel, a decision was made to wet the panels to an extreme level in an attempt to ensure the panels would still be wet when the data collection commenced. A period of one week, with the panels immersed in water, was chosen, as data from Lepage (2012) showed that within that time period the moisture content of the panels with a water source on one surface had risen above 30% MC penetrating up to at least 40mm in depth.
3.3.2 Wetting Method

The edges of each CLT panel were sealed in advance with polyurethane paint in order to ensure water absorption and drying in the thickness direction only.  Testing of this sealing method is detailed in AppendixB.Thepaintwasallowedtodryforatleasttwoweeksbeforesubmersion.Theoriginalintent was to wet both sides of CLT for seven days to study the impact of the assembly permeance on the drying behaviour of both the exterior and interior of CLT assemblies. Therefore, data could be collected

fromtheexteriorfaces,wherethepermeanceofthewallmaterialsisvaried,andfromtheinteriorfaces, where the panels are relatively free drying to the interior air space, and the variation in behaviour betweenthedifferentspecies,andthesamplesofthesamespeciesmaybeanalyzed. A large children's swimming pool was used for wetting, as shown in Figure 3.7. The panels were placed in the pool in five stacks, with spacers between the pool floor, and each of the panels. Bricks were then stacked on top of the panels to act as ballast as the pool was filled with water.  Unfortunately, the advertised water depth in the pool could not be obtained. The panels on the tops of the stacks were initially covered in water when wetting began, but the pool leaked water overnight until the water level stabilisedabouthalfwayupthetoppanelofeachstack.Asthepoolwassetupinthetestfacility,which hasnoplumbing,theamountofwateravailableforwettingwaslimited.Consequentlyonefaceofsome panels was left exposed to the air with only the lower face immersed. These panels were marked, and the improperly wetted faces were placed where their drying conditions were closely replicated elsewhere,usuallyastheinteriorfreelydryingfaceoftheassemblies.

The Western SPF, Eastern SPF, and Hemfir panels were mounted directly onto a stud frame. The black spruce panels and the European spruce panels were less thick, and therefore were mounted onto the frame with spacers at the screw locations, allowing the exterior faces of all the CLT panels to align. This arrangement created interior vertical cavities aligning with each of the four wall assembly types, which were relatively open to each other at the top.  While the stud frame was necessary for this unconventional test wall made of many smaller panels, in typical construction this cavity may not be necessaryorcouldbeusedtoaccommodateserviceswithinthewall. The panels are separated from each other by a layer of spray polyurethane foam with a thickness of about 13 mm, in addition to the polyurethane paint used to seal the edges during wetting.  The wall opening of the test facility for accommodating the entire CLT test wall was lined with a layer of polyisocyanuratefoamboardinsulationandplywood,wrappedintheNVPwaterresistantmembrane.
3.5 3.5.1 Sensor Configuration Sensor Specifications

Three types of sensors were used in the test wall to measure relative humidity, temperature, and moisturecontent. The relative humidity and temperature components were provided by Honeywell and assembled into sensor packages by Building Science Consulting Inc. The relative humidity sensors were powered with 5V, grounded, and the voltage reading provided by the signal lead was converted using provided calibration coefficients and a linear relationship into a relative humidity reading.  The HIH4000 series sensors provide an RH reading within Â±3.5% accuracy. The accuracy of the RH sensors is reduced when exposedtohumidityabove95%forextendedperiodsoftime.Thereadingremainshighforanextended periodaftertherelativehumiditydecreases. The 10k NTC thermistors were excited with 2.5V, and the signal lead was read across a 1k resistor in parallel with the thermistor. The signal was converted to a temperature reading using a provided logarithmic relationship. The 192 series discrete thermistors provide an accuracy of Â±0.2Â°C. Individual thermistorswereusedwithintheCLTpanelstomeasuretemperature. The RH sensors were provided coupled with a temperature sensor in a vapour permeable water repellentpackage. The moisture content sensors used within the CLT panels consisted of pairs of nails coated in non conductive ceramic paint up to the tip.  The nails were inserted into the wood approximately 25mm 22

apart, along the grain of the wood, at differing depths.  The voltage supplied by the data acquisition systems power supply, approximately 13V, was applied across the MC pins in the wood and the voltage was read across a 10k resistor in series with the MC pins in the wood.  The average of 10 voltage readings lasting 20ms each was taken and converted to find the resistance of the wood. If the average voltagereadingwaslowenoughsuchthatresistanceofthewoodwasfoundtobehigherthan8000M, around 0.02mV, the value was filtered out as data logger is not sufficiently accurate to read such low values. This corresponds to moisture contents below 11%, so is not a point of concern when evaluating moisturerelateddurabilityconcerns.Theseresistancevalueswereconvertedtowoodmoisturecontent percentage values using Eq.

Sensor Layout

Moisture content pins, thermistors, and relative humidity (RH) sensors were installed across the wall assemblies to monitor the behaviour of the CLT panels. RH and temperature were measured in each of the four exterior vented cavities and interior air spaces, and between the weather resistant barriers and insulationforeachoftheCLTpanels.Intotal24combinedRHandTsensorswereused.Sevenmoisture content pins were placed in each CLT panel, located in the middle of the panels, 19 mm in from each face, 13 mm in from each face, and 6 mm in from the exterior face, except for the low interior permeance panels, where the 6 mm depth moisture measurement was taken from the interior face. Three additional thermistors per panel were inserted in the middle of each panel and 13 mm from each face. There were three more thermistorsfor the whole wall, two on the back of the fibre cement board sheathing, and one inserted 3mm into the interior side of the gypsum board.

Chapter 4 - Results Analysis and Discussion This chapter details the short and long term drying behaviour at the faces of the CLT panels due to the effects of the different wall assemblies, then discusses differences which can be seen between species groups. Data was collected, stored, and downloadable onsite.  Unfortunately, after some time, some data intervals were found to be missing after retrieval.  This was caused by a faulty outlet being used in combination with a failure of the datalogger's power supply batteries. Fortunately four full days' data wascollectedatthebeginningoftheexperiment,whenthewoodwasdryingquickly,showingthemajor differences between the panels, in addition to the majority of the data after the initial quick drying phase,whenthepanelmoisturecontentcontinuedtochange,thoughmoreslowly.
4.1 4.1.1 Short Term Drying Behaviour Freely Drying Interior

InordertodeterminewhetherwoodspecieshasasignificanteffectonthedryingbehaviourofCLT,most of the panels were constructed with no vapour diffusion retarders impeding drying into the interior wall cavity.  Given the same drying conditions, any significant difference in behaviour among panel species shouldbeevident. The moisture content at 13mm into the interior face of the freely drying panels is plotted in Figure 4.1. While the panels had different moisture content levels ranging between 14% and 24% when data collectionbegan,therateofdryingdidnotappeartovarygreatlybetweenthedifferentspeciesafterthe first three weeks. The rates of moisture content change appeared to be relatively constant between these samples, except panels C3 and D3. Both panels had the medium permeance wall materials on the exterior. The panel C3, made of Western SPF, was the panel with the highest MC at the start of data collection and dried at a faster rate than all the other panels, despite being located within the same MC range. The readings for panel D3 were an error, as the moisture content readings seemed to indicate the panel was behaving as if it had polyethylene sheeting on the interior face, when in fact, not only was there no sheeting, but the interior surface was not even wetted before construction. Upon further investigation, iswasevidentthatthevaluesrecordedforthewoodresistanceforthemoisturecontentpinsinpanelD3 were the exact same values, shift over one location as the reading for panel E4.  This error was likely causedbyirresolvableanomalousbehaviourofthedataloggerasnoprogrammingorwiringerrorscould

27

be found to explain it.  As a result, the results for moisture content for panel D3 have been excluded fromtheremainderofanalysis. In the samples which started with higher MC, especially above 20%, the drying rate appeared to be faster, probably due to the higher proportions of free water in cell lumens than the bound water in cell walls.Sinceneitherallthemediumexteriorpermeancepanels,noralltheWesternSPFpanelsdriedata faster rate than the remainder of the panels, it seemed likely that the faster drying rate was caused by special variations and irregularities in the specific wood samples tested, and may not be indicative of significant variations between wood species. No single species was consistently wetter than another at thebeginningofdatacollectionandaftertwomonths,10ofthe12moisturecontentreadingsfallwithin 1% of each other between 12% and 13% MC, which is negligible considering the Â±2% error inherent in the sensor reading. The species may have a larger effect on total moisture absorbed, or the depth of penetration of the elevated moisture content, but not the actual rate of drying of intercellular water molecules. The relative consistency in behaviour between the freely drying interior CLT faces suggests that when at a low initial moisture content, and allowed to dry freely, wood species is not a significant factor which will affect the choice of which CLT panels to choose for a construction project from a hygrothermal perspective. This conclusion is made based on the wood species included in this research, which is very representative of the range of Canadian softwood lumber species.  The results may differ when examining wood at higher moisture contents, or wood species that are much more permeable than the species included in this project, such as southern pine.  Also, it appeared that the panels were thick enough that the drying behaviour of the exterior and interior panel faces was not noticeably influenced by each other in the initial drying phases. For example, the interior faces of the panels were not drying moreslowlywhentheexteriorfacewasexposedtoalowpermeancematerialormorequicklywhenthe exteriorfacewasexposedtoahigherpermeancematerial.

Low Interior Permeance

The panels with polyethylene sheeting on the interior face showed slightly less uniform behaviour, especiallyinthefirstfewdaysofrapiddrying,asseeninFigure4.2.TheEuropeanpanel,A4,driedmore quickly than the others initially, which may indicate that liquid transport occurred more readily, redistributing moisture into the centre of the European panels when drying to the free surface was dramatically slowed.  The rate in decline of MC for panel C4, the Western SPF panel, is extremely low comparedtotheotherthreepanelsaftertheinitialdryingphase. The MC in all the low interior permeance panels remained at a very high level, with only two panels dropping significantly below 26% after two months.  While it was expected that the low interior permeance panels be the worst performing hygrothermally, with the highest risk of damage due to moisture, this measured data indicates the possibility that the moisture content does not redistribute quickly enough to the centre of the panels, sufficiently lowering the MC in the outer layers in a fast enoughtimeframetosafelypreventmouldandrot.

An additional point of concern for wood durability is the possibility of mould growth on the surface at a relative humidity above 80%. For the panels with low permeance materials adjacent to them, the RH sensors were not placed directly on the wood surface, they were placed between the nonvapour permeable membrane and the insulation for the exterior low permeance panels, and in the interior 31

cavity for the low interior permeance panels.  However, at the time of installation, extensive condensation was present on the polyethylene sheet, held against the face of the low interior permeance panels, as shown in Figure 4.5. Given the slow rate of drying, it is likely that the RH on the surface of the panel remains well above 80%, even after two months.  The same elevated relative humidity islikely present onthepanelswithlowexteriorpermeance, though theopaquevapourbarrier masks condensation and mould growing on the exterior face of the CLT panel.

Drying on the Exterior Face

TheMCrecordsfortheexteriorfaceoftheCLTpanelsdemonstratethatthepermeanceofthematerials adjacent is a principal factor in the drying behaviour of the wetted panels.  Due to the drying that occurred during construction, before installation of the insulation, many of the panels with a vapour permeablewaterresistantbarrierhadalreadydriedtobelow26%MCbeforethestartofdatacollection. When data collection began, the panels which had the nonvapour permeable water resistant barrier or polyethylene sheeting applied shortly after being removed from the wetting pool all have moisture contents in the covered faces of at least 20%, and usually well above the 26% required to initiate wood decay.  The vapour retarding membranes applied prevented these panels from drying during construction as the panels with vapour permeable membranes did. Since the application of the vapour control layer is the only difference in the treatment of the panels, it is reasonable to assume that all the panels were wetted to at least 26% in the outer layers in the wetting pool.  Comparing this assumed initialmoisturecontenttothemoisturecontentsatthestartofdatacollection,itbecomesclearthatthe majorityofdryingoccurredduringthetimebeforetheinsulationwasinstalled.Themajorityofthehigh

Although the RH for panels with both freely drying interiors and low permeance interior are included, the variation in RH is larger between panels of different wood species than between the two wall assemblies and the neither wall assembly produces an RH that is consistently higher than the other. The two panels with the highest RH levels are both made of Western SPF, which may indicate a difference in behaviour between CLT panel wood species groups, which might be

35

attributed to changes in material properties caused by blue stain fungus.  Due to the medium vapour permeance of the EPS insulation, the relative humidity adjacent to the panel is very stable compared to the RH in the same location for the high exterior permeance wall assemblies shown in Figure 4.8.

Long Term Hygrothermal Behaviour Typical Moisture Content Profiles of Drying Panels

Byexaminingthemoisturecontentprofileofeachpanelovertime,itbecomesclearthatthemajorityof drying occurs within the first month after installation.  Graphs of the moisture contents at each pin location for each panel over 12 months are available in Appendix E, moisture content profiles for all panels are included in Appendix F, and the exterior temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation data is shown in Appendix G.  The moisture content profiles for the European CLT panels with high, medium, and low exterior permeance, and for the black spruce panels for low interior permeance demonstrate typical drying behaviour for each wall type. The profiles are plotted with the exterior side of the panels on the left. Tables of data will show the moisture content trends at the wettest moisture pin location for all the panels over time, excluding panel D3 for erroneous readings. Moisture content readings above 26%, at risk of decay, will be highlighted in red, and readings above 20%, low risk of decay,buta benchmarkforsafety,willbe highlightedinorange tohelpidentifypanelswhicharewetter, ordryingmoreslowlythanothers. As a point of reference, the moisture content profiles of the nonwetted European CLT control panel is provided in Figure 4.12. The panel is in equilibrium with its environment at around 10 to 13% moisture content, fluctuating the most at the exterior face in response to changes in the outdoor relative humidity. The interior face also steadily dries 23% MC over the course of the year, which is consistent withthedropintherelativehumidityoftheinterioraircavityfromaround55%RHtoaround50%RH. 37

Medium Exterior Permeance

The medium exterior permeance panels have a higher initial moisture content at 19 mm from the exterior CLT surface compare to the high permeance panels.  The wettest panels do initially have moisture contents above 26%, however , they dry well below that level in the first month. Similarly to the high exterior permeance panels, the medium exterior permeance panels have very little change in moisture content after 4 months, indicating they are in equilibrium with their environment, though at a slightlyhigherMClevel.Thepanelshavealldriedbelow26%MCwithinamonth.

When data collection commenced, the interior, free drying face had already lowered to a safe moisture content around 15%.  Over time, the interior face of these panels lowered to a moisture content 2 to 3% higher than the high permeance panels. The slight elevation in moisture content at the interior face, as well as the unchanging moisture content in the centre of the panel is likely caused by moisture from the exterior face drying through the panel to the interior. While panel A1 reaches a MC below26%afteronemonth,dryingslowsbetween 4and7months,during colderweather, andpicksup again between 7 and 10 months.

Considering the moisture content 19 mm from the exterior face of all four panels with low exterior permeance, all the panels still have moisture contents at or above 20% MC after 7 months, with little change from the 4 month mark. Panel C1 remains around 25% MC after 7 months, and only drying a further 3% after a year, despite having the lowest initial reading, causing a risk of decay initiation due to the extended time frame at this elevated moisture content. While most of the panels dry to a safe level

Differentiation Between Species

Based on the drying data collected two trends can be identified which may indicate a differentiation in hygrothermal behaviour between wood species.  First, the European spruce panels, A1 to A4, tend to have a higher initial moisture content than the other panels. While the black spruce panels, B1 to B4, fall in the same wood genus as the European, or Norway, spruce, the black spruce wood is generally known to be among the least permeable wood species, and it comes from managed forest, while the European spruce was grown on a rapid growth tree plantation.  Plantation wood tends to be more porous than its more slowly grown counterpart from managed forests or old growth (Calkins, 2009), whichcanalsoleadtofastermoistureuptake. The second trend is in the slower drying configurations, the western SPF panels, C1 to C4, tend to dry moreslowly,especiallyincoolerweather,wheninitiallyatahighermoisturecontent.Theirbehaviouris not significantly different from the other species in medium or high permeance configurations, where theirmoisturecontentstartsbelow20%.Sincethesepanelsaremanufacturedfrompinebeetleinfected wood abundant in western Canada, and readily available to be used in CLT production, special attention may need to be paid to ensure the panels are not extraneously wetted at the time of construction, and to ensure proper building envelope design to improve the durability performance. McFarling (2006) has shown that bluestained pine beetle infested wood picks up more moisture, faster than unaffected

44

wood,thoughthemoistureuptaketestingperformedbyLepage(2012)onpanelsfromthesamesources as the field testing experiment showed that the panels did not have significantly different water absorptioncoefficients,withthewesternSPF,Europeanspruce,andhemfirpanelsallhavingavaluesof 12 g/m2.s1/2. However, this value is elevated from the typical range for softwoods of 17g/m2.s1/2 in the transversedirection(FPL,2010).

Chapter 5 - WUFI Model Verification The field study has provided data demonstrating how wetted cross laminated timber panels dry within four wall configurations of varying vapour permeances in a Southern Ontario climate.  In order to estimate the behaviour of the panels in different wall assemblies or climates, it is necessary to use the measured data to validate a hygrothermal simulation under the same conditions before extrapolating the model to new assemblies or different climatic conditions.  The following is a description of the materialpropertiesandsimulationinputsusedintheWUFIPro4.2modelsofthetestwall.
5.1 CLT Material Properties

The material properties used to model the CLT panels were derived from recommendations made after water uptake tests at the University of Waterloo (Lepage, 2012), and of ASTM testing at Carlton University (NRC, 2012).  Both sets of laboratory testing were performed on CLT panels from the same manufacturerandmaterialsourcesastheCLTsamplesusedinthetestwallofthisproject. Using the preexisting 3ply cross laminated panel material properties provided in WUFI as a base, the recommendationsfromLepage(2012)wereasfollows:

x

Calibrate the moisture storage function (MSF) to the sample density and set the saturated and referencemoisturecontentvaluesequaltothoseprovidedinthesorptionisotherm.Thisstepis only necessary because WUFI defines the MSF based on water content in kg/m3 instead of as a percentageofthetotalmass.

x

Set water absorption coefficient, Avalue, to the values found through laboratory water uptake tests.AllowWUFItoautomaticallygeneratetheliquiddiffusivityforsuction(DWS)basedonthis value.

x

Settheliquiddiffusivityforredistribution(DWW)at70%MCto100m2/sandcalibratetheslope at a value at 10 kg/m3 lower than the value at 70% MC. The value of 1e4, as found by Lepage (2012),wasused.

The rationale for the modifications to the liquid diffusivity for redistribution by Lepage (2012) is as followsinTable5.1.

An average A value of 0.012 kg/m2.s1/2 was applied toallthesepanels,aswellastheblack spruce panelswhichwerenot testedbutareinthe samespecies genus as the European spruce panels, in order to simplify the material properties for future use.  The eastern SPF panels had a significantly lower average A value of 0.005 kg/m2.s1/2. The A values found by Lepage by testing approximately 600mm x 600mm, full thickness panels are around a magnitude higher than the values found by the NRC (2012) ranging between 0.0017 and 0.0025 kg/m2.s1/2 for panels from thesamesources.TheNRCvalueswerefoundbytestingsmaller,100mmx50mmsamples,cutto25mm thickinsuchawaytoincludeagluelayer,whichlikelyresultedinthewettingsurfacebeingfreshlysawn, unlike the typically exposed surface of full size panels.

The laboratory measurements taking during water uptake testing are compared to simulations using the preexisting 3ply cross laminated panel material properties provided in WUFI with a low A value (3ply CLT Baseline), and the results when the material properties are corrected for density and the measured, higher, A value (3ply Corrected).  The increase in A value has the greatest impact on wetting of the panel, as the WUFI models of the test wall showed little difference between the use of the larger and smallerAvaluesduringdrying.

TheinitialvalueforinWUFIfor3ply crosslaminatedpanels,whichwasalsousedbyLepage(2012),is 203, translating to a permeability of 0.92 ng/m.s.Pa.  However, it is possible to input a moisture dependant water vapour diffusion resistance factor profile with respect to relative humidity, which accounts for the higher permeability of wood at higher RH levels. Therefore, the profile based on the averagevaluesfoundinwetanddrycupwatervapourpermeabilitytestingcompletedbytheNRC(2012)

was used, shown in Table 5.6, and is the same for all wood species. While at higher water contents the use of the humidity dependant water vapour diffusion resistance factor compared to the constant value produced little change in drying behaviour, indicating the dominance of liquid diffusion, some improvements were made in the agreement of the model for low moisture contents. For comparison, Figures 5.1 and 5.2 show the results of WUFI simulations for panel A2, with the high permeance wall assembly,withaconstantof203,andthemoisturedependantvalues,respectively.

Panel Initial Moisture Content

The initial panel moisture content profiles were set to match the initial values collected when data acquisition commenced.  In order to facilitate extraction of data allowing the moisture content of the panel at each exact sensor location to be found, the simulation file divided the CLT panel into multiple layers, with 1mm wide slices present at the sensor locations.  After some trial and error, in order to prevent the moisture contents in these slices from rising or falling sharply initially, rather than linearly extrapolating the moisture content between pin locations, the measured MC was applied for the entire section of panel between the face of the panel, the mid points of the pin locations, and extended 6mm into the centre of the panel. The initial moisture content profile for B1 is provided in Figure 5.3 as an example.  While likely not an exact replicate of the complete moisture content profile, this method providedbetterresultsthanifthemoisturecontentslopechangedsuddenlyateachpinlocation.

The hourly values for temperature, relative humidity, global solar radiation, rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction where measured locally with the preexisting test hut instrumentation. When gaps were present due to instrumentation error, they were filled with the average temperature and relative humidities measured intheexterioraircavitiesofthetestwallsincetheaircavityiswellventilated.Furtherdatagapsaswell as the necessary data for rainfall, solar radiation, and wind speed and direction, were filled with values providedbytheOntarioClimateCentre,measuredatastationinWaterloo,Ontario.

The properties of the insulation and WRBs within the wall assembly were set to match the properties specified by the manufacturers, in Appendix A. Other materials were set as to the WUFI properties in the North American database.  The wall assemblies were modelled including the exterior ventilated cavity and cement fibreboard cladding, and the ventilation rate in the cavity was set to 200 air changes perhourtosimulateawellventedcavity,aswasconstructed.

The simulation results for the High exterior permeance panels are in generally good agreement with the fielddata.TheWUFIresultsareusuallynomorethan2or3%MCdifferentthanthepinmeasurements, and when different, tend to overestimate the moisture content. The two notable deviations are the overestimate of up to 5% of the moisture content in the centre of panel A2 and the lack of reactivity of the moisture pins deeper into the exterior face to the exterior RH changes.  The overestimate of the moisture content in the centre of the panel may be associated with a deviation in the initial moisture contentprofilecomparedtotherealpanel.Sincethedifferencecausesanoverestimateofthemoisture content,whichisalreadyatalowlevel,itisnotamajorpointofconcern.Thesecondpointatwhichthe simulationdiffersconsiderablytothefieldmeasurementsisthelackofresponseofthesimulationmodel at 13 and 19mm in from the exterior face to the exterior RH changes compared to the measured data.

Low Exterior Permeance

In the simulations of the low exterior permeance panels, WUFI predicts the moisture content at the interior freely drying face very well. In two of the panels, A1 and B1, WUFI predicts that the centre of the panel will raise by 5 to 8% moisture, which is not reflected in the measure data, and also predicts a slower initial drying rate at the locations with extremely high moisture content at the exterior face. While this underestimate of drying is conservative, it may be caused by an inaccurate estimation of initial moisture contents at the exterior face inputted into the simulation as the moisture pins become considerably less accurate over 30% MC. The rate of drying appears to be similar after the third month attheinteriorface. In panel C1, WUFI over predicts drying at the exterior face, predicting a MC of around 21% when the field measurements indicate levels close to 25%.  Furthermore, the field measurements show little drying after three months, and combined with a similar phenomena in panel C3, this may indicate that thematerialpropertiesofwesternSPFrequirefurtherinvestigationathighermoisturecontents.

The western SPF panels were simulated with the same parameters used for modelling the test wall assemblies aside from different weather files, and a more extreme initial moisture state.  The initial moisture contents were set at 30%MC at the faces of the panels, up to 25mm deep, and 15% MC in the centre of the panels.  The customised weather file reflectingtheactualconditionsexperiencedbythetestwallinWaterloowasreplacedwiththecoldyear 63

climate data provided in WUFI, for Vancouver or for Toronto. The interior conditions were not changed from the 21Â°C and 50% RH environment found inside the test hut facility. The simulation period was a two years, beginning in November. The results are plotted at the sensor locations in the centre of the panels,andatthepinsclosesttotheinteriorandexteriorfacesofthepanels. For the high exterior permeance panel the moisture contents at the central, and at the inner moisture pinarevirtuallyunchanged,seeninFigure5.20.Attheouterpin,wherethewoodismoreresponsiveto changes in the exterior environment, the variation in moisture content is larger, though the range in which the moisture contents is found is very similar.  In the winter months, there is no significant difference between the climates in the drying stage, with the Vancouver simulation showing moisture contents less than 1% higher than in Toronto. After drying to below 15%MC the difference increases to around1%MC,buthasnosignificanteffectonthemoisturedurabilityoftheCLTpanels.Inlatesummer the moisture content at the exterior face peaks in response to changes in the exterior conditions, at different times in each climate, but the magnitude of the peaks are similar, the increase in moisture contentisnotsustained,andthepanelsarenotatriskfordecay.

The notable exception is for panel C1, at the exterior face with low exterior permeance, The time untilthepanelhasdriesbelow20%MCinVancouveris15.3months,whileanadditional3.3monthsare required in Toronto. Drying is likely slower in Toronto because the lower outside temperatures increase theoverallvapourpressuredrivetowardstheexterior,slowingdryingtowardstheinteriorwhenthelow permeance exterior membrane is present.  Referring to Figure 5.22, it is apparent that this delay is caused by a considerable decline in drying rate during the second winter of the simulation, where the Toronto panel hovers around 21% MC , and the Vancouver panel hovers around 20% MC.  In both climates, the low exterior permeance panels spend an extended time above 20% MC, which indicates these panels are most likely to be at risk of decay initiation. However, such and extended drying time was not found in the results of the field test, which underlines the need for a more refined WUFI model athighmoisturecontents. The panels with medium exterior permeance take as much as 2 months to dry, though there is little apparent difference caused by the presence of the interior polyethylene sheet on the drying behaviour oftheexteriorface.Whilethistime periodisbelow thesixmonthsperiod expected tobenecessaryfor decay to initiate, it is still an indication that it is important to protect panels from excessive wetting on constructionsite.

Overall, the difference in drying behaviour caused by the variation in climate between Toronto and Vancouver is extremely small.  Aside from the low exterior permeance panel, when drying stagnates during the second winter in both climates, just above and just below 20%MC, there is no significant impact on the time required for wetted panels to dry, and differences are primarily evident where high permeancewallassembliesallowthepanelstomoredirectlyexperiencethevariationinexteriorrelative humidity,whenthepanelhasalreadydriedandisatequilibriumwithitsenvironment.

Chapter 6 - Conclusions The field study has provided an opportunity to determine the behaviour of wetted crosslaminated timber panels within a variety of wall assemblies, and to verify the behaviour of the hygrothermal modelsintheseextremecases. Themostimportantsummaryconclusionsare: x Elevated moisture contents which allow for future decay are not likely to be developed due to typicalenvironmentalexposuretomoistureonaconstructionsite. x Lowpermeancematerialssuchaspolyethylenesheetingandothernonvapourpermeablewater resistive barriers cause lower drying potential, and are unnecessary for good wall assembly design.  However, the field data shows these panels dried in sufficient time to prevent decay initiation. x Forpanellocationsabove15%moisturecontent,dryingcanslowduringthewinter,thenpickup againinsummer. x Further development of the hygrothermal model together with refined material properties are requiredtomoreaccuratelymodelwood. One of the first insights to come out of this study came during construction, when it was observed that the unprotected, wetted panels dried very quickly under typical southern Ontario summer conditions. While for this field test, this behaviour made it difficult to capture the initial drying phase, it does indicate that during a typical construction project, where efforts are made to protect wood on constructionsites,thehighestpossibleinitialmoisturecontentatthetimeofenclosureoftheCLTpanels due to accidental moisture exposure can be low enough to reduce potential durability problems under normal operating conditions. However, more work is required to determine the extent to which onsite exposure can cause excessive moisture accumulation under a variety of climates, and with different wood species, exposure times, and CLT manufacturing methods.  Overall, it seems unlikely that if reasonable measures are taken to protect cross laminated timber panels from wetting, construction moisturealoneisnotlikelytobeacauseoflongtermmoisturedurabilityissues. In terms of suitable wall assemblies, the use of high permeance envelope materials can effectively promotedryingofCLTpanels.

The medium permeance wall configurations are sufficiently vapour permeable to prevent moisture durability issues under normal circumstances with initially dry panels, though further investigation may beneededtodeterminethecauseofthemoisturecontentincreaseinPanelC3. Lowpermeancematerials,especiallytotheexterior,aretobeusedwithmorecaution,notonlybecause they prolonged the time period required for wetted panels to dry to a safe level in some cases, but also because the lack of steep rise in the moisture content in the centre of the panel, further indicates that the CLT panel itself is a good vapour retarder. Therefore any additional vapour barrier is unnecessary in a CLT assembly. While in the test wall, both the interior and exterior low permeance wall panels dried sufficientlyquicklytopreventdecayinitiation,thelowpermeancematerialmayhaveamoredeleterious effectifanincidentalmoisturesourceispresent,enablingariseoflocalmoisturecontentovertime. Finally, the wood species does not appear to have a significant effect on the drying rate of the CLT panels, though it appears as though the plantation grown European spruce panels tend to reach slightly highermoisturecontentswhenexposedtoongoingmoisturesources.
6.1 Further WUFI Calibration

The WUFI model used appears to correlate sufficiently well with the field measurements at moisture contents below 25% to predict general trends in the moisture content of the CLT panels.  This is the range at which the cross laminated timer is expected to be found when performing well.  Further refinement of the model is required to more accurately predict hygrothermal behaviour at moisture contentswherethereisaseriousriskofdecay. Above 25% moisture content WUFI both overestimates and underestimates the moisture content of the panels. Due to the extended period of time required for decay to initiate, this inaccuracy does not lead theusertobelievethatanypanelswhichhavefieldmeasurementsatriskfordecayarenotatriskafter6 months. However, as the effect of wetting at the end grain of the CLT panels was not included in this field study, and moisture uptake and penetration is likely to be higher if the edges are wetted, refinement of the hygrothermal model, or usage of an two dimensional modelling program may be requiredtomodelthesesituations. Further investigation may also be made into the cause of the tendency to predict less drying or even wettinginthecentreofthepanelswhichthefielddatadoesnotindicate,aswellasthelowreactivityto external relative humidity. These anomalies may be resolved with a different set of material properties intheexistinghygrothermalmodel,orwiththeuseofanalternatehygrothermalmodelforwood.

Appendix B - Edge Sealing Small scale testing was undertaken in order to verify the effectiveness of the paint used in sealing the edgesoftheCLT.SmallscrapesoftheEuropeanspruceCLTsampleswereused,approximately6"long,1 1/2" wide, and 3 Â½" thick. Four samples were used, three of which were painted on all six sides with three coats of Interlux Brightside onepart polyurethane finishing paint. The third sample was painted on the four cut edges, with a small border around the exposed faces of the CLT sample, in order to compare water uptake values with the completely covered samples.  Of the three completely sealed samples, one was steamed for 2.5 hours, and weighed every half hour, one was submerged in room temperature blue water for 5 days, and weighed every 24 hours, and one was kept in an enclosed space over room temperature water for five days, and weighed every 24 hours. The fourth sample was also submerged for 5 days, in the blue water, in order to determine the depth of liquid penetration into the CLT face. Room temperature was around 25Â°C. The four samples, and their testing conditions, may be seeninFiguresB.1toB.4,withtheirmassoverthecourseoftestingasindicatedingrams.

Combined with the placement of sensors towards the centres of the panels in the full scale experiment, painting the CLT panels appears to be a suitable method of sealing the edges before wetting. As seen in Figure B.6, in five days, the blue liquid water penetrated approximately 2 mm into thebarefaceofthesample,andthepaintedportionshowednopenetrationofdyedliquid.

This was the coldest time period recorded, and the values for heat flux, data logger panel (interior) temperature, and exterior temperature in this time period were used to determine the average measured Uvalues of the wall elements. For each element, the sum of the sampled heat flux values in February was divided by the sum of the sampled temperature differences. The composite stud wall U value was calculated simple by using the weight average areas of the stud and the cavity, considering 1.5" of stud for every 16". The measured U values are shown in Table D.2. While all the measured U values about twice as high as those calculated in THERM, it can be noted that while THERM predicted the stud wall would lose about 3% less heat than the CLT wall assembly, the measured values show the studwallhasinfactlost25%moreheatthantheCLTwall.

A more detailed view of the data collected during a clear week in March, shown in Figure D.2, allows an estimate of the time delay in peak flux through the CLT wall compared to the insulated portion of the stud wall.  The peaks in negative heat flux, out of the CLT wall, is typically delayed about 3 hours compared to the peak in heat flux out through the insulated cavity.
