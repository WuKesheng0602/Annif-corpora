Abstract
This thesis investigates the performance of ternary blends containing high calcium fly ash (HCFA) and slag against: sulfate attack, alkali-silica reaction (ASR), salt scaling, and freezethaw damage. In addition, compressive strength, permeability and fresh properties were

evaluated. In terms of sulfate attack, the performance of HCFA was significantly enhanced when slag was added to the mix, and the same was found for ASR. The high efficacy in resisting ASR of HCF A/slag blends was found to be a result of the blends' ability to bind and retain

alkalis. Regarding the salt scaling, the tested ternary concretes failed the Ministry of Transportation Ontario limit, 0.8 kg/m 2 ; however, enhanced performance was achieved when the samples were cured by wrapping with plastic sheets. Ternary blends achieved high resistance to freezing/thawing and less bleeding compared to those of the control mix without slag or HCF A; however, setting time was dragged by about an hour.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 1. Introduction 1.1 General

While in service, concrete experiences different durability issues. Among them, sulfate attack, alkali silica reaction (ASR), salt scaling and frost damage are few deterioration mechanisms that have gained significant attention in the past decades. The damage caused by these durability. issues lowers the serviceability and sometimes the load carrying capacity of concrete.

In

addition, they accelerate the deterioration of concrete by allowing aggressive chemicals to tngress.

Sulfate attack is mainly characterised by formation of ettringite while ASR is characterized by formation of expansive gel. Formation of ettringite due to sulfate attack and/or formation of silica gel due to ASR exert pressure and crack the concrete, leading to reduction in the load carrying capacity (Mindess et al.,2003). On the other hand, salt scaling causes·the spalling of the concrete surface due to the de-icing salt application coupled with freezing temperature. Salt scaling is known to reduce serviceability of flat works and it may also facilitate the ingress of other aggressive chemicals. Especially, corrosion can be a consequence of salt scaling as the chlorides easily penetrate through the eroded surface to attack the reinforcing steel bars (Mindess et al., 2003; Valenza and Scherer, 2007a,b,c). Finally, freeze-thaw damage is caused by the increase in volume as the water turns ice within concrete. The pressure exerted during the volume increase is sufficient to crack the concrete and to reduce the structural capacity. However, it is widely accepted that if the aggregates are not frost susceptible, then air

1

Chapter 1: Introduction entrainment is a successful protection for freeze-thaw damage as the entrained air provide room to relieve the hydraulic pressure (Mindess et al., 2003).

Available literature contains theories explaining the mechanisms for each of the above mentioned durability issues. For example, swelling and crystal growth theories accounts for

expansion of ettringite due to sulfate attack (Cohen, 1983); double layer theory explains the ASR gel expansion (Prezzi et al., 1997); and hydraulic and osmotic theories states reasons for frost/salt actions (Valenza and Scherer, 2007c; Mindess et al., 2003).

While few researchers tried to understand the mechanism of various durability issues, others have researched the material parameters of concrete to address those issues. For many decades, fly ash and slag are incorporated into concrete with the intention of enhancing the durability. This has been reported to be the case as fly ash and slag benefits the concrete from the physical and chemical standpoints (Mehta, 1986; Mindess et al., 2003; Monteiro et al., 1997; Tikalsky et al., 1990)

Fly ash is divided by Canadian Standards Association (CSA) into three categories: low calcium fly ash, moderate calcium fly ash, and high calcium fly ash. Low calcium fly ash is found to be very effective in reducing the damage from sulfate attack and alkali-silica reaction. The beneficial action of low calcium content fly ash is mainly due to pore refinement, Ca(OH)2 consumption, pore solution alkalinity reduction and alkali binding ability. High calcium content fly ash, on the other hand, is found to be not effective and the reasons are attributed to its higher alkali and calcium, and lower silica contents (Thomas et al., 1999).

2

Chapter 1: Introduction Slag is also widely used in order to control the deterioration issues at the appropriate replacement levels. Slag benefits through several actions including Ca(OH)2 consumption, pore solution alkalinity reduction, and lowering Ca/Si ratio of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate (C-S-H). of special importance in case of alkali silica reaction (Hooton, 2000). These are

In terms of salt scaling, contradictory results are available in the literature regarding the effects of supplementary cementing materials (SCM) on salt scaling. However,
~he

common view is The

that incorporating fly ash or slag increases the scaling at least in the laboratory run tests.

possible reasons includes excessive bleeding, improper surface finishing practices, lack of cunng, and formation of coarser microstructure due to carbonation (Valenza and Scherer, 2007a,b). With respect to frost damage, the slag or fly ash has shown to perform well if the concrete is adequately air entrained (Bilodeau et al., 1994; Hooton, 2000).

1.2

Objectives

This investigation is carried out to study the resistivity of concrete containing high calcium fly ash and slag against sulfate attack, alkali-silica reaction, salt scaling and frost damage. Earlier research work has shown high calcium fly ash to have low efficiency in resisting ASR and sulfate attack (Shehata, 2001; Thomas et al., 1999; Freeman and Carrasquillo, 1995; Shashiprakash and Thomas, 2001; Tikalsky et al., 1991 ). The main objective of this study is to enhance the performance of high calcium fly ash by incorporating slag. In addition to evaluating the performance of concrete with different levels of slag/fly ashes, the study looks into the mechanisms by which ternary blends of high calcium fly ash/slag affects the various deterioration mechanisms. Ion migration and calcium hydroxide consumption rates are

Chapter 1: Introduction investigated to reason out the performance of various binary and ternary blends of high calcium

fly ash and slag. For alkali-silica reaction, the alkali binding ability of binary and ternary blends
was studied using the flame photometer. For salt scaling test, different curing regimes were used to evaluate the effect of curing conditions, which might affect the degree of hydration, on scaling resistance. In addition to the durability issues, hardened and fresh properties of the ternary and binary blends were also evaluated. This research contributes to the understanding of synergy of high calcium fly ash and slag in ternary blends.

Chapter 2. Literature Review
This chapter reviews the existing literature on sulfate attack, ASR, salt scaling, frost damage, and the role of fly ash, slag on the durability issues.

2.1

Supplementary Cementing Materials
The

The two supplementary cementing materials used in this study are fly ash and slag.

materials properties of fly ash and slag, and their effects on plastic and hardened concrete are reviewed in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.

2.1.1

Fly Ash

Fly ash is derived from combustion of pulverized coal as a by product. Fly ash particles are spherical and ranges in size between 1 - 150 1-!m. Concrete with fly ash is more workable, requires higher air entrainment dosage to achieve the required air content, and reduces bleeding. Often, concrete with fly ash replacement results in reduced early strength and increased late strength compared to plain concrete (Berry and Malhotra, 1980).

Canadian Standard, CSA A23.5 classifies fly ash into three categories based on its calcium oxide content. Ashes with CaO < 8% is classified as Class F, ashes between CaO 8 and 20% is classified as class CI, and, ashes with CaO > 20% is classified as Class CH. Typical chemical

composition of class F ash is Si02 > 50%, Ah0 3 20 - 30%, Fe20 3 < 20, CaO < 5% and of Class CHis Si02 > 30%, Ah0 3 15-25%, Fe20 3 < 10, CaO = 20-30% (Mindess et al., 2003).

Chapter 2: Literature Review

High calcium fly ash contains lower silica, alumina and ferric oxide contents and higher calcium, sulphur and alkalis. Low calcium content fly ash contains calcium aluminosilicate (C-A-S) glass and virtually no crystalline compounds of calcium. High calcium fly ash contains C-A-S glass and crystalline compounds of calcium (Mehta, 1986). Due to the presence of C-A-S and

crystalline compounds of calcium, cementing properties of high calcium fly ash is preferable; in fact, high calcium fly ash produces higher early strength than the low calcium fly ash.

2.1.2

Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS)

GGBS (slag) is a by-product from iron making process and hence, the chemistry of slag depends on iron making process itself. Typical chemical composition of slag includes CaO = 35- 45%, Si02 = 32-38%, Ab03 = 8- 16%, Fe203 < 2%, and sulphur= 1-2%. Fineness of slag varies; and finer the slag grains, higher the rate of reaction due to higher surface area. Usually, slag is finer than the Portland cement it replaces. The specific gravity of slag is around 2.9. Concrete incorporating slag is easier to handle and finish as slag particles are finer than Portland cement. However, slag concrete often requires higher dosage of air admixtures to obtain similar air content as Portland cement concrete. Further, slag concrete may retard the initial and finial setting times compared to that of Portland cement concrete (Hooton, 2000; Mindess et al., 2003).

The hydration of slag concrete is very slow due to the presence of an amorphous coating around slag grains (Mindess et al., 2003). The rate of hydration of slag gets faster when it is activated with alkali compound. When slag is incorporated with Portland cement, alkalis and calcium hydroxide produced from hydration of Portland cement activates slag (Mindess et al., 2003).

6

Chapter 2: Literature Review The C-S-H produced from the reaction of slag is lower in Ca/Si ratio and is able to incorporate more alkalis (N a+ and K+) and Ab0 3 (Hooton, 2000).

Ternary Blends

In the past, attempts have been made to incorporate more than one SCM into concrete mixtures

to achieve synergetic effect. Combining two SCMs is thought to be beneficial if one could offset the shortfalls of other. For instance, when silica fume and fly ash are combined, the synergy

could be expected in terms of strength development, reduction in water demand, increased sulfate resistance, lower permeability, reduced heat release and, reduced cost. For example, silica fume would contribute for low early strength properties of fly ash while fly ash contributes to the long term strength development that silica fume lacks (Thomas et al., 1999). Thomas et al. (1999) observed significant improvement in performance of ternary blends containing silica fume and high calcium fly ash where their study showed ternary blends of silica fume and high calcium fly ash enhanced the early properties of concrete, ASR and sulfate resistance.

Dehuai and Zhao yuan ( 1997), Berry ( 1980), and Douglas and Pouskouleli ( 1991) reported compressive strength development of ternary blends containing low calcium fly ash and slag. Their results did not show any evidence of synergy in terms of strength development; rather, it seemed that the each SCM manifested their individual cementitious properties.

2.2

Concrete Durability

SCMs have been used to increase the resistance of concrete against durability issues. SCMs are known to increase the resistance through various actions including Ca(OH)2 consumption due to pozzolanic reaction, refining pore structure, diluting the reactive constituents such as C 3A in Portland cement, and incorporating alkalis and aluminum into C-S-H thus making them unavailable for the deteriorative reactions (Ramyar and Inan, 2007; Tikalsky and Carrasquillo,

8

Chapter 2: Literature Review 1992; Wee et al., 2000; Mindess et al., 2003; Hooton, 2000). The following parts of the

literature review involves the contribution of fly ash, slag and their combination to enhance concrete durability in terms of sulfate attack, ASR, salt scaling, and freeze-thaw damage. First, the overview and mechanism of each of these deterioration modes are presented followed by the effect of SCMs on each durability issues and the summary of widely used laboratory evaluation methods.

2.3

Sulfate Attack

In hardened concrete, alkali sulfate attack occurs through five different actions (Hime and Mather, 1999; Santhanam et al., 2001, 2003):

1. Ettringite formation 2. Gypsum formation 3. Thaumasite formation 4. Crystallization, and 5. Cycling from anhydrous sodium sulfate to dehydrate sodium sulfate

To illustrate the process of sulfate attack, a mortar cube could be exposed to Na2 S04 solution. Once the mortar came into contact with Na2S04 , the reaction between sodium sulfate, calcium and aluminates takes place and ettringite and gypsum form. The formed ettringite and, perhaps, gypsum expand, creating tensile force within the mortar. The expansive force induces cracking inside the mortar. Once the mortar is cracked, salt solution can easily penetrate to the core to react with the hydration products. The reaction products accumulate in the cracks and pores. The zones of accumulation extend further into the mortar as more reaction products form (Santhanam et al., 2003).

Chapter 2: Literature Review

Typical sources of sulfate in concrete are soil, water and cementing materials in the form of Na
2

so4 ,

K2 S04, MgS04, CaS04. For the sulfate ions from the external sources to migrate,

high permeability and presence of moisture are essential. The abovementioned five different forms of sulfate attacks are reviewed below.

2. 3.1

Ettringite Formation

Calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (ettringite) is a major factor causes deterioration of concrete due to sulfate attack. Ettringite could form in fresh concrete and hardened concrete. Ettringite formed in fresh concrete is called primary ettringite (Equation 1) and is harmless because the concrete is fresh and can accommodate the stress results from the expansion (Hime and Mather, 1999).

Other type of ettringite is formed in the hardend concrete, called secondary ettringite, (Equation 2) causes cracking and spalling as the non-uniform expansion exerts stress within the rigid concrete (Hime and Mather, 1999).

[Equation 2]

2.3.2

Factors Governing Secondary Ettringite Formation

The two essential factors for the secondary ettringite to form are high permeable concrete and presence of water within the concrete. The permeability has to be sufficient for the sulfate ions

to enter into the concrete from external sources and water must be available to carry the entering sulfate ions. In addition, pre-existing micro-cracks, higher cuing temperature (associated with 10

Chapter 2: Literature Review

certain cement types), and alkali content influence the formation of secondary ettringit1 (Collepardi, 2003; Escadeillas et al., 2007).

The role of pre-existing cracks are evident fron

high vulnerability of prestressed concrete structures to sulfate attack since higher localizel

stresses created when the pre-stressed cables were cut cause micro-cracks (Collepardi, 2003) Presence of microcracks allows water to penetrate more easily to leach the alkalis. When alkali

are removed faster, the secondary ettringite forms faster (Escadellias et al. , 2007). Often th concrete with high early strength cement and cured at elevated temperatures (above 70°C) result

in expansion due to secondary ettringite (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2 was obtained by curing morta

bars made up of Type 5 cement at various temperatures and 100% relative humidity (RH) for 2t

hours. Followed by the curing period, the specimens were stored in lime solution and periodi,

length measurements were taken. As in Figure 2.2, the specimens went through higher curin1

temperature expanded more than the ones with lower curing temperature. One school of though

that explains the secondary ettringite formation from higher heat curing is that when concrete i: cured at higher temperature, normal ettringite formation does not occur. Hence, highe concentration of sulfates in pore solution is sustained for longer period to result in

secondar~

ettringite formation ·(Ramlochan et al. , 2003). Another school of thought is that at higher hea

treatment, sulfates enter into C-S-H which is to be released later to form secondary ettringit1 (Ramlochan et al., 2003).

Increase in alkali content increases the risk of expansion since higher the alkali content give: higher rate of hydration for C3 S, which may increase the formation of secondary ettringit( (Escadeillas, 2007; Taylor, 2001 ). Another concept is that increase in alkali content increases th(

11

Chapter 2: Literature Review

e

pH of pore solution where higher pH of pore solution increases the sulfate content in C-S-H and
induces monosulfate formation rather than ettringite (Tayer et al., 2001; Escadeillas et al., 2007).

2.3.3

Expansion Mechanisms of Secondary Ettringite

In the literature, two theories have been proposed to explain the expansion mechanism for
t

secondary ettringite; one is crystal growth theory by Cohen and other is swelling theory by Mehta (Cohen, 1983). Cohen in his crystal growth theory stated that ettringite .crystallize and the thickness of ettringite crystals increases as more ettringite is formed. Once the thickness of the ettringite exceeds the thickness of surrounding solution, the ettringite exerts pressure on adjacent hydration product wall.

Mehta, on the other hand, suggested that the expansion is caused by swelling of ettringite particles by absorbing water. According to Mehta, ettringite crystals with smalJ specific area

12

Chapter 2: Literature Review will absorb little water and therefore, will not cause expansion. Mehta observed that concr1 with finer ettringite particles expand a lot compared to the ones with coarser ettringite. This obvious since finer particles have more surface area to absorb more water (Cohen, 1983). What is common in both theories are that size of ettringite particles affect the expansion a1 presence of lime, water and expansive materials results in smaller ettringite crystals, whe absence of lime results in larger ettringite crystals (if lime is not present, the aluminates reac faster and produces larger crystals), which don't expand significantly (Cohen, 1983).

2.3.4

Gypsum Formation

Formation of gypsum may not be a primary cause for immediate deterioration however it coul< be severe in the long run. And, no well defined mechanism is established for damage caused b)

gypsum formation (Tian and Cohen, 2000). Formation of gypsum is given by Equation 3 when calcium, sulfate, and water react to form gypsum.

[Equation 3]

Cement with increased C3S content is more vulnerable as it would hydrate faster to produce

more Ca(OH) 2 which would lead to increased gypsum formation. Tian and Cohen (2000) used

two types of cement; one with limited C3S (in Figure 2.3a, labelled "Alite") and other with

plenty of C3S (Figure 2.3b). In addition, samples were made with replacement of these two

cements with an SCM (silica fume). The specimens were soaked in 5% Na2 S04 and lime water.

The obtained results are shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3a shows the expansion of specimens

made with limited C3S content cement with and without SCM and soaked in Na2 S04 solution.

Figure 2.3a also contains the expansion of specimen made with limited C3S cement under lime

13

Chapter 2: Literature Review solution. After 1 year the specimen without the SCM (i.e. SF) expanded dramatically while the one soaked in limewater did not show any expansion. In Figure 2.3b, similar blends were made (but with cement rich in C3S) and submerged under Na2S04 and limewater. In Figure 2.3b, the

blend without any SCM (i.e. C3S-Na2S04) expanded dramatically after 1 month under Na2S04 solution but the same blend under limewater did not expand.

As Figure 2.3 shows, limited C 3 S cement (alite) specimens soaked in Na2S04 had the same expansion as the specimens soaked in lime water and specimens with SCM replacement until 1 year. On the other hand, C 3 S rich specimens soaked in Na2S04 showed distinguishable

In

addition to the expansion measurements, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis conducted on these specimens confirmed the presence of high gypsum peaks on Alite-Na2S04 specimen after 440 days and C3S-Na2S04 specimen after 220 days while less amount of gypsum were detected on specimens with SCMs. This study confirmed that formation of gypsum results in expansion.

This study also confirmed that incorporation of SCM to consume Ca(OH)2 for pozzolanic reaction will reduce the availability of Ca(OH)2 to form gypsum; and sufficient supply of C3S will induce early expansion as more Ca(OH) 2is formed due to rapid hydration (Tian and Cohen, 2000).

2.3.5.

Thaumasite Formation

The ettringite allows broad range of ions to substitute into its chemical structure. Thaumasite forms when such a substitution takes place in the structure of ettringite. substitute Al3+ In ettringite to result In a silica-based Si4+ trivalent ions thaumasite,

compound

2CaO·Si02·2CaS04·2CaC03 ·30H20.

In addition to sulfate, a source of CaC0 3 and water are

also essential for thaumasite. However, unlike ettringite, presence of alumina is not required for thaumasite. The source of CaC0 3 is could be internal or C02 from atmosphere (Bellmann and Stark, 2007). Cabonation would decompose C-S-H to initiate thaumasite formation (Brown, 2002; Mulenga et al., 2003). Beside CaC03, it was thought that lower temperatures as a condition for significant thaumasite formation; however, thaumasite was detected in higher temperatures as well (Brown, 2002). The study conducted by Mulenga et al. (2003) shows that sulfate tests performed at lower temperatures end up with more destruction than those at higher temperatures. Mulenga et al. (2003) made mortar bars 0, 20, 30, 40, and 50% replacement with

15

-

Chapter 2: Literature Review

fly ash. Those bars were soaked in N a2S04 solution and kept at 20°C and 8°C to study the
thaumasite formation. For the first 56 days, the bars at both temperatures showed similar level of expansion after which the bars at 8°C expanded dramatically. Further, the bars kept at 20°C sustained themselves even after 120 .days where the bars at 8°C became mushy and incohesive before 120 days. XRD investigations showed that specimens kept at 20°C showed mainly ettringite phases and no signs of thaumasite; and the specimens at 8°C showed mainly thaumasite phases. Their study confirmed the strong effect of temperature on formation of thaumasite and the more destruction that thaumasite brings than that of ettringite alone.

2.3.6

Crystallization

Salt crystallization occurs as the water evaporates from the salt solution. The crystallization is given by Equation 4 which occurs in concrete pores (Hime and Mather, 1999). [Equation 4] If the pores, where the crystallization occurs are located near the surface, the crystallization exerts pressure large enough to cause deterioration (Neville, 2004). Capillary action plays a significant role in salt crystallization. The sulfate from the soil could enter into the concrete by capillary action where concrete with finer pores and SCMs would be more vulnerable (Nehdi and Hayek, 2005).

In addition to crystallization, variations in temperature and humidity will cause the salt to change
between dehydrated to anhydrous forms as shown in Equation 5 (N ehdi and Hayek, 2005; Neville, 2004; Hime and Mather, 1999). [Equation 5]

16

Chapter 2: Literature Review The above reversible reaction (Equation 5) involves volume increase of around 315% which causes destructive pressure (Nehdi and Hayek, 2005).

Nehdi and Hayek (2005) tested the cylinders (made of three different w/c: 0.3, 0.45, and 0.6) partially soaked in salt solution and partially exposed to the atmosphere. Nehdi and Hayek intended to observe the efflorescence* deposit on the portion of concrete exposed to atmosphere. Specimen with 0.45 w/c gave higher efflorescence deposit than the ones with 0.6 and q.3 w/c. One would expect that lower w/c would give more efflorescence because of higher capillary suction. However, here moderate w/c gave higher efflorescence. The reason explained is that amount of salt transported depends on two factors; capillary suction and permeability. Lower w/c will provide greater capillary suction but lower volume of solution is transported due to lower permeability. Higher w/c will provide higher amount of volume transport but will reduce the capillary rise. Due to the balance between capillary rise and volume of solution transported at moderate w/c, optimum amount of sulfate solution got transpored at 0.45 w/c; thus, more efflorescence formed on the specimens of0.45 w/c.

Role of Slag and Fly Ash on Sulfate Attack
Main

SCMs are blended with Portland cement to provide some resistant to sulfate attack.

benefits of SCMs are due to the dilution effect of C3 A from Portland cement (PC), and pozzolanic effect. Replacement of PC with SMCs reduces the availability of free C3 A to produce ettringite. Through pozzolanic action, SCMs consume the portlandite that would otherwise be

* Efflorescence

Chapter 2: Literature Review used to produce gypsum and ettringite. The secondary C-S-H formed from pozzolanic reaction refines the concrete which becomes less permeable (Ramyar and Inan, 2007; Tikalsky and Corrasquillo, 1992; Wee et al., 2000; Mindess et al., 2003).

With regard to thaumasite formation, ability of SCMs to lower Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H through the consumption of Ca(OH)2 due to pozzolanic and/or latently hydraulic reactions will increase the resistance. C-S-H with Ca/Si of 1.7 has shown to easily convert to thaumasite but when the ratio is reduced to 1.1, C-S-H had more resistance against conversion into thaumasite (Bellmann and Stark, 2007). Addition of slag or fly ash was able to lower the Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H and lead to

silica rich C-S-H which is more resistant to the conversation into thaumasite (Bellmann and Stark, 2007).

2.3.7.1 Role of Slag on Sulfate Attack
Ah0 3 content of slag is emphasized as a predominant factor that influences the performance of slag against sulfate attack (Wee et al., 2002; Gollop and Taylor, 1996a,b; Mangat and Khatib, 1995). Gallop and Taylor ( 1996b) stated that at a certain replacement level of slag, the

resistance increases with decreasing Ab0 3 of slag. It is also found that slag with lower Ab0 3 content increase the resistance even at lower dosages while the slag with higher Ab0 3 contents needs higher replacement to have similar resistance (Gollop and Taylor, 1996b). When the Ab0 3 content of slag is in the range of 8- 10%, a 50% replacement level is sufficient for good resistance whereas Ab0 3 of 13 - 15% requires around 70% replacement level for good resistance (Mangat and Khatib, 1995).

18

Chapter 2: Literature Review Slag with lower Ab0 3 increases the resistance mainly through dilution effect. Slag with higher Ab03 shows resistance at the higher replacement rates because the Ab03 of slag is incorporated into C-S-H, hence not freely available for ettringite formation (Gollop and Taylor, 1996b). Amount of aluminum ions that could be accommodated increases with decreased Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H. At lower slag replacement level, Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H of PC-Slag system is very close to that of 100% PC. At higher slag replacement level, Ca/Si of C-S-H of PC-slag system is lower than that of 100% PC. Lower Ca/Si ratio may lead C-S-H to incorporate much of the released Ae+ ions into C-S-H (Gollop and Taylor, 1996b).

Gollop and Taylor (1996b) tested three different slags each with 11.2, 13.4, and 16.0% Ab0 3 content, respectively. All the blends were composed of 69% slag and 31% PC. After the

exposure to 0.25 mol/L sodium sulfate solution for 6 months, the performance of these blends was accessed by various means such as visual examinations and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. Evaluations showed that the mixes with slag of 13.4% and 16.0% Ab0 3

contents performed .worse than the one without any slag replacement. The slag of 11.2% Ab0 3 performed superior to all the mixes including 100% PC. Further, Gollop and Tayer (1996b) increased the proportion of the 13.4% Ah0 3 content slag to 92% replacement to evaluate the improvement at relatively higher replacement level. The mix at 92% replacement performed superior not only to one with same slag at 69% replacement but to all of the above mixes. This confirmed few important points about slag in sulfate environment. First, increasing Ah0 3 of slag decreases the resistance. Second, lower replacement levels of higher Ab0 3 slag may worsen the case. Third, when replaced at higher level, higher Ab03 slag performs well.

19

Chapter 2: Literature Review Wee et al. (2000) published results of performance of concrete mixtures incorporating slag at 0, 65, 75, 85% replacement levels under 5% Na2S04 solution. The slag used in their study had an A1z0 3 content of 14%. The visual inspection of the specimens after an year under sulfate solution showed that incorporating slag enhanced the resistance in the order of 0% replacement (mostly damaged)>65 % >75%>85% replacement levels. Wee et al. (2000) concluded that higher slag replacement of portland cement resulted in enhanced resistance to sulfate attack in concrete. Although slag contains higher portion of Ab0 3 which would promote ettringite formation, increasing the slag content increased the resistivity because some of Ab0 3 locked as Mullite (3Ab0 3 ·2Si02) and not freely available for the reaction (Wee et al., 2000).

2.3.7.2 Role of Fly Ash on Sulfate Attack
Class F fly ashes have shown enhanced sulfate resistance (Shashiprakash and Thomas, 2001; Tikalsky et al. 1990). However Class CH fly ash was found to be not effective when exposed to sulfate solution and no consistency has been observed with Class CH fly ash level of replacement and degree of resistivity. For example Figure 2.4 shows the' expansion of mortar bars made with high C3A Type I PC, and 20% and 40% Class CH fly ash mixes. Use of Class CH fly ash slowed down the expansion for 12 months but did not control the expansion. 20% fly ash mix expanded more than the control while 40% fly ash showed less expansion than the control. However, another publication of the Thomas et al. (1999) showed 40% Class CH fly ash expanded more than 20% Class CH fly ash; and 20% Class CH fly ash mix expanded more than the control mix. Freeman and Carrasquillo (1995) also reported results showing 35% Class CH fly ash mortar bar expanded lot more than 25% Class CH fly ash.

20

Chapter 2: Literature Review Yet, research involves high calcium fly ash against sulfate attack so far presented conflicting information (Mehta, 1986). High calcium fly ash is characterized with significant amount of C-A-S glass and crystalline compound of calcium (Mehta, 1986). In PC-fly ash systems,

compositions of crystalline and amorphous phases play a major role in resistance to sulfate attack (Tikalsky and Carrasquillo, 1992; Mehta, 1986).

Figure 2.4: Resistance of high C fly ash under sulfate exposure (Shashiprakash and Thomas, 2001)

General belief is that Class F fly ash is associated with increased resistance while Class CH is found to be not effective. Despite this general belief, Mehta's study (1986) showed that not all Class F ashes performed well and not all the Class CH ashes performed poorly. According to Mehta ( 1986), the mineralogical composition of the alumina-bearing hydration products formed before coming into contact with sulfate ions is the deciding factor. When ettringite presented as

21

Chapter 2: Literature Review the alumina bearing hydration products before the exposure to the sulfate ions, the PC-fly ash system performed satisfactorily or excellently. Oppositely, presence of monosulfate hydrate

and/or C-A-H before the sulfate exposure resulted in poor performance, as ettringite is a stable phase while monosulfate is not stable in sulfate solution. Wheatear ettringite or monofulate/CA-H will be formed depends on alumina-sulfate ratio. At higher alumina-sulfate ratio, formation of monosulfate/C-A-H will be favoured on the subsequent submersion into the sulfate solution where at lower ratio the ettringite will be favoured (Thomas et al., 1999).

Tikalsky and Carrasquillo (1992) stated calcium oxide content and calcium aluminate composition of the amorphous phase of fly ash determine whether a given fly ash increases or decreases the resistance. Increase in CaO content results in shorter cracking time for fly ash concrete. Fly ashes with increased portion of crystalline phases such as anhydrite, lime,

periclase, sodalites, and tricalcium aluminates and fewer portions of inert minerals such as mullite, quartz, ferrite, spirel are more prone to sulfate deterioration. Calcium aluminate-rich glasses are more susceptible to long term sulfate expansion (Tikalsky and Carrasquillo, 1992). Tikalsky et al. (1990) stated that high calcium and low silica fly ashes are less resistance to sulfate attack. Figure 2.5 shows the relationship between calcium/silica content of fly ash and the deterioration that Tikalsky et al. (1990) obtained. As Figure 2.5 shows, fly ashes with higher calcium and less silica content took less time to crack whereas fly ashes with less Ca/Si ratios sustained longer period without cracking.

proportion of Fe2 0 3 may promote the formation of iron rich ettringite which is less expansive than the iom-poor ettringite (Tikalsky and Carrasquillo, 1992). Dunstan ( 1980) related CaO and Fe20 3 determine the performance of any fly ash. A factor called R-value where R= (CaO%5)/Fe2 0 3 is derived based on experimental results. In R-value formula a 5% datum is applied to the CaO% based on the assumption that CaO contributed by mullite is less than 5% and is not a cause of sulfate deterioration (Mehta, 1986; Tikalsky & Carrasquillo, 1993). Over the time Rvalue formula's validity has been questioned as there are reported instances where the R-value failed to predict the performance of fly ash (Mehta, 1986; Thomas et al., 1999). In addition, a

23

Chapter 2: Literature Review ajor shortfall ofR-value is that it fails to incorporate the alumina content which would, if high,

produce C4ASH12 and C-A-H (Mehta, 1986).

unsoundness and internal sulfate attack (Freeman and Carrasquillo, 1995). Shehata et al. (2008) reported that addition of optimum gypsum content have reduced the 6-month expansion of 20% Class CH fly ash mortar bars by 70% compared to the expansion of the same 20% fly ash mix without any gypsum added. Freeman and Carrasquillo (1995) reported that, at the optimum

gypsum addition, out of two fly ashes tested one fly ash at 35% replacement with Type II cement resulted in 21% reduction while another fly ash at the same replacement level resulted in 93% reduction in expansion compared to the control mix made up of 100% Type II cement.

2.3.7.3 Effect of Combination of Slag and Fly Ash on Sulfate Attack
Effects of ternary blends of fly ash and slag on sulfate resistance are rarely available in the literature. Research ofNehdi et al. (2004) includes ternary self-consolidating concrete blends of slag and Class F fly ash. Figure 2.6 shows the results from Nehdi et al. (2004) 9-month The test specimens were The PC-fly

The reason for this behaviour of fly ash-slag mix was not investigated but Nehdi et al. (2004) speculated lower permeability due to faster hydration of slag could be a reason for the beneficial action of slag-fly ash ternary blend.

Testing and Evaluation for Sulfate Attack (ASTM C1012)

c

1012 involves monitoring the length change of a mortar bar submerged in sulfate

solution for 6 months. W/C is kept at 0.485 for mixes contain 100% PC while w/c for the mixes with SCM is choose to give the similar flow of 100% PC mortar at 0.485 w/c. From the

prepared mortar, 25x25x285 mm bars and 50x50 mm cubes are made and cured at 100% RH and 35°C for the 24 hours followed by 23 °C in limewater until the cube strength reaches 20 MPa. Once the mortar cube reaches 20 MPa, initial length measurement is taken for each mortar bar . and submerged in 5% Na2S04 solution at room temperature. Length measurements were taken after 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 13, and 15 weeks. After every measurement the bars are transferred into the newly prepared sulfate solution.

One of the main shortfalls of ASTM C1012 is that the sulfate concentration and its pH are not kept constant due continuous submersion of the bars and alkali leaching from the mortar bars, respectively. Further, the test procedure does not represent the field situations as the field

concrete is often subjected to wetting and drying cycles and different temperatures around the year. Hence, laboratory results tend to over predict the ability of the mix compared to the field performance. Further, the temperature the test conducted does not take the formation of As discussed previously, the temperatures between 0 - 5°C

Alkali-silica Reaction

Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a deleterious reaction that takes place in concrete in the presence of sufficient quantities of reactive silica, alkali concentration, and moisture. As a result of ASR, a viscous gel product known as silica-gel forms which, in tum, absorbs water and swells (Saouma and Perotti, 2006).

In the alkali environment (pH ?: 7), reactive silica grains are negatively charged by ionization of Si-OH group and by the disruption of Si-0-Si bonds as indicated by Equation 6. Si-0-Si + OH~

SiOH + SiO- [Equation 6]

Once reactive silica grains are negatively charged, the positive ions are attracted towards the reactive grains and float around it, forming a layer known as diffusing double layer (Chatterji and Thaulow 2000; Prezzi et al., 1997). The negatively charged reactive grains induce silica ions to diffuse out as a result of which positive ions enter into the reactive grain. Hence, an expansion occurs as Na+, Ca2 +, OH- and water permeates to the reactive grains. The expansive pressure is the net pressure due to the entering OH-, Na+, Ca2 +, and water and the diffusing silica ions (Chatterji and Thaulow, 2000). The diffusion of silica is significantly influenced by presence of Ca2+ in . the neighbourhood of the reactive grain (higher the Ca2+ lower the silica diffusion) (Chatterji and Thaulow, 2000). Further it is reported that presence of more bivalent ions

compared to the monovalent ions and lower N a2 0e in the gel system reduce the concrete expansion (Prezzi et al., 1997).

Chapter 2: Literature Review

2.4.1
The

Influence of Aggregate Type on ASR
rocks that contain reactive silica are cryptocrystalline quartz, and poorly

crystalline/metastable silica. Examples include opal, quartz glass, colcanic glass, cryptocrystalline quartz, strained quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite (Fournier and Berube, 2000). There is no generalized correlation between particle size of the reactive aggregates and the level of expansion. Researchers have produced conflicting results regarding the effect of particle size on expansion. According to Diamond and Thaulaw (1974) and Fournier and Berube .(2000), ·decrease in particle size increases the expansion; where Multon et al. (2008) showed an increased expansion with the increased particle size.

2.4.2

Influence of Alkali Content on ASR

Potential alkali sources are Portland cement, high alkali fly ash, aggregates incorporating alkalibearing minerals such as zeolites, chemical admixtures, and mixing water. Increase in alkalinity in concrete increases the degree of reaction (Carrasquillo and Snow, 1987; Swamy and Al-Asali, 1988). Swamy and Al-Asali (1988) tested concrete prisms made up of cement alkalinities 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 5.2 kg/m 3 · As shown in Figure 2.7, expansion increased with increase in cement alkalinity. Further noting, increase from 4 to 5.2 kg/m 3 alkalinity resulted in significant increase compared to the increase from 3 to 4 kg/m 3 alkalinity cement. Similarly, decrease from 3 to 2.5 kg/m 3 resulted in significant reduction in expansion than that of 3.5 and 3.0 kg/m 3 alkalinity. It seemed, at least in this particular case, that the alkalinity levels 3 to 4 kg/m 3 is critical beyond which a significant change in expansion behaviour occurs (Swamy and Al-Asali, 1988).

2.4.3

Supplementary Cementing Materials on ASR

In most cases, SCMs such as slag or fly ash help controlling ASR. Past research proved the beneficial action of slag, Class F fly ash, and silica fume against ASR (Thomas et al., 1999; Shehata and Thomas, 2000; Monteiro et al., 1997). Beneficial effect comes due to dilution of alkalis (when SCMs contain less reactive materials, ex. less alkali content, than Portland cement), pore size refinement (since SCMs lower permeability), pH reduction (through consumption of Ca(OH)2 ), and alkalis binding abilities of SCMs (Monterio et al., 1997).

29

I)Uchesne and Berube (1994a,b) tested various SCMs to evaluate the role of pore solution alkali reduction and portlandite depletion in controlling ASR. They found that there is no "global" relationship exists between the degree of reaction and the depletion of portlandite and pore solution alkali reduction (Figure 2.8). However, specimens with less than 0.65 N (NaOH+KOH) pore solution alkali concentration expanded less than the CSA limit 0.04%. Hence, Duchesne and Berube (1994a,b) concluded that unless portlandite is almost completely depleted, pore solution alkali depletion is the dominant beneficial effect that SCMs bring, rather than portlandite depletion.

Ability of an SCM to reduce Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H influences ASR. Surface charge of C-S-H depends on Ca/Si ratio where higher the ratio leads to positive charge and lower ratio leads to negative charge. When surface charge of C-S-H is positive, cations are not incorporated into C-S-H but when the charge is negative, cations are incorporated into C-S-H. Thus, SCMs cause the alkali cations (eg. Na+) to bind into C-S-H, making them unavailable for ASR (Monteiro et al., 1997).

2.4.3.1 Role of Fly Ash on ASR
Effectiveness of fly ash in mitigating ASR depends on three factors; fineness, mineralogy, and chemistry of fly ash (Shehata and Thomas, 2000, 2002; Malvar and Lenke, 2006). Often fly ash efficacy is· related to its chemical constitutions mainly calcium, alkali and silica. This section reviews the literature on efficacy of fly ash based on the chemical constituents.

Chapter 2: Literature Review

Research shows that fly ash containing more than 10% CaO is not suitable for controlling ASR.

25 % replacement of Class F fly ash provided good mitigation while Class CH fly ash required
higher replacement level to obtain similar level of expansion reduction (Malvar et al., 2002; Shehata and Thomas, 2000).

CaO, Si02 and alkali content are the primary constituents influence the efficacy of a fly ash (Shehata and Thomas, 2000; Malvar and Lenke, 2006). Shehata and Thomas (2006) showed good correlation between the parameter Na20e x CaO/Si02 of cementing blend and the amount of available alkali for ASR (Figure 2.9). The parameter Na20e x Ca0/Si0 2 was obtained from the chemical analysis of the cementitious materials and calculated based on the proportion of each cementitous material in a mix. The contributed alkalis were determined from the amount of alkalis leached from the hydrates of the paste into the surrounding alkali solution (Shehata and Thomas, 2006).

Figure 2.10 shows expansion of mortar bars as a function of Si02 and CaO of the fly ash, respectively. The analysis was done by Malvar and Lenke (2006) using several published data. As Figure 2.10 show, expansion is inversely proportional to Si0 2 content and linearly proportional to CaO content of the fly ash.

Contarary to Shehata and Thomas (2006) and Malvar and Lenke (2006) who found a relationship between quantity of CaO in fly ash and the degree of reaction, Carrasquillo and Snow (1987) did not find a clear relationship between CaO content of fly ash and expansion as shown in Figures 2.11a and b where Figure 2.lla shows replacement of high alkali Portland cement (HAPC) and Figure 2.11 b shows replacement of low alkali Portland cement (LAPC) with 28% fly ash. Duchesne and Berube (1994a) also reported that among the two fly ashes tested, the prism with the higher calcium (12.0% CaO; 75% Si02+Ah0 3) content expended less than the one with the lower calcium fly ash (1.9% CaO; 64% Si02 + Ah03). Duchesne and Berube (1994a) expressed the opinion that Si02 + Ah03 contents of the fly ash plays the leading role rather than calcium content; and pointed out that in most cases low calcium fly ashes have more Si02+ Ah0 3 than high calcium fly ashes, and the low calcium fly ash used in their study had less Si02 + Ab0 3 than that of high calcium fly ash of their study.

Class F fly ashes have been very effective reducing the pore solution alkalinity compared to Class CH fly ashes. It was found that if a particular fly ash at certain replacement level was able to lower the pore solution alkalinity to 0.6 mol/L or less, then the expansion of concrete prism will be within the provided CSA/ASTM limit (0.04% expansion in two years) (Shehata and Thomas, 2000).

2.4.3.1.2

Alkali Content of Fly Ash

Carrasquillo and Snow ( 1987) showed that degree of ASR increases with the alkali content of fly ash. Carrasquillo and Snow (1987) used four different fly ashes along with HAPC in mortar bars. 35

Mortar bars were made with different aggregates (Highly reactive and control aggregates), and different fly ash replacement levels (17% and 34%). The expansion at 6 months is plotted against the alkali content of the fly ashes. Results, as in Figure 2.12, showed that increase in alkali content of fly ash increased the expansion. This could be due to availability of alkalis from fly ash for the contribution of pore solution alkalinity (Carrasquillo and Snow, 1987). Carrasquillo and Snow
(~987)

further showed that for fly ashes with less than 1.5% of alkali

content the expansion of mortar bars decreases as the replacement level increases. However, for the fly ashes with greater than 1.5% alkali content, the expansion is higher than the control mixes if the mortar bars is not replaced with sufficient fly ash .

Chapter 2: Literature Review Shehata and Thomas (2006) investigated the level of alkali leaching from pastes of various supplementary cementing materials into the surrounding alkali solution. They took two fly ashes of the similar calcium content (17.51% and 18.37%) but different alkali content (1.68% and 5.35%). Apparently, as in Figure 2.13, the fly ash with higher alkali content had leached more

alkalis, indicating that the fly ash has more alkalis than its hydrates can bind (Shehata and Thomas, 2006). This high alkali contributed by fly ash was also associated with higher

expansion of the corresponding concrete prisms (Shehata and Thomas, 2006) .

2.4.3.1.3

Microstructural Studies on Fly Ash Concrete

Bleszynski and Thomas (1998) published the microstructual analysis performed on control and 40% Class F fly ash concrete using the back-scattered electron (BSE) technique. The analysis conducted on control concrete showed distinct calcium, sodium, and potassium bands at the reaction sites. The Ca/Si ratio is found to vary from the interface to the centre of the reactive

37

particle where the ratio is higher at the interface and lowered towards the centre. In the case of 40

% fly ash concrete, no distinct high calcium band was observed (Bleszynski and Thomas,

1998). Bleszynski and Thomas (1998) stated that in Portland cement concrete presence of high calcium band of gel acted as a membrane which supplied alkalis to the reactive aggregate grains but prevented the gel to diffuse out, creating expansive pressure. Absence of high calcium band around the reactive grain in 40% fly ash concrete indicated that consumption of Ca(OH) 2 by fly ash is a reason for less expansion of fly ash concrete (Bleszynski and Thomas, 1998).

2.4.3.2

Role of Slag on ASR

Slag is beneficial at relatively higher replacement level (Figure 2.14); for instance, around 40% GGBFS replacement is needed to achieve the comparable benefit of 25% Class F fly ash (Malvar et al., 2002). The mechanism by which slag reduces the ASR expansion at higher replacements

is not well understood yet (Thomas and Innis, 1998). However, researchers have found out that the concretes with slag have reduced and maintained the pore solution alkalinity lower than the control concrete (Duchesne and Berube, 1994b). Further, the analysis on ASR gel composition gives few indications the role of slag on controlling ASR.

Studies on Gel Composition of Slag Concrete

Analysis performed by Arano and Kawamura (2000) showed that the gel of 20% slag mixture had less alkali content than the control mix; and the OH- ions in the pore solution was reduced but only to a little extend compared to the control.

Monteiro et al. ( 1997) compared the effect of supplementary cementing materials on ASR expansion and obtained the gel composition for the corresponding mixes. They found 45% slag replacement did not have significant reduction but 55% slag replacement significantly reduce the expansion. This gap between 45 and 55% replacement level cannot only be explained based on the alkalinity of the SCM (i.e. slag) alone (Monteiro et al 1997). Gel composition showed that 55% slag had higher CaO content, less Na20e than 45% slag mix; the ratios of Ca0/Na20e for 55% slag mix is higher than that of 45% slag. These findings supported the double layer theory

39

Chapter 2: Literature Review that presence of more monovalent ions than divalent ions promotes the expansion (Monteiro et al., 1997; Chatterji, 2000).

2.4.3.2.2

Pore Solution Alkalinity of Slag Concrete

Rasheeduzzafar and Hussain (1991) reported that besides being as alkali dilutant, at higher replacement levels, slag is very active in removing alkalis from pore solution. Rasheeduzzafar and Hussain (1991) found that this beneficial effect is clear especially with lower alkali cement and as the alkalinity of the cement increases alkali removal ability of slag decreases. Duchesne and Berube ( 1994b) also produced results showing that alkalinity of the pore solution of slag concrete is less than that of control as in Figure 2.15.

Effect of Combination of Slag and Class CH Fly Ash on ASR

If slag and Class CH fly ash are used individually, then their approximate individual replacements of slag and Class CH fly ash requires above 40% (Rogers et al., 2000; Shehata and Thomas, 2000). Shon et al. (2000) showed that when slag and Class CH fly ash are combined

with Portland cement, as ternary blends, synergistic effect takes place resulting in enhanced resistance to ASR. Figure 2.16 shows that expansion of mortar bars soaked in 1M NaOH

solution at 80°C (AMBT). Figure 2.16 indicates that ternary blend mortar bars expanded less than the binary blends of slag and fly ash at all replacement levels. Further it is evident that in order to fall below the potentially reactive criteria (0.1% at 14 day as indicated in Figure 2.16), around 30% Class CH fly ash and 40% slag is needed in binary blends. However, it is noticeable in Figure 2.16 that 15% fly ash+ 25% slag ternary blend met the 0.1 o/o limit easily.

2.4.4 ·2.4.4.1

Laboratory Evaluation for ASR Accelerated Mortar Bar Test

Accelerated mortar bar test (AMBT) is adopted as a standard test by ASTM C 1260, AASHTO T 303 and CSA A23.2-25A. In CSA A23.2-25A, mortar bars are casted using the specified

aggregate gradation, cementing materials and a w/c 0.5 (w/c varies between aggregate types). Produced specimens are cured at in the standard curing room for 24 hours. After demolding, the mortar bars are submerged in water and heated at 80°C for another 24 hours after which the initial reading is taken. After the initial reading, the bars are submerged in IN NaOH solution at 80°C. The test has been criticised as being conservative in the sense that in reality the concrete may not be exposed to high concentration external alkali source and the reaction may not last longer (Malvar et at., 2002). And, it is also likely that alkali content of the cement will have little, if any, influence on the expansion since the plenty of alkalis are provided from the solution (Malvar et al., 2002). However, this test is a quick screening tool to detect potential reactive aggregates and to detect slowly reacting aggregates (Malvar et al., 2002). In conc.rete, the SCMs control the ASR by alkali binding where as in AMBT SCMs limit the expansion by reducing the penneability. Further, AMBT supplies external alkalis which makes difficult to evaluate the ability of alkali binding capacity of pozzolans.

2.4.4.2

Concrete Prism Test

Concrete mixtures are casted using the reactive aggregates, cementitious materials and w/c ranging from 0.42 to 0.45 into the moulds of 25 x 25 x 285 mm. The alkali content is brought to 1.25% Na2 0eq of the Portland cement mass. After 24 hours of initial curing in the standard

42

Chapter 2: Literature Review curing room, the specimens are demoulded, initial reading taken and placed in 100% RH and 38°C environment. Length change is monitored periodically at least for 1 year if no SCMs are

used and 2 years if SCMs are used. Unlike AMBT, in the prism test, no alkalis are fed externally; hence, any alkali contribution has to come from the concrete itself. Though prism test better represent the real situation, it is less conservative and may fail to detect slowly reacting aggregates; and the test conditions permit the alkalis to leach out of the concrete (Malvar et al., 2002; Thomas et al., 2007).

2.4.4.3

Alkali Leaching Test

Shehata and Thomas (2006) described a method to evaluate the ability of a paste to bind alkalis. The experiment stats with preparation of paste sample(s) w/c of0.5 and curing over water (23°C) for 28 days. After the curing period, the paste is to be broken into pieces and screened between 1.25 and 0.18 mm sieves. Then the broken fragments get transferred into bottles with various concentrations of pre-determined alkali solution (Omol/L, O.lM, 0.25M and 0.4M). For each alkali concentration, one control bottle kept without any paste fragments. The bottles are tightened and left for a period of 3 months to achieve chemical equilibrium. Then, the change in concentration of the surrounding alkali solution is measured using flame photometer with respect to the control bottle. Increase in concentration is attributable to leaching of alkali from the paste. More alkali leaching would indicate the availability of more alkalis for ASR (Shehata and Thomas, 2006).

43

Salt Scaling
Salt scaling is a deterioration mechanism arises due to the use of deicer salt on concrete surfaces. The damage is in the form of removal of cement paste chips and, sometimes, aggregates. Unlike freeze-thaw, salt scaling does not have an impact of mechanical properties of concrete such as strength or stiffness (Valenza and Scherer, 2007a). However, scaled concrete may create a path for water and/or other chemical to enter to further reduce the durability. Researchers found that regardless of type of salt used a pessimum salt concentration exists around 3% (<;opuroglu and Schlangen, 2008; Valenza and Scherer, 2007c). However, most of the mechanisms used to explain the salt scaling is from freeze-thaw deterioration that fail to explain the existence of pessimum salt concentration (Valenza and Scherer, 2007c).

One speculation is that different thermal strain forms as the ice melts. Presence of salt reduces the melting point of ice. Once the melting point of ice is reduced, it would obtain the heat necessary to melt from the concrete surface. Heat will be lost from the surface but the core remains at the same temperature, resulting in differential temperature throughout the concrete body. Differential temperature causes stresses to develop at the surface (Valenza and Scherer, 2007b).

Second thought is that once the concrete surface is pooled with salt solution, pore solution will start to equilibrate with the salt solution. The increase of salt concentration in the pore solution will increase the degree of saturation at the surface. Increased level of saturation will results in frost action at the surface. Depth of concrete that equilibrate with the pool of solution on the surface increases with time (Valenza and Scherer, 2007b).

44

Chapter 2: Literature Review A third thought is that when the ice form from the salt solution, ice does not incorporate any salt ions; hence, the concentration of the remaining solution increases when the salt solution frozen. A pressure, called osmotic pressure, is created as a result of movement of liquid from low concentration region to higher concentration region. In the case of salt scaling osmotic pressure is created as water moves from the regions where ice formed to the regions of remaining brine solution (Valenza and Scherer, 2007b ).

Air entrainment reduces the scaling in two ways; by reducing bleeding and by helping to relive the hydraulic pressure (Valenza and Scherer, 2007a,b; Pigeon et al., 1996). When bleeding is reduced the resulting surface will be stronger which would provide more resistance. Surfaces finished with accumulated bleeding water tend to be weaker, porous, and may contain pockets that would transport salt solution below the surface (Mindess et al., 2003). Figure 2.17 shows that there is a huge improvement when the concrete is air entrained.

Effect of Salt Concentration
one of the above given explanation for the occurrence of salt scaling account for the pessimum alllount. Valenza and Scherer (2007 c) proposed a mechanism saying that since ice layer

contracts faster than the concrete, contraction of ice layer creates tensile stresses. Based on the viscoelastic analysis of the stresses on ice, Valenza and Scherer (2007 c) stated that pure ice does not crack in the freezing temperature range of salt scaling tests. When the concentration is pessimum, the ice contains brine pockets and flaws that would promote the cracking of ice. Once the ice is broken, tensile stress develop in concrete along the perimeter of the broken ice pieces. When the concentration of the solution is high, the ice layer is not strong enough to exert stress as it contains too much brine pockets (Valenza and Scherer, 2007 c).

2.5.3

Effect of Water-Cement Ratio and Strength

Scaling resistance increases as the w/c ratio decreases. Lower w/c will result in less bleeding and higher strength. Less bleeding will produce stronger surface to resist salt scaling. It is also worth to note that lower w/c will result in lower ,permeability and lower permeability may be susceptible for larger hydraulic pressure (Panesar and Chidiac, 2007; Valenza and Scherer, 2007a).

2.5.4

Effect of Curing Conditions

Afrani and Rogers (1994) performed salt scaling test under various curing conditions; moist room at 23°C, covered with wet burlap and polyethylene in ambient outdoor conditions, curing compound in ambient laboratory air, and curing compound in ambient outdoor air. The tested concrete includes Control HAPC, Control LAPC, 50%slag, 25% Slag, and 51 %fly ash+25%slag. Afrani and Rogers (1994) did not remove the curing compound prior to the test. The wet burlap in outdoor conditions performed better than laboratory moist room curing or laboratory curing compound curing with an exception of one case; 50%GGBFS + 50% HAPC. Curing compound has performed better than moist room curing in mixes of 100% LAPC, but worsened the mix 50%GGBFS +50%HAPC. Curing compound did not show any significant difference compared to moist room cunng tn the cases of 75%HAPC + 25%GGBFS and

24%HAPC+51 %PSFC+25%GGBFS mixes (Afrani and Rogers, 1994).

Bilodeau et al. (1991) tested control (100%PC) , 20% Class F fly ash and 30% Class F fly ash concretes with different curing periods; 3, 7 and 14 days using curing membrane. After the curing periods of 3, 7 and 14 days, the specimens were brushed to remove the membrane from

47

Chapter 2: Literature Review the surface. The specimens were dried for various periods before starting the cycles. The

specimens cured with membrane showed significant improvement in scaling resistance. Further, extended moist room curing did not have any significant improvement in scaling resistance. In fact, few mixes have shown adverse effects due to longer curing in the moist room. For example, 20% fly ash mix cured in the moist room for 3 days and dried 4 weeks scaled less than the same mix cured in the moist room for 7 days and dried for 4 weeks. Similar observation was made on 30% fly ash mix for 3 days curing and 14 days curing (Bilodeau et al., 1991 ).

2.5.5

Effect of Cementing Materials on Salt Scaling Resistance

Contradictory results exist regarding the supplementary cementitious materials resistance to salt scaling. Some research has shown that incorporating SCMs into the mix worsen the situation where other research has shown that SCM mixes performed well (Bouzoubaa et al., 2008).

In the laboratory produced scaling slabs, porous layer on the concrete containing SCMs is thicker
than concrete without SCMs. Such a noticeable porous layer is not observed in the field.

Presence of a thicker porous layer in lab slabs with SCMs may give an indication that SCMs perform poorly with respect to salt scaling (Bouzoubaa et al., 2008).

2.5.5.1

Role of Fly Ash on Salt Scaling

Concrete incorporating fly ashes have shown more scaling than the control spectmens (Bouzoubaa et al., 2008). Common reasons attributed to the poor performance of fly ash are that

fly ash acts as inert materials at the early stage, reducing the hydration rate and increasing the

48

Chapter 2: Literature Review effective w/c. Also, fly ash increases the more porous interfacial transition zones at the early stages that will promote the scaling (Marchand et al., 1997; Thomas, 1997).

Figure 2.19 presents the results from Bouzoubaa et al. (2008) showing fly ash concrete scaled a lot more than the control concrete. In addition, Figure 2.19 shows the discrepancy between the testing procedure, namely ASTM and Bureau de normalization ·de Quebec (BNQ). The

discrepancy between the two test standards indicates that specimen preparation and finishing techniques influence the results to a greater extend. Such a discrepancy is attributed to the differences in testing procedure between two standards. Unlike ASTM, BNQ does not require to brush the bleed water. Determining the end of bleeding is subjective and if brushing is done too early or too late, the air void system at the surface may be destroyed. Finishing the concrete right after screeding is considered as a better option rather than waiting for bleeding to stop when no significant bleeding is expected. Also, BNQ standard requires the slabs to be submerged in the salt solution for 7days prior to the beginning of the cycles. This step will make the pore solution in equilibrium with the solution on the top of the slabs, thus reducing the osmotic pressure. Reduction in osmotic pressure could also be a reason for improved performance in BNQ test standard (Bouzoubaa et al., 1998).

Figure 2.19: Effect of laboratory test procedure in salt scaling residue (Bouzoubaa et al., 2008)

Bilodeau et al., 1994 investigated the susceptibility of air-entrained concrete incorporating fly ashes from 8 different sources according to ASTM standard. All the concrete with fly ash performed poorly with the ASTM scaling rating of 5 after 50 cycles. The poor performance was partly attributed to the finishing practices and to the lower compressive strength at the beginning ofthe cycles (Bilodeau et al., 1994).

Talbot et al. (2000) conducted ASTM C 672 on concretes with Class F fly ash and Class CH fly ash at replacements of 40% and 20%. Concrete with 20% and 40% Class F resulted in 2.01 and 2.90 kg/m2 , respectively. Concrete with 20% Class CH fly ash resulted in 2.77 kg/m2 . The control 100% PC concrete ended up with 1.09 kg/m2 . This indicates that the concrete with fly ash (both low calcium and high calcium fly ashes) perform poorly. However, Class CH fly ash have

50

Chapter 2: Literature Review shown to perform slightly better than Class F fly ash, as generally Class CH fly ash is able to retain more air due to its lower organic content (Thomas, 1997).

2.5.5.2

Role of Slag on Salt Scaling
For example,

Lack of consistency exists on the performance of slag against salt scaling.

Bouzoubaa et al. (2008) showed incorporating 25% slag in laboratory produced slabs (as per ASTM) to perform better than the control whereas 35% slag scaled more.than the control. When the test was performed on the 25% slag and 35% slag cores, both 25% and 35% slag performed better than the control. Further, Bouzoubaa et al. (2008) tested the 35% slag mix according to

BNQ standards. When tested using BNQ standards, the 35% slag mix performed better than the control. The possible reasons for such a deviated behaviour between the two test standards are discussed in 2.5.5.1.

Panesar and Chidiac (2007) performed statistical studies using the published experimental results. The study correlated the slag content with the scaling residue. The general trend reported is that increasing the slag content increases the scaling. The scaling of formed surface is less than that of on finished side due to bleeding and destruction of the air void system.

There are a few possible reasons postulated in the literature for the poor performance of slag concrete. They are, 1. Excessive bleeding. Delayed setting time of slag will result in longer bleeding period. Unless steps are taken to carefully monitor and to judge the end of bleeding period, the concrete may be finished prematurely before bleeding stopped. Finishing before bleeding stops will leave a weaker layer at the surface (Afrani and Rogers, 1994).

51

Chapter 2: Literature Review 2. Inadequate length of curing. The heat of hydration for slag concrete is normally less than that of a plain PC concrete. Relatively low internal curing temperature may result in coarser and less matured microstructure for slag concrete. Extended curing period for slag concrete may allow denser hydration products to form that may in tum enhance the scaling resistance (Afrani and Rogers, 1994).
3. Carbonation. Ca(OH)2 + C02 ~ CaC03 + H20. Firstly, carbonation in slag concrete

forms products called aragonite and vaterite that are more soluble than calcite. Secondly, carbonation in slag concrete may decalcify C-S-H as availability of Ca(OH) 2 will be reduced through the pozzolanic reaction of slag. Both of these

actions will result in coarser micro structure in slag concrete making it more vulnerable for salt scaling (Valenza and Scherer, 2007a,b; Stark and Ludwig, 1997). Figure 2.20 a) shows that as the carbonation on slag concrete increases, the scaling deepens. Figure 2.20 b) shows that capillary porosity increases for carbonated slag concrete compared to the non-carbonated slag concrete; and, insignificant difference in capillary porosity of carbonated and non-carbonated plain concrete mix (Stark and Ludwig, 1997).

Laboratory Evaluation for Salt Scaling

In ASTM C 672: Standard test method for scaling resistance of concrete surfaces exposed to deicing chemicals, concrete specimens of 300x300x75 mm are made by consolidating 70 times with the steel rod followed by strike off of the excessive concrete with a wood trowel. Final finishing is not carried out until the bleeding stops. Once the bleeding stooped, the wood trowel is used to finish the surface with maximum of three strokes. The concrete slabs are then moist

54

Chapter 2: Literature Review cured at 23°C and 100% RH for 14 days followed by another 14 days of drying period at 23°C and 50% RH. After the drying period 4% CaCb solution is pooled on top of the concrete slab to a depth of 6 mm and exposed to the freezing and thawing cycles. Each freeze/thaw cycle is 24 hours long whose freezing portion consists of 16 - 18 hours at -17 .8±2.8°C and thawing portion consists of 6- 8 hours at 23±3°C. When the depth decreases due to evaporation, water has to be added to bring the depth 6mm. The scaled masses are collected every 5 cycles for 50 cycles by washing the slab with water, and the collected masses are dried to a constant mass at 105°C before weighed. In addition to the collection of scaled concrete, visual rating is done based on a scale 0 to 5 where 0 is given for no scaling, 1 is given to slight scaling, and 5 is given to severe scaling.

MTO LS-412 is similar to ASTM C672 with few differences. MTO standard requires using NaCl instead of CaCh. The standard does not specify to wait for bleeding to stop before

finishing. However, places emphasise on finishing by requiring to use wood trowel with the maximum of 2 stokes; back and forth once. The solution depth has to be maintained at 6 mm and if the depth decreases the N aCl solution has to be added to bring the depth to 6 mm where in ASTM standard water is added to maintain the depth at 6mm.

MTO LS-412 specifies to use 3% NaCl solution to wash the scaled off particles during the collection process every 5 cycles where in ASTM C672, water is used to wash off the particles. LS-412 specifies the limit of 0.8 kg/m2 after 50 cycles as the satisfactory performance for a concrete.

Freeze-thaw Damage

Non-air entrained concrete is not immune to freeze-thaw cycles (Mindess et al., 2003). Different theories have been cited to explain the mechanism(s) of freeze-thaw damage. Among them, hydraulic pressure theory and osmotic theory are popular. The former is attributed to the

pressure due to the volume change when the ice forms. The later is attributed to the pressure created by the movement of water from lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration. As the ice forms, there is a 9% increase in volume. This increase in volume compresses the unfrozen water in the pores. Unless, there is enough room to accommodate the unfrozen water that is being compressed, hydraulic pressure will be created (Mindess et al., 2003). Osmotic theory states that when the ice in pores freezes, the solute concentration of remaining unfrozen water increases near the freezing sites. Due to osmosis between the unfrozen water around the freezing sites and the water in the unfrozen sites, water will move causing osmotic pressure (Mindess et al., 2003).

Entraining air bubbles within the concrete increases the immune to freeze-thaw damage. Entrained air bubbles function as pressure chambers where squeezed water will enter and form ice. Once ice is formed inside the air bubble, more water will be drawn towards the bubbles due to osmotic pressure. In tum, the amount of water available in cement paste is reduced. Hence, air entrained concrete is more resistance to freeze and thaw damage (Mindess et al., 2003).

Chapter 2: Literature Review

2.6.1

Role of Fly Ash on Freeze-thaw damage

Bilodeau et al. (1994) tested eight different Type F fly ashes under freeze and thaw cycles us!ng ASTM C 666. After, 300 cycles all the mixes performed well where the lowest durability factor was 96. The researchers extended the test period to 1000 cycles after the excellent performance of the specimens at 300 cycles. Even after 1000 cycles, none of the tested specimens performed unacceptably. However, after 1000 cycles, all the tested specimens showed significant surface scaling of2.24 to 10.93%. In terms of length change, the specimens expanded a little after 300

cycles with the maximum value reported 0.02%. Bilodeau et al. (1994) indicated that even after 1000 freeze-thaw cycles, the core of fly ash concrete remained in very good condition but surface scaling was observed. Malhotra ( 1990) have also reported results showing that air

entrained concrete incorporating around 55% Class F fly ash performed well with durability factor of 99 after 300 cycles.

2.6.2

Role of Slag on Freeze-thaw Damage

Slag does not possess any detrimental effect from freezing and thawing cycles when aggregates are non-frost susceptible, air entrainment is adequate, and adequate strength gain is achieved prior to exposing to freeze and thaJ cycles (Hooton, 2000).

2.6.3

Laboratory Evaluation for Freeze-thaw Damage

ASTM C 666 is widely used in North America to evaluate freeze-thaw resistance of concrete . specimens. In this method, concrete specimens are subjected to 300 freeze and thaw cycles. Each cycle consist of lowering temperature from 4.4°C to- 17.8°C and raising it back from-

Experimental Program

Several experiments were conducted on various concrete, mortar and cement-paste blends to evaluate the performance of ternary, binary, and control blends. Experimental work was

designed to study four widely encountered durability issues; sulfate attack, alkali-silica reaction, salt scaling, and freeze-thaw damage.
In addition to these four durability issues, the basic

properties of concrete were evaluated to see whether the ternary blends meet the fundamentals of concrete - fresh and hardened properties. Purpose of evaluating the fresh and hardened

62

Chapter 3: Materials and Experimental Program properties is to ensure that the evaluated concretes, in addition to satisfying the durability criteria, satisfy the fundamentals.

3.2.1

Sulfate Attack

Evaluation for sulfate attack was carried out using ASTM C 1012. ASTM C 1012 involves monitoring the expansion. of mortar bars soaked in sulfate solution. Mortars bars and standard

mortar cubes (50x50 mm) were prepared. The specimens were cured at.35°C and 100% RH for 24 hours after which they were demolded. Then, the specimens were stored in saturated

limewater until the mortar cubes reach 20 MPa. When the mortar cube strength reach 20 MPa,) the initial length readings of the mortar bars were taken and submerged in 5% Na2S04 solution.

In addition, the same blends were tested for ion migration using RCPT at the age when the cube

strength reach 20 MPa and at 56th day.

The RCPT test results were used to study the role of

permeability in reducing sulfate attack in the investigated blends. Table 3.3 presents the details

Chapter 3: Materials and Experimental Program To further study the role of calcium hydroxide consumption, the paste blends were prepared at the cementitious materials combinations shown in Table 3.3. The calcium hydroxide content of the paste samples were determined by the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) after 28-days of curing.

3.2.2

Alkali-silica Reaction

To evaluate the alkali-silica reaction, concrete prisms were made with reactive aggregates (Spratt) and Sunderland sand. Stainless steel studs were attached at both ends of the prism to facilitate the length change measurements. The length change of the prisms was monitored for 2 years.
In addition, accelerated mortar test was carried out on the same blends used to make prisms.

Mortars bars were prepared using the crushed Spratt aggregates and monitored for length change under the exposure of IN NaOH solution at 80°C. The length readings were taken periodically for 28 days.

Further, to evaluate the alkali binding capacity of the ternary blends, cement paste blends were prepared. Table 3.5 summarizes the blends combinations. Paste fragments were stored in

solutions of 0 mol/L and 0.25 mol/L alkali concentrations for a period of 1 month after which the change in the concentration in the surrounding solution was measured using flame photometry. Increase in concentration in surrounding solutions is attributable to alkali contributed by paste hydrate and decrease in concentration is attributable to incorporating alkalis from surrounding solution into the hydrates of the paste fragments. Higher increase in concentration of the

Salt Scaling

Salt scaling resistance was evaluated by exposing concrete slabs (300x300x75 mm) with salt solution pooled on the surface to freezing and thawing cycles. Concrete mixtures were made at w/c of 0.45, constant cementing material factor of 350 kg/m 3 . Air entraining admixtures and water reducers were adjusted to obtain around 5% air content and 100 mm slump, respectively. The damage is evaluated by collecting the scaled off mass from the surface of the concrete. Ternary blends, binary blends and control mixtures were tested. The test standard (MTO LS-

65

Chapter 3: Materials and Experimental Program 412) states the slabs to be cured 14 days in moist room and 14 days at 23°C and 45- 55%. relative humidity. In this study, all the slabs were cured as specified in MTO LS-412 and in addition, slabs from two concrete mixtures were tightly wrapped with polyethylene and cured outside of curing room. The details of the two curing regimes conducted in this study are given in Table 3.6. Table 3.7 contains the cementing materials proportions used to make the concrete mixtures for scaling slabs. Table 3.7 also contains how each mix is cured before being exposed to the salt solution.

The intention of curing outside the curing room is to prevent the moisture dripping on the slabs. Moisture dripping will leach the alkalis and calcium hydroxide which would otherwise be used for pozzolanic and latently hydraulic reactions of SCMs. The slabs were tightly wrapped as to prevent the moisture loss so that the slabs will be cured with the internal moisture. The aim is to sacrifice the moist room curing in order to prevent the leaching of alkalis from the surface. If internal curing is adequate and alkalis are prevented from. leaching, then it is expected that the resistance of the slabs when exposed salt will be enhanced. On the other hand, if the internal curing is not adequate, then the surface microstructure will be coarser.

Initially, it was decided to use a curing compound instead of wrapping with polyethylene. However, existing literature shows the controversy that impro~ement due to curing compound arises because of the removal of the thin layers from the surface as the curing compound is brushed off before exposing to the salt (Valenza and Scherer, 2007a). Exposing the slabs with the curing compound membrane did not seem to be an option as the scaled off mass would include the curing compound membrane along with concrete/paste chips. Hence, it was decided

66

Chapter 3: Materials and Experimental Program to use thick polyethylene sheets and duct tape to tightly wrap the slabs. It should be emphasized here that the slabs were tightly wrapped in order to minimize the condensation which would lead to alkali leaching.

Effect of curing regimes on alkali retention ability method is evaluated by measunng the concentration of (Ka+ + N a+) ions released by concrete chips into the surrounding distilled water over the period of one month. Two concrete cylinders were made from the same concrete mix (40% Slag) but one specimen was curing as per Curing Regime A and the other one cured as per Curing Regime B. After the curing and drying period, chips were removed by brushing the top surface and screened to finer particles. Particles then soaked into distilled water and allowed to leach alkalis for one month. After one month, the host solution concentration was measured and reported in ppm.

Freezing and Thawing

Freezing and thawing damage is accessed by exposing prisms of various ternary, binary and control blends to freezing and thawing cycles. The test standard followed is ASTM 666,

Procedure A. Same concrete from the salt scaling slabs was used to make the prism specimens. At the end of every 35 cycles, the damage is accessed by measuring the change in dynamic modulus of elasticity and the weight loss of the prisms. The test continued until 300 FIT cycles.

3.2.5

Compressive Strength and RCPT

Concrete cylinders (height 200 mm; diameter 100 mm) were made for compressive and RCPT from the same concrete used for salt scaling and freeze-thaw tests. Compressive strength was tested at 1, 7, 28, 56 days by crushing 3 cylinders. RCPT was carried out at 7, 28, 56, and 91 days using at least 3 specimens (obtained from the same cylinder) for each age.

Thermal Gravimetric Analysis

Paste samples were prepared at the same cementitious materials combinations shown in Table 3.3 using a high-speed, high-shear food blender. The w/c was kept 0.5 for all the samples. The prepared paste blends were poured into plastic moulds of 2 in. (50 mm) diameter and 4 in. (100 mm) height and cured at 100% relative humidity and 95°F (35 °C) for the first 24 hours. Then, the samples were de-moulded and soaked into limewater at 73.4 °F (23°C) for another 27 days. After that, the samples were taken out of limewater and broken into pieces and soaked into alcohol for 1 week. Then, the samples were stored in the oven at 80°C until the day of analysis. On the day of running TGA, the fragments were taken out of the oven and screened through the 1.18 mm sieve. Analysis was carried using the instrument AutoTGA 2950HR V6.1A on the paste power passed through 1.18 mm sieves.

Prepared mortar bars were cured in the moist curing room for 24 hours after which they demoded and heated to 80°C in water. The specimens were kept at 80°C in water in order to offset the thermal expansion from the expansion due to ASR itself. Hence, initial readings were taken after the samples were subject to 80°C in water. After, the initial readings, the bars were transferred into the pre-heated 1 N NaOH solution.

The quantities used to make 0.25 M solution are given in Table 3.8. A reference bottle full of alkali solution with no paste fragments was also prepared. The bottles were tightened to prevent the evaporation and left in the laboratory for 1 month. After 1 month, Na+ and K+ ions were counted (in ppm) from each bottles using the Advanced Technical Services GmbH 200S model flame photometer. bottles.

Salt Scaling Resistance

MTO LS-412 test standard for salt scaling was used run the test. Slabs were cast into 300x300x75 mm wooden moulds. The concrete mix proportions are given in Table 3.9. After consolidating the excess concrete was screened off. Finishing was not done right after screeding but done after bleeding ceased with 2 strokes by wood trowel. Then, the gentle brushing was applied on the surface to remove any laitance and to leave a slightly textured surface. MTO LS412 states the slabs to be cured 14 days in moist room and 14 days at 23°C and 45- 55% relative humidity. In this study, all the slabs were cured as specified in MTO LS-412 and in addition, slabs from 2 concrete mixtures (20/20 and 40 slag) were cured using different method. This curing method the slabs were cured in the moist room for about 20 hours for the slab to develop enough strength to be demolded. After demolding, the slabs were wrapped with thick

polyethylene for another 13 days. Then, the wrap was removed and the specimens were let to

Effect of Salt Scaling Curing Regimes on Alkali Retention Ability

In order to evaluate the effect of Curing Regime A and B on alkali retention ability on concrete

surface, concrete two specimens from the same mix were made and each was cured according to Curing Regimes A and B, respectively. It was made sure that the specimen stored in the moist room stood up with the finish surface facing the water dripping throughout the 14-day curing period. After 14 days curing and another 14 days of drying period, powdered fragments were removed from the finished surfaces with the aid of a steel wire brush. The removed powder was then introduced into the bottles with distilled water with the solid to liquid ratio of 1 to 10. After 73

Chapter 3: Materials and Experimental Program one month, the Na+ and K+ concentration of the host solution was measured for the two samples using the ATS 200S flame photometer.

3.3.9

Freeze and thaw

Freeze and thaw test was done (as per ASTM C666) on the same mixtures as in salt scaling test. Concrete prisms of 75x75x285 mm were made as the experimental specimens. After 14 days of limewater curing, the initial measurements were taken at 0°C. The da~age was accessed using weight loss and pulse velocity (ASTM C 597). Pulse velocity was used to predict the dynamic modulus of elasticity from which the durability factor was calculated after 300 cycles. The relationship between dynamic modulus of elasticity and pulse velocity provided in ASTM C 597 is used obtain the dynamic modulus of elasticity (Equation 10). However, it should be noted that ASTM 666 does not mention about deriving dynamic modulus of elasticity using a relationship with pulse velocity; rather, ASTM C666 states to use the fundamental resonant frequencies (ASTM C215) to obtain the dynamic modulus of elasticity. Due to the unavailability of the equipment complies with ASTM C215, it was decided to use ASTM C 597 to obtain the dynamic modulus of elasticity.

3.3.10 Compressive Strength and RCPT of Concrete Samples
Cylinders were made from concrete of propert:ies of proportions shown in Table 3.9. Cylinders were cured in the moist room until the day of testing. RCPT specimens were obtained by cutting 50 em (2 in) specimens using a wet saw. Compressive strength and RCPT were carried out as per ASTM C 39 and ASTM C 1202, respectively.

3.3.11 Fresh Properties
Concrete mixtures were designed (Table 3.9) to study the fresh properties of ternary, binary and control mixtures. These concrete mixtures differs from that used in salt scaling specimens as air admixture and water reducer dosages were kept constant in the mixes. Air content and slump were tested immediately after the mixing process ·was over. Air content was determined using CSA A23 .2-4C, pressure method and slump was tested using CSA A23 .2-5C. Bleeding of the concrete specimens was determined according to Method A of ASTM C232. The remaining concrete was sieved through 4.75 mm sieve to obtain the mortar for the setting time as per ASTM C 403.

Performance of Binary Blends against Sulfate Attack

Binary blends tested include blends with Class CH fly ash and blends with slag. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 present the expansion of fly ash and slag blends, respectively. The 40% fly ash mix broke before 4 months while 20% fly ash specimens lasted slightly longer than 4 months. Replacing PC with Class CH fly ash did not improve the sulfate resistance; instead it has worsened the case. This behaviour is reported elsewhere and commonly attributed to high calcium content, high alkali content, lower silica content, and tendency to form monosulfate prior to exposing to the sulfate solution (Shashiprakash and Thomas, 2001; Freeman and Carrasquillo, 1995).

replacements further reduced the expansion below ASTM 6-month and 1-year limits, 0.05% and 0.1 %. The superior performance of slag blends is attributable to the lower

Ah0 3 (7.4%) content of slag and dilution of C3A in the cementing materials. In addition, increasing slag content also increases the ability to incorporate Ae+ ions into C-S-H (Gollop and Taylor, 1996b).

illustrates that increasing the fly ash content in ternary blends decreased the expansion dramatically. For example, 20% FA1 mix expanded more than the control and broke at 15 weeks where 20/20 mix expanded slightly lower than the control, lasted longer than

Figure 4.5: Effect of slag content on expansion of ternary blends

Contribution by slag to the performance of ternary blends could be due to several beneficial actions of slag. As a result of pozzolanic reaction, consumption of Ca(OH)2 might have made Ca2+ unavailable for ettringite formation. Secondary gel produced due to slag's pozzolanic reaction might have reduced the permeability of the mortar bars. This is evident from the 56th day RCPT values of the mortar mixes. Increasing slag content resulted in less coulombs passing through the specimens. 20%FA+40%Slag is less permeable (2722 Coulombs) than 20%FA+30%Slag (3258 C) and 20%FA+30%Slag is more permeable than 20/20 (4017 C). Accordingly, 20%FA+40%Slag is more

resistant than 20%FA+30%Slag and 20%FA+30%Slag is more resistant than 20/20. In

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis addition, slag results in lower Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H which could make more Ae+ to be incorporated into C-S-H, thus making Ae+ not available for delayed ettringite formation (Gollop and Taylor, 1996b).

Ion Migration- RCPT on Mortar Specimens

RCTP values of mortar specimens at 56 days are given in Table 4.2. The values on Table 4.2 are average of at least two specimens. The RCPT value of each specimen is presented in Appendix D. The measured RCPT values could be used as a measure of two factors: ion migration and degree of hydration. Lower permeability will limit the sulfate ions migration into the concrete/mortar hence improve the resistance while increased hydration product might incorporate more reactive alumina into C-S-H (Shehata et al., 2008). The blends with slag reduce permeability and this could be explained based on increased level of hydration due to slag. Incorporating fly ash resulted in increased

permeability due to slower reaction rate of fly ash. Similar observation could be made with the ternary blends. Ternary blends with higher fly ash portion have shown increased permeability while the ones with higher slag decreased permeability. For example,

20%FA+30%slag is less permeable than 20+20 because the both have same Hy ash content but former has more slag. The ternary blend 20%F A+40%Slag is less permeable . than 40%FA+20%slag because former has more slag and latter has more fly ash.

The RCPT values at 56 days are plotted against the mortar bar expansion at 9 months and shown in Figure 4.6. Two different trends were observed between mortar bar expansion and 56-day RCPT. One trend resulted in very good correlation (Correlation-!, R2
=

0.9621) while another trend resulted in poor correlation (Correlation-2, R2 = 0.1907). The blends composes Correlation-! are control, 15/15, 20/20, 20%FA+30Slag, 20%F A+40%Slag, and 40% Slag. The blends on the Correlation-2 are 20%FA+40%Slag, 40% Slag, 30% Slag, 30/30, 20% Slag, and 40%FA+20%Slag. The 20%FA+40%Slag, and 40% slag blends are included in both correlations since they are located in the path of the two correlations.

Figure 4.6: Correlation between mortar bar expansion and RCPT at 56th day

The expansion of blends located in Correlation-! is influenced by permeability to a considerable degree.
In this sense, the reduction of 15/15 and 20/20, and

20%F A+30%Slag is partly attributable to their permeability. The blends of Correlation-2 cannot be explained based on permeability criteria. For instance, 20%FA+40%Slag and 40%F A+20%Slag have a huge difference in their permeability but the expansion values are very close to each other.

This pattern reveals that the blends in Correlation-2 are mainly affected by alumina binding and Ca(OHh consumption. Ability of slag to lower Ca/Si of C-S-H, hence to incorporate Al 3+ into C-S-H is a prominent beneficial action ofslag and is discussed elsewhere (Gollop and Taylor, 1996b; Wee et al., 2000). Thus, expansion of the binary slag blends in Correlation-2 could be due to their effectiveness in binding Ae+. 85

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis The ternary blends on Correlation-2 draw special attention. Addition of slag in ternary blends might have helped to incorporate the reactive alumina from Class CH fly ash. If that is the case, 30/30 and 20%F A+ 30%Slag have the same slag content but the former has more fly ash content, thus, it is expectable that the former would not perform well compared to the later. However, the expansion results show that 30/30 ended up with lower 9-month
exp~nsion.

Same comparison could be made with 20/20 and

40%F A+20%Slag. Hence, it is evident that in ternary blends not only slag but also the Class CH fly ash has a positive role in enhancing the resistance. The permeability trend in Figure 4.6 does not provide a ground to explain the lower 9-month expansion of 30/30 and 40%FA+20%Slag. Beside the permeability (i.e. migration of S04-2), Ca(OH)2

content plays significant role in controlling the sulfate resistance. Next section deals with the Ca(OH)2 content and the expansion of mortar bars.

4.1.6

Calcium Hydroxide Contents

Table 4.3 lists the Ca(OH)2 contents of the paste samples obtained from thermal gravimetric analysis conducted after 28 days of curing. The 28 days curing consisted of first 24 hours at 35°C and 100% RH and the remaining 27 days at 23°C under limewater. The details of the experimental results can be found in Appendix G. The data of ternary blends and slag from Table 4.3 are plotted in Figure 4. 7 to show the relationship between the mortar bar expansion and the Ca(OH)2 content of paste samples. The fly ash points are not included as the fly ash binary blends disintegrated before 6 months.

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis The calcium hydroxide contents of the blends with SCM is lower than the the control. Control blend contained 19.2% Ca(OH)2 where adding 20% FA have reduced the Ca(OH)2 to 11.5%. In addition, Figure 4. 7 shows the linearity between the Ca(OH)2 and the mortar bar expansion of ternary blends with R2 of 0.904. The obtained correlation confirms that Ca(OH) 2 consumption is a contributing factor for the performance of ternary blends. Out of all the ternary blends tested, 40%F A+20% Slag blend resulted in lowest Ca(OH)2 content. This confirms that increased Ca(OH)2 consumption of

40%F A+20Slag is at least partially responsible for the excellent performance of this blend. Further, the blends 30+30, and 20%FA+40%Slag also obtained lower Ca(OH)2 contents, confirming that increased Ca(OH)2 consumption is a contributing factor for the reduced expansion of the mortar bars of these blends.

4.2

Alkali-silica Reaction

Appendix A contains the expansion values of concrete prisms up to 2 years age. Some of the concrete prisms were made during summer 2008 and hence they are only 1-year old by the time this document is being prepared. CSA and ASTM standards require 2 year expansion of concrete prism to determine satisfactory performance of the blend(s). However, for the purpose of evaluating the relative performance between mixes, expansion up to 1 year is considered to be sufficient.

4.2.1

Concrete Prism Expansion for Binary Blends

Figure 4.8 shows the expansion of 20%, 30% and 50% fly ash concrete prisms. It is evident from Figure 4.8, increasing the fly ash content has reduced the expansion. The

88

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis 50% fly ash blend reduced the expansion significantly where 20% and 30% Class CH fly ash blends had slightly lower reduction effect than 50%FA. Note that 20% fly ash and 30% fly ash exceeded the 2-year limit of 0.04% before 26 and 39 weeks, respectively. This suggests that in order to suppress ASR expansion Class CH fly ash replacement as high as 50% is required. In the case of Class F fly ash, 25% replacement is sufficient to suppress the expansio!l (Thomas et al., 1999; Rogers et al., 2000). Lower efficiency of Class CH fly ashes is well known and is attributable to the higher calcium and alkali contents and lower ability to bind alkalis into hydrates (Thomas et al., 1999).

In the case of slag, the literature reports higher slag content (above 40%) is required to

suppress ASR expansion below the limit.

Figure 4.9 contains the concrete prism

expansion of 40% and 50% slag mortar bars. Incorporating slag has significantly reduced the expansion but it is now too early to predict whether 40% slag replacement is sufficient to suppress the expansion below 0.04% at 2-years. Exact mechanism for the

action of slag on ASR is not yet understood (Thomas and Innis, 1998). Yet, slag's beneficial actions are attributable to its ability to dilute the alkali content of cementing materials and reduce the pore solution alkalinity (Duchesne and Berube, 1994b).

Concrete Prism Expansion of Ternary Blends: Effect of Fly Ash Content on Ternary Blends

Figure 4.10 contains the concrete prism expansion of 20% FA, 20/20 and 40% FA/20%Slag. According to Figure 4.10, at 12-months the 20% fly ash binary blends ended up with expansion of 0.109%. At 12-months, the ternary blend 20/20 has reduced the expansion to 0.02%, almost 82% reduction with respect to 20% fly ash binary blend. Further increasing the slag/fly ash content to 40F A/20Slag resulted in more reductions in expansion. It is also notable that 20/20 falls right at the CSA 2-year limit with the expansion of 0.041% at 2-year.

Figure 4.11 contains the expansio·n of 20/20, 20%F A/30% Slag, and 20%F A/40%Slag. As in Figure 4.11, increasing slag content in ternary blends reduces the expansion. With respect to 20/20, 20%F A/30%Slag has reduced the expansion by 39o/o at 2-year. In terms of CSA acceptable criteria, 20%F A/30% Slag blend well meets the limit of 0.04 at 2-year. In addition, the 20%F A/40% Slag- blend is only at the age of 1 year but from the current trend it is expectable that 20/40 will expand less than 20/30.

Synergy of Ternary Blends against ASR

Figure 4.12 shows that expansion of 20%FA/40%Slag is less than the individual expansion of 20%F A and 40%Slag. Synergy could be illustrated by showing that

92

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis reduction in expansion of 20%F A/40% Slag blend is less than the ·summation of individual reduction in expansion of 20% FA and 40% Slag binary blends where the reduction in expansion is determined with respect to the control ( 100% PC) blend. Using the 1-year expansion data the synergy calculation performed is shown below (Table 4.4).

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis Figure 4.13 gives the expansion at 2 year for the prisms reached that age. Only two mixes (20%F A/30%Slag, and 20%F A/40%Slag) well meet the CSA 0.04% limit after two years while 20/20 falls right at the limit with 0.041% expansion. It appears that the required level of replacement of Class CH fly ash and slag in ternary blends is above 40% in order to suppress the expansion. It is worth noting that 15/15 have reduced the 2-year expansion by 63% from the control mix where 20/20, 20%F A/30% Slag, and 40%F A/20%Slag have reduced (with respect to control) by 84, 90, and 98.8%, respectively. The effect of increase in ternary fly ash/slag content from 20/20 to

20%F A/30%Slag is less pronounced on the expansion compared to that of from 15/15 to 20/20. This suggests that the rate of reduction in expansion after certain amount of ternary replacement is small. It is also evident that in order suppress the expansion to the CSA limit, the ternary replacement greater than 20/20 is required.

Accelerated Mortar Bar Test Results

Appendix A contains the expansion values of the accelerated mortar bar (AMBT) specimens and their average for each mix tested. Figure 4.14 contains the summary of all the blends tested using AMBT. AMBT is a quick test that could be used to screen the potential reactive aggregates. CSA adopted 0.10% expansion at 14-day as the acceptable benchmark for limestone aggregates and 0.15% for other aggregate types (Fournier and Berube, 2000). Out of the blends tested only the following blends; 50o/o FA, 20%F A/30%Slag, 20%F A/40%Slag and 40%F A/20%Slag meet the CSA 14-day limit of 0.1 0%. 50o/o slag binary mix fails the CSA acceptable criteria with 0.16% expansion. One could argue that in the case of binary blends, you need as high as 50% replacement level with Class CH fly ash or slag. Better performance could be achieved with 20% Class CH fly ash and 40% slag in ternary blends to meet the 0.10% limit. These ternary . blends incorporate less amount of fly ash and slag than that is required if they were to be used individually in binary blends. With reference to Figure 4.14, it appears that the required replacement of Class CH fly ash and slag in ternary blends is greater than 50% as 20%FA+30%Slag mix marginally fails the CSA 14 day limit. The next level

investigated is 20%F A +40% Slag and 40% Slag and 20% FA. These two mixes ended up with similar expansion values both at 14 and 28 days. The fact that 20%F A +40%Slag and 40%Slag +20%FA ended up with the similar expansion indicates that at higher replacement level, the relative proportion of slag and fly ash in ternary blends has negligible effect.

Correlation between Accelerated Mortar Bar and Concrete Prism Tests

The advantage of AMBT is that it is a quick test that could be used to predict the poor performance of a blend. Yet, criticism has been made on AMBT due to it less reliability compared to the concrete prism test. Hence it is essential to draw the relationship

between 14-day AMBT values and 2-year concrete prism expansion. Table 4.5 presents the expansion values of AMBT and concrete prism at 14-days and 1- year respectively. As few concrete prisms have not reached 2-year age, the correlation is made with 1-year prism expansion and 14-day AMBT expansion and is shown in Figure 4.15. Based on Figure 4.15, a correlation with R2 of 0.8802 was obtained between the 14-day AMBT and 1-year concrete prism expansions.

Alkali Binding Ability of Fly ash and/or Slag Blends

The raw data and calculations of leaching test are provided in Appendix F. Table 4.6 contains the results from the leaching test on control, binary and ternary blends. Six blends were tested include control, 15115, 20/20, 30/30, 20% FA and 40% Slag. The change in alkali concentration on the host solution is considered to be a result of alkali release from the stored paste fragments. Increase in alkali concentration of host solution is taken as the indication of available alkalis for ASR. As in Table 4.6, control and 20% fly ash are the one released most of the alkalis in both host solutions. The ternary blends were effective in controlling the alkali release.
In ternary blends, the effectiveness

increases as the replacement level increases. The 40% Slag performed well in terms of reducing the alkali release however, in both solutions, 40% slag released slightly higher than 30/30.

Figure 4.16: Relationship between concrete prism expansion and alkali release

The relationship shown in Figure 4.16 could be used to explain the better performance of ternary blends. Particularly, 20/20 have bound the alkalis to the similar level as of 40% Slag. This reveals that ternary blends increase the efficacy of binding alkalis despite the presence of Class CH fly ash. Shehata and Thomas (2006) stated that the efficacy of But the ternary

binding alkalies decreases with increasing calcium content of fly ashes.

99

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis blends show that the 20% Class CH fly ash could be incorporated with another 20% slag to result in highly efficient alkali binding capacity. A 20% binary slag blend is not

included in this study, however, from the published literature, it is evident that neither 20% slag nor 20% Class CH fly ash binary blend would expand to meet the 0.04% 2-year limit (Rogers et al., 2000). However, the two year expansion of 20/20 is 0.041 %; such a reduction might have occurred mainly due to its alkali binding capacity.

In order to see the trend of correlation between released alkali and the concrete prism expansion, a few more points (Table 4.7) corresponding to the concrete prisms contained 5.25 kg/m 3 Na20eq were taken from Shehata (2001) and added to Figure 4.16, and is shown in Figure 4.17. Figure 4.17 reveals that the current study and the points from Shehata (2001) follow similar trend; however, the points are slightly scattered in Figure 4.17, so a correlation similar to the one obtained in Figure 4.16 is not possible.

Salt Scaling

Figure 4.18 summarizes the scaling results of the mixes tested. All the slabs were cured as in MTO LS412; that is 14 days in moist room followed by another 14 drying period. Collected scaling residue is reported as mass per area of the slab exposed to the salt solution. The points on Figure 4.18 are the average of three slabs except for the control where only two slabs were tested. The scaling residue of each specimen, average of at least two specimens and their standard deviations can be found in Appendix B. The mixes with slag have experienced severe scaling damage than the control where control has no significant scaling. Ternary blends have performed better than the slag concrete

101

Figure 4.19: Effect of curing on scaling resistance

It is well clear that curing B have significantly improved the scaling resistance. Curing B

has reduced approximately 60% and 55% scaling loss for 40% Slag and 20/20 mixes, respectively. In addition, 20/20-Curing B meets the the MTO limit of 0.8 kg/m2 and 40% Slag mix lies at the limit with 0.82 kg/m2 scaling residue. Pictures taken after 50 cycles are included in Figure 4.20.

4.3.1

Effect of Slag on Salt Scaling

Increased scaling of concrete containing 30% and 40% slag is in agreement with the well reported results (Valenza and Scherer, 2007; Bouzoubaa et al., 2008; Stark and Ludwig, 1997). The 40 % and 30% slag mixes produced the highest compressive strength at 28 day compared to other mixes evaluated. Poor performance of slag binary mixes gives the indication that strength is not a governing factor for scaling resistance of these two mixes.

Care was taken to eliminate the bleeding water before finishing with wood trowel. After the two strokes of finish, a 75 mm brush was used to eliminate the sheen of water from the surface. Hence, it could be expected that accumulation ofbleed water might not have played a significant role in accelerated scaling. Another factor believed to influence the scaling of slag concrete is carbonation (Stark and Ludwig, 1997). As shown by Stark and Ludwig ( 1997), carbonation might be a dominant factor responsible for the severe scaling of slag concretes. Rate of scaling in slag concrete is very high for the first 10 cycles, marked by a steep slope in Figure 4.18. After 10 cycles, the rate of scaling stated to reduce. This pattern is most probably due to the fact that after 10 cycles the scaling depth reached non-carbonated surface.

Increasing slag content from 30% to 40% has resulted in almost same amount of scaling after 50 cycles. Both 30% and 40% followed the same trend; first 10 cycles severe scaling occurred thereafter the rate of scaling is reduced. These may be due to the fact

that carbonated layer in both concrete existed approximately for the same depth; perhaps, the depth of carbonated layer for 40% slag concrete is little higher than that of 30% slag.

106

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis However, when both concrete reached the non-carbonated layer both has scaled virtually at the same rate.

4.3.2

Effect of Ternary Blend on Salt Scaling

If total SCM content is considered, ternary blends have performed relatively well. That is if 15/15 is to be evaluated against 30% slag (both have the same SCM content), then 15/15 have performed well than 30% slag. Similarly, 20/20 performed better than 40% slag. The available literature gives contradictory results regarding the performance of slag and fly ash in binary and ternary blends. For example, Bouzoubaa et al. (2008)

published results showing that 35% Type F fly ash concrete scaled 2.82 kg/m 2 where 35% slag scaled 0.95 kg/m 2 after 50 freeze and thaw cycles when tested according to ASTM C672. Afrani and Rogers (1994) also showed concrete with 18% Type F fly ash scaled 1.31 kg/m2 and concrete with 25% slag scaled 0.42 kg/m2 after 50 freeze and thaw cycles when tested according to MTO LS412. Hooton and Boyd (1997) showed 35%

slag concrete scaled 0.50 kg/m2 after 50 cycles when tested according to MTO LS412. Bouzoubaa et al (2008), Afrani and Rogers (1994), and Hooton and Boyd (1997) give the impression that fly ash is worse than slag, and slag scaled either within the MTO limit of 0.8 kg/m2 or marginally exceeding that limit. However, it has been shown well that slag worsen the scaling resistance mainly due to carbonation, excessive bleeding, and finishing practices (Valenza and Scherer, 2007; Stark and Ludwig, 1997). In addition, the current study has also exhibited increased scaling of 30% slag and 40% slag concretes as discussed earlier (Figure 4.18).

107

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis Scaling resistance of high calcium fly ash is not widely available as of low calcium fly ash. However, available literature suggests that ASTM Class C/CSA Class CH fly ash does not reduce the salt scaling resistance compared to Class F fly ash. Naik et al. (1998) have showed that concrete with 35% ASTM Class CH fly ash performed even better than the plain concrete. At the end of 50 cycles, Naik et al. (1998) have given ASTM Rating 0 to 35% Class CH concrete and ASTM Rating 1 to the control concrete. This indicates that Class CH fly ash enhances the resistance. On the other hand, Hooton and Boyd (1997) showed that 15% Class CH fly ash scaled 0.36% kg/m2 where the control concrete scaled 0.14 kg/m 2 .

According to the current study, 15/15 (cumulative scaling of 0.99 kg/m2 ) performed better than 30% slag (1.97 kg/m2 ) and 20/20 (1.65 kg/m 2 ) performed better than 40% slag (2.03 kg/m2 ). Enhanced performance of ternary blends might be due to the enhanced performance of Class CH fly ash itself. N aik et al. ( 1998) results shows that Class CH fly ash performed well against salt scaling. In addition, incorporation of Class CH fly ash in ternary blends ·might have improved the resistance due to reduced bleeding and, thus, ended up with less porous surface layer than binary slag concrete. The bleeding results (Table 4.12) indicate that both 15/15 and 20/20 have ended up with reduced bleeding than the control. The bleeding for 15/15, 20/20, Control, 30% slag and 40% slag mixes are 0.16, 0.30, 1.34, 2.56, 2.93%, respectively (see Section 4.6).

4.3.3

Effect of Curing on Salt Scaling Resistance

Figure 4.19 shows the scaling results of the two mixes (i.e. 20/20 and 40% Slag) that went through the modified curing method (Curing B). The intention of curing outside the

108

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis curing room is to prevent the moisture dripping on the slabs. Moisture dripping will leach alkalis and calcium hydroxide which would otherwise be used for pozzolanic reaction of SCMs. The slabs were tightly wrapped as to prevent the moisture loss so that the slabs will be cured with the internal moisture. The aim is to sacrifice the moist room curing in order to prevent the leaching of alkalis from the surface. If internal curing is adequate and alkalis are prevented from leaching, then it is expected that the resistance of the slabs when exposed salt will be enhanced. On the other hand, if the internal curing is not adequate, then the surface microstructure will be coarser.

As stated above about 55-60% reduction in scaling loss occurred as a result of curing by plastic wrapping, which is a significant reduction. The improvement shows that internal

curing was effective and adequate, and alkali leaching could have an impact on reduced scaling resistance of SCM concretes tested in the laboratories. The curing method

prescribed in MTO and ASTM standards could be partially responsible for the discouraging results from accelerated laboratory testing. For example, Hooton and Boyd ( 1997) have observed discrepancy between the performance of lab specimens and the field concrete where the lab specimens showed severe scaling than the cores from the field. Similarly, Thomas (1997) reported several cases where concrete containing fly ash performed well in the field which is not consistent with the poor laboratory performance in the accelerated conditions such as ASTM C 671.

In order to confirm the differences in alkali retention at the concrete surface, the Leaching Test was conducted on chips from the top of concrete specimens from Curing A

109

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis and Curing B. Two cylinders (200 mm height; 100 mm diameter) from 40% slag

concrete mix were made and each cured according to the respective curing regimes. Experimental details of this test are described in Chapter 3. Table 4.8 contains the alkalis released by each sample in one month into distilled water. The results indicate that the sample of Curing B leached approximately 130% of K+ and N a+ with respect to the sample of Curing A. . The difference in alkalis leached indicates that concrete surface cured by wrapping retained more alkalis than the concrete cured in the moist room. This suggests that higher alkalis retained on the surface of 20/20 curing B and 40% curing B is a dominant factor responsible for enhanced performance of these salt scaling slabs.

Dynamic modulus of elasticity is calculated using the correlated relationship between pulse velocity and dynamic modulus of elasticity.

The results showed that no

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis significant amount of internal damage have occurred to the concrete as the Durability Factors are very high. However, surface scaling was observed toward the end of the test period and is evident from the pictures of Figure 4.21. Especially few specimens from 20/20 and 40% slag have scaled more than any other mixes. The scaled surfaces have also made the pulse velocity measurements difficult and variable by the end of the test period (after
~200

cycles).

The surface scaling might have occurred as a result of Still, higher

presence of bleed water and destruction of air void at the surfaces.

Durability Factors indicate that when ternary and binary, and control mixes are adequately air entrained (~4-6% ), the internal damage will be controlled to a greater extend.

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis Initially at day 1, control gained the highest strength than the other mixes that contained SCMs. 15/15 and 30% Slag mixes gained second highest values followed by 20/20 and 40% slag. 15/15 and 30% slag concretes gained almost the same compressive strength,

11.5 and 11.7 MPa respectively. Similarly, 20/20 and 40% slag concretes gained very close to each other, 10.0 and 9.7 MPa respectively. This indicates that at the very early stage replacing the Portland cement with SCM lowers the strength to the same level regardless of ternary or binary mix. The total SCM content in 15/15 and 30% slag mix

being equal, they both ended up with the similar strength at day 1. Same observation could be made with 20/20 and 40% slag.

At later ages, the COJfCrete with slag content reached higher strength of all the mixes tested. Strengths of 40% slag and 30% slag at 28 and 56 days are similar but at .7 day 40% slag concrete achieved slightly lower strength than that of 30% slag. The slightly lower strength of 40% slag compared to 30% slag at 7 days could be attributed to the fact that not all the slag grains are activated before 7 days. Highest strength of slag mixes

resulted due to its latently hydraulic nature (Mindess et al., 2003).

Ternary blends were superior to the control at and after day 7 but obtained lower strength than slag mixes. Having 15115 achieved lower strength compared to 30% slag and 20/20 obtained lower than 40% slag indicates that Class CH fly ash did not enhance the strength development to the level of slag. The higher strength of 20/20 than 15/15 at later ages

might be due to the higher slag content in the former mix. Further, no evidence was observed for synergetic action in ternary blends, rather it seems that slag content is the

Figure 4.23: Total charges passed during the Rapid Chloride Permeability Test

At 7 day of age, the ternary blends are the least effective in terms of permeability. That is, 20/20 and 15/15 have the highest charge passed through when tested at 7 day. The slag concretes have the lowest permeability values. At 7 day, permeability of 15115 and

20/20 are in high range (>4000 coulombs); where control and slag blends are in the moderate range (2000 - 4000 coulombs). From Figure 4.23, the dramatic decrease in permeability of ternary and binary blends from 7 day to 28 day can be observed. Blends 15/15, 20/20, 30% Slag, and 40% Slag have reduced coulombs by 54, 68, 49 and 69%, respectively; but the corresponding reduction for the control concrete is only 12%. However, such a sudden reduction for mixes with SCM is absent at 56 or 91 days. This sudden reduction after 7 day could be attributed to the pore filling effect due to increased level of hydration from SCM mixes. After 3 months, the binary slag blends permeability

4.6.2

Slump

Slump was measured using the slump cone described in ASTM C143. The result shown in Table 4.12 indicates that the all the concretes tested exhibited excellent workability. It should be emphasised here that all the mixes had normal subsidence of concrete without any breaking up when the slump cone was lifted to measure the slump. Further, the all the mixes were highly cohesive and no segregation was occurred.

4.6.3

Bleeding

Concrete with slag increased the bleeding significantly compared to the .control mixture where the ternary blends ended up with reduced rate of bleeding. The increased bleeding in 30% Slag and 40% ·Slag mixes is due to their higher slag replacement level.
It is

stated elsewhere that slag of fineness equal to that of Portland cement tend to increase the bleeding (Kosmatka et al., 2002). The fineness of Portland cement and slag used in this

study was measured by materials passing 45Jlm method. Portland cement retained 4.6% while slag retained 3.9% of the initial mass on 45Jlm sieve. Increased bleeding in slag concrete is, hence attributable to the similar fineness of Portland cement and slag. Kosmatka et al. (2002) contains results showing that concrete containing 25% Class CH fly ash have resulted in around 0.34% bleeding where control mixture resulted in higher bleeding around 1.75%. Further, it has been widely observed that fly ash concrete

reduces the bleeding (Berry and Malhotra, 1980). Most likely the incorporation of Class CH fly ash is responsible for the reduced bleeding in ternary blends. 15 and 20% fly ash in 15/15 and 20/20 have reduced the bleeding significantly.

120

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis

4.6.4

Setting Time

The control concrete is the one with shortest initial set of all the mixes tested. The ones with slag took little longer than the control for initial setting time. Ternary blends are the ones with the most delayed initial setting time, exceeding the control and slag mixes. Similar observation was made for the final setting time; control reached the final setting time first, followed by slag and ternary blends. This clearly reveals that adding slag or fly ash reduces the rate of reaction and hence delays the setting. However, slag binary blends set faster than ternary blends due to the incorporation of fly ash into the ternary blends. Early setting of slag concrete than ternary blends is due to the enhanced

reactivity of slag than the fly ash. Incorporation of fly ash into ternary blends have delayed the initial and final setting times and hence, made the interval between them longer. Comparing the setting times of ternary blends 15115 and 20/20, there is around 1 hour difference between their corresponding setting times. That is 20/20 took 1 hour longer than 15/15 to reach the initial setting time and 1 hour delayed to reach the final setting. However, 30% slag and 40% took approximately same time to reach the initial and final setting.

Chapter 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

5.1

Conclusions

Based on the materials used and experimental works conducted tn this study, the following conclusions were made:

1. The binary blends with Class CH fly ash had low sodium sulfate resistance than the control mix.

2. The binary blends with slag significantly improved the resistance to sodium sulfate attack and resulted in much less expansion even at 20% replacement level. At 30% and 40% slag replacement levels, the expansion met the ASTM limits of 0.05% at 6 month and 0.1% at 1 year. It could be stated that 30 - 40% low alumina slag is sufficient to suppress the expansion to the acceptable level.

3. All the ternary blends reduced the expansion due to sulfate with respect to the control blend where the binary blends with Class CH fly ash resulted in expansion higher than control. The incorporation of slag as little as 20% into the blend

made possible to incorporate Class CH fly ash with increased resistance. The ternary blend with 40% Class CH fly ash + 20% slag resulted in superior performance and this is viewed as a significant finding since 40% Class CH fly ash binary blend dramatically reduced the resistance.

122

Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations

4. Some correlation was obtained between the Ca(OH)2 content in the paste samples of ternary blends at 28 days and the expansion of sulfate attack mortar bar at 9 months. This shows Ca(OH)2 consumption is a contributing factor in resisting sulphate attack. Further, the blend 40%FA+20%Slag resulted in the lowest Ca(OH)2 content of all the samples tested confirms that Ca(OH)2 consumption of this blend is a contributing factor for reduced expansion of its mortar bar under sulfate solution.

5.

Based on accelerated mortar bar (AMBT) and concrete prisms expansion, binary Class CH fly ash blends reduces the expansion due to ASR but not significantly effective. Higher replacement (>50%) levels might work to satisfy the expansion requirements.

,.
6.

'

f '

Incorporation of slag in the levels of 40% and 50% also reduces the ASR expansion. However, both 40% and 50% did not meet the CSA AMBT limit of 0.1 at 14-day.

7. Expansions of ternary concrete prisms of Class CH fly ash and slag are smaller

than the individual expansions of corresponding binary blends.

8. An excellent correlation existed between the alkali binding capacity and the ASR concrete prism expansion; and this suggests that alkali binding ability of the binary and ternary blends is a contributing factor in controlling ASR expansion.

123

Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations

9. A very good correlation was found between 14-day expansion of AMBT and 1year expansion of concrete prisms; this suggest AMBT could be used as a quick screening tool to detect potential ASR aggregates.

10. Salt scaling resistance of concrete containing slag is significantly reduced despite the highest .str~ngth development.

11. The ternary concretes, in companson to concrete of same level of slag replacement, (ie. 15/15 vs 30% slag), have improved the scaling resistance. The exact reasons for this improvement are unknown. But the potential reasons could be partially attributable to the lower bleeding of ternary blends.

12. Storing outside the curing room with the slab tightly wrapped using polyethylene enhanced the salt scaling resistance significantly. The possible reasons for such a beneficial action are attributable to prevention of alkali leaching from the concrete surface. The alkalis are necessary for slag to activate and for the pozzolanic reaction of SCMs.

13. The tested control, slag and ternary blends resulted satisfactory performance against freeze-thaw cycles. The durability factors at the end of 300 cycles are very ·high, indicating that adequate air entrainment provide sufficient protection.

14. Generally, the strength development rate is higher for the concretes with slag replacement. The ternary blends scored the next highest development rate followed by the control concrete.

Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations 15. At later age, the concrete with slag replacement is less permeable followed by the ternary blends. Less permeability of binary and ternary blends is due to the

formation of secondary C-S-H and pore refinement. The control concrete resulted in higher permeability than the ones with SCM replacement.

16. Air content and slump increase with the increased Class· CH fly ash and/or slag content in the mix. The bleeding for the ternary blends are significantly lower than that of the control and slag mixes where slag mixes have excessive bleeding. The reduced bleeding for the ternary blends might be due to the presence of Class CH fly ash in them.

17. Ternary blends resulted in delayed initial and final setting times followed by the slag concretes. The control reached the initial and final setting times faster than other concretes. Delayed setting of ternary concretes might be due to lower

reactivity of fly ash than slag. The binary blends with slag are relatively faster than the ternary blends and this indicates that slag has higher reactivity than Class CH fly ash in fresh concrete.

5.2

Recommendations

Class CH fly ash lacks the consumer confidence in using as supplementary cementing material as a result of reported poor performance against sulfate attack and alkali-silica reaction. Ternary blends tested in the current study are promising as a remedy to incorporate Class CH fly ash in concrete. The results showed that in ternary blends of

125

Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations fly ash and slag, more Class CH fly ash could be incorporated with increased resistance to sulfate attack. Ternary blends performed satisfactorily in the case of ASR as well. Hence, the results of this study provide the basis to draw the attention towards ternary blends of Class CH fly ash and slag as a mean for safe incorporation of Class CH fly ash.
It is recommended to further investigate the mechanism of slag/Class CH fly ash ternary

blends and its applicability in real cases. The ternary blends produced higher salt scaling residue than the MTO limit of 0.80 kg/m2 . In order to overcome such a shortfall, it has been shown to enhance to salt scaling resistance by preventing alkali leaching. This study adopted the polyethylene wrapping as a way to cure using the internal moisture and to prevent any water dripping. If plastic wrapping is not a applicable method to the field practices, it is recommended to consider curing compounds or any other suitable methods rather than applying moist stream or any other ways by which alkalis might be washed away.

Description

Initial mass of the prisms before FIT commenced Volume of the specimen is computed by taking the dimensions 75x75x285 mm Density is computed by dividing mass/volume Poisson ratio is taken as 0.15 Measured time that pulse takes to travel between the transducers at the beginning of the FIT test. Measured time that pulse took to travel between the transducers at the end of the FIT test Initial pulse velocity is calculated by dividing Column 6 by the distance between the two transducers. The distance between the two transducers is 75 mm. Final pulse velocity is calculated by dividing Column 7 by the distance between the two transducers. The distance between the two transducers is 75 mm.

p(l + 1Jd)( 1 - 2v d)

~

The parameters of this equation are stated in Chapter 3 of this thesis

11

The equation in Column 10 is used to calculate the modulus of elasticity at the end of the test (300 cycles). The pulse velocity at 300 cycles is substituted into the equations.

12

Percentage of initial dynamic modulus after 300 FIT cycles is calculated by diving Column 10 by Column 11. Durability Factor After 300 cycles is taken as percentage of initial dynamic modulus. Column 13 is average of durability factor for 3 specimens.

This concentration is after the dilution of the original solution at the dilution ratio of 1 to 100. Final K+ is measured from the each bottle with paste fragments. The solution from the bottles is diluted at the ratio of 1 to 100 and the concentration of the diluted solution was measured for ppm of K+ with the flame photometer Concentration of Na+ ions (ppm) in the blank solution as measured by the flame photometer. This concentration is after the dilution of the original solution at the dilution ratio of 1 to 100. Final Na + is measured from the each bottle with paste fragments. The solution from the bottles is diluted at the ratio of 1 to 100 and the concentration of the diluted solution was measured for ppm of K+ with the flame photometer Column6=Column3 - Column2 to get the change in the concentration of K+ with respect to the blank bottle Column?= ColumnS- Column4 to get the change in the concentration ofNa +with respect to the blank Conversion of K+ from ppm to mol/L.

.ppendix F: Alkali Leaching Test 13 Weight of the solid content of the paste fragments in each bottle is calculated as the total weight of the paste fragment added to the bottle minus the evaporable and nonevaporable water content of the paste fragments. Since the added paste fragments were dried before soaking in the solution, the evaporable water content does not have to be determined. The non evaporable water content is determined using the loss on ignition furnace by heating to 1050°C. The LOI results are given in the table in a table in this appendix.
