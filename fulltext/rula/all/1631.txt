Abstract
Research on aircraft bleed air systems has been performed at Ryerson University for the last eight years. During this time, the requirements of the test apparatus have been constantly expanding. This thesis work aims at developing a new reconfigurable rig that supports current and future research on aircraft bleed air control systems and takes advantage of lessons learned from previous test rigs. The new rig consists of two temperature control channels in a parallel arrangement to allow for flow sharing control, and a load tank with variable exhaust. Beyond the development of the test rig, research has been

performed to improve mass flow measurement based on signals from traditional thermal mass flow and pressure sensors. The proposed method utilizes these redundant means of indicating flow to obtain fast and accurate flow measurement through the use of a dynamically weighted average. This method has been experimentally investigated using the test rig.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my Professor, G. Liu, for giving me the great privilege of designing and building a test rig for current and future research in the Systems and Controls Laboratory. As well, I would like to express my appreciation for his faith in my abilities, his balanced viewpoint when the project was beginning, and his encouragement during difficult times when nothing seemed to go as planned.

Also, I would like to thank the Ryerson Technical Staff for their help and dedication to this project. Foremost, I would like to acknowledge P. Cresnik for his unwavering support and drive throughout the project. Without his help and expertise, I would have been hard pressed to move the project beyond the initial planning. Among other things, he enabled me to learn a great deal about data acquisition systems in a short period of time, in order to construct the terminal boxes to interface all of the sensors with the computer. In addition, I would also like to thank G. Bootes, H. Ghaemi, and P. Bradley, for their advice and encouragement, donated components, and machining expertise.

Next, I would like to thank the other students in the Systems and Controls Laboratory for their patience during the installation and testing of the system . As well, I would like to thank L. Shang for her help with learning SIMULINK, and S. Shah for his input on the heat exchangers.

Finally, special thanks to my mom and stepdad, Shelley and lan Laird, for their support throughout my university career and my sister, Annalecia, for making sure that I take a break and go out once in a while. I would also like to thank my brother and his wife, Stephen and Lisa, as well as my half-brothers, Eric and Evan, for their patience and understanding during my university career.

1 Introduction
This chapter introduces the overall objectives, topics, and background information of this thesis. In

addition, this chapter provides an overview of prior research performed at the Systems and Control Laboratory of Ryerson University and a survey of publications relevant to this study. The overall organization of this thesis begins with an introduction and literature review, and then discusses the test rig design and construction, before outlining the theoretical algorithm behind the hybrid mass flow method. Experimental results will follow which include calibration results for the sensors, control Finally, conclusions and

system performance, and outputs of the hybrid mass flow algorithm. recommendations for future work will close out this thesis.

1.1 Objectives and Organization
The three primary objectives that form the framework organizing this thesis are listed below:

1.

Development of a Pneumatic System Test Rig. The rig is intended to be used for

the study of controls, diagnostics, prognostics, and health management for aircraft bleed air systems. The rig design is to be based on previous designs and incorporates lessons learned from those designs. Also, the rig should accommodate different types of research so that it may be used for many years to come. Four tasks were identified to complete this primary objective.
Â· System Design.

The requirements and overall design of the test rig were

planned based on current and future research needs, with input from the principal investigator, peers, and technical staff. This design was approved by the principal investigator and specified to the contractors.
Â· Detailed Design. This task included the selection of major components and

the design of terminal boxes for the instrumentation packages by the author with supervision from the technical staff of Ryerson University.
Â· Construction. The test rig was built and certified by the selected contractors.

The instrumentation package was constructed by the author and technical staff at Ryerson University. 1

Â·

Calibration.

After installation, all sensors and actuators were carefully

calibrated by the author and technical staff of Ryerson University. 2.
Development of a Hybrid Flow Sensor Algorithm. This algorithm was developed as

a dynamic weighted average between a fast responding pressure drop flow calculation used during transients and a more accurate thermal flow measurement during steady state. The intention was that this algorithm would lead to more accurate mass flow estimation as well as improved flow control by measuring changes in flow faster. 3.
Validation of the Test Rig and Hybrid Flow Sensor Algorithm. This involved the

actual experiments performed on the rig.

Initial tests were performed to determine

sensor calibration and the basic control system of the test rig. Tests of the hybrid flow sensor algorithm were also performed with satisfactory results.

1.2 Background Information
This thesis requires an understanding of two major aircraft systems as follows:

1. 2.

Bleed Air System Environmental Control System

Furthermore, it requires familiarity with the operation of the following five different types of sensors:

1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

Thermocouples Resistance Temperature Detectors Pressure Sensors or Strain Gauges Thermal Mass Flow Meters Potentiometers

Finally, a simple overview of how sensor fusion ties in all sensors and system functions will be presented.

Note that throughout this thesis, units will predominantly be imperial. This is due to the fact that most of the components were purchased from the USA, and that various standards dealing with the piping are imperial. However, metric has been used where convenient, such as the theoretical section.

1.2.1

Bleed Air System

A wide variety of aircraft systems primarily use pneumatic power, and the turbofan engine is the main pneumatic power source on modern aircraft. The bleed air system connects the pneumatic power users to the source by bleeding air from the turbofan engine compressor, conditioning the air to a safe pressure and temperature, and transporting it to the user.

The most significant difficulty with using bleed air is the variability of the air source at different turbofan power levels. During ground idle and flight idle, the turbofan may not be producing enough pressure or temperature at a specific location of the compressor to power the dependent systems. However, at the same location during takeoff, the turbofan may be producing too much pressure or too high a temperature. Typically, the pressure and temperature during ground idle at the compressor exit are 345 kPa and 180Â°C respectively, but during takeoff the same location can experience a pressure and temperature of 2830 kPa and 540Â°C.

To adapt to this inherent variability, air is bled from different compressor stages using multiple bleed-off valves. Air is bled at a higher pressure and temperature than required, and then conditioned using a pressure-reducing shut-off valve and a pre-cooler to the required working level. The working levels are approximately 275 kPa absolute and 100Â°C.

The pressure-reducing shut-off valve is the component used to restrict downstream pressure to approximately 275 kPa. Typically, the valve is pneumatically operated, electrically controlled, and styled as a butterfly valve.

Immediately downstream of the pressure-reducing shut-off valve is the pre-cooler. Typically, the precooler is a cross-flow heat exchanger, which uses the airflow bled from the turbofan bypass as cooling air. After the pre-cooler, valves direct the conditioned bleed air to the users, such as the Environmental

3

Control System (Moir & Seabridge, Aircraft Systems: Mechanical, Electrical, and Avionics Subsystems Integration, 2008)(Moir & Seabridge, Civil Avionics Systems, 2003}.

1.2.2

Environmental Control System

Passengers and crew should be kept comfortable and safe during their flight; achieving this is the responsibility of the environmental control system (ECS}. The ECS primarily controls cabin pressurization and temperature control, though many other subsystems may fall under its domain, such as anti-icing or anti-misting. Modern aircraft typically condition bleed air further using air cycle machines to achieve the required cabin temperature and fresh air flow. Outflow valves are used to control the pressure inside of the cabin of aircraft with open environmental control systems.

The ventilation requirements specified by the Canadian Air Regulations (CAR} for normal operating conditions are found under CAR 525.831 Ventilation. To paraphrase this section, the aircraft should be designed to deliver at least 0.55 pounds of fresh air per minute for each occupant of the aircraft, or 0.0042 kg/s for each occupant. In addition to ventilation requirements CAR 525.831 also includes cabin temperature limits that vary with exposure time. CAR 525.841 Pressurised Cabins defines how all

pressurized cabins are to be built, with a maximum allowable pressure altitude of 8,000ft, or 2,400m, at maximum altitude of the aircraft at normal operating conditions.

Air cycle machines are primarily used to cool the air and reduce pressure. However, there are many different configurations of the air cycle machine that may be used to achieve this, but the bootstrap system is the most prevalent.

In the most basic bootstrap system, bleed air is passed through a compressor which pressurizes and heats the air. The air is then cooled in a heat exchanger by ram air, before being passed through a turbine. The turbine is mounted on a common shaft with the compressor, the compressor serving as a load to the turbine. Air expands across the turbine, resulting in chilled low pressure air. A bypass valve

4

allows a small amount of hot bleed air to reheat the chilled air, which has just expanded across the turbine, to the level required by the cabin.

Optional components to the basic system depend heavily on the aircraft, and may include some of the following items.

Â·!Â· Multiple Stages. This provides a stepped decrease in temperature for larger airflows
and uses the extracted heat and pressure more efficiently.

Â·!Â· Ram Air Fan. This fan is mounted on the same shaft as the turbine and compressor. It
draws air across the heat exchangers in the ram air channel for cooling during ground operation.

Â·!Â· Jet Pump. This operates on the same principle as the Ram Air Fan, except it uses a
nozzle to blow bleed air downstream of the heat exchangers drawing cool air over the heat exchangers.

Â·!Â· Water Extractor. This component dehumidifies the air upstream of the turbine which
prevents the turbine from icing and extremely moist air from entering the cabin. The water extracted is then sprayed on the heat exchangers inside the ram air channel to provide further cooling. The bootstrap system contains many inefficient processes, not only involving the reductions of pressure and temperature of the bleed air, but also causing increased drag due to the ram air cooled heat exchangers and power loss from large quantities of air being bled from the engines. With rising fuel costs, this is one of the systems being studied to improve aircraft efficiency (Moir & Seabridge, Aircraft Systems: Mechanical, Electrical, and Avionics Subsystems Integration, 2008).

1.2.3

Sensors

Both the bleed air and the environmental control system use a variety of sensors. Likewise, the new test rig also has incorporated a range of sensors. These sensors measure quantities such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, and valve position.

5

1.2.3.1

Thermocouples

An electric potential can be generated when two wires of different materials are connected at both ends with each junction experiencing a different temperature. This is called the Seebeck effect, and it forms the basis of how thermocouples operate. The amount of voltage generated may not be the same as that which is measured due to losses in the connecting wires. Therefore, thermocouples must be calibrated, since thermocouple installation plays a direct role in the final measured output.

Formerly, thermocouples were referenced to a thermojunction mounted in an ice bath (this process is outlined by Doebelin (Doebelin, 1966)). However, new room temperature methods have been

developed that allow the reference junction to be incorporated into the signal conditioner or replaced entirely by different temperature sensing means usually mounted on an isothermal block.

1.2.3.2 Resistance Temperature Detectors
The predictable change of resistance in a conductor as temperature increases forms the basis of resistance temperature detectors. Semiconductor temperature sensors operate on a similar principle and are known as thermistors. measured resistance. A polynomial is used to determine the temperature based on the

For modern instrumentation systems, a four wire constant current system is

commonly used such that resistance variations of the lead wires do not affect the measurement (Doebelin, 1966).

The four wire configuration is now the most commonly used. A constant current flows through one pair of leads, while the other pair measures the voltage drop across the sensor. Lead resistance plays a small role in the final measurement since there is no current in the measurement leads. Keithley suggests a current of 1 mA or less to minimize self heating errors. Fortunately, self heating is minimized when the medium undergoing measurement flows past the sensor head (Keithley Instruments, Inc., 2007).

6

1.z.3.3

Pressure Sensors

Typical pressure transducers operate using strain gauges mounted on small flexible discs, or diaphragms, which are exposed to varying pressures. On one side of the diaphragm is the load pressure being measured and on the other side of the disc is either a vacuum or ambient pressure. A vacuum will result in an absolute pressure measurement, whereas ambient pressure will result in a gauge pressure measurement (Doebelin, 1966). Typically, pressure transducers are made containing the necessary

signal conditioning inside of the sensor housing. (Keithley Instruments, Inc., 2007).

1.2.3.4

Thermal Mass Flow Sensors

There are many types of thermal mass flow sensors, but they all function in a similar manner. Typically, two platinum RTDs are exposed to a gas flow, one sensor is heated and the other is maintained at the current flow temperature. The power required to maintain a preset temperature difference between the two sensors indicates the mass velocity at a point or the total mass flow in a pipe, depending on the sensor design and calibration. Mass velocity is defined as the mass flow rate per unit area; thus, if the cross sectional area of the channel is known, then the total mass flow may be calculated (Olin).

1.2.4 Sensor Fusion
Some introductory work on sensor fusion and fault detection was performed by Day at Ryerson University in 2005 (Day, 2005). Sensor fusion focuses on combining sensor data into a common format with the goal of providing better information than the quality of the individual parts. Typically, this is performed across multiple measurements, but these measurements may be from the same sensor over time or from a multitude of sensors at the same instance in time.

There are several strategies for data fusion that are problem dependent.

This application involves

fusion across different sensors and attributes. Since pressure, temperature, and flow sensors measure different attributes of the same medium, this represents fusion across attributes. However, pressure

7

and temperature data may be used to find flow data, thus making another virtual flow sensor, and allowing data to be fused with respect to different sensors.

It is important to note that the sensors being considered have not faulted, but merely respond differently due to their calibration or individual operating characteristics. This is where sensor fusion can help form a complementary or redundant configuration that gives a more accurate response of what the measured medium is doing (Mitchell, 2007).

1.2.5

Previous Test Rigs

The first pneumatic test rig at Ryerson University was built by Chan in 2001. It was a two channel flow sharing rig built of plastic pipe. Flow rates and pressure drop along the rig were relatively low, on the order of 0.15 lb/s and 7 psig. A basic schematic of the two channel rig is shown below in Figure 1 (Chan, Design, Building, and Experiment on the Bleed Air Sharing Control System Emulation, 2001) .

Bao used the two channel rig to develop a flow sharing algorithm (Bao, 2003L during this time Hardacre was adding an additional two channels to make a four channel flow sharing test rig (Hardacre, 2002). This allowed the master-slave approach to be validated across multiple slave channels. The four channel diagram is shown below in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Four Channel Flow Sharing Test Rig Diagram

Focus shifted from flow sharing to optimal temperature control and heat exchanger analysis under Hodal, Shang, and Shah. A new test rig was built for temperature control, and the ability for flow

sharing was lost with the disassembly of the four channel rig. The introduction of inline air heaters required the use of steel pipe. A diagram of the temperature control rig is shown in Figure 3 (Hodal, 200S)(Shang & Liu, 2007).

Figure 3: Temperature Control Test Rig Diagram

Issues concerning the old rigs focused both on safety and experimental performance. The plastic pipe was acceptable for simple flow sharing tests, but with the application of higher temperatures the plastic pipe could easily loose strength, which forced the transition to steel pipe on the temperature control rig. The temperature control rig was built solidly, but was plagued by sensor placement issues as the topic of research shifted. This resulted in poor installation of sensors, which were subject to leaks. To avoid the

9

safety issue of leaks, no exhaust restrictions were installed in order to keep the channel at a low pressure. Additionally, the bypass valve was not located in the main flow channel, so its effectiveness was reduced since the easiest flow path was directly through the heat exchanger. Finally, the heat

exchanger fouling test performed by Shah had permanently damaged the old heat exchanger.

1.3 Literature Review
Bleed air research has been relatively stagnant in recent years, and most of the energy has been devoted to determining if new electric systems will be able to perform more efficiently than established bleed air systems. However, some modeling work was done by Elangovan on pneumatic ejectors, which are a form of jet pump. Elangovan's work modeled the supporting valves and ducting in the bleed air system to develop a control system that would modulate the valves and ejector flow to achieve cooling as necessary across the pre-cooler (Eiangovan & Brushwood, 1985). This is similar to the work done at Ryerson University involving ram-air plus bypass temperature control schemes.

Research at Ryerson University began with the development of flow sharing by Bao and Hardacre (Bao, 2003) (Hardacre, 2002). This research was performed on the rig initially designed by Chan (Chan, Design, Building, and Experiment on the Bleed Air Sharing Control System Emulation, 2001). Also, a mass flow sensor algorithm was developed by Jiang, and later a digital algorithm by Yiu (Liu, Bao, Lam, & Jiang, 2005)(Jiang, Liu, & Jiang, 2005) (Yiu, 2004). Hodal started research on heat exchanger modeling, and this was furthered by Shang in the area of temperature control. The temperature control scheme used by Shang involved modulating flow in the ram air channel and heat exchanger bypass channel. This allowed for optimal control of the outlet temperature during transients (Hodal, 2005)(Shang & Liu, 2007). Most of the above research has played a role in the development of the new rig. This research has culminated in a patent for the flow sharing algorithm (Liu & Lam, 2003).

Many companies and universities are researching electric systems to meet the More-Electric Aircraft concept. Ensign has been performing analysis on an electric environmental control system for Cessna business jets for several years (note that in many cases the environmental control system includes the bleed air system). Essentially, Ensign suggests the replacement of the traditional bleed air system with electric compressors, so that the engine only needs to produce thrust and electricity. Electric

compressors will provide pressurization and conditioning through traditional air cycle machines, and heating grids will meet anti-icing requirements (Ensign & Gallman, Energy Optimized Equipment Systems for General Aviation Jets, 2006)(Ensign, AIAA 2007-1395, 2007)(Ensign, Sensitivity Studies of Electric Systems on Business Jet Range, 2008) .

Furthermore, the More-Electric Aircraft concept is undergoing exergl analysis by several other authors to determine if it actually is more efficient. Slingerland states that the largest difficulty in comparing bleed air systems to electric systems is the inability to compare the off-takes directly. However, through the use of a gas turbine simulation program Slingerland concludes that electrical engine off-takes are less efficient than pneumatic off-takes, but the electrical systems operate much more efficiently resulting in a 2% improvement of thrust specific fuel consumption over the equivalent pneumatic system (Slingerland & Zandstra, 2007).

The effects of bleed air extraction on thrust were measured by NASA on an F404-GE-400 turbofan engine used in the F/A-18 High-Alpha Research Vehicle. This research found that at military power, a 1% increase of bleed flow results in a 2% decrease of thrust. However, this flow was to be used for flight

"Exergy is defined as the maximum work obtained by an energy carrier, when it is brought into equilibrium with the environment, through reversible processes with common components of the environment." (Pellegrini, Gandolfi, & Lima da Silva, 2007)

control purposes at a high angle-of-attack rather than the environmental control system (Yuhas & Ray, 1992).

Buss brings an interesting viewpoint to the debate concerning electric system performance compared to bleed air system performance. This viewpoint involves the aircraft type and the usage of the aircraft as an entire system. Most aircraft can be loosely classified into transport, patrol, or fighter classes. Each class has a vastly different set of requirements to meet, and different possible solutions to meet these requirements which are explained below:

Â·!Â· Transport Aircraft. Due to the large number of people on board, these aircraft have
very large fresh air and pressurization requirements. The current air cycle system being used is considered optimum, with potential savings to be found in the improvement of bleed air systems or a switch to electric compressors.

Â·!Â· Patrol Aircraft. Due to the large amount of high density electronic equipment on
board, air conditioning would be most efficiently handled by a vapor cycle system. However, for the small amount of air required for fresh air and pressurization, the normal bleed air system could be used .

Â·!Â· Fighter Aircraft. It is difficult to determine which method is most efficient due to the
dependency on the actual aircraft design and heat rejection requirements. In overview, Buss states that the environmental control system design is highly subject to the mission of the aircraft, and that the method to be used should be evaluated for each aircraft (Buss, 1984).

Simulation of an environmental control system was performed by Eichler, but very little is mentioned about the actual method used. Look-up tables and correction values seem to be heavily used to force the simulation to match the actual test system (Eichler, 1975).

Sensor fusion has typically been used in imaging fields with multiple sensors of the same type employed over a period of time (Rathburn & Washburne, 1993). Similar techniques have been used to determine the location of flow reattachment after a separation due to a step in the flow. This method used an 12

array of flush mounted pressure sensors and interpolation of the data to find the reattachment point (Humphreys & Culliton, 2008). With respect to aircraft, sensor fusion has been increasingly used for positioning of unmanned aerial vehicles. For vertical positioning, the output of a laser altimeter was fused with data from a radar altimeter to give a more accurate altitude reading to an unmanned aircraft (Accardo, Esposito, Cimmino, Moccia, Ciniglio, & Corraro, 2004). For horizontal positioning, a method of fusing data from the Global Positioning System with the inertial navigation system data has been developed (Jarrell, Gu, Seanor, & Napolitano, 2008).

1.4 Purpose
The primary purpose of this thesis was to develop a flow sharing and temperature control test rig. The new rig was intended to be able to merge the two previously studied topics with more flexibility in sensing and control. Additionally, it was intended to provide a solid record of the individual sensor calibration used by the SIMULINK control system. Key research in this thesis involved the development of a hybrid sensor algorithm that was intended to have the rapid response of a head loss flow meter, such as an orifice plate flow meter, but the steady state accuracy of a thermal flow sensor. Experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the hybrid algorithm on the actual system and to demonstrate how the algorithm improved control performance of the system.

Test Rig

In this section, the overall design and operation of the test rig is presented. In addition, this section describes the requirements of the new test rig, the finalized design, and outlines some of the issues encountered during construction. explained. Major components, sensors, and the control system are also

2.1 Requirements
The purpose of the test rig is to provide a reconfigurable platform to perform experiments combining past research of flow sharing and temperature control with new research on sensor fusion, analytical redundancy, and prognostics. The new test rig shall have two temperature control channels that

exhaust into a load tank. The load tank will have a single controllable outflow channel, and the two channels will be individually controllable and decoupled to allow for flow sharing. This setup shall allow for simultaneous flow, temperature, and pressure control in the load tank. Pressure control of a load tank has not been included in previous test rigs since they were exhausted directly to ambient conditions. Besides accommodating flow sharing, a twin channel rig allows for physical redundancy and flexibility in new research fields such as fault detection, identification, and accommodation.

Fixed operating conditions shall consist of a maximum working pressure of 90 psi, or 620 kPa, with a maximum temperature of 200Â°F, or 366 K, downstream of the heater.

This rig shall be registered with the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) of Canada. Hearing protection will be required in the lab. Other safety concerns involve pressure release valves on the tanks, and upper temperature limits placed on the heaters, and programmed into the heater controllers.

14

Wiring and connections for sensors shall be properly shielded, with all shields grounding at a common location inside of the junction box. The ground should be isolated from the rig to avoid ground loops. All wiring diagrams shall be recorded in this thesis, and a copy kept in the testing facility.

sensor calibration will be performed on the rig with the process and results recorded in this thesis.

2.2 Design and Construction
The overall design was checked and stamped by the engineering contractor Teng and Associates Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario). The drawings were registered with the TSSA, and the rig itself was certified by the TSSA. Lemico Liquids (Mississauga, Ontario) was the subcontractor who built and installed the rig at Ryerson University. Lessons learned from previous test rigs were as follows:

Â·!Â· Two Channels. This allowed flow sharing capabilities and redundant channels for fault
simulation and experimentation.

Â·!Â· Straight through Heat Exchanger Bypass. One of the primary lessons learned from
the temperature control rig was low pressure drop across the heat exchanger reduced effectiveness of the bypass control valve. A mechanically linked T valve and straight through bypass was included in the new rig to improve bypass flow control.

Â·!Â· Common 2" Diameter Piping. This allows for simpler building and modeling due to
reduced diameter changes.

Â·!Â· Supply and Load Tanks. The supply tanks were added to allow for increased test
duration. They also effectively increased available pressure since the pressure can be maintained in the lab rather than the supply room; thus, experiments are not affected by pressure losses due to air flowing to the rig from the supply room. The load tank was also a new addition that allowed for new research in pressurization and further validation of past flow control schemes.

Â·!Â· Butterfly Valves. Previous control schemes were intended to be used with butterfly
valves, but small diameter ball valves were used instead. Most sources agree that

butterfly valves function better as throttling devices (Smith & Zappe, 2004).

15

Â·!Â· Common Sensor Pads. This rig must be reconfigurable. By using common sensor
pads and machined bushings, sensors can be moved virtually anywhere on the rig easily. However, consideration was given to how the sensors operate, since some sensors do not perform well around obstructions.

Â·!Â· Calibration.

Information on the calibration of old sensors and wiring diagrams of

instrumentation are difficult to find for previous rigs, if they exist at all. Calibration and sensor performance has been taken under careful consideration in the design and construction of the instrumentation package for this rig. The calibration method used, equipment, and results were recorded so that they may be replicated in the future as necessary. The following design was delivered to Teng and Associates to be revised to meet TSSA certification requirements and design of structural supports. The drawings were modified as needed and stamped by Teng and Associates before being registered with the TSSA. The official drawings are reproduced in Appendix A.

Figure 4 shows an isometric view of the test rig as it was modeled and presented to Teng and Associates in December 2008. As can be seen, three air tanks were used, two for supply and one for load.

Between the supply and load tanks are the primary 'bleed' channels, which are heated and split between the bypass and heat exchanger lines before merging and exhausting into the load tank. The heat exchanger is cooled by the 'ram air' channels, which like the outlet channel are exhausted directly to the surroundings. The ram air channels are supplied by either the building air supply, or the supply tank of the opposite bleed channel. Specifically, the right tank provides air for the top bleed air channel and the lower ram air channel, whereas the left tank provides air for the bottom bleed air channel and top ram air channel. This was done to completely decouple the air sources, and provide longer duration running for temperature control tests.

Each section of the rig will now be discussed and major components labeled. First is the supply end, which consists of a 1" pipe split by a T before being plumbed into the two laboratory supply tanks. Manual and check valves are used to allow filling of a single tank, and not allow cross flow between tanks as they are emptied during tests. If cross-flow is required for a test, the cross-flow valve may be opened. The location of these components is labeled in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Conceptual View of Supply Lines and Tanks

After the supply tanks, air would either enter the bleed air or ram air channels. The bleed channel leaves its respective tank via manual valve followed by a 90Â° elbow. An electrically actuated butterfly valve is used to throttle the flow in the channel. After the main control valve, air is heated before being diverted through the heat exchanger. The Tee butterfly valve is electrically actuated and set to normally close off the bypass line. The air is cooled passing through the heat exchanger, before merging with the bypass flow and entering the downstream pipe. A cross-flow pipe is used to divert both flows to the same channel for stronger coupling effect if it is required. However, normal operation would have the flows being exhausted directly into the load tank. Figure 6 depicts the bleed air channels, along with their heat exchanger and bypass lines, and other major components. Threaded connections are used throughout the rig in conjunction with flanged connections around components that may need occasional servicing or replacement.

The two bleed air channels also form the main flow sharing channels of the rig. The ram air channels are used to complete the temperature control requirements of each channel. channel can be from either the laboratory tanks or the building air supply. Supply for the ram air Flow is controlled via

butterfly valve, and is passed directly through the heat exchanger before being exhausted to the surroundings. This is shown in Figure 7.

Tank 1

Figure 7: Conceptual View of Single Temperature Control Channel

Also obvious in Figure 7 is the decoupled nature of the temperature control channels. The bleed air channel and ram air channel each are supplied by a separate tank. Optionally, the ram air may be supplied by the building rather than the laboratory. It is arranged such that Bleed Air Channel 1 (BA1) is

19

supplied by Tank 1, and Bleed Air Channel 2 (BA2) is supplied by Tank 2. Also, Tank 1 supplies Ram Air Channel 2 (RAM2), and Tank 2 supplies Ram Air Channel 1 (RAM1), as shown in Figure 7. The final channel is the Outflow Channel {OC). The OC control valve affects the pressure in Tank 3 by controlling the outflow rate. It is shown below in Figure 8.

Outflow

Figure 8: Conceptual View of the Outflow Channel

There is a high part commonality that was intentionally built into the rig to simplify construction . Sensor pads were added to three specific lengths of pipe, the drawings for which are specified in Appendix A: TSSA Approved Drawings. The 86" pipe was designed to meet the installation recommendations for the FMA900 Series flow sensors which requires at least 20 diameters of pipe between an upstream elbow or branch and a flow sensor. Additionally, it is recommended that at least five diameters downstream of the pipe be made available. Therefore the 86" pipe was designed to allow for 40" of clear flow The 30" downstream easily exceeds the

upstream of the flow sensor pad, and 30" downstream.

required 5 diameters, but it also allows for an additional flow sensor to be mounted in the channel for calibration or redundancy if the research topic demands.

20

The 12" pipes were simply intended to be used as a general means of adding more sensor positions to the rig, particularly around components of interest, such as the valves and heat exchangers. This was done to avoid the problem of not having the necessary sensor positions that plagued previous rigs whenever the research focus was shifted.

The 8" pipes were late additions, but are intended to provide a mounting position for the RTDs just before Tank #3, as well as the primary temperature control points of the rig. However, the possibility also exists to mount a sensor to the side of the tank.

The pictures shown below were taken on July 30, 2009. All of the valves in the bottom channel are operational, as well as the outflow valve. No heaters have been mounted, and the top channel, and all ram air channels are awaiting actuator mounting. Figure 9 shows the air supply to the rig. Both supply lines are closed in this case. The "Lab" supply line is the normal source of air, and this line is filtered and may also be regulated. The "Building" supply is a backup source and may be used for ram air supply or an initial pressure charge for the tanks. The "Crossflow Valve" is used to allow equalized pressures in both supply tanks for single channel running and it is opened in the picture. The "Supply Valves" located at the bottom, are used to select which tank to charge. In this case, Supply #2, which charges Tank #2, is opened, whereas Supply #1 is closed. However, since the cross-flow valve is opened. Both tanks will be charged.

Figure 10 is a picture from the middle of the rig, looking back towards the supply. The tee connection in the center of the photograph is where the building supply enters the rig. The tee valves, such as the "Ram Air Source Selector" allow for either the building supply or air from the tank to be used. "Ram Valve #1" is an addition that was not used in the initial drawings, it aids in completely isolating the supply tanks, rather than depending on the tee valves alone. The actuated valve shown is for controlling the airflow in the channel "Bleed #2" (BA2). The corresponding valve in channel "Bleed #1" (BA1) does not have an actuator mounted in this picture.

22

Figure 10: Photograph of Supply Side of Test Rig

Figure 11 is another photograph viewing back towards the supply, from closer to Tank #3. Here the ram air channels are clearly seen as well as the heat exchangers and bypass channels. The "Actuated Tee Valve" is located in the BA2 channel and will be used to direct airflow through or around the heat exchanger. This valve also has the actuator mounted. The valves intended to control the ram air

channels do not have their actuators mounted. Figure 12 is a photograph of the opposite angle looking towards the load tank and more clearly showing the BA1 channel, as well as the RAM1 channel. At the exit of RAM1 is a reducing elbow. The elbow is intended to serve as a restriction as well as a means of directing flow downwards in a safe direction. Eventually, all of the exit elbows will be painted yellow as a high visibility caution.

The exhaust end of the rig is shown in Figure 13. The "Outflow Control Valve" is operational, and the reducer elbow is shown at the exit. Additionally, a bushing has also been installed to further restrict the exit flow and provide back pressure. Sensors mounted in this channel are also visible. They are an omega PX209 pressure sensors (Laval, Quebec) at the entrance and exit of the channel, with an Omega FMA905 (Laval, Quebec) flow sensor located in the middle.

Major Components

The following sections highlight most of the major components of the rig. Component specifications and the reasons as to why a particular component was chosen are provided. For components with poor specifications, whatever information is known will be presented here, as well as any information that was assumed for testing or simulation. Where possible, this assumed information will be verified, and the results recorded here.

2.2.1.1

Tanks

complement the old tanks mounted in the supply room. According to Bao, each old tank had a volume

26

of approximately S1,300 in

,

or approximately 220 gal. (Bao, 2003) The new tanks each contain 120 gal,

total storage capacity of the new rig is approximately 680 gal of air at 125 psi. The new tanks are able

to hold air up to 200 psi, but the compressor seems to supply a maximum pressure of 125 psi. Besides increased supply, the new tanks were also intended to decouple the supply air by increasing the volume directly upstream of the main control valves. The three new tanks, part number A10049, were supplied from Steei-Fab Tanks (Oakville, Ontario). All of the tanks are equipped with drain valves, analog

pressure gauges, and pressure relief valves which are set to 90 psig.

2.2.1.2 Heaters
The heaters chosen for this rig are the Farnam HT200 heaters with the Farnam Series 7550-A40 controllers. The 8.0 kW heaters are rated from 19.3 standard cubic feet of air per minute (SCFM) to 100 SCFM, and have a maximum exhaust temperature of 1300Â°F. This exhaust limit will be reduced to 200Â°F maximum on the rig, and the flow switch will be used to prevent the heaters from turning on at flow rates less than 19.3 SCFM. The heaters use K-Type thermocouples for controller feedback. The

maximum allowable pressure for these heaters is 120 psig (Farnam-Tutco).

Though these heaters are rated to higher flow rates and pressures than the SureHeat Jet inline heater from Sylvania used on the old rig, (OSRAM Sylvania) there were some issues with certification that arose during delivery of the test rig. Specifically, the Farnam controllers did not come with full CSA approval, and the heaters do not have CRN numbers. The previously used SureHeat Jet heater had a maximum allowable working pressure of only 60 psi, so the new heaters can withstand much higher pressures (C-T Products Company). The heater controllers were subsequently CSA certified and their installation

registered with the ESA (certification stickers are in place on the controller boxes).

The new Farnam heater controllers do have a number of user specified safeguards in place that the old controller did not have. First, there is a high temperature limit shut-off switch that makes use of the

27

downstream K-type thermocouple, and second there is a flow input switch that shuts off the unit if low flow is detected. This switch will be signaled from the PC, allowing semi-manual switching from the work station.

However, due to complications certifying these heaters, they have not yet been installed. Proof tests performed on the heaters produced a small crack in the casing in the heat affected zone near the thermocouple mounting junctions at 130 psig; however, this is well above the normal operating range of 20 psig at the heater.

2.2.1.3

Valves

There are nine basic types of manual control valves available, and each type of valve lends itself to particular applications. A brief description of each valve is presented below:

Â·!Â· Globe Valves. These are a closing-down valve type that can be used to throttle flow. However,
they do cause a large flow resistance due to their shape.

Â·!Â· Piston Valves. These work similarly to globe valves as they are another type of closing-down
valve, but use the sides of the piston as the sealing face. They also may be used to throttle flow, and handle solids in suspension well. They are also subject to a large flow resistance.

Â·!Â· Parallel Gate Valves. These valves are a type of slide valve, where a disc slides across the
opening area and gets forced back against the seal by the upstream pressure. Typically, these valves are used as shut-off valves, but due to their small size, they have very low flow resistance when fully open. They do not seal well in low pressure applications.

Â·!Â· Wedge Gate Valves. Similar to the parallel gate valve, the only difference is a wedge-shaped
plug that allows for low pressure applications, in addition to the high pressure shut-off application that the parallel gate valve excels in.

Â·!Â· Plug Valves. Generic plug valves are a rotary valve with that is ported to allow flow through.
These valves work best as shut-off valves or in flow diverting applications. Though plug valves may be used to throttle flow, leaving a plug valve partially opened may deform the seal, which may either lock the valve in place, or cause it to leak.

Â·!Â· Ball Valves. Ball Valves are a widely used subset of plug valves with a spherical plug.

28

Â·!Â· Butterfly ' Valves. These valves use a disc that rotates in the flow, and serve very well at
throttling flow. angles. Butterfly valves provide sensitive flow control between 15Â° and 70Â° opening

Â·!Â· Pinch Valves. These valves use a flexible body to restrict flow. This allows for a restriction
without any obstruction to the flow, which makes them ideal for slurries and other solid suspension flows. However, the flexible body does need to be replaced frequently as it ages to avoid rupture due to aging and wear.

Â·!Â· Diaphragm Valves.

These are another type of flexible body valve.

However, diaphragm

valves restrict flow by deforming a diaphragm towards a rigid surface to restrict flow or create a seal. This method does not require as much deformation as a pinch valve, and therefore can last longer. All of the above valves may be fitted with actuators for automated control, or handles for manual control. However, some types of valves function automatically and require no user input.

Â·!Â· Check Valves. These mechanically prevent flow in the reverse direction by opening in forward
flow and closing in reverse flow.

Â·!Â· Pressure Relief Valves. These valves automatically open at a preset pressure to blow off any
excess pressure in the system. Alternatively, they may reduce a vacuum by allowing air into the system. Pressure relief valves protect the entire system from damage due to over-pressure or under-pressure conditions. Based on the above information from Smith (Smith & Zappe, 2004), the valves discussed below were selected. The butterfly valves were specified by Ryerson University, and they are the primary means of flow control in the test rig. applications. The manual ball valves are used both in shut-off and flow diverting

Check valves serve to prevent undesired cross-flow between supply tanks, and the

pressure relief valves from Kunkle (Lake Villa, Illinois, USA) were selected by Teng and Associates and set to 90 psi to protect downstream components, specifically the heat exchangers from over-pressurization.

29

2.2.1.3.1 Electrically Actuated Butterfly Valves
Due to familiarity with controlling Bi-Torq (La Fox, Illinois, USA) valves from the past, they were selected as the supplier for the new valves. The same basic actuator was used, but more options were added. The valve body itself was changed from a %" ball valve to a 2" butterfly valve. The specifications for the valves are listed below (Bi-Torq, 2008).

Â·

30

Unfortunately, a certification issue arose concerning these valves. The Bi-Torq valves did not have valid eRN numbers. These valves were switched to an equivalent valve from FNW (Portland, Oregon, USA) that had the necessary certifications.

The butterfly valves were used to modulate, or throttle, flow rates throughout the rig. They can also be used as temporary shut-off valves, though ball-valves have been incorporated to serve as the primary means of supply selection and shut-off.

In the event that the butterfly valves require too small an opening area to provide effective control restrictor plates or reducers can be placed at the outlets of the rig to provide back pressure. The downstream restriction is not that much of an issue however, since it was already planned to have elbows in place for directing the outflow in a safe manner. A 2"x1" reducing street elbow was used in conjunction with a reducing bushing to direct flow exhaust and provide the necessary flow restriction.

Figure 15 shows the controller card mounted on each actuator. There are three variable resistors for tuning the on-board valve controller, and they are labeled in the image. The resistor labeled "Span" is used for setting the fully opened position and the "Zero" resistor is used for setting the fully closed position. The "Deadband" resistor determines the smallest increment in control signal for which the actuator will adjust. If the dead band is set too small, it is possible to destroy the actuator gearing, but if it is set too large, fine control of the valve will be lost. The fuse has also been labeled. Figure 16 shows the valves in roughly closed and opened positions.

2.2.1.3.2 Manual Ball Valves
These valves were installed to provide a sure means of flow shut-off and air supply selection. Two-port ball valves were used as simple shut-off valves at the inlet and exits of the main supply tanks. This allowed for a clear visual of the present flow arrangement of the rig, and allows any channel to be locked out for maintenance purposes. Tee-type three-port ball valves are used for two purposes: Firstly, the three-port valves serve as a means to select which air supply to use for the ram air channels, and

32

secondly the valves serve to merge the exhaust flows of the bleed channels before exhausting to the load tank. These valves were not intended to be used to throttle flow, but may be required due to the large butterfly valves being used.

2.2.1.3.3 Check Valves
The check valves were installed just before the inlet of the supply tanks as shown in Figure 5. Check valves allow the tanks to exhaust at different flow rates while being simultaneously filled by the compressor and preventing any cross flow between the tanks. However, for the most extreme case of source decoupling, complete isolation of the tanks via shut-off valves would be the best method.

2.2.1.3.4 Pressure Relief Valves
The pressure relief valves were selected by Teng and Associates, and set for a maximum of 90 psig. It was found that a normal operating pressure of 60 psig with the load tank maintained at 20 psig provided a maintainable flow rate greater than 1000 standard feet per minute (SFPM) for single channel operation.

2.2.1.4 Heat Exchangers
The heat exchangers were designed in cooperation by Ryerson Technical staff and Teng and Associates. They are similar to the heat exchanger used on the previous temperature control rig, but were certified by TSSA. The heat exchangers were found to be limited to 93.3 psig, thereby determining the pressure relief valve setting of 90 psig.

A wide variety of sensors were incorporated into the test rig, and the general theory of their operation was explained in Section 1.2.3. The specifications and part numbers of the sensors used on the test rig are shown in the following sections.

33

2.2.2.1

Thermocouples

The Omega T-Type thermocouples, with part number TC-T-NPT-E-72, were used on the rig along with Omega thermocouple signal conditioners, with part number DRF-TCT-24VDC-0/200C-0/10. The thermocouples are mounted in a X" NPT fitting with an exposed junction which allows for faster response. The signal produced by the sensor is very weak and nonlinear, but the conditioner used with the sensor converts the signal to a linear 0-10 Vdc signal that can be easily acquired by the computer. The 0-10V range of the conditioners correspond to a temperature range of

ooc

to 200Â°C, and the

conditioners have a response time of 250ms. Additionally, the heater has two K-Type thermocouples that are connected to the heater controller. These K-Type thermocouples are used for temperature feedback by the heater controller as well as the high temperature shut-off sensor. The T-Type

thermocouples may be used for measuring temperature throughout the rig as experiments require.

2.2.2.2 Resistance Temperature Detectors
Proprietary suppliers donated aircraft resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) for experimentation at Ryerson University. However, no documentation was given with these sensors so analysis was

performed to determine the type of RTD and what wiring method would allow for the best performance. A resistance check was performed across pairs of pins using an Omega CA150 Handheld Calibrator in an ice water bath maintained at

ooc.

The readings shown in Table 1 were for the RTDs with

serial numbers 113C-0203 and 100C-123. Both sensors performed similarly so only one table is shown.

Therefore, it was concluded that the RTDs each contained two 5000 sensing elements, and that each sensing element could be wired as a 4-wire constant current RTD. Another concern was that the

excitation current may vary as the resistance of the RTD changes. Therefore, the excitation current from the Nl PCI6704 output card was checked and confirmed to remain constant using a 1k0 precision rheostat. The pin information of the sensor itself is shown at the bottom of Table 1. A custom plastic adapter was made to protect the top of the RTD and provide a Preh connector for easier lead wire connection.

2.2.2.3 Pressure Transducers
All pressure sensors available to be used on the rig are tabulated below.

Range 0-100 psig 0-100 psig 0-300 psig 0-30 psia 0-200 psig

The five PX219 Sensors were purchased specifically for this rig. The PX219 series differ from the PX209 and PX303 by the inclusion of a four-pin DIN Connector rather than a lead wire. This allows for easier rewiring of the sensor. The 200 psig range was selected due to the design maximum operating pressure of 120 psig. This was purchased before the maximum operating pressure was found to be 90 psig.

2.2.2.4 Flow Sensors
Two different flow sensor models are used on the rig, though they operate on the same principals. No documentation existed for one of the flow sensor models. However, information on the Omega flow sensors is provided here. Two flow speed sensors from the previous test rig were Omega FMA905 series flow sensors, with an operating range of 0-5000 SFPM (standard feet per minute). Standardized flow

35

rate may be calculated if the cross sectional area of the pipe is known and it would be given in SCFM (standard cubic feet per minute). Standard denotes that the value corresponds to flow at standard temperature and pressure conditions. The actual mass flow in pounds per second or kilograms per second may then be calculated by dividing by standard atmospheric density, and considering the pipe diameter in which the sensor is mounted.

A new flow sensor with NIST traceability will be purchased and used on the rig to calibrate the other four flow sensors. All sensors will be calibrated to output measurements in SFPM. This allows for the sensors to make accurate readings regardless of the pipe diameter in which the sensor is located. Calibration information is located in Section 2.4.

Once all flow sensors were hooked up and operational, it was found that the actual signal range of the proprietary thermal flow sensors was 0-5 Vdc.

2.2.2.5 Potentiometers
These 10 kO potentiometers are found on the controllers and provide 0-10 Vdc output based on the valve angular position. Since they only rotate 90Â°, readings typically have an approximate range

between 3 V and 6 V. They are to be used to provide the actual position of the valve for calculations requiring the valve opening area, rather than assuming the valve opening is equal to the commanded value. The potentiometers may also allow for further valve hysteresis study in the future. (Chan,

Conflicts between 64bit Vista and SIMULINK Real -time Windows Target required 32bit Windows XP to be installed on the system. The hard drive has been split into two partitions. One partition is for the operating system and programs, and the other is for data and program files.

2.3 Instrumentation
To connect the sensors to the computer required a large amount of wiring and connections. The

connections were sorted between two terminal boxes which have been mounted in the rack. One box handled the pressure sensors, thermocouples, and actuator potentiometers, and the other box handled flow sensors, RTDs, actuator excitation, and the heater controller flow switch.

Both instrumentation boxes and the control computer are mounted in a movable rack, which is shown in Figure 17. The rack is shown with the door both opened and closed.

routing the signal wires to the terminal boards, power sources, or shielding ground. However, fuses, switches, terminal blocks, and pin connections for the Preh connectors are also shown in the diagrams.

2.3.2

Construction
Originally the boxes were

Construction of the boxes spanned from December 2008 to April 2009.

intended to only be used for shielded connections. However, additional components such as switches and fuses were added to increase protection of the components inside of the boxes, specifically the flow sensor boards and thermocouple conditioners. Short circuit protection was also provided for all power circuits.

38

The boxes were purchased without any cutouts. The cutouts were machined using drills and hand tools such as a nibbler and files. Large components were then mounted in the boxes, specifically the terminal boards, thermocouple conditioners, screw terminals, and flow sensor boards. Once fit was checked, all connectors and switches were installed, and wiring began.

Some changes in the original wiring were performed, specifically on the RTDs as additional information about their operation was found as shown in Section 2.2.2.2.

Overall, wire color consistency was attempted to be achieved for all connections of a given type. This can be seen from the wiring diagrams of Appendix B and the pictures shown below. Custom connectors were made by Ryerson Technical Staff for the RTDs and Flow Sensors. The pin-outs are also shown in Appendix B.

Access to the box can be achieved via the front panel while the box is mounted in the rack. However, this is limited to observation only. To service the box, it should be fully removed from the rack, and the internal components may be easily accessed from the top panel. No provision has been made for the sides, bottom, or back panel to be removed.

2.3.2.1

Terminal Box #1

The first box is the main data acquisition terminal box. It contains all of the terminal connections for pressure transducers, thermocouples, and potentiometers. Terminal Box #1 (TB1) uses 27 channels of a total capacity of 32 single ended analog data acquisition channels available on the National Instruments PCI-6224 M-Series Board mounted on the computer. Figure 18 shows the front panel of TB1 with main the components labeled. The thermocouple conditioner fuses are rated to 250 mA, and there is one fuse for each conditioner. The two short circuit fuses, TMAIN and PMAIN, require 3 A and 375 mA fuses respectively. The switches allow power to the specified sensors, and the indicator light is lit when the circuit is powered. 39

Figure 18: Front Panel Photograph of Terminal Box #1

Figure 19 is a picture of the inside of the box, as it would appear when the top is removed for servicing. At the bottom of the picture is the front panel, with the fuse connections and switches. The large Anderson connector bundle is used to disconnect the front panel when the box is rack mounted. Thermocouple conditioners are DIN rail mounted along the sides of the box. The green boards are both National Instruments CB-68LPR terminal boards used to route signal wires into the 68-pin cable that connects to the computer. Each board can handle 16 channels, with the left board being filled to

capacity with nine channels used by thermocouples and seven channels used by potentiometers. The right board has 5 spare channels with 11 used by the pressure transducers.

Internal wiring of the box was kept as consistently as possible. The blue sheathed wire with blue and red conductors is T-Type thermocouple extension wire, used to patch between the connectors and conditioners. Red and black wires are typically used for power or excitation of the pressure transducers and conditioners. Green and black are pressure transducer signal wires, with white and black for

thermocouple signals, and blue and black for potentiometer signals. Ground wire colours vary from connector to connector, but are typically brown for pressure transducer connectors, green for potentiometer connectors, and black for thermocouple connectors.

40

Figure 19: Top Internal Photograph of Terminal Box #1

Figure 20 is a rear view of TBl. It shows three power connections on the bottom left, a 5 Vdc, 24 Vdc, and a spare. The 5 Vdc provides power to the indicator lights on the front panel, as well as a grounding route for all shielding. The 24 Vdc connection provides power for the thermocouple conditioners and pressure transducers. 7-pin Preh connectors numbered 1-11 are the pressure transducer connectors. The blue connectors numbered 17-15 are used for the thermocouples, and the 4-pin Preh connectors numbered 25-32 are used for the potentiometers. There are two spare Preh connectors in this box for future expansion. Thermocouple wire shielding will be connected to ground via the screw terminals labeled with TSHIELD.

41

2.3.2.2

Terminal Box #2

Terminal Box #2 (TB2) is used for actuator excitation and sensors that may require computer controlled excitation, such as the RTDs. Additionally, it also provides data acquisition for all of the flow sensors. It has a capacity of 32 analog outputs split between 16 voltage and 16 current output channels, and eight digital input/output channels. Furthermore, it also has 16 single ended analog data acquisition

channels. Eleven of the current output channels are being used, split between seven actuators and four RTD elements. Two digital channels are being used for the heater controller flow switches. Eleven of the data acquisition channels are being used, two for flow sensors, four for RTDs and five for Omega flow sensors.

Figure 21 shows the front panel of TB2. It has a similar arrangement to TB1, but has switches for each flow sensor. The RTDs do not require switches since they are excited by the computer. Provision was made for five Omega flow sensors, though only three are planned to be used currently. The Omega flow sensors are protected by 375 mA fuses, and the other flow sensors are protected by 500 mA fuses. The spare switches and fuses are not currently hooked up.

42

Figure 21: Front Panel Photograph of Terminal Box #2

Similar to TB1, Figure 22 shows the inside of TB2 as viewed when the top access panel is removed . The bottom left is where the flow sensor conditioner cards are located for the proprietary flow sensors. Four cards are mounted though only two are being used. They are numbered one through four, with cards two and four being used . No wiring diagrams are available for these cards. The left green board is the SCB-68 used for signal excitation. Analog excitation wires are blue and white pairs, with digital excitation as black and white . Red and black wires are used for power, while green and black are used for acquired signals.

The back panel of TB2, shown in Figure 23, has been labeled to show the current usage of connectors. The Anderson connectors along the bottom are used for power, with 5 Vdc again being used to power the indicator lights and provide shielding ground, 28 Vdc are used for flow sensor excitation, and five 15 Vdc connectors for each of the Omega flow sensor channels. There are three spare Preh connectors for future expansion. Flow sensor connectors are numbered 1 and 2, with RTOs labeled 3 and 4. Omega flow sensors are numbered 5 through 7, 13, and 14. Actuator Excitation connectors are labeled 117 through 123, with the heater controller flow switch labeled 002/003. The flow switch connector carries signals for both boxes, so it is required to be split near the controller boxes.

2.3.2.3 Extension Wires
Potentiometer and control signal connectors are sent to their respective control actuator via a two wire patch cable between the two boxes and a four wire cable to the actuator. Two 4-pin male connectors are used to interface with the box connectors, and are joined in a single 8-pin female connector. An 8pin male connector connects to the patch cable female 8-pin connector. The six wire lead extension

44

terminates in an 8-pin female connector near the actuator, which then plugs into the actuator signal lead wire.

The pressure sensor 7-pin female connector on the box is connected to the 7-pin male connector on the six wire lead extension cable. The lead extension terminates in an 8-pin connector which then plugs into the sensor lead wire.

The RTD lead extension is reversible with two 8-pin male connectors and a six wire cable.

The

connectors plug into the sensor and the box directly. The thermocouple lead wires plug into the lead extensions, all of which are T-Type wire for those that are used in rig control. K-Type sensors are used for the heater controllers, and these are yellow.

The flow sensor wires are composed similarly to the RTD wires, but have an eight wire lead extension cable. However, the Omega flow sensors are connected to the box with an 8-pin connector, but connect directly to the sensor by a 7-pin DIN connector via a six wire lead extension.

All sensors are to be calibrated in the final mounting configuration. For example, the final configuration would be routed from the box via lead extension, to lead wires and finally the sensor. Once calibrated, the final configuration will be labeled so that the wires can be easily reconnected in the same format when necessary. Whenever a sensor is to be used with a lead wire other than what it was originally calibrated with, the new configuration should be recalibrated. Most of the sensors require the lead

extensions to be in place to be operational and efforts were made to ensure that if any connector is plugged into the wrong position, no harm would come to the sensor or data acquisition system.

A breakout box was also made for use with the rig to aid in connection, and pin identification. It was comprised of two 9-pin terminal blocks at the top, labeled with shield and pins 1 through 8. Two male and two female 8-pin Preh connectors are used to interface with any of the sensors utilizing an 8-pin

45

connection . This allows for easy pin identification and voltage measuring for the pressure sensors, flow sensors, and RTDs.

2.4 Calibration
Each sensor was calibrated to a standard as explained in each sensor subsection. When available, a calibrating unit was used, otherwise the sensors were calibrated to a common sensor. All sensors are calibrated with any lead or extension wires in place that will be used when installed in the rig. Once the sensor and its surroundings have reached a given set-point, data is recorded in the form of a running mean and standard deviation. The signal to noise ratio was found by dividing the running mean by the running standard deviation.

2.4.1

Resistance Temperature Detectors

The two resistance temperature detectors (RTOs) were calibrated on May 26, 2009. Each RTO has two sensing elements in the tip, so in effect four sensors were calibrated. The RTOs were calibrated on a Fluke Hart Scientific 9120S Orywell, Serial Number A74084, in the EPH343A Laboratory. Basic steps in obtaining the calibration data involved the following.

1) Set temperature of drywell and wait for steady state, approximately 7 min. 2) Run SIMULINK with data acquisition signals routed through the signal analysis block for approximately 2 min. 3) Stop SIMULINK and take readings. The RTOs were excited by 1 mA constant current as recommended previously (Keithley Instruments, Inc., 2007). The following data was recorded in Table 3 and Table 4 from the tests.

The data points 211.0Â°F and 31.0Â°F were collected to observe the signal difference between 1oF at the low and high end of the calibration range. These readings were not used in the following curve fits shown in Figure 25 through to Figure 28. The polynomial was used for increased accuracy even though there is a very linear response from the sensors.

The largest standard deviation from Table 3 and Table 4 is 0.0005470

measured on Channel11. For a normal distribution, 99.7% of data lies within three standard deviations to either side of the mean (Rees, 1989). The mean measured was 0.7589 V, and three standard

deviations are equal to 0.00165 V. Therefore, 99.7% of the data sampled was between 0. 75732 V and 0.7606V. Using the RTD11 polynomial, the mean value was found to be 211.1Â°F with a lower value of 209.4Â°F and an upper value of 212.rF. The difference between these values and the mean is -1.6Â°F and 1.6Â°F. Given that the drywell was only accurate to the nearest tenth of a degree Fahrenheit, the

uncertainty of a given reading is approximately Â±1.6Â°F.

After discussion of the results, it was decided to calibrate the sensor with 3 mA and 5 mA excitation to determine if self-heating becomes a factor. The increase of excitation current increases the voltage output of the sensor as well, but it was feared that self-heating would become a problem . On May 28, 2009, the calibration was performed again using the same Fluke Hart Scientific 9120S Drywell, Serial Number A74084, in the EPH343A Laboratory. The following tables, which are numbered Table 6

through Table 9, show the results for the different sensors at different excitations.

The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the clearest indicator of how the increase in excitation current improves the measurements. Additionally, the SmA excitation gives the lowest line losses when the total resistance is calculated using R = V /I, and this is shown below in Table 10 for the Channel 4 Sensor.

The actual resistance at 32Â°F is 500 0, so the line resistance at SmA is only 20 0, which is much less than the 77 0 cause by the lmA excitation current. The fifth degree polynomial coefficients are given in the table below for each sensor at 5 mA excitation in Table 11.

The maximum standard deviation for the 5 rnA excitation is 0.0005545 ~0.00055, which is similar to the standard deviation using 1 rnA excitation. However, the signal is much stronger and the mean value is equal to 212.0Â°F with the limits given by three standard deviations of 212.3Â°F and 211.rF or the overall uncertainty is Â±0.3Â°F. With the much smaller uncertainty, the 5 rnA excitation will be used for data acquisition on the test rig.

2.4.2

Thermocouples

Calibrating the thermocouples was slightly more complicated than the RTDs. A water bath was used to calibrate the thermocouples, using a calibrated RTD as the reference temperature. The calibration took place from June 25-26, 2009 using a Fisher Hotplate, Model 80 with Serial Number 102. First, an ice bath was made for the low temperature point. Next, the hotplate was used to heat the water to several temperatures, up to the boiling point. Finally, the bath was left to cool overnight so that the entire assembly would be at room temperature in the morning for the final reading. After the calibration was completed, all lead extensions and thermocouples were labeled with the corresponding channel. Serial numbers would have been used, but they are slightly obscured on the sensor.

The data collected is shown below from Table 12 through to Table 16 with the sensors labeled by channel number.

All of the RTD temperature measurements were rounded to the nearest full degree and then each thermocouple channel was calibrated in a similar manner to the RTDs but used a fourth degree polynomial. The irregular standard deviations and signal to noise ratios were due to the inconsistencies of the water bath as well as actual signal noise. The drywell used for calibrating the RTDs would have been used, but the thermocouple probes would not fit in the calibration ports. The polynomial

coefficients for all nine thermocouples are shown in the tables below from Table 17 through Table 19.

To determine the actual uncertainty of the thermocouple measurements is slightly more difficult since most of the measurements were not entirely at steady state. The exception to this was at 212Â°F where the reading was within the uncertainty for the RTD, and clearly had the greatest signal to noise ratio for any thermocouple calibration point. The highest standard deviation at 212Â°F may be found on channel 20 at approximately 0.0042V. For three standard deviations, the mean value is 212.0Â°F with an interval between 211.5V and 212.4V, or an uncertainty of approximately Â±0.5Â°F. However, considering the

additional uncertainty of the RTDs, which is Â±0.3Â°F, used to calibrate the thermocouples, a total uncertainty of at least Â±1 OF would not be unexpected.

The zero and span adjustments available on the conditioners were not used during this calibration. However, in the future, it may be desirable to thoroughly calibrate the conditioners, and use a drywell, if possible, for more accurate calibration points. Thermocouple calibrations are also heavily influenced by lead length, and therefore whenever a sensor is switched from one lead to another a new calibration should be performed.

2.4.3

Pressure Sensors

The pressure sensor calibration was performed on July 23, 2009. Essentially, all of the sensors were mounted on the same channel, and that channel was pressurized to a specified value, in general multiples of 20 psi. One sensor was used as exact and the Omega CA150 handheld calibrator was used to get as near to a multiple of 20 psi as possible. The basic procedure used is shown below: 55

1) Mount and wire all pressure sensors in a single channel. 2) Disconnect one sensor, and hook up to the CA150 Calibration Unit. 3) Charge channel to 20 psig. a. Slightly Over-Pressurize. b. Reduce Pressure to as close to 20 psig as the Calibration Unit can measure. i. For PX219 Sensors, 1 Vdc = 20 psig ii. For PX303 Sensors, 3 Vdc = 20 psig iii. For PX209 Sensors, 2 Vdc =20 psig 4) Reconnect sensor, and run acquisition system for one minute. 5) Disconnect the same sensor as before, and get final reading from the Calibration Unit 6) Repeat steps (2) to (5) up to 80 psig at 20 psi increments. The readings were averaged over a minute, and the PX303 data is given in Table 20 and Table 21. The PX303 sensor signal ranges from 1-11 Vdc, but the Nl PC6224 is limited to 10.5 Vdc. Therefore, though the sensors can safely operate at 100 psig, they cannot accurately transmit data at that range due to limitations of the data acquisition system. Since the rig is to be limited to 90 psig this should never be an issue.

The PX303 sensor signal ranges from 1-11 Vdc, but the Nl PC6224 is limited to 10.5 Vdc. Therefore, though the sensors can safely operate at 100 psig, they cannot accurately transmit data at that range

56

due to limitations of the data acquisition system. Since the rig is to be limited to 90 psig this should never be an issue. The following table, Table 22, shows the calibration data for the PX209 sensors.

Since the PX209 sensors have a 0-10 Vdc range, the readings at 100 psig were acceptable. However, the PX209 sensors are significantly noisier than the PX303. This trend is continued with the PX219 sensors, the data for which may be seen below in Table 23. Channels 8 and 10 were checked, but the sensors themselves seemed to be flawed, as they would not function with the calibration unit either.

The slight decrease is most likely due to slight leaks, signal noise, and minor temperature changes. Channel 1 was not calibrated and is the PX219 30 psia sensor used for measuring the ambient pressure in the room . A simple linear gain of three will be used with this sensor. For the other sensors, the following polynomial curve fits was used, found in Table 25 through to Table 27.

The largest standard deviation appears to be 0.013343. This would give a measurement uncertainty of Â±0.13 psi for the PX303 and PX209 sensors, and Â±0.27 psi for the PX219 sensors. However, considering that there was typically a loss of 0.10 psi during each 60 second test, the actual uncertainty at a given instant in time is probably less. The accuracy according to Omega, the manufacturer of the pressure

58

sensors, is 0.25% Full Scale. This would give an uncertainty of Â±0.25 psi for the PX303 and PX209 sensors and Â±0.50 psi for the PX219 sensors.

2.4.4

Flow Sensors

The thermal flow sensors were calibrated to give a similar output to the Omega FMA-905 series thermal flow sensor. However, this is not a true calibration as the actual state of the Omega sensor is unknown, but seems reasonable . A second Omega flow sensor will require some adjustment to function correctly since it seems to be prone to saturation.

The Omega flow sensor was mounted in the center outlet channel port with one thermal flow sensor mounted downstream. Flow was then passed through at a relative constant rate for 20 seconds, and the signals averaged. Since the Omega sensor does not cover the full range of the other sensors, the calibration curve was performed between roughly 250 SFPM to 2700 SFPM, which should cover the range of normal operation.

For flow rates less than 250 SFPM the thermal flow sensor should be turned off, since it is susceptible to thermal heating. The Omega flow sensors do not seem to have an issue with self heating due to

protection circuitry. To convert from SFPM to lb/s for a 2" Schedule 40 pipe, use the following relation. Essentially, this is done by multiplying the flow speed and density at standard conditions with the cross sectional area.

Normal operation is therefore 0.0073 lb/s up to 0.079 lb/s. The measurements are shown below for the Channel 2 flow sensor in Table 28.

Channel 1 was roughly calibrated earlier, but should be recalibrated at a later time. The third flow sensor was not immediately needed for the experiments. The sensor was curve fitted with a fourth order polynomial, for which the coefficients are shown below in Table 29.

The accuracy of the measurement for the FMA905 is 1.5% of the full scale. So for a sensor with a range up to 5000 SFPM, it is accurate to Â±75 SFPM. Since there is no manufacturer's data, and the

rudimentary flow scheme used, the measurements for the thermal sensor will be assumed to have the same uncertainty as the FMA-905.

2.4.5

Potentiometers

Only two of the actuators were calibrated at this time, and only three were operational at the time of this writing. The bottom channel had a functioning T and bleed channel valve, while the outflow valve was also operational. The top channel and the two ram air channels did not have any operational valves due to poor alignment in the case of the Tee valve, and poor mating adapter sizing for the other three valves. This section explains the method used to calibrate the bottom bleed channel valve and the outflow valve.

The first step was to set the closed position by commanding 4 mA and adjusting the zero setscrew position until the shaft visually appeared to be at 0Â°. The supply valve was then opened to listen for any leaks past the valve. The full open position was similarly set using a 20mA signal and adjusting the span setscrew until the shaft visually appeared at goo. The valve was then commanded back and forth

between the full open and full closed positions with pauses while the deadband was adjusted. Essentially the smallest dead band possible was used that did not permit jitter.

Since the command signal ranged from 4 mA to 20 mA for an angle of oo to goo, the following conversion was used to convert desired angle to the command signal.

(2.3)

To calibrate the potentiometer, the valve was commanded first to 0Â°, and a reading was taken over a period of time to collect a mean reading with a standard deviation. The valve was then opened by 10Â°, and the mean and standard deviation were taken again. The valve was then fully closed before being opened to 20Â° and more measurements were taken. This process was repeated to goo at which point readings started to be taken in the closing direction. For example, after the measurements for goo were taken, the valve was closed to 80Â° and readings were taken. After which, the valve was fully opened,

61

before being closed to 70Â°. The measurements taken for both the outflow and bottom bleed channel valves are shown in Table 30.

The small differences in voltage for the same commanded angle are due to the deadband and hysteresis. With a larger deadband, the differences are much greater, as was noticed on earlier

calibration attempts. An average of the opening and closing values was used to develop the polynomial to convert from the signal voltage to degrees and is shown in Table 31 ..

The uncertainty of the potentiometers is approximately Â±0.25Â°.

However, the minimum change in

command signal, or the deadband, that will move the actuators has a minimum setting of 0.12% of the full scale, which is roughlyÂ± 0.108Â°. The deadband has been increased slightly above this to eliminate the valve from oscillating rapidly, or jittering, about the set point, which can drastically reduce the lifespan of the motor and gearbox. The uncertainty of the potentiometers may be due to resistor tolerances, hysteresis, inaccuracies of the actuator control, or simply the dead band of the actuator.

2.5 Software
The core of the data acquisition and control software is the MATLAB SIMULINK Real-Time Windows Target Toolbox. This 32-bit virtual toolbox allows SIMULINK to interact with the sensors and actuators via the National Instruments boards installed in the computer. A relatively rudimentary control system has been put in place to aid in calibration and testing of the rig. This control system provides a basic modular structure of the software that can be easily updated or altered by future students. This basic system is composed of four subsystems and is shown in Figure 29:

Figure 29: SIMULINK Overall Control System

The acquisition subsystem is responsible for acquiring data from the sensors in the system and converting the measurements from voltage signals to engineering units via the calibration tables from Section 2.4. The engineering values are routed to a common data stream which may then be used for control, calculations, or display. Figure 30 shows the block assembly that retrieves data acquired by the PCI-6034E card.

The Analog Input block is from the Real-Time Windows Target, and controls both the sampling rate and the channels to be sampled. It outputs a multiplexed signal, which is then split before conversion to engineering units via polynomial or gain. Each data stream is then labeled by channel number and a letter prefix that denotes the sensor type and output as a bus with other common measurements.

The acquisition block also contains the Nl PCI-6224 Analog Input block and the conversion polynomials or gains for all of its channels. Both cards sample data at a rate of 1000 samples per second on each channel. No filtering or down sampling is performed in this subsystem at this time. Polynomial

conversions are typically used where the sensor has been calibrated as was mentioned previously. The gain conversions are used in sensors that have not yet been calibrated, specifically the ambient pressure

65

sensor and Omega Flow sensors. However, these sensors do have a manufacturer's calibration sheet, and their output seems reasonable.

The excitation block is the primary control of the rig. At the moment, it is comprised of discrete PID controllers for automatic control, and a slider gain for manual control. Selection between automatic and manual is done by a manual control switch. Currently, only the bottom bleed and outflow channels are operational. Work has been done on the top and bottom Tee valves. The other three valves are in place for future use. Figure 31 shows the current block arrangement, with the Real-Time Windows

Target Analog Output being used to interface SIMULINK with the Nl card, and thus the actuators.

The current setup shown would have the bleed air controlling downstream pressure to 20 psig, and the outflow controlled to 1000 SFPM . Both manual switches are selected to automatic control, but the valves would immediately begin to close if the switch were flipped over to manual. The bottom four constants are used to excite the RTDs with a 5 mA current. All of the data is multiplexed, before being passed through a saturation block that limits the output to 4-20 mA. As more controllers are added, it may be beneficial to place the individual controller and their supporting elements into a subsystem, but leave the switches and manual controls readily accessible.

Data is averaged over the previous ten samples before entering the PID Controller. The bottom bleed controller samples data every 1ms, and has an output limited between

oo and 90Â° with proportional gain

of 2.5 and an integral gain of 1. The outflow controller has a similar layout, but with a proportional gain of 0.003 and an integral gain of 0.001. These gains were tuned experimentally with feedback provided by a PX219 pressure sensor and a FMA905 flow sensor, and control performance will be shown later.

The Scope block essentially allows for the real-time display of data and is highly subject to change based on the test being performed and what variables need to be monitored. Essentially all data channels are connected here in a single bus, such that they can be displayed or recorded as necessary. For display

66

and recording purposes, data is typically sampled and recorded by the scopes at lOms. However, this may be increased or decreased as necessary. Currently, the program is setup to record a maximum 180s of data at a rate of 1000 samples per second for each desired channel. Considering the number of channels, this can result in a very large file, thus the down sampling.

The DATA scope is used to record and output all desired data as an array to the MATLAB workspace. This data may then be saved permanently using the xlswrite or csvwrite commands in MATLAB. These commands allow the data to be used by Microsoft Excel. The other four scopes serve as displays that show the current data as a moving plot, but do not record data.

The Calculations subsystem is intended to be the virtual sand box where any calculations or real-time data manipulation may be performed without interfering or confusing the core control blocks. The output of this block may be displayed, recorded, or used for control purposes as needed. This system has the potential to become very complex, so it is important to keep things organized as much as possible.

As mentioned previously, several samples of the control system in action will be shown here. Since the program records blocks of 180s worth of data, the first 180s are used for test initialization and stabilization, with the actual test being performed between 180s and 360s. For all tests, the supply pressure was regulated to 60 psig. The first test, the load pressure was to be maintained at 20 psig, while the outflow was varied from 1000 SFPM to 1500 SFPM and back down to 1000 SFPM. Figure 33 and Figure 34 show the results.

Flow response seems slow, approximately 50s to increase flow to 1500 SFPM and roughly 30s to decrease flow back to 1000 SFPM. However, this is necessary to avoid oscillations about the set point due to the large fluctuations in the flow measurement signal from the FMA905 flow sensor. Additionally, rapid changes in flow rate can result in large pressure losses, which may cause harmful response upstream as it tries to compensate. Therefore, though it is slow and may be improved, the flow control does work.

Pressure control seems much better, with the controller maintaining 20 psig Â±1 psi for the entire duration of the test. Relatively large changes with under damped response can be seen at times where the outflow valve has changed position to adjust for a new commanded outflow. The bottom bleed valve had to compensate for the corresponding pressure loss when the flow rate increased and pressure gain when the flow rate decreased. Considering the PX219 sensor used for control feedback has a Â±0.25 psi error, the system maintains 20 psig set point very well.

The second test involves maintaining 1000 SFPM while varying pressure from 20 psig up to 25 psig and back down to 20 psig. The plots of the tests are shown in Figure 35 and Figure 36. Pressure responds much faster with respect to changes in flow rate, especially during an increase in pressure. Reducing the pressure is limited to the outflow rate of air, which is why the slope is why the response appears to be linear until the controller responds to the overshoot. Overshoot peaks in both increase and decreasing at approximately 3 psi, with the response damping down to within a range of Â±1 psi within 40 seconds. Overall, the flow rate remains constant within Â±150 SFPM of the set point.

The third test involves changes in both the flow and pressure set points. Initially, flow and pressure are maintained at 1000 SFPM and 20 psig respectively. Next, both are increased to 1500 SFPM and 25 psig nearly simultaneously. Finally, the flow and pressure are decreased to their original values of 1000

SFPM and 20 psig respectively. Overall, from Figure 37 and Figure 38, the response seems very similar to the first and second tests, but it demonstrates that the control system is capable of handling both pressure and flow independently and simultaneously.

3 Theoretical Model
In order to develop a methodology for improving flow measurement using other sensors in a channel, a theoretical model needed to be developed based on the sensors and channel to be used for the experimental test. The primary purpose of improving flow measurement is one means of improving the master-slave flow sharing algorithm developed by Bao (Bao, 2003). This algorithm relies on the

measured flow of the master channel as the set-point for the mass flow for the slave channels. The slave channel control signal relies on the difference between the master and slave channel mass flow rates. Any form of sensor lag results in a slower response in the slave channel resulting in errors in flow sharing.

Several steps will be taken in the development of a theoretical model. First, the thermal flow sensor will be modeled since it is the chief sensor involved in the master-slave control scheme. Second, an orifice plate flow meter model will be developed to compare to the thermal flow sensor. When these models are completed, the errors relevant to each model will be explained and the estimation algorithm will be developed that takes advantage of the performance of each sensor. Third, a simple model of the

channel to be used will be developed, and this model will be used to mimic an orifice plate flow meter. Finally, the estimation algorithm will be modified to accept the channel model.

A line diagram of the bleed air channel is shown below in Figure 39. It shows the relevant locations of the sensors and valves to be used as well as the notation that will be used hereafter.

The portion of the line to be modeled falls between P2 and P3. The flow is assumed to be isothermal, and is assumed to be equal to the temperature found at T2. The heater, if present, is simply used as an additional resistance. For experiments C1 will be used for controlling the flow rate through the channel, and C2 will be used to vary the pressure drop in the channel. This essentially means that the pressure drop coefficient of Section 2 will be variable depending on the position of valve C2. The pressure drop coefficients across Sections 1 and 3 should be relatively constant. If the position of valve C2 remains constant, the problem essentially could be simplified as an equivalent orifice plate flow meter.

3.1 Thermal Flow Sensor Model
The thermal flow sensor was thoroughly studied at Ryerson University by Yiu in 2004 (Yiu, 2004). The model developed here is derived from previous work at the University with consideration to the work by Olin (Olin). Olin considers convection and conduction as relevant means of heat loss from the flow

74

sensors, whereas Yiu considered convection alone. However, Olin requires several empirical calibration values in his final result which does not make his method conducive to theoretical model. However, he does specify that in well designed sensors, conduction losses range between 10 and 15% of the power applied to the sensor, and that these losses are reduced as the flow speed increases.

Figure 40, which is shown below, is a simplified view of how a thermal flow sensor is mounted in a channel. The mass of air flowing past the sensor will directly affect the temperature of the heated sensor. More power will be added to the heated sensor until a set temperature difference is maintained between the ambient temperature sensor, which measures the actual flow temperature, and the heated temperature sensor. The power required to maintain the temperature difference can be directly

correlated to the mass flow rate, as the theory of this section demonstrates.

This is the same result used by Yiu.

The above equations all rely on the convective heat transfer coefficient, which is not readily available and is heavily reliant on the experimental conditions. However, there are methods of approximating the coefficient to roughly 20% accuracy. lncropera provides an equation relying only on the Reynold and Prandtl numbers of the flow being measured. Note that the flow is considered to be around a circular

77

cylinder in cross flow. The actual sensor has a complex shroud and is no way an ideal cylinder. The equation shown below provides the mean Nusselt number for the flow (lncropera & DeWitt, 2002).

This equation was developed by Churchill and Bernstein, according to lncropera, and may be used when

given flow condition, and the Nusselt number was set to zero. The Nusselt number may be converted to the convective heat transfer coefficient using:

To calculate the Nusselt number, Reynolds number with respect to the sensor diameter is needed. This is given by the following equation.

SIMULINK was used to model the sensor using a step mass flow input. Most of the physical values used were discussed by Yiu. The relevant values are reproduced below. The lengths are approximated since the sensor is proprietary. The sensor has a range up to 0.5 kg/s, and is mounted in a 2" Schedule 40 steel pipe which has an actual internal diameter of 2.07" (0.0526m). The following information about the mounting of the sensor incorporates data from lncropera at a temperature of 300 K. For the purpose of

78

this model, the airflow is assumed to be close to atmospheric pressure and at a constant temperature of 300 K. The heated sensor probe is assumed to be mounted on nylon insulator.

According to Yiu, the maximum flow rate is reported to be approximately 200 lb/min for a 3" diameter duct, which converts to a standard flow speed of approximately 54,200 SFPM. From the table above,

this approximation appears to be verified by the model. However, the model by Yiu reports a full signal of 5.4 W at 1.1 lb/s which is roughly 0.5 kg/s for a 2" diameter duct, but it is believed that the pipe diameter was used in calculations where sensor diameter should have been used. Interesting to note is the linear relationship between the maximum power of the sensor at 5.42 W and the maximum flow speed of 54,200 SFPM. Regardless, if the numbers are correct, the error of the model at maximum flow speed is only 6.4%, which considering the uncertainty of the Churchill-Bernstein equation is remarkably acceptable.

The losses due to conduction in the model are steady throughout, which makes sense considering the temperature difference is constant at steady state. However, the loss of 0.007 W is low, considering a well designed sensor is expected to have 10 to 15% heat loss due to conduction. A larger heat loss due

to conduction co~ld easily push the required power beyond 5.42 W. However, the low heat loss due to conduction is considered acceptable when compared to past assumptions regarding flow sensors. Also, losses due to conduction seem to only offset the required power for flow at steady state.

Additionally, due to the proprietary nature of the sensor, extremely detailed thermal analysis of the probe was avoided as can be seen by the approximate nature of the physical dimensions of the sensor. Other sources of error include neglect of conduction on the ambient flow sensor. Intuitively, if no flow is passing across the sensor, conduction then becomes the dominant form of heat transfer and since no insulation is completely ideal, the probe body will gradually heat up, thus resulting in the ambient sensor also heating up. This forms a positive feedback loop that will force the heated sensor to a higher temperature, thus raising the probe temperature further through conduction. This could potentially cause sensor burnout if the sensor is left on without flow for significant periods of time.

The calibration was performed on a sixth order polynomial, the coefficients and plots are shown below in Table 35 and Figure 41.

At steady state this model settles to within Â±10 SFPM of the actual mass flow experienced by the sensor. The exact dynamic response of the real flow sensor is unknown for a step input. However, other

sensors, such as the FMA-900 Series, typically have response times of roughly 0.4s to 63% of the final value, and according to Yiu, thermal flow sensors typically overshoot the steady state value by approximately 6% before damping down to the correct value. Using this information, the model was

manually tuned to give similar results. This resulted in a proportional gain of 0.4 with an integral gain of 1.4. The following figure shows a mass flow step at Ss from 0.002 kg/s to 0.500 kg/s.

From above, the maximum overshoot of approximately 8% occurs at O.Ss after the step change, which is acceptable for the purposes of this analysis.

3.2 Orifice Plate Flow Sensor Model
To develop the sensor fusion theory, a sharp edged orifice plate flow meter was used as another means of measuring the mass flow rate. In this case, the actual mass flow will be specified and the pressure

82

drop across the plate will be calculated. The calculated pressure drop will then be used as if it were an actual measured pressure drop, and the flow rate will be re-calculated. Figure 43 shows a basic orifice plate flow meter installation, with pressure taps located at 1 diameter upstream and 0.5 diameters downstream. Temperature of the flow is assumed to be either known or measured elsewhere.

Mass flow will be defined, and downstream pressure will be calculated iteratively. The steady state results are tabulated below in Table 37.

The orifice meter as a sensor requires three input signals, upstream pressure, downstream pressure, and temperature. Temperature is assumed to be constant, and pressure sensors respond very quickly to changes in flow. Therefore, orifice plate flow meters should respond much faster than the thermal type flow meter, but they are highly subject to calibration errors specifically with respect to the discharge and expansion coefficients.

Another source of error is the accuracy of the pressure sensors. For this model, the pressure sensors are assumed to be perfectly accurate. However in reality, all sensors have inherent errors. Compound

these inherent errors with calibration errors, and the orifice plate flow meter will most likely have much more uncertainty over the full flow range than the thermal flow sensor.

While the discharge coefficients and expansion coefficients were calculated via iteration during the calculation to solve for the downstream pressure, these values are generally approximated in actual

85

flow sensors.

In general, a single value is selected for the entire range.

In this case the discharge

coefficient will be set to 0.61. Since the expansion factor only requires the pressure ratio, which is assumed to be measured, it will be calculated for the actual measurement.

Since it was assumed that the dynamic response of the pressure sensors was instantaneous, the plot essentially shows a step change in the orifice plate flow. However, interesting comparisons can be

drawn from the dynamic response of the orifice plate flow meter when compared to the thermal flow meter measurements and the actual flow rate as shown below for the same step in Figure 42.

Figure 44: Dynamic Response of Thermal and Orifice Plate Flow Sensors

From this figure, the calibration error of the orifice plate flow meter is clearly observed, and it is approximately Â±2% of the actual flow measurement. Even with the assumption of ideal pressure

sensors, calibration errors still crop up due to assumptions of a constant discharge coefficient. The thermal flow meter tends towards the actual flow speed, but has a large overshoot and slow response

86

compared to the orifice plate flow meter. This leads into the primary research of this thesis, which is to improve flow measurement capabilities by fusing data from multiple sensors. Ideally, it would be

desirable to have the response of the orifice plate flow meter with the accuracy of the thermal flow sensor.

3.3 Sensor Fusion between Thermal and Orifice Plate Flow Meters
From Figure 44, it appears as though the thermal flow sensor reaches steady state about l.Ss after the initial step input. However, in fusing the signals it is not as easy as just switching between the 'more accurate' signals since the actual flow rate, and therefore the actual error, is unknown. Additionally, in the real world case, there are not only calculation errors with the orifice plate flow meter, but also measurement uncertainties from several sensors. Most methods of sensor fusion are based heavily on these measurement uncertainties.

The hybrid sensor is actually composed of the two flow sensors discussed above. Figure 45 shows that both the thermal flow sensor and the orifice plate flow meter are mounted in the same channel and experience the same mass flow of air. It is expected that the orifice plate flow meter will respond to changes in mass flow faster, but the thermal flow sensor will be more certain at steady state.

Figure 45: Diagram of Physical Hybrid Sensor

Multi-sensor multi-temporal data fusion is one method outlined by Mitchell. This method uses data from two or more sensors to form a common output based on measurement uncertainties. However, it

87

relies heavily on predictions from Kalman filters for correction and fusion weights (Mitchell, 2007}. A method similar to this was used by AI-Dhaher in conjunction with fuzzy logic. The results were good, but due to the mathematically intensive nature it was expressed in the paper that the method would not be feasible for use on a real-time system (AI-Dhaher, Farsi, & Mackesy, 2005}. Kong demonstrates a rather simple method of weighting, which may be applicable to this research. Essentially at each sampling time, the data from eight similar sensors is averaged and the value furthest from the mean is voted out. After which the remaining data is averaged between two groups, and the standard deviation is found. The following equation is then used to find the fused reading for a given sample time (Kong, Chen, Xie, & Zhou, 2005 ).

(3.15}

Day, from Ryerson, used the difference between the orifice plate calculation and the thermal flow sensor measurement to determine a correction factor (Day, 2005}. This does seem to improve the response, but it fails to account for measurement uncertainties, and is heavily biased towards the orifice plate results. This goes against most of the theory, which tends to favor the measurement with the lowest uncertainty, which for the vast majority of the time is the thermal flow sensor. However, during a sudden transient, the uncertainty of the thermal sensor temporarily increases dramatically until steady state is reached.

The method developed below uses assumed steady state uncertainties for the orifice plate and thermal flow sensors. If the mass flow undergoes a relatively large change in a short period of time, the mass flow sensed by the thermal flow sensor will lag behind the actual value. For changes in sensed mass flow larger than the standard deviation, the orifice plate flow meter measurement will be used. For

88

changes less than the standard deviation, the following equation which has been modified from Equation (3.15) will be used.

The steady state measurement uncertainties for the orifice plate and thermal flow sensor for the purposes of this model are assumed to be Â±500 SFPM and Â±50 SFPM respectively. This weighting

requires that at steady state the readings from both flow sensors are within the sum of the uncertainty of both sensors.

The difference between mass flows is used to determine whether to force the equation to equal the orifice plate calculation, or the weighted average based on the rate of change. This is used to remove a spikes caused by oscillations of the flow sensor. The spikes are caused when the sensed mass flow rate of change goes to zero, removing the weighting entirely. This method improves the initial response time, and only slightly increases the settling time to the final value. The results for a step from 0.002 kg/s to 0.5 kg/s are shown below in Figure 46.

Figure 46: Model Results for Hybrid Sensor, Step from 0.002 kg/s to 0.5 kg/s

These results show that the hybrid sensor output does not exceed the flow rate calculated by the thermal flow sensor. Also, after a rapid initial response from the orifice plate flow meter, it gradually decreases to the measured steady state value of the thermal flow sensor.

However, due to the very large uncertainty with respect to the orifice plate flow calculation a step from 0.5 kg/s to 0.002 kg/s does not give very satisfactory results as shown in Figure 47. The step results in all power being turned off from the heated sensor such that zero flow would be detected by the thermal flow sensor. The hybrid signal matches the erroneous thermal flow sensor due to the large uncertainty of the orifice flow meter measurement and the fact that the rate of change of the thermal flow sensor signal is equal to zero.

90

Possible remedies' involve refining the orifice plate uncertainty to be a variable depending on the calculated flow speed, or placing a minimum flow rate below which the data from the thermal flow sensor will be ignored . Additionally, calibrating the orifice plate using varying discharge coefficients could also reduce the uncertainty at smaller flow rates. These fixes will be considered in the next

section which involves pressure loss across a channel, rather than just an orifice.

3.4 Pressure Drop along a Channel
This section is intended to develop the hybrid sensor theory to utilize the pressure drop along the channel, rather than using the pressure drop across an orifice plate. However, the largest difficulty in

91

doing this is the pressure coefficient changes as the valves open or close. Therefore, a two part problem develops.

1) 2)

What affect does changing the valve opening area have upon the mass flow calculation using pressure drop? Will the hybrid flow sensor algorithm still hold true for different valve positions?

Most differential head meters, such as orifice plates, have similar problems, specifically poor accuracy and range (Upp & LaNasa, 2002L which was shown in the orifice plate flow meter model. The flow measurement accuracy varies due to the actual change of the discharge coefficient when compared to the constant flow measurement coefficient.

In order to model how the channel pressure drop which will be used as a secondary flow measurement, a simplified pressure drop model must be created that will give a downstream pressure for a given mass flow, upstream pressure, and temperature, similar to the calculation used for the orifice plate. Based on the pressure differential and upstream pressure, a calibration curve will be developed to calculate the loss coefficient, and thus measured mass flow. This will be calibrated to the thermal flow sensor, as it would be on the actual rig. Sensor assumptions from the orifice plate flow meter will be used here, specifically ideal sensors that response instantly and accurately.

From Figure 39, the pressure drop will be measured between P2 and P3 to calculate mass flow measurement. The modeled pressure loss coefficient is shown developed below based on theory from White (White, 2003) . Essentially, this may be simplified graphically as a group of flow resistors, similar to electrical or heat transfer theory, and is shown in Figure 48.

As the bypass valve opens, K vs will decrease, and K vH will increase, the values for which were estimated from Figure 6.18b of White. The smaller the valve opening area is, the larger the

corresponding pressure drop coefficient. The consideration of two goo elbows and two 45Â° elbows is an attempt to account for pressure drop resulting from the change in direction of the TandY fittings. Table 38 lists the assumed values used for this model, most of the values are from White, the heater coefficient was calculated from data about the heater. The heat exchanger coefficient is a guess.

To calculate the pressure drop, for a given mass flow the following equation was used. White does note that this is only a first approximation when considering compressible flow. For the actual rig, the

pressure drop values will be measured at steady state at several different operating points, but this will be further explained in the experimental section.

(3.23)

The calculation determines the actual pressure drop. Assuming ideal pressure sensors, this would be equal to the measured pressure drop. To effectively calculate a pressure loss coefficient based on

measured data, the mass flow and valve opening positions must be altered so that an average coefficient may be determined. This pressure loss data is shown in Table 39 and Table 40.

Pressure drop coefficients will be calculated based on the measured flow rate from the thermal flow sensor, pressure drop from upstream and downstream sensors, and temperature. Equation (3.23) is rearranged to calculate the measured pressure drop coefficient, K M.

The pressure drop coefficient is calculated for each flow rate as measured by the thermal flow sensor at steady state and then averaged for each opening angle and plotted against the bypass opening angle. Note that oo means the flow is entirely diverted through the heat exchanger, and at 90Â° the flow entirely

96

bypasses the heat exchanger. As can be seen in Figure 49, between 20Â° and 55Â° the valve effect is nearly linear. This roughly corresponds with the literature that claims butterfly valves throttle flow best A curve fit was applied so that the pressure drop

between 15Â° and 70Â° (Smith & Zappe, 2004).

coefficient could be easily inferred from the valve angle. For a good fit, the end points were excluded, such that the fit is between 10Â° and 80Â°. To compare the change in angle calculation of mass flow to the thermal flow sensor measurement, a constant mass flow rate of 0.5 kg/s was measured for lOs with the angle changing 10Â°/S over lOs from

oo to 90Â°.

On Figure 50,

oo occurs at Ss, with the angle increasing to

90Â° at lSs. The flow calculation seems to be most accurate between 6.5s and 12.5s or 15Â° and 65Â° bypass valve open area. From a control standpoint, it would be best to operate the bypass valve at a maximum range of 15Â° to 65Â° for best effectiveness.

For the bypass valve operating range of 15Â° to 65Â°, the error magnitude tends to scale with the actual mass flow rate. The percentage error was in the range of Â±0.3% of the signal. The key being is that using this method of flow calculation, the error is constant and repeatable, which should aid in the further development of the hybrid sensor.

Using a bypass angle of 30Â°, the flow was stepped 0.002 kg/s to 0.5 kg/s in Figure 51 by using the algorithm from the previous section. However, the error range has been corrected to what is seen by the newly developed flow calculation model. Additionally, the uncertainty of the thermal flow sensor is assumed to be around Â±2 SFPM. Of course, these are all theoretical signals and measurements,

experimental signals are expected to have much higher uncertainty and noise. However, as expected with more thoroughly expressed uncertainties, a lot of the problems seen using a simple orifice plate have worked themselves out. Most of the previous problems had to do with inconsistent or variable errors that did not follow a set pattern.

The empirical method used to calculate the pressure drop coefficient seems to allow for a more accurate, or at least more predictable, uncertainty for the pressure drop calculation. This allows for the reverse step, from 0.5 kg/s to 0.002 kg/s, to be feasible as shown in Figure 52.

Â· Â· Thermal Flow Sensor

In the above plot, the step occurs at Ss, and the thermal flow sensor reduces power dramatically such that it effectively detects zero flow. Around 6. 75s the heater on the thermal flow sensor turns back on, resulting in an overshoot and oscillation before damping out by 9.5s. The hybrid sensor effectively eliminates the large overshoots of the thermal flow sensor, but in this case the hybrid settles close to the pressure drop calculation due to the relative high degree of accuracy at low flow speeds. However,

100

this might create an issue in the experimental case due to the extremely small pressure drop and sensor noise.

The other concern is the effect of the valve moving on the hybrid sensor, and whether it will affect a steady state reading. From the figure below, it can be seen that the hybrid sensor works between 6 and 12.5s, corresponding to 10Â° and 65Â°, it fails outside of these limits due to the curve fit used, though for proper throttling, the valve should be operating in this range anyways. Essentially, at steady state mass flow, changes in the bypass angle, provided it is within the operating range, will not affect the calculated hybrid sensor output.

Experimental Work
However,

The experimental work of this thesis was limited due to construction delays and setup.

enough was performed to validate the hybrid flow sensor algorithm. The bottom bleed air and outflow channels were used for experiments. Pressure in the load tank was controlled using the bottom bleed valve, and flow out of the tank was controlled using the outflow valve.

Setup for the experiments involved closing off the exits of the right hand tank, while leaving the crossflow valve open for a larger volume of supply air. For the left hand tank, the inlet and bottom bleed channel manual valves are fully opened with the actuators supplying all control.

Sensors are located in the bottom bleed channel at the positions shown in Figure 54 . However, before the hybrid flow sensor testing could be accomplished, the pressure drop across the rig needed to be measured to determine if it could be used to calculate flow rate. flow calculation section. This process was attempted in the

4.1 Flow Rate Calculation
For the flow rate calculation, data was taken from all sensors at several different flow rates and Tank 3 pressures to determine if the pressure drop can be measured across a channel of the rig. Flow rates were varied between 1000 SFPM up to 3000 SFPM for brief periods, but no appreciable pressure drop could be measured between sensors PB2-05 and P0-02 which forms the pressure drop value similar to that used in the theoretical section for the flow calculation. A fifteen second sample of the test is shown in Figure 55. The flow rate during this time was approximately 1500 SFPM with a Tank 2 pressure of 50 psig and the flow fully diverted through the heat exchanger.

It is difficult to distinguish between the two signals, but the downstream bleed, measured just after the bleed channel valve at PB2-05, seems to be slightly higher on average than the P0-02 or the load pressure measurement on average. However, the difference between both signals is clearly within the operating error of the sensors. The difference between these two sensors is much too small to be used for a flow approximation .

Referring back to Table 39, for a bypass opening angle of oo with a flow speed of roughly 1500 SFPM, the pressure drop was calculated to be 3644 Pa, or 0.5285 psi, including the heater. The heat exchanger does not seem to be a very significant contributor of pressure drop as was assumed in the theoretical calculation. It is understandable that the pressure drop is difficult to measure when considering the uncertainty of the sensors, absent heater, and low pressure drop from the heat exchanger. It may be

possible to achieve a measureable pressure drop with the heater installed and a very large flow rate, in the range of 3500 to 4200 SFPM. This range is roughly 80 to 100 SCFM, which is the upper operating limit of the heater.

However, noticeable pressure drops do occur across the control valves located at 82-04 and 0-03. This is an obvious and relatively straight forward means of obtaining a pressure drop for a flow calculation. A similar process may be used as discussed in Section 3.4. Essentially, the upstream and downstream static pressures will be measured, along with flow and valve opening angle. A pressure drop coefficient will be determined from this information and related to the opening angle. This will be performed on both the bleed channel control valve and the outflow valve, so that the hybrid sensor algorithm might be compared to two different flow sensors.

After several days of testing, no repeatable pressure drop coefficient related to the opening angle of the valve could be found. Any values that were found seemed to be accurate for only a very small range, and even then only on certain occasions. Most likely this is due to the very small opening angles at

105

which the rig operates. The rubber valve seal interacts with the edge of the valve disc in a random manner at small opening angles.

An easily reproducible pressure drop coefficient was found across the exhaust restriction. It was setup with a PX219 sensor and calibrated to the FMA905 flow sensor. Since it is so close to the exhaust, the density was assumed constant at 1.2041 kg/m 3 which is the standard density at 20Â°C and standard pressure of 101325 Pa. The pressure drop coefficient was calculated at approximately 2646 Â± 100. Figure 56 is an image of the SIMULINK code used to calculate the pressure drop coefficient.

Figure 56: SIMULINK Pressure Drop Calculation

The pressure and flow data, P7 and OS respectively, were converted to metric units in real-time. The pressure drop coefficient was then calculated and averaged over a steady state flow rate of 1000 SFPM. P7 refers to the pressure sensor located at P0-08, which is just upstream the final exhaust restriction. Since it is a gauge pressure sensor, it effectively measures the pressure difference between the outlet and inlet of the flow restriction.

Using the pressure drop coefficient that was calculated in the steps above, the flow rate was estimated in real time and compared to the flow rate measured by the Omega flow sensor. Another test was performed to determine the response of the restriction flow estimation. For this test, the load tank pressure was maintained at 20 psig. The outflow valve was manually commanded for the test, with the

106

valve being commanded open and closed to achieve as fast of a response as possible. command and actual valve response are shown in Figure 57.

At small opening angles, less than 10Â°, there is a slight offset error, but above 15Â° the commanded angle and the actual angle are very close to being equal. This resulting step pattern affected flow rates as shown in Figure 58. Here the necessity of the hybrid flow sensor is not apparent. Flow response is almost instantaneous from the Omega flow sensors, and from Figure 59 it can be seen that the flow sensor signal lags roughly 0.5s behind the pressure calculation. This is very close to the 400ms quoted by the manufacturer for the Omega flow sensor response time.

Other observations gleaned from the step response plot are the large overshoot of the fast responding flow sensor, and the offset error of the restriction flow calculation. Both of these errors were predicted in the theoretical section. However, the flow signal is not as steady as expected. The fluctuating flow 107

signal and quick response does not lend the Omega sensor to the hybrid algorithm. Therefore, the Omega sensor was switched with the thermal flow sensor, for which the theoretical work was based. Essentially, the experiment is following the same process as Section 3.3, but with a simplified head loss flow calculation.

Another interesting observation may be gleaned by comparing Figure 57 to Figure 58. Even though the valve returns to the same position of roughly go each time, the flow never returns to the same rate. This is the reason that the correlation between the valve opening angle and pressure drop coefficient across the valve was unreliable.

Figure 59: Omega Flow Sensor Step Response

After the flow sensors were switched, another control system test was performed to ensure proper response. Pressure was again maintained at 20 psig while the flow was stepped from 1000 SFPM to 1500 SFPM and then back down to 1000 SFPM. The results are shown in Figure 60, and the differences between the two thermal flow sensors are immediately apparent. The Omega flow sensor response is rapid, but the signal fluctuates heavily at steady state. Conversely, the thermal flow sensor has a very slow response, but seems to be very smooth.

Again, the valve was manually commanded opened and closed for fast response. The commanded and actual valve positions are shown in Figure 61, and the flow sensor response compared to flow calculation is shown in Figure 62.

Therefore, the thermal flow sensor could greatly benefit from the hybrid algorithm. This algorithm is intended to use the redundant sensors to get the fast response of the head loss flow calculation but retain the accurate steady state performance of the thermal flow sensor.

4.2 Hybrid Sensor Algorithm Validation
The hybrid algorithm developed in Section 3.3, was further simplified to only include the weighting function. Furthermore, heavy filtering and down sampling was required to allow the discrete derivative of the signal to be found. Thus Equation (3.16) is simplified to Equation (4.1) since it was found that the hybrid would still operate satisfactorily without the switch at high mass flow differences.

At this point, the four weightings and flow signals are used in Equation (4.1) . sampled to create a smoother curve. The output is again down sampled, averaged, and then up

Figure 65: Hybrid Algorithm Flow Response Test

For each of the steps, the head loss calculation response typically gives the fastest response and noisiest signal. The hybrid algorithm is always between the head loss calculation and flow measurement. Finally the flow measurement is the smoothest and slowest responding signal of the three. For each of the three increasing steps, there is a noticeable dip followed by a gradual rise of the pressure and hybrid signals. The dip is due to the rapid pressure loss of opening the valve rapidly, and the gradual rise is due to the upstream bleed valve compensating by increasing the flow to the load tank to bring the pressure back to the set point. The opposite occurs on the decreasing steps, which is why there is a gradual decrease in flow rate after the initial rapid decrease as the excess pressure bleeds off from the load tank and steady state is reached again.

Figure 66 clearly shows the final decreasing step of the test. Between 290s and 298, the hybrid sensor is following the slight overshoot as the thermal flow sensor settles to steady state. At 299s, the valve

114

begins closing, and both the pressure drop flow calculation and the hybrid sensor drop to within 200 SFPM of the final value within a second, easily matching the rotational speed of the valve.

Figure 66: Hybrid Flow Sensor Step Response

Beginning around 312s, the thermal flow signal begins a slight overshoot, and the decreased rate of change causes the hybrid sensor to begin following the thermal flow signal more closely. Between 31Ss and 326s the three signals are nearly exactly overlapping. However by 33Ss, the signals have reached steady state. At this point, the pressure sensor is reading lower than the thermal flow sensor.

The hybrid equation and its application are relatively simple, and the only real means of improving the response is to fine tune the gains, signal filtering, and sample rates further. Assuming that the response of the thermal flow sensor cannot be improved by other means, the only place to improve is to get a

115

more detailed flow calibration to reduce the steady state uncertainty. Due to the rudimentary means of the pressure drop flow calculation, it leaves room for the largest improvement in steady state accuracy. This may be accomplished by including the actual upstream density, expansion, and discharge coefficients. However, considering that the restriction consists of a reducing elbow and a bushing, the discharge coefficient may be difficult to determine, but assuming that the other variables may be calculated, the discharge coefficient could be determined via calibration at steady state to a more accurate flow sensor.

In comparing the fast responding Omega flow sensor to the thermal flow sensor, it becomes apparent that simply increasing the response of the thermal flow sensor can only be accomplished with a loss of steady state accuracy. The very fast responding pressure sensors will still suffer from relatively noisy signals at steady state regardless of the thoroughness of the calibration. Filtering the data may provide some relief. However, calculating flow off pressure drop is still susceptible to offset errors when

operating at flow rates far away from the calibrated range. Ultimately, even if the two sensors respond ideally and instantaneously, the hybrid algorithm simply provides a way to average the output of two redundant sensors which is not a hindrance at all.

4.3 Flow Control using the Hybrid Algorithm
To determine if any improvement in flow control could be determined, all three flow sensors were used as the feedback signal for the controller. Gains were changed slightly in each case to reduce oscillations. The same command signal was used in each case so that the different responses could be compared to each other. The first run used the thermal flow sensor as the feedback signal, the second run used the pressure drop flow calculation as the feedback signal, and the third run used the hybrid sensor for feedback. Figure 67, Figure 68, and Figure 69 show each of the individual sensor responses compared to the different runs. Figure 67 shows that the hybrid sensor responds ever so slightly faster than the

thermal flow sensor, and with a smaller overshoot. However, there is a steady state offset error, but not nearly as bad as that of Run 2, which is the case using the feedback signal of the pressure drop flow calculation.

The slow response of Run 2 had to do with the decreased gain values that had to be used to reduce the oscillations of the control signal. Even then, some of the oscillations are apparent on Figure 68 between 210s and 230s.

Figure 69 shows the hybrid sensor response, and for Run 3, the faster response and smaller overshoot can be clearly seen. Additionally, the hybrid signal generally lies within Â±75 SFPM uncertainty of the thermal flow sensor at steady state.

The decrease in overshoot is most obvious on the decreasing steps.

When using the thermal flow

sensor for control, large overshoots of up to 200 SFPM occur. However, this is prevented using the hybrid flow sensor, and is shown clearly in Figure 70. As well, the faster response of the hybrid sensor controlled system is visible, and is approximately 1s faster over the normal thermal flow sensor controlled system.

Figure 71 shows the thermal, pressure, and hybrid flow sensor responses during Run 3, which is when the hybrid flow sensor provides control feedback. Once again, the faster response of the hybrid signal is apparent, along with a slight offset error.

5 Conclusion and Future Research
This section is intended to summarize the work done on the test rig, results of the experiments performed, and outline possible future work and research .

5.1 Conclusion
The test rig has been built and can be used in its current form for tests. However, the heaters still need to be installed, as well as the pressure safety valves and several actuators. Overall, the SIMULINK control system interfaces smoothly with the instrumentation. However, for simultaneous temperature and flow control two more Omega flow sensors will need to be purchased.

Not all of the theory laid out in this thesis could be validated by experimentation. The pressure drop across the channel was too small to be measured accurately for a flow calculation . The pressure drop across a partially opened valve, though measurable, was not repeatable. This was most likely due to hysteresis and random interaction between the seal and disc.

However, using two different redundant means of flow calculation to improve the overall flow measurement was shown to be possible. By measuring the pressure drop across a flow restriction, flow can be repeatable calculated, and then compared with the measurement of the thermal flow sensor. Generally, when the flow rate changes it is due to either a gradual pressure change or a faster valve position change. The thermal flow sensor can accurately measure slight changes, but it lags heavily on detecting the large flow changes caused by the valve. Alternatively, the pressure drop flow calculation responds immediately to large flow changes, but oscillates heavily at steady state, making minor changes in flow rate difficult to detect.

Since the overshoot of the thermal flow sensor is not as large as expected in the theoretical section, only the weighted average needed to be used. The error switching portion of the theory was not necessary.

121

The weighted average assumes that the pressure drop flow calculation will have a single large step whenever a valve is moved, whereas the thermal flow sensor will detect a gradual rise. By

differentiating the signals, the pressure drop flow calculation will have a very large spike initially, and then drop immediately back down to zero. On the other hand, the thermal flow sensor will not have any spikes in the differential, but instead have a sustained non-zero derivative during transients. Since the flow rate change is closer to a step change, one would expect the actual flow rate to be similar to that detected by the pressure drop flow calculation. Therefore the weighted average was developed to use the sustained, non-zero derivative to form a weighted average.

In theory, this was easy to be seen since the signals are smooth. In practice, the signals needed to be heavily filtered and down sampled so that the derivative could be roughly determined. Once the

derivative was found, a gain was applied such that it could change the bias of the average based on measured changes of the individual flow measurements. When the thermal flow sensor has a large rate of change, the weighted average will bias towards the pressure measurement, but when the thermal flow sensor has a small or zero rate of change, like at steady state, then the weighted average will be biased towards the thermal flow measurement.

Nevertheless, experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the hybrid sensor. Not only did the algorithm capture the benefits of each of the redundant flow measurements, but also demonstrated the ability to improve control response when used as a feedback signal. Although the pressure drop flow calculation responds faster, it does not provide a very smooth signal, which results in choppy and fluctuating control signals. These may cause unnecessary wear on the actuator over time, and the gains were reduced to minimize the oscillations. On the other hand, the slow thermal flow sensor response causes unnecessarily large overshoots. The hybrid sensor allowed corrections to both of these problems. By

122

providing a smooth steady state signal, unnecessary wear can be avoided, and at the same time having a fast response minimizes the overshoot.

5.2 Future Research
The construction of the new test rig and improvement in hardware has opened up many possible research areas. The new rig returns flow sharing capabilities back to the lab, without the loss of the recently developed temperature control capability. Having two temperature control channels in a flow sharing arrangement naturally leads to the possibility of combining the two research streams, such that flow sharing and temperature are controlled simultaneously. The load tank provides the new possibility of independent outlet pressure control by changing the outflow exit. On previous flow sharing tests, the outflow valve was essentially set and fixed in place, so the downstream pressure was directly controlled by the upstream pressure and flow rate.

Beyond flow sharing and temperature control, which were developed in the past, the new rig also opens up the possibilities of testing fault tolerance in temperature control systems. One such scheme could involve maintaining the temperature and pressure in the load tank if one channel 'failed' in some way. Essentially, the working channel would be forced to make up the difference of the faulty channel.

Valve hysteresis is another area where research could be expanded. All of the actuated valves have been equipped with potentiometers, which should allow for more in-depth research of electric valve performance in air flows, especially in conjunction with sensor ports mounted upstream and downstream of each valve.

Accurate thermodynamic modeling of the entire test rig could also prove to be a challenging research topic. Initially, it was desired to build a SIMULINK model that could be used as a virtual sandbox to

simulate the rig such that future changes to the control systems could be tested safely in advance. This was attempted, but too many assumptions significantly reduced confidence in the results.

123

Sensor fusion could be developed much more effectively as more accurate models of the system are developed. The simple hybrid algorithm in this thesis is essentially just a weighted average between two redundant flow sensors. Actual sensor fusion across the entire system requires a way to predict what each sensor should be measuring based on the signal of another sensor and vice versa. This may require analytical redundancy in the system which would require an accurate model.

As eluded to earlier, fault detection, identification, and accommodation could be another possible research topic. Two similar channels would allow for a simulated fault in one channel, while the other channel can accommodate, if required, after detection and identification of the fault. Sensor fusion and analytical redundancy could also play a role in detecting faults, especially soft sensor faults. The hybrid sensor also lends itself to fault tolerance by incorporating fault detection into the weighting function.

Heat exchanger analysis will also be easier to perform on this test rig due to the sensor ports at each inlet and exit. Other flow sensor tests and developmental work could also be performed on the new rig.

A basic framework for future research of the rig may be the design and model of a control system for the simultaneous control of flow, temperature, and pressure of the load tank. After the model, or simulation, is validated with experimental results, the model may be used to form an analytically redundant system in conjunction with sensor fusion. From this research, the fault detection, Beyond this,

identification, and accommodation algorithms can most likely be readily developed.

research could look into prognostics or fault prediction or new control schemes. Specific component research, such has valve hysteresis studies and heat exchanger or sensor analysis, could be integrated into the existing models to improve accuracy over previous models.
