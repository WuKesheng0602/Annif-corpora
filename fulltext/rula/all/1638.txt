CHEMICAL PRETREATMENT AND ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS OF MIXED            SOURCESEPARATED ORGANIC (SSO) AND WOOD WASTE 
 
Michael Faye, Master of Applied Science, 2010  Civil Engineering, Ryerson University

ABSTRACT 
This paper examines the effectiveness of two pretreatments on SourceSeparated Organic waste (SSO)  mixed with wood wastes:  long term lime for SSO mixed with forestry waste (hardwoods), and the  cellulose solventorganic solvent lignocellulose fractionation (COSLIF) method, with SSO and demolition  waste (softwoods).  For long term lime treatment, the highest overall conversions from cellulose to  glucose and xylose were 50.4 %, and 43.5 % respectively.   The best temperature found for long term  lime pretreatment was 65 °C.  The COSLIF pretreatment glucose yield was found to be 93.7 %.  The  highest enzyme hydrolysis yield found was 93.5 % for a cellulase loading of 30 FPU/ g glucan at 50 °C.   The best hydrolysis yield found at lower loading (10 FPU / g glucan), was 83.5 %.   At 40 and 50 °C, all  peak hydrolysis yields were achieved between 12 and 24 hours.   A drop in temperature below 40 °C  caused a slowing of the hydrolysis rate.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The price of oil has increased over the last decade from $23.17 per barrel in January 2000 up to a peak  of $137.11 per barrel in July of 2008 (US Energy Information Administration).  Prices at the pump  reached as high as $ 4.10 per gallon (Kumar et al., 2009).  During the same period, a better  understanding of how the consumption of fossil fuels was affecting our climate pushed the public  toward a desire for "cleaner" energy.  As the price of oil raced higher and this desire for cleaner energy  began to take hold, demand for biofuels (fuels from renewable resources) was greatly enhanced.   Governments in North America and Europe began implementing gasoline substitution targets in order to  encourage biofuel production, to satisfy both fuel security and environmental concerns.  Since the  conversion of food plants, which contain easily accessed sugars and oils, are more easily processed to  fuel than plants containing sugar in the form of cellulose, the major share of biofuel production has  been from food crops; corn for the ethanol program in North America ,and rapeseed oil for Biodiesel in  Europe.   The logic of using crop land for biofuel production in light of worldwide rising food prices has  sparked what is known as the, "food versus fuel" debate.   The arguments against using food for fuel will  be outlined in Section 3.1 (Literature Review).   This paper, and the associated project, offer an  alternative to using food crops.  The project hopes to show that ethanol can be made from more socially  and environmentally acceptable sources, and possibly at greater profit margins.      

Lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol fermentation is both environmentally friendly, and socially  acceptable, because it does not compete with food for land use.  The four main categories that  lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol use fall under are:  agricultural residue (e.g. corn stover), dedicated  energy crops (e.g. switchgrass), forestry residue (e.g. sawmill residue or tree clipping), and municipal  waste (paper or organic).   Lignocellulosic biomass is plant matter, or material made from plant matter,  that contains lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose.    The cellulose has to be broken down to glucose, and 

1 

the hemicellulose broken down to xylose and other sugars, which can be fermented by the same  microorganisms that ferment ethanol in the corn ethanol process.   In this paper, SourceSeparated  Organic Waste (SSO) was mixed with demolition and forestry waste, and broken down to sugars for  ethanol fermentation.  The two main differences for fermenting ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass as  opposed to food crops (corn or sugar cane) are:   1) the lignin shield that protects the sugar components  in the plant wall needs to be opened, and 2) the bonds of the long chains of cellulose and hemicellulose  sugars need to be removed.   The change in the lignin shield is brought about by chemical pretreatment,  and the bonds of the sugar chains are removed by enzymatic hydrolysis.   

 

1.1 Chemical pretreatment 
The first step of pretreatment generally involves a mechanical reduction in size of the material to be  fermented.  This could be accomplished by milling, grinding, or in the case of this project, screw  pressing.  In most cases, the biomass is then further broken open by chemical pretreatment, to break  the bonds of the lignin shield.   A number of pretreatment options are available, the most prominent  being dilute acid, hot water, ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX), ammonia recycle percolation (ARP), and  lime (Mosier et al., 2005)  This paper will explore the efficiency of two kinds of pretreatment:  long term  lime treatment, and the cellulosesolvent organicsolvent based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF)  method.

1.1.1

Long term lime treatment 

The lime option holds a number of advantages for the breakdown of mixed SSO and forestry waste.   Lime has been assessed in a cost comparison study by Eggman and Elander (2005) to be less expensive  than both hot water and ARP.  The high lignin content of the wood portion of the waste possibly rules  out AFEX technology, because it is not efficient for biomass with high lignin content (Kumar et al., 2009).   Most importantly, at pilot plant scale, it could be more promising than dilute acid pretreatment, which is  to date the cheapest (Eggman and Elander, 2005), and most comprehensively modeled form of  pretreatment (NREL, 2002).  The reason it could be more promising is that at pilot scale, the increased  costs due to lost economies of scale, wouldn't affect lime pretreatment as much as dilute acid.  The pre treatment reactor costs are significantly lower for lime than dilute acid (Eggman and Elander, 2005),  therefore the increase in relative fixed costs for the scaled down pilot plant would be greater for dilute  acid.  Fixed costs for lime are much lower because the treatment can be applied at ambient pressure  and modest temperature over a long period of time, which requires no special steel treatment vessel  (Kim, 2005; Ramirez, 2005).   A full scale plant could also benefit from long term lime treatment as the  capital saved from smaller fixed costs for pretreatment could be reinvested in a larger facility.  The  increased variable costs would be offset by the negative feedstock costs associated with using SSO.   

The objective of the lime treatment portion of the paper will be to judge the effectiveness of lime  treatment as on option for mixed SSO and forestry waste.  Treatment effectiveness will be judged by the  proportion of glucose and xylose contained in the biomass that is released by enzymatic hydrolysis.

1.1.2

COSLIF method 

Using the cellulose solventorganic solvent based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF) method holds a  number of advantages for the SSO mixed with demolition waste.  The COSLIF method has already been  proved effective with corn stover, switchgrass, poplar wood, and douglas fir (Zhang et al., 2007).  Those  feedstocks would be similar in composition to the components in the SSO/demolition waste.  The  demolition wood waste used for this study is mainly made up of softwood, particularly douglas fir.  The  COSLIF method itself has a number of advantages over other pretreatment options:  Modest reaction  conditions (50°C, atmospheric pressure), low sugar degradation, no inhibitor formation or special  reactor needed as in dilute acid treatment, extremely high enzyme digestibility, extremely fast  hydrolysis rates, and easy recovery of acid with separation between solid sugars and liquid acid (Zhang  et al., 2007).  If a demolition wood waste mix was successfully digested by the COSLIF method, it would  indicate an extremely high likelihood of success in digesting almost any other mix of biomass with SSO.  (The demolition wood is mainly composed of softwood.  Softwood has very high lignin content in  comparison to other biomass.) 

The objective of the COSLIF portion of the paper will be to assess the effectiveness of the COSLIF  method to pretreat SSO mixed with demolition waste under a number of different enzyme hydrolysis  conditions.  Different enzyme loading conditions will be tested to find the optimal loading for  fermentation profit maximization.  Varying enzyme hydrolysis temperature conditions will also be tested  to find the ideal temperature for fermentation.  Effectiveness of the pretreatment at the different  conditions will be assessed by the amount of glucose released by enzymatic hydrolysis in relation to the  total glucose available in the untreated biomass.

1.2 Enzymatic hydrolysis 
Enzymes are added after chemical pretreatment to convert the long chain polymeric sugars of cellulose  and hemicellulose, into monomeric sugars like glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose and arabinose.  The  effectiveness of the chemical pretreatment is judged by the effectiveness of the enzymatic hydrolysis.  If  the proportion of glucose or xylose released by enzymatic hydrolysis is high in comparison to the total  glucose or xylose available in the biomass, then the pretreatment is deemed effective.  The proportion  of glucose or xylose released is judged to be high, if it compares favorably to the proportion of glucose  or xylose released by enzyme hydrolysis in other pretreatment studies of similar biomass, at similar  enzyme loadings.  The release of the other sugars found in hemicellulose such as galactose, arabinose,  and mannose, are often ignored because bacteria typically used to ferment the enzyme hydrolysis liquor  are not capable of fermenting those sugars at this time.  The most common system today is the  breakdown of cellulose with enzymes from the fungi Trichoderma reesei, followed by a fermentation  using the saccharolytic bacteria Sacchomyces cerevisea (baker's yeast).   Since baker's yeast only  ferments glucose, some studies only include glucose conversions. 

To assess the effectiveness of enzyme sugar conversion in comparison to other studies, a common  dosage/loading of cellulase must be administered.   A common language for dosage/loading was  developed by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) from the cellulase studies  of Ghose (1987) and Miller (1959).   Dosage is reported by the addition of activity units per gram glucan,  glucose, or dry biomass.   The activity units are called Filter Paper Units (FPU) because the procedure to  find the activity level of cellulase used for the experiment, involves solving for the concentration of  cellulase that will convert 4 % of a 50 mg strip of Whatman filter paper to 2.0 mg of glucose in 1 hour.   The most common loadings tested are 15 and 60 FPU per gram glucan.  Glucan is the amount of glucose  stored in the cellulose and hemicellulose components of biomass.

1.3 Project objectives 
The overall project, of which this thesis is a part, seeks to use Source Separated Organic Waste (SSO)  from Toronto's Green Bin Program, as a fuel source for ethanol fermentation.  The motivation behind  the research is twofold:   · Successful completion would provide an avenue to rescue Toronto's ailing green bin waste  diversion strategy, as well as encourage other cities to divert organics away from landfill.  ·  SSO could be an environmentally friendly, costeffective fuel source for an ethanol plant.  It  would be a renewable, cellulosic source, that doesn't compete with the food supply for land  use, or have the negative environmental impacts associated with fuel from food.  SSO as a  feedstock, could also be capable of producing ethanol at less cost than fuel from food  alternatives, because of the negative price gained from tipping fees that governments will be  willing to pay to divert it from landfill.  

1.4 Project stages 
The project can be broken into five stages.  This study forms a part of the Stage 2.     Stage 1:  Characterization of mixed SSO and wood waste as a biomass feedstock in order to examine       the potential of utilizing SSO for ethanol production.    Stage 2:   Investigation of appropriate chemical and lowest cost biological pretreatments to best   break down the mixed SSO/wood feedstock to its component sugars for ethanol           fermentation.    Stage 3:   Investigation of the feasibility of converting pretreated SSO to ethanol in two stages of   enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation utilizing the cellulase enzyme and the bacterium     Zymomonas mobilis.    Stage 4:   Production of ethanol and acetate in a continuousculture fermentor.    Stage 5:   Design and operation of a benchscale ethanol plant.

2 STUDY SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES 
The major focus of this study was to prove that Source Separated Organic Waste (SSO), mixed with  wood waste, is capable of being broken down to component sugars.   The study aimed at contributing to  proving that the sugars in SSO and mixed waste could be a more profitable feedstock source than corn  for ethanol.  The scope of this paper was to address the effectiveness of two different pretreatments, in  preparing a mix of Source Separated Organic (SSO) and wood wastes, for enzymatic hydrolysis.   The first  is a long term lime pretreatment.  The conditions of long term lime treatment were:   the addition of  lime at ambient pressure, moderate (55, 65 and 75 °C) temperatures, oxidative conditions (supply of  compressed air), and a relatively long (6 weeks) period of time.  The conditions were modeled after the  successful long term lime studies of Kim (2005) and Ramirez (2005), with a slightly higher temperature  range, and longer duration.  Within the lime treatment portion of the paper, the following results were  arrived at:   ·

Effectiveness of long term lime to prepare SSO mixed with hardwood for enzymatic  saccharification.   The assessment of effectiveness was reported in terms of overall yield  (glucose solubilized from initial cellulose composition), and compared to similar studies.

The ideal temperature and timing of the best overall yield. 

 The second pretreatment covered in this paper is the COSLIF method.  The COSLIF method is comprised  of a phosphoric acid hydrolysis, an organic solvent wash, and a water rinse.    The ideal timing of the  phosphoric hydrolysis portion, composition of the organic solvents, estimated overall yield at high  enzyme loading (60 FPU cellulase / g glucan), and best cellulase cocktail (Accellerase 1500), was  previously found by Ehsanipour (2010).  The goal of this study was to find a more precise answer for the  overall glucose yield, to present the hydrolysis profile of the waste digestion, and estimate the best  enzyme conditions for cost effective fermentation.   The Ehsanipour (2010) study was extended, by  7

Enzyme loading with the Accellerase 1500 cellulase experimented with at a temperature of 50 °C and a  pH of 5.0, to determine what loading would return the most profit.   The effectiveness of the enzyme  hydrolysis was also assessed with a drop in temperature to 40, 35, and 30 °C.  The results of the  temperature range hydrolysis were used to find the best temperature for future fermentation pairing  with the rapidly sacchorolytic bacteria Zymomonas Mobilis.  The following points summarize the findings  that this study accomplished:  ·

The effect of enzyme loading, through hydrolysis profiles of glucose released versus time, for  loadings of 10, 15, 30, and 60 FPU / g glucan. 

·

The calculation of best loading in terms of profit. (Profit assessed by ethanol revenue in terms of  sugar yield at that loading versus cost of cellulase at that loading)

3 LITERATURE REVIEW 
The literature review will first outline the environmental and social advantages of using SSO over food  crops.  It will address the problems with the Toronto green bin program, and how using green bin waste  for ethanol fermentation could not only solve this problem, but generate more profit from ethanol than  food crops.  The literature review will then cover basic cellulose structure, and the mechanisms by which  different pretreatments break open the material to make it amenable for enzymatic saccharification.   An introduction to enzyme action will then be provided for those not familiar with pretreatment  technology.  The introduction will be followed by a synopsis of studies that include an enzyme hydrolysis  profile, and/or hydrolysis at varied temperature, to outline the reasoning behind the conditions of the  COSLIF study.   A short synopsis of the fermentation capabilities of Z. Mobilis will also be presented, to  further explain the temperature ranges chosen for the COSLIF study.  The section on enzyme hydrolysis  will be followed by an overview of lime treatment, COSLIF treatment, and other pretreatments, so as to  provide a basis for comparison to the results of this project.   

3.1 Food versus Fuel 
As more and more crops such as maize, soy, and rapeseed are being consumed for biofuel production,  world prices for a basket of food goods have risen dramatically and people have begun to ponder the  connection.    In an article written for the World Bank, the proportion of food price increases attributed  to biofuels was estimated at 65% (Mitchell, 2008).  On the other hand, the United States Department of  Agriculture (USDA) calculated that only 13.518% of food price increases were the result of biofuels  (Mitchell, 2008).  The main difference between the percentage points quoted is the arguable link  between grain stock shortages, export bans, and speculative activity that is attributed to biofuels, as  well as the role of dietary changes in China and India with increased wealth. The International Food  Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) generated a viewpoint that is about half way between that of the USDA 

9 

and Mitchell estimates. The IFRPI impact model assessed the role of biofuels to be 33% of the food price  increases, after the mandate of biofuel substitution targets by European and North American  governments (Rosegrant, 2008).  Using the figures found by the IFPRI model, Oxfam (2008) subsequently  noted that of the 100 million people pushed into poverty by increasing food prices, 30 million would  have been put there by biofuel policies.  Whether research has shown biofuels to be responsible for 30  million in poverty, or whether it's more along the USDA lines of 10 million, everyone researching  biofuels can agree that they are playing at least a small role in food price increases.  Food based biofuels  therefore have to take a share of the responsibility in causing poverty.   The push into poverty, no  matter to what extent biofuels were responsible, should be justified by some sort of benefit.    If there  were no benefit to biofuel programs, it would be irresponsible to continue to increase hunger in the  third world. 

The two main arguments that are espoused in the media for instituting biofuel targets seem to be  energy security and environmental benefits.   The first is not rational given more attractive options. Yes,  if a country produces biofuel it needs to purchase less oil and is therefore more secure, but if it uses less  oil it also needs to buy less and is therefore more secure.  Dollar for dollar there is nothing more  effective than increasing engine efficiency for reducing the demand for gasoline.  The costs are in fact  negative, which cannot be said for biofuels.  In a Swedish study, the cost for increasing engine efficiency  was as low as 8000 Kronor, or approximately 1100 USD over the lifespan of the car; meaning that the  money saved in gasoline over the lifespan of the car, was greater than the cost of making it more  efficient (Koplow, 2007).    Therefore, until a country had at least spent enough money on efficiency  until extra improvements actually had a cost that was above zero, there is no way that biofuels from  food can be touted as a reasonable energy security initiative. 

10 

That leaves environmental benefits as the reason why European and North American governments  might claim they have justification for biofuel policy.   However, that argument only holds true if there  actually are environmental gains.  Recent articles on land use changes and the nitrogen uptake of food  crops from chemical fertilizers have disproved this myth.  In 2008, Fargione et al. did a study to show the  effect of converting land to produce crops for Biofuel.   Figure 3.1 shows that it can take as much as 423  years to repay the carbon deficit created by converting forest and grassland into cropland.   

  Figure 3.1 Carbon deficit repayment periods for ethanol production         (Fargione et al., 2008).    Row A in Figure 3.1 shows the release of carbon as the biomass on the land is either burnt, or left to  decompose. Row B attributes the proportion that biofuel is responsible for (e.g. Corn Ethanol is 83%  because only 83% of the corn is used for fuel, some of the byproduct (17%) is recovered and sold as 

11 

animal feed.   Row C represents the benefit of value of the carbon stored in the biofuel plants as they  grow over just burning gasoline.  Row D is the time in years it would take to repay the carbon released  from conversion of the land.   The effects of converting peatland rainforest to palm biodiesel production  are catastrophic.  It would take 423 years to repay the carbon debt making palm biodiesel ludicrous as  an environmental initiative.  Corn ethanol is not a reasonable option either, with a 93 year payback on  grassland, or 48 year payback on abandoned cropland.      Compounding the problem of touting biofuels from food sources as having an environmental benefit is  the fact that the gains found in "Row C" of Figure 3.1 above are widely disputed.  The numbers are  assumptions that the yearly carbon storage in crops grown for fuel would have a benefit over burning  gasoline.  A recent study by Crutzen et al. (2008) has shown that even were the fuel to  plant/fertilize/harvest/transport the crop zero, the net greenhouse gas benefit would be negative for  both corn ethanol and rapeseed biodiesel.  Crutzen et al. (2008) have suggested that because of the  nitrogen uptake efficiency of these crops from chemical fertilizers, more nitrous oxides are expelled  during growth respiration and bacterial denitrification of runoff, then carbon dioxide is saved from gas  substitution.  Though less nitrous oxides are released then carbon dioxide saved, nitrous oxides are  approximately 296 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.  Release of nitrous oxides,  combined with the fuel spent planting, fertilizing, harvesting, and transporting the crops, indicate that  the paypack periods shown in Figure 3.1, are in reality infinite.  Since the net carbon benefit is negative  compared to burning gasoline, the deficits can never be repaid, and growing of corn and rapeseed crops  for biofuel cannot be considered environmentally friendly.       Biofuels from food have been shown to be of little benefit, but that does not mean that all biofuels are  environmentally unsound.  As shown in the last column of Figure 3.1, prairie biomass (grass) grown on 

12 

abandoned crop land or land only marginally suited for crops, has either a 1 year or no carbon deficit to  pay back.  There are abundant sources of biomass whose conversion to ethanol creates no carbon debt.   Any kind of organic waste would fall into that category.  Agricultural waste like corn stover, forestry  waste like wood chips from milling, and municipal waste like the organic fraction of the garbage  collection are all prime examples.   They all contain sugars in the form of cellulose and hemicellulose,  which once broken apart can be fermented to ethanol.  The product is called cellulosic ethanol because  the ethanol is fermented from the sugars contained in the cellulose that plant matter is made of.  So if  abundant sources for cellulosic ethanol exist why do people continue to use food for biofuel?  The  answer is that to date, the process used to create cellulosic ethanol has been more expensive than food  ethanol or biodiesel.   

3.2 SSO as an ethanol feedstock ­ saving the green bin program 
Toronto's decision to collect organic waste was largely motivated by the closure of the Keele Valley  Landfill.  Keele Valley, located north of Toronto at Major Mackenzie Blvd. and Keele St., was the city's  major landfill site from it's opening in 1983 until its closure in 2002.  In 1998, in anticipation of the  closure of the Keele Valley site, Toronto began to ship its landfill waste to Michigan at an average cost of  $63 per tonne (Estey, 2006).   The contract with Michigan ends in 2010, and the U.S. Federal  Government mandated a closure of the cross border garbage shipments over security concerns.  In  response to that announcement, in 2000, the City of Toronto assembled a group, Task Force 2010, to  come up with a new waste diversion scheme.  The report issued by the task force, stated clearly the  goals of 30% residential waste diversion by 2003, 60% by 2006, and 100% by 2010 (City of Toronto,  2001). A central part of the waste diversion strategy was the Green Bin Program.    

 

13 

 

Organic kitchen and household waste would be separated by the  household and collected separately from the regular garbage in the  curbside Green Bin. That material would then either be aerobically  digested to produce compost, or anaerobically digested to produce both  electricity from methane, and a smaller amount of compost.  The  program was extremely successful in terms of participation but 

Figure 3.2  Green bin.                    a less successful public adherence to the proper materials to be placed  in the bin, has led to disastrous results.  Collection jumped 120% in two years, from 114 681 tonnes in  2005 to 251 368 tonnes in 2007 (Toronto Star, March 1, 2009).  The composting facilities Toronto was  planning on sending the waste to, did not have the capacity to handle the volume.  To compound that  problem, some of the material was not passing compost standards.  In the March 1st article in the Star,  excess waste not processed to compost was reportedly being shipped to New York, and a number of  facilities handling the waste were doing so improperly to keep up with demand.  Improper handling  forced the Ministry of the Environment to shut down facilities for odour complaints.  When the material  doesn't pass standards, it has to be shipped to a landfill as well, which defeats the purpose of a separate  collection.  In a conversation with Doug Beatty, who was managing the anaerobic processing section of  the Toronto Dufferin Transfer station in 2006, staff would often see items that do not belong in the  green bin.   They found light bulbs, metal, and hard plastics in the green bin material.   When those  materials are found even in slight amounts, the compost is inhibited from being used as a soil  enhancement for parks, forests, and especially arable farm land.  The operators of the Dufferin Transfer  station anaerobic digester have even had machinery break downs caused by a hand gun or steel bar in  the green bin material.  In the Mirzajani (2009) SSO/demolition waste characterization study, completed 

14 

as a part of this project, it was found that heavy metal concentrations often inhibited green bin material  from being used as category A compost (unrestricted use), and sometimes even category B compost  (restricted use). 

Fortunately,  if  the  material  is  processed  through  anaerobic  digestion  to  create  fuel  products  such  as  ethanol  or  methane,  the  foreign  objects  and  original  composition  of  the  green  bin  waste  becomes  irrelevant.    At  the  Dufferin  Transfer  Station,  the  compost  material  that  comes  out  of  the  methane  generation process has always passed compost standards (Doug Beatty, personal communication, 2006).   In the ethanol fermentation process, the leftover solids would be consumed in the boiler for energy.  So  if  the  project  can  prove  that  this  SSO  to  ethanol  process  can  be  cost  competitive  with  food  crop  based  ethanol,  there  will  be  incentive  to  capitalize  on  this  and  build  fermentation  facilities.    The  industrial  partner to this project, aims at demonstrating that at the pilot scale.  Successful results at pilot scale will  encourage  full  scale  adaptation,  and  create  a  demand  for  the  green  bin  waste.  This  demand  could  allow  the  City  of  Toronto  to  not  only  process  the  material  properly,  but  possibly  lower  the  $90    $127  per  tonne (Doug Beatty, personal communication, 2006) that the city is currently paying to process it. 

3.3 SSO as an ethanol feedstock  clean and cost competitive         
No additional land is required to generate the scraps of food and paper products that are thrown in the  garbage.  Therefore the carbon deficit created by food crops for biofuel discussed in the Section 3.1  does not apply to SSO.  Similarly, no additional nitrogen oxides will be released from the respiration of  crops during chemical fertilizer uptake.  Additionally, no fuel will be consumed in the planting/harvesting  and transportation of crops.   It does take fuel to deliver the SSO to the ethanol plant, but if the plant is  located near a city, like the Dufferin Transfer station in Toronto, that fuel will be far less than what is  used in alternative transport to a landfill, which is usually a lot further from city centers. 

15 

In 2006, according to manager Doug Beatty, the Dufferin Transfer station was being paid a tipping fee of  $127 per tonne to process the green bin material.   At that time, Toronto was collecting 30% less SSO  than they are now (Toronto Star, March 1, 2009).  This signifies a potentially feasible opportunity in the  event that SSO is proved a viable feedstock for ethanol.  In 2002, the NREL in conjunction with the Harris  Group, published a comprehensive cost assessment study for lignocellulosic ethanol.  Figure 3.3 shows  the NREL assessed the cost of biomass to be 31% of the total costs.   

 

  Figure 3.3 Cost contribution of lignocellulose plant details (NREL, 2002).   

In the same paper, the delivered cost of the corn stover was stated as $30 per dry tonne.   In  comparison, the cost of the delivered green bin waste is negative $ 127 per wet tonne.  The moisture  content of the pure SSO sample received for this study was 81.6% (Table 4.1).  To make the moisture  content more conservative for representing an average sample, a value of 75% is assumed.  That would  mean the solid content is only 25%, and the delivered cost of a dry tonne of SSO is negative $ 508.  Table  3.1 shows the conversion of that negative biomass cost into a negative cost per gallon of ethanol  generated.

* Mirzajani, (2009), figures taken from a 6 month study in seasonal fluctuation of mixed SSO and softwood.  ** Assume the price of the material blended with the SSO to be twice the price of the NREL estimate for corn  stover to be conservative.  Even though for this particular supply, the wood waste is free.   

Since the market price of ethanol futures is currently under $ 2 per gallon (Barchart.com, May 2010)  more money can be made from processing the SSO than in selling the ethanol produced.    If the SSO  was being processed at an ideal, 2000 metric tonne per day plant, as in the NREL (2002) assessment, this  biomass negative cost would be three times the price of the projected total cost of $ 1.07 per gallon.   However, the major hurdle to exploiting SSO fermentation is that the technology of SSO to ethanol  conversion is unproven, and therefore a pilot scale facility would be more likely until the results  encourage scaleup.   Figure 3.4 shows the rise of nonfeedstock costs because of loses in economies of  scale for smaller facilities. 

17 

  Figure 3.4   Ethanol cost as a function of plant size (NREL, 2002).    The highest point on the graph appears to be about 250 MT / day, which is large for a pilot plant.  The  capacity of Toronto's Dufferin Transfer station anaerobic digestion plant is only about 70 MT / day.  To  model what the increase in cost might be for 70MT / day, the trend of increase in nonfeedstock costs  can be continued along the green line in Figure 3.4 above. There is an increase in nonfeedstock costs  per gallon of 10 cents between 2000 MT and 1000MT, then about 15 cents between 1000 and 500, and  finally almost 20 cents between 500 and 250.  Therefore, the increase from 250 MT to 125MT should be  about 25 cents, and the increase from 125MT to 67.5MT about 30 cents.  At that pilot scale size, the  total nonfeedstock costs would then be approximately $1.20 + $ 0.25 + $ 0.30 = $1.75 per gallon  ethanol produced.  Even in the unlikely event that the distillation  and pretreatment costs were doubled  for a lower sugar content and a more recalcitrant biomass, the price would only rise to $ 1.75 + $ 0.54 =  $ 2.29.  (Pretreatment is 19%, and distillation 12% of total cost (Figure 3.4). Extra Cost  1.75  x 0.31 =  0.54). The negative biomass cost would still pay for the entire process.  

18 

In light of these facts, there is an almost desperate need to prove the viability of SSO as an ethanol  feedstock.   It would not only be good for the environment, but have obvious financial investment  benefits.  With a negative cost associated with production, larger facilities would be inevitable, enabling  cost decreases with economies of scale, as well as additional demand for the SSO.  As demand for the  SSO increased, the government would be able to lower the tipping fee incentive paid, hopefully to the  point that a separate organics collection would be cheaper than landfilling.  In fact, if the tipping fee  dropped to  $ 63 / wet tonne, the price Toronto was paying to ship the material to Michigan in 1998  (Estey, 2006), then the biomass cost would drop to  $1.48.  With a minimum selling price of $1.50/  gallon, the price of ethanol futures before the rise in gasoline prices in August 2009 (Barchart.com), the  revenue would be $2.98 / gallon produced, enough to overcome even the inflated pilot scale costs of  $2.29 / gallon and clear a healthy profit.

3.4 Cellulose structure 
Cellulose is a part of the makeup of plant cell walls, and is the most abundant component of plant  biomass (Lynd et al., 2002)  Cellulose is a polymer of repeated cellobiose molecules joined by 14  glucosic bonds.  Since cellobiose is made up of two D(+) glucose molecules, linked by the 14 glucosic  bonds, cellulose can also be considered  a series of glucose molecules.    That chain of cellobiose/glucose  molecules can run as long as 25000 glucan residues (Desvaux, 2005).    Figure 3.5 is a good  representation of the molecular chain and how those chains fit into a fibril of cellulose. 

  Figure 3.5 Structure of cellulose and cellulose fibril (Desvaux, 2005).      The crystalline region above represents the cellulose chains, and the amorphous region hemicellulose.   Hemicellulose is made up of much shorter chains of five and six carbon sugars:  xylose and arabinose  (five carbon), as well as mannose, galactose, and glucose (six carbon).  When lignin fills the spaces  between the cellulose and hemicellulose in the cell wall, the substance is also referred to as  lignocellulose.   If one imagines the cross section of one of the microfibrils above, it would look as if  wrapped in a protective lignin coating (Figure 3.6).  

20 

 

 

Figure 3.6 Cross section of cellulose microfibril (Gupta, 2008).                                                                                                                 

Breaking past this lignin barrier, to get access to the sugars found in the cellulose and   hemicellulose, is the function of chemical pretreatment.  

 

3.5 Pretreatment 
The goal of pretreatment is to hydrolyze the cellulose and hemicellose found in biomass to monomeric  sugars.   The three processes typically used for ethanol fermentation are dilute acid, concentrated acid,  and enzymatic saccharification (Broder et al., 1995); of which enzymatic saccharification is the most  common (Kumar et al., 2009).  Enzymatic saccharification is common enough that when most papers  discuss pretreatment, they are referring to the chemical or physical pretreatment necessary to disrupt  the lignocellulose structure and expose the cellulose to enzymatic attack.            

"Pretreatment is required to alter the structure of cellulosic biomass to                                        make cellulose more accessible to the enzymes that convert the carbohydrate polymers into  fermentable sugars" (Mosier et al., 2005).  

21 

In this paper, pretreatment will be taken to have that meaning as well.  Without pretreatment, the  protective lignin layer between microbrils renders the glucosic bonds of the cellulose inaccessible to  enzymes, limiting hydrolysis yields to under 20% of theoretical (Lynd et al., 2002).  With pretreatment,  the hydrolysis yields of glucose and xylose from cellulose and hemicellulose can reach over 95% of  theoretical (Eggman and Elander, 2005).  Figure 3.7 illustrates the purpose of pretreatment in preparing  a cellulose microfibril for enzyme saccharification. 

 

  Figure 3.7   Effect of pretreatment on cellulose microfibril (Kumar et al., 2009).   

The goal is to break the lignin shield surrounding each microfibril, as well as disrupt the crystalline  structure of the cellulose (Mosier et al., 2005).    

Physical pretreatments include:  dry and wet vibratory ball milling, compression milling, steam  explosion, hot water, and hydrothermolysis (Mosier et al., 2005).  Chemical pretreatments include:  Concentrated mineral acids (H2SO4, HCl), ammonia based solvents (NH3, Hydrazine), alkaline H2O2,  NaOH, Ca(OH)2,ozone, organosolv (Lexis acids, FeCl3, (Al)2SO4 in aqueous alcohols), glycerol, dioxane,  phenol, ethylene glycol, aprotic solvents (DMSO), and metal complexes (ferric sodium tartrate, cadoxen, 

22 

and cuoxan) (Mosier et al., 2005).  Biological pretreatment is possible as well, the most effective being  an application of whiterot fungi, which excrete lignin degrading enzymes (Kumar et al., 2009).  Despite the fact that there are numerous pretreatment processes, only steam explosion, hot water  treatment, dilute acid, flow through acid, ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX), ammonia recycle percolation  (ARP), and Lime are considered cost effective (Mosier et al., 2005)  Each of these technologies works to  either remove or alter lignin and/or hemicellulose.  By achieving one or the other, or both, accessible  surface area is increased, because porosity is increased by a combination of hemicellulose solubilization,  lignin solubilization, and lignin redistribution (Lynd et al., 2002).   Table 3.2 summarizes the effects that  each of these pretreatments has on the chemical composition and structure of lignocellulose.

3.6 Enzyme hydrolysis 
Following pretreatment, the sugars in the treated biomass are hydrolyzed by enzymes excreted from  cellulolytic organisms.  These organisms excrete extra cellular cellulase and xylanase which break the      14  glycosidic bonds of polysaccharide cellulose and hemicellulose, into monosaccharide and  oligosaccharide sugars.  The monosaccharide sugars can be consumed by the cellulolytic organism itself,  or other saccharolytic organisms.  The most common system today is the breakdown of cellulose with  enzymes from the fungi Trichoderma reesei, followed by a fermentation using the saccharolytic yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisea (baker's yeast).   

The three major components/activities of cellulase are: endoglucanases, exoglucanases (also called  cellodextrinases), and ßglucosidases.   "Endoglucanases cut at random at internal amorphous sites in the cellulose polysaccharide  chain, generating oligosaccharides of various lengths and consequently new chain ends.  Exoglucanases act in a processive manner on the reducing or nonreducing ends of cellulose  polysaccharide chains, liberating either glucose (glucanohydrolases) or cellobiose  (cellobiohydrolase) as major products. Exoglucanases can also act on microcrystalline cellulose,  presumably peeling cellulose chains from the microcrystalline structure (Teeri, 97).                       ßglucosidases hydrolyze soluble cellodextrins and cellobiose to glucose"   (Lynd et al., 2002)     The activities of the cellulase components are illustrated in Figure 3.8. 

 

 

25 

  Figure 3.8  Schematic representation of T. reesei cellulase action on a cellulose microfibril         (Adapted from Lynd et al., 2002). 

The enzymes needed for the system shown above can either be generated onsite, or purchased from a  supplier.  The two largest enzyme suppliers in the world are Genencor International, and Novozymes  Biotech (NREL, 2002).  They have both dramatically reduced the cost of cellulase through research and  development partnerships with the United States Department of Energy (DOE).   The Accellerase 1500  enzyme cocktail produced by Genencor was previously found to be more effective on COSLIF treated  material than a mixture of Celluclast and Novozyme 188, produced by Novozymes (Ehsanipour, 2010).    Genencor has since released an Accellerase Duet enzyme cocktail that is advertised to have 3 times the  activity level of Accellerase 1500.  For those reasons, the Accellerase 1500 enzyme cocktail was used for  the experiments in this study.  An attempt to acquire Accellerase Duet was made, but it is only for sale  by the tonne or tanker.

To assess the effectiveness of enzymes on biomass, a common language for dosage was developed by  the NREL from the cellulase studies of Ghose (1987) and Miller (1959).   Dosage is reported by the  addition of activity units per gram glucan, glucose, or dry biomass.   The activity units are called Filter  Paper Units (FPU) because the procedure to find the activity level involves solving for the concentration  of cellulase that will convert 4 % of a 50 mg strip of Whatman filter paper to 2.0 mg of glucose in 1 hour.   The NREL procedure for measurement of cellulase activity can be found in APPENDIX 3. 

Since this paper will include enzyme hydrolysis profiles for the COSLIF treatment, at varying enzyme  loadings and temperatures, a number of studies were examined to find the conditions which would  allow for comparison of the results.  The studies were chosen for their prominence in journal article  citations, similarity to the mixed SSO hardwood and softwood feedstock, and/or pretreatment process.     Table 3.3 contains a summary of the conditions/finding of those studies.

Major Points found in studies shown in Table 3.3 are:  ·

There are usually three to four loadings tested. The loadings under 7.5 or 10 FPU consistently  deliver too little sugar. 

·

Most studies find little difference between 15 and 60 FPU, but there are exceptions in Steinberg  et al. (2000), as well as Kumar and Wyman (2009).  Those studies tested softwood and poplar, 

28 

woods similar to the demolition and forestry waste used in this study, therefore larger loadings  may be necessary.  · · · Xylanase can be more effective than additional cellulase but not always.  Temperature effects have varied; best results between 40 and 50 °C.  There can be large differences in conversion at different temperatures (Sharma et al., 2002),  however there can also be little difference within similar ranges, (Saha, 2009).  · 0, 24, and 72 hours are the most common sampling times. 

From this summary, 0, 12, 24 and 72 hours were chosen for the sampling times.  Though a 12 hour  sample wasn't taken in some studies, the Zhang et al. (2007) study found that most of the sugar had  been released by 12 hours.  Therefore a 12 hour figure could be needed to establish the plateau for  conversion efficiency.  Since conversion efficiencies seemed to drop off below 10 FPU / g glucan  loadings, 10 FPU was at first chosen as the lowest of the loading range.  When it was discovered as the  most cost efficient in later testing, 5 FPU / g glucan was added to the 35 °C hydrolysis testing.   The  addition of xylanase instead of cellulase from lower loading would have been a good idea.   However,  Genencor's new product line, Accellerase Duet, already includes xylanase supplementation.    Therefore  as xylanase will be present in the cellulase cocktail in the event of commercialization, there is no need to  test for whether it should be added. 

There could be a large or small difference in temperature effects, therefore hydrolysis at 30, 35 and      40 °C should be assessed to find the enzymes best pairing temperature for simultaneous saccharification  and cofermentation (SSCF).  As discussed in previous papers associated with this project (Mirzajani,  2009; Ehsanipour, 2010), the SSCF process was chosen because it allows for saccharification of the  biomass sugars and subsequent fermentation to ethanol in one step.  The Cofermentation aspect refers  to the fact that xylose and glucose are both fermented in the same digester, instead of separate 

29 

fermentations using different microorganisms.  Therefore the fermenting microbe used for the process  must be able to utilize both xylose and glucose.  Zymomonas mobilis, strain 8b, is a rapidly saccharolytic  bacteria capable of just that.   Since Z. mobilis was chosen for the fermentation studies of future  research associated with this project, the temperature range studied in this paper, 30, 35 and 40°C,  would cover the middle ground between maximum enzyme digestion and ideal bacterial conditions.   Figure 3.9 shows the fermentation profile of Z. mobilis at 30 and 37 °C.  Even spiked with acetate, the  inhibition of the bacteria is little enough that it can utilize the sugars within 24 hrs.  Ideally, if the   Accellerase 1500 enzyme cocktail can solubilize sugars at 30 °C, as fast as at 50 °C , then the SSCF system  would be the fastest possible.  Even if the enzymes are capable of solubilizing the sugar in 24 hours at   35 or 40 °C, it would still be an incredible leap forward in comparison to SSCF systems with other  pretreatments.

3.7 Pretreatment effectiveness 
Pretreatment effectiveness is judged by hydrolysis yields and/or overall yields.  The overall yield is a  measure of the combined sugars released during pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis,  compared to the total sugar existing in the initial biomass.  Hydrolysis yields are a measure of the sugars  released during enzyme action, compared to the total sugars available in the post pretreated biomass.   Table 3.4 summarizes some of the pretreatment efficiencies of studies similar to those covered in this  paper (long term lime and COSLIF), as well as the other technologies previously mentioned as currently  cost effective.  The top technologies are generally in the 90 % overall conversion range when it comes to  a feedstock like corn stover.    However, when both dilute acid and the COSLIF method are used on a  more recalcitrant biomass like softwood, the yield is much lower.

3.8 Long term lime pretreatment 
Long term lime treatment is the application of Ca(OH)2 at ambient pressure and moderate temperature  over a relatively long period of time (weeks not hours).  Kim (2005) first evaluated the technique on corn  stover with temperatures ranging from 25 to 55 °C.   In that study, both oxidative and nonoxidative  conditions were experimented with by supplying the sample with either compressed air or nitrogen.   The oxidative condition was far more effective in solubilizing lignin, which made for increased enzymatic  digestion.  Four weeks at 55 °C was found to be the optimal time and temperature.   Further treatment  caused solubilization of the biomass sugars.  Since only the solids are passed on to enzyme hydrolysis in  this system, solubilization of the sugars in the pretreatment liquor was a negative. 

The treatment was repeated by Ramirez (2005) on poplar wood using the same equipment and  conditions.   In the Ramirez (2005) study a 65 °C temperature was tested as well, and the study ended  on the fourth week.   Week four at 65 °C was found to be the peak of conversion, though no plateau had  been reached.  Therefore further treatment and/or a higher temperature could have resulted in higher  digestibility.  Again, the oxidative condition was far more effective than the nonoxidative. 

In light of the optimal and near optimal conditions above, 55, 65, and 75 °C were chosen for the  temperature range in this study of SSO mixed with forestry waste (hardwood).   Oxygen was supplied to  all samples, since it would be redundant to test nonoxidative conditions while expecting lower  conversions.  The test was initially planned to run 6 weeks in order to attempt to reach a plateau with  the hardwood in the samples.   However, equipment failure led to the 55 °C only being tested for 3  weeks, and the 75 °C sample for 5 weeks. 

Figure 3.10 shows the experimental setup for the Kim (2005), and Ramirez (2005) studies.

  Figure 3.10   Experimental setup for Kim (2005) and Ramirez (2005) long term lime studies. 

The compressed air line in Figure 3.10 shows the air passing through lime slurry to scrub CO2, as well as  the water tank, which is set to the desired sample temperature.  The reasoning for that is to prevent the  air from changing the temperature in the samples, or reacting with the lime.  Those conditions were  repeated in this study. 

In both studies, the pretreatment yield (mass of components remaining in relation to their initial mass  before pretreatment) was found by quantitative saccharification of the pretreated material.  The results  for temperatures of 55 and 65 °C are shown in Table 3.5.

3.9 COSLIF pretreatment 
The Cellulose solventOrganic solvent Lignocellulosic Fractionation method of pretreatment involves  using phosphoric acid at ambient pressure and moderate temperature (50 °C) to disrupt the bonds of  lignin, dissolve cellulose and hemicellulose fibrils by breaking the hydrogen bonds between chains,  weakly hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose, and remove acetyle groups from hemicellulose.   The  material is then washed in acetone or ethanol to precipitate the partially dissolved cellulose and 

35 

hemicellulose, and dissolve some of the lignin (Zhang et al., 2007).  Figure 3.11 shows the COSLIF  process configuration.   

  Figure 3.11   COSLIF process configuration (Zhang et al., 2007).    Operation 6 in Figure 3.11, shows the separation of acetone and phosphoric acid which are then  recycled to be used again.  If the recycle efficiencies are high enough that the solvent costs can compete  with other pretreatments, the COSLIF process offers a number of advantages:  1. The separation of hemicellulose shown in Operation 7 of Figure 3.11, allows for separate  processing, which can be worth a lot more than the ethanol revenue from fermentation.   Hemicellulose has been used as plant gum for thickeners, adhesives, protective colloids,  emulsifiers and stabilizers (Zhang et al., 2007).  Consequently, hemicellulose and its derivates 

36 

have a 520 fold selling price over the value to be gained by selling ethanol from hemicelluloses  fermentation (Zhang et al., 2007)  2. There is no need for a special reactor, as there would be for dilute acid treatment.  No special  reactor is needed because phosphoric acid is less corrosive than sulphuric acid, the reactor  vessel operates at ambient pressure, and the temperature is also a very moderate 50 °C.   (As shown in Operation 1 of Figure 3.11)  3. The hydrolysis yields are not only very high, but extremely fast.  According to Yang and Wyman  (2008), one of the factors involved in achieving an advanced low cost pretreatment, is that the  pretreated cellulose should be able to yield over 90 % conversion in less than 5, and preferably  less than 3 days.  Figure 3.12 shows the hydrolysis profile of corn stover, poplar wood, and  douglas fir.  The conversions are at 94% by 12 hours, and 97% by 24 hours, for corn stover and  poplar wood.  The conversions are equally fast but not as high at 75% for douglas fir, but that  speaks more to the recalcitrant nature of softwoods than a failing of the process.                         

37

To illustrate how fast these rates are, Figure 3.13 shows the hydrolysis profile for Lime and AFEX treated  biomass.   To  compare  fairly,  the  top  line  in  the  Lime  study  is  at  an  enzyme  loading  of  15  FPU  /  g  glucan,  as  are  the  COSLIF  studies  above.

  Figure 3.13  Enzyme hydolysis profile for lime (A) and AFEX (B) studies             (Kaar et al., 2000; Teymouri et al., 2005).    The  COSLIF  method  was  previously  studied  as  a  part  of  this  overall  project,  by  Ehsanipour  (2010),  who  found  the  ideal  timing  of  the  phosphoric  acid  hydrolysis  (2hr),  estimated  overall  yield  at  a  high  enzyme  loading  of  60  FPU  cellulase  /  g  glucan  (89.5%),  and  solved  the  question  of  which  commercial  enzyme  cocktail  worked  best  (Accellerase  1500).    In  addition,  she  found  that  ethanol  was  a  more  effective  organic  solvent  for  the  light  liquor  washing  procedure.    This  study  built  on  the  results  of  Ehsanipour  (2010),  utilizing  the  same  treatment  method,  to  seek  a  more  precise  answer  for  the  overall  glucose  yield,  present the hydrolysis profile of the waste digestion, and estimate the best enzyme conditions for  cost effective fermentation. 

39 

4 MATERIALS AND PREPARATION METHODS 
Two types of feedstock were investigated for their amenability to long term lime and COSLIF  pretreatment:  SourceSeparated Organic Waste (SSO) mixed with softwood, and SSO mixed with  hardwood.   The softwood and hardwood used in the blend are from other lignocellulosic waste streams  available in Toronto.  The softwood chips were taken from ground demolition waste, and the hardwood  chips from live and dead tree clippings.   The tree clippings were from parks and residential areas  (municipal forestry waste) in the city of Toronto.   The term softwood is used to represent the  demolition waste because of the higher proportion of softwoods used in building construction,  especially older structures.  Douglas Fir and Cedar are two examples.  Our feedstock supplier confirmed  that the demolition wood was mainly softwood, and that the forestry waste from the city of Toronto  was mainly hardwood, like maple, birch, and poplar (Mike Crupi, Vartek Industrial; personal  communication). 

There are three main reasons why adding woodchips is an advantage for a mixed SSO feedstock:    ·

Source separated organic waste composition is variable, as people's diets and waste patterns  can vary over the seasons.  Highly variable sugar levels can cause a modeling problem when  estimating many of the parameters of the system.  Higher sugar levels require the addition of  more enzyme, and longer residence times.   Therefore adding woodchips would add a steadying  amount of cellulose/hemicellulose to the feedstock stream, and provide a buffer against this  variability. 

·

Organic waste has an odour, which can be a problem for feedstock storage; as one can imagine  from the smell of a green bin in Toronto.  However, when processed at high heat and pressure  in the thermal screw, 150 °C and 50 Bar (Mirzajani, 2009), most of the bacteria in the material is  destroyed, halting or slowing its decomposition; thereby removing the cause of the odour.  In  40 

order to accomplish this, a dry material has to be added to the wet green bin waste to increase  the mixed materials frictional resistance within the screw.    · The wood chips in this case arise from other waste sources, thereby providing an  environmentally friendly mix, with little or no extra cost. 

Testing the SSO mixed with softwood in the COSLIF process has another advantage.   Since the high  lignin composition of softwood makes it extremely hard to break down, a high sugar yield of treated  SSO/softwood would be an indication that the SSO could be mixed with almost anything organic, and  also achieve high yields in that process. 

 

4.1 Feedstock preparation 
All material was processed by a thermal screw belonging to Vartek Industrial.  The screw administrates  high pressure and temperature from the application of friction forces as the material is pressed and  screwed through the chamber.  The product that leaves the screw is pulverized to the extent that even  tiny hairlike projections from the mulched, more homogenized material can be seen.  The processed  material is relatively odourless.   Figure 4.1 shows the before and after look of the material. 

 

  Figure 4.1  SSO material before and after thermal screw. 

 

41 

After the sample has been processed by the screw, it was mixed in a pile and a portion sent to the  laboratory for testing.  To increase the homogeneity of the sample, as well as enable comparison with  similar studies, the standard NREL procedure "Preparation of Samples for Compositional Analysis,  method B" was followed as closely as possible (Hames et al., 2005) The NREL procedure is so widely  used it could be called standard protocol (Zhang et al., 1996; Teymouri et al, 2005; Wyman et al., 2005;  Kim, 2005; Ramirez,2005).  A synopsis of the procedure used in these experiments is as follows:  1. Samples not being dried immediately are to be stored in a refrigerator freezer (04°C).     2. Samples to be dried are spread thinly, (< 1") on trays previously dried at 44°C and weighed.  3. Samples are dried at < 45°C for 4896 hours, and then reweighed until the weight decrease on  an hourly basis is less than 1.0%, and the moisture content below 10.0%.  4. Samples are then ground/milled further before being sieved.  The material that passes a No.20  (0.841mm) ASTME11 screen, but is retained on the No.80 (0.180mm) sieve are kept to be used  for the remainder of the experimentation.   (The milling was accomplished by simple Hamilton  Beach and Cuisinart coffee grinders.)  5. Samples once again are kept in a refrigerator freezer (04°C) until use.  In addition, samples are well mixed in bag before being withdrawn for experiments.    Figure 4.2 is a visual representation of the material through the various steps of this process.

One of the problems in working with a heterogeneous feedstock is that a careful balance has to be  struck in the milling process, between chopping the wood into small enough pieces, and not over 

42 

grinding the SSO to ash (< No. 80 sieve).    The SSO/wood mixes were ground in an attempt to achieve  about a 50% usable ratio (50% of the total particles between the No. 20 and 80 sieves).   Using Hamilton  Beach or Cuisinart coffee grinders, this meant holding and compressing the grind button for  approximately two seconds, three times repeatedly.  Figure 4.3 shows the homogenization proportions.

4.2 Compositional analysis 
The sugar, lignin, and ash composition of the mixed biomass was determined by quantitative  saccharification using the NREL standard procedure, "Determination of Structural Carbohydrates and  Lignin in Biomass" (Sluiter et al., 2008).  Analysis was carried out by High Performance Liquid  Chromatography (HPLC), using an Aminex HPX97P column with Refractive Index (RI) detector.  The full  procedure undertaken can be found in Appendix 1.  The process consists of adding 300 mg of material  to concentrated acid for an hour, then diluting the acid and raising the temperature to 121°C for a  further hour.  The sugars contained in the cellulose and hemicellulose are solubilized, while lignin and  ash remain.   The liquid is adjusted closer to neutral and tested by HPLC to quantify the sugars.  The  remaining material once filtered, is weighed after spending 24 hours at 105 °C, and again after time  spent in a 575 °C muffle furnace, to determine the amount of lignin.   

An attempt was made to adapt a procedure slightly different to the NREL standard procedure in order to  lower the variation between samples.  All of the standard procedures were followed in saccharification  of the samples, but instead of removing 20ml of liquid to neutralize and test by HPLC, 10ml from each of   three samples were taken instead, and combined to form a single HPLC tested sample.   For each run, 30  samples were combined to make 10 for testing, in effect increasing the sampling size from 0.3 g to 0.9 g,  in an attempt to lower variation.   It should be noted that a scale sensitive to 1 mg was used, not 0.1 mg  as stipulated by the standard procedure.  Therefore the percentage figures of the components are  reported only to the first decimal place.  The compositional proportions for the sugar and lignin results  of both substrates are shown in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3.  The mannan and arabinan components were  grouped together, because even in the analysis of the pure sugar standards, the mannose and arabinose  peaks were indistinguishable.

The compositional analysis of the SSO mixed with softwood falls within range of typical values for this  material, established by an extensive six month study of seasonal fluctuation, performed in association  with this project.  Table 4.4 shows the variability of glucan and lignin proportions in the seasonal  fluctuation of SSO mixed with softwood, over a six month period.

Component  Average  Glucan  95 % CI  Average  Lignin  95 % CI    Each average value in Table 4.4 refers to the average of ten tests, each of which had 10 samples.   Therefore, the figures for each month are an average of 100 samples.  The confidence interval for the  average value refers to a confidence interval generated from the standard deviation between the  averages of the ten sets of samples tested each month.

A separate analysis of the mixed SSO and softwood used for this experiment was performed by MBI  International.   The results on average were 26.8 % glucan, 5.4 % xylan, 1.2 % arabinan, 5.7 % mannan,  and 1.2 % galactan (Ehsanipour, 2010).  These values lie within the range found in this compositional  analysis, with a slight difference in xylan and galactan.  The larger galactan and smaller xylan numbers  could be a result of the proximity of those peaks in HPLC analysis.  In fact, the galactan peak, while  visually present on the Chromatogram, was not detected in the analysis program.  Therefore the peak  was determined by manual correction.  The manual correction may have been overcorrected.  The  average result of 29.3 % glucan was used for subsequent COSLIF calculations for pretreatment yield as  well as overall yield.   Since 29.3 % glucan is high, in light of the MBI International findings for the same 

46 

material, the pretreatment and overall yields found in the results section may be on the conservative  side.  

 

NOTE FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH BIOMASS NOMENCLATURE:   

Initial sugar proportions are traditionally reported in the polymetric form. Glucan is the total glucose  found in cellulose and hemicellulose.  Since it has yet to be hydrolyzed, which will add mass from  water bonds, there are anhydrous corrections to find the glucose available.  The anhydrous correction  from glucose to glucan is 0.9, therefore every 0.9 grams of glucan yields 1.0 gram of glucose in  hydrolysis.  The xylose to xylan correction is 0.88.

5 STUDY METHODOLOGY 
The NREL standard procedure, "Determination of Structural Carbohydrates and Lignin in Biomass" as  well as a slightly modified version (larger sample size) of the NREL, "Enzymatic Saccharification of  Biomass" procedure, were used to determine pretreatment yields, hydrolysis yields, and overall yields of  xylose and glucose, as well as the change in lignin content.  The first procedure will furthermore be  referred to as quantitative saccharification, and the second procedure as enzymatic saccharification.   The full explanation of the steps involved in the quantitative and enzymatic saccharifications done for  this project, as well as the equations for calculations, can be found in Appendix 1, and Appendix 2.   A  brief description of quantitative saccharification can be found in the Section 4.2, and the outline of the  enzymatic saccharifications performed is as follows: 

1. A known amount of dry biomass was added to a known amount of buffer solution (pH 4.8).    2. Enzymes of a known activity level were added to the mixture and incubated on a shaker at 50°C,  and at a speed great enough to suspend the solids.  3. A sample was taken to be tested by HPLC, at different time intervals up to 72 hours.  4. The hydrolysis yield was found by Equation 5.3 and Equation 5.4.   (Total liquid multiplied by the  sugars determined in mg/ml by HPLC, divided by the available sugar in the dry biomass)    The activity level of the enzymes in Filter Paper Units (FPU) was determined by the NREL standard  procedure, "Measurement of Cellulase Activities".  The procedure followed, as well as the activity  results for both the lime treatment and COSLIF treatment, can be found in Appendix 3.    Figure 5.1 shows a schematic diagram for the overall, pretreatment, and hydrolysis yields.  Figure 5.1  indicates the positions in the process that measurements and saccharifications were performed as well.

  Figure 5.1 Schematic diagram of yields and testing. 

Dry mass was determined by moisture tests at point A, and a quantitative saccharification was  performed to find the compositional proportions of the material.  Dry mass and saccharification  procedures were repeated at point B, and the difference in values determined the pretreatment yield.    After the enzyme saccharification, the sugars found in mg/ml by HPLC analysis were compared to the  quantitative saccharification results of B, and the hydrolysis yield determined.  The pretreatment yield,  multiplied by the enzyme saccharification yield, is the overall yield.  Equations 5.1 through 5.5, illustrate  how these values are derived.

Since the purpose of the COSLIF testing was to understand the  enzyme loadings needed for the pretreated solid material, the xylose yields and quantities in the liquid  residue were ignored. 

50 

Unfortunately, for lime pretreatment, this procedure could not be used to find the various yields.   A  calculation using the initial quantitative saccharification, a modified version of the NREL enzymatic  saccharification, and pretreatment yields from similar experiments were used.  The reason for the  modified calculation is that the material evidenced behavior different from that of other types of  biomass, and could not be tested by quantitative saccharification.  At point B in Figure 5.1, a  quantitative saccharification needs to be performed to find the sugar content and change in lignin.   When the lignin results from the first week were compiled, the compositional proportion was not  possible.  The mass of the lignin remaining after the quantitative saccharification had increased beyond  even what might be possible if no lignin had been solubilized.  In some cases the lignin content showing  after the saccharification was as high as 68%.  This meant that the saccharification results could not be  valid as some of the sugars had not been solubilized.   The enzyme saccharification results were  incorrect as well, and it wasn't until they were redone that the answer to the mystery presented itself.   In one instance, only half of the pretreated material to be tested was added to the citrate buffer  solution.  Since a simultaneous enzyme saccharification was intended, those samples were placed in the  refrigerator overnight.  In the morning, the samples were checked again for pH before addition of  enzyme.  It was found that the pH had risen in the buffered solution from 4.8 to upwards of 7.0.  This  meant that there must have been some residual lime in the sample, not previously neutralized by pH  adjustment following the washing procedure.   The unusual amount of washing needed to stabilize pH  (dozens of washes), that hadn't been reported in similar studies (Kim, 2005; Ramirez,2006), led to the  suspicion that the lime had formed some sort of bond with the mixed SSO material.  Repeated washing  and pH adjustment were not enough to overcome this bond.  Steps were taken to counteract this for  both the enzyme saccharification and quantitative saccharification needed at point B in Figure 5.1.  The  samples for the first two weeks were adjusted to 4.8 for the enzyme saccharification, and then left in  the refrigerator overnight.  The samples were readjusted to 4.8 again and then kept overnight and 

51 

checked before addition of enzyme.  The pH was then checked at the end of 72 hrs.  In the majority of  samples the pH was found to be above 4.8, but not above 6.0, where the enzymes would be  deactivated.   In the next round of samples (weeks 3 and 4), the pH was adjusted to 4.8 using 1M citric  acid while still in the DDW wash, checked repeatedly, adjusted back to 4.8 when needed, and then dried  after the solution was stable.   After adding the dried pretreated material to the citrate buffer, the  samples were kept in the refrigerator overnight, and in most cases required pH readjustment.  After 24  hours, the solution was checked for pH.  In all cases, the samples again needed pH readjustment, and  the addition of more enzymes because of pH deactivation.   In samples from week 3 on, this adjustment  and addition of enzymes took place twice, and the solution in some cases still rose to a pH of almost 7.0.    When calculating the sugar conversions from the HPLC analysis, the extra ml of citric acid and enzyme  were added to the total ml of the solution.   

Since the lime was forming an unidentified bond with the mixed SSO material, great enough to  overcome release at a pH of 4.8 in the final rinsing solution, the quantitative saccharification results for  point B in Figure 5.1 were unlikely to be accurate.  To ensure that this was true, week six of the  SSO/hardwood mix was tested.   The result was that only 15% of the material was glucose.  A 15%  composition figure was impossible, given that the material started at 34%, and should have been rising.   Therefore the quantitative saccharification at point B in Figure 5.1 was found to be unreliable.   The  pretreatment and hydrolysis yields, and by extension the overall yields, were not possible to find  through normal methods.  Consequently, an approximation to find the overall yields had to be found to  link the enzyme saccharification results to the initial quantitative saccharification.   To solve this  problem, the pretreatment composition ratios of long term lime studies at similar conditions were used  to approximate the losses in sugars and other components throughout the pretreatment.  Table 5.1  shows pretreatment yields of sugar and nonsugar components found from the literature review of  other long term lime studies, as well as what was used to approximate those values for this study.

The smaller the pretreatment yield, the lower the conversion for overall sugars will be.  Therefore to be  conservative, the values showing the most reduction from either study were used.  At 65 °C, since there 

53 

was not a consistent loss of more sugar with higher heat in the Ramirez (2005) study, the values from  the 55 °C Kim (2005) study were used and not adjusted lower because of additional heat.  For the ash,  extractives, lignin, and acetyle components however, the Ramirez (2005) study showed a 12 % drop in  weeks 2 and 4 from the additional heat.  Therefore, the lower Kim (2005) numbers were used, but  adjusted down 12 %; the difference between the Ramirez (2005) and Kim (2005) studies.   There was no  data for 75 °C, therefore the conversions found at 65 °C were used.  Since the overall conversion  efficiencies calculated for the SSO/hardwood mix at 75 °C were not commercially viable, or greater than  conversion at 65 °C, extrapolation of conversion values from 55 and 65 °C was deemed unnecessary.      

5.1 Adapted method to calculate overall lime treatment yields 
In a normal situation, the enzyme yield results from the HPLC, divided by the multiplication of the dry  mass by the postpretreatment quantitative saccharification proportions would solve the hydrolysis  yield (Equations 5.3, 5.4).    The hydrolysis yield would then be multiplied by the pretreatment yield to  find the overall yield.  In this case, the enzyme yield results from the HPLC, were divided by the  multiplication of the dry mass to an estimated conversion from the original quantitative saccharification  (Equation 5.6), which includes the pretreatment yield, to solve for the overall yield.   The conversion  equations are found on the following page.

Example of the adapted method   Conventional Procedure:  Initial Proportions (From initial quantitative saccharification):    · 30 g glucose  · 10 g xylose  · 10 g other sugars  · 50 g ash, extractives, lignin and acetyle (AELA)      Total = 100 g    After 1 week of treatment at 55 °C, the quantitative saccharification of the dried out material shows that  all sugars are reduced by 10%, and the AELA is reduced by 50%.  Pretreatment yields are then 90% for  sugars and 50% for AELA.  Therefore there would be 27 g glucose, 9 g xylose, 9 g other sugars, and 25 g  AELA.    The post pretreatment quantitative saccharification result would show glucose remaining divided by  the total remaining.  This would be 27 / (27 + 9 + 9 + 25)   38.571 %    For this example, let the post enzyme HPLC analysis be 15 mg / ml glucose, the dry amount of material  added 1000 mg, and the total volume 20 ml.    Enzyme saccharification results would then be  15   20 / 1000   38.571 %   77.78%    Overall yield for glucose after one week would be 77.78 %   90 %  = 70.0 %.   (Enzyme saccharification yield   pretreatment yield).                                          56 

Adjusted Method     There are no quantitative saccharification results after the pretreatment so an approximation is used for  the pretreatment yields.  In this case, Table 5.1 would contain the values of 90, 90, 90, and 50 for  glucose, xylose, other sugars and AELA respectively, in the week one column of the 55 °C row)    Initial proportions would be the same and the enzyme saccharification results would be the same.    Using Equation 5.7 solve for glucose conversion,  

      
                  Therefore by Equation 5.6, the overall yield is 15 (GHPLC)  = 70 %.                                           20 (VES) / 1000 (MB)   0.42857 (GCON)          30 / [ (30 x 0.9) + (10 x 0.9) + (10 x 0.9 ) + (50 x 0.5)         0.42857

Experimental setup procedure 

1. For each sample, a Ziplock tuperware container with soft plastic top (malleable), was drilled with  nine, 4/16" holes around the inside edges and in the center, as shown in Figure 5.2.   

  Figure 5.2 Lime sample container. 

Nine 5/16" outside diameter clear vinyl tubes CT series "K0010" were pushed into the holes,  until the resting position was at approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the container.  These  lines were attached to an 8 spigot plastic manifold.  The extra line was used as a vent.    2. 80 g of dried biomass was added to the container, along with 40 g of lime, and 800 ml of DDW.    3. The sample was stirred until well mixed, and the pH measured to ensure it was approximately  12.    4. Samples were placed  in water baths set to 55, 65, and 75 °C.  The plastic manifolds were  attached to bottles with hard plastic screw caps, containing a slurry of lime and DDW (pH    12).  The connecting tubing was 7/16" OD and inserted through 6/16" holes drilled in the screw  caps. (Figure 5.3)    5. The lines leaving the lime slurry bottles passed through holes drilled in insullated styrofoam that  raised the level of the water bath lid. (Figure 5.3)

6. The lines leaving the water baths were connected to a central manifold which was connected to  a 5 L lime slurry housed in an Armstrong Anaerobic Digester (for CO2 scrubbing), equipped with  a heating blanked and set to 50 °C as shown in Figure 5.4.       

  Figure 5.4 Lime sample compressed air manifold and CO2 scrubber.   

 

The purpose of preheating and scrubbing the CO2 from the compressed air through the heated  lime slurries, was to ensure the temperature of the pretreatment remained at the desired 

60 

temperature set by the water bath, and to prevent the CO2 from reacting with, and consuming,  the lime in the samples.        7. The CO2 scrubber was attached to a Rigid, 10 L air compressor with regulator, as shown in Figure  5.5.

Water baths were filled with water and set to desired heat.  Heat was set on CO2 scrubber to 50 °C.  The compressor was turned on with regulator closed, and slowly adjusted upward until all  samples were bubbling rapidly (too fast to count).  Lime slurry levels in water baths were checked every 24 hours and replaced when necessary.  pH of CO2 scrubber was checked weekly to ensure pH remained approximately 12.  Samples were removed weekly, and mixed well before drawing off 150 ml for testing.  The 150 ml removed were poured into a settling column, and rinsed with DDW.  The solids were allowed to settle, and the supernatant poured off.  The slurry was adjusted to a pH of 7.0, using 5N HCl.  The solids were rinsed again in DDW repeatedly.  Each time the solids were allowed to settle,  and then the supernatant poured off.  The pH was checked and readjusted to 7.0.  Steps 11 and 12 were repeated until the slurry was   clear.  Figure 5.6 shows the progression from cloudy to clear.

13. From Week 3 on, pH was adjusted to 4.8 with 1M citric acid.  14. The slurry was mixed and the pH measured repeatedly until no change had occurred over a 12  hour period.  15. The sample was filtered through 0.45 µm Whatman filter paper and set on a tray to dry, as  shown in Figure 5.7.  The tray was placed in an oven at 44 °C or less, and left for 48 hours.

16. Dried samples were bagged in a marked Ziplock bag, and placed inside a larger Ziplock bag  marked with the weeks the samples were taken.   Samples were stored in the freezer until  needed for enzyme/quantitative saccharification.  17. A quantitative saccharification (Appendix 1) was performed on all samples to ascertain the post pretreatment glucose and xylose proportions. (Though the tests were not accurate)   18.  Total solids content was found by triplicate samples (Ratio of current mass to mass after 24  hours oven drying at 105 °C)  19. Enzymatic saccharification of material (Appendix 2) was performed to find the hydrolysis yield.  20. The alternative method as explained in Section 5.1, was used to estimate overall yield.

5.3 COSLIF pretreatment 
The method used for this paper was adapted from a study, Ehsanipour (2010), which confirmed the  effectiveness of the COSLIF method on SSO mixed with softwood.   The Ehsanipour (2010) study was in  itself adapted from Zhang et al. (2007), with changes made to some of the washing solvents (acetone to  ethanol), and varied acid hydrolysis times.  In the Ehsanipour (2010) study, a two hour optimum time  was found for the phosphoric acid portion of the treatment, and the overall conversion rate from  cellulose to glucose was found to be approximately 90 % at 60 FPU / g glucan cellulase loading. 

The method used for this study aimed to add precision to the overall yield figures, by finding both the  pretreatment yield and hydrolysis yield.  FPU loadings per gram glucan were varied to assess the  optimum loading for commercialization. 

  5.3.1 Apparatus, materials, and reagants  1. All equipment/reagents needed to perform the NREL laboratory analytical procedures for  cellulase assay, quantitative saccharification, and enzymatic saccharification as listed in  Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3.  2.

1. The mass of the bottles was recorded at room temperature. (A) 4.000 g of SSO mixture was  added to each weighed bottle.     2. 32ml of phosphoric acid (85%) was added to bottle.  3. Bottles were incubated in rotary shaker at 50 °C, 150 rpm, for 2 hours. 

63 

4. The phosphoric acid reaction was stopped by adding cool acetone (20 ml/g = 80 ml) and mixed  well by shaking.  5. Bottles were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min at 24 °C.  6. The supernatant was collected.  7. The pellet of solids was washed in approximately 160 ml of 95% pure ethanol and then  centrifuged at the same rate/time.    8. The supernatant was collected.  9. Steps 7 and 8 were repeated.  10. The pellet was then washed in 160 ml of DDW, centrifuged, and the supernatant collected, three  times.  11. The bottles were then dried at 45 °C for 48 hours, or until the change in mass was less than  0.05% in the space of 1 hour.  12. The mass was recorded at room temperature.  (B)  13. The dry material from bottle 1 was ground and mixed well using a pestle until there were no  clumps larger than 1 mm.  Three, 300 mg samples were taken from the ground material and  placed in dry 125 ml serum bottles.  The bottles were labeled sample 1.  14. Step 13 was repeated for bottles 2 through 10.  15. A quantitative saccharification was performed on the material in the serum bottles(Appendix 1).  16. A portion of the remaining material was split into ten, 1 g samples and dried at 105 °C for 24  hours.  Total solids were calculated for the 45 °C dried material.  (TS)  The average total  remaining material was found    >  (BA)*(TS).  17. The average moisture content, glucose concentrations from the quantitative saccharification,   and losses from pretreatment were used to calculate the amount of water needed to bring the  glucose concentration of samples to 20 g/L.  · Example  4.000 g of 100% dried material is found to be reduced to 2.000 g on average.   The average glucose content is 90.0% of the remaining material.  Therefore, if the  container and dried 4.000 g of sample weighed 124 g before pretreatment, and 134 g  after the rinses and centrifugation, there would be 10g of water.  Since there is 1.800  grams of glucose (0.900 * 2.000), 80 ml of DDW would need to be added to bring the  glucose content to 20 g/L.  (1.8 g / 0.09 L = 20 g/L)  18. Pretreatment yield was calculated from the ratio of glucose remaining in the bottle, to glucose  in original sample.      19. FOR SUBSEQUENT SAMPLES   Steps 111 were repeated.  20. An  enzymatic  hydrolysis  was  performed  on  the  material  as  per  the  method  described  in  Appendix 2.  21. Hydrolysis yield was calculated as per the method described in Appendix 2.    An overview of the process is shown in Figure 5.8.

6 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
6.1 Long term lime pretreatment results 
The results of the long term lime study are divided into three subsections.  The first subsection deals  with the effect the lime bond had in preventing quantitative saccharification testing, as well as inhibition  of enzyme hydrolysis.  The remaining sections present the overall yields achieved and a summary of the  results in comparison to similar long term lime studies.  6.1.1 Long term lime general findings 

As discussed previously in the methods section, the behavior exhibited by the treated material during  the washing procedure, post treatment quantitative saccharification, and enzyme hydrolysis, resulted in  low conversion yields.  The lime formed an unknown bond with the material/chemicals in the highly  heterogeneous mixed SSO and hardwood substrate.  This phenomenon was previously observed in   homogeneous corn stover (Kim, 2005) and poplar (Ramirez, 2005) feedstock studies, but not nearly to so  drastic an extent.   In those studies, the slurry was neutralized, centrifuged, and rinsed repeatedly until  the solution was clear.  Ramirez (2006) warned that, "It has been observed that no matter how carefully  the neutralization has been done, the pH increases again and further neutralization may be required."   In this study, a centrifuge of the size required was not available, therefore the solids were allowed to  settle in 1000 ml beakers before being tested for pH and readjusted.   The slurry had to be readjusted  dozens of times before it finally remained stable at a pH of 7.0.  There is no mention of this in the  previous studies, which would be unusual, given that it would take days/weeks just to allow for the  slurry to stabilize.  In addition, there is no mention in either the Ramirez (2006) or Kim (2005) study of a  necessary divergence from the NREL enzymatic or quantitative saccharification procedures that follow.   In this study, the quantitative saccharification appeared not to work even after the slurry had remained  at constant pH for over 24 hours.  The enzyme saccharification buffer solution required repeated  66 

readjustment back to a pH of 4.8.  It is possible that the lime formed a unique bond with the mixed SSO  and hardwood substrate that prevented proper hydrolysis.   Table 6.1 and Table 6.2 illustrate how the  lime interfered with proper quantitative saccharification.

AVERAGE  37.3 %

Since the lignin proportion of the original material was 25.1 %, and a large portion of the loss of mass in  the pretreated material should be from lignin, an increase in lignin content to 37 % is impossible.  Some  of the samples had 5060% lignin, as well as larger ash contents than the other samples, which could be  the higher amount of salts created by the lime and hydrochloric acid.    The results indicate that an  incomplete hydrolysis occurred.  The NREL, "Determination of Structural Carbohydrates and Lignin in  Biomass," stipulates in point 5.6 of the Interferences Section, "This procedure is not suitable for samples  containing added acid, base, or catalyst" (Sluiter et al., 2008).   Since the lime attachment to the biomass  appeared to increase with time, week 6 should have shown the most interference.    Table 6.2 shows the 

67 

quantitative saccharification results of week 6 of the 65 °C sample to outline the extent of the failed acid  hydrolysis.

AVERAGE 
 

14.4% 

 Since the glucan proportion started at 34 %, and should be getting larger as the treatment progresses,  14.4% shows that the quantitative saccharification results are that of an incomplete hydrolysis.   Since  quantitative saccharification is required to find both pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis yields,  neither of those yields could be calculated.  However, as explained in the methods section, an overall  yield was determined from the enzymatic results, and a pretreatment yield estimate, based on the corn  stover and poplar wood long term lime studies. 

As with the quantitative saccharification, behavior not reported in the other long term lime studies  occurred with the enzyme hydrolysis.   The enzyme hydrolysis of weeks one and two showed very little  sugar conversion.  In retrospect, the low conversion should not have been surprising, since the standard  method followed likely resulted in a rise in pH that inhibited the enzymes.   After the pretreatment  slurry was neutralized to a pH of 7.0, the solids were dried at 45 °C, and later added to a citrate buffer at  pH 4.8.   Since the enzyme hydrolysis does not conventionally call for a pH check of the buffer solution, 

68 

the probable rise was not detected.   Weeks one and two were retested and the pH rise discovered by  accident when half of the samples were left in the fridge overnight, to be simultaneously saccharified  with samples to be prepared the next day.  The pH was checked before addition of enzymes and the rise  from 4.8 to above 7 was discovered.  The samples were then adjusted back to 4.8, and repeatedly tested  until no noticeable change occurred by the end of a 12 hour period.  For samples from week 36, the  post treatment DDW/substate slurry was adjusted and readjusted by 1M citric acid until the slurry  remained steady for 12 hours at to a pH of 4.8.  The material was then filtered and dried before being  added to the 4.8 pH buffer solution.   All of the samples required additional adjustment after being  added to the buffer.   The fact that this was necessary, highlights the unique bond the lime has formed  with the mixed SSO and hardwood.   

 Compounding the need to repeatedly adjust the prehydrolysis liquor is the fact that the enzyme action  released more lime into solution, even after the buffered material was stable at a pH of 4.8.  The pH was  checked after 24 hours, and it was occasionally found even higher than 7.  Since the optimum pH range  of Accellerase 1500 enzyme is 4.6  5.0, and complete inactivation occurs at pH greater than 7,  (Genencor,http://www.genencor.com/wps/wcm/connect/09a976004fa2d4ceaecbbe4895e3224e/ACCE LLERASE+1500+product+information+sheet.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;amp;CACHEID=09a976004fa2d4ce aecbbe4895e3224e) the release of lime into the solution prevented proper enzyme hydrolysis.  In weeks  1 and 2, the pH was increased but remained below 6.0, and the material was not readjusted.  However,  in weeks 34, one adjustment back to a pH of 4.8 was necessary after 24 hours, accompanied by a  further addition of 15 FPU cellulase, as the pH was in some cases higher than 7.  In weeks 5 and 6, an  adjustment and additional enzyme were added to the samples at 24 and 48 hours, and the pH  nevertheless rose to levels that could inactivate the Accellerase 1500 enzyme.  At that point, no  additional enzyme was added.  Any pretreatment that required multiple enzyme addition to generate  sugars would not be cost effective.

Long term lime overall yields 

Figure 6.1, Figure 6.2, and Figure 6.3, show the overall conversions for glucose and xylose at the  different temperatures tested. 

  Figure 6.1  Overall lime treatment yield of glucose and xylose at 55 °C. 

 

70 

  Figure 6.2  Overall lime treatment yield of glucose and xylose at 65 °C. 

  Figure 6.3 Overall lime yield of glucose and xylose at 75 °C. 

The results are unlike similar studies, but consistent.  There was an initial rise in the glucose/xylose  release, then a leveling before plummeting to near zero glucose and very little xylose at week 4 or 5.  In  the corn stover and poplar wood studies, the conversion peaks were not achieved until week 4 (Kim, 

71 

2005; Ramirez, 2005).  The unknown lime bond allowed for release of lime into buffered and adjusted  enzyme hydrolysis liquor.  The pH increase to levels unsuited for enzymes is likely the cause of the low  conversion rates.   The effect that the lime had in bonding with the material seemed to happen faster at  75 °C, as it needed pH adjustment in week 2, while the 55 and 65 °C samples did not.  It is possible that  that is the reason the conversion rates at 75 ° C were even lower than at 65 °C.   At 55 °C, the test was  only conducted until week three, because the water bath broke down in the first week, and the sample  was then compromised.    

Given the lime release of the material during enzymatic hydrolysis, even if the conversion rates had  been above 80%, lime treatment of this material would not be commercially viable.  If more than one  dose of cellulase is needed at a loading rate as high as 15 FPU / g dry biomass, the process cannot be  commercially competitive with other pretreatment techniques.   In the following COSLIF pretreatment  section, a loading of 30 FPU / g glucan is shown to be commercially unacceptable at an overall  conversion rate of 89 %.  Since the lime treated biomass is about 50 % glucan, just one dose at 15 FPU /  g dry biomass is too expensive.  6.1.3 Long term lime pretreatment results summary 

The highest overall conversions from cellulose to glucose were found in the first week.  The amount of  glucose released, compared to the initial quantity in the biomass, was 38.5 %, 50.4 %, and 48.8 %, for  conditions of 55, 65, and 75 °C, respectively.   The highest xylose conversions took place in the first week  of treatment as well, for 55 and 75 °C, but for the 65 °C sample, the best conversion was in the fourth  week.  The percentage released in comparison to the initial quantity in the biomass was 38.5 %, 43.5 %,  and 44.1 %, for 55, 65 and 75 °C, respectively.  The Kim (2005) study found that 91.3 % and 51.8 %  overall glucose and xylose conversions were possible for corn stover at 55 °C, and that the peak overall  conversions occurred after 4 weeks.  The Ramirez (2005) study on poplar wood was only four weeks 

72 

long, but the best overall conversions were 80.7 % and 66.9% for glucose and xylose, in the fourth week,   at  65 °C.     Figure 6.4 shows the best results from this study compared to the corn stover and poplar  wood studies on long term lime treatment. 

  Figure 6.4  Sugar conversion efficiencies for this and other long term lime studies         corn stover (Kim, 2005)  poplar wood (Ramirez, 2005). 

The peak conversions found for this study on long term lime treatment of SSO mixed with forestry waste  (hardwood) were much lower than that found for similar biomass.  The peak conversions were found in  the first week in comparison to the fourth week for both the corn stover and poplar wood studies.  The  conversions might have been higher in this study in subsequent weeks, if the material had not released  lime into solution during enzyme hydrolysis.  This deficiency required repeated addition of enzymes and  pH adjustment.  The effect of pH adjustments was negated after the addition of more enzyme, because  it is likely that the enzyme action caused a subsequent further rise in pH.  Since the conversion  efficiencies were low in the first week, before multiple enzyme loadings would be necessary, long term  lime is not a viable pretreatment for SSO mixed with forestry waste.

6.2 COSLIF pretreatment results 
6.2.1 COSLIF pretreatment yield 

To find the pretreatment yield, ten bottles with 4.000 g (3.837 dry) of SSO/softwood were treated by the  COSLIF method, dried, weighed, and quantitatively saccharified to be analyzed by HPLC, in order to  ascertain the total mass and total glucose remaining.  The complete set of measurements and HPLC  absorbance readings can be found in Appendix 1, while the summary of findings are shown in Table 6.3  and Table 6.4.

The 66.3 % total mass remaining is larger in comparison to the Zhang et al. (2007) study, which found  that only 49.9 % of the corn stover survived the process.  Therefore, more lignin and hemicellulose are  carried through to hydrolysis.   The advantages of increased lignin and hemicellulose would be that  chemical lignin recovery would be less intensive, and a cofermentation of the xylose with the glucose 

74 

would yield more ethanol.   The disadvantage would be that lignin would increase the enzyme dosage  necessary.  Xylose was small enough in proportion to elute in the same peak as glucose on the HPLC, so  an estimate was made to subtract the portion beyond 13.56 minutes in the chromatogram results.  (13.5 minutes is the approximate time for xylose peak elusion, shown on the sample HPLC  chromatogram).  The subsequent hydrolysis analysis of this estimated xylose showed an average peak of  2.1 mg / ml in the 60 FPU / g glucan cellulase treated samples.  Since the total volume was 58.7 ml, and  the total dry biomass 2.543 g, the pretreated sample xylose composition is at least 4.8 % xylose (4.3 %  xylan).  This is approximately the same composition ratio as the biomass before pretreatment, therefore  about 66.3% of the xylose was left intact during pretreatment.    The Zhang et al. (2007) study on corn  stover showed that 21% of the xylose was passed on to the hydrolysis stage.  Therefore, if operating a  simple facility that was not selling the pretreatment solubilized hemicellulose separately, the revenue  from xylose fermentation would increase.  If the HPLC correction figures were too conservative, the  glucose conversion rates were even higher.  Bottle 6 and 7 are missing data in Table 6.3, because there  was an injection malfunction of all three of the triplicate quantitative saccharifacation samples in both  bottles. 

Table 6.4 shows the pretreatment yields from each bottle.  In some cases the yield was 100 % or above,  which is impossible.  The reason there are 100 % yields is that the initial glucose levels are taken from  the average initial quantitative saccharification.  With 95% confidence, the samples should be 29.3 %  2.9% glucan.  Therefore some of the samples would have had more glucose to start, and some would  have had less.

The average yield, shown in Table 6.4, is comparable with the Zhang et al. (2007) study done on corn  stover, which had a 92.9 % yield.  Since less material was solubilized than in the Zhang et al. study, it  follows that less glucose would be solubilized as well.    6.2.2 COSLIF enzyme hydrolysis to determine optimal loading 

An enzyme hydrolysis at 50 °C was performed under different cellulase loadings to ascertain the most  cost effective result.  That result was then experimented with at temperatures more suitable to  simultaneous fermentation with Z. Mobilis, strain 8b.  As mentioned in the Methods Section, the  samples were at first adjusted by approximation to 20 g/L for hydrolysis, because HPLC machine failure  delayed the quantification of pretreatment composition results.  The loadings were therefore also an  approximation of 10, 15, 30, and 60 FPU per g glucan.  The actual loadings after back calculation (Table  A27, Appendix 2) were 9.74, 14.61, 29.22, and 58.44 FPU per g glucan.  Those loadings will henceforth 

76 

be referred to as 10, 15, 30, and 60 FPU.  The loading 9.74 was carried over to the temperature range  section as well, but also referred to as 10 FPU.    

 Figure 6.5 shows the glucose digestibility (% conversion from pretreated sample total glucose) for the  50 °C samples at different cellulase loadings.

The lower loadings achieved over 90 % digestibility.  The near identical results between 10 and 15 FPU  could be a result of lower initial glucose in the 15 FPU samples, but if this is true all three samples were  equally low at 18.896, 18.691, and 18.535 g of glucose released.  The lowest reading is within 2% of the  highest.  More likely, there was little difference between the effects of the two loadings on this material.     Kaar et al. (2002) had similar findings with lime treated corn stover, as the 10 and 15 FPU loading 

78 

conversions were virtually the same at 50 °C, and the 10 FPU loading conversion at 40 °C  was actually  higher.   There are a number of studies that show very little (<5%) difference between 15 and 60 FPU  loadings at peak conversion (Teymouri et al., 2005; Wyman et al., 2005; Mosier et al., 2005), which  could explain the even results for 30 and 60 FPU loadings.    

As mentioned in Section 6.2.1, a rough estimate for xylose was made from correction of the glucose  chromatograms, the results of which can be found in APPENDIX 2.  The results showed that xylose  ranged from approximately 1.7 to 2.0 g/L in the 49.98 ml hydrolysate (at 24 hours).  The xylose  concentrations indicate that about 2.2 % and 2.6 % of the total 5.0 % original xylose survived the process  and were hydrolyzed by the enzymes.  In comparison, the Zhang et al. (2007) COSLIF study found that  only 1.9 % of the original 20% xylose survived to be hydrolyzed.    Therefore, while the softwood lignin  structure inhibits greater conversion of glucose, it does help to prevent dissolution of the hemicellulose,  which would increase the overall ethanol fermentation.  Again, as mentioned in Section 6.2.1, if the  glucose was corrected too conservatively, then the glucose yield rates are slightly higher, and the xylose  levels slightly lower.    The most remarkable result found by the Zhang et al. (2007) COSLIF study, and confirmed in these  experiments on a mixed SSO/softwood substrate, is the rate at which the sugars are digested.    The  peaks in this study were arrived at between 12 and 24 hours.  The Zhang et al. (2007) COSLIF study  found similar results in that all substrates had peaks achieved by 24 hours, and the 12 hour conversion  rates were at least 97 % of the peak.  If the enzymes could perform at the same rate in a temperature  range acceptable to a partnered bacteria in a simultaneous saccharification system, the speed of the  fermentation would be limited only by the speed of the saccharolytic bacteria.   This presents a distinct  advantage over other pretreatments. If the majority of conversion is achieved in only 12 hours, it could  mean at least a halving of the simultaneous fermentation time, allowing for double the output with the 

79 

same size tank.  (The literature review of numerous papers did not uncover a treatment that allowed 97  % of hydrolysis conversion within 24 hours). With a set amount of investment capital, the smaller  requirements for the fermentation tank would allow more money to be spent elsewhere, such as pre treatment and distillation capacity.  Larger capacity would result in more SSO processed and fermented.    

One disparity from the Zhang et al. (2007) COSLIF study that should be noted is the decline in glucose  after 1224 hours in all of the samples.  A possible conclusion for this phenomenon is that there was  microbial contamination despite precautions taken to prevent it.  The samples were not treated with  sodium azide to stop all microbial growth, as would be done in the NREL procedure for enzyme  hydrolysis, because the original intent was to use the hydrolysate for further fermentation studies.    Fortunately, the results for the best cost effective loading were not put in jeopardy by the assumption of  even the most disparate effects of microbes between samples.  The proof of the previous statement will  be shown in Table 6.6.  Table 6.5 through Table 6.7 show how the optimal cellulase loading was arrived  at given the price of ethanol, conversion efficiencies, and price of cellulase.  Table 6.5 shows the profit  difference between cost and revenue at different enzyme loadings.  The revenue is earned from ethanol  generated from the fermented hydrolysis sugars at a specific loading.   The cost is the cost of enzyme at  that specific loading.  Both revenue and cost are expressed on a per kg glucan basis.  For every kilogram  of glucan added to a hydrolysis digester, that amount of profit would be made from the hydrolysis.    Table 6.5 is shown in excel format, with a letter heading above each item.  If an equation is needed to  generate an item in the table, the equation is shown in the letter heading.  

 Example    Q = N/L,   Q is the L of cellulase / kg glucan, N is the cellulase loading in FPU / g glucan, and  L is the activity of the cellulase in FPU / ml.  Therefore the L of cellulase needed per kg glucan added to  the hydrolysis is the cellulase loading divided by the cellulase activity.

The following points provide an explanation for some of the items in Table 6.5:  · Z. mobilis is the fermentation organism to be used for subsequent studies associated with this  project.  Z.  mobilis is capable of fermenting 1.0 grams of glucose to 0.5 g of ethanol (Zhang,  2003)  · Since ethanol has a density of 0.789 kg / L, Z. mobilis can ferment 1.0 kg of glucose to 0.634 L of  ethanol, which is 0.167 gallons.  · The anhydrous correction for glucose to glucan is 0.9.  Therefore Z. mobilis can ferment 1.0 kg of  glucan to 0.186 gallons of ethanol (0.167/0.9 = 0.186)  · Pretreatment yield  is taken from Section 6.2.1  · The $ 2.00 delivered cost of Accellerase Duet cellulase enzyme was quoted by Aaron Kelly,  Senior Manager Business Development, Genencor, May 4th, 2010.    · This study used Accellerase 1500 for testing because Accellerase Duet is only available by tonne  or tanker.   Genencor claims that Accellerase Duet has an activity level that is 3 times that of  Accellerase1500(Genencor,http://www.genencor.com/wps/wcm/connect/genencor/genencor /products_and_services/business_development/biorefineries/accellerase/accellerase_product _line/accellerase_product_line_en.htm).  Since activity is measured in units / ml, the volume of  Accellerase Duet enzyme needed to accomplish the Accellerase 1500 lab results would be one  third that of the Accellerase 1500 volume used.    · The mass of 10 ml of enzyme was measured to be 10.220 g.  Therefore, the density is             1.022 kg / L.  · The price of ethanol was assumed to be $ 2.00, a price well under what ethanol futures are  trading for until past 2012 (Barchart.com).   This figure is used   · Enzyme hydrolysis yields can be seen in Figure 6.5, or taken from Appendix 2.  · The overall yield is the pretreatment yield multiplied by the hydrolysis yield.  · The revenue from the addition of 1.0 kg of glucan to the enzyme digester is the overall yield of  glucose, multiplied by Z. mobilis conversion of that kg of glucan to ethanol, multiplied by the  price of ethanol.  · The cost associated with converting that added kg of glucan is the price of a kg of enzyme,  multipled by the estimated litres of enzyme added, multiplied by the density of the enzyme.   

Table 6.5 shows the profit regimes for different loadings of the 50 °C enzyme hydrolysis research results.   Since the 10 and 15 FPU loadings had the same conversion rate, the cheaper option is to use 10 FPU.    The jump to achieve higher conversion at 30 FPU is not rewarded by better profit, since the cost of the  enzyme per kg glucan converted outweighs the additional ethanol generated.

COSLIF enzyme loading maximization sensitivity analysis   

If the argument is made that microbial contamination could have disproportionally affected the 15 FPU  loading over the 10 FPU loading, even though the total drop in sugars appears larger in the 10 FPU  samples, the conversion rates can be altered to be more conservative toward the conclusion.   Table 6.6  on the following page shows the final conversion results needed to make the 15 FPU loading equal to 10  FPU, and what the price difference would be if 30 and 60 FPU loadings had 100 % hydrolysis, possibly  taken away by the microbes (All other components held constant).

The loadings of 30 and 60 FPU remain far more expensive, while 15 FPU would require a 95.6 %  hydrolysis yield to be more cost effective than 10 FPU; a yield far above that recorded for softwood in  the Zhang et al. study at the same enzyme loading.  Table 6.7 shows the effects of adding the real price  of current ethanol futures through to 2011 (Barchart.com), or the results obtained if Accellerase Duet  performs at an activity level less than advertised (Holding all other components constant).  The profit  margin between 10 FPU and all of the other loadings, widens dramatically.

  Figure 6.6 Sensitivity analysis summary  increased profit from 10 FPU loading over 15, 30, and 60 FPU.  6.2.4 COSLIF enzyme hydrolysis to determine optimum temperature 

Enzyme action was tested at 30, 35, and 40 °C  to ascertain the fall in activity, in order to assess the  proper temperature to pair the enzyme with Zymomonas mobilis, a rapidly saccharolytic bacteria  capable of fermenting glucose as well as xylose.   If a simultaneous saccharification and co fermentation  (SSCF) is to be effective, a temperature balance between the organism's ideal temperature and the  enzyme action has to be struck.  Cazetta et al. (2007) found that Z. mobilis is more effective at 30 °C than  35 or 40 °C.  Zhang et al. (2003) found Z. mobilis capable of fermenting 37 g / L glucose and 37 g / L  xylose to completion in 12 hours and 24 hours respectively at 30 °C.  When the bug was inhibited by  acetate and a higher temperature of 37 °C, Z. mobilis strain 8b was still capable of fermenting to  completion in 24 hours. 

Since the majority of sugar in a COSLIF treated material is glucose, if the enzyme action was near  completion in only 12 hours at 30 °C, like it was at 50 °C, then the SSCF process would be extraordinarily  quick.  Unfortunately, that was not the case for the results in this study.  Figure 6.7 shows the enzyme  hydrolysis profile at 30 °C. 

85 

 

  Figure 6.7 COSLIF enzyme hydrolysis profile at 30 °C.  The total glucose achieved by 72 hours was less than that of the 50 °C samples, and the rate of  hydrolysis far slower.  In fact, it is likely that peak had not yet been reached, as no plateau is evident  from the results. 

At 40 °C however, the enzyme action appears to be only slightly slowed, with the peak conversion  achieved between 12 and 24 hours, and the conversion at 12 hours 91 % of that found in the 50 °C  study.  Figure 6.8 shows the 40 °C hydrolysis profile. 

  Figure 6.8 COSLIF enzyme hydrolysis profile at 40 °C. 

86 

Consequently, the 35 °C samples were expected to be a possible midground between the near perfect  enzyme action at 40 °C, and the optimum bacterial condition of 30 °C.  For all of the temperature range  bottles, a 48 hour sample was taken to be tested if needed, to better determine the hydrolysis plateau.   These 48 hour samples were analyzed for the 35 °C range, as the 24 hour figures were not near the  peak.  Since the lowest FPU loading was the best in the economic optimization tests, a lower loading of 5  FPU was added to the 35 °C testing as well.  Figure 6.9 shows the 35 °C hydrolysis profile. 

  Figure 6.9 COSLIF enzyme hydrolysis profile at 35 °C. 

The 5 FPU loading resulted in a 24 % drop in digestibility by 24 hours.  With the high level of lignin in the  SSO/softwood substrate, it was no surprise that enzyme loadings could only be dropped so far.   Sharma  et al. (2002) found as much as a 2 fold increase in sugar release from 5 to 10 FPU loadings when treating  steam exploded sunflower stalks.   From the 35 °C profile, it was also obvious that this temperature  condition is much less effective than 40 °C at 24 hours.   In looking at the HPLC chromatograms for 35 °C,  a trend can be seen that does not exist in the 40 °C samples.   On the 12 and 24 hour profiles as shown 

87 

in Figure 6.9 and Figure 6.10, there is a disproportionate amount of cellobiose (10.6 min peak), to that  of the 48 and 72 hour images (Figure 6.11 and Figure 6.12), as well as in comparison to the 12 hour   40 °C chromatogram (Figure 6.13).  It is possible that the lower temperature is disproportionately  slowing the glucosidase enzyme in the Accellerase 1500 enzyme cocktail, which would slow the  conversion of cellobiose to glucose.

Regardless of the reasoning behind the slower cellobiose/glucose conversion at 35 °C, since Z. mobilis  functions to ferment within 24 hours at 37 °C, the ideal temperature for an SSCF system will be between  37 and 40 °C.  The ideal loading for that system will be approximately 10 FPU / g glucan. 

The 10 FPU / g glucan loading was checked against the claim Genencor has made that, "Accellerase  DUET puts you facetoface with a startling economic threshold: 50 cents enzyme cost per gallon of  ethanol."(Genencor,http://www.genencor.com/wps/wcm/connect/genencor/genencor/products_and_ services/business_development/biorefineries/accellerase/accellerase_product_line/accellerase_produc t_line_en.htm)  From the values calculated in Table 6.5, Z. mobilis can ferment 1 kg of glucan to  approximately 0.186 gallons of ethanol.  If the overall conversion of a 10 FPU loading at 40 °C is  considered, then 0.151 gallons would be fermented from 1 kg glucan added to the fermentor (0.186 x  0.81)  Table A23 (Appendix 2) shows there is a little more than 0.1 g xylose / g glucose released.  This  would increase the total ethanol to approximately   0.151 + 0.015 = 0.166 gallons, per kg glucan added,  since xylose utilization is approximately the same as glucose (Zhang, 2003).  Therefore it would require  1/0.661 = 6.024 kg of glucan to generate a gallon of ethanol.  The enzyme cost per kg of glucan at 10  FPU is $ 0.096 (Table 6.3).  The actual loading was in fact 9.74 FPU (Table A27, Appendix 2), which  would make the actual cost approximately $0.093 / kg glucan.  Therefore, the total cost in enzyme to  convert a 6.024 kg of glucan to 1 gallon of ethanol would be approximately $ 0.56, which is indeed very  close to the Genencor claim.  6.2.5 COSLIF pretreatment results summary 

The pretreatment glucose yield was found to be 93.7 %.  The highest enzyme hydrolysis yield found was  93.5 % for a loading of 30 FPU/ g glucan at 50 °C.  These yields combined represent an overall yield of  87.6 %.  The best hydrolysis yield found at lower loading (10 FPU / g glucan), was 83.5 %.   The overall  yield was 78.2 %.  This is comparable to the 77 % yield found in the Soderstom et al. study (2003), on 

91 

dilute acid treatment of softwood, which had a much higher loading of 15 FPU cellulase / g dry biomass  + 23 IU glucosidase / g dry biomass. Both the pretreatment yield and the hydrolysis yield are similar to  those found in the COSLIF study done by Zhang et al. (2007), using a loading of 15 FPU cellulase / g  glucan + 60 IU/g glucan glucosidase.  The Zhang et al. (2007) study found pretreatment and hydrolysis  yields of 92.9 % and 97.0% for corn stover.   The hydrolysis yield was 75.0 % for softwood.   Figure 6.14,  summarizes the comparisons to those studies with the results of this experiment.

   Figure 6.14  COSLIF pretreatment results comparison (A),             COSLIF and dilute acid results comparison for overall yield (B).      The higher pretreatment yield for mixed SSO and softwood, to that reported for corn stover, is as would  be expected with a higher lignin content to protect the material from degradation.   Consequently,  higher lignin content is a reason to expect a less effective hydrolysis in comparison to corn stover, as  was found in both this study and the Zhang et al. (2007) figures for softwood.     

At a higher loading of 30 FPU / g glucan, the 87.6 % overall yield is very close to the approximate yield of  89.5% found for a loading of 60 FPU / g glucan in the previous COSLIF study, completed as a part of this  project (Ehsanipour, 2010).   

In terms of enzyme cost maximization, the lowest (10 FPU) loading tested was found to be the most cost  effective, based on current ethanol and cellulase pricing.   A drop in temperature slowed the rate of  enzyme action but did not affect the overall conversion, except for the 30 °C samples.  In fact, the peak  conversion rate was slightly higher for 35 °C than for 40 °C, though it took longer to reach the peak.  The  same phenomenon of higher conversion rates after time for lower temperature, was found in a study on 

93 

lime treated corn stover by Kaar et al. (2000) when studying the difference between 40 and    50 °C on  enzyme action.      The 40 °C enzyme hydrolysis peaked between 12 and 24 hours, while the 35 °C hydrolysis peaked at 72  hours.  Since the bacteria of interest for this project, Zymomonas mobilis 8b, has been shown to ferment  large quantities of sugar to ethanol within 24 hours at 37 °C, (Zhang, 2003), the best temperature for a  simultaneous saccharification and fermentation would likely be between 37 °C and 40 °C.

7 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
This study assessed two pretreatments for their effectiveness to prepare SSO mixed with wood waste  for enzymatic hydrolysis, and compared them to other pretreatment techniques.  SSO and forestry  waste (hardwood) was treated by the long term lime method, and SSO and demolition waste (softwood)  by the COSLIF method.   

7.1 Conclusions 
Conclusions about the effectiveness of both lime and COSLIF treatments for the mixed SSO wood waste  are as follows: 

1. Long term lime treatment is not an effective pretreatment for SSO and forestry waste.   The  need for multiple additions of cellulase, that are made inactive by lime release even after post  treatment stabilization, indicates that the cost of the treatment would be prohibitive.   2. COSLIF is an effective treatment for SSO and demolition waste (softwood).   Even at a lower  loading (10 FPU), than a similar study on softwood (15 FPU + cellobiase, Zhang et al., 2007), the  glucose release was higher.    3. Since the conversion rates for COSLIF treated SSO and softwood were high, there is a high  degree of certainty that SSO and a mixture of almost any organic material would achieve high  conversion rates as well.  Softwood has extremely high lignin content and has been found  previously by Zhang et al. (2007) to be far less amenable to COSLIF treatment than corn stover,  poplar wood, or switchgrass.   4. COSLIF is a good pretreatment for SSO mixed with demolition waste in terms of the rate of  enzyme hydrolysis.  The rapid rate found in other studies was confirmed in this study on  SSO/softwood.  The ramifications of rapid hydrolysis are that a simultaneous saccharification 

95 

and fermentation system could operate much more quickly than systems employing other  pretreatments.  COSLIF treated SSO and softwood were fully hydrolyzed in approximately 12  hours, which means almost any mixed SSO biomass would be hydrolyzed in the same period.  All  other conditions being equal, this represents a doubling of capacity in the same size digester for  pretreatments showing a 24 hour time to reach near peak figures for enzyme hydrolysis.  Using  COSLIF instead of pretreatments requiring a 72 hour hydrolysis, 6 times more material could be  processed in the same size digester.  5. Lowering temperature slows the rate of hydrolysis for COSLIF treated SSO/softwood, but not  necessarily the overall yield.  The slower rate was barely noticeable at 40 °C, but pronounced at  35 °C.    6. Since the peak conversion was reached between 12 and 24 hours at 40 °C, but the largest  conversion was not found until 72 hours at 35 °C, the ideal temperature for a simultaneous  saccharification and fermentation with Z. mobilis 8b, will be between 37 °C and 40 °C.                  Z. mobilis, strain 8b, can ferment to completion at 37 °C within 24 hours (Zhang et al., 2003).  7. The ideal loading for most profit generated per kg glucan converted to ethanol, out of a range of  10, 15, 30 and 60 FPU, was 10 FPU.  The best loading was found using the price of ethanol  futures, as well as current costs of Genencor Accellerase brand enzymes.   The activity level ratio  of Accellerase Duet, to that of the Accellerase 1500 used in this study, is advertised as 3 to 1.  If  the price of ethanol used is more conservative at current prices, or the Accellerase Duet enzyme  is less active than advertised, the 10 FPU loading becomes even more profitable in relation to  the other loadings.  8. There was a significant (25%) drop in glucose conversion between 5 and 10 FPU loadings at 35°C  by the 12th and 24th hour marks.  Therefore, the ideal loading in the simultaneous 

96 

saccharification and fermentation at 37 to 40 °C, will be somewhere between 5 and 10 FPU,  likely closer to 10 FPU. 

7.2 Recommendations for future study 
The research results of this paper have shown that the COSLIF method can be effectively employed to  break down SSO mixed with demolition waste.  The enzyme hydrolysis was accomplished at a cellulase  loading of only 10 FPU per gram glucan in the treated biomass.  The hydrolysis rapidly reached a peak  between 12 and 24 hours, at 40 °C.  However, in light of the commercialization goals of this project,  more information is needed to confirm the efficacy of the COSLIF process in comparison to the  cheapest, and most effective pretreatment to date:  dilute acid.  Recommendations for testing that  would allow comparison of the COSLIF method to dilute acid pretreatment for commercialization are as  follows: 

1. A fermentation study of Z. mobilis utilizing the post COSLIF hydrolysis hydrolysate with addition  of 1% v/v corn steep liquor.  Corn steep liquor is the cheapest nutrient additive, and has already  been tested effective for Z. mobilis fermentation (Lawford and Rouseau, 1997).  Included in that  study would be fermentation of a broth of pure sugars, mirroring the concentrations found in  the COSLIF hydrolysate.  The pure sugar fermentation would allow for conclusions to be drawn  about the existence of possible fermentation inhibitors, caused by the COSLIF process.  2. A fermentation study of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), on the same hydrolysate if        Z. mobilis was found to be inhibited by the broth.  3. A simultaneous saccharification and fermentation study of the COSLIF pretreated material with  Z. mobilis, or yeast in the event that Z. mobilis is inhibited.  The fermentation would be a  continuous study started at a temperature of 40 °C, and kept there until output was stable.   Since results for the ideal temperature between 37 and 40 °C have not yet been found, the 

97 

temperature would be decreased by a degree at a time until 37 °C, establishing output stability  between drops, and recording the overall sugar and ethanol levels.  Once the ideal temperature  was reached, the cellulase loading could be lowered slowly until the decrease in ethanol, at a  conservative price, equaled the decreased cost in enzyme dosage.  The experimental conditions  could be repeated at different digester residence times, varying upwards from 12 hours until  peak ethanol conversions could be reached.   The greatest expected profit regime for the  fermentation/saccharification tank could be found from the above conditions given the cost  (size) of the tank, cost of cellulase, and revenue from ethanol.  These costs/revenues would be  quantified by combinations of residence time, cellulase loading, and ethanol yield.  4. Most importantly, the recycle efficiencies of the COSLIF process would have to be tested.   Whereas dilute acid treatment costs are well known and modeled, COSLIF has not been  employed at the commercial scale.  The commercialization of the COSLIF method relies on the  ease of recycle for the comparably far more expensive solvents.  The losses for each solvent  during a pass through the process would have to be calculated, as well as the saturation point of  the phosphoric acid, acetone, and ethanol.  Each time the solvents pass through the process,  some portion of the sugar, lignin, and other components in the biomass will be solubilized.   At  some point, these dissolved components will start to interfere with the efficiency of the  dissolution and/or precipitation of the biomass components.   After the limits of recycling  efficiency are found, cost comparisons of the two processes can begin to be made. 

Although the long term lime results were not encouraging, the process could be very well suited to a  pilot plant facility.   Consequently, further research into separating lime from mixed SSO long term lime  treated biomass could be valuable.   A washing process that removed the bonds between lime and  mixed SSO, without removing or degrading the fermentable sugars, could still prove long term lime an  ideal treatment process.

A1.1 Procedure for determination of structural carbohydrates and lignin in biomass 
The procedure is taken for the most part directly from the NREL, "Determination of Structural Carbohydrates and Lignin  in Biomass" Laboratory Analytical Procedure (LAP), Revised April 2008, Technical Report # NREL/TP51042618.

Materials 

1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.  

Glass serum bottles, 125 ml capacity, with septum and clamp seal.    Plastic stir rods sized to fit in serum bottle and extent at least 3 cm longer.    Ashless, 0.2 m Whatman filters.   Filtration flasks, 250 mL   Adjustable pipettor, 1.00 ml.    pH paper, range 111.  pH meter.  Disposable syringes, 3 mL, fitted with 0.2 syringe filters.  Autosampler vials.  

  Procedure      1. Weigh 300 mg of the sample prepared by the NREL Laboratory Analytical Procedure (LAP), "Preparation of  samples of Biomass Compositional Analysis" and add to serum bottle.  2. Before, after or during the test, add ten 1.000 g samples to some sort of heat resistant dish, and find the  moisture content by taking the difference in weight of the material after exposure to 105  3 °C for 24 hrs, or  until the change in weight is less than 0.1% over the space of one hour.  A minimum total solids for this  procedure is 85%.    3. Add 3.00 + 0.01 mL (or 4.92 + 0.01 g) of 72% sulfuric acid to serum bottle. Use a Plastic (acid resistant) stir rod to  mix for one minute, or until the sample is thoroughly mixed.   4. Place the bottle in a water bath set at 30 + 3 °C or equivalent system (pot and hot plate) and incubate the  sample for 60 + 5 minutes. Using the stir rod, stir the sample every five to ten minutes without removing the  sample from the bath. Stirring is essential to ensure even acid to particle contact and uniform hydrolysis.   5. Upon completion of the 60minute hydrolysis, remove the tubes from the water bath. Dilute the acid to a 4%  concentration by adding 84.00 + 0.04 mL deionized water using an automatic burette or scale. Dilution can also  be done by adding 84.00 + 0.04 g of purified water using a balance accurate to 0.01 g. Stopper the caps securely.  Mix the sample by inverting the tube several times to eliminate phase separation between high and low  concentration acid layers.       Analysis of Lignin      1. Vacuum filter the autoclaved hydrolysis solution through one of the previously weighed ashless filters. Capture  the filtrate in a filtering flask.   2. Use deionized water to wash all remaining solids out of the serum bottle into the filtering flask. Rinse the solids  with a minimum of 50 mL fresh deionized water   3. Dry the filter and acid insoluble residue at 105 + 3 °C until a constant weight is achieved, usually a minimum of  four hours.   4. Remove the samples from the oven and cool in a desiccator. Record the weight of the filter and dry residue to  the nearest 1 mg.   5. Place the crucibles and residue in the muffle furnace at 575 + 25 °C for 24 + 6 hours.   6. A furnace with temperature ramping may also be used Furnace Temperature Ramp Program:   · Ramp from room temperature to 105 °C   · Hold at 105°C for 12 minutes   · Ramp to 250 °C at 10°C / minute   · Hold at 250 °C for 30 minutes   106 

· Ramp to 575 °C at 20 °C / minute   · Hold at 575 °C for 180 minutes   · Allow temperature to drop to 105 °C   · Hold at 105 °C until samples are removed   7. Carefully remove the crucible from the furnace directly into a desiccator and cool. Weigh the filters and ash to  the nearest 1 mg and record the weight.       Analyze the sample for structural carbohydrates    1. Prepare a series of calibration standards containing the compounds that are to be quantified. Suggested range is  0.1 to 4.0 mg / ml.  Use a four point calibration. If standards are prepared outside of the suggested ranges, the  new range for these calibration curves must be validated.   2. A fresh set of standards is not required for every analysis. A large batch of standards may be produced, filtered  through 0.2 m filters into autosampler vials, sealed and labeled. The standards may be stored in a freezer and  removed when needed. Thaw and vortex frozen standards prior to use. During every use, standards should be  observed for unusual concentration behavior. Unusual concentrations may mean that the samples are  compromised or volatile components have been lost. Assuming sufficient volume, standards and CVS samples  should not have more than 12 injections drawn from a single vial. In a chilled autosampler chamber, the lifetime  of standards is approximately three to four days.   3. Using the hydrolysis liquor obtained in step 2 of the Lignin analysis procedure, transfer an approximately 20 mL  aliquot of each liquor to a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask.   4. Use calcium carbonate to neutralize each sample to pH 5 ­ 6. Avoid neutralizing to a pH greater that 6 by  monitoring with pH paper. Add the calcium carbonate slowly after reaching a pH of 4. Swirl the sample  frequently. After reaching pH 5 ­ 6, stop calcium carbonate addition, allow the sample to settle, and decant off  the supernatant. The pH of the liquid after settling will be approximately 7. (Samples should never be allowed to  exceed a pH of 9, as this will result in a loss of sugars.) After reaching a pH of 4, the sample can alternatively be  swirled around a set pH meter probe and adjusted slowly.  5. Prepare the sample for HPLC analysis by passing the decanted liquid through a 0.2 m filter into an autosampler  vial. Seal and label the vial. If necessary, neutralized samples may be stored in the refrigerator for three or four  days. After this time, the samples should be considered compromised due to potential microbial growth. After  cold storage, check the samples for the presence of a precipitate. Samples containing a precipitate should be  refiltered, while still cold, through a 0.2 m filters.   6. Analyze the calibration standards and samples by HPLC using a Shodex sugar SP0810 or Biorad Aminex HPX87P  column equipped with the appropriate guard column.   7. HPLC conditions:   8. Injection volume: 10 ­ 50 L, dependent on concentration and detector limits   9. Mobile phase: HPLC grade water, 0.2 m filtered and degassed   10. Flow rate: 0.6 mL / minute   11.

Note: The deashing guard column should be placed outside of the heating unit and kept at ambient  temperature. This will prevent artifact peaks in the chromatogram.   16. Check test sample chromatograms for presence of cellobiose and oligomeric sugars. Levels of cellobiose greater  than 3 mg/mL indicate incomplete hydrolysis. Fresh samples should be hydrolyzed and analyzed.   17. Check test sample chromatograms for the presence of peaks eluting before cellobiose (retention time of 45  minutes using recommended conditions). These peaks may indicate high levels of sugar degradations products  in the previous sample, which is indicative of over hydrolysis. All samples from batches showing evidence of  overhydrolysis should have fresh samples hydrolyzed and analyzed.     107 

    Calculations      1. Calculate the oven dry weight (ODW) of the extractives free sample, using the average total solids content as  determined by the LAP "Standard Method for the Determination of Total Solids in Biomass".     ODW =   

  2. Calculate and record the weight percent acid insoluble residue (AIR) and acid insoluble lignin (AIL) on an  extractives free basis.    % AIR =      % AIL =   

   

    3. Create a calibration curve for each analyte to be quantified using linear regression. From these curves,  determine the concentration in mg/mL of each component present in the samples analyzed by HPLC, correcting  for dilution if required.     4. Calculate the concentration of the polymeric sugars from the concentration of the corresponding monomeric  sugars, using an anhydro correction of 0.88 (or 132/150) for C5 sugars (xylose and arabinose) and a correction  of 0.90 (or162/180) for C6 sugars (glucose, galactose, and mannose)  

  Canhydro = CHPLC x Anhydro Correction    5. % Sugar =     Volume filtrate = 87 ml

APPENDIX 2  Enzymatic saccharification 
The procedure used was adapted from the NREL, "Enzymatic Saccharification of Lignocellulosic Biomass"  Laboratory  Analytical Procedure (LAP), Revised March 2008, Technical Report #    NREL/TP51042629.  (Selig et al., 2008)    Terminology    1. Pretreated biomass: biomass that has been chemically or thermally altered, changing the      structural composition.  2. Cellulase enzyme: an enzyme preparation exhibiting all three synergistic cellulolytic activities:                    endo 1,4Dglucanase, exo1,4glucosidase, and Dglucosidase activities, which are        present  to different  extents in different cellulose preparations.   3. TS  % Total Solids    Apparatus        1. A suitable shaking or static incubator set at  50 °C  ± 1 °C  2. Any fixed speed rotator that can hold scintillation vials and operate in a static incubator.   3. pH meter.  4. Analytical Balance accurate to 1 mg.  5. HPLC equipped with a Refractive Index Detector  6. Biorad Aminex HPX87P column  7. 100 µL and a 1000 µL Eppendorf Pipetman pipet with tips.  8.  HPLC testing vials, 2 ml centrifuge vials, and 20 ml glass scintillation vials.      Reagants    6. Sodium Azide (20 mg/ml in DDW)  7. Sodium Citrate Buffer (0.05 M, pH 4.8)  8. 1M citric acid solution.  9. Cellulase of known activity, FPU/ml (APPENDIX 3)  10. 1N Ammonium Hydroxide (COSLIF ONLY)

A2.1 Procedure for lime pretreated  material 
  1. Weigh out 0.750 g of dried, pretreated material and add to each vial.  Four vials for each point to be tested, one  vial to be used as a blank.  2. Add 150 µL of 2% sodium azide reagent, as well as 14.7 ml of DDW, less the total ml cellulase enzyme to be  added to achieve 15 FPU loading.  3. Check that the pH remains 4.8 for at least 12 consecutive hours.  Adjust any changes back to pH 4.8 with 1M  citric acid.  4. Record total ml of citric acid used to adjust.  5. Bring each vial to 50 C by warming in the incubator.  6. Prepare an equal volume enzyme blank with buffer solution and bring to 50 C as well.  7. Innoculate all samples with 15 FPU / g dry biomass.    (For this experiment the activity = 41 FPU/ml.   Therefore 15/41*0.750  = 0.274 ml)  8. Close vials tightly and place on rotary shaker at 180 rpm (enough to keep solids in suspension)  9. Check vials for pH at 24 and 48 hrs.  Adjust if necessary and record adjustment + any additional enzyme added.  10. At desired intervals or completion (In this case 72 hrs) remove samples from incubator and draw 1.5 ml into a 3  ml syringe.  Transfer contents of syringe to 2 ml centrifuge vial and store in freezer for testing.  11. Before HPLC testing, thaw vials at room temperature and centrifuge at 15000 rpm for 10 min.    12. Draw liquid portion of vial into syringe and attach a 0.2 µm filter tip.  Plunge contents through filter to an HPLC  sampling vial.      Calculations    1. Calculate the glucose/xylose concentration in mg/ml  from  the sample supernatant by comparison to prepared  standards.  Subtract glucose concentrations, if any, from the substrate and enzyme blanks.    2. Calculate % digestion.

A2.2    Procedure for COSLIF treated material 
A2.2.1  Normal procedure which was used in the temperature effects testing  1. Weight bottle after Step 11 in COSLIF Procedure.  Calculate DDW in bottle (Mass bottle after pretreatment  ­  mass bottle ­ average mass remaining from previous dried samples).  Adjust pretreated material in bottle to 20  g/L glucose using average value for glucose remaining in the bottle from the quantitative saccharification of the  pretreated material.  (APPENDIX 1)  Add 400 µL of 2% sodium azide and nearly but not all of the DDW.  Bring  bottles to desired temperature.  2. Adjust to pH 5.0 with 1N ammonium hydroxide.  3.  Add remaining DDW less the addition of desired ml of cellulase enzyme.  4. Add enzyme, seal bottles tightly and place on rotary shaker at 180 rpm (enough to keep solids in suspension).  5. Prepare enzyme blanks for each loading in bottles at same volume as samples.  Add a substrate blank bottle  with equal volume and no enzyme.  6. Take, store, and prepare samples in the same manner as described for the lime pretreated material.      Calculations    1. Calculate the glucose/xylose concentration in mg/ml  from  the sample supernatant by comparison to prepared  standards.  Subtract glucose concentrations, if any, from the substrate and enzyme blanks.    2. Calculate % digestion.   

% digestion = 

 

 
  A2.2.2   Procedure used for 50 C samples because HPLC was malfunctioning  At the time of  the 50 °C testing,  the quantitative saccharification results could not be found due to equipment  malfunction, and the glucose was approximated to 20 g/L by using the MBI International original glucan content results,  and assuming 100 % pretreatment yield.  This method was previously employed by fellow group member Mandana  Ehsanipour in her initial testing of the COSLIF.  The results were later corrected when the HPLC was functioning again.   The procedure is the same, replacing the pretreatment average glucose with the estimate.  The calculations are as  follows.

** I should note that this estimation contained an error in procedure.  51.4 ml of DDW would make 20 g/L glucan, not glucose.  It would actually be 22.222 g/L  glucose.  The actual glucose added in g/L had to be adjusted anyway when the real value was determined from quantitative saccharification so the error was  caught before subsequent analysis.  Table ? on the following page shows the calculations for the actual glucose in each sample, and the adjusted cellulase  loadings.

A2.4   Lime hydrolysis/overall yields 
As previously explained in the Methods Section, the hydrolysis yields were converted to overall yields by estimating the  change in compostion (% glucose and % xylose) of the pretreated material by comparison to previous long term lime  studies.  Table A27 below shows the summary of those composition assumptions.

APPENDIX 3 
A3.1   Procedure for the measurement of cellulase activity 
The procedure is taken almost exactly from the NREL, "Measurement of Cellulase Activity", Laboratory Analytical  Procedure (LAP), Revised January 2008, Technical Report # NREL/TP51042628.  (Adney and Baker, 2008)    Introduction  1. The  following  method  describes  a  procedure  for  measurement  of  cellulase  activity  using  International  Union  of  Pure  and  Applied  Chemistry  (IUPAC)  guidelines  (1).  The  procedure  has  been  designed  to  measure  cellulase  activity  in  terms  of  "filterpaper  units"  (FPU)  per  milliliter  of  original  (undiluted)  enzyme  solution.  For  quantitative  results  the  enzyme  preparations  must  be  compared  on  the  basis  of  significant  and  equal  conversion.  The  value  of  2.0  mg  of  reducing  sugar  as  glucose  from  50  mg  of  filter  paper  (4%  conversion)  in  60  minutes has been designated as the intercept for calculating filter paper cellulase units (FPU) by IUPAC.     2. It  is  extremely  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  FPU  is  defined  only  at  this  extent  of  conversion.  Reducing  sugar yield is not a linear function of the quantity of enzyme in the assay mixture; as discussed by Ghose (1987),  twice  the  amount  of  enzyme  would  not  be  expected  to  yield  twice  the  reducing  sugar  in  equal  time.  The  assay  procedure  therefore  involves  finding  a  dilution  of  the  original  enzyme  stock  such  that  a  0.5  mL  aliquot  of  the  dilution  will  catalyze  4%  conversion  in  60  minutes  (or,  in  practical  terms,  finding  two  dilutions  that  bracket  the  4%conversion  point  so  closely  that  the  required  dilution  can  be  obtained,  with  reasonable  accuracy,  by  interpolation)  and  then  calculating  the  activity  (in  FPU/mL)  of  the  original  stock  from  the  dilution  required.  Further comments on the required calculations, and their significance, are to be found in the Appendix.  

 
3. Assay mixtures may in some cases contain reducing sugars unrelated to hydrolysis of substrate glycosidic bonds  by the enzyme. Culture filtrates to be assayed for cellulase may contain nutrient sugars, and the reducing ends  of the cellulose polymers of the substrate may sometimes be measurable as glucose equivalents before any  enzyme attack. For this reason, controls consisting of (a) enzyme without substrate and b) substrate without  enzyme are included with all enzyme assays and sample values are corrected for any blank values.   

Apparatus 

1. Water bath capable of maintaining 50 °C   1°C. (Or alternatively as was used in this study, a pot with hot plate,  and rack for holding 15 ml centrifuge tubes.)  2. Spectrophotometer suitable for measuring absorbance at 540nm.          146 

Reagants and Materials 

1. DNS Reagent   Mix:     141.6 ml DDW               3,5 Dinitrosalicylic acid 1.06 g                                     Sodium hydroxide 1.98 g                  Dissolve above, then add:   Phenol (melt at 50oC) 0.76 mL                                                                Sodium metabisulfite 0.83 g               Rochelle Salts  30.6 (Added for COSLIF only)       

2. Citrate  Buffer:  For  Trichoderma  reesei,  cellulase  assays  are  carried  out  in  0.05  M  citrate  buffer  pH  4.8.  For  other  cellulase  enzymes,  the  pH  and  the  assay  temperature  may  be  different.  The  assay  conditions  must  be  defined  when reporting results.     Citric acid monohydrate 210 g   DI water 750 mL   NaOH  add until pH equals 4.3 50 to 60 g  

 
Dilute to 1 L and check pH. If necessary add NaOH until the pH is 4.5. When the 1 M stock citrate buffer stock is  diluted with water to 50 mM the pH should be 4.8. After diluting the citrate buffer check and adjust the pH if  necessary to pH 4.8.    Procedure  1. The  detection  of  glycosidic  bond  cleavage  by  this  method  involves  the  parallel  and  identical  treatment  of  three  categories  of  experimental  tubes  (assay  mixtures,  blanks  and  controls,  and  glucose  standards),  prepared  as  detailed below. The substrate is a 50 mg Whatman No. 1 filter paper strip (1.0 x 6.0 cm).   2. Enzyme assay tubes:   3. Place a rolled filter paper strip into each 13 x 100 test tube.  4. Add 1.0 mL 0.05 M Nacitrate, pH 4.8 to the tube; the buffer should saturate the filter paper strip.   5. Equilibrate tubes with buffer and substrate to 50oC.   6. Add  0.5  mL  enzyme  diluted  appropriately  in  citrate  buffer.  At  least  two  dilutions  must  be  made  of  each  enzyme  sample,  with  one  dilution  releasing  slightly  more  than  2.0  mg  of  glucose  (absolute  amount)  and  one  slightly  less  than  2.0  mg  of  glucose.  Target  2.1  and  1.9  mg  glucose,  respectively,  for  these  two  dilutions.  Depending  on  the  enzyme these targets may be hard to achieve and additional dilutions must be run.   7. Incubate at 50 C for exactly 60 min.   8. At  the  end  of  the  incubation  period,  remove  each  assay  tube  from  the  50  C  bath  and  stop  the  enzyme  reaction  by immediately adding 3.0 mL DNS reagent and mixing.  

   
9. Blank and controls:   Reagent blank: 1.5 mL citrate buffer.  

147 

Enzyme  control:  1.0  mL  citrate  buffer  +  0.5  mL  enzyme  dilution  (prepare  a  separate  control for each dilution tested).   Substrate control: 1.5 mL citrate buffer + filterpaper strip.   10. Glucose standards:   A  working  stock  solution  of  anhydrous  glucose  (10  mg/mL)  should  be  made  up.  Aliquots  of  this  working  stock  should  be  tightly  sealed  and  stored  frozen.  The  standard  should  be  vortexed  after  thawing  to  ensure  adequate mixing.   11. Dilutions are made from the working stock in the following manner:   1.0 mL + 0.5 mL buffer = 1:1.5 = 6.7 mg/mL (3.35 mg/0.5 mL).   1.0 mL + 1.0 mL buffer = 1:2 = 5 mg/mL (2.5 mg/0.5 mL).   1.0 mL + 2.0 mL buffer = 1:3 = 3.3 mg/mL (1.65 mg/0.5 mL).   1.0 mL + 4.0 mL buffer = 1:5 = 2 mg/mL (1.0 mg/0.5 mL).   12. Glucose standard tubes should be prepared by adding 0.5 mL of each of the above glucose dilutions to 1.0 mL of  citrate buffer in a 13 x 100 mm test tube.   13. Blanks,  controls  and  glucose  standards  should  be  incubated  at  50oC  along  with  the  enzyme  assay  tubes,  and  then "stopped" at the end of 60 minutes by addition of 3.0 mL of DNS reagent.   14. Color development (Miller, 1959):   a. Boil  all  tubes  for  exactly  5.0  minutes  in  a  vigorously  boiling  water  bath  containing  sufficient  water  to  cover  the  portions  of  the  tubes  occupied  by  the  reaction  mixture  plus  reagent.  All  samples,  controls,  blanks, and glucose standards should be boiled together. After boiling, transfer to a cold icewater bath.   b. Let the tubes sit until all the pulp has settled, or centrifuge briefly. Dilute all tubes (assays, blanks,  standards and controls) in water (0.200 mL of colordeveloped reaction mixture plus 2.5 mL of water in a  spectrophotometer cuvette works well, use the pipettor to mix by drawing the mixture into the pipettor  tip repeatedly). Determine color formation by measuring absorbance against the reagent blank at 540  nm. With this dilution the glucose standards described above should give absorbance in the range of 0.1  to 1.0 A.      Calculations 

1. Construct  a  linear  glucose  standard  curve  using  the  absolute  amounts  of  glucose  (mg/0.5  mL)  plotted  against  absorbance  at  540nm.  The  data  for  the  standard  curve  should  closely  fit  a  calculated  straight  line,  with  the  correlation  coefficient  for  this  straight  line  fit  being  very  near  to  one.  Verify  the  standard  curve  by  running  a  calibration  verification  standard,  an  independently  prepared  solution  of  containing  a  known  amount  of  glucose  which falls about midpoint on the standard curve.   2. Using  this  standard  curve  determine  the  amount  of  glucose  released  for  each  sample  tube  after  subtraction  of  enzyme blank.   3. Estimate  the  concentration  of  enzyme  which  would  have  released  exactly  2.0  mg  of  glucose  by  means  of  a  plot  of  glucose  liberated  against  the  logarithm  of  enzyme  concentration  To  find  the  required  enzyme  concentration  take  two  data  points  that  are  very  close  to  2.0  mg  and  draw  a  straight  line  between  them,  use  this  line  to  interpolate  between  the  two  points  to  find  the  enzyme  dilution  that  would  produce  exactly  2.0  mg  glucose  equivalents of reducing sugar.  

 
4. Calculate FPU:  

                                                   FPU =
