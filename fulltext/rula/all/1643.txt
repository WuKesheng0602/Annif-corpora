Abstract
Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album is an album published during the 1940's by

a Japanese marine product company. The album contains 52 gelatin-silver prints of a whaling expedition to the Antarctic Ocean and is a fascinating visual record of the Japanese whaling industry. Using this album as a case study, this thesis project is a study of the cataloguing process and preservation of a photographic album. The goal of this project is to make the album more accessible to researchers through translation, cataloguing and digitization, as well as to provide a preservation strategy through condition assessments. This paper summarizes the research conducted on the album, outlines the cataloguing process, the condition assessment of the album and provides a treatment proposal and a handling guideline for the album. The paper also includes a Romanization chart and a translation table of the album texts as aids for further research.

Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album: Cataloguing and Preservation of a Japanese Album

Introduction
This paper accompanies my thesis project of a case study in album preservation, which involves the cataloguing and preservation assessment of an album found in the collection of George Eastman House. This paper describes the process and methodology used in cataloguing and assessing the condition of the album, as well as summarizes and analyzes the information discovered through my research. My goals for the project are to learn various approaches to album preservation and to make this album more accessible to researchers. The album is a common form for assembling and organizing photographs. A wide range of albums can be found in any collection; some are valued as works of art and some are valued as sources of visual information. Even though the term "album" is often used as a generic term referring to any bound form of photographs, Gustavo Lozano has pointed out that there are distinctions between a photographically illustrated book
(photobook), which is a published book with photographic prints tipped in as illustrations,

and a photograph album, which is "a unique compilation of photographs assembled into a blank book by an individual or a group of persons. " 1 The main distinctions are "acquired vs. produced, public vs. private and multiple vs. unique. " 2 The object used in my research is a photographically illustrated book according to Lozano's defmition. However, I am using the term "album" to describe it, because the title includes the term "album," it is classified as an album in George Eastman House's collections management system, and it is preserved as a unique object in the photographic collection, rather than as a published book in the library collection.

Chapter 1: The Album- Its Content, Use and History
An Overview of the Album

The album used for this case study is a Japanese album published around 1941 by a Japanese marine product company that is still in business today. The company, which has asked to not be identified in this paper, is referred to here as "Company N".-The album is titled Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album
3

(accession number

2003: 1185:000 1-00052) and contains 52 gelatin silver prints that depict whaling activities and whaling vessels. It appears that the album was produced for the purpose of introducing the company's whaling business to related companies and stockholders, as well as the company's employees. The 52 photographs in this album, which are roughly in chronological order, follow the journey of whalers in great detail. The sequence of photographs can be divided into five sections: 1. From departure to fmding whales (2003: 1185:0002 - 0011) 2. Killing ofwhales (2003:1185:0012- 0028) 3. Dismemberment of whales (2003: 1185:0032- 0041) 4. Whaling vessels (2003:1185:0029- 0031 and 2003:1185:0042 - 0047) 5. Antarctic seascapes (2003: 1185:0048 - 0052) The frontispiece (2003: 1185:0001 ), which depicts a ship at sea, does not fit into the sequence. One sentence printed captions accompany each photograph, except for the frontispiece. These captions not only act as a narration to the photographs, transforming the album's otherwise grim subject into an exciting storybook, but also provide valuable information and useful clues for research. Although the focus of Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album is whaling, it also places emphasis on the whaling vessels. Almost one third of the 52 photographs in the album focus on whaling ships and there are seven vessels identified by name in captions, showing the importance of the vessels in whaling and making the album a valuable record of these vessels.

Historical Research: Establishing the Date Based on my historical research I believe Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album was published circa 1941. The company name and the slogan of "Syokuryo h6kok:u',4 written in calligraphy after the album's title page provide two clues to the publication date. Company N is a company that engages in fishery, aquaculture, sales and distribution of its marine products, including fresh and frozen fish, as well as frozen prepared foods. Since its foundation in 1911, The company has changed its name several times during its history and different names from the particular name used in this album were used prior to March 15, 1937 and during the time between March 31, 1943 and November 30, 1945, which places the publication date of the album to either between March 15, 1937 and March 31, 1943, or after December 1, 1945. 5 The slogan of "Syokuryo hokok:u," meaning "By food serving the country," was established as Company N's company motto as of January 1, 1941. 6 The inclusion of this slogan suggests a publishing date of 1941-1943 rather than after December 1, 1945. The company newsletter of Company N published on July 1, 1941 also mentions the expected completion date of the album7 later that month, 8 lending further evidence to a publication date of ca. 1941. The date for the photographs was determined as ca. 1940-1941 based on the whaling vessels identified in the photographs and e-mail correspondence with Company N. Among the seven identified vessels, the last one to join the Japanese whaling fleet in the Antarctic Ocean was a vessel purchased from England, which was first used in Antarctic whaling in 1939, 9 making that year the earliest possible date for these

photographs. The more specific date of 1940-1941 was later provided by Company N in e-ma1'1 correspondence 10 . The 1940/1941 expedition was the last whaling expedition before Japan fully engaged itself in the Second World War with the attack ofPearl Harbor. 11 Japan's mother ship style whaling in the Antarctic Ocean was suspended from 1941 to the season of 1946 due to the war. All vessels, both mother ships and whaling ships, depicted in this album were used as tankers and battle ships during the war and destroyed in battles between 1943 and 1944.

The Slogan of "Syokuryo Hokoku" and The Production of Whale Meat
The album begins with the company motto, "Syokuryo hokoku" (By food serve the country), written in calligraphy. This slogan was also used by the Japanese government during the Second Sino-Japanese War 12 for dealing with the shortage of food. With this slogan, the Japanese government began to urge people to conserve rice in 1939 and support its rationing system for food and daily items instituted by 1940. 13 It was also during this time that the Japanese government began to encourage the production of meat through the whaling industry, 14 hoping to ease the food shortage. In spite of the inclusion of the "Syokuryo hokoku" slogan in the album, the images in Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album do not emphasize the process of meat production, but rather offer a general view of whaling. Only nine out of the 52 photographs fall into the "dismemberment of whales" section (2003: 1185:032 - 0041 ), which is relevant to the production of meat and oil. In this section, there are references to oil production, such as the throat groove, sebum, born, the Hartmann boiler 15 and sperm

f Company N Public Relations Office, e-mail correspondence, March 10, 2008. Japan was already at war with China (The Second Sino-Japanese War). Western governments including the United States and the Britain tried to force Japan to withdraw from China by denying trade with Japan, which Japan took as an act of aggression and led to its declaration of war against the western countries. 12 The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between China and Japan before and during the Second World War. It began on July 7, 1937 with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and ended after Japan's surrender on September 9, 1945. 13 Oita Broadcasting System, "Kokka s6d6in ho: minna ga taeta donzoko seikatu" (National Mobilization Law: Enduring the life of poverty), Oita Broadcasting System, Inc., http://www.e-obs.com/heo/heodata/ n256.htm (accessed June 5, 2008). 14 Morikuni Itabashi, Nanpyoyo hogeishi (Tokyo: Chilo Koronsha, 1987), 97. 15 The Hartmann boiler is used for oil production.

whales, 16 but there is no clear reference to whale meat. The idea of"Syokuryo hokoku" is only referenced through one photograph of a ship (2003: 1185 :0045), accompanied by a caption mentioning the ship "strives to provide food for the service of country." This ship was a freezer ship used for the transportation of whale meat, but this is not mentioned in the album. The lack of emphasis on meat production in Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo
Album becomes more apparent when compared to other publications of the same subject. Nanpyoyo no Hogei (Whaling in Antarctic Ocean) published in 1950 by Iwanami Shoten

is another book with photographic illustrations that describe a whaling expedition to Antarctica. This small booklet of 64 pages presents the whaling expedition in a manner similar to Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album, including similar images of departure from the port, preparation works, shipboard entertainments and hunting activities. However, it shows more imagery related to meat production, including many close-up views of the butchered meat, the process of transporting the meat to the freezer and the fmal product of packaged whale meat. The book concludes with a photograph of a feast on the ship cerebrating the new record the expedition achieved in meat production. When compared to this booklet, Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album's use of the "Syokuryo hokoku" slogan seems more like propaganda or public relations than fact. The slogan seems to have been included to show the general attitude of Company N but does not reflect their whaling concerns. There is a general impression that Japanese whaling has always focused on meat production with oil production a secondary concern. However, the ratio of meat to oil production in Japanese whaling changes according to the needs of the society. 17 Although the Japanese have eaten whale meat throughout their history, it did not become a basic food item widely consumed by the population until after the Second World War. 18 Freezer ships for the transportation of whale meat were introduced in the 1939/1940 expedition, but the production of meat was still small in comparison to oil. From 1934 to
16

Sperm whales were hunted mostly for their oil, which produces the spermaceti oil, one of the most important whale oils. The meat of the sperm whales has a strong smell and is not suitable as food. 17 Hiroyuki Watanabe, A Historical Sociology of the Whaling Issue: Relationships between Whales and Human Beings in Modern Japan (Tokyo: Toshindo Publishing Co., Ltd., 2006), 56. 18 Prior to the war, whale meat was consumed only locally in areas with access to fresh whale meat due to the lack of technology to preserve and transport the meat.

1941, including the 194011941 expedition depicted in Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo

Album, the primary goal of Japanese whaling industry was still whale oil production
and it was not until 1946 that the production of meat became dominant.
20

19

This also helps

to explain why Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album, published ca. 1941, pays little attention to meat production in comparison to Nanpyoyo no Hogei, which was published in 1950.

The Use and Meaning of the Album

Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album was used to introduce whaling to related
businesses and employees of Company N, who probably had some knowledge of whaling already. The audience would be familiar with the company's vessels, the company motto and know that the main business of the company is food production. The inclusion of the "Syokuryo hokoku" slogan at the beginning of the album reinforces this idea of the company's mission. Whether or not the photographs actually depict food production was probably not a concern in the production of this album. The album is also a celebration of the heroic act of whaling in the Antarctic Ocean. In the devastating war period, the whaling industry was seen as a hope for the country, and whalers were honored as "industrial soldiers" who fought against the cold air and raging waves of the Antarctic Ocean. Many of the words and phrases used in the album captions not only convey a sense of heroism, but also have a military overtone to them. 21 For example, the word "sinpatu" used with the last photograph "Akatuki no sinpatu"22 (Embarkment at dawn. 2003: 1185 :0052) is a word used specially to describe

Katsuaki Morita, Kujira to hogei no bunkashi (Nagoya: Nagoya Daigaku Shuppankai, 1994), 353. The food shortage in Japan grew more severe after the Second World War and the lack of protein sources was especially a problem. The General Headquarters (GHQ), under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur, gave Japan permission to re-launch whaling in the Antarctic Ocean in 1946 in order to resolve the crisis. Several marine product companies embarked for the Antarctic Ocean using surviving tankers from the war refurbished as whaling vessels. The meat brought back from the expedition relieved the food crisis in Japan, and prompted the Japanese whaling industry to grow rapidly. 21 Whaling in Japan has always had military connections. It has been connected with the Marines because whaling ships were often constructed with the most advanced technology and later converted into military vessels. Whale oil was a raw material for explosives, and the money obtained from exporting the oil often became military funds. 22 "~0)~~~, in Japanese Kanji characters.

the retreat of military troops? 3 While promoting the company's business and the whaling industry with their nationalistic slogan, this album can be viewed as a response to the Second Sino-Japanese War, showing support for the country and cheering for the "soldiers" who labor in the service of their country.

Chapter 2: Cataloguing of the Album
Cataloguing is an important part of collections management, making a collection more accessible and contributing to its preservation. Cataloguing this album made its contents searchable by several criteria and through the collections management system, organized related information into a useful format. Preservation of the album is enhanced because the catalogue record reduces handling of the actual object, providing a visual reproduction and relevant information including author, date and dimensions. The album is also made accessible to the public by uploading the records to George Eastman House's online collection through the eMuseum system. There were four stages involved in the cataloguing of Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album: 1. Creating item records; 2. Adding images; 3. Cataloguing records; 4. Making the records available online.

Stage 1: Creating Item Records The Museum System (TMS) is the collections management system used at George Eastman House. The system provides access to the collections database through modules such as objects, constituents, media, exhibitions and bibliography. The first stage of the cataloguing process was to split the original lot record for the album into separate item records for each page. This allowed each photograph to be identified as a single entity. The lot record for the album is a single record using the classification of "album" that represents all 52 photographs. Splitting this into 53 records (52 item records with the classification of "photo" + 1 lot record with the classification of "album") allows researchers to view the contents of the album and search individual photographs through TMS. Before sending the request for item records to the Registrar's office, the original lot record was reviewed in order to determine what fields required changes and what information would be kept. This also revealed what information was missing and needed further research. Changes were made to Classification, Constituent(s) and Title fields,
8

whereas fields such as Medium, Credit Line and Location, were kept and duplicated into item records to save the trouble of re-entering the information fifty-two more times. Other fields, such as Dimensions and Inscription(s) were left empty for new information specific to each photograph to be added. Once the item records were created, the next step was to add the corresponding image to each record.

Stage 2: Adding Images

Adding a digital image of the photograph to the corresponding catalogue record is an important key to better preservation. It provides a visual reference for the researcher, making it possible to view the album's contents without handling the actual album. Without images in the records, researchers still need to handle the album in order to see the photographs. In the case of a bound album, it is impossible to look at one photograph without affecting the condition of other photographs in the album. As it will be discussed later, some album page connections are weak for certain pages in this album and any unnecessary handling should be avoided. Thus, it is especially important to have digital images attached to the catalogue records. The album was photographed by Photographic Services at George Eastman House m high resolution TIFF format for the purpose of reproduction. These files were compressed into smaller JPEG format using Photoshop in order to be used in TMS.

Stage 3: Cataloguing of Records

The third stage is the cataloguing of the individual photographs. One of the main reasons this album was not given much attention in the collection is that all information in the album is written in Japanese, a language not many people in the institution can read. It was necessary to translate the text in order to make the album more available to a broader English-speaking audience. Thus, the translation of Japanese captions into English titles became a major task of cataloguing. Each caption was translated and entered into the Title on object field. Even though it is possible to see the Japanese caption in the digital image, some of these are not clear and are difficult to read. For this reason, Japanese captions are recorded in the Inscription(s) field using the Japanese

9

Romanization system; 24 so researchers familiar with Japanese may read the captions more easily. The Kunrei-siki system (ISO 3602) was chosen from the many systems of Romanization for use on this project,25 as it is the international standard. Some information in the lot record remains different from the item records. Though research established a date of ca. 1940-1941 for the photographs, a slightly later date of ca. 1941 is used for the publication date. The photographer is also credited differently between the lot record and the item record. The album credits four photographers, Tosio Kaneya, Akira Yosizawa, Syunpei Enza and Masayasu Kuhara, 26 for the photographs in this album. It is, however, unclear as to which photographer made which photographs. 27 Rather than attributing each photograph to all four photographers, item records use Unidentified, Japanese as the original photographer. The four known photographers are entered as Constituent(s) with the role of Original Photographer only in the lot record. This directs a researcher looking for the work of any one of these photographers to this album without the cumbersome attribution of every photograph in the album to four photographers. Additional information relating the subject of each photograph, such as information on the vessels, is entered into the Notes section of the item record. 28

Stage 4: Making the Records Available Online

The last stage of the cataloguing process is to make the information available to the public by adding the album to George Eastman House's existing online collection (http://www .emuseum.eastmanhouse.org/code/eMuseum.asp ?page=collections).

The Romanization of Japanese (romaji or romazi) is the phonetic transcription of Japanese language using Latin alphabets. The three main Romanization systems are Hepburn Romanization, Nihon-siki and Kunrei-siki, which is standardized by the Japanese Government and the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 3602. See Appendix A for a summary of the Kunrei-siki Romanization rules. 25 Kunrei-siki is followed only on translations done by myself It may not apply to terms relating to specific entities, such as company name, author names and published book titles, in which recognized versions of Romanization already exist. In these cases, the existing version is used. 26 In Japanese Kanji characters:~:&~$ (Kaneya, Tosio); 15~~ (Yosizawa, Akira); lllmi~.IJZ (Enza, Syunpei); and ?J. J]j(JE~ (Kuhara, Masayasu). The proper reading of these names has not been confirmed. The Romanization is done based on the conventional way of reading them and it is possible that there are · different ways of reading these names. 27 The only information found on these four photographers is that Enza worked as the filming assistant in the movie, "Sanren hana," in 1935. Further research is required for the biographic information of these
~hotographers.

online collection allows researchers to view low-resolution images of the museum's collections as well as search the database. An object package with a short description that included all 53 record of the album was created in TMS, which is linked to the online collection, making the low resolution image and basic information in the record, such as the title, date, medium and dimension of the photograph available to the public. In Japan, the copyright for photographs made prior to December 31, 1956 has expired. 29 Though there should be no problem in showing the photographs from Antarctic
Ocean Whaling Photo Album online, out of respect to Company N, the original publisher,

we will wait for their approval before using the images online.

The Physical Structure

The Antarctic Whaling Photo Album contains 52 fiber-based gelatin silver prints, all approximately llcm x 16cm. The album itself measures 22.7cm x 29.2cm x 3cm. The front and back of the album are boards covered with blue cloth. On the front cover of the album printed in yellow is a Japanese Kanji character meaning "whale." On the back cover of the album embossed into the cloth is the symbol of Company N.

Fig. 1 - Front & Back of the Album

The album begins with a title page, followed by a page with calligraphy on Japanese paper. The frontispiece photograph is followed by 51 photographs adhered on both sides of26 pages. The format of the album is called a laced scrapbook in western bookbinding terminology, which was the most commonly used structure for photo albums from 1920 to 1960. In Japanese bookbinding, the style is known as Yamato-toji, a "flat-cord-bound pouch book."30 The western term of laced scrapbook can refer to any book with leaves bound together on one side using cords, but the Japanese Yamato-toji has a more strict defmition. A Yamato-toji has four holes opened on the text block at one side, usually on the right hand side, where the spine will be, and tied with two decorative cords into two knots. It often uses comer pieces to reinforce the top and bottom of the spine. The front

Antarctic Whaling Photo Album is bound at the left hand side and opens from
right to left like western books. At first, this may seem strange, as most Japanese books are bound at the right hand side and open from left to right. However, it is a misconception that all Japanese books open from left to right. The binding of a book is usually decided by the layout of its content. As a general rule, if the text is written vertically, the book is bound at the right and opens from the left, so the flow of the text moves from right to left, which is how the language is read. However, if the text is written horizontally, as often happens in science books that include equations, numbers and alphabets, the book will be bound at the left and open from the right to keep the flow ofthe text in the logical order of left to right. 31 Although Antarctic Whaling Photo Album does not contain anything like equations, there are more photographs of horizontal format (32 prints) than vertical format (20 prints). The captions on these horizontal prints, as well as the title and the calligraphy at the opening of the album are all written horizontally. Therefore, it is logical that the publisher chose the left-binding format to

A Yamato-toji has four holes opened on the text block at one side, usually on the right hand side, where the spine will be, and tied with two decorative cords into two knots. It often uses comer pieces to reinforce the top and bottom of the spine. The front

and back covers are often made out of wood panel or thick paper covered with cloth. In Antarctic Whaling Photo Album, compensation stubs have been placed along the spine between every two pages to compensate for the added thickness of the photographs.

Antarctic Whaling Photo Album is bound at the left hand side and opens from right to left like western books. At first, this may seem strange, as most Japanese books are bound at the right hand side and open from left to right. However, it is a misconception that all Japanese books open from left to right. The binding of a book is usually decided by the layout of its content. As a general rule, if the text is written vertically, the book is bound at the right and opens from the left, so the flow of the text moves from right to left, which is how the language is read. However, if the text is written horizontally, as often happens in science books that include equations, numbers and alphabets, the book will be bound at the left and open from the right to keep the flow of the text in the logical order of left to right. 31 Although Antarctic Whaling Photo Album does not contain anything like equations, there are more photographs of horizontal format (32 prints) than vertical format (20 prints). The captions on these horizontal prints, as well as the title and the calligraphy at the opening of the album are all written horizontally. Therefore, it is logical that the publisher chose the left-binding format to

maintain the flow of the text. It is still unusual, however, to see a left-bound book produced in the traditional Japanese binding style, which adds to the unique character of this album.

The Condition The album appeared to be in fairly good condition at first glance. No significant deterioration or damage was observed, and the structure seemed to be fairly stable. However, several problems became apparent after close examination during condition reporting. See Appendix B and C for condition reports on album pages and photographs.

Problem 1: The Album Pages The first problem is with the album page, and the high acidity of the paper. A simple pH test on the album pages revealed an acidity level of 4.3 - 4.5, which is extremely acidic compared to the recommended pH value of 7.2 to 9.5 for storage materials for black-and-white photographs. Acidification of paper can be caused by atmospheric pollution, the paper manufacturing process and the acidic substances contained in the paper, such as lignin. The use of non-archival adhesives can also contribute to the acidification ofthe paper while heat and moisture catalyze the process of deterioration. 32 In the case of this album, the poor quality of the paper is probably the main cause of deterioration. _ There are three types of papers used in this album: a thinner paper used as the endpaper; the page of Japanese paper with calligraphy; and the heavier album pages, from which the pH reading was taken. All three types of paper have their own problems. The endpapers are yellowed with brown stains over the entire surface from the adhesives applied to their back. The album pages have turned yellow, become brittle, and lost their

flexibility. Some cockling is observed at the top part of the pages with some traces of mold, indicating that the album had some water damage. The edges of the pages, especially at the bottom corner, are creased and tom from repeated handling. The page connections have been weakened from the stress of repeated handling and might become detached if handled excessively. The Japanese paper with the calligraphy has more flexibility and is in better condition compared to the other pages. However, there is an interesting phenomenon observed on this page placed between the title page and the frontispiece. The Japanese paper is slightly yellowed, except for the part that is in contact with the frontispiece photograph.

Fig. 5- Transfer of the image on the Japanese paper (detail from 2003:1185:0001)

There is also a slight transfer of the image from the photograph. According to paper conservator, Tsen-Jung Ku, this is because the photograph protects the Japanese paper from the acidity of the album page. The photograph blocks the acid in the album page from migrating to the Japanese paper and where there is more silver density in the photograph, there is more protection provided to the Japanese paper. The acid migration through the photograph onto the Japanese paper imprints a faint and yellow reversed image of the photograph onto the Japanese paper. This phenomenon not only demonstrates how severely acidic the album page is, but also suggests the possibility of photographic deterioration caused by the acidic paper. 33

33 Even though not as prominent as it is in the Japanese paper page, a similar phenomenon is also observed on some of the album pages where a vertical photograph and a horizontal photograph face each other. The part of the page that is in contact with the adjacent photograph is less yellowed compared to other parts of the page, creating an outline of the adjacent photograph on the page.

15

Problem 2: The Photographs
Chemical deterioration, including discoloration, image fading and silver mirroring is the most prominent problem. All of the prints except one have yellowed from inadequate washing during

processing. The residual fixer in the prints decomposes over time and reacts with the image silver to form a

yellowish to brownish silver sulfide stain. This deterioration, which affects the midtones first, is catalyzed by the presence of high relative humidity. 34 When examined closely, even the one print that did not appear yellowed shows a slight yellow stain beginning to form in the midtones. A shiny mirror-like appearance, known as silver mirroring, is seen in the dark areas of many of the photographs when examined under raking light. This is caused by the chemical reaction between the silver and acidic pollutants. The image silver is oxidized by pollutants, such as hydrogen sulfide, into silver ions, which migrate to the surface of gelatin, where they are transformed into metallic silver and silver sulfide. Moisture is acting as a catalyst in this process, as well. The major preservation problems for these photographs, as discussed above, are residual chemicals, atmospheric acidic pollutants and moisture. The residual chemicals are an internal problem, while pollutants and moisture are external factors. As the album is now stored in a climate controlled vault, which minimizes the effect of humidity and

As mentioned previously, cockling is observed at the top part of the pages with some traces of mold, indicating that the album had some water damage, creating at least a temporary environment with high relative humidity.

16

air pollutants, the unaddressed problem to be concerned with in preservation of the album is the internal problem, the residual chemicals.

Fig. 7 - Silver mirroring on the photograph (detail from 2003:1185:0001)

Problem 3: The Adhesives An unknown type of adhesive was used to adhere the photographs to the album pages. This adhesive has lost its strength over time, and the photographs are now coming loose from the album pages. Although most are still attached to the album pages, they may become detached with repeated handling. Weakened adhesive and the resulting loose prints threaten our understanding of the album. Much meaning would be lost if the photographs were preserved without preserving their original context within the album.

17

Chapter 4: Preservation of the Album
Understanding the significance of albums and how to preserve them is an important aspect of managing photographic collections. Although album conservation has been studied since the 1980's, there is no systematic guideline of how to classify or to treat different albums. Just as each album is unique, each case of album preservation is unique and the problem must be dealt with a case-by-case manner. As seen from the previous section, there are two types of problems that need to be considered for the preservation of the album: the external problems, such as the storage conditions and handling; and the internal problems, such as the acidic pages and the residual chemicals in the photographs. The external problems can be controlled through proper storage and handling, whereas the internal problems may require conservation treatment.

Storage of the Album

The album is now well protected, housed in a one-piece phase box type wrapper with an inner mat board liner 35 and stored in a climate-controlled vault. 36

~)

Fig. 8- Enclosures of the album

Only archival materials that have passed the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) should be used in the construction of the enclosure. PAT is a worldwide standard (ISO 14523) for archival quality in photographic enclosures developed by Image Permanence Institute in Rochester, New York. The test predicts possible interaction between photographic materials and enclosure materials. Samples of the enclosure material are placed with an image interaction detector and a stain detector in a climate-controlled chamber of70 °C and 86% relative humidity for 15 days. The degree of fading and staining on the detector is measured to determine the suitability of the tested sample as an archival material. 36 The recommended storage condition of black-and-white photographs is at a temperature below 18°C with the relative humidity of 30% to 50%. With black-and-white prints generally the colder the temperature the better.

35

18

This is adequate for the album in its present condition. If the structure of the album becomes weakened in the future, a new phase box or a clamshell box design will be needed. If the photographs become completely detached from the album pages, they should be housed individually using archival paper sleeves 37 and stored in the same case with the album. The page from where the photograph was originally placed in the album and the text on the page should be transcribed on the enclosure using a pencil. Adding polyester interleaving would help protect the photographs from the acidic pages. However, interleaving would increase the thickness of the album and add extra stress to the album spine. Interleaving does not seem necessary for the album at this time.

Handling of the Album
Repeated handling and unnecessary use of this album will lead to further damage. Care should be taken when handling the album with careful attention to the handling guidelines of the study center. An additional guideline pertaining to album handling should also accompany the album. 38 This guideline addresses issues such as weak page connections and partially detached photographs that may be damaged by careless handling. There are three key points to keep in mind when handling this album. First, pages should be turned gently by holding the page not at the bottom comer but along the side. The missing comer of page 24 and the crescent creases at the bottom comer of many pages are the result of improper handling. Some of the creases are beginning to tear and as the paper is brittle, continued handling at the same spot will result in loss of the comer. Second, the pages should not be forced to lie flat. The spine of the album is rather stiff and the pages do not always lie flat. Forcing this will damage the spine and page connection. A book cradle should be used to provide extra support and minimize the stress to the album. The album page can also be lightly supported using one hand while viewing the album.

37 38

Paper envelopes made of PAT tested material is a good absorbent of acidic pollutants. See Appendix D: Handling Guidelines for Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album.

19

Third, partially detached photographs should not be handled. When turning the album page, extra attention should be given to these loose photographs, so they are not bent or creased.

Conservation of the Album There are several options for conservation treatments that can improve the condition of this album. The simpler treatments are the surface cleaning and re-adhering of the photographs. Surface cleaning can be done using cotton swabs and chemicals such as Kodak Film Cleaner. This process removes surface dirt and greasy residues from the surface of the photograph without removing the photograph from its page. The readhering of the photographs may be done through reactivation of the residual adhesives that remain on the back of the photographs, or by reapplying archival adhesives to the loose photographs. A more elaborate treatment is a thorough cleaning of the album that involves unbinding the album and washing the pages and photographs separately. This is possible because the binding style of the album allows it to be dis bound and reassembled. With this treatment, each problem can be treated separately without affecting other parts of the album. Photographs, once removed from the album pages can be washed thoroughly to remove residual chemicals, while the album pages can also be washed and treated separately to neutralize the acidic substances contained in the paper. Damages to the pages, as well as the album cover can be repaired, photographs can be re-adhered and the album can be reassembled to its original form after treatment. 39 These conservation treatments should be carried out by conservation technicians, or under their supervision. Conservation treatment requires time, money and special training. Treatment priority is given to objects in poor condition that require urgent action. Factors such as the value of the object also play a role in determining conservation priorities. Even though damaged, this album is still in relatively stable condition. As long as it is kept

It is important to keep in mind that an album is not simply a group of photographs, but also an object with unique meanings. To take apart its content is to spoil the integrity of the object. Therefore, it is recommended not to disassemble the album or to remove the photograph from the album page if there is no need to do so. Disassembling is suggested here because it is possible to reassemble this album into its original form.

39

20

under a climate-controlled environment with minimum handling, there is no urgent need for further treatment.

Treatment Proposal

The following is a treatment proposal for the conservation of this album. A threelevel treatment approach is recommended for this album depending on available resources. · Level 1: Preventive Conservation Keep the album in its current condition without any treatments. The focus here is on preventive conservation, which may involve the creation of preservation tools such as digital surrogates and handling guidelines. The condition of the album is monitored and new enclosures may be made as needed. · Level2: Simple Treatments on Photographs Simple treatments such as surface cleaning and activation of the adhesives to readhere the photographs. · Level3: Complete Cleaning of the Album Involves unbinding the album, thorough washing and treatment of photographs and album pages, and the restoration and reinforcement of the album cover and pages. Interleaving can be integrated into binding when reassembling the album to protect the treated photographs.

Conclusion
Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album is neither a masterpiece of photography
nor a one-of-a-kind object of great monetary value. Rather, it is a historical record of a fascinating subject illustrated with photographs, with a distinct charm that captivates its viewer. Until now not much attention has been paid to this album. Little was known about the subject of whaling within the museum and the fact that the text was in Japanese hindered further research. This project has eliminated the language barrier by providing translations to the text and uncovered interesting facts about the album and its history. Cataloguing has made the album more accessible to both museum staff and the public by making the album content available in TMS and eMuseum. Cataloguing and digitization of the album has also helped with the preservation of the album by reducing unnecessary handling. The assessment of the album condition and its preservation issues will hopefully become a guideline for monitoring and caring for this album in the future. There are still unanswered questions to Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album, such as who are the four photographers, how many copies of the album were made and how many still exist today. This can be the focus of further research. I hope that the research, cataloguing and preservation assessment done for this project will lay the groundwork for further preservation and research relating to this album.

APPENDIX F- TMS Catalogue Records

Object Package Description Antarctic Ocean Whaling Photo Album was published around 1941 by a marine product company in Japan. The album contains 52 gelatin silver prints that depict whaling activities and whaling vessels made during the whaling season of 1940-1941. Photographs are arranged in a chronological narrative, showing the departure of the whaling ship from the port, the pursuit of whales and cutting up of the carcass. The album also includes photographs of Japanese whaling vessels. Each photograph is accompanied by a one-sentence descriptive caption. The album was produced for the purpose of introducing the company's whaling business to related companies as well as the company's employees. It is covered in a blue cloth with the title "Whale" in Japanese calligraphy printed in yellow and includes a page with the slogan "Syokuryo hokoku" (By food serve the country), also in calligraphy. Although the photographs are yellowed with silver mirroring, the album is in fairly stable condition.

2003:1185:0024 Title on Object: Placing a marker on the body, discharging it and heading for the next catch Classification: Photo Original photographer: Unidentified Dates: ca. 1940-1941 Dimensions: Image: 16.2 x 11 em Inscription: mount recto (printed in Japanese): hyosikiki wo tatete hyoryu si tugi no hokaku ni mukau [place a marker on the body, discharge it and head for the next catch] Notes: In pre-war whaling, a marker was placed on the whale and the whale was left floating in the water to be collected later in order to save the time of repeatedly bringing catches to the mother ship. However, the thick skin of the whale traps heat inside the body, accelerating the rate of decomposition and affecting the quality of the meat. In post-war whaling, with its emphasis on meat rather than oil, each catch was brought to the mother ship for processing in order to keep the meat fresh.
