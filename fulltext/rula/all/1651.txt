MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERZATION AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SPOT WELDED DISSIMILAR ADVANCED HIGH STRENGTH STEELS (AHSS)

Muhammad Sohaib Khan

M.A. Sc. , Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, 2008

Abstract
Increased use of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) in resistance spot welding is necessary for manufacturing safe and affordable vehicles. A significant body of work has been completed to document the resistance spot weldability of AHSS . However, In automotive applications, the dissimilar material combinations are very common In automotive construction. There is no literature regarding the resistance spot welding of dissimilar materials DP600 and HSLA350 steels. The objective of this study was to investigate the weldability and mechanical properties of resistance spot welds between HSLA350 and DP600 steels. The dissimilar material spot weld performance was different than the similar material spot welds in each of the HSLA350 and DP600 steels and exhibited different heat affected zone hardness. The DP600 weld properties played a dominating role on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the dissimilar material spot welds. However, the fatigue performance of the dissimilar welds was similar to that of the HSLA welds. Fatigue tests on the dissimilar materials spot welds showed that at a given stress amplitude the 5.5 mm diameter nugget exhibited higher fatigue strength than the 7. 5 mm diameter nugget.

CHAPTER ONE

Introduction

Advanced high strength steels (AHSS) have been used in the automotive industry for weight reduction, safety improvements and cost saving. The most common AHSS steels include dual-phase (DP) steels, complex-phase (CP) steels, transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels and martensitic (MART) steels. The higher initial work hardening rate combined with excellent uniform and total elongation give DP steels a much higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and a lower ratio of yield strength (YS) to UTS than conventional low carbon or highstrength low-alloy (HSLA) steels at a similar level of YS. These characteristics have made AHSS attractive for automotive applications [1]. For joining sheet metal components, the preferred fabrication method is resistance spot welding for its simple and cheap operation with typically 2,000 to 5,000 welds in a vehicle assembly [2]. A typical application of spot welds in a car body is shown in Figure 1.1. One of the challenges in adopting AHSS is that the higher alloy content required to obtain the bi-phase microstructure promotes increased hardenability in the fusion zone (FZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ) where high cooling rates are encountered during the weld thermal cycle, influencing the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the spot welded areas and heat affected zones. The investigation of these changes is very important for the safety and performance of the welded joints.

Spot welds [1}.

Moreover, in automotive industry and testing labs, the definition of the quality of the spot welds can differ. Accordingly, the tests and criteria used to distinguish the bad welds are different. Among all quality control tests, the peel test and the pry checking test are simple procedures for the quality test, especially easily applied in the plant. The static tensile shear test and fatigue tensile shear test are the two common testing methods to quantitatively observe the mechanical properties of spot welds [3]. The tensile shear and fatigue test performance of spot welds continues to be significant factors in vehicle design.

A significant body of work has been completed to document the resistance spot weldability of AHSS. Most of the above work has focused on welding a specific grade of steel to itself. However, in automotive applications, a dissimilar combination of material type and thickness are specified in order to tailor material properties for local requirements [4]. The dissimilar materials combinations are very common in automotive construction as shown in Figure 1.2 and their adoption provides possibilities for the flexible design of the product by using each

The present work is aimed at investigating the weldability and mechanical properties of resistance spot welds between HSLA350 and DP600 steels. For this purpose, weldability and mechanical properties of resistance spot welds between similar materials will also be evaluated. The focus of the present work will be on the microstructure, mechanical properties and welding behavior of the spot welds in similar and dissimilar materials combination. The fatigue performance of dissimilar materials combination HSLA/DP will be investigated in relation to nugget diameters and different fracture modes will be analysed.

Literature Review

2.1

Introduction to resistance spot welding

Resistance spot welding (RSW) is a major sheet-metal joining process in many industries, such as the automotive and the appliance industries. Elihu Thompson invented this process in 1877 [2]. RSW applications have grown enormously since the first sheet-welded automobile was introduced in 1933. Due to the higher joining speed, resistance spot welding machines can be associated with automated robotic welding cells in a car assembly plant. Resistance spot welding, which is normally performed on pedestal welders, consists of a power supply for generating large currents and a pneumatic cylinder for applying a force load on the metal sheets to be welded. After the electrodes squeeze the sheets, a large current is applied through the workpiece. The heat produces the temperature which exceeds the metal melting point to generate a molten nugget. The amount of current can be controlled by adjusting the conducting angle of a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) with a microcontroller-timer [3]. The electrodes are water cooled, so the metal to electrodes contact is kept below the melting point. Complexity also arises from the variety of base metals to be welded, coating on the surface and types of welding machines. Commercially available machines include pedestal press type welders and various gun-type welders, e.g., C-gun and scissor gun welders. The power source of these guns can be single phase AC, three phase AC or medium frequency DC (MFDC) [2].

2.1.1

Principle of resistance spot welding

Figure 2.1 shows a schematic diagram of the spot welding operation. Two or more metal sheets (base metals) are placed between two water-cooled copper electrodes and are subjected to a large squeeze pressure. A relatively large current is then passed at low voltage through the sheets being welded. The resistance offered to the flow of electric current produces heat. The amount of heat (Q) generated is related to the electrical power input, expressed as [3] , (2.1) where I is the current, R is the resistance and t is the time for which weld current is passed through the sheets (weld time).The heat produced causes the interface to melt and form a solid joint. The joint formed at the interface of the two sheets (faying interface) is called a button or nugget.

The total resistance R between the two electrodes consists of three components; the bulk resistance of the sheet, Rb, the contact resistance at electrodes-sheets interface, Rc and the contact resistance at the faying interface, R1 .Thus, for sheets of the same material and equal thickness [3], (2.2) The maximum resistance to the flow of current is offered by the faying interface [6]. Therefore, the maximum heat is generated at the faying interface causing local fusion. Electrodes transmit sufficient pressure to produce a better joint. The amplitude and duration of the welding current must be controlled accurately to facilitate the growth of the nugget. A typical spot welding operation is controlled by a weld schedule, whose time steps are controlled by a spot welding controller. A weld schedule is usually divided into four steps, as shown in Figure 2.2: 1. Squeeze time, or the time between the first application of electrode force and the first application of welding current. 2. Weld time, or the actual time the current flows . 3. Hold time, or the period during which the electrode force is applied and the welding current is shut off. 4. Off time, or the period during which the electrodes are not contacting the workpieces. Burn-through, cracks, porosities and distortion are avoided by controlling heat input through suitable current and weld time selection. During the spot welding of two sheets, a joint should be formed at the faying interface and not at the electrode-sheet interface.

2.1.2

Nugget growth and expulsion phenomenon in RSW

Among the four stages (squeeze, weld, hold, and off) the weld stage is most important. During the weld stage, the interface melts to form a solid joint. The joint formation in galvanized steels (steels coated with zinc) is different from that of uncoated steels [7-12]. During the squeeze cycle (Figure 2.2), the sheets are squeezed between the two electrodes. There is no thermo-mechanical phenomenon taking place during this stage. When two metal sheets are brought into contact, their surfaces will touch only at points where the tips of asperities on one surface meet those of the other. With increasing pressure, these asperities will flatten, but the actual points of contact will only be a fraction of the apparent contact area. Once the current begins to flow, the regions of points of contact will heat up and soften, thereby allowing other asperities to touch and become heated. This process continues until
7

the entire area softens and all the asperities come into contact. Thus, for the first few welding cycles, the breakdown of insulating films and asperities takes place. The fall of asperities is much faster for galvanized steels due to the softness and low melting temperature of zinc [11, 12]. In zinc-coated steels, surface films breakdown and contaminants form local hot spots which may be detrimental to the life of electrode tip. The first few cycles involve heating of zinc and Fe-Zn alloys on the electrode-sheet interface and melting of zinc coating at the faying interface. The molten zinc will then start to be forced away from the centre of the electrode tips to form a liquid 'halo'. A mechanical seal starts to develop at the periphery of the electrode contact area. The seal is formed at both the faying and electrode-sheet interfaces. The electrodes are forced through the zinc coating at the periphery. The seal traps the remaining zinc and weld metal between the electrode tips at both interfaces. The increase in the halo size with the formation of the seal increases the area of current flow. Then, iron to iron contact formation starts. When a substantial amount of the metal reaches the melting or softening temperature, the faying interface collapses to form a softening of the surrounding material. If the same amount of current continues to flow, the material is abruptly expelled at the sheet-sheet interface. This is called expulsion [3].

The seal formed along the electrode periphery at the faying interface keeps the substrate (steel) in place as it is heated to the softening temperature, melts and forms a weld. As a result, the material is constrained, and thermal expansion pushes the electrodes apart (away from each other). Once the thermal expansion becomes large enough, the seal is broken and molten metal is suddenly free to expel radially. Another mechanism of expulsion occurs when the molten steel over 1500 °C becomes higher than the zinc boiling point at 907 °C [ 11]. This boiling zinc may force the electrodes apart and expel both zinc and iron.

Recent studies on resistance spot welding of DP steel

Spot welding issues in conventional steels are different from those in AHSS. The major issues involved in the spot welding of AHSS are smaller weld lobe width and interfacial or partial interfacial failures. Moreover, AHSS have richer chemistry than conventional steels, which leads to the formation of hard brittle nugget and weld defects such as shrinkage voids and cracks.

A significant body of work has been completed to document the resistance spot weldability of AHSS. Tawade [13] investigated robust weld lobes for welding DP600 to itself and other grades of HSLA, as well as extra deep drawing quality (EDDQ) steels. Different welding pulses and electrode tip designs have been used to increase the lobe width and achieve heat balance. Marya et al. [ 14] developed an empirical equation to predict the mode of failure for resistance spot welds of DP600 steel that determines a critical diameter of the weld nugget in relation to the material thickness and the ratio of maximum hardness to minimum hardness in the HAZ. Spot welds with nugget diameter greater than the critical weld diameter will fail via nugget pull out mode of failure and vice versa. Tao et a!. [ 15] investigated the deformation behavior of DP600 spot welds to measure the strain fields by utilizing the miniature tensile samples in single weld joint coupons in both tension and simple shear tests by incorporating all the three zones; base metal (BM), heat-affected zone (HAZ) and fusion zone (FZ). They found that most of the resistance spot welded joints are very resistant to shearing unless the weld FZ contains material defects as shown in Figure 2.3.

Yang et a!. [ 16] determined the relationship between the weld length of elliptical nugget for DP600 spot welds and critical specimen sizes, including specimen width and sheet thickness through analyzing the failure modes in tensile-shear testing using a statistical method. The results showed that the specimen thickness and weld length are the most important factors determining the interfacial fracture failure mode. Aiming at the interfacial fracture, the critical specimen thickness is proposed and is found to increase linearly with weld length as shown in Figure 2.4. So the interfacial fracture failure in DP600 can be reduced through increasing the weld length.

Tong eta!. [17] investigated plastic deformation of miniature tensile bars generated from DP steel weld fusion zone microstructures and found that only those fusion zones with substantial defects, e.g., shrinkage voids and cracks, failed prematurely. Volker et a!. [18] determined the weldability of DP steel and found that the adjustment of welding parameters towards increased electrode forces led to wider current ranges and to the formation of macroscopically flawless weld nuggets as shown in Figure 2.5. A post heating phase exerted a positive effect on the hardness of the welded joint. Sun et a!. [ 19] examined the effects of fusion zone size on failure modes, static strength and energy absorption of resistance spot welds (RSW) of DP800 and TRIP800 under lap shear loading condition. The results in this study showed that AHSS spot welds with conventionally required fusion zone size of 4~t cannot produce the favourable nugget pullout mode for both the DP800 and TRIP800 welds under lap shear loading. Moreover, the failure mode has a strong influence on weld peak load and 11

energy absorption for all the DP800 welds and the TRIP800 small welds: welds failing in the pullout mode have statistically higher strength and energy absorption than those failed in the interfacial fracture mode. For TRIP800 welds above the critical fusion zone level, the influence of weld failure modes on peak load and energy absorption diminishes. Tumuluru [20] investigated whether these higher-strength grades (DP590, DP780 and DP980) could be welded with simple, easy-to-use welding parameters. He found that welds with no imperfections were obtained in all three steel grades studied, which suggested that DP steels possess good weldability and could be welded with simple, easy-to-use welding parameters. All the three materials exhibited similar welding behavior and showed wide welding current ranges to achieve acceptable weld sizes. Joaquin et a!. [21] studied the effect of welding power source, electrode tip shape, welding current input, material type,

12

thickness and hold time on shrinkage voids for DP600, TRIP590, CP800 and boron steels. They found that hold time is the most important parameter affecting shrinkage voids in the weld. Longer hold time helps to reduce the formation of shrinkage voids as shown in Figure 2.6. The tendency to form shrinkage voids increases with the thicker materials and having rich chemistry. However, the formation of shrinkage voids is independent of coating conditions of steels.

Figure 2.6

Khan et al. [22] investigated the impact performance of different metallurgical types of AHSS, including DP, TRIP and ferritic-bainitic (FB) steels. They examined the effects of testing rate on failure loads, energy absorption and elongation by examining the fracture surface and failure paths. They found that the failure loads during tensile shear testing increased as test velocities increased, however there was no correlation between base metal strength and failure loads of the welds. Mimer et al. [23] proposed that the cause of interfacial fracture is associated with the hard brittle microstructure of the weld.

2.3

Recent studies on resistance spot welding of HSLA steel

High strength low alloy (HSLA) steels are commonly used in automotive applications, instead of conventional steels, owing to their higher yield point and tensile strength that contribute to a decrease in weight and fuel consumption. HSLA steel has an approximately constant strain hardening exponent value over most of its strain range than the DP steel with a similar yield strength as shown in Figure 2.7. Owing to these reasons, HSLA steels offer a very promising prospect in such a competitive and demanding industry. HSLA steels obtain their strength through hardening elements, e.g., Mn, Si and microalloys such as Nb, V or Ti. The carbon content is usually kept at a low level. Microalloying also favours the achievement of a fine grain microstructure and induces a precipitation hardening effect. Such treatments result in a considerable increase in strength combined with good formability and toughness relative to the strength level obtained [24].

Gould [25] studied the relationship between steel composition, steel gauge and susceptibility to hold time sensitivity through modeling primary dendrite spacing in resistance spot welds on a range of HSLA steels. The results indicated that solidification cracking and hold time sensitivity in spot welds is a function both of the primary dendrite spacing and the rate of thermal contraction of the solidified weld metal during solidification. Nietol et a!. [26] investigated various parameters that are used to control the characteristics and properties of galvannealed HSLA steel sheets welded by means of electrical resistance, for further applications at high production speeds. They found that increasing the hold time from 5 to 30 cycles results in stamps free of oxide as shown in Figure 2.8, but care has to be taken, as the amount of ferrite present within the welded nugget is reduced, and the micro hardness of the material increases with increasing the hold time. The best welding conditions to weld this type of galvannealed HSLA steel are obtained when a current of 9.5 kA is used with a holding time of 30 cycles.

Li eta!. [27] determined the effects of welding parameters such as welding current, electrode force, electrode design, cooling water temperature and flow rate and electrode holding on the weld nugget size, microstructure and residual stresses.

Recent studies on resistance spot welding of dissimilar materials

In automotive applications, a dissimilar combination of material type and thickness is specified in order to tailor material properties for local requirements [4]. The dissimilar materials combinations are very common in automotive construction and adoption of dissimilar metal combinations provides possibilities for the flexible design of the product by using each material efficiently, i.e., benefiting from the specific properties of each material in a functional way [5]. Due to the difference in physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the base metals, the resistance spot welding of dissimilar materials is more challenging than that of similar materials welding.

Kacar et a!. [28] investigated failure behavior of dissimilar resistance spot welds between low carbon steel and austenitic stainless steel. They concluded that an asymmetric fusion zone was obtained due to different electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of the materials. For spot welds made at low welding currents, low fusion zone hardness and small fusion zone size led to experiencing interfacial mode during shear tensile tests. For spot welds made at high welding currents, a higher hardness of fusion zone due to martensite formation and larger fusion zone led to experiencing a pullout failure mode during a tensileshear test. Hernandez et a!. [4] explored fusion zone microstructure in TRIP-HSLA spot welds with varied weld thermal cycles. They found that the fusion zone hardness was 16

uniform and softer than the TRIP-TRIP combination. The hold time from 0 to 10 to 20 cycles lowers the cooling rate in the fusion zone, with a softer microstructure. Hasanbasoglu et al. [29] determined the influence of peak weld current on the morphology, hardness and tensile shear load bearing capacity of dissimilar spot welds between austenitic and interstitial free steels. They found that the tensile shear load bearing capacity of welded materials increased with an increase in peak current. The nugget size on interstitial free steel side was larger than on the austenitic steel side as shown in Figure 2.9 and the failure occurred by tearing of interstitial free steel side of the spot welded materials under all conditions. The hardness of the weld nugget increased in interstitial free steel side because of difference of the change in the chemical composition.

Figure 2.9

(a) cross-section of the nugget with shrinkage cavities and (b) cavities [29].

Alenius et al. [30] evaluated spot weldability of dissimilar metal joints between stainless steels and nonstainless steels to determine the spot welding parameters for the dissimilar metal joints and to characterize the mechanical properties of the joints. They found that the

17

for dissimilar metal joints, the failure load of the cross-tension samples was about 72-78 % of that of the lap shear samples. The lap shear strength depends on the strength and thickness of the nonstainless steel. These dissimilar material welded joints were susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement in chloride solution at room temperature. Sun et al. [31] also investigated resistance spot welding of aluminum to steel by using an intermediate layer of cold rolled clad material of aluminum and steel (with an aluminum/steel ratio of 20/80). They observed two distinct fusion zones in the weld nugget. The nugget on the steel side was a regular, elliptical weld with dendritic grain structure inside the nugget region. The nugget on the aluminum side was the top half of the elliptical shape. Also, a thin, intermetallic compound formed on the aluminum/steel clad interface due to the welding heat input as shown in Figures 2.1 0. The static and dynamic strength of the dissimilar spot welds was comparable to those of the strength of self-piercing rivets under the same loading conditions.

2.5

Recent studies on fatigue of dissimilar materials spot welds

One of the major concerns in spot weld applications is fatigue, because these joints are exposed to variable loads in automobile structures. The strength of spot weld under fatigue loading conditions is therefore extremely important to the reliability, durability and safety design of automobiles. Vural eta!. [32] studied the fatigue strength of different nugget sizes of resistance spot welded joints between galvanized steel sheet and austenitic stainless steel. They found that the endurance limit of the similar steel sheet combination is higher than that of the dissimilar steel sheet combination. The low cycle fatigue response of all nugget diameters for each material combinations generally have similar fatigue trend in high load range as shown in Figure 2.11. They found that the fatigue strength of spot welds increases with the increasing sheet thickness. The fatigue strength of dissimilar material joints was found to be between the fatigue strength of nonstainless steel and stainless steel. Bae eta!. [33] investigated the fatigue strength of similar and dissimilar material combinations spot welds between stainless steel sheets (ST301 L and STS304L) and cold rolled steel sheets (SPCC and SPCD). They found that the fatigue strength of spot welded lap joints of similar and dissimilar STS301L and STS304L is relatively larger than those of SPCC and SPCD. Fatigue strength of the spot welded joints between dissimilar materials, i.e., STS304L, STS316L, SPCD and SPCC is lower than those of STS304L and STS316L.

Alenius et a!. [30] further investigated the corrosion fatigue performance of dissimilar materials Some researchers [34, 35] found that fatigue performance was independent of strength and microstructure at high-cycle-low-load fatigue lives after investigating three high strength uncoated steels- HSLA, DP, and TRIP, as well one low strength DQSK steel. They 19

considered that the high-cycle fatigue performance is controlled by sample geometry alone, such as weld nugget size, sheet thickness, and the corresponding joint stiffness.

2.6

Testing of spot welds

There are some drawbacks of RSW, such as the inability to produce quality welds consistently, and the lack of a reliable and effective quality evaluation method [2]. In the automotive industry and testing labs, the definition of the quality of the spot welds can vary

20

[36]. Accordingly, the tests and criteria used to distinguish the bad welds are different [37]. Among all quality control tests, peel test and pry checking test are simple procedures for the quality test, which are especially easy to be applied in the plant. The static tensile shear test and the fatigue tensile shear test are the two common testing methods to evaluate the mechanical properties of spot welds [3]. The tensile shear, cross-tension and fatigue test performance of spot welds continues to be an important consideration in vehicle design.

2.6.1

Weld lobe and welding current range test

The spot weldability of a specific material can be determined with the weld lobe diagram. Welding force, current, and time are the three major parameters that determine the nugget size. They can be controlled on a welding machine. Given certain electrodes, different materials require different combinations of the parameters to produce acceptable welds. A graph showing the function of the nugget size with the current and time under a certain force level is usually developed to guide the machine setup. This type of graph is called a weldability lobe due to the shape of the area as shown in Figure 2.12. Two curves divide the current-time plane into three regions. From lower-left to upper-right, the three regions are no weld and undersized weld region (resulting in a nugget, smaller than the minimum acceptable diameter -4-..Jt where t is thickness of sheet), good weld region, and expulsion region (resulting in expulsion or burn through) [2, 3 and 37].

21

Expulsion

nd undersized weld

Figure 2.12 A typical weldability lobe [3}.

If the welding parameters are set along any point on the left curve, and a peel test sample is welded with these parameters (I and t) , the peel test will result in the minimum acceptable nugget diameter (4~t) on the test weld. Welding parameters set along the right curve will produce expulsion on the test weld. The points inside the lobe curve will guarantee a weld with an acceptable nugget size. Since the weld strength is directly proportional to the weld diameter, an acceptable nugget size represents acceptable nugget strength. At a specific welding time, the current range with which an acceptable button diameter can be formed is called the 'lobe width' [37]. The lobe width at a specific welding time can be calculated from the lobe diagram by subtracting
Imin

from

Imax·

A larger (robust) lobe width represents a

bigger window for the selection of welding parameters and vice versa. A lobe width larger than 2000A is the acceptable lobe width for uncoated steels and 1500A for coated steels. Researchers found that weld lobe widths and their positions depend upon the type of coating, as well as amount of coating (coating weight) [49]. In general, coated steels have less contact

22

resistance and higher currents are necessary to weld them. Electrode tip wear is an important issue for spot welding of coated sheets. Howe and Kelley [3 8] showed that coating was constantly being picked up by electrodes. Zinc on the electrode face changes the topography and electrical characteristics of the electrode face. The degree of topography change depends upon the welding conditions and type of coated sheet being welded.

2.6.2

Peel test and weld button criterion

The peel test consists of peeling apart a spot weld manually. If correlated with the tensile shear test, it makes an ideal control test. The weld button is measured with a calliper and the average diameter D is calculated as follows [3 , 37].
D+d D=-2

(2.3)

where, D and dare the maximum and minimum diameters according to the pertinent rules, respectively (Figure 2.13). For crescent, oval or other irregularly shaped buttons, the calliper is rotated until D and dare located. Note that D and d are not necessarily perpendicular to each other. If the calculated nugget D is not within specified limits, welding parameters are adjusted to get the required size of the nugget. The volume of button plays an important role as almost all mechanical properties of the spot welded joints are related to it. The weld diameter is directly proportional to joint strength. The spot weld is said to be good if the average nugget diameter is between the following minimum and maximum nugget diameters. The minimum and maximum nugget diameters can be defined as follows [3 7].

23

Dmax = Diameter at expulsion current. Dmin = 4-Ji, where t =sheet thickness.

Peel test and diameter measurement [3].

2.6.3

Typical button failure modes

Figure 2.14 shows various fracture modes that can be observed from a peel test [39]. Full button pullout failure modes represent better joint strength and good weld conditions than interfacial or interfacial button pull out failures. Interfacial fracture modes are not acceptable failure modes. They represent a weak joint and cracks travel through the weld. In addition to the weld button criterion, the welds should look uniform and have a small indent from the electrode tip. The buttons, which have diameters in the range of minimum to maximum button diameters and show full button pull-out fracture mode, are called acceptable button diameters [39].

Microhardness test

Specimens are prepared, exercising care to avoid overheating of the weld area in cutting so as not to affect the surface hardness. A second cut parallel to the first should be made to obtain a sample of suitable height to mount in the hardness tester. Figure 2.15 shows a typical hardness test of the cross section of a spot weld.

Milititsky eta!. [40] investigated the metallurgical features and formation of imperfections in DP600 spot welds. They found no heat-affected zone (HAZ) softening for DP600, as shown in Figure 2.16.

Tensile shear, cross-tension and fatigue test

The tensile shear test consists of pulling apart a spot welded specimen. [3 7]. In the lap shear loading geometry, a shear load is applied. The weld nugget rotates to align with the loading line. When the load is increased, localized necking occurs. Fracture initiates at one of the

26

localized necking points when the ductility of the sheet metal is reached. Although a shear load is applied, the failure mode mechanism is tensile [42]. In a satisfactory tensile shear test, the weld nugget remains unimpaired and fracture occurs around the periphery of the joint, as shown in Figure 2.17 [3].

In the cross-tension loading geometry, a normal load is applied as shown in Figure 2.18. The failure mechanism is through-thickness shear around the spot weld nugget. A spot weld under cross-tension load fails at a lower load than a spot weld under lap-shear load [42].

Figure 2.18

Cross-tension test [ 41}.

27

There are two methods commonly used for fatigue testing depending upon the shape of the specimen [3]
1. Tensile shear fatigue test.

2. Cross tension fatigue test. Tensile shear specimens can be used to evaluate fatigue behavior of spot welded joints and to generate data for durability analysis. The load capacity of the testing machine should be compatible with the strength of the spot welds tested. Due to the small load needed to deform the specimen, the machine should be equipped with a specimen protection system to reduce the preload during specimen mounting. The test system should be verified before initiation and after completion of the program in accordance with ASTM E4, ASTM E467 and ASTM E 1012 or the machine should be calibrated every year [3, 37].

Experimental Procedure

The current chapter describes the materials, samples preparation, equipment and settings for tensile tests, cross-tension tests, fatigue tests, microhardness tests, optical image analysis system, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).

3.1

Materials and samples preparation

This section summarizes the procedure followed for preparing peel coupons, panel coupons, tensile shear coupons and cross tension coupons from the supplied sheets. The welded samples were prepared according to Auto/Steel Partnership procedures [37]. The ULSAB-A VC (Ultra Light Steel Auto Body - Advanced Vehicle Concepts) is the most recent addition to the global steel industry's series of initiatives offering steel solutions to the challenges facing automakers around the world to increase the fuel efficiency of automobiles, while improving safety and performance and maintaining affordability. Consistent with the terminology adopted for ULSAB, High Strength Steels (HSS) are defined as those steels with yield strengths between 210 and 550 MPa; Ultra-High Strength Steels (UHSS) are defined as steels with yield strengths greater than 550 MPa. The yield strengths of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) overlap the range of strengths between HSS and UHSS, as shown in Figure 3.1. The principal differences between conventional HSS and AHSS lie in their microstructures. AHSS are multi-phase steels, which contain martensite, bainite, and/or retained austenite in quantities sufficient to produce unique

29

mechanical properties. Compared to conventional micro-alloyed steels, AHSS exhibit a superior combination of high strength with good formability. This combination arises primarily from their high strain hardening capacity as a result of their lower YS/UTS [44].

Strength-formability relationships for conventional HSS, and AHSS steels [44].

The multi-phase AHSS family includes dual phase (DP), transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and complex phase (CP), and martensite (Mart) steels. Figure 3.1 data show the relative strengths and formability (measured by total % elongation) of conventional high strength steels and AHSS steels [44].

The materials selected in this study are hot-dipped galvannealed (HDGA) DP600 steel and HDGA HSLA350 steel. The microstructure of DP steels is comprised of soft ferrite and, depending on strength, between 20 and 70% volume fraction of hard phases, normally martensite [44]. Figures 3.2 and 3.3 display the microstructures of DP and HSLA steel, respectively. In DP

30

steel, the soft ferrite phase is generally continuous, giving these steels excellent ductility. When these steels are deformed, the strain is concentrated in the lower strength ferrite phase, creating a unique high work or strain hardening rate exhibited by these steels. The work hardening rate and the excellent elongation combine to give DP steels much higher ultimate tensile strength than conventional steels of similar yield strength. The DP steel exhibits higher initial work hardening rate, uniform and total elongation, ultimate tensile strength, and lower YS/TS ratio than the similar yield strength HSLA. The microstructure of the HSLA350 steel consists of polygonal ferrite, acicular ferrite, lath martensite and fine copper and niobium-carbonitride precipitates [45].

Peel and panel coupons

DP600 and HSLA350 were supplied in the form of sheets sheared to a size of 1200 mm x 1200 full coil width. The test materials were sheared so that the transferred "top surface" identification (ID) mark appears on all strips, panels, and coupons of coated sheet steels. The transferred rolling direction mark is only required on all coupon strips prior to coupon shearing and on the material characterization panel. Individual test or panel coupons do not require a rolling direction (RD) mark. About 100 mm of sheet from each sheet coil edge (X and Y in Figure 3.4) were sheared and scrapped to eliminate any potential effects of edge coating weight and sheet thickness variations on the test results [3 7].

After trimming edge X, the rolling direction mark was transferred to the sheet surface as shown in Figure 3.5. Two types of strips, called peel coupon strips and material characterization panel were sheared from the sheet. Peel coupons were sheared from the peel coupon strip. The material characterization panel was used for determining sheet thickness, coating weight, as well as coating and substrate composition [37]. Figure 3.5 shows a typical layout for extracting peel coupon strips from a trimmed sheet. Figure 3.6 shows the layout for shearing peel coupons from peel coupon strips. The detailed dimensions of a peel test coupon which is shown in Figure 3. 7 are given in Table 3.3. Using the RD mark as a reference, top surface ID marks were transferred to the secondary edge of each test coupon strip, as shown in Figure 3 .6. Special attention was given to keep the transferred RD mark on each strip. From the trimmed test coupon strip, the desired numbers of test coupons were sheared.

Tensile shear and cross-tension samples

The dimensions for the shear tension and cross-tension samples are shown in Table 3.5 and 3.6 and Figures 3.9 and 3.10 based on the A/SP standard [37]. Because all test welds on these samples are single welds, the current required to produce the proper weld size may be slightly different from the current that is required for the peel test.

3.2

Electrode installation

Before installing the electrodes in to the holders, they were coded T (for top) and B (for bottom) with a marker. The electrodes were installed in the adaptors and the cooling tubes were adjusted. An adequate electrode force (less than the target welding force) was applied temporarily to set the electrodes. Electrode alignment was checked by visual inspection. Adjustments were made to eliminate any misalignment. Full welding pressure was applied to seat the electrodes in the adaptors.

3.2.1

Electrode dressing

The electrodes were dressed if the electrode faces were not parallel to each other and had lower face diameters than specified. A 400 grit dressing file was inserted between the electrodes. Electrodes were brought together with a low (< 20 kgF) electrode force to prevent excessive material removal. The file was rotated in --180° and then back. Electrodes were retracted and the file was cleaned. To achieve a smoother finish on electrodes faces, an emery paper was folded on an uncoated steel sheet piece. The steel piece with emery paper was inserted in between the electrodes. The electrodes were brought together with a low electrode force and the emery paper was rotated 180° and then back [3 7]. Electrode dressings were applied only if the machined electrode face diameter was less than the specified(± 1 mm) or if the electrode face did not have a smooth finish.

39

3.2.2

Electrode conditioning and weld stabilization

The electrode face of each electrode was stabilized before using it for determining the welding current range. Stabilization of the electrodes is necessary because as-machined electrode faces did not give good repeatability. Figure 3.11 shows variation in weld button size and current with increasing number of welds when welding with new electrodes [3 7]. It shows that button diameter and weld current vary in a dynamic pattern at the beginning of the use of a new electrode. To compensate for this dynamic behaviour of new electrodes, a weld size stabilization procedure is necessary at the start of each test. This procedure conditions the faces of the fresh electrodes. The stabilization procedure requires approximately 80 to 250 welds. After the stabilization electrode faces get conditioned, they show less variation in button size. Thus, the stabilization promotes reproducibility of the test results. The stabilization procedure consists of adjusting the welding current as and when needed to maintain a specified or fixed weld size. As seen in Figure 3.11, during stabilization, the current is increased until the button size reaches a critical size called the stabilization weld size (SWS). SWS can be defined as 90% of the dressed face diameter. (e.g., SWS = 6.30 mm for 7.0 mm dressed face diameter). The SWS was rounded to ± 0.1 mm. In all cases, only the test weld (2nd weld) of the peel sample was used for establishing button size and fracture mode [3 7].

3.2.3

Procedure for electrode face and weld stabilization

The following steps were used for electrode stabilization [3 7]. During the stabilization process, the button size was determined through the peel test and calliper measurement. 1. Based on the test data previously obtained, welding parameters were set to a value that results in a no-fusion condition on the test weld of a peel sample. No fusion is the condition where there is no button formation of any size at the faying interface.

2. If a button of any size was obtained, the current setting was reduced by an interval of 1000A.

3. If no fusion was obtained, the current setting was increased in increments of 300A until a test weld button size of about 70% to 80% of SWS was obtained.

41

4. Once the weld button size was within 70% to 80% of SWS, the current setting was increased in the increments of 1OOA until the button size was within± 0.1 mm of SWS.

5. If the weld size was within ± 0.1 mm of SWS, without changing the weld parameter
settings, one row of 19 welds was made on the panel sample. All 19 welds should be welded without expulsion. If expulsion at any weld was observed, the process was stopped, the current was reduced by 300A and steps 4 and 5 were repeated. The direction of panel movement with respect to the machine throat was maintained as shown in Figure 3.12.

6. After welding a row of 19 welds without adjusting the current settings, two peel samples were welded and the average button size was measured.

7. If the average button size was not greater than + 0.1 mm of SWS, another row of 19 welds was welded.

8. Step No. 7 was repeated once more. If three consecutive 19 weld rows were welded without expulsion and the button diameter was within ± 0.1 mm of SWS after each 19 weld row, the stabilization procedure was ended.

9. If the average button diameter after step 6 dropped below the SWS, the current was raised in an interval of 1OOA and steps 4 to step 7 were repeated.

3.3.1

Welder and related equipment

Figure 3.13 shows a single phase, 60Hz (a cycle corresponds to 0.01667 seconds for a current frequency of 60Hz), AC, 50 kA pedestal resistance spot welder used in the present work, which is located in the spot welding research laboratory at ArcelorMittal Dofasco' s Research and Development department. The welder has a microprocessor-based digital MEDAR legend control with automatic voltage compensation. The transformer is capable of producing about a 1OOA secondary current increment per 1% current setting increment from 60o/o to 98%. The electrode force application system is pneumatic. Figure 3.14 shows MIYACHI, MM-121 B high precision weld checker used to measure secondary current and time (cycles) in the present study, which was used to compare with the reading from the DAS. It is capable of monitoring RMS values of welding current at the first cycle of AC. The measured values were displayed digitally on the front panel. The spot welder used in this study had a pneumatic force application system. The required electrode force was set in the spot welder. A Piezo-electric portable force gauge (Tuffaloy model601-8300MD, capacity 3000 lbs) shown in Figure 3.15 was used to check if the required force is maintained across the electrode tips. The tip of the force gauge was inserted between the gaps of two electrodes. The full welding force was applied by pressing the pedal. The force was displayed on the digital display of the force gauge.

Welding parameters

Welding schedules are prepared and implemented based on the A/SP standard and the field practice [37]. The welding current ranges for three different combinations DP/DP, HSLA/HSLA and HSLA/DP were determined at a weld time of 18 cycles; the welding current was set to a value that should result in a "no-fusion" condition on the test weld (2nd weld on the peel sample) at this welding time. The welding current was increased in intervals of 1OOA by increasing the % current settings by 1%. Once the minimum acceptable nugget diameter (4 .Yt) was achieved, the point showing the corresponding current was noted on the welding data sheet as a
Imin·

The

current was increased by another 1OOA and three different peel samples were welded at a given welding current. This procedure was repeated till expulsion was observed on the test weld. The expulsion points were noted on the welding data sheet and marked as
Imax.

The welding current

range data for three combinations can be found in Appendix (A1-A3), the welding and tempering parameters used in this investigation are given in Table 3.7. Electrodes with 7.0 mm diameter flat tip end made of copper chromium (CuCr) alloy ofRWMA class II were used.

Equipment and settings for peel, tensile, cross-tension and fatigue test

Figure 3.16 shows the digital calliper, locking pliers, edge cutter pliers, tongs, copper lever tube and bench vise used for the peel test [13]. Locking pliers (10 inch) and copper lever tube were used for pulling two sheets apart in the peel test. Edge cutter pliers (8 inch) were used for removing burrs and lips from the weld button. Mitutoyo, Series 500 Imperial model digital calliper with an accuracy of± 0.01 mm was used for measuring the button diameter. The measuring method according to the A/SP standard was followed [37]. Typically, three nugget diameters were averaged for each welding condition. Figure 3.1 7 and Figure 3 .18 show the computerized testing machines for tensile shear and cross-tension tests (SATEC- Ryerson Univ. testing machine - Model 60HV with 60000 lb capacity) and fatigue test (INSTRON 8801), respectively.

The tensile shear, cross-tension and fatigue tests were operated based on A/SP standard [37, 46]. For tensile shear and cross-tension tests, a crosshead velocity of 10 mm/min was used to capture

47

and quantify the spot welds static characteristics. The fatigue tests were carried out in the load control mode using a sine wave with frequency of 50 Hz and the R-ratios (Pmin/Pmax) of 0.1 and 0.5 for HSLA/DP combination with 7.5 mm and 5.5 mm nugget diameters. The specimen was mounted in the load control mode under the zero-load set point. For tensile shear and crosstension tests, three samples were tested and then averaged to obtain one data point while for fatigue tests two samples were tested on each load level.

A Clemex image analysis system shown in Figure 3.20 was used for the optical metallurgical examination. It is comprised of Clemex software adaptive to ASTM and ISO standard, a Nikon optical microscope (1 OX eye piece, five different object lens with the magnification 5x, 1Ox, 20x, 40x, and 1OOx), a high-resolution digital camera, and a high performance computer to carry out the detailed investigation. The microstructure was observed by the optical microscopy after etching with a 4% Nital reagent as shown in Figure 3.21.

SEM and EDS

The microstructures and fracture features at the different regions in cross section of the spot welds were examined using the SEM. The chemical compositions in the area of interest were conducted using electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), including high resolution mapping. The JSM-6380LV shown in Figure 3.22 is a high-performance scanning electron microscope with an embedded energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDS) which allows for seamless observation and has a high resolution of 3.0 nm. The customizable graphical user interface (GUI) allows the instrument to be intuitively operated, and Smile ShotTM software ensures optimum operation settings. Standard automated features include auto focus/auto stigmator, auto gun (saturation, bias and alignment), and automatic contrast and brightness [48]. The resolution of the SEM is much higher than an optical microscope (OM) because the electrons accelerated to 10,000 keV have a wavelength of 0.12 Angstroms, while the visible light has wavelengths from 4,000 to 7,000 Angstroms. The typical depth of field for OM and SEM is shown in Table 3.9 [49]. The equipped three detectors - secondary electron detector, backscattered electron detector, energy dispersive X-ray detector, can be used to examine different situations. General microstructure was revealed by etching with a 4% Nital reagent. For tensile shear, cross-tension and fatigue tests, the nugget diameters of the resistance spot welds for three different materials combinations were measured with the help of SEM. The nugget diameters for tensile shear and cross tension tests are 7.5 mm and for fatigue 7.5 mm and 5.5 mm, respectively.

Results and Discussion for Similar Sheet Welding

This chapter presents the results and discussion on the resistance spot welds of the DP600 and HSLA350 steels. This study is part of the preliminary program to evaluate the feasibility and properties of resistance spot welding of dissimilar sheet metals HSLA/DP.

4.1

Resistance spot welding of DP600 steel

4.1.1

Microstructure

The micrographs shown in Figure 4.1 represent typical variations in the microstructure from the base metal, across the heat-affected zone (HAZ), to the centre of the fusion zone. Figure 4.1 (b) shows that the microstructure in the base metal basically consists of evenly distributed martensite and bainite within a somewhat elongated ferrite phase. The martensite in the HAZ is larger and its volume fraction higher than in the base metal, as seen in Figure 4.1 (c). The fusion zone is predominantly martensitic with some bainite, as shown in Figures 4.1 (e) and (f). The transition region between the fusion zone and HAZ is shown in Figure 4.1 (d).The microconstituents with martensite, bainite and ferrite in the HAZ were finer than those of either the base metal or the fusion zone. This is due to the fact that austenitizing was incomplete in the HAZ and even when austenite grains formed, grain growth was restricted by the formation of martensite and bainite

55

and because of the thermal cycles [50-52]. The fine grain size of the HAZ and the resulting high density of grain boundaries provide obstacles to the formation of large lathlike martensite.

To understand the variations of the microstructure in spot welds, the welding process (e.g., welding heat input and cooling rate) needs to be considered. In RSW, the cooling rates are very high leaving insufficient time for carbon diffusion. Hence, the lath martensite is believed to form containing very thin regions of retained austenite between the laths, or pockets of laths, and possibly some lower bainite [52, 20]. The significant amount of martensite in the fusion zone makes it prone to shear fracture [51]. Moreover, the higher carbon and manganese contents in DP600 steel result in a higher hardenability. Therefore, the high cooling rate during RSW, coupled with the higher carbon and manganese contents, leads to the formation of martensite and bainite in the fusion zone and the HAZ of the DP600 steel.

4.1.2

Microhardness

Figure 4.2 shows micro-hardness profile in the weld of the DP600 steel, which exhibited a significant hardness increase from the base metal. Due to the higher content of alloying elements in the steel and the high cooling rate, the hardness of the weld nugget is about twice that of the base metal. The much higher hardness, and thus the YS and UTS [53, 54], in the weld nugget may be attributed to the formation of martensite, as shown in Figure 4.1(e) and (f).

Welding imperfections

Voids were observed in the centre of the welds as shown in Figures 4.3 (a) and (b).These voids are more commonly called shrinkage voids because of they are formed during solidification of the molten nugget and have a dendritic morphology. They are formed in heavier gauge material and/or material with richer chemistry [50, 21].

Effect of in-process tempering on micro hardness

Figure 4.4 shows microhardness versus distance into DP600 spot weld nuggets, tempered at different tempering times. It can be seen that, as tempering time increases the hardness of the weld decreases within the central region. This is due to the growth and coalescence of the cementite [53]. The size of the cementite constituent influences the mechanical behaviour of tempered martensite since increasing the particle size decreases the ferrite-cementite phase boundary area and results in softer and weaker material.

Effect of hold time on shrinkage voids

Figure 4.5 shows the area fraction of voids and void length vs. hold time. In RSW, the hold time is the interval during which the fused area solidifies under the applied electrode pressure at the end of the welding cycle. Shorter hold times do not allow the fused area to completely solidify, leaving behind voids in the final weld. With increasing hold time, both the volume fraction and length of the voids decrease. Similar results for resistance spot welds have been reported by Joaquin et al. [21] and Han et al. [55]. At the same time, increasing hold time and the attendant decreased cooling rate will increase autotempering which will decrease joint strength.

4.1.6

Effect of tempering and shrinkage voids on mode of failure

It was observed that reducing the hardness and reducing the volume fraction of shrinkage voids
by tempering did not have an impact on the mode of failure; the welds still exhibited interfacial fracture after tensile shear testing. To obtain a button pull-out failure , the fracture should start in the HAZ, indicating that the HAZ hardness plays an important role in determining the mode of failure [56, 57]. According to Marya et al. [14], the hardness ratio
Hmax

to

Hmin

of the HAZ

determines the mode of failure. If this ratio is large enough, then the material will fail via a button pull-out mechanism because it will facilitate the development of plastic strains in the HAZ instead of the harder fusion zone. Conversely, if this ratio is small, the weld will fail via

61

interfacial fracture. Marya et al. [14] have developed the following empirical equation in which the critical diameter is given by:

de

= 0.53 ! 3 ' 22 + 8.48 (Hd

/

Hd

min ) - .

1 24

(4.1)

where de is the critical diameter, t is the material thickness and Hmax1Hmin is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum hardness in the HAZ. A spot weld with a diameter smaller than the critical diameter de will fail via interfacial fracture, and a spot weld with a diameter greater than

de will fail via button pull-out. The data from the present experiments were applied to Equation
(4.1) and the results are shown in Table 4.1.

The fracture modes observed experimentally are in agreement with those predicted by Equation (4.1 ). The computed values of the critical diameter de of the experimental welds are much higher than their original diameters. Hence, the experimental welds all exhibit interfacial fracture consistent with the right hand side of Equation (4.1 ).

4.1. 7

Effect of tempering on mechanical properties

Figure 4.6 shows the average tensile shear and cross tension strength versus tempering time. The tensile shear strength was calculated as the maximum load divided by the cross-sectional area
1

i4nd2 (where d is nugget diameter) and cross-tension strength was calculated as the maximum

load divided by the circumference nd and thickness t (where tis thickness of sheet). From Figure 4.6 it can be seen that, as the tempering time increases, the tensile shear and cross tension strength decrease.

Effect of tempering time on tensile shear and cross tension strength in DP600 spot welds.

63

The reason for this is that as the tempering time increases, the hardness decreases, and consequently the strength decreases It was also observed that the tensile shear stress is higher than the cross tension stress since a spot weld under cross-tension load fails at a lower load than a spot weld under a lap shear load [58, 42].

4.1.8

Effect of shrinkage voids on mechanical properties

Figure 4.7 shows the change in the tensile shear and cross tension stresses with hold time. There is a minor increase in both the tensile shear and cross tension stresses with increasing hold times. Similar results have been reported by Ghosh eta!. [59]. This increase in stress is related to the increase in hardness with increasing hold time, as shown in Figure 4.8. It is known that the load bearing capacity of spot welds depends upon the effective nugget area [29] and so the volume fraction of shrinkage voids should also influence the tensile shear and cross tension stresses. However, the change in the effective nugget area as a function of hold time is very small (Figure 4.5). To understand the increase in hardness with increase in hold time, the volume of transformed martensite needs to be considered. The martensitic transformation proceeds only during rapid cooling and ceases if this rapid cooling is interrupted [60]. Hence, when the hold time is increased, the cooling rate is also increased resulting in more austenite transforming to martensite.

Fracture surface analysis

Figure 4.9 shows mixed modes of failure, i.e., shear as well as ductile behaviour, in the welded sample without tempering after tensile shear test, and the mixed mode failure is due to the high hardness of the nugget. Figure 4.10 shows a ductile mode of fracture with a characteristic dimple-like surface in the sample after tempering after tensile shear test, and the fracture indicates low hardness of the nugget as compared to that in Figure 4.9. Interfacial fractures in nuggets having different hold times of 0, 5, 15 and 30 cycles are shown in Figure 4.11 (a) to (d), respectively. The nugget with a hold time of 30 cycles (Figure 4.11 (d)) exhibits an interfacial fracture in spite of very small voids.

Resistance spot welding of HSLA350 steel

4.2.1

Microstructure

The micrographs shown in Figures 4.12 and 4.13 are representative of those found in the base metal, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and the fusion zone (FZ). The fusion zone is predominantly martensitic with some bainite, as shown in Figure 4.12 (e) and (f). The transition region between the fusion zone and HAZ is shown in Figure 4.12 (d). The martensite micro-constituent decreases from the fusion zone towards the base metal. This is due to the fact that austenitization was incomplete in the HAZ, and even when austenite formed, grain growth was restricted by the formation of martensite and thermal cycles. The HAZ near the base metal as shown in Figure 4.12 (c) exhibited ferrite and tempered martensite.

4.2.2

Microhardness

Figure 4.14 shows the microhardness profile of the HSLA 350 steel nugget. The nugget profile shows a significant hardness increase from the base metal to fusion zone. Due to the chemical composition of the steel and the high cooling rate, the hardness of the weld nugget is about twice that of the base metal. The much higher hardness, and the resulting YS and UTS [53, 54] in the weld nugget are mainly attributed to the formation of martensite and bainite, as shown in Figure 4.12 (e) and (f).

Welding imperfections

Examination of the welds showed that they were free of shrinkage voids and cold cracking as shown in the Figure 4.12 (a).

4.2.4

Welding behaviour

To characterize the welding behaviour of the steel, the useful welding current range and static weld tensile and cross tension properties are important. The current range is useful because it provides a range of welding current over which the welds with buttons of acceptable size can be produced. In this study, a wide welding-current range of 2. 7 kA was established with a weld time of 18 cycles. The different current values from are given in the Appendix A2.

4.2.5

Effect of welding current on nugget diameter

Figure 4.15 shows that, as the welding current increases, the nugget diameter increases. According to Equation 2.1, the heat Q generated in resistance spot welding depends on the current (A), time (s) and the resistance (Q), which includes the bulk resistance of the material

and the resistance of the electrode/material and material/material interfaces between sheets and electrodes. An increase in any of the above parameters results in an increase of the heat generated and should result in an increase in the size of the weld nugget as well. The parameter that exerts the strongest effect on the characteristics and properties of the nugget is the welding

71

current [26] as shown in Figure 4.15. It can be seen that as the welding current increases, the average nugget diameter also increases up to about 8.3 kA and then decreases due to expulsion [27].

4.2.6

Effect of welding current on tensile properties

Tensile shear tests were carried out to measure the load bearing capacity of the spot welds. Figure 4.16 shows the fracture load as a function of welding current. It can be seen that, with increasing weld current, the maximum load sustained by the spot welded joints increases up to 8.4 kA, after which it decreases due to excessive melting and splashes. This enhancement in tensile shear load-bearing capacity of weldment is primarily attributed to the enlargement of the

72

nugget with increase in current [61]. Eight of the ten points exhibited button-pull out failure while two points (with solid boxes) exhibited interfacial fracture. To obtain a button pull-out failure, the fracture should start in the HAZ, indicating that the HAZ hardness plays an important role in determining the mode of failure [56, 57]. The data from the present experiments on HSLA steel were applied to Equation (4.1) developed by Marya eta!. [14] and the results are shown in Table 4.2. The fracture modes observed experimentally are in agreement with those predicted by Equation (4.1 ). The computed value of the critical diameter de of the experimental weld with 5.5 mm diameter is much higher than its actual diameter, and the critical diameter value for 7.5 mm nugget is less than its actual diameter. The HAZ hardness ratio Hmax1Hmin is smaller for the 5.5 mm diameter nugget as compared to the 7.5 mm diameter nugget. This is because as the nugget diameter decreases the cooling rate increases and more austenite is converted to martensite and a higher hardness [60].

The observed tensile shear strength is higher than the cross tension strength (Figure 4.17). Chao [58] carried out a detailed study of these two types of tests and the stresses generated leading to failure. He showed that, in the tensile shear test, because of rotation of the lap welded joint with respect to the loading axis, the failure mechanism of the lap shear sample at the material level is tensile. In the same way, through SEM, Chao showed that, in the cross tension test, the fracture surface exhibits elongated or fish scale dimples indicating a ductile and shear fracture mechanism at the material level.

CHAPTER FIVE

Results and Discussion for Dissimilar Sheet Welding

This chapter describes the results and discussion on dissimilar spot welds between galvannealed DP600 and HSLA350. The focus of the current discussion is on the microstructure, welding behaviour, mechanical properties and fracture characteristics of dissimilar materials spot welds.

5.1

Microstructure

The micrographs shown in Figure 5.1 represent variations in the microstructure of a dissimilar spot weld nugget from the base metal, across the heat-affected zone (HAZ) to the fusion zone (FZ). The volume fraction of martensite in the HAZ near BM and HAZ near the fusion zone (FZ) of the DP side was higher as compared to the HAZ of HSLA side, as shown in Figures 5.1 (f) and (g). This is because of the fact that the DP steel has higher amount of Cas compared to the HSLA steel (0.1% and 0.05%, respectively). The fusion zone is predominantly martensitic with some bainite, as shown in Figures 5.1 (d) and 4 (h). The transition regions between the fusion zone and HAZ are shown in Figures 5.1 (c) and 4 (g) .The microconstituents with martensite, bainite and ferrite in the HAZ were finer than in the FZ. This is due to the fact that austenitizing was incomplete in the HAZ, and even when austenite grains formed, grain growth was restricted by the formation of martensite and bainite, and because of the thermal cycles [50-52].

77

5.2

Microhardness

Figure 5.2 shows the microhardness profiles of the DP/DP, the HSLA/HSLA and the HSLA/DP resistance spot welded nuggets. The hardness of the HSLA/DP combination weld nugget is inbetween the hardness of the similar material combination nuggets. According to the following Carbon Equivalent (CE) formula [62],
Si Mn+Cu+Cr Ni Mo V B CE = C +-+ +-+-+-+ 30 20 60 15 10

(5.1)

CE's of the DP steel and the HSLA steel are 0.208 and 0.141, respectively. The higher carbon equivalent of the DP steel makes the microstructure more martensitic and harder as compared to the HSLA steel. It is believed that the effect of HSLA steel was to dilute the DP steel and reduce its hardenability, as can be seen from the hardness profile of the HSLA/DP nugget. Thus, the final composition of the HSLA/DP nugget will be a combination of the two steels. The difference in the peak HAZ hardness of the HSLA/DP nugget is an indication of the difference in hardenability between the base metals. Similar results have been reported by Hernandez et al. [4] for the Trip/HSLA combination. The higher hardness in the weld nuggets is attributed to the formation of martensite, as shown in Figure 5.1.

5.3

Welding imperfections

Voids were observed in the centre of the welds, as shown in Figure 5.3 (a) and (b).These voids are more commonly called shrinkage voids because they are formed during solidification of the molten nugget and have a dendritic morphology. They are formed in heavier gauge material

78

and/or material with richer chemistry. The hold time and the electrode force are important factors which can help to reduce the shrinkage voids [50, 21 , 63 and 64].

5.4

Welding behaviour

Figure 5.4 shows the welding current ranges of the dissimilar and the similar materials combinations. The HSLA/DP combination exhibited a different welding behaviour than the similar materials combinations. It can be seen from Figure 5.4 that the HSLA/HSLA combination has a wider welding current range as compared to the DP/DP combination. The difference in the welding current ranges is due to the bulk electrical resistivity of each combination. This difference in the bulk electrical resistivity is mainly due to differences in the chemistry of the materials, especially in Si which has the highest elemental electrical resistivity [65]. The DP steel has a higher Si content as compared to the HSLA steel (0.19% and 0.052 %, respectively), and hence a higher bulk electrical resistivity than the HSLA steel. The higher resistivity of the DP steel produces a smaller corona during welding than the HSLA steel, and so the DP steel is less able to contain the molten nugget before expulsion occurs.

To understand the difference in the welding behaviour of the three combinations, the static and dynamic resistances need to be considered. The static resistance is defined as the surface resistance of the materials which dictates the current required to initiate heat for welding. As heat develops at the faying surfaces, the dynamic resistance takes over and depends on electrode pressure and substrate resistivity [66]. If we compare the electrical behaviour of the similar and dissimilar materials combinations, the DP/DP combination has higher static and dynamic resistance than the HSLA/HSLA combination. In the case of the HSLA/DP combination, the top HSLA sheet offers less resistance than the bottom DP sheet, giving higher static resistance than the HSLA/HSLA combination but smaller than the DP/DP combination. Once melting begins,

80

the small molten pool becomes a mixture of the two base metals and exhibits a different dynamic resistance than either of the similar materials combinations. Hence, the minimum acceptable button diameter for the DP/DP combination was obtained at a welding current of 5.89 kA and expulsion was observed at 7.35 kA, while, for the HSLA/HSLA combination, the minimum acceptable button diameter was formed at a welding current of 6.36 kA and expulsion was seen at a welding current of 9.01 kA. In the case of the HSLA/DP combination, the minimum acceptable button diameter was formed at a welding current of 6.01 kA and expulsion was at a welding current of 7.81 kA. Thus, the HSLA/DP combination exhibited a welding current range of 1. 78 kA, which is considered to be sufficient for automotive applications [66].

Effect of welding current on nugget diameter

Figure 5.5 shows the increase of the nugget diameter with welding current for the similar and dissimilar materials combinations spot welds. The increase in the nugget diameter with increase in welding current is due to more melting of the base metals caused by higher heat generated at the interface of the sheets due to higher welding current, and the decrease of the nugget diameter beyond this current is because of expulsion taking place, as discussed in section 4.2.4. From Figure 5.5, it can be seen that the minimum button formation and expulsion current values are different for the similar and dissimilar materials combinations spot welds. This is because of the difference in bulk electrical resistivity of each combination, as discussed above in section 5.4.

5.6

Tensile properties

Figure 5.6 shows the tensile shear failure load vs. welding current for the three combinations. It can be seen that, as the welding current increases, the failure load also increases. Similar results have been reported by Aslanlar et al. [67]. This enhancement in tensile shear load-bearing capacity of the weldment is primarily attributed to the enlargement of the nugget with increase in current [61]. For a nugget size of7.5 mm and at the same cross-head speed, the failure loads are 19.3 kN, 18.9 kN and 15.6 kN for the DP/DP, HSLA/DP and HSLA/HSLA spot welds, respectively. The difference in failure loads for the different combinations at the same nugget size and cross-head speed is due to the differences in the microstructures, which influences the micro hardness, as discussed in section 5 .2, which in steels is proportional to the ultimate tensile strength [53] and the yield strength [54]. In the case of the HSLA/HSLA and HSLA/DP spot welds, interfacial fractures were observed at the lower welding currents. The mode of failure changed from interfacial fracture to button pull-out failure as the welding current was increased. This is likely because the smaller nugget has less energy absorption capacity than the larger nugget [68]. However, the DP/DP combination exhibited interfacial fracture at all current levels, the details of which are given in section 4.1.6.

The fracture surfaces shown in Figure 5. 7 are in agreement with this result. The fracture surface of the DP/DP spot weld represented by Figure 5.7 (a) shows a shear as well as ductile mode of failure because of high hardness of the nugget. The fracture surfaces of the HSLA/DP and HSLA/HSLA spot welds show ductile mode of failure, as shown in Figures 5.7 (b) and (c) which indicate low hardness of the nuggets.

Cross-tension properties

Figure 5.8 represents the failure load in cross-tension as a function of welding current for HSLA/DP spot welds. It can be seen that, as the welding current increases, the failure load also increases. This enhancement in cross-tension load-bearing capacity of the weldment is primarily attributed to the enlargement of the nugget with increase in welding current as discussed above in section 5. 5.

Two different modes of failure were observed, viz, interfacial button-pullout and button-pullout. At the lower welding current corresponding to a smaller nugget diameter, the mode of failure was interfacial button-pullout, and the nugget stayed in the HSLA sheet, as shown in Figures 5.9 (a) and (b). At the higher welding current, the mode of failure was button-pullout and the nugget stayed in the DP sheet, as shown in Figures 5.9 (c) and (d). This is because, as the nugget diameter decreases, the cooling rate increases and the microstructure become more martensitic, increasing the hardness [60], as shown in Figure 5.10 for 7.5 mm and 5.5 mm nuggets. It has been reported that, as the hardness increases, the fracture toughness decreases [69].

In HSLA/DP combination spot welds, the nugget hardness on the DP side is higher as compared to the HSLA side. This difference in hardness is greater for smaller nugget diameters as compared to larger nugget diameters, as shown in Figure 5.1 0. That is why the smaller nugget exhibited interfacial button-pullout failure, and the nugget separated from the DP sheet. These results are further verified from an analysis of the fracture surfaces of the failed samples, as shown in Figures 5.11 and 5.12. Figure 5.11 represents the SEM micrographs of a failed sample of the HSLA/DP spot weld with a 5.5 mm nugget diameter. Figure 5.11 shows two kinds of fracture; at the top of the nugget, the mode of failure is shear (Figure 5.11(b)) and, at the root of the nugget, it is a mixed mode of failure, i.e., cleavage and ductile (Figure 5.11(c)).

Figure 5.12 represents the SEM micrographs of a failed sample of the HSLA/DP spot weld with a 7.5 mm nugget diameter. The mode of failure at the top and the root of the nugget is ductile, as

88

shown in Figures 5.12(b) and (c). Similar results have been reported by Sun et al. [19], viz., as the fusion zone size decreases, the mode of failure become interfacial.

Figure 5.13 shows a comparison of the cross-tension failure loads of the similar and dissimilar materials combinations at the 7.5 mm nugget diameter for the same cross-head speed. The difference in failure loads is mainly due to differences in the microstructure, as discussed in sections 5.2 and 5.6. The observed tensile shear strength was higher than the cross tension strength. In the tensile shear test, because of rotation of the lap welded joint with respect to the loading axis, the failure mechanism of the lap shear sample at the material level is tensile. In the same way, in the cross tension test, the fracture surface exhibits elongated or fish scale dimples indicating a ductile and shear fracture mechanism at the material level [58, 42].

Fatigue properties

One of the important aspects of the current discussion is the fatigue performance of dissimilar materials spot welds. In tensile shear geometry, the shear stresses act along the cross-section of the spot-weld nugget. Thus, the state of stress in a spot-welded joint is given by Equation (5 .2) [70] (5.2) where, D is diameter of the nugget (mm) and F is the applied load (N). The load amplitude versus cycles to failure data were converted to stress amplitude versus cycles to failure by

90

calculating the shear stress using Equation (5.2). The following Basquin type equation was used for curve fitting of the fatigue data

(5.3)
~r

where

I 2 is shear stress amplititude, rj is shear fatigue strength coefficient, b is fatigue

strength exponent and 2N 1 is number of reversals to failure. The values of b and rj for 7.5 mm and 5.5 mm nugget sizes with different R values are given in Table 5.1. Figure 5.14 shows the shear stress-amplitude versus 2N 1 curves for the 7.5 mm and 5.5 mm diameter nuggets of the dissimilar spot welds in HSLA/DP. It can be seen that, as the shear stress amplitude decreases, the number of cycles to failure increases for both groups. The 5.5 mm diameter nugget exhibited higher fatigue strength (stress) than the 7. 5 mm diameter nugget, because, as the nugget diameter decreases, the cooling rate increases and the microstructure becomes more martensitic, increasing the hardness of the nugget (as discussed earlier in section 5. 7).

Three distinctive failure modes were identified in these tests, and representative photographs of fractured welds are presented in Figure 5.15 for the tensile-shear configuration. These failure modes were correlated to distinct features of the fatigue curves in Figure 5.14. Type I

91

corresponds to the region I in Figure 5.14, Type II corresponds to the region II in Figure 5.14, and Type III corresponds to the region III in Figure 5.14, long-life portion of the curve. At high loads, in Type I behaviour, the final failure is essentially an overload failure. Additionally, for Type I failures, a small decrease in load results in a relatively large increase in life. In Type II behaviour, the crack fully penetrated the thickness of the sheet. When the crack fully penetrated the thickness, the weld was less constrained and various rotations of the weld occurred. In the tensile-shear sample, the weld rotates slightly out of plane due to eccentricity of loading applied to the partially attached button. The weld rotation increases the component of Mode I loading (i.e., crack-opening mode) at the fatigue crack tip and correspondingly increases the triaxiality of the stress state at the crack tip, thereby further increasing the crack growth rate. In Type III behaviour, the loads are much lower and crack is initiated in the HAZ near edge and crack growth is strongly influenced by microstructure and mean stress and as much as 90% of the fatigue life may be consumed in initiating a viable fatigue crack .Crack penetration into HSLA sheet occurs as a result of the difference in microstructure and reduction in the triaxiality at the crack tip as compared to Type II behaviour. Thus the crack is not as strongly driven to propagate around the weld button and branches into the base material in response to the nominally applied stress. The crack is aligned perpendicular to the applied tensile stress in the sheet [34].

Fatigue crack initiation

Cracks normally initiate at the edge of the nugget or in the HAZ, as shown in Figure 5.16. The opening between the two sheets in the nugget area is seen as an initial crack due to the stress concentration [62], as shown in Figure 5.16 (a). The boundary of the weld nugget near the opening was also weakly bonded and relatively brittle, likely from the molten zinc coating, as shown in Figure 5.16 (b). SEM observations showed that cracks initiated at the boundary and at the HAZ of HSLA/DP spot weld nuggets, and then the cracks penetrated through the thickness and propagated to the outer surface, as shown in Figures 5.17-5.19.

5.8.2

Effect of stress ratio on fatigue properties

Figures 5.20-5.22 show the effect of stress ratio on the fatigue strength of different nugget sizes.
It can be seen that, at any given stress level, the samples with R = 0.1 exhibited a higher number

of cycles to failure (higher fatigue strength) as compared to samples with R = 0.5. Similar results have been reported by Pan et a!. [71]. As the stress ratio R increases from 0.1 to 0. 5, the mean stress also increases, and the number of cycles to initiate a crack decreases with the increase of mean stress [72, 73].

Comparisons with published spot weld fatigue data

Figure 5.23 shows a comparison of fatigue data of the present dissimilar material combination HSLA/DP with similar material combinations of HSLA/HSLA and DP/DP from published literature [34, 74]. It can be seen that curves for the dissimilar combination are lower than those for the DP/DP combination, but very close to those for the HSLA/HSLA combination, because the HSLA steel has lower tensile strength as compared to the DP steel [75]. Similar results have been reported by Weber and Goklu [76] showing that the duration of fatigue crack propagation for spot welded AHSS is higher than for the spot welded mild steel sheet of lower strength.

Conclusions and Future Work

6.1

Conclusions

1. Fusion zone (FZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ) microstructures for similar and dissimilar

materials combinations were martensitic, with varying amounts of martensite in the HAZ and lath martensite and bainite in the FZ because of very high cooling rates.

2. At similar welding conditions the smaller nugget exhibited higher hardness than the larger nugget because of increased cooling rate for smaller nugget as compared to the larger nugget.

3. In tensile shear geometry the mode of failure depends on the HAZ hardness ratio Hmax to Hmin. If this ratio is large enough, then the material will fail via a button pull-out mechanism because it will facilitate the development of plastic strains in the HAZ instead of the harder fusion zone. Conversely, if this ratio is small, the weld will fail via interfacial fracture. If the microstructure becomes more martensitic, this ratio becomes smaller as in case of DP/DP spot welds and smaller diameter nuggets for HSLA/HSLA and HSLA/DP spot welds.

100

4. The DP600 properties played a dominating role on the weldability, hardness and mechanical properties of the dissimilar material spot welds HSLA/DP. However, the fatigue performance of the dissimilar welds was similar to that of the HSLA spot welds.

5. The welding current range of HSLA/DP combination was in between the similar material combinations.

6. At a given stress amplitude, the number of cycles to failure were higher for 5.5 mm diameter nugget than the 7.5 mm diameter nugget. At very high stress levels, the fracture was either interfacial failure, or initiated in the HAZ near the nugget and failed with some plastic deformation. At intermediate stress levels, the cracks initiated at the nugget boundary and propagated along the circumference and finally into the base metal. At very low stress levels, the cracks basically initiated at the nugget boundary, penetrated through the thickness and propagated along a straight line in the base metal in a direction normal to the loading axis.

7. An increase in the stress ratio decreased the fatigue strength of both the 7.5 mm and 5.5 mm diameter nuggets.

8. Fatigue performance of the dissimilar materials HSLA/DP spot welds was similar to that of the HSLA/HSLA spot welds.

Based on the above conclusions, it seems that the performance of the dissimilar materials spot welds is satisfactory for field applications.

101

6.2

Recommendations for future work

1. This work dealt with the resistance spot welding between dissimilar materials HSLA350 and DP600 having similar sheet thickness. Studies are needed to investigate the resistance spot weldability of dissimilar materials with different thickness.

2. Detailed study of nugget formation between dissimilar materials spot welds with similar and dissimilar sheet thicknesses would be of great interest.

3. The effect of the electrode force on tensile shear strength, fatigue performance and mode of failure of dissimilar materials spot welds is also important.
