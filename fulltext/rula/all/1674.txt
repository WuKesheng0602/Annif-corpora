ABSTRACT

The Personal Albums of Samuel Bourne at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the National Media Museum, Master of Arts, 2009, Julienne Pascoe, Photographic Preservation and Collections Management, Ryerson University.

This paper analyzes a group of seven photographic albums belonging to the personal collection of British photographer Samuel Bourne ( 1834 - 1912), which are now split between two public collections, the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Canada, and the Royal Photographic Society at the National Media Museum in Bradford, England. The project includes: contextual research on Bourne's commercial practice and nineteenthcentury colonial photography in India, an extensive literature survey discussing both primary and contemporary sources on Bourne and colonial photography, documentation of the albums' history and provenance, and a detailed analysis of the organization and contents of the albums as a complete and coherent record of Bourne's photographic achievement in India. Furthermore, the applied component of the project, which entailed the substantial documentation of all seven albums, in the form of a catalogue of their 705 albumen prints, is included as an appendix. The paper also describes the collections management strategies used to reunite the collection and facilitate future access and research.

SECTION I. INTRODUCTION

The set of seven photographic albums from the personal collection of Samuel Bourne (1834 - 1912) provides important insight into nineteenth century colonialist photography in India. These albums, which have become divided between two public collections, the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in Toronto, Canada, and the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) at the National Media Museum in Bradford, England, form a complete collection assembled by Bourne, a commercial photographer working in India during the 1860s. This study examines the organization, contents, and significance of these albums. This research comes at a time when there has been an increasing amount of interest in Samuel Bourne and nineteenth century colonialist photography. Bourne's commercial practice in the 1860s covers an important period in colonial photography in India, and sheds light on Anglo-Indian 1 relationships in the late nineteenth century. Although researchers had previously known and have had access to the four albums at the RPS, 2 there had not been any substantial documentation of them or of their connection to the related three albums now at the AGO. The relationship of all the albums as a collection including their provenance, physical characteristics and arrangement, had not been fully investigated or studied. Thus an essential component of the project was the complete

The term Anglo-Indian refers to people of British descent living in India. The modern use ofthe word means people of British and Indian descent, however during the colonial period and in this particular context it relates to the British colonial communities that developed within India. 2 During research at the National Media Museum, I came across correspondents between researchers seeking access to the albums.

cataloguing of all seven albums, 705 prints in total, which revealed key aspects of the collection, including its organization and connection to Bourne's career. In compiling documentation and research on the albums, this thesis also applies collections management strategies to reconnect these albums by providing information for each institution to understand the portion that it has. The main sections of this paper include: I. Contextual research on Bourne's photography and commercial practice in India; II. Analysis of scholarly studies on Bourne and his career; Ill. Notes on the catalogue and methodology used in documenting the albums; IV. The provenance and history of the albums; V . Comparison and analysis of the collection; and VI. Conclusion, including a discussion of collections management strategies utilized and the outcome of the project. Included in the thesis are four appendices: Appendix A. Illustrations; Appendix B. Auction Records for the Bourne Albums; Appendix C. The Outline of Bourne's Travels in India; Appendix D. The Bourne Albums Print Catalogue. Through cataloguing each print, compiling documentation on the entire set along with contextual analysis of the albums, the project has constructed a tangible identity for the collection in relationship to Bourne's career. Further contribution to understanding Bourne's work has been made throughout the project, for instance in the analysis of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue, along with clarifications in the dating of Bourne's prints. In bringing together and analyzing the complete set of seven albums, this thesis forms a valuable resource on both Samuel Bourne and colonial photography in nineteenth century India.

SECTION II. THE COMMERCIAL PRACTICE OF SAMUEL BOURNE

Bourne was an influential British commercial photographer who photographed colonial India in the 1860s. His work was part of the expansion of the British Empire and its employment of photography to extend what is now defined as the colonial gaze. Bourne's photographic practice was part of a commercial enterprise, the firm of Bourne and Shepherd, for which he provided landscape and architectural views directed at an English clientele. In accordance to previous traditions of representing colonial landscapes, Bourne's work was guided by an imperial picturesque, in which he applied English notions of pictorial organization and subject matter to representing the Indian landscape. In providing views for a British audience, Bourne not only capitalized on a colonial preoccupation with India, but also created an extensive record of the Indian landscape during a decade of its colonial period. Along with the commercial considerations that informed Bourne's selection and composition of views, Bourne was also at heart a Victorian photographer who sought to authenticate his experiences through photography and the creation of a series of views. 3 Both of these factors, the commercial and the personal, along with the social and political context of documenting India during its colonial period, must be considered in analyzing and understanding Bourne's work. Upon his arrival in India in January 1863, Bourne quickly set up a commercial enterprise that would emerge as a leading provider of views of the Indian subcontinent to an English clientele. Bourne's arrival in India was both timely and purposeful. The Indian Mutiny of 1857-58, which ended in the British government's assumption of colonial rule

from the East India Company, resulted in an increased appetite for views of an exotic India, specifically views related to imperial rule. Having been in England during the events of the late 1850s, Bourne would have been aware of an increasing desire for views of India, particularly those that referred to the recent events and that validated Britain's domination over its Indian subjects. Bourne quickly established a photographic studio in Simla, chosen specifically for its location as an important Anglo-Indian British hill station. As Gary Sampson, now Associate Dean at the Cleveland Institute of Art, discusses in his 1992 article on Bourne's career m India, "Simla was socially and politically the most important of the hill stations, located at 7000 feet in the Himalayas ... Bourne's firm thus became part of the Simla community at a high moment in its political and economic history." In establishing his commercial practice, Bourne first formed a partnership with a man named Howard. Charles Shepherd (active in India, 1850s 1870s), having recently dissolved his firm "Shepherd and Robertson", quickly joined Howard and Bourne soon after the studio was established in November 1863. 5 The firm operated extremely efficiently, with Shepherd concentrating on studio portraits and ethnographic studies, Bourne contributing landscapes and architecture, and Howard conducting the printing and business affairs. It was through this effective partnership, that Bourne, within six months of his arrival in India, was able to begin his travels through Northern India. In July 1863, Bourne embarked on his first excursion into the wild and uncharted domain of the Himalayas. This important trip was the first of three extensive explorations

into the area made in 1863, 1864, and 1866, during which Bourne, using a large format wet-plate camera, produced an extensive record of these high-altitude landscapes. Throughout these travels Bourne wrote a series of articles for the British Journal of

Photography (BJP), '"Photography in the East", '"Ten Weeks with the Camera in the
Himalayas", "Narrative of a Photographic Journey to Kashmir and Adjacent Districts", and "A Photographic Journey through the Higher Himalayas". 7 These articles provide valuable insight into Bourne's colonial perspective on his travels. James R. Ryan, lecturer in the School of Geography at the University of Oxford, discusses the colonial context of Bourne's extensive treks into the Himalayas, "Far from being incidental to a wandering search for the picturesque, they were exercises in imperial assertion which directly correlated with Bourne's aesthetic preoccupations." 8 Implicit in Bourne's artistic motivations and aesthetics was an underlying imperial ideology, which as Ryan discusses infonned his expeditions and photographic practice. 9 Not only did Bourne's reflections on his journeys throughout the Himalayas serve marketing purposes by increasing awareness of the firm's stock of images, but they also fulfilled Bourne's more personal desire to communicate his experiences and discoveries. Throughout the BJP articles, Bourne discusses the many technical limitations of his photographic materials in adequately rendering the Himalayas and distant mountains. For instance, during his travels in the Kashmir district in 1864, Bourne wrote: "But while I yield to none in admiration of the finest productions of photography, I cannot help remarking (and those who have had experience with the camera in

mountainous country will bear me out in the assertion) that it fails more or less in the rendering of distances and mountains - the former appearing much too hazy and indistinct, the latter unnaturally dwindled down and distant. This remark of course does not apply to mountains which are close to the camera." 10 While Bourne continued to encounter difficulties in representing distances, he experimented with the capabilities of the materials, resulting in approaches that influenced the aesthetics and final appearance of his work. As Sampson argues, "Yet the very same frustrations challenged him to expand the expressive possibilities of the medium through the production of subtly varied and interrelated sets of images of a specific place or object." 11 In overcoming the limitations of the medium to convey his own pictorial experiences of India, Bourne used different sized plates and inter-related views of a site. 12 Although Bourne is best known for his famous three excursions in the Himalayas, he also created a significant record of many architectural monuments and hill stations throughout India. In catering to a British clientele, Bourne sought out specific locations that held cultural and historical significance. Bourne was aware that the Anglo-European public would buy images aesthetically appealing in their familiar, picturesque style while also portraying popular landmarks of very recent colonial history. His views follow a depoliticized picturesque aesthetic and present idyllic, tamed colonial scenery, reflecting a cultural and colonial desire to control a resisting India. As John Falconer, Jerwood

Curator of Photography at the British Library and an authority on 19th century Indian photography, 13 wrote in 2001, one can "interpret Bourne's unease with the threatening immensity of India, and the consequent need to order it within a rigid compositional framework of trees, water and human figures for scale, as an implicit and telling image of a wider desire to reinforce imperial control of the subcontinent."
14

Throughout his travels

through India, Bourne focused on landscapes that captured the British imagination while subjecting the 'exotic' landscape to the picturesque aesthetic. While Bourne targeted specific locations that would appeal directly to a British clientele, the practice of Bourne and Shepherd established methods of marketing and disseminating their growing inventory of Indian views. The develop1nent and publication of several editions of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue was a crucial selling tool, whereby clients could order either single images or a group of inter-related views that represented a site from different vantage points, and thereby would convey a sense of place. 15 Photographs could be ordered by negative nmnber directly from the Bourne and Shepherd studios 16 or at various agencies throughout India.
17

By 1870 an important

professional connection was also made with the French publishers A. Marion and Company. 18 In creating this important business affiliation, Bourne and Shepherd aligned

Later versions of their catalogue would be issued in 1867, 1877, 1885 and c. 1910. (For a complete listing of the firm's catalogues see the Bibliography section) 16 Bourne and Shepherd studios were opened up in Simla (1863), Calcutta (1867), and Bombay (1870). 17 According to Sampson, in 1866, W . Newman & Co. became the sole agents in Calcutta for the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue of views, with other agencies to follow in the main cities ofBombay, Lucknow, Agra, Allahabad, Murree, Meean Meer, Mussoorie, and Madras.

themselves with a prestigious European publisher that had international distribution connections. 19 Bourne capitalized on the potential of the photographic album as a form particularly suited to presenting and disseminating his views. The photographic album, through its ability to reconstruct pictorial experience and narratives through a sequential layout, was the ideal form for presenting Bourne's series of views. Sampson discusses this point in his analysis of Bourne's commercial success, "That Bourne valued the album concept beyond any remunerative significance is evident from his providing the option to select from numerous interrelated series of images of a specific locale or subject, often with slightest variation in vantage point. "
2

Â° Further evidence of Bourne's recognition of

the importance of the album format can be seen in the set of seven albums that comprise his personal collection. The arrangement of these albums, in which inter-related views and series are grouped together, reflects his understanding of the photographic album for organizing and presenting his work. These albums, through their relationship as a coherent collection arranged by Bourne, form an ideal example with which to understand Bourne's commercial and personal intentions as a colonial photographer.

SECTION III. LITERATURE SURVEY

There are a number of primary documents originating during Bourne's lifetime that provide direct evidence of his intentions and ideas along with the context in which his work in India was created, understood, and received. The first publications on Bourne's photography were the series of articles Bourne wrote to the British Journal of Photography (BJP) beginning with his first trek in the Himalayas in 1863, "Ten Weeks with the Camera in the Himalayas", continuing with his second trip to Kashmir in 1864, "Narrative of a Photographic Trip to Kashmir and Adjacent Districts", and relating his experiences from his final trek in 1869, "A Photographic Journey through the Higher Himalayas". These essays provide considerable insight into Bourne's perspective and expenences. During the 1860s, there were also discussions of Bourne's work in the publications generated by the main photographic societies in both England and India. While working in India, Bourne was an avid supporter of and participant in the many photographic societies, which in turn recognized his work and popularized his views through their publications. 21 Bourne retired from commercial photography in 1870, but continued as an amateur photographer and watercolorist as well as a businessman. His work in India fell into obscurity at this point, although there were some references to his Indian photography in the local press at the time of his death. Serious academic study of his career would not begin until a hundred years after his departure from India. In the 1970s there was renewed interest in colonial photography, including the work of Bourne. In 197 4, Ray Desmond, who was then Deputy Librarian at the India

Office Library and Records in London, began the first of many studies on Bourne with his article, "Photography in India in the Nineteenth Century". This article provided a model with which to understand the development of photography in British India, and included a section on Bourne, bringing the photographer back into prominence. Desmond's work on colonial photography is frequently cited in subsequent studies. Further re-examinations of Bourne's work included Roger Taylor's 1980 publication,

Samuel Bourne i834-i9i2: Photographic Views in india, which accompanied an
exhibition at the Sheffield City Polytechnic, and Susan Williams 1981 exhibition catalogue, Samuel Bourne: in Search of the Picturesque. These two publications were some of the earliest to focus on Bourne's work in detail, further renewing interest in this overlooked photographer. Throughout the 1980s, further research on Bourne and colonial photography occurred, including Arthur Oilman's significant study, Samuel Bourne:

Images of India, published by the Friends of Photography in 1983. While these
publications were important in reconsidering Bourne's work, these studies were limited by the lack of previous scholarly research on Bourne and colonial photography. It should be noted that the discourse on colonial photography has developed considerably over the past decades as new analytical studies have focused on this historical period, altering critical approaches to the subject. Furthermore, while researchers had access to the BJP articles, and used them extensively, they did not appear to have easy access to the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogues, and thus could not completely analyze the full body of his work or understand the structure of his career. Publications from the 1970s and early 1980s focused mainly on the photographer's well-known travels throughout the Himalayas, tying in excerpts from the BJP articles. 22 Nonetheless, these early
22

Further evidence of Oilman's concentration on Bourne's work in the Himalayas can be seen his 1983

10

examinations of Bourne and his relationship to nineteenth-century Colonial photography in India established the foundation for subsequent research. The 1990s brought an increase in extensive analytical research on both Bourne's career and colonial photography, most notably in the form of Gary Sampson's (Ph.D., University of California-Santa Barbara) dissertation in 1991, Samuel Bourne and 19th -

Century British Landscape Photography in india. This dissertation along with a series of
articles Sampson subsequently wrote formed a significant critical discussion of Bourne's work in context of the social and political climate of photographing India during its colonial period. His dissertation also included important research concerning the exact dates and locations for his three treks, along with a comprehensive chronology, which has been invaluable in dating Bourne's work. 23 Throughout his publications, Sampson includes detailed analysis of his lesser known, albeit important work in the many cities and hill stations he documented, including research into his interrelated series of architecture and government parks. Sampson's article "The Success of Samuel Bourne in India" ( 1992) is a valuable resource on the commercial operations of Bourne and Shepherd. This fundamental research has provided an understanding of the underlying social motivations and intentions that frame Bourne's work. In 2001, Hugh Rayner, professional photographer and collector of colonial photography, assembled and re-published Bourne's BJP essays along with the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue. 24 Hugh Rayner's publication, Photographic Journeys in the

article in Creative Camera 226, "Samuel Bourne, The Himalayan Images, 1863-69." 23 In constructing the chronology, Sampson mentions using the British Journal ofPhotography articles, the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogues for 1866 and 1870, and numerous items in the English-language Indian press of the period. 24 According to Rayner, the republished version of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue was constructed from: "a. A 2nd or 3rd generation photocopy of an original 1860's catalogue that was republished by Howard Rickets in the 1970's. B. A photocopy of a 1920's B&S catalogue that I obtained from the studio in

11

Himalayas, has been extremely useful in providing access to significant primary material,
most notably the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue. 25 While the original Bourne and Shepherd Catalogues (see full listings in bibliography) are crucial to understanding and contextualizing Bourne's work, they have not been easily accessible. Rayner throughout his research and many travels to India, including a visit to the Calcutta Bourne and Shepherd studio, was able to acquire copies of the original catalogues and edit them into a readily available fonnat. Rayner's publication was essential for this thesis project since the republished version of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue together with Bourne's

BJP articles and Sampson's research provided the starting point to the approach and
investigation of the albums. 26 The increasing scholarly interest in academic circles in colonial photography has led to exhibitions in this subject area and an increasing body of literature. In its discussion of the ideologies of the British Empire and the implementation of photography throughout the colonies, James R. Ryan's 1997 publication, Picturing Empire:

Photography and the Visualization of the British Empire deserves special mention as a
vital resource for placing Bourne's career within a larger imperial context. Of note is also C.A. Bayly's The Raj: India and the British 1600-1947 (1990), which presents a survey of the British presence in India during this lengthy period, and provides a framework with which to understand Bourne's career as a colonial photographer. The publication also includes a summary essay by John Falconer, "Photography in Nineteenth Century India",

Calcutta. C. A copy of the list of B&S prints bought by the V &A Museum in London in the late 1860's." [Information was acquired through email correspondence, April, 2009.] 25 The edited version of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue was compiled from the above listed sources and the negatives were placed in numerical order. 26 Unless otherwise stated, reference to the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue will relate to this edited and compiled version published in 2001.

12

which contains a discussion of Bourne's work. John Falconer continued this analysis in his 2001 catalogue, India: Pioneering Photographers, 1850-1900, which presents an overview of different photographic practices that developed in colonial India. Important studies on the documentation of Indian architecture were included in Maria Antonella Pelizzari' s 2003 edited collection of essays, Traces of India: Photography, Architecture,

and the Politics of Representation, 1850- 1900. All of these publications present a broad
and far-reaching overview of the complex subject of colonial photography in India. While drawing upon earlier research, this project, through documentation and research, specifically examines the albums' arrangement and their connection to Bourne's photographic practice, while further refining the dating of Bourne's negatives through outlining his travels in India. Dating revisions were made possible by the efforts of earlier researchers such as Sampson along with access to contemporary sources such as the BJP articles and the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue as found in Rayner's publication. Furthermore, the seven albums has provided a unique opportunity to study Bourne's work through his own selection, arrangement and presentation. Key aspects, such as the chronological and geographical organization of his prints, along with his inclusion of multiple and variant views of the same site are important aspects of how he viewed his work and what he felt was his achievement. The documentation and analysis of this collection sheds light on Bourne's perspective, providing a means to further our understanding of colonialist motivations and imperial systems of representation. As a colonial photographer, Bourne's work is important for the insight it provides on British prejudices, and his work functions as illustrative evidence of colonialist attitudes. This

13

thesis contributes to the field of colonialist photography through the documentation and analysis of this collection of personal albums.

SECTION IV. PROVENANCE OF THE SAMUEL BOURNE ALBUMS

Samuel Bourne's personal albums provide a case study of the varied histories and trajectories of a particular set of photographic objects. The seven albums are now split between two collections, the Royal Photographic Society Collection (RPS) at the National Media Museum, England and the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), Canada. This raises an important collections management problem, one that deals with the division of collections and the issue of re-establishing relationships. A central part of reconnecting these albums is establishing their provenance and tracing their histories. The nature of the set also relies on understanding their connection to Samuel Bourne and determining their trajectories over time from the private to the public spheres. It is also important to note that these seven albums form an inclusive collection, in which Bourne's entire career is represented; there are not any missing blocks of Bourne's negatives or any sections that could comprise material for a further, unknown album. 27 While nothing is known about the history of these albums before their transition into public collections, the most likely scenario is that the albums remained with the Bourne family, until a descendant, Major R.M. Bourne, Lanham Grange, Oakham, Rutland, donated four albums to the RPS in 1972. The first documentation of Samuel Bourne's connection with this set of albums is their arrival at the RPS in 1972. Further discussion of R.M. Bourne's relationship to the Bourne family can be found in Ann Turner's 1983 Creative Camera article "Samuel Bourne's English Photographs," in

/

It should be clarified that the albums do not include every single negative that Bourne produced and published, which is just over 2000 (according to the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue), but contain a subjective selection of705 negatives, which as a collection completely cover Bourne's career.

27

15

which she mentions that the late Major R.M. Bourne was in fact Bourne's grandson. 28 However, why the collection of seven albums was divided the way it was remains unclear. As mentioned, in 1972, the RPS acquired four albums from a descendent of Bourne, Major R.M. Bourne. While researching in England, I identified a Collection Advisory Committee record for the RPS, which verified the donation of "Five albums of views and portraits - mostly in India/ 1860-70 by Samuel Bourne, (1834-1912)/ Gift of Major R.M. Bourne,/ Langham Grange, Oakham, Rutland". Of the five albums donated, four were part of a coherent set based on their uniform bindings and form of presentation. 29 The Royal Photographic Society, one of the first photographic societies established soon after the birth of photography ( 1853), had developed important holdings for the history of photography in Great Britain,

~nd

its collection was a substantial

repository for key works by important British photographers such as Bourne. In 2002, The National Media Museum, a branch of the Science Museum, acquired the entire Royal Photographic Society Collection, including the set of four Samuel Bourne albums.
It is unclear why the full set of seven albums were not donated to the RPS, but

while researching the RPS records, I located a list of the remaining three albums, thus proving that the society was aware of the entire collection. On May 8 1992, Sotheby's London had the auction, "Photographic Images and Related Material", in which the other three Samuel Bourne albums were included (Lot 31 ). Ofkanwardip Gujral, a private

Bourne's connection to the Bourne family from correspondence with Gail Buckland, who worked at the RPS when the albums were donated, as well as Turner's direct correspondence with the Bourne family. 29 The binding and presentation of the fifth album are different from Bourne's personal set of albums. In addition it contains prints that also appear in Bourne's personal albums, and within the set there are no duplicate images.

On September 27, 2001, Gujral sold his collection of Indian photographs including the Bourne set at the Christie's auction, "Fine 19th Century Indian Photographs From The Collection Ofkanwardip Gujral" (Lot 53, 54, 55 - See Appendix B). According to Hugh Rayner, the Royal Photographic Society had hoped to acquire the complete collection, but was unable to secure adequate funding. 30 The RPS records in Bradford confirm their interest in the remaining set, as there is both the listing of the three albums, along with handwritten details of Gujral's contact information. However, it was the Archive of Modern Conflict that acquired the collection in 2001, excluding the presentation cup, and subsequently donated the albums to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2007? 1

SECTION V. CATALOGUING METHODOLOGY

Throughout the development of the thesis, cataloguing the entire set of albums was seen as an essential component of the project. The documentation of all seven albums was crucial to not only understanding the contents of the individual albums but also their relationship with one another, along with creating future access and dissemination of information about the collection. Two important elements, the targeted audience and the collection's content, helped shape the structure of the catalogue. It was clear that the intended audience would be both museum personnel and researchers, which necessitated designing the catalogue to include fields that would be relevant for these specific users. While key fields included repository accession number, title, creator, dates, medium, inscriptions and measurements, other fields, such as Bourne negative number, related more specifically to recording the context of the collection's relationship to Bourne's career.
32

Since an important part of the project is providing catalogue

information for the two institutions, essential fields used by the different institutions were included. Once the catalogue records are imported into an existing database, these fields will provide useful information on the albums and will ensure integration of the data into each institution's collections management system. Before constructing the database, I researched the required fields specific to such a catalogue, consulting resources such as the Getty's Categories for the Description of Works of Art along with the Mira Godard Center's Cataloguing Manual. These sources provided guidelines upon which to base decisions for defining cataloguing fields.

32

Detailed descriptions for each field in the Catalogue have been included in the introduction to Appendix

c.
18

Rayner's edited versiOn of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue, containing Bourne's negative numbers in numerical order, were used to situate the photographs within the wider context of Bourne's body of work. Furthermore, Bourne's BJP essays, the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue and Sampson's dissertation research were invaluable in creating an outline of Bourne's travels throughout India including the dates and negative numbers for all his locations (Appendix C). This outline formed a valuable resource throughout the cataloguing process as it was used to date the prints and provide a framework for understanding the internal arrangement of the albums.

19

SECTION VI. ANALYSIS OF THE SEVEN ALBUMS

The physical analysis and documentation of the seven albums reveals important aspects regarding their arrangement and contents, while defining their internal relationship as a coherent collection. The albums are connected to Bourne's professional career in India, with each album containing prints from a specific portion of Bourne ' s body of work. These albums are not in the style of personal scrapbooks, but were professionally and uniformly bound, titled, and presented. The bindings consist of green morocco leather with gilt details and printed titles (fig. 1 - 4). These elaborate bindings unite the collection, as they are specific to this set of albums. The bindings also indicate that these albums were created to proudly display a professional career. Each album is labeled in gilt on the front cover with a descriptive title that relates the album to Bourne ' s overall career. Along with the titles, each album contains the blind stamp of the publisher hired to fabricate the albums, "Marion & Co." (fig. 5), the publisher Bourne and Shepherd used for distribution of prints throughout Europe. This indicates that the albums were created not in India but in Europe, as Marion and Co. had offices in London as well as an outlet in Paris.
33

Each album contains albumen photographs of varying sizes mounted on both sides of the album pages and accompanied with handwritten ink captions (fig. 6). Although the albumen printing process can produce variable results, all of these prints contain consistent tonalities and an overall professional appearance, suggesting that the same printers printed them at one time. The prints also reveal specific forms of

33

20

deterioration, in which the outer edges contain loss of detail and overall fading. In consulting with Katharine Whitman, AGO Conservator, Photographs, it was determined that the deterioration was due to the contact of the outer edges of the albumen prints with the opposite page, constructed of acidic board. Both Bourne and Shepherd worked with wet-collodion, glass-plate negatives and the albumen process. Their inventory consisted of the different sized negatives they worked with; for instance, although he preferred larger plates, Bourne also catered to a demand for smaller prints, employing sizes 10.5 x 19 em (4 x 7 in.). 34 Bourne produced prints from glass-plate negatives in the studio's standard size of 25 x 30 em (10 x 12 in.) and later using 19 x 32 em (8 x 13 in.) for panoramic views. Shepherd's ethnographic portrait studies created under the Shepherd and Robertson firm employed 18 x 23 em negatives. 35 Colin Murray (1840 - 1884), who became the firm's main landscape photographer after Bourne's departure in 1870, continued using the same large format sized negatives that Bourne employed. 36 The prints in all seven albums correspond to the plate sizes utilized by all three photographers. Each print also contains the firm's credit name- Bourne or Bourne and Shepherd- and negative number, inscribed on the negative by scratching on the emulsion (fig. 7). The album pages contain handwritten captions inscribed below each print in ink that are related to the title of work as found in the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue.

Ibid., footnote 29, 346. Sizes according to Rayner's republished version of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue as well as Sampson's research in "The Success of Samuel Bourne," 346. 36 These are general dimensions; the prints are slightly smaller due to the wet-collodion printing process, in which the wet-collodion negative usually has streaky, blotchy edges, requiring the final print to be cropped in order to eliminate undesired black lines.
35

34

21

While cataloguing and researching the prints and their relationship to Bourne's work, two important sources were used, the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue, as published in Rayner's Photographic Journeys in the Himalayas, and Bourne's BJP essays. Through a comparison of Bourne's account of his travels throughout India and the Bourne and Shepherd catalogue, it became apparent that the two were closely related, that the sequence of the catalogue numbers corresponded to Bourne's travels throughout India. With further research, including consulting Sampson's chronology and the dating of Bourne's treks in the Himalayas, I was able to construct an outline that connected the research, providing dates and negative numbers for all of Bourne's travels throughout India (Appendix C). Each album assembles prints that relate to either a specific period or subject of Bourne's travels in India. Although the albums are not numbered in any way as to designate the order in which they are meant to be viewed, I have reconstructed the order of the albums according to how they relate to Bourne's career: his three excursions into the Himalayas, his travels between the treks in which he documented the architecture and landscapes of Northern India, his ongoing documentation of the hill stations, and his final trip to the Southern regions. Within each album, the photographs are grouped by site, and there are many inter-related views that reveal Bourne's innovative use of multiple perspectives to convey a sense of space. These aspects, the specific selection of prints and their organization, are crucial to understanding how Bourne viewed his work. In this section, the albums have been ordered according to how they fit within Bourne's career. The first three albums relate to Bourne's three treks into Northern India (The Sutlej -

Indian Groups etc., Views in Cashmere, and the Himalayas). In these albums the

22

photographs are presented in the chronological order in which they were made during each journey, however as previously mentioned the albums do not include every single negative that Bourne produced, but only a personalized selection of negative numbers. The other four albums, Indian Architecture and Scenery Vol. I, Indian Architecture and

Scenery Vol. 11, Hill Stations of India, and Photographs relate to Bourne's work either
between or after the treks, in which he focused on specific areas that he visited. The arrangement of the albums in this essay does not correspond to the presentation of the albums in the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue, which relates to the order in which they were catalogued and thus they are organized according to institution.

23

ALBUM 1: THE SUTLEJ- INDIAN GROUPS ETC.

The Sutlej - Indian Groups etc. is one of the three albums currently held at the
AGO. It contains thirty-four pages with a total of seventy-nine albumen prints (fig. 8), and includes Bourne negatives numbers 181-554 and 1100-1386, with some breaks and images lacking inscribed negative numbers. This album presents a selection of Bourne's earliest work, including a significant representation of prints from his first Himalayan trek into the Sutlej Valley in 1863, along with ethnographic studies by Charles Shepherd. The album begins with Bourne's first negative in the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue, negative number 181, "The Sutlej, Junction of the Buspa", which was taken at the outset of his Sutlej Valley trek (fig. 9). The album's organization then follows his journey into the Sutlej Valley, including a total of nineteen prints from this trek. Immediately following this section is twenty images of the first sites he visited, Kangra and Lahore, from his second journey into Kash1nir in 1864 (for details of his journey see Appendix C). Mid-way in the album's sequence, the narration of Bourne's travels abruptly ends, and the album's format and content changes. In this second half, the album pages contain smaller albumen prints (18 x 23 em) with two mounted on the page (fig.

10). The subject changes to ethnographic studies and the negative credits also change to
"Shepherd and Robertson Photo" (fig. 11 )37 While Shepherd's work has often been overlooked, it is known that he focused on portraiture, and provided many of the ethnographic studies. Judging on the credits, it is most likely he created these images

37 In this image of the inscription, it appears that the negative number has been scratched on at a different time and by a different hand than the signature credit. This suggests that this number was added after Shepherd joined the firm, which corresponds with the accounts of the addition of his inventory into the firm's stock at a later point in time.

24

during his earlier partnership with Robertson in 1862-63, and that these were added to their joint inventory when Bourne and Shepherd became partners. 38 The Sutlej -Indian Groups etc. album thus presents an important selection of the early work created by both Bourne and Shepherd, in their own respective specialties. Along with providing a selection of images of Bourne's first trek, the album includes rare images that highlight personal moments in Bourne's career in India. For example, in relationship to negative number 553, "Group Portrait with Samuel Bourne & the Raja of Chamba and his Retainers," (fig. 12) in which Bourne can be seen seated in the far left. 39 Bourne mentions this encounter with the Raja and other acquaintances in his BJP articles: "I found here [Chumba] three Europeans - the English Resident at the Raja's court, the Government Conservator of Forests, and a missionary, all Scotch men. They received me very kindly, and during my stay we all dined together two or three times a week, and spent some of those pleasant evenings which are characteristic of Englishmen (in which I of course include Scotch-men) when a few of them meet together, no matter in what comer of the globe it may be."
40

The next several pages discuss his outings with the group and the Raja, who was also an avid photographer. Having just departed on his first trek and traveling alone through an unknown landscape, the familiarity and comfort Bourne would have felt upon spending several weeks with fellow countrymen would have left a lasting impression of this

In "The Success of Samuel Bourne" (338), Sampson writes that Shepherd had already created many ethnographic views prior to his partnership with Bourne and these were subsequently added to their joint inventory when they became partners. 39 This title was assigned by the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue [2001 edited version]. 40 Samuel Bourne, "Narrative of a Photographic Journey to Kashmir (Cashmere) and Adjacent Districts," British Journal ofPhotography (Nov. 2 1866): 524.

moment. The inclusion of this print in this album reflects its personal connection to Bourne and his experiences during this trek. The last three prints in the album are also rare as well as unsigned and unnumbered, and hence they do not seem to be part of the commercial stock of the firm. Since these prints are group portraits, it is quite possible that they were taken by both Bourne and Shepherd operating as a team. The first of these prints is identified as "Group of Sir James [John] Lawrence and Members of Council." (fig. 13) Upon further research on the National Portrait Gallery's website, another print of this image was located. This print is a group portrait of the Supreme India Council in Simla 1864, and reveals Bourne's emerging status and connection to the British political life in India. The final two images relate to Bourne's involvement with the British social life in colonial India, "Picnic at Ootacamund 1869" And "Wedding Group at Hon. A. Ross', Simla 1870." (fig. 14, 15) Unlike the group portrait of the Supreme Indian Council, photographs such as the picnic outing have more of a personal meaning behind their inclusion. 41

41

It is most likely that it was only Bourne who took the photograph of "Picnic at Ootacamund 1869" since he traveled to Ootacamund in 1869 to complete a series of views at the Hill Station .

ALBUM 2- VIEWS IN CASHMERE Containing forty-one pages with eighty-two albumen prints, and covenng negative numbers 775 to 1001, the RPS album, Views in Cashmere, provides a substantial record of Bourne's second journey throughout the district of Kashmir (fig. 16). 42 Bourne's second trek to Kashmir began with his departure from Lahore in March 17, 1864 and ended with his arrival in Lucknow, Dec. 24, 1864 (Appendix C). During his travels, he covers the Kashmir Valley, focusing extensively on such picturesque locations as Srinagar and the Scinde Valley. Bourne's trip to Kashmir was a significant part of his artistic development and colonial vision in India, as Sampson argues: "Photography in this part of Kashmir was thrilling for Bourne because scene after scene for him could be framed in picturesque certainty."43 Important examples of his work during this trek include the Jhelum waterway series at Srinagar (negatives 784 - 794). Negative 786, "View down the Jhelum, from the Island" and negative 792, "View up the Jhelum, from below the Island" (fig. 17, 18) portray Bourne's consistent picturesque framing, in which he employs the trees along the waterway systems in the Kashmir Valley to create idyllic compositions. Furthermore these images, through their positions at different points on the waterways, relate to Bourne's methodology throughout his journeys, in which he creates inter-related views that allow one to derive a sense of the place. Another example of related views in the Kashmir Valley is the Dhul Canal series, which comprises eleven prints (neg. 796 - 798, 824, 827 - 834) in the album and more than twenty dispersed throughout the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue.
Many location names in India have changed over time; in this case the previous spelling of Kashmir (Cashmere) was used in the album's title . The current form of location names will be used in the text except when referring to titles of both albums and prints. 43 Gary Sampson, "Unmasking the Colonial Picturesque," in Colonialist Photography : lmag(in)ing Race and Place, edited by Eleanor M.

ALBUM 3 -THE HIMALAYAS Part of the AGO's collection, the album Himalayas contains an extensive number of prints from Bourne's most well-known and documented trek (fig. 19). Containing sixty pages, one hundred and nineteen albumen prints, and covering negative numbers 1426 to 1655, the album progresses chronologically through Bourne's third trip in the Higher Himalayas in 1866, beginning with Narkunda and ending with Nynee Tal. This trek produced a substantial amount of material for the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue and is the most discussed period of Bourne's career. The album begins with the very first negative published from this trek, negative 1426, "Narkunda, Village and Dak Bungalow." The album includes his well-known high altitude mountain photographs such as his famous Manirung Pass series, negatives 1467 14 72, and other images that portrayed the "exotic" aspects of the Indian landscape, including negative 1436, "Mussocks for Crossing the Beas below Bajoura" (fig. 20, 21). Many photographs reflect Bourne's interest in documenting geological formations and botany, for example negative 1509, "Specimen of Edible Pine" or 1458, "View of Curious Gravel Formations on the Lagudarsi stream at Kioto, Spiti" (fig. 22, 23). These prints are significant in understanding Bourne's career; his interest was not only in composing a picturesque scene but also in describing geological detail. These images also reflect Bourne's motivations in his Himalayas excursions, in which he sets out to prove his technical mastery of the medium and the Indian landscape. Well-known images such as negative 1440, "Small Waterfall above Prini, Kulu", reveal the extent to which Bourne sought out the picturesque in the Indian landscape (fig. 24). Elements such as water, rocks, rustic foliage, and the inclusion of one or two people were ideal for forming the

28

picturesque scene.

44

These prints therefore reveal the complexity behind Bourne's

motivations and pictorial experience.

The term 'rustic foliage' has been used to describe the inclusion of plants and foliage in a picturesque composition, portraying a controlled wilderness in the style of the English countryside.

ALBUM 4- INDIAN ARCHITECTURE AND SCENERY VOL. 1 The AGO album, Indian Architecture and Scenery Vol. 1 (fig. 25) is the first of two related albums devoted to presenting the work that Bourne completed between his main treks, in which he documented sites of colonial culture and architectural heritage, including temples, mosques, palaces along with specific locations that would appeal to a British clientele, such as colonial buildings, government parks and memorial sites. Containing fifty-two pages with one hundred and three albumen prints, Indian

Architecture and Scenery Vol. 1 spans negative numbers, 1012 to 1749. 45 Vol. 1 is
arranged slightly differently than the three previous albums that represent Bourne's three main treks, in that it is not organized by numerical order but mainly assembled by location, and within each place, the work is presented as a group of inter-related views. The locations focus on his travels throughout India's Northern region between the second and third trek in 1865. Beginning in Calcutta, the seat of colonial authority, the album includes significant sites such as Benares, Agra, Lucknow and Cawnpore. The album also includes two views taken by the firm of Shepherd and Robertson and added subsequently to the Bourne and Shepherd inventory, negative 337, [untitled] and negative 357, "Sir Henry Havelock's Grave in the Alum Bagh". According to Sampson's chronology, the negatives between 316 and 411, which include views of Lucknow, Delhi and Agra, were created by the firm of Shepherd and Robertson and added later to the Bourne and Shepherd inventory. 46 The inscriptions on these prints correspond to this information; the first print contains the Shepherd and Robertson inscription, while the second is inscribed with only the negative number.

Starting with the first print, negative number 1698, "Lord Hardinge's Statue and the Ochterlony Monument" the album includes many interrelated series of government parks, memorial scenes, and monuments to recent British imperial history. Along with significant series depicting places of the colonial government, this album includes prints from Cawnpore, a significant location with strong associations to the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The first image included from the Cawnpore series, negative 1208, "Suttee Chowra Ghat, the scene of the Massacre" (fig. 26), reflects the Anglo-Indian desire for images that related to scenes of the recent conflict. Sampson discusses the profound interest the British had for these sites, "As Bourne's own remarks indicate, the events and specifically related sites of the Mutiny loomed large in the psyche of the British public even well after the conflict had ended."47 Other prints from this location include an interrelated series of the Memorial Well at Cawnpore, negatives 1203 - 1207, a memorial dedicated to British civilians who were killed at Cawnpore during the mutiny (fig. 27, 28). The importance to Anglo-Indians of the Memorial Well and other sites related to the Mutiny can be seen in the fact that these locations at one point became more popular than the Taj Mahal. 48 These images highlight Bourne's awareness of this social desire for scenes of colonial administration and history, and his ability to capitalize on British preoccupation with colonial India. Along with the desire for images of the colonial government, Bourne catered to the British desire for an exotic representation of Indian people and landscapes. Included in the album are colonial narratives of Indian village life, such as the Calcutta series "Rustic Scene and Village Life in Bengal". According to the Bourne and Shepherd

31

Catalogue, the full extent of this series includes a total of nine negatives, 1730 to 1739. The album includes four related views from this series, negatives 1732, 1735, 1738, 1739, (fig. 29 - 32) which impose picturesque standards and aesthetics upon Indian subject matter while omitting any interest in documenting the social realities of the village.
49

Immediately following this sequence of village life is the Barrackpore Park

series, providing a strong contrast between an Indian and highly structured British landscape (fig. 33 - 36). According to the Catalogue, this series includes six inter-related views of the government park in Calcutta, negatives 1744 - 1749, while the album includes four from the series, negatives 1744, 1747, 1748, and 1749. This is representative of a larger theme within Bourne's work as he attempts to reconcile the discordant elements of a colonial landscape. Furthermore, the example of Barrackpore Park illustrates Bourne's methodology in using multiple vantage points throughout a related group of images to provide a means to move through the government park. Sampson discusses these images, "Like numerous others of Bourne's photographs of India, the Barrackpore group was conceived as a closely interrelated series. This is especially evident by the way the photographer has carefully considered various vantage points and prospects that one would encounter upon approaching the house and wandering about the grounds." 50 The format of the album conveys the use of inter-related views to establish different points of entering the grounds and moving through the park, thus highlighting Bourne's photographic concept and understanding of these series.

ALBUM 5- INDIAN ARCHITECTURE AND SCENERY VOL. 2 "Indian Architecture and Scenery Vol. 2", located at the RPS, continues to follow Bourne's journeys throughout both Northern and Southern India that began in the previous album(fig. 37). Containing forty-eight pages with ninety-five albumen prints, the album includes Bourne negative numbers 1345 to 2066, with breaks in numbering and several images without inscribed negative numbers. The album contains the same arrangement as Vol. 1, with the prints assembled according to location.
51

While the

album begins with Delhi and several sites throughout Northern India, made between Bourne's second and third treks, the second half of the album focuses on Bourne's later excursion in Southern India, including Tanjore, Trichinopoly, and Jubbulpore. The prints included highlight Bourne's preoccupation with photographing historically significant Indian architecture, including temples, pagodas, and monuments. Although the commercial demand for views of an 'exotic' India had a significant influence on Bourne's work, consideration must be given to his motivation to also provide photographs of documentary and historical value. In discussing Bourne's extensive inventory of historical sites, Sampson points out that these images along with his writings "reveal that Bourne had made a significant effort to acquaint himself with the current state of archaeology in India to endow his images with a topical interest beyond their assuredly exotic appeal for western patrons. "
52

Bourne was not alone in his

commitment to documenting Indian architecture. Many commercial and official photographers such as Linnaeus Tripe and Thomas Biggs were involved in the recording of archeology, temples and shrines, which was further encouraged by the semi-official

patronage of the British government. This agenda was part of a larger imperial system that the British exerted throughout their colonies through the use of photography to both represent and organize colonial landscapes and culture. As a colonial photographer, Bourne was heavily influenced by this ideology and his photographic representation of the landscapes and inhabitants thus formed part of a wider project of what Ryan has termed "visual surveillance". 53 Vol. 2 reflects Bourne's interest in architectural documentation, shown through his inclusion of multiple views of historical sites such as Mandapum, including negatives 2064, "Mandapum, with Facade of carved Stonehorses" and 2066 "Mandapum, showing three of the Carved Horse Pillars" (fig. 38). 54 Also included in this section are eleven unnumbered and uncaptioned images that depict different archeological sites of caves (fig. 39). Although these eleven prints lack captions or Bourne negative numbers, further research has confirmed that they are in fact the Ellora and Ajanta Caves, which Bourne had visited. 55 The final set of four images are not even located in India; they are in fact images of locations in Egypt, near the Suez Canal, with captions stating "Alexandria", "Pompey's Pillar", "Cleopatra's Needle", and the "Suez Canal" (fig. 40- 43). These four prints are of varying smaller sizes, do not correspond to Bourne's negative sizes, and several have an oval format. An explanation for the inclusion of these prints could be in

Ryan, Picturing Empire, 54. Sampson, in "The Success of Samuel Bourne in India", (p. 342), also highlights his documentation of the sculptures at Mandapum in his discussion of Bourne's use of multiple views for historical documentation . 55 The Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue includes negatives taken at both the Ajunta Caves, negatives 1928 to 1936, as well as the Ellora Caves: negatives 1937 to 1950. It is not clear why these prints would not have any negative numbers or captions; the negative numbers could have been cut off or perhaps added at a later time for this series, although this does not correlate with Bourne's methodology. Their format and subject matter however, along with the fact that Bourne visited these very sites and they are included in the inventory, provide reason to believe that they are prints by Bourne.
54

53

34

the fact that this album ends with Bourne's final chapter in India and part of his voyage home would include the route between India and Europe, the Suez Canal. As the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, it would have been a new travel route and experience for Bourne, as well as a topical subject worthy of remembering. It is not difficult to imagine Bourne continuing to document his experiences even after his affiliation with the Bourne and Shepherd studio ended. These could be images Bourne either photographed or purchased during his journey back to England.

35

ALBUM 6- HILL STATIONS OF INDIA The RPS album "Hill Stations of India" focuses on work Bourne completed during his travels to hill stations around India (fig. 44). Along with documenting important colonial government sites, Bourne spent a significant amount of time photographing the hill stations he frequented, specifically his base of operations, Simla. Hill Stations were the temporary retreat for the Anglo-European community during India's infamous hot, rainy season, in which British residents migrated to the milder climate of the Himalayan foothills, also referred to as the "hills". 56 Destinations such as Simla and Ooctacamund thus became important locations for colonial society. "Hill Stations of India" is one of the more extensive albums, consisting of fiftyeight pages with one hundred and fifteen albumen prints, and covering negative numbers, 1787 to 2037. 57 The album is similar to the two Indian Architecture and Scenery albums in that it has sections organized by locations and relates to specific periods in Bourne's career. Beginning with his extensive photographs of Simla, the album includes two important sub-series he produced, "Simla in the Summer" and "Simla in the Winter". These are followed by a series on other hill stations, including Murree, Darjeeling, Ootacamund, and the Neilgherries, which Bourne made in 1869 after his third trek and before leaving India. Simla was significant to both colonial affairs and Bourne's career; it was the base of operations for Bourne and his home away from England. The album represents Bourne's intimate familiarity with the landscape through the inclusion of many interrelated views within the series. As Sampson discusses, Bourne published almost
Sampson, "The Success of Samuel Bourne in India," 338. Several sections of the album include early negative numbers that are out of sequence, but which relate to the geographic location.
57 56

36

ninety images of practically every significant landmark and building in the hill station, including views taken of and from the Bourne and Shepherd Studio, also known as Talbot House. 58 The first print in the album, negative 1787 "Talbot House,' the Church etc.", (fig. 45) shows a picturesque view of their studio with the church in the distance. Many views in the album are taken from this location, including two variant winter images, negatives 1758a and 1758, "View from Talbot house, looking North" (fig. 46, 47) which show the same view at different times of the day. This is the only instance of Bourne including two such variant images in the albums. Other prints including negative 1756, "View on the Mall near the Barnes Court Road", negative 1757, "The Mall and Jakko near Oakover" and negative 1760, "On the Mall North of Jakko" (fig. 48 - 50) portray different views along the Mall, Simla's main avenue of social exchange. 59 The extensive nature of this section and the inclusion of variant views of important locations reflect the strength of the market for images of Simla. The later part of the album continues the in-depth presentation of the hill stations, while also showing Bourne's partiality to picturesque compositions, in which, for example, there is an entire sequence devoted to waterfalls around the Neilgherries (in the order of the album: negatives 2008, 2011, 2009, 2012, 2037, 2034, 2030, 2028, 2018, 2016, 2014, 20 19). Included near the end of the album are several ethnographic studies of the native population taken at Darjeeling, negative 1907, "Darjeeling - Lepcha man, native of Sikkim" (fig. 51). However, Bourne ends the album on his own note, with a truly picturesque image, negative number 2019, "Double Waterfall near Croormund" (fig. 52).

ALBUM 7- PHOTOGRAPHS Most studies tend to focus on Bourne's photography alone with little mention about the affairs and work produced by the Bourne and Shepherd studio. While Bourne traveled throughout India to provide landscape and architectural views, his partner Charles Shepherd conducted the portrait business of the studio. The RPS album,

Photographs, (fig. 53) provides a counterpoint to the other albums as it includes many
large-format portraits of both British and Indian subjects, along with portraits of the photographers. Also included in Photographs are works taken by Colin Murray immediately after Bourne's departure, along with a series of photographs that follow the Prince of Wales in his travels around India in 1876. These rare photographs provide further insight into the commercial operations of the Bourne and Shepherd studio, including its strong affiliation with Anglo-Indian affairs, along with Bourne's continuing interest in the commercial partnership after his return to England. Containing one hundred and eleven albumen prints mounted on forty-seven pages, only forty-four prints in the album, Photographs, have inscribed negative numbers, spanning negatives 2083 - 2386. The album begins with a series of largeformat portraits (35 x 26 em), of both British and Indian dignitaries along with portraits of the studio's photographers, Bourne, Shepherd and Murray (fig. 57 - 59). The album includes influential colonial officers, such as the "Lord Mayo, Governor General of India" (the first print) and "Sir John Lawrence, late Viceroy of India", who was also included in the group portrait of colonial officers in the Sutlej album (figs. 13, 54, 55). The album also has a series of female portraits, four of which were taken at the same outdoor setting without any numbers or captions (see fig. 56). These portraits were taken

38

at the same location as the portrait of Bourne, which is unattributed but was probably taken by Shepherd. There is also a portrait series of Indian dignitaries, all taken in the same studio with many of the same props as is seen, for instance, in the prints "The Rajah of Bownuggur", and "The Rajah of Rayicote one of the Kattymar Chiefs" (fig. 60, 61). Following the selections of highlights from the studio's operations, this album contains nine, small format prints (11 x 16 em) that appear to be images of British and Scottish landscapes, and are thought to be examples of Bourne's pre-Indian photography of the 1850s. Their inclusion fills out Bourne's life and photography. 60 This section is followed by two group portraits of the Prince of Wales and his colonial administration; "H.R.H and Suite" and "H.R.H. The Prince, the Viceroy, and the guests at Government House, Calcutta" both taken in 1876 (fig. 62, 63). These prints reflect the studio's influential status and connection to the colonial administration. These portraits are immediately followed by a variety of both small and large format photographs of the Prince of Wales' India trip in 1876. The 1881 Bourne and Shepherd catalogue offered the "Royal Photographic Tour Album", which "Illustrat[ ed] the progress of H.R.H the Prince of Wales through India; containing 140 Photographs of Persons and Places visited by His Royal Highness during his tour, and with Descriptive Letterpress." 61 Unfortunately the catalogue does not provide any additional information

Not much is known about Bourne's early work, however Sampson points out that he first picked up a camera after I85I, and it wasn't until after I858 that he began photographing landscapes of "real wilderness", with his first excursion into the English Lake District. Sampson also notes that during his trip to the Lake District, Bourne created thirty-seven 8 x I 0 inch glass plate negatives, which do not correspond with the size of these prints. Further research connects some of these titles, including "On the Lay above Dunkald" and "Bridge of Tilt & Glen Lilt", to locations in Scotland, where it was also documented that Bourne visited. It seems probable that these prints were taken by Bourne, since it is known that he visited these regions, and they also include rural subject matter and rustic imagery, which as Sampson writes 1 preoccupied Bourne in his early work.

of the negative numbers associated with this series or the sizes of the prints. Within the album, the first images included from this series are large-format prints (22 x 29 em) that portray the exterior and interior saloon of the Royal Naval Ship, the HMS Serapis, on which the Prince of Wales traveled from England to India. The following prints from this series then become smaller, about 9.5 x 14 em, and the page layout changes to include four prints per page. An example of this smaller size and layout can be seen in the page that includes the print, "The first Tiger killed by the Prince at Jeppore in India" (fig. 64, 65). This print reveals the intimate access the photographers had throughout the trip.

Photographs concludes with work produced by the studio immediately after
Bourne's departure, in which photographer Colin Murray was hired to continue Bourne's landscape and urban views (fig. 66). All of these later images, after number 2112, also have the studio credit "Bourne and Shepherd". 62 After Bourne's departure, the firm kept his name on both the company title and the inventory of views, since Bourne's views were widely sought and had market value, and the firm's name was at that point widely recognized.

Negative 2112 is the last negative from Bourne's Trichinopoly trip, with the next negative taken in Colombo, which, according to research consulted, Bourne never visited. I have therefore designated negatives taken after this number as ones taken by Colin Murray. The negative inscription also changed from "Bourne" to "Bourne and Shepherd".

SECTION VII- CONCLUSION

The analysis and documentation of these albums as a coherent collection has been the focus of this thesis project. In the process, the relationship between the two collections at the AGO and the RPS has been established. Research completed has included: the cataloguing of all seven albums; the tracing of Bourne's travels throughout India, including the dating and location of his negatives; and subsequent analysis of the intellectual attributes and arrangement of the collection. The project has resulted in significant dating clarifications based on the chronological relationship between Bourne's travels and the subsequent numbering of his negatives. Most importantly, through cataloguing and research, the project has revealed Bourne's understanding of his work, as seen through the geographic and chronologie arrangement of the photographs in the albums. While the albums' physical properties have been documented in the appended catalogue, contextual analysis has provided a framework with which to consider the set of albums in relation to colonialist photography. An important aspect of the project was providing the completed documentation and research for each institution's respective portion of the seven albums, in the form of a catalogue, to both the AGO and National Media Museum. The catalogue was created in a format that could be modified and imported into both the AGO and the National Media Museum's collections management systems.
63

Furthermore, the National Media Museum

has requested a bound version of the catalogue for its library, which will be provided by the end of the 2009 summer semester.
As of June 28, 2009, the catalogue in the form of an excel sheet was provided to Brian Liddy, Manager Collections Access, at the National Media Museum. The AGO is currently completing a transition to a TMS database, the catalogue will be imported when the database is operational.
63

41

Based on the project's research and documentation, all seven albums form a complete collection that retrospectively present Bourne's career in India in its entirety. Through its organization and structure, the collection not only provides insight into Bourne's own perspective of his work but also sheds light on colonialist attitudes and photographic practices in the British Empire. Implicit in Bourne's work is an imperial way of seeing that shaped his aesthetic and photographic practice. As Ryan recently wrote, Bourne's work as well as other colonial photographers "may be seen as part of a discourse on imperial geographic exploration. "
64

Analysis of colonial photography thus

continues to reveal new understandings of a complex period in Anglo-Indian affairs. This collection provides a rich resource for furthering our knowledge and scholarly analysis of Bourne's position as a British photographer in nineteenth- century India.

APPENDIX C- SAMUEL BOURNE'S INDIA TREK ROUTES AND CORRESPONDING NEGATIVE NUMBERS

This appendix provides an outline of Bourne's travels during his career in India, including dates, locations and negative numbers for his three excursions. This document correlates negative numbers to specific periods of Bourne's career in order to clarify the dating of his work. In compiling this document, I have drawn upon the information found in Samuel Bourne's three British Journal ofPhotography articles (1864, 1867, and 1870), the Bourne and Shepherd catalogue (from the published version in Hugh Rayner's Photographic Journeys in the Himalayas, 2001), and Gary Sampson's compilation of Bourne's travels and his chronology in his 1991 PhD. dissertation. Through matching Bourne negative numbers, as found in the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue, with the dates mentioned in Bourne's series of travel articles throughout the Himalayas, one can follow his travels throughout India and accurately date all of the negatives made during his treks. 1 Negatives completed during and after Bourne's three treks can be dated through analyzing the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue, in which negatives are numbered chronologically, 2 as well as drawing upon the detailed chronology in Sampson's dissertation. After determining locations Bourne visited between and after the treks (through the Catalogue and Sampson's research), the dates for each site can be easily determined, as there is only a year between the trips.

Arrival in India: Bourne lands in Calcutta in January 1863, and in February travels to Simla (a station in the Himalayas at an elevation of 8000 ft) to set up his photography 3 establishment and base of operations in March 1863.
Dates Arrives in Simla from Calcutta: Feb./March 1863 Negative Numbers 001 - 156 Location Simla (Base of Operations/Studio)

Trek 1: Simla- Sutlej Valley Dates: July 29 - Oct. 12, 1863 Total duration: 10 weeks Bourne Negative Numbers: 181 - 315

Negative numbers are based on the edited edition of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue in Hugh Rayner's Photographic Journey 's in The Himalayas, in which not all the entries are accounted for and often negative numbers overlap in certain areas. 2 The only exception to the chronological numbering of the Bourne negatives are the negatives produced by Shepherd and Robertson of 1862- 63 , which were added to the inventory later and inserted at different points in the Catalogue. 3 Samuel Bourne, "Photography in the East," British Journal ofPhotography (July I 1863): 269.

Between Treks: Dates: November, 1863 -March, 1864 Negative Numbers: 316 - 411
[Besides several views of Umritsur (negatives 407- 41 0) it does not appear that Bourne produced any negatives between the first and second trek. The negatives between these treks, 316 - 407, include views of Lucknow, Delhi and Agra, which according to Sampson's chronology were created by the firm of Shepherd and Robertson and added later to the Bourne and Shepherd inventory.]

Trek 2: Kashmir
Departs Lahore, March 17, 1864, arrives in Srinigar, July 3, leaves Kashmir in November, and arrives in Lucknow, December 24, 1864.

APPENDIX D- SAMUEL BOURNE ALBUMS PRINT CATALOGUE

Note to Reader: In the accompanied catalogue, the information following columns, reading from left to right:

IS

presented m the

1. Album Heading and Album Catalogue ID: These two fields relate to the internal structure of the database. The Album heading refers to the album in which the prints are found. The Album Catalogue ID relates to the internal structure of the database, in which the albums as whole objects are catalogued under a separate layout, with each album given an ID number. 2. Catalogue ID: This number was developed for the specific purposes of the catalogue. It is a consecutive number, assigned by myself, that follows the exact order of the photographs as they appear in each album. The albums were catalogued in the following order: 1) The Sutlej - Indian Groups & Etc., 2)

Himalayas; 3) Indian Architecture and Scenery Vol. I; 4) Indian Architecture and Scenery Vol. 11; 5) Hill Stations of India; 6) Photographs; 7) Views of Cashmere.
In some cases the institution's accession number (see below) was out of sequence and the Print Catalogue ID kept a record of the exact sequence of prints within each album. 3. Repository ID: This field records the institution's accession number for each print.

93

4. Bourne Negative Number: The Bourne and Shepherd studio was systematic in the numbering of their negatives, and each print contains a studio number. 1 This number connects the prints to the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue. 5. Title Caption: This field records the handwritten captions included on each album page. These are generally descriptive titles that for the most part correspond with the titles in the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue (see below). 6. Title Catalogue: This related field records the titles provided in the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue (the 2001 edited version). While both sets of titles for the most part corresponded, there are many minor discrepancies between the two. The Catalogue titles organizes the information differently, with the location of the image preceding the descriptive title. Also, the edited version of the Bourne and Shepherd Catalogue that was used in the project only contained negative numbers up to 2200, ending with Bourne's departure from the firm. Thus, the records of the prints by Colin Murray in the catalogue only have title captions. 7. Creator: This identifies the maker of the negative. This information was derived from the inscription scratched on the negative. While most negatives were taken by Bourne, there were a significant number of ethnographic studies and studio portraits by his partner Charles Shepherd (including earlier work he completed under the Shepherd and Robertson firm), along with later negatives by Colin Murray. There are also several prints that lack either or both a caption and a negative number, and these are not attributed to a photographer. In some cases there is enough information to proceed with identifying the photographer, for
1 The inscription changed throughout the history of the firm; during the period Bourne was a partner (1863 - 70), the inscription contained "Bourne" before the number. After Bourne left, and Murray became a partner, the inscription became "Bourne and Shepherd".

instance if it is part of a series of prints taken at a specific time and location. These have been identified as attributed. For prints in which there is not enough information to assign the photographer, the entry states Unknown Photographer. There are also many large format portraits in the album Photographs, which have been attributed to Charles Shepherd since he is known to have operated the portrait aspect of the studio operations. 8. Negative Date: This records the date of the negative. Dates were ascertained by the negative number, which related to the period in which Bourne was traveling in India. In order to date specific prints according to their negative numbers (along with understanding the order of the albums) an outline of Bourne's travels throughout India was created: See appendix B. 9. Inscriptions Mount: This fields records the inscriptions on the album page.
