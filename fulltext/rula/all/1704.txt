Abstract
Decision-making framework for small business with limited available capital Master of Applied Science 2012 Milad Arouni

Program of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering In the world of business special attention is paid to entrepreneurs for their potential and large corporations for their impact on the market. Due to this, small businesses often fall short of resources and tools to help them grow. The aim of this dissertation is to introduce a framework for decision making to small businesses as a tool to help embed more structure into their organization. functionality and usefulness. The framework consists of several steps: quantitative and mathematical feasibility study of the decision The framework was then applied to two distinct case studies to display its 1) corporate plan and financial assessment 2) a current state analysis 3) a The framework in each case study resulted in an objective and qualified decision. It also suggests that, due to the unique structure and characteristics of each small business, the framework proposed would only be relevant and applicable on a general level and more work is required to refine the details in order to be able apply it universally to business entities with limited working capital. iii Ryerson University

Qualitative decision-making research suggests that one's personality and attitude can directly affect the decision-making process,

whereas quantitative decision-making research suggests that numbers and statistics are the determining factors in the decision-making process (Hui-Chao, 2004). Simon categorizes decisions into two steps, programmed and non-programmed

For example, Buzerman specified six specific steps

(Cooper, 1981). A way to embed structure into decision-making is to come up with a framework for it, but first one must identify and define the decision maker.

Cooper et al. have suggested a structured approach to decision-making

who came up with the term of "economic man."

The business `decision-maker' was really defined by Jon Stuart Mill in 1874, In an article Persky (1995)

references Mill and his work where he argues that "[Political economy] does not treat the whole of man's nature as modified by the social state, nor of the whole conduct of man in society. It is concerned with him solely as a being who desires to obtaining that end" (Persky, 1995, p.4). possess wealth, and who is capable of judging the comparative efficacy of means for Later, Mill argued that "an arbitrary definition of man, as a being who inevitably does that by which he may obtain the greatest amounts of necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical selfdenial with which they can be obtained" (Mill, 1874). model of a person with the following traits:

This work later gave way to the term "economic man" which is defined as a 1) He is completely informed and knows all the course of action that is open to him and realizes the outcomes of those decisions (Finetti, 1937; Georgescu-Roegen, 1950; Edwards, 1954). 12

uncertainty faced by entrepreneurs (Hambrick & Crozier, 1985; Covin & Slevin, that because managers have more resources available to them, they are able to make more rational decisions (Busenitz & Barney, 1997). Furthermore, managers tend to have more time for making their decisions and therefore can examine more options. Finally, there are elaborate decision-making policies and schemes available to large business managers (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Nelson & Winter, 1982). It is 1989), when compared to managers of larger firms (Mintzberg, 1973). It is argued

There have been several attempts at defining a small business (Scott & Bruce, 1987; Cooper, 1981; Carland et al., 1984; Bates, 1990; firm that is managed by its owner or part owners and has a small market share (Culkin & Smith, 2000). 14 Culkin & Smith, 2000; Begley & Boyd, 1987).

indicated is the minimally applicable or not applicable myth that a small business is simply a scaled down version of a large one. While this can be argued in terms of size and structure of the business, it is not completely true due to the key

differences that exist in terms of the decision-making process and logistics. Larger businesses are inherently more complex in their structure, organization, function or act like large ones do (Culkin & Smith, 2000). departmentalization, and specialization, as such; small businesses just do not Another key difference between small and large firms is the availability of

1.4 What makes small businesses so important?
Ironically, it is small businesses that play a more prominent role in existing

economic models such as Canada's. There are more than one million registered

small businesses in Canada in 2011 (Industry Canada, 2011). This number accounts 17

for over 98% of the total number of businesses and is responsible for over 48% of the total labour force across this country (Industry Canada, 2011). However, the survival rate of such companies is very low, for such reasons as

limited capital and cash flow availability. According to Statistics Canada, over 58%

of these businesses fail before their 5th year anniversary (Industry Canada, 2011).

Therefore, it is crucial to put in a place a vehicle to help these businesses survive,

Culkin and Smith (2000) in their paper wrote, "With any problem, the search for a how was it handled. If one can find a satisfactory solution in this manner, job done.

However, in small

businesses, there is usually no place for a specialist and hence likely no past

precedent" (Culkin & Smith, 2000). With the introduction of the world wide web and the slew of information that is currently available, small businesses now have access to past performances and decisions of other firms to help guide them in the decision making process. However, the challenge lies with knowing where to look and how to

find reliable sources of information. So, the search for a solution may be random, trial and error or perhaps based upon the experience of another firm that had a similar type of problem. Moreover, the information acquired may not be accurate in

the sense of completeness. Dicken (1971) argued that an organization would filter

techniques such as Linear Programming Technique for Multidimensional Analysis of Preference (LINMAP) (Wang & Li, 2012; Srinivasan & Shocker, 1973). This technique is based on weighted outputs for decision-making and comparisons of alternatives. Much like the LINMAP the classical model of multiple criteria decisionmaking model is also based on prioritization and evaluation of existing alternatives (Wang & Li, 2012). These models and techniques are highly mathematical and require an understanding of programming theory and statistical analysis - a skill not common to a small business owner. Campanella et al. (2011) in their framework

1.7 Existing Gap for Small Business Framework
The existing literature in decision-making and small business cover a range

of topics that are worthy of review and further study. Decision-making literature

has the tendency to approach the subject from either a purely mathematical (Bates,

1990) or psychological point of view (Gilligan et al., 1983). Small business literature on the other hand is most focused on the behavioural and characteristic of the owner(s) (Culkin & Smith, 2000), which is consistent in explaining why the

literature often groups small businesses and large organizations together. Existing papers make the argument that a small business is not "a small large business" due to the influence of the owner on its operation. However, what gets lost in that translation is that small business is also not "a large entrepreneurial firm." In a small business , there must exist elements of organization, structure and rational decisionmaking. As such, falling in between the two business classes requires a hybrid model entrepreneurs and large businesses. of decision-making and a new set of tools that differ from ones available to The objective in this thesis study is to create a decision-making framework

These steps are 1) Forecasting competitors, 2) Forecasting Demand, 3) Estimating average examine demand estimate 8) Re-examine profit goal, and 9) Deciding (Cyert et al., unit cost, 4) Specify objectives 5) Evaluate, 6) Re-examine cost estimate, 7) Re1959).

(Bazerman, 2001)Earlier Hammond et al. in 1999 characterized elements of smart choices in seven steps (Lee & Wiashinghe, 2010). The steps mentioned in all the eight steps. Moreover, in an article by Lee and Wirasinghe in 2010 this process is in aforementioned decision making processes are general logical steps, which provide 25

little guidance to the decision-maker and would be of little use to a small business

owner whom often has limited management skills and is pressed for time. Therefore, in order to create a decision-making procedure or framework for a small business owner, one must include a few of features. Firstly, a decision-making

framework must be simple to understand. Often, as the case above the steps in decision-making framework is general, which leaves the decision-maker to interpret the process as he or she sees fit. Secondly, a decision-making framework must decision-maker is able to understand and follow the process more accurately. specify tools and resources for each step.

workstation to the overall utilization of workers and queue lines for assembly and testing could be pursued. Table 4 below represents various scenarios and

alternatives of the production department at ESI; the effects of an additional workstation to the overall utilization of workers and queue lines for assembly and testing. These results are in anticipation of the OEM line producing 100 boards per quarter. Currently the company only manufactures about 10 boards per quarter in addition to 5 engineering contracts. This yields to a queue length of 10 with worker utilization of 49%.

budget. Moreover, the 25% reduction still leaves a queue of about 63 items, which will still affect the reputation of the company and customer satisfaction. This leaves the option of outsourcing as the only viable solution. Table 5

showed that with the option of outsourcing, the queue length is reduced to zero

division of ESI and will ensure better customer service and satisfaction. Furthermore, outsourcing will allow ESI to allocate more capital to marketing and market already. allow the company to compete with the well-established companies that exist in the Outsourcing will bring about risks for the company that may affect its

This would surely be detrimental to ESI's survival as under sell their products to capture the market.

will more likely not require the addition of one or two workstations and will most likely work with the existing production layout and resources. The model that requires additional workstations would require ESI to make a significant investment of adding workstations, which is not feasible at this time due to lack of capital availability. The second alternative model involving more risk may be mitigated and

include either a full in-house production or the hybrid model mentioned above. This would allow ESI to focus its available cash and capital on market capture. Placing a time restriction on outsourcing the company's core capability may also reduce the and expand its production at a later date. risk.

Through implementing a mathematical or solutions were recommended. simulation model of the proposed question, an analysis and assessment of potential The ESI and Manet case studies show that small businesses are unique in the

way they operate and set goals. Similarly, while most companies' goal is to grow and
