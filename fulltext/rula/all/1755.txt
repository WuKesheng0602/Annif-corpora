Using a High Repetition Rate Nd:YAG Laser for Pulsed Laser Ablation Propulsion  Master of Applied Science  In the program of  Aerospace Engineering  2010    Daniel Hayek  School of Graduate Studies  Ryerson University 

Abstract 
Laser propulsion is a relatively new technology being researched for its vast potential.  A test apparatus  was developed to measure small forces using piezoelectric films and a developed amplifier tuned to the  specific frequencies expected from the system.  The system provided consistent results comparable to  published values.    The tests conducted in this thesis evaluated the effects of using a high repetition rate laser for laser  propulsion.  The results are on the micropropulsion scale, however, the findings are expected to  perform similarly on a larger scale.  The thrust, moment coupling coefficient, and specific impulse values  were evaluated for aluminum, brass, and PVC of differing thicknesses.  The results concluded that the  repetition rate in fact did not have much effect on the thrust; thrust was primarily dependent on the  pulse energy and the material thickness.  The repetition rate was found to affect the specific impulse  values; a result of the heat affected zone created by the laser ablation, thereby reducing the effective  propellant used for propulsion.

Chapter 1: Research Motivation and Objectives 
1.1 Introduction to Laser Micropropulsion 

Laser propulsion was first proposed by Dr. Arthur Kantrowitz in 1972 [1] with the idea of using a ground  based high power laser to propel a flying object.  The Myrabo Laser Lightcraft, designed by Larson et al,  uses Kantrowitz's theory and has achieved lift off using a high power CO2 laser [2].  Laser Ablation Propulsion is a relatively new form of electric micropropulsion that has great potential  due to the high efficiency of energy conversion.  Micro propulsion is being developed for satellite  maneuverability.  Smaller satellites can be maneuvered with very small thrust pulses while in orbit,  requiring a small amount of propellant for each maneuver.  Other propulsion methods, such as  chemical, solid and hybrid rockets, cannot be efficiently applied to a small satellite system as they  require much more propellant than electric propulsion methods.    Lasers can produce large amounts of power in very short pulses making them useful for thruster  applications where specific amounts of thrust are required [3].  This is best used for maneuvering due to  the relatively low amount of power available at this point in time when compared to a chemical rocket.   Laser propulsion dominates with respect to specific impulse, Isp, and moment coupling coefficient, Cm,  over chemical rocket propulsion.  Specific impulse values for chemical rockets are typically limited to  around 500s because of available reaction temperatures; lasers do not have a temperature limit, and  thus Isp values greater than 5000s are attainable [4].  Laser light can be focused to a very small point greatly increasing the density of the light beam [3]; this  implies that more energy deposited in the material will increase the exhaust velocity of the particles and  could provide more thrust.  For the same amount of thrust, less propellant could be used due to  focusing the laser energy [5].  Obviously, a higher power laser could produce very high energy densities  when focused, but this also means that very small lasers can produce sufficient amounts of energy  required for ablation.  Benefits to using a smaller, low powered laser are that total mass requirements  may be low and thus a lightweight diode laser could be used.    Satellite lifetime is currently propellant limited.  If the amount of propellant onboard can be increased  then the satellite lifetime can in turn be increased, thus decreasing costs for satellite replacement [6].

Many polymers have been tested for thrust generation and have been found to produce a generous  amount of thrust when compared to metals.  For example, to reach the ignition threshold of polymer  materials used for micro propulsion requires just over 1W of laser energy.  For optimum moment  coefficient values, a laser above 5W could be used [7].   

1.2

Purpose for Laser Micropropulsion Research 

Space exploration and the satellite industry is one of extreme expense.  For example, the costs of  sending a satellite into geosynchronous orbit were upwards of $30,000 per kilogram in 2001 [6].  Thrust  values are still fairly low to actually transport the system to orbit from earth with an onboard laser, but  are able to supply sufficient impulse for maneuvering.  Electric propulsion and laser propulsion are  sought after for their high specific impulse potential, which is regarded as the efficiency of an engine or  rocket.  It is effectively the change in impulse per unit weight of propellant.  Micropropulsion is a viable  means for satellite maneuvering due to its low system weight and energy requirements. 

1.3

Micropropulsion Review 

In 1958, Explorer I, and Vanguard I were the first microsatellites weighing in at 15kg and 1.5kg  respectively [8].  As communications technology advanced, satellite pointing and station keeping  became crucial.  The requirement for systems to be able to maneuver a microsatellite efficiently was  essential, and is still researched extensively to find more efficient methods.  Generally, a satellite's  lifetime is limited to the amount of propellant onboard.  If the total impulse is increased to keep the  satellite in orbit for a longer period of time, it would reduce hefty launch costs.  The total impulse is the  maximum amount of impulse that the system can provide over its operational lifetime.  The other  important parameter is the impulse bit, which is effectively the smallest amount of thrust that can be  generated over the shortest period of time the propulsion system can fire [8].  This is important for  precision maneuvering, and pulsed systems are best fit for these applications [6].  Micropropulsion is  achieved by many different methods.  This section outlines several types of micropropulsion systems  and explains basic operation, as well as some benefits and performance data.    1.3.1 Electric Propulsion 

Electric propulsion encompasses any propulsion technology that uses electricity to increase exhaust  velocity [9].  Electric propulsion aims to increase the exhaust velocity to reduce the amount of  propellant required to achieve the required mission thrust [9].   

2   

Several different technologies have been developed to produce low milliNewton thrust levels.  The  three types of electric propulsion are electrothermal, electrostatic, and electromagnetic.  1.3.1.1 Electrothermal Thrusters  Electrothermal propulsion is achieved by electrically heating the propellant and allowing the exhaust to  thermally expand, typically through a nozzle.  The resistojet and the arcjet are two types of  electrothermal propulsion.  The resistojet heats the propellant via convection by passing electricity  through a high resistance component and dissipating energy.  Resistojet performance is around 300mN,  with specific impulse values around 300s.  The arcjet passes an electric current through a gas propellant,  and can either use a nozzle or a magnetic field, at which point it would be categorized as an  electromagnetic thruster.  Arcjet thrust levels are around 250mN, with 600s specific impulse  measurements.    The resistojet and arcjet require approximately 500W and 2kW of power onboard respectively [6].  1.3.1.2 Electrostatic Thrusters  Electrostatic propulsion operates by accelerating charged particles by electric and magnetic fields.   Three types of electrostatic propulsion systems are: 1) electron bombardment thrusters, 2) ion contact  thrusters, and 3) field emission thrusters.  The electron bombardment thruster bombards a monatomic  gas or vapor with electrons to produce positive ions.  Ion contact thrusters produce positive ions by  passing the propellant vapor through a 1100oC porous tungsten contact ionizer.  The field emission  thrusters produce positive or negative ions by passing propellant droplets through an intense electric  field discharge.    Electric thrusters aim to be energy efficient by converting energy into charged particles [6].  They  typically produce thrust levels less than 1mN, which makes them useful for precision control of satellites  [9].  1.3.1.3 Electromagnetic Thrusters  Electromagnetic thrusters accelerate plasma by electric and magnetic fields.  Plasma is predominantly  electrically neutral, and makes a good electrical conductor.  Electrostatic thrusters accelerate charged  particles, and electromagnetic thrusters accelerate electrically neutral plasma.  Electromagnetic  thrusters are pulsed plasma thrusters, ion thrusters, and Hall thrusters.  Pulsed plasma thrusters (PPT)  use a Faraday accelerator concept to accelerate the plasma.  The plasma is accelerated by passing a  current in the direction of an applied electric field, perpendicular to the magnetic field [6].  PPTs have  3   

specific impulse values around 1000s [9].  Ion thrusters ionize large portions of propellant and then  electrostatically extract ions from the propellant using biased grids and accelerate them to high  velocities.  Ion thrusters have high specific impulses from 2000s to 10,000s [9].  The Hall thruster  requires low plasma densities and a high electric field to be effective since collisions must remain low for  proper operation.  This is due to the crossed electric and magnetic field, and the chance for shorting to  occur in the electric field [6].  Thrust output for the Hall thruster is higher than the ion thruster.  Hall  thrusters typically achieve specific impulses of 2000s [9].  1.3.2 MEMSBased Thrusters 

MEMS thrusters are generally categorized as micro rockets.  Micro fabrication makes the manufacturing  of microthrusters possible.  Micro rockets are currently a onetime use system where an array of micro  rockets is fabricated into the satellite for control.  As the rocket fires the solid propellant, that cell is no  longer usable.  This is the issue with using solid rockets and micro rockets for micro satellites as the  amount of movements available is limited to the size of the rocket array since the solid rocket cannot be  refired once used [10].  The solid propellant inside the chamber of the rocket is electrically ignited by a  high resistance component within the chamber.  A MEMS microthruster designed by Zhang et al. used  gunpowder as the solid propellant and achieved peak thrust values of 0.050.34N with specific impulse  values of 2.6814.65s [10].  An image of their microthruster is shown below in Figure 11.

MEMS microthrusters are wellsuited for thrust production for maneuvering, but the specific impulse  values show that the effective thrust to propellant weight ratio of this system is not comparable to most  electric propulsion systems.  Chaalane et al. measured thrust levels of 0.11mN, so it is possible to  achieve smaller impulse values [11].  These values depend on the size and geometry of the thruster and  the propellant choice.  The drawback of having unusable weight after the rocket fires is still an issue with  these types of thrusters.  1.3.3 Laser Ablation Microthrusters 

Laser Ablation Propulsion is a relatively new form of micropropulsion which uses energy from the laser  light to thermally heat a propellant to a temperature that surpasses its irradiance threshold and  converts the thermal energy to kinetic energy via a thermal plasma expansion.  For comparison, laser  ablation thrusters for satellite applications have generated thrust levels at the nN level, and have  achieved specific impulses of 20,000s with Aluminum and Carbon propellants.  Thrust levels can be  dramatically changed depending on the laser parameters and the type of propellant used.   

1.4

Benefits to Laser Ablation Thrusters 

Compared to the other technologies, laser ablation thrusters are capable of a wider range of thrust  production.  The ability to also use the same system to produce low precision thrust or high thrust  values for larger movements is possible.  The length of life of a laser propulsion system is greater than  MEMSbased systems and comparable to electric propulsion sources.  Use of laser propulsion for light  craft and satellite transport is also possible using an external independent laser, which makes laser  propulsion even more intriguing for its applicability to future systems.  One interesting setup has a high  power laser in space that would provide energy to surrounding satellites equipped with lenses and  propellant, shown below in Figure 12 [12].

1.4.1

Important Laser Parameters for Evaluation 

Laser parameters that are important for propulsion are the pulse width, pulse energy, intensity, and  repetition rate, all of which are described later in this report in the Laser Parameters for Propulsion  section.  Pulse width is the length of the pulse given in seconds, defined by a timedistance relation.  The  pulse energy defines how much energy is in each pulse, defined by the repetition rate and the average  power of the laser.  The intensity is important as it essentially defines the ablation potential of the laser  with the material.  Repetition rate is the rate of pulses exiting the laser cavity, given as a frequency.  It  defines the amount of time between laser pulses.  Repetition rate will increase the average power of the  laser, but decrease the pulse energy.  Recent studies have used lasers with very low repetition rates due  to the high peak power available at lower repetition rates.  It is necessary, conversely, to evaluate the  effects of laser ablation propulsion at high repetition rates.  1.4.1.1 Laser Parameters and Methods for Testing Influence  For the tests conducted in this work, a 10 Watt diode pumped Nd:YAG laser with dual wavelength; 532  and 1064, 20ns pulse width, and repetition rate from 10kHz to 70kHz is used.  The power is variable via  6   

diode pumping power regulation from 010W, and the repetition rate can be adjusted within the 10kHz  to 70kHz range.  The repetition rate cannot be reduced below 10kHz as the laser crystal would be in  danger of cracking.  In order to test for thrust output variations due to these laser parameters, the  repetition rate will be tested for each power level as is defined in the Test Apparatus Development  section of this report.  The setup developed is able to test for thrust variations due to laser power levels,  and repetition rate changes.  Various groups have developed testing methods that are able to attain  fairly accurate results, typically using a pendulum or weight balance system in a vacuum.  Another  method used by some groups is direct force measurement.  These groups also typically use an ICCD  camera to capture plasma images to estimate exhaust velocities.    1.4.2 Experimental Review 

1.4.2.1 Luke & Phipps, 2003  A setup by Luke & Phipps incorporates a roll of transparent material with fuel attached that is ablated by  the laser to create thrust.    The test apparatus was designed using a torsion pendulum style hanging on a steel wire with a  counterweight balancing the system.  The entire stand was placed in a vacuum chamber.  The amount of  torsion induced on the wire was calibrated using a magnetic coil, and the amount of thrust could be  measured using a flag pendulum that would catch the plasma shock front.  The issue with this method of  thrust evaluation is that the flag pendulum is not a reliable or consistent method of measurement as the  plume was sometimes not caught by the flag.  Their measurements could resolve a 20N force.  The  given laser parameters are shown in Table 11.

Luke & Phipps found that running the laser at longer pulse widths in their system allowed for thrust  vectoring as the fuel was being fed perpendicular to the laser beam.  They estimated 50 to 60 degrees of  thrust vectoring is possible by increasing the pulse width.   Thrust vectoring occurs when the laser is  used in continuous wave mode, due to the laser ablating faster than the tape can travel, which causes a  flame front as shown in Figure 13.   

 
Figure 13: Thrust Vectoring [13] 

This phenomenon can be prevented by using a pulsed laser, with the option of thrust vectoring if  required by altering pulse length.  Experimented dimensions of the substrate and fuel are 100m and  60m respectively with a width of 1" [14]  1.4.2.2 Phipps, Luke, Helgeson, & Johnson, 2006  This experiment used a ns pulsed laser with pulse widths of 44.55ns, pulse energy of approximately  20J, and spot size of 520m.  The laser was fired at a gold coated spinning hard drive disk at 8kHz.  The  test parameters are very similar to those used in this thesis, however the repetition rate is used to be  able to fire quickly enough to ablate the spinning disk.  An interesting result from these tests is the  differing specific impulse values, shown in Table 13 below for an aluminum coating.  Specific impulse is  defined as the ratio of impulse generated to the weight of the ablated propellant per pulse.

This data demonstrates the difference in the specific impulse using different calculation methods [15].   The data will be compared to those calculated in this thesis as the laser parameters are similar.  8   

1.4.2.3 Horisawa & Kimura, 2002  In Fundamental Study of Laser Plasma Accelerator for Propulsion Applications, Horisawa & Kimura used  a pendulum system to measure thrust.  The pendulum held a sample at the bottom that was ablated by  the laser.  As the pendulum was displaced, another low power laser reflected off of the sample onto a  surface that showed the amount the pendulum displaced.  They used thin enough samples to test for  transmission mode ablation propulsion.  They noticed that some of their values were very low, and that  a crater was forming on the front implying that a plume was generating on both sides essentially  equalizing the thrust on both sides [16].  They noticed low thrust values with low absorption rate  materials and low incident power.  When the material was doped to increase the absorption coefficient,  the thrust values went up by an order of magnitude [16].  Data from their tests are given below in Table  14 [16].

Table 14: Horisawa, Kimura, 2002 Test Data 

Fluence is the amount of energy per unit area of the laser beam, defined as the pulse energy divided by  the focal spot cross sectional area.  An impulse bit is defined as the smallest amount of impulse possible  from a propulsion system.  This is an important quantity for micropropulsion systems that require  precise movements.    1.4.2.4 Pakhomov, Gregory & Thompson, 2002  Pakhomov et al. demonstrated a time of flight (TOF) measurement [17].  They proposed that short pulse  widths below 100ps should be used for ablative laser propulsion, due to the theory that the ablation  duration and plasma lifetime are around 1s [17].  From their experiments they stated that high density  plasma must be developed in order for ablation to be the main contributor for momentum transfer,  which implies that laser pulse duration should be set by the amount of time required for high density  plasma to develop.  Their given laser parameters are shown in Table 15.

The TOF measurement was done by placing two copper plates downstream of the ablation both  connected to an oscilloscope.  They could then determine approximate particle velocity as the particles  from the wave front hit both plates with the time difference between successive impacts.  Using this  method requires a maintained vacuum to allow the particles to travel relatively uninterrupted.  Their  goal was to determine accurate specific impulse values and compare those to their other works, as well  as other published data.  They found that specific impulse values decreased gradually with consecutive  pulses fired at a lead target.  They also found that specific impulses were higher for lighter atomic mass  unit propellants.  They noted that with a focal distance change from 20mm50mm there was no  significant change in specific impulse.  Data from their testing included aluminum having an impulse of  300nNs, with a mass material removal rate of 0.20.3g/pulse.  Carbon had mass removal rates of  approximately 0.15g/pulse.  Copper samples reached 55km/s, and a very high 20 000s specific impulse  was recorded for Carbon samples [17].    1.4.2.5 Pakhomov, Thompson, Swift & Gregory, 2002  Pakhomov et al. [18] in another experiment used a direct force measurement piezoelectric sensor made  by PCB Piezotronics, Inc.  The sample was placed directly on top of the sensor and was fired at using a  similar laser used as that described in Table 15.  The pulse energy was reduced to 8mJ in these tests.   They found that the material removal rate was twice as high in vacuum than in atmospheric conditions,  due to material deposition from atmospheric pressure [18].  They also found that the material removal  rate was generally lower for lighter atomic mass propellants.  For the metals they tested, they found  moment coupling coefficients in the range of 2080N/W [18].  The moment coupling coefficient (Cm) is  the ratio of impulse to laser pulse energy, per pulse, for ablation of the propellant.  1.4.2.6 Maesato, Koizumi, & Tahara, 2006  In Performance Characteristics of LowPower Laser Ablative Thrusters for Small Satellites, an Nd:YAG  laser with wavelength of 1064nm, pulse width of 6ns, and an output energy of 0.65J is used to generate  thrust from various polymers.  The testing was conducted at 103torr using a pendulum system with an  electromagnetic damper and counterweight balance.  Their testing results of the polymers are given  below in Table 16.

Maesato et al. noted that after the first shot to the polymers the moment coupling coefficient decreased  rapidly with each successive shot.  They proposed that the laser pulse increased the porosity of the  material, and in turn reduced the absorption efficiency of the laser pulse to the solid propellant [19].  1.4.2.7 Yokoyama, Horisawa, Funaki, Kuninaka, 2007  In Fundamental Study of Laser Micro Propulsion Using PowderedPropellant, an investigation on the  thrust production with a powdered propellant was conducted.  In the tests a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a  wavelength of 1064nm, pulse width of 10ns, and pulse energy of 400mJ was used.  The tests were  conducted in a vacuum chamber at 103torr and used a pendulum mass type target with a displacement  sensor behind the sample area.  They used the plasma plume to imply a force on the sample area; the  data is given below in Table 17 [20].

Table 17: Yokoyama, Horisawa, Funaki, & Kuninaka, 2007 Test Data 

The data ranges are due to pulse energy changes.  It is noted that the cellophane tape experiment  absorbs laser energy but does not contribute to thrust and should be avoided.  Using a transparent  substrate may be the only means to holding a sample, but the purpose should obviously be very  significant if thrust generation is being sacrificed.  These testing methods are all good options to evaluate various thrust parameters.  Use of a direct force  measurement method is thought to be the best option but is typically costly.  Using the method outlined 

11   

in this report has been very cost effective, and appropriate results compared to those published have  been gathered from testing. 

1.5

New Trends in Micropropulsion Research 

New trends in research for laser micropropulsion and for laser propulsion are focused on shorter pulse  widths and more energetic material compositions.  Using femtosecond laser pulse widths has reduced  the plasma pulse energy absorption due to the pulse fully entering the material before the plasma  plume is generated.  As laser technology advances, higher power lasers are available and are being used  to conduct experiments as well.  Cai et al. found that irregularly shaped holes from ablation occurred  due to their lower power laser.  They propose that an inhomogeneous energy distribution is attributed  to intensities that are too low for the material's ablation [21].  For satellite use, higher power diode  lasers are being tested with various materials for systems that would require the laser to be onboard the  craft.  Investigations on the use of nozzles and magnetic fields are also ongoing to increase the specific  impulse of the propulsion system.  Other research on light craft where the laser source would be independent of the craft is also being  conducted for various purposes.  Higher power lasers could be used to transport satellites and craft to  space, but would be left on earth or would already be in space due to their weight and size.   

1.6

Objectives of This Work 

High repetition rate kHz Nanosecond lasers have not been extensively studied for laser propulsion.  The  objective of this work is to test kHz nanosecond laser parameters' effects on micropropulsion by altering  the repetition rate and laser power during testing.  The ability to test a new range of parameters for  laser micropropulsion is a very beneficial contribution to this new field.  Along with these tests several  materials will be tested and the damaging effects the laser power and repetition rate have on the  material will be evaluated due to the typical assumption that all propellant is usable for the propulsion  system.  During the design of the testing apparatus, it is required to develop a sensor system.  So as another  contribution to this thesis a new method for testing micropropulsion using piezoelectric sensors will be  developed and tested.

Chapter 2: Laser Background and Principles 
The applicability of the laser has been constantly growing over the last half century.  Within the last 20  years different chemical compounds for various types of lasers have been discovered, and their  potential for power output has also increased.  New methods for light intensity growth, along with  higher repetition rates, have given the laser greater ability to be used for new objectives.    Lasers have great applicability for thruster use.  The efficient conversion of electrical energy to thrust is  what is sought after in propulsion applications.  The manufacturing industry also benefits greatly from  laser ablation, as certain materials are not easily drilled by normal methods.  For instance, drilling  through rubber or diamond is very difficult without the use of a laser, which can cut through these  materials very easily [22].    Having a basic understanding of how the laser functions, and the different methods available to increase  beam power are important to continue with research of a laser ablation topic.  This section will focus on  the laser cavity and its components, how the cavity intensifies the beam, and how the beam can then be  focused to a spot.  Different types of lasers will also be discussed, along with their common applications.  

2.1

Laser Operation 

The laser consists of several main components that intensify light via a source, also called a pump.  The  pump stimulates atoms in the parent medium.  Light intensity will continue to grow within the laser  cavity, reflecting axially between mirrors on both sides of the medium [23].  Light intensity growth  occurs by stimulated emission.  When energetic light is directed on a material, there is a transition of  electrons from occupied spaces below Fermi energy to unoccupied spaces above Fermi energy [24].  As  electrons decay to their lower energy levels they emit photons, which then stimulate other atoms within  the laser cavity [22].  This well describes the acronym, LASER: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission  of Radiation.     The energy that is released as light during stimulation comes from a phenomenon known as population  inversion.   Laser operation not only consists of stimulating light emission, but also intensifying it by  inducing coherence using methods such as Qswitching, and mode locking.  The average power of a laser  is the beam area multiplied by the laser intensity [25].   

13   

2.1.1

Coherence 

Coherence is achieved when the laser is oscillating in one mode, implying that any two points along the  beam will constantly be in phase [26].  Having the beam oscillate in one mode provides more power  than there would be if the beam were oscillating in multiple modes.   When multiple modes are present,  the interference caused by the waves overlapping can cause dark spots in the material the laser beam is  being shot at [27].  Dark spots imply low power regions of the beams cross section.    Coherence length and time are important characteristics of the laser beam.  The coherence time is the  amount of time the laser beam can travel before it loses phase continuity, and the coherence length is  the distance the beam can travel as a result [27].    2.1.2 QSwitching and Mode Locking 

Qswitching greatly enhances the applicability of the laser by allowing the intensity to grow within the  laser cavity before releasing the beam, which is called a Pulsed Laser.  During the process, a DC voltage is  applied, rotating the polarization of the light by 90o [23].  A polarizer placed before the front mirror  reflects the light back towards the back mirror, where it could also then be mode locked.  Mode locking  happens by bouncing the light off of a back mirror where gain modulation attempts to lock the waves  into a single mode by changing their phase.  The light will continue to travel axially within the cavity  while stimulating other atoms and gaining intensity.  Once the DC pulse stops polarizing the light, the  laser beam exits the cavity [23].    2.1.3 Monochromaticity 

Monochromatic light means that only a single line in the light spectrum was emitted by the laser cavity  [28], implying that the laser only emits a single wavelength [27].  However, it is fairly implausible, and in  a realistic sense monochromatic light is impossible [26]. 

2.2

Types of Lasers 

The pulsed laser was briefly described in the previous section, but they will be discussed here for the  sake of comparison with a continuous wave (CW) laser.  Several different types of lasers with respect to  chemical composition and state will also be discussed.  2.2.1 Pulsed Laser 

A pulsed laser emits pulses of beamed light at a rate typically determined by a function generator, and a  pulse width which can be regulated by Qswitching.  The NdYAG laser (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet doped  with Neodymium) is an example of a solid state pulsed laser, which can emit a laser power greater than  14   

a MW in nanosecond pulses.  If the same laser is used in continuous wave mode, powers slightly more  than 10W are attainable [23].  This shows that the pulsed laser can have a much higher peak power than  the continuous wave laser [28].  2.2.2 Femtosecond and Nanosecond Pulsed Lasers 

Pulsed lasers have several main components which transfer the energy of the beam and amplify it to  levels that the oscillator could not safely do on its own.  The oscillator produces regular low energy short  pulses that are sent to a stretcher, which then converts the femtosecond pulse into a 50200ps chirped  pulse [29].  A chirped pulse is one where the instantaneous pulse is red in the front and blue at the back  [30].  The wave then passes through several amplification stages to increase its pulse energy by a factor  of 107109.  A compressor then works to transmit the amplified pulse of the same duration that the  oscillator output.  Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA), as shown below in Figure 21, is a method to  ensure the components remain undamaged, as they would be damaged if the oscillator output that  much energy to the amplifier [29].   

 
Figure 21: Chirped Pulse Amplification Operation Diagram [31] 

  Pulse duration is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the pulse, which implies that a large  bandwidth is required to create a short pulse.  Femtosecond lasers are typically TiSapphire due to its  large bandwidth, high damage threshold, and saturation fluence of 1[J/cm2].  A femtosecond pulse  typically contains a few nanojoules of energy, which can be amplified by quite a bit with use of  diffraction gratings.  Diffraction gratings "stretch" the pulse by a factor of 103 or 104, and impose a  positive chirp so the longer wavelengths emerge before the shorter ones [29].    Large power lasers are currently in existence, and larger ones are being manufactured.  With laser  powers exceeding a petawatt, the amount of energy available can easily damage the laser components.  

15   

The safest way to increase power without damaging these components is to further shorten the pulse  length [29].  This will allow a greater amount of output energy from a relatively low amount of energy  input.  2.2.2.1 Femtosecond and Nanosecond Ablation  Within the ablation process, heat conduction away from the affected zone is an issue.  The laser heating  source term, S, is given in Equation (2.1) below [32].  The equation describes how the laser intensity and  absorption coefficient directly relate to the material heating.

(2.2) 

For ultra short laser pulses, often defined by pulses shorter than 100ps, the pulse is too short to allow  for heat conduction to the surrounding zone [34].  This is due to the pulse fully entering the material  before the electrons and ions are able to equalize, called the electronion relaxation time.  Due to the  pulse penetrating the material before the ablation begins [35], the electrons reach very high energies,  and the lattice and ion energies are much lower than that of the electrons [36].  The subsequent  electronion energy transfer very quickly heats the material to a very high temperature, much higher  than that of longer pulses.  The material quickly vaporizes, but the heat affected volume is much smaller  with femtosecond laser pulses [36].  This reduces the amount of energy lost within the ablation process,  and also gets rid of the surrounding zone being damaged by the laser pulse.  For manufacturing  purposes, it is very important to reduce damaged zones by heat.  For propulsion purposes, it is not as  much of an issue to have a heat affected zone.  However, it could potentially damage the propellant or  create some porosity.  Nanosecond pulsed lasers are considered too short to bypass the surrounding  zone being affected by heat conduction.  Often nanosecond pulsed lasers are partially absorbed by the  expanding plume, which is considered laser supported detonation (LSD).    Nanosecond pulsed diode pumped fiber laser amplifiers are capable of efficiencies greater than 40% and  are low mass devices, which make them very applicable for micro propulsion use [7].  Fiber lasers  currently are capable of delivering 25kW peak power, with 10ns pulse widths at 100kHz, delivering an 

16   

average power of 25W [37].  Microchip lasers on the other hand have efficiencies of 12% because most  of the power available is required for chip cooling [7].    2.2.3 Continuous Wave Laser 

A continuous wave laser is constantly under steady pumping, outputting a continuous beam with no  breaks [23].  The output power that results is less due to the inability for the intensity to grow very much  before the beam exits the laser cavity.  The decay rate is such that the laser can maintain a lower power  beam than if it were pulsed.    2.2.4 SolidState Lasers 

Solidstate lasers consist of a transparent crystal or glass rod with the ability to remove unwanted heat,  and can undergo stimulated emission.  The host materials are the majority of the rod, but the active  substance in the material is typically 50% of the material composition, this is also called the dopant [22].   Some doping substances used are Chromium, Uranium, and Neodymium.  Solid state lasers use a flash  lamp or a diode as a pumping source with a reflective inner cavity, which encounters significant losses  [23].    2.2.4.1 Ruby Laser  The Single Crystal Ruby laser is no longer a widely used solid state laser.  This is due to the low  overall system efficiency.  The laser requires a large amount of pumping to initiate population  inversion and in turn activate stimulation [38].  It's comprised of Aluminum Oxide as the host  doped with Chromium atoms.  The Chromium atoms emit red light when stimulated by green  light [22].  The Ruby laser typically emits a light wavelength of 694nm.   2.2.4.2 Nd:YAG  The neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser can emit light wavelengths of 1.06Âµm to  1.32Âµm [28].  Nd:YAG is the most commonly used laser due to its high gain capabilities.   Neodymium doped lasers are good for diode use as they have a high upper level lifetime,  requiring less power from the pumping source [38].   2.2.4.3 Nd:YVO4  Neodymium doped Yttrium Orthovanadate is often used for diode and microchip lasers.  The  material has strong absorption abilities at a wavelength of 809nm [38].  The material is good for  diodes due to the higher efficiency, and low power requirement from the pumping source [38].  

17   

This is due to the fact that diode laser systems typically do not have much pumping power  available.  2.2.5 Liquid Lasers 

Liquid and dye lasers are not very common.  The dye laser is comprised of organic substances as the  active ingredient; water, ethanol, benzene, methanol, acetone etc. [27].  The liquid laser and the solid state laser operate in a similar manner.  2.2.6 Gas Laser 

Gas lasers briefly described in this section are classified by their mediums; atomic lasers, ion lasers,  molecular lasers, and excimer lasers.  2.2.6.1 Atomic Lasers  HeNe gas laser is an example of an atomic laser with a wavelength of 633nm.  It is small, cheap  and, as a result, is usually used for optical experiments, measurements, or display purposes [28].   Argon lasers have the ability to retain a coherent beam that is more powerful than the HeNe  beam, and can attain wavelengths of visible light from light green to deep blue [23].   2.2.6.2 Molecular Lasers  N2 is an example of a molecular laser, which emits ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 337nm.   These lasers are typically used for infrared research [28].   2.2.6.3 Excimer Lasers  Xe2 is an excimer gas laser emitting a light wavelength of 173nm.  These are typically used for  photochemical research [28].  2.2.7 Semiconductor Lasers 

Optoelectronic applications and micro electronics benefit from the semiconductor laser, which typically  has dimensions of 1mm x 1mm x 1Âµm.  Semiconductor host materials include Germanium, and Silicon.   The semiconductor laser uses dopants called ptype, ntype, and pntype.  Semiconductor lasers can  also be pumped by another laser, often a crystal diode laser [27]. 

2.3

Diode Lasers 

The diode laser is a very small, low power laser that has many applications such as laser ablation  propulsion on a satellite, laser pointers, CD and DVD players, etc.  They are typically used when weight,  size, and power availability are critical.  In the past, the low power output of most diode lasers generally  18   

did not allow them to ablate metals, which limited their ablation uses.  If used for propulsion, polymers  were used as the propellant due to the fluence produced by low power, long pulse width lasers.  Recent  advancements in diode laser technology have boosted peak power and reducing pulse width, increasing  their usability for micropropulsion.  Using a nanosecond pulsed laser instead of a ms pulsed laser would  require approximately 500 times less fluence on the target, which implies both a larger distance  allowable between the lens and the target and a lower power laser can be used [39].  For  micropropulsion, diode lasers and fiber lasers are essential due to their compactness.  Light weight  diode lasers are able to deliver sufficient power to ablate most propellants to generate thrust  requirements for precision maneuvering on nanosatellites.  Diode technology for micropropulsion is  described later in this section.    Other applications of diode lasers are for pumping sources.  NdYAG microchip lasers have been pumped  using diode lasers, which then could output high enough power levels to ablate metals [40].  Diode  pumped lasers are able to achieve repetition rates of 1 to 2 magnitudes higher than flash lamp pumped  lasers due to their reduced heating of the laser gain medium [41].  Laser ablation requires that the binding energy of the material be surpassed by the laser beam energy.   Typically for laser cutting, or laser ablation processes, a pulsed laser will be used to attain high enough  energy densities [40].  Diode lasers are not typically capable of achieving these intensity levels.  For laser  micropropulsion, the system would use a diode laser as an energy source due to the low weight  requirements of the satellite.    Recent uses of diode lasers also include power beaming.  Power beaming uses high power lasers to  transfer power from one location to another.  This is useful for applications where power lines are not  possible or feasible, for instance, a moving object with an electric motor.  The laser energy charges  batteries onboard the device, and the batteries power an electric motor.  The laser could also power the  object directly.  Recent advancements in diode technology have made using diode lasers more  applicable for a space elevator design.  Amplified power output of over 3.5kW is possible using stacked  diode arrays [42].  Another use of a stacked diode array was used as a diode pumping source for a  terawatt laser developed by Siebold et al. that outputs 85fs length pulses [43].  A laser with this power  level capability could be used to provide propulsion to a craft or satellite hundreds of kilometers away.    2.3.1 Wavelengths of Diode Lasers 

Laser wavelength is an important factor for propellant material choices and diode types.  There are  many different lasing materials that can be used in the diodes, so propellants are not limited to the  19   

wavelength of the specific diode.  Wavelengths of 447nm to 900nm are possible by changing the diode  material.  For instance, a Zinc Selenide diode would produce a 447nm wavelength light, and a Gallium  Arsenide diode laser would produce a 900nm wavelength light [3].  Diodes can also use frequency  doubling to reduce the wavelength if required, but can create inefficiencies if not focused to high  intensities [3].  2.3.2 Diode Lasers for Micropropulsion 

Diode lasers are useful for satellite applications because they are capable of being made very small and  lightweight.  This is due to the high gain materials used for diode lasers, which allow them to have  smaller than normal cavities being around 300 Â­ 500m long [3].  Having a smaller laser allows for a  lighter satellite that reduces launch costs and propellant requirements as well.  Diode lasers are also  known for their high efficiency which reduces energy requirements.  Energy storage for communications  could be shared with the energy storage for the laser and could thus reduce weight even further.  Diode  lasers with output powers of 1[W] or greater typically have efficiencies of approximately 50% [40].  Diode lasers are also capable of being used in conjunction with one another to increase power output.   Being able to use multiple smaller, lower power, lasers together to create one output beam can be  beneficial to instances that require higher thrust output but still require a low weight design.  Luke et al  replaced a single laser with four fiber coupled lasers capable of an output power of 14[W] pulses [14].   Laser beam width contributes greatly to the energy density potential with the use of lenses to focus on a  single spot.  If the output power of the laser is increased by increasing the width of the cavity, then more  energy can be focused on a spot.  The problem with diode lasers is that if the cavity width is increased  too much then internal cross lasing can occur within the structure due to the diode sidewalls.  Typically,  emission widths on diodes are 75 Â­ 600 [m], but with reduced diode sidewalls, emission widths as large  as 1500 [m] have been made [44].  Recently, methods to increase power output and reduce pulse width for diode lasers have been  researched.  Ulm et al. developed a master oscillator power amplifier system for a 920nm wavelength to  achieve pulse widths as short as 267fs with an average power of 708mW and a peak power of 661W, at  a repetition rate of 3.3GHz and pulse energy of 213pJ [45].  This was done by compressing picoseconds  pulses that are output from an oscillator to femtosecond pulses post amplifier.  High power diode lasers  are also being developed for many applications.  Fiebig et al. developed a distributed Bragg reflector  tapered diode laser to output 12W of optical power, at 44% conversion efficiency.  The diode laser  outputs a wavelength of 979nm [46].  The benefit to the design by Fiebig et al. is that it retains its  20   

compactness, while many other developments have increased in size and weight.  Power conversion  efficiency (PCE) is a highly sought after parameter for researchers developing diode lasers.  The efficient  conversion of electrical energy to light energy can enable higher power lasers to be designed and used  for applications due to the lower amount of energy required for cooling and pumping.  Cai and Kanskar  have developed a continuous wave (CW) laser that has a PCE of 67%.  The laser operates at 1060nm,  and has a steady heat sink temperature of 25oC, which shows that it is a stable design.  They used an  aluminum free material (GaAs) system which they state reduced the facet temperature rise by an order  of magnitude when compared to diode systems using AlGaAs [47].

Chapter 3: Fundamentals of Laser Ablation Propulsion 
Laser ablation of a material can differ greatly depending on the following laser pulse parameters; pulse  duration, pulse frequency, pulse energy, and wavelength.  For example, long pulse ablation involves  evaporating the material while short pulse ablation is governed by hydrodynamic motion [48].   Hydrodynamic motion is caused by thermal expansion of the material while energy from the laser is  being absorbed.  When hydrodynamic motion begins it creates a plume and a crater, which both  expand.  This is a phase transfer of the solid directly into hot, radiant, expanding plasma [18].  The  temperature distribution within the material is non uniform at the beginning of the hydrodynamic  motion, and the temperature of the material decreases with depth due to conduction losses [48].      Laser ablation for nanosecond or longer pulses generally occurs in three stages [49].  The first stage is  the solid material absorbing the laser beam.  This causes a large amount of heating due to the amount  of energy being irradiated on the material.  Stage two involves material being ejected while continuing  to absorb energy from the laser.  This stage contains lasergas and laserplasma interactions as the  material is being ejected.  The ejected matter is known as plasma.  Femtosecond laser pulses do not  have this stage while interacting with material since the pulse is so quick that all material is ejected as  plasma after the pulse has finished being absorbed [49][50].  Stage three begins when the pulse  interaction ends.  During this stage a plume expands adiabatically from the surface of the material.  The  plume is often used for many different purposes.  It can be used to place a thin film of material on a  body opposite the material being ablated, called sputtering.  It could also be used for micro propulsion  to produce thrust necessary for satellite maneuvering.      The laser energy absorbed in stage one is by electrons transferring heat through cold material with  conduction.  There is an exchange of energy between the electrons and the lattice of the material.   During the hydrodynamic stage when material removal begins, the electron and lattice temperatures  are approximately the same [48].  The expanding cloud, also known as the plume, has a very thin shell of  ejected matter on its external edge.  Gasliquid phase material fills the shell, and the density of this  material phase decreases as the plume expands proportionally to the time of expansion.

Laser Parameters for Propulsion 

Laser propulsion requires high intensity laser pulses for propellant ablation.  Lasermatter interactions  differ greatly with different materials.  For example, transparent materials transport light at low  intensities, but absorb and heat very quickly at high intensities [33].  This explains why a laser can be  directed and focused through a series of lenses at a wider beam diameter, however at the focal point  the intensity greatly increases and has a higher potential for ablation.  In order to get high intensity pulses either a high power laser must be used, or a shorter pulse width can  be used with a lower power laser, possibly to decrease the size, weight, and cost of the laser.  The  average power of a laser is defined by Equation (3.1) below given in Joules per second, or Watts [W].   
 

 

 

(3.1) 

Then using the average power, the energy per pulse can be calculated.  The energy per pulse is an  important value as it directly influences the intensity of the laser, shown in Equation (3.2) defined as  joules of energy per pulse [J]. 
 

 

(3.2) 

The repetition rate is the frequency that the laser releases a pulse.  The fluence of the laser is defined as  the energy per cross sectional area of the laser at its focal point, or spot [J/cm2].  
 

 

(3.3) 

A useful method to increase laser beam power is to reduce the spot size, which is done with lenses.   Spot size (diameter), 
 

, of the focused beam can be calculated using Equation (3.4) [51].  1.27  

(3.4) 

Where   is the focal length of the focusing lens used,   is the wavelength of the laser light, and D is the  diameter of the incident collimated beam.    Equation (3.5) shows how laser intensity is inversely proportional to the pulse width, defined as Watts  per cross sectional area of the spot [W/cm2]. 

23   

 

 

(3.5) 

The pulse width is the length of the laser pulse given in seconds.  Another important parameter for laser  ablation is the peak power of the pulse.  Where the energy per pulse may be low due to the repetition  rate, Equation (3.6) shows how the pulse width can significantly increase the peak power of the laser  pulse.  For thrust purposes, peak power is an important parameter due to the material dissipating heat  with time.  In order to blast material from the zone, a high intensity short pulse is desired to reduce the  amount of time available for heat conduction.  
 

 

(3.6) 

With a high peak power from a short pulse width, lower power lasers can be used for propulsion.  This  opens the field to diode lasers which are much lower power lasers compared to large tabletop lasers.  

3.2

Fluence 

Ejected materials by the ablation are strongly influenced by laser energy density [52].  Energy density is  also known as fluence, with units typically [J/cm2].  Laser fluence is not uniformly distributed over the  focal spot diameter, and its typical distribution is given below in Equation (3.7) [48].

(3.7) 

Where   is the surface energy density of the absorbed laser [J/cm2], r is the distance from the center of  the laser spot perpendicular to the laser beam, and   is the spot diameter from Equation (3.4).   

This non uniform fluence distribution is described below in Figure 31 with a Gaussian beam profile.

Where the z axis is the centerline of the beam, R(z) is the radius of curvature of the wave surface, D is  the radius of the collimated beam, and w0 is the minimum diameter of the beam being focused by the  lens on the right.  Along z is the depth of focus (DOF), defined by Equation (3.8).   
 

2 2.5

  (3.8)   

The DOF is the distance that the beam can be considered focused.  The exact focal point is at the  minimum diameter w0, but determined by the wavelength we can assume the beam to be focused at  any point within the DOF.  The DOF is centered at the focal point and extends 0.5*DOF in both directions  along z.  Figure 32 below describes the intensity in a Gaussian beam, where the highest intensity is at the center  of the beam spot.  [30]. 

 
Figure 32: Intensity of Gaussian Beam Across Beam Diameter [30] 

The fluence threshold (FTh ) of the material must be reached in order for ablation to occur.  The fluence  threshold basically describes how much energy can be absorbed by the material before it begins to  ablate, or the minimum amount of fluence required to ablate the material [48].  The ablation process is most simply described by Equation (3.9): ablation rate per pulse [53].

3.3

Plasma Plume Expansion 

As energy is focused into the ejected material with high intensity, it breaks down into a ball of expanding  plasma [5].  Plasma expansion is a topic of great depth.  Groups have researched the effects of plasma  expansion on thrust in many different scenarios.  Schall et al. suggested using a nozzle to further  contribute to thrust generation by using the high pressure expanding gas [5].  The effects of plasma  expansion are heavily dependent on laser type, material, atmospheric conditions etc.  Ambient air  density influences surface pressure during ablation and plume generation [54][50].  However, the initial  expansion of the plume is not affected much since the large 1kbar driving pressure is typically much  higher than ambient pressure [50].    Horisawa & Kimura found that the moment coupling coefficient (Cm) decreased as incident pulse fluence  levels increased [16].  Eckel et al supported this theory by finding that the amount of energy that isn't  absorbed by the plasma is inversely proportional to the pulse energy [55].  This implies that the amount  of energy that actually reaches the target material is a greater percentage of the incident pulse energy  when the pulse energy is lower.  Plasma further influences the pulse reaching the material depending on  the length of the pulse.  Since plasma growth times are very short, about 1 to 2.5s, a shorter pulse  should be used to reduce plasma and pulse interaction time [56].  Plasma lifetimes are also only several  microseconds long [18].  Eckel et al also found that pulse lengths shorter than the plasma build up time  of approximately 1s should be used to reduce the amount of energy lost to plasma plume absorption  [55].  This is due to a breakdown of the material or air in front of the target which feeds the plasma  expansion away from the surface [55].  There is thus a loss of energy deposition and as a result a loss of  impulse potential from the interaction.    The combustion effects from testing in air as opposed to in a vacuum do not drastically contribute to  thrust production.  Sterling et al. found an increase of about 12% when testing in air vs. testing in 1atm  of nitrogen [57].  A plasma plume example is given below in Figure 33 [18]. 

26   

 
Figure 33: Actual plasma plume from lead sample [18] 

Eckel et al found that an increase in pulse energy did not linearly increase plasma wave front velocities  [55].  Several groups have investigated the effects of constricting the plasma expansion with a thicker  medium to increase thrust.  Zheng et al used both a glass plate and water in different tests to determine  Cm value increases [58].  They found an increase in the Cm value by 30 times vs. a conventional direct  ablation method in atmospheric conditions.  Energy conversion from the plasma expansion to kinetic  energy in the water is converted much more than in air.  The plasma expansion confinement increased  the absorption efficiency of the laser pulse, which is a similar result to using a high absorption propellant  [58].  Their experiments also found that thicker layers of water produced higher Cm values.     

3.4

Modes of Laser Ablation Plume Generation 

There are two methods to generate thrust via laser ablation of the material.  Reflective mode(Rmode) is  when the laser pulse on the material causes the plume to expand back towards the laser.  Transmission  mode, or Tmode, involves ablating the thickness of the material with a single pulse so that the plume  expands from the back of the material.  The following figures describe both reflection (Figure 34) and  transmission mode (Figure 35) ablation.         

27   

  Laser       

Plume

Figure 34: Reflective Mode Ablation

The Rmode has several drawbacks, the primary one being that material deposits often end up on the  laser lens if the laser is in close proximity to the material.  Another obvious drawback is wasted material.   As the material is ablated, there is unablated material left over that will not be able to provide the same  ablation energy as the previous pulse due to the crater that remains.  This material could be made  thinner so as to have the laser ablate the thickness in one single pulse and reduce material waste.      Laser          
Plume Figure 35: Transmission Mode Ablation

Propellant

The thickness of the material required to completely ablate and achieve transmission mode is  dependent on the laser characteristics.  Laser power, frequency, and wavelength all contribute to the  ability of the laser to ablate.  Different materials will also exhibit different performances with different  lasers.  For the testing conducted in this research reflective mode was mainly used as the lenses were  considerably far away from the ablation zone, and pulse energies are too low to effectively ablate the  materials used with a single pulse.  Using reflective mode did not hinder any experimental data, and  several observations were made based on reflective mode ablation specifically.  A test was designed to  incorporate transmission mode, however it was unclear as to whether or not transmission mode  actually occurred. 

28   

3.5

Propellants Used for Laser Driven Micropropulsion 

Propellants that are best for laser micropropulsion have several main requirements, one being that they  should not continue to burn after the laser has stopped firing.  This would mostly waste propellant.  The  propellant can also not contaminate the body it's propelling with ablation byproducts.  If contaminants  get onto the lenses or sit in a nozzle, they can greatly hinder the performance of the micropropulsion  system, if it's able to function any further at all [5].      Polymers are often chosen for applications where thrust is desired.  Metals have very high heat  conductivity when compared to polymers.  For low power lasers, the likelihood for ablation increases  when materials with high light absorption in the laser wavelength are chosen.      Diode lasers, which are typically used for micro propulsion, are also usually unable to reach ablation  thresholds for metals unless they are used as a pumping source for other lasers, for example a diode  laser pumping an NdYAG laser [40].  The wavelengths (920980[nm]) and pulse durations (100[s]) for  diode lasers limit them to using polymers for ablation.  Metals do not eject much mass when ablated,  again when compared to polymers for low power lasers, thus it is not very good for thrust production  with low power lasers [5].  However, the low thrust production levels of metals and low material  removal amounts compared to polymers per laser pulse increase the specific impulse values of most  metals.     Polymers generally undergo incubation--the fluence threshold reduces as the material is pulsed with  the laser [59].  This means that initially the fluence threshold may be high, but after a number of pulses  it will decrease fairly rapidly.  Incubation generally occurs at wavelengths where the absorption  coefficient of the polymer is low [60].  One investigation showed that the ablation of several different polymers melted and generated volatile  substances.  These polymers are polycarbonate (PC), polyethylenterephthalate (PET),  polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).  Polyimide (PI) was the last test  material, which tended to degrade and/or sublimate [59].  All of the materials tested induced cavities  smaller than the quasiGaussian focal diameter on the surface.  The ablation rates were less than 1m  within the first 50 pulses, which was typically due to incubation [59].   

29   

Ablation of polymers is both a photochemical and photothermal reaction, with the ratio of the two  depending on the polymer blend and the irradiation wavelength.  For thrust generation, the  photochemical properties are not very important [53].  Thrust generation requires exothermic  decomposition, gas formation, and a well defined decomposition temperature.  Transformation of laser  energy to thrust for energetic polymers is typically greater than 100%, implying that 100% of the energy  focused on the material is converted into thrust [53].   

3.6

Doping Agents 

Doping agents are added to materials to assist with absorption of light at wavelengths where the  material's absorption coefficient is low.  Polymers are generally able to be ablated with less intensity  than metals, but doping the polymer compound can increase its ability to produce thrust.  Generally no  more than approximately 10% dopant should be added to the material [53].  Most polymers are unable  to absorb infrared radiation unless doped.  These dopants could be carbon, or IR dyes.  Carbon  nanopearls produce the best results from various thrust experiments [53].    Glycidel Azide Polymer (GAP) was originally developed as a binder for solid rocket propellant as it's a  high energetic polymer.  When GAP is doped with an IR dye it typically transforms almost all of the  material ablated to a gaseous form, thus being good for generating thrust.  When GAP is doped with  carbon, many craters are formed and material is ejected without creating much gaseous product, which  is not very good for generating thrust [53].  Generally, IR dyes lead to more homogeneous  decomposition, which aids in transforming ablated material to gaseous form and generates more thrust  than if other dopants were used.  For example, large material fragments are ejected from some  materials doped with carbon.  PVC+C (poly vinyl chloride doped with carbon) and PVN+C (poly vinyl  nitrate) are two examples where large material fragments are ejected upon ablation [53].    Lippert & Urech found that the plume expansion velocity of the explosion from ablation was low for PVC  while for GAP and PVN it was fairly high [53].  The amount of chemically stored energy is proportional to  the expansion velocity, implying that a high expansion velocity has more energy available for thrust [53].   Eckel et al found that doped materials tested had much higher exhaust velocities than the undoped  materials; 2.5km/s vs. 8km/s when doped [55]. 

3.7

Basic Principles of Thrust Production 

For thrust production, a high transition rate from solid state to gaseous state is desired [53].  Ablation is  caused by radiating a large amount of energy into a spot on the material in a very short period of time.   30   

The energized material then transitions from solid to gaseous form and exerts an impulse on the body  [5].  The ejection of gas from the surface forms a cloud of plasma particles, which consists of ground  state neutrons, electrons, and ions [49].  The mass and exhaust velocity of the ablated material are the  main contributors to the production of thrust.  Mass, as defined in these equations, is the amount of  material ablated per pulse.  Below in Equation (3.10) is a commonly used rocket thrust equation [6]. 
 

 

(3.10) 

Where   is the mass flow rate of the propellant, and 

 is the effective exhaust velocity of the 

propellant.  The effective exhaust velocity is commonly used to describe a uniform, axial, and averaged  exhaust velocity of the ejected propellant.  Since multiple pulse ablation is used for thrust generation in  this work, the approximated average velocity of a single pulse is used for calculation.  The product of the  mass flow rate and velocity is related to Newton's second law, shown in Equation (3.11). 
 

      (3.11) 

Since exhaust velocity is considered constant, the change in velocity over time is zero.  The change in  mass is the mass removed from the sample via laser ablation, hence mass flow rate,  .  In this equation,  T is the thrust generated, and   is the effective exhaust velocity of the ablated material.   

By integrating force, or thrust, over the time interval the force is applied, one can find the Impulse of the  action, described by Equation (3.12). 
 

       (3.12) 

This shows how Impulse,  , is defined as the change in momentum.  The product of mass and velocity is  known as momentum, P, typically given in Ns.  The relation is described below in Equation (3.13).   

31   

 

   

  (3.13) 

Where m is the mass ablated per pulse and 

 is the effective exhaust velocity over the time interval 

used to measure thrust.  The use of impulse to calculate exhaust velocity is used in these experiments  with the assumption that the initial velocity is zero as the propellant starts from rest.    The moment coupling coefficient is often used to evaluate micropropulsion systems, described with  Equation (3.14) as the thrust to power ratio [61].  
 

  (3.14)   

Moment coupling coefficient, Cm, often in units of Ns/J or N/W, is a very useful term when comparing  data from one test to another as it takes the energy in each pulse into consideration.  The term however  does not account for the many other parameters that influence thrust output from laser ablation such  as pulse width.    By using the moment coupling coefficient, thrust can also be calculated using Equation (3.15) [5]. 
 

 

(3.15) 

Where   is the frequency of the laser and E is the laser pulse energy.  This equation suggests that thrust  is directly proportional to the repetition rate of the laser.  However, use of this equation also suggests  that the force on the body is present for the duration of time defined by the repetition rate.  This  method was used for initial calculations and determined to be incorrect for the system used in these  tests.  Thrust generated for a time of 1.5s was used to calculate impulse in these tests as suggested by  Pakhomov et al.[18].  Thrust is often determined experimentally, and then other parameters are  calculated via these equations by using the ablated mass, thrust generated, and time interval.    Every material will react differently with different wavelength lasers.  This will ultimately determine the  amount of energy that the material absorbs from the laser, and thus determines the thrust potential for  the material [3].  The amount of energy required to ablate a material can be calculated using Equation  (3.16) [4]. 

32   

 



 

(3.16) 

Where E denotes the amount of optical power per pulse provided by the laser in Joules, and   m is the  mass of the material ablated.  Using this value with the coefficient of momentum Cm from Equation  (3.14), Equation (3.17) can be formulated for exhaust velocity [62]. 
 

 

(3.17) 

With high powered lasers, metals can prove very effective for thrust production as they are very easily  capable of surpassing fluence thresholds.  Metals also typically have high exhaust velocities, which  would directly affect thrust produced [5].  Specific impulse as defined in Equation (3.18) as the ratio of  thrust per unit weight of material used and is very useful when comparing propulsion systems.   
 

1 1

    (3.18)     

Weight, W, in Equation (3.18) is defined as the product of mass and gravity.  The mass term drops out  and another equation to define specific impulse remains as the time averaged exhaust velocity divided  by gravity at sea level.  A term used to describe the ablation efficiency is given in Equation (3.19) [5]. 
 

2 Where 

 

(3.19) 

 is the ablation efficiency and E is the laser pulse energy.  The laser ablation efficiency is 

simply the kinetic energy of the exhaust divided by the laser pulse energy.  It can also be described with  Equation (3.20) where an arrangement of terms shown can provide another relation [4].     

33   

 

2 2 2

      (3.20) 

This shows that the relation to the ablation efficiency is directly related to the exhaust velocity and the  moment coupling coefficient.  It's interesting to note that for very high values of Cm it is likely that the  exhaust velocity, and in turn the specific impulse value, will be low due to the ablation efficiency  threshold of 100%.  

34   

Chapter 4: Test Apparatus Development 
Ready apparatus' for testing micro thrust are nonexistent, and any method for testing must be  designed at the facility.  As a result, test apparatus development was required early in this thesis before  any testing had ever been conducted.  Also, as such testing has never been conducted at these facilities  it was required to fully investigate and develop all methods from scratch.   

4.1

Testing Method Development 

The apparatus had several different initial concepts that were derived from published methods.  The  original methods and final setup are discussed in this section.  4.1.1 Torque Sensor 

The initial design method was to have a rod attached to a torque sensor, pivoting on bearings.  On the  rod would be a sample holder to which the laser would be directed for ablation.  The ablation would  cause a deflection, and in turn torsion of the rod.  The holder was designed to be adjustable to create a  larger moment arm.  The design is described below in Figure 41. 

Torque  Sensor 

Sample Holder 

 
Figure 41: Torque Sensor Design 

The issue with this design is the torque sensor sensitivity, and adequate bearings that would not  essentially drown the micro forces from the ablation.  The sensor would also require a series of  components (amplifier, controller etc) that were too costly to purchase without a guarantee that it 

35   

would work.  A vacuum chamber is believed to aid in the acquisition of micro thrust data and was  originally part of this design, similar to published methods.  As a vacuum chamber was not available, on  top of the other complications, this design was discarded.  4.1.2 High Speed Camera 

A high speed ICCD camera was also investigated in order to capture exhaust velocities and solve for the  thrust developed.  As time of flight (TOF) measurements do not work well in atmospheric pressure since  ambient pressure restricts plume expansion [35], and the equipment is very costly, this method was  quickly discarded.    Plume expansion restriction is also the reason that another method was discarded, where the ejected  material would push on a pendulum.  4.1.3 Direct Force Sensor 

This method would employ a direct force sensor: PCB Piezotronics model 209C01, capable of 100kHz  resolution.  It was originally believed that 100kHz was too slow which was an initial downside to this  method.  This sensor is also very costly itself, in addition to the cost of the amplifier and the controller.   The sensor is believed to be accurate and has been used by Pakhomov et al. in several instances,  however a proper setup to utilize this sensor without damaging it was a concern, as testing for both  reflective and transmission mode was desired.  It was also desired to look into other methods for higher  resolution, so this method was discarded.  4.1.4 Piezoelectric Sensor 

After finding the direct force sensor from PCB Piezotronics (Depew,New York), and deciding that a direct  force measurement system would be best for these facilities, another method for testing using  piezoelectric materials was designed.  This method used piezoelectric films from Measurement  Specialties, Inc. (MSI) made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).  When a force is applied to the film, the  film displaces in one or more of its axes and outputs a voltage relative to the displacement.  The sensors  are very sensitive and, if used in the proper mode, have a very high resolution in the MHz range.  As the  films are very susceptible to being burned by the laser, a method of force transfer was designed.   Initially, the system was set up to have a pendulum hold the sample, and have the pendulum impact the  sensor.  The sensor has a very high resolution when plane 12 is laid flat against a surface and is  impacted along Axis 3, described in Figure 42 where a film and its axes are shown.  Axis 1 is the axis on  which the attached electrical leads are parallel to.   36

The design was kept simple so that it could be manufactured by the writer with the facilities at the  university.  The propellant would be attached with an adhesive to the visible face of the sample holder,  which was to be suspended by thin wire from the top slide where vertical adjustments of the sample  holder can be made.  The table mount could be attached to the table, and served as a horizontal  adjustment method for the sample.  The horizontal and vertical adjustment methods were added since  the laser level and placement is set for these tests.    The sample holder conically comes to a point on the opposite side, and is in contact with the PVDF on  the holder.  The PVDF holder, as shown in Figure 44, slides out of the stand in order to change the  sensor or insert a different slide with a different profile, described below.   

Handle to  Remove Slide 

PVDF  Placement  Step for Wire  Clearance   
Figure 44: PVDF Slide 1 

The step in the center of PVDF Slide 1 allows for wires to be run without bending the film and putting  stress on the adhesion.  The PVDF was connected via a twisted shielded cable to an amplifier that was  designed for these tests, described later in this chapter.  This system was believed to have been able to  work, except the forces are so low that the sensor is unable to pick up the signal when applied in this  fashion.  The voltage to force conversion when the force is applied for film compression on the 12 plane  is very low, approximately 13E3V/N [63].  The PVDF film is much more sensitive in its other modes;  however the response is much slower.  The tradeoff between response and sensitivity was easy to  debate since the signal was regularly nonexistent in the compression mode.  The slide was redesigned  to allow for bending in the film, shown below in Figure 45.    38   

PVDF Attached with  an Adhesive to  these Surfaces   
Figure 45: PVDF Slide 2 

Bending was a relatively simple method to choose from the initial as it required very little machining of  the test apparatus.  The samples were tested again and results were recorded.  The issue with this  method is that the data is inconsistent, which lead to the assumption that the sample holder is also  providing error to the data.  The sample holder is a mass that the force must provide momentum to in  order to then displace the PVDF film.  Since this is not a perfect system there are losses with each  transfer of momentum, also with contributions to the minimal but existent air resistance.  The other  potential issue is that the sample holder twists when a force is applied, implying that the force is not  being directly transferred to the PVDF film as intended.  Due to the complications with this design, another final design was tested using the same concept of  directly sampling the force using a PVDF film.  This new method is described in the next section.  4.1.5 Cantilevered Piezoelectric Sensor 

Building on the bending mode of the PVDF film, a new method was developed for testing thrust  production via laser ablation.  This method removes the sample holder and allows the laser to ablate a  propellant which is directly attached to the sensor.  The test apparatus is designed to exclude the sensor  from the ablation area itself in order to minimize any contribution from the ejected material on the  sensor directly.   

39   

This setup provided a well distinguishable signal and was further developed to reduce noise, and isolate  the force produced.  Data acquisition is achieved by shooting the laser at the propellant attached to the  sensor, as shown in Figure 46.              Laser 
Figure 46: Propellant Attached to PVDF Sensor

Propellant  PVDF Sensor Electrical Leads 

The propellant is attached using Loctite 495 as it was found to keep the PVDF film lamination  undamaged upon propellant removal.  An example of lamination damage is shown below in Figure 47.   

 
Figure 47: Lamination Damage 

The bottom rectangular object is a sample that was glued to the PVDF film.  A silver substance can be  seen on the sample, which is PVDF that went with the sample when they were separated.  The Loctite  495 seemed to reduce the damage to the sensor and was recommended by MSI.  In order to further  protect the sensor, the propellant is attached at the tip of the PVDF film on the lamination instead of on 

40   

the PVDF directly; as was described in Figure 46.  This also protects the sensor from the laser beam  once the material has depleted at the laser spot.  PVDF films were also initially chosen due to their very  low cost, and in the event that a sensor was damaged it could easily be replaced.  Using this method  very few sensors were used and virtually none were damaged unintentionally.  Several of the sensors  were damaged intentionally by the beam to observe the effects of the resulting sensitivity.  It was  observed that the sensor generally was unusable once the laser ablated the surface.  This is not  necessarily due to the fact that it was punctured but could be due to the overheating of the element, or  the fusion of the two layers shorting the sensor.  The sensors can accept temperatures in the range of  40oC to approximately 100oC [63], so the very high temperatures encountered from a direct ablation  would definitely destroy the sensor.  Often once the sensor is ablated it was observed to no longer  output a signal at all.    This setup illustrated in Figure 48, allowed the PVDF to deflect freely from its base.  The mounting holds  the sensor steady as to not induce an erroneous signal, and the wires connected to the leads are twisted  and shielded with an aluminum foil to protect from electromagnetic interference (EMI).

The leads attached to the PVDF film are both attached to a different layer on the film where the  potential is generated.  For bending, both layers are off of the neutral axis.  As the sensor bends, the  neutral axis acts as a pivot for the layers and enhances the compression of the layers as a result;  described in Figure 410 below.

4.1.5.1 PVDF Film Sensor Issues  There is no data available for the response of the PVDF film in a cantilevered arrangement.  This became  an issue as calibrating for such small interrupted forces, as those generated from a highly repetitive  pulsed laser, is very difficult.  Calibration methods are explained later in this chapter under Calibration.   Due to the calibration difficulties, the option to attach the film to a thin surface and attempt to have the  thrust stretch the PVDF in the 1 axis arose.  This method would be satisfactory for larger forces, but the  thrust generated is believed to be too small to be able to deflect such a surface.  The MSI technical  manual [63] mentions that the sensitivity of the sensor is heightened when used in bending, however to  an unknown degree.  There is data available for the compression and tension modes, which is why those  modes were experimented with initially.  Shooting the propellant at different positions is assumed to provide different results due to the  operation of the PVDF responding to a displacement with a voltage.  As a result, the effect of the  distance to the voltage change will be investigated as well.  For these experiments, all samples were  ablated at the same distance from the PVDF sensor while keeping a safe distance to minimize pyro electric effects.  The pyroelectric effects are low frequency [63] and are assumed to be filtered out by  the amplifier and post process filtering.  Typically only a very rapid change in temperature would be  noticed [63], however, any pyroelectric effects are still best avoided during testing. 

4.2

Piezoelectric Sensors 

The pyroelectric phenomenon was discovered by Gaugain in 1856.  He made precise measurements of  the pyroelectric charges using a self discharging electroscope.  In 1878 Lord Kelvin then associated the  electric field with the pyroelectric effect [64].   Piezoelectricity, translates from the Greek language as  pressure electricity [65][66], was then discovered by the Curie brothers in 1880 [67].  They noticed  electric polarization occurred when a crystal was compressed along its hemihedral axis [67].  The crystal  produces equal and opposite electrical quantities, and the quantity developed by a temperature or  pressure increase is equal and opposite to that for an equal decrease in pressure or temperature.  This  implies that the piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses are completely reversible [66].  The electric  charge, however, decays with time so these sensors are not good for static measurement [65].  Piezoelectricity provides great capability for small force sensors.  The difficulty with using piezoelectric  materials for sensors is proper calibration and filtered amplification.  For these experiments, Mylar  laminated PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) films (LDTK0028K) were used instead of ceramics due to their 

44   

higher sensitivity.  The LDTK0028K has a thickness of 28m unlaminated, with a 127m Mylar  laminate.    PVDF piezoelectric films are able to output 10 times the voltage of piezo ceramics with the same force  applied.  The PVDF films also have a wide frequency range of 0.001Hz to 109Hz, making them highly  susceptible to pressure waves and any thermal changes on the film surface [63].  Good shielding is  required for use in these applications as the leads are highly susceptible to electromagnetic  interference.  For these tests, the wires attached to the leads are twisted to dampen major incoming  differential signals due to EMI.  The wires are then wrapped in aluminum foil and sheathed with a  rubber sleeve.  At the leads, the wires are quickly spot soldered as to not overheat the sensor but to  allow the wires a clean connection.  The leads are then taped and wrapped with aluminum as well to  reduce any EMI.  Using these sheathing methods and proper grounding significantly reduced the amount  of noise in the signal.  For mechanical to electrical conversion using the PVDF film, values of 14.4V/N applied can be output at  the leads if used in axial tension axis (along axis 1) [63].  Adhesion of the film to a substrate is required,  and attempting to deflect the substrate with the expected micro Newton forces was expected to  provide very poor results.  As a comparison, a complete 3 direction compression would only output 13E 3V/N of force applied [63].  Tests were initially conducted with compressive forces on our apparatus and  were very difficult to distinguish if visible on the oscilloscope at all.  As was described in the previous  section, another method of testing was developed where the film acted in a cantilever configuration.   The difficulty with this configuration is that there is very little data available for the PVDF in a  cantilevered configuration.  Typically this configuration is used for lower frequency applications such as  counting, or switches.  Early in the experiments, we were unsure as to which method of data analysis  should be used.  It was decided to experiment with the cantilevered configuration and assume that the  thrust generated is low enough to allow the PVDF film to sense a majority of the pulses with our high  repetition rate laser.  A SolidWorks simulation was performed to estimate the deflection of the film with  a 100N force applied at the center of the sample; Figure 413. 

45   

 
Figure 413: Deflected PVDF Film 

  The film's displacement from a 100N force is approximately 6.5m, implying that the film will not have  displaced a great amount before the next pulse is ablating the propellant.  This is also coupled with the  natural dampening of the sensor, leading us to assume that the addition of displacement from each  sequential pulse is relatively null.  As this thesis was not focused on FEM analysis of the sensor during  the ablation process, it should be noted that the simulation generated for this section is solely for  assumption verification. 

4.3

Signal Processing 

Piezoelectric films are very susceptible to noise, and require extensive filtering and signal processing.   For these experiments, the analog signals received from the piezoelectric film are amplified and sent to  a digital oscilloscope as an analog signal.  The signal is then placed into a developed MATLAB code that  converted and filtered the signals using Simulink.  MATLAB code and Simulink filter setup are given in  Appendix A: MATLAB Code and Simulink Filters.  4.3.1 Amplifier Development 

The thrust produced by laser ablation is miniscule compared to the minimum threshold for traditional  static or dynamic force sensors.  The piezoelectric film required amplification to be able to measure the  thrust generated.  As the signal is also very noisy, an amplifier and filter were required to be developed.   Several different options were reviewed and some were assembled onto a breadboard for signal testing.  

46   

One circuit design by Vargas et al. claimed to be able to drive a PVDF film up to 500kHz [68].  The circuit  was assembled onto a breadboard, as shown in Figure 414.  The circuit did not seem to perform as  intended, so this amplifier configuration was discarded. 

 
Figure 414: Vargas et al. Circuit on a Breadboard 

Another amplifier arrangement was developed using Filter Pro 2.0,  freely available from Texas  Instruments.  The developed signal conditioning circuit was converted to a schematic and the board sent  out for manufacturing.   The electronics were then assembled onto the PCB pictured in Figure 415.  The  circuit schematic is in Appendix B: Amplifier Schematics.  

 
Figure 415: Signal Conditioning Unit 

The signal conditioning unit was designed to preamplify the signal, filter it, and then amplify it again  before the signal was sent to a digital oscilloscope.  The total gain of the amplifier circuit was 1000 or  47   

60dB.  The filter that was used was a Butterworth bandpass type with cutoff frequencies of 1kHz and  600kHz.  The Butterworth type was chosen as its response is flat in the passband.  The preamplifier  stage used an instrumentation operational amplifier due to its high input impedance and easy gain  selection through a single resistor.  The signal conditioner was tuned and the performance verified using  a signal generator [Tektronix AFG 3022B] and oscilloscope [LeCroy Wavesurfer 422] over the frequency  range of 1Hz to 1MHz; amplifier frequency response graph shown in Figure 416.

The frequency response shows that the repetition rate range used for these tests (10kHz40kHz) are  fully amplified.   

4.4

Calibration 

Since no data was available for the LDTK028K with respect to low displacement vs. voltage or force vs.  voltage, a method for calibration was required.  By dropping a very small mass onto the tip of the sensor  (in the same fashion as our propulsion occurs), a ratio of calculated force to tested voltage was  determined to be 42.35V/N.  This value is an approximation of the relation as a dropped mass and a  repetitive force induced from the laser are very different.  The relation is assumed to be a good  approximation as the sensitivity was expected to be higher than in the axial tension mode of 14.4V/N.     

48   

This was validated using various masses and vertical distances, all samples start from rest on a platform  using solely the acceleration of gravity to provide velocity.  Impact force can be calculated using  Equation (3.12) for Impulse; rearranged in Equation (4.1). 
 

    

      (4.1) 

Where 

 represents the amount of force applied to the surface of the piezoelectric film,   is the   is the 

amount of time that mass is in contact with the surface, m is the mass of the object, and 

velocity of the mass at impact, defined by Equation (4.2) below, derived from the equation for work.   The time of the impact was estimated to be 0.001 seconds, and was roughly verified with a high speed  camera.  The high speed camera captured 1000 frames per second and it was verified that the mass was  in contact for just a single frame.  The error with this assumption is that the impact time could have in  fact been faster, but since there is no method for accurate validation available, the slowest time that  was attainable from the images was used.  Force in the equations below is defined as mass multiplied by  gravitational acceleration of the object, F=ma.

Where h is the distance that the mass falls,   is the final velocity, and   is initial velocity which has  been set to zero as the mass starts from rest in these experiments.  Using Equation (4.2), commonly  known as the kinetic energy, an energy balance can be used; shown in Equation (4.3) below, commonly  known as the gravitational potential energy. 

49   

 

     (4.3) 

Equating Equation (4.2) to Equation (4.3), the final velocity of the mass just before impact can be  calculated and is shown in Equation (4.4).

 Where g is the gravitational acceleration, and   describes the final velocity of the mass just before  impact ( ).  With these equations, it was assumed that the effects of air drag and rotation of the 

falling mass are negligible to the magnitude of the impact force.    The calibration data should be taken as an approximation of the force to voltage output as the force is  very small and could be affected by the amplifier and connecting cables.  The signals gathered for the  single dropped mass and the highly repetitive pulse forces of the laser ablation are fairly different, which  further indicates that this calibration method is not precise.  An example of a sinusoidal signal from  calibration is given in Figure 417. 

 
Figure 417: Signal from Dropped Mass 

Another example given below in Figure 418 shows the sensor picking up the mass bouncing several  times after impact.  50   

 
Figure 418: Bouncing Calibration Mass 

The data is run through the generated MATLAB code and Simulink filter setup, given in Appendix A:  MATLAB Code and Simulink Filters.  The absolute maximum value of the filtered signal voltage was  divided by the calculated force from Equation (4.1) to create a force to voltage ratio (V/N).  The various  masses were all used to create an average ratio.  The ratio is used to convert all test data from a voltage  signal to a force vs. time graph.

Summary 

A test setup was developed to evaluate the effects of using a high repetition rate nanosecond laser for  laser ablation propulsion.  The test setup includes an amplifier system designed specifically for the  piezoelectric film used in these tests.  The laser was fired repetitively at the same spot to study the  effects of using a lower energy repetitive pulse laser for thrust production.   Moment coupling  coefficient Cm, and specific impulse Isp values were evaluated as well as the effects of the laser  parameters on the propellant.

Chapter 5: Nanosecond Laser Micropropulsion 
5.1 Test Setup 

The testing apparatus is setup as shown below in Figure 51.  Tests were conducted in an isolated room  maintained at 20oC at 30% humidity, on an optics table to isolate the testing area from ambient  vibrations.   

 
Figure 51: Apparatus Layout 

The laser source was a commercially available Qswitched diode pumped solid state (DPSS) Nd:YAG  industrial laser delivering 10W of 1064nm light at 10kHz to 40kHz.  The light is passed through a second  harmonic generator which outputs two wavelengths of light at 1064nm and 532nm.  This is called the  dual wavelength effect, which effectively increases the absorption of the laser light.  For materials that  have high absorption efficiencies around 532nm, this is very beneficial.  The material first absorbs the  532nm light and changes the absorption coefficient due to an increased electron density distribution.   This change enables the 1064nm wavelength to be absorbed more efficiently.  Excited electron density  and plasma plume density was found to be higher for dual wavelength pulses than for single by  Sivakumar et al. [69].  The laser light ablates the propellant attached to the sample, which is then deflected.  The signal is  received by the amplifier, where the signal is filtered for 1kHz to 600kHz and amplified by 1000x.  The  amplifier outputs the signal to the oscilloscope [LeCroy Wavesurfer 422], which is captured and analyzed  using MATLAB on a PC.  An image of the testing facility is given below in Figure 52.

5.2

Propellants 

For initial testing of the system, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was chosen as a propellant due to the  resources available regarding its behavior during laser ablation.  As testing continued other materials  were tested to evaluate the effects of high repetition rate materials for use as  propellant.  Metals were  added to the testing as well since they were found in other tests to have high exhaust velocities  resulting in high specific impulse values relative to polymers.  A list of materials used is given below in  Table 51. 
Material  Thickness [in]  Colour  Thermal  Conductivity  [W/mK]  Aluminum  0.005  Blue   250  Aluminum 0.005 Natural 250  PVC 0.065 Dark Grey 0.19  PVC 0.0045 White 0.19  Brass  0.005  Natural  109  Brass 0.001 Natural 109 

Table 51: Materials Used for Testing 

53   

The colour of the material is given as the coloured aluminum was found to produce higher thrust results  than the natural aluminum colour.  The blue coating is believed to be a thin coat of paint used by the  distributor to differentiate the material thicknesses.  The aluminum samples are both of the same alloy.   The thermal conductivity is given as a comparison for the materials used [70].  The material ablated per  pulse is expected to be a reflection of the thermal conductivity.  The mass ablated per pulse for PVC is  expected to be the highest of the three materials due to the polymer having a low melting temperature  of approximately 100oC compared to the metals being around 900oC.  This will also strongly contribute  to the heat affected zone of the PVC being larger than the other materials.  The samples were all attached to the sensor with an adhesive so that the overlap was on the lamination  of the sensor and not on the actual PVDF.  This was to reduce the chance of pyroelectric effects and to  reduce the chances of delamination when the sample was removed from the sensor.  The samples were  examined to ensure that the bond between the propellant and the sensor was strong enough to be  considered rigid for these tests.  The adhesive joint is expected to reduce the transferred thrust by a  very small amount, assumed to be consistent over all tests and negligible.  The propellants were all  ablated in the same fashion and same patterning to maintain consistency between results.  The effects  of ablating the material at different distances from the tip of the sensor were examined for the 0.005"  blue aluminum.   A 15% reduction was noticed in the signal over a 0.2" distance.    Seeking thrust values, the thickness of the material was not expected to be an issue as the laser was  allowed to fully pierce the material during data recording.  For these tests it was assumed that the laser  ablation occurred in reflective mode due to the thickness and positioning of the material.   

5.3

Digital Filtering 

The signal output from the piezofilm was quite noisy due to atmospheric interference, amplifier noise,  etc.  In addition, and most importantly to understand is the signaltonoise ratio (SNR) was very low; the  voltage output from the sensor due to the small thrust produced was on the order of tens of microvolts.    Post process digital filtering of the signal was used to significantly reduce the ambient noise and extract  the voltage signal that described the interaction of the laser with the propellant.   Simulink and MATLAB  software was used to post process the data; given in Appendix A: MATLAB Code and Simulink Filters.    A filtering sequence was developed that allowed the thrust signal to be extracted from the raw voltage  data.  An example of an unfiltered signal to a filtered signal is shown below in Figure 53. 

54   

 
Figure 53: Unfiltered and Filtered Signals for Brass, 0.001", 121J at 10kHz 

The signal was filtered with two sequential Butterworth type filters.  The first filter is a high pass filter  with a cut off frequency of 8kHz, coupled to a notch type that cuts out frequencies between 45kHz and  200kHz.  The combination was used instead of a bandpass filter due to the plasma plume expansion  occurring over several microseconds.  By keeping the upper frequencies in the signal, the neutral signal  noise did not increase but the signal during ablation increased slightly.  The signal in Figure 53 shows  how the noise signal is reduced.  The filtering effects differ slightly over the range of materials and  parameters, which is unavoidable if any filtering is used.  The same signal using only a bandpass filter  between 8kHz and 20kHz is shown below in Figure 54 for comparison of the filtering methods.   

55   

 
Figure 54: Unfiltered on Filtered Signals for Brass, 0.001", 121J at 10kHz using bandpass filter 

The signal filtered through a bandpass filter for the frequency of the repetition rate shows a larger  decrease in the noise signal; however the amplitude of the ablation signal was also greatly affected.  The  relative difference in the ablation signals between Figure 53 and Figure 54 is minimal compared to the  original signal and as a result the high pass combined with the notch filter was used to extract the thrust  signal from the raw data.  

5.4

Results and Discussions 

The testing conducted aimed at comparing the effects that repetition rate and laser pulse energy have  on micropropulsion.  During testing, several other phenomena relating to ablation and laser material  interaction were observed and are discussed in this section.    The depth of focus for these tests was 1.04 [cm]; when considering the 1064nm wavelength.  As long as  the material was within this depth of focus, the focal point position would not contribute much more to  the data and power increase is relatively negligible.  The focal spot size (using Equation (3.4)) for these  tests is 84.45m at a focal length of 125mm, with a beam diameter of 2mm and wavelength of 1064nm.   Considering that the dual wavelength effect may have had an effect on the spot size, the spot size for  532nm was calculated as 42.23m.  The spot size effect on different materials is evaluated as well in the 

56   

Laser Material Interaction section of this Chapter.  The laser was focused using the visible 532nm  wavelength focal spot, which is expected to be within the depth of focus of the 1064nm wavelength.  To  focus the laser, an aluminum foil was used at 125mm and translated along the beam axis.  The foil was  observed for sparking in the depth of focus until a strong ablation spot was found.  The piezo film with  the attached sample was placed at this point and checked again for laser focus.  Maintaining consistency between tests was a priority.  Ablation locations for 10kHz, 20kHz, and 30kHz  were kept within the same zone of the samples.  Sample weight may have impacted sensor response.   Samples were kept to approximately 0.5" by 0.2".  The samples were ablated from top to bottom for  each repetition rate, separating each series horizontally by approximately 0.03".  The previously  mentioned compensation for distance of ablation from the sensor was not added to the results as the  actual separations are considered negligible for these discussions.  5.4.1 Laser Parameters Used for Testing 

The data used for the graphs in this chapter are averaged values of multiple tests at each pulse energy  and repetition rate.  Standard deviations for the data are given in Appendix C: Test Data Compilation.  Testing was conducted with constant laser parameters given below in Table 52.  
Repetition Rate  Pulse Energy Setting 1 J/pulse  Pulse Energy Setting 2 J/pulse  Pulse Energy Setting 3 J/pulse  10kHz 121  185 237 20kHz 120 180 237 30kHz  115  162  207 

Table 52: Laser Parameters for Tests 

It is interesting to note that the pulse energies are the same at 10kHz and 20kHz due to the average  power doubling as well as the repetition rate.  The effects would be expected to produce the same  results since the repetition rates are both greatly lower that would promote LSD, which would be near  1MHz.  Originally, the 10kHz repetition rate was expected to produce higher thrust values.  The effects  of the repetition rate may only affect the pulse energy and not the thrust production as a result.  5.4.2 Waveform Patterns 

Patterns in the waveforms were observed at the different repetition rates.  The zoomed in waveforms  were observed at 10kHz, 20kHz, and 30kHz, shown below in Figure 55, Figure 56, and Figure 57  respectively.  Enlarged images are given to demonstrate the timescale of the occurrences.    57

Figure 56: Brass 20kHz 238J 

58   

 
Figure 57: Brass 30kHz 207J 

At 10kHz multiple waveforms are present in the signal, which was assumed to be thrust and a  rebounding response of the piezoelectric film.  As was observed in the calibration waveform (Figure  417), in the system response to an impulse there is a small artifact before the peak, and then a gradual  signal dampening.  Naturally, the frequency of the impulses significantly changes this behavior,  however, at 10kHz it responds very similarly.  At 20kHz and 30kHz there are no similarities to the 10kHz  signal.  Between the 20kHz and 30kHz signal the similarity is a consistent wave with no evidence of an  overlapping waveform.  Each peak occurs exactly at the repetition rate for the 20kHz and 30kHz signal.   This suggests that the system is moving harmonically with the force produced via laser ablation for  20kHz and 30kHz.  The 10kHz signal also responded with the repetition rate, as each major peak is at the  0.0001s marker.  This occurrence was fairly common with the signals obtained.  5.4.3 Laser Power and Repetition Rate 

Pulse energy is believed to be the greatest contributor to laser propulsion.  The intensity of the laser  power can be greatly increased by reducing the spot size of the focal point, or increasing the pulse  energy.  A smaller focal point may not significantly increase thrust produced but may increase specific  impulse, since less mass with a higher velocity is expected from the ablation.  Pulse width has also been  shown to significantly change the ablation dynamics.  The pulse width for these tests was not changed.   In this section the maximum thrust for each test recorded is averaged and compared against pulse 

59   

energy at the respective repetition rate.  Figure 58 shows a thrust vs. pulse energy graph, in units N  and J/pulse respectively, for the two aluminum materials tested.

Pulse Energy [J/pulse]  
Figure 58: Thrust vs. Pulse Energy for Aluminum 

For aluminum the difference in thrust output is fairly significant between the blue coated aluminum and  the natural aluminum.  The data at 10kHz for the natural aluminum does not follow the trend and could  potentially be erroneous data, specifically considering that at a higher pulse energy it is expected to  generate more thrust.  The data for all test points is given in Appendix C: Test Data Compilation.  The  previous assumption that the 10kHz and 20kHz repetition rates would produce similar thrust levels is  true for the blue aluminum sample.  The effects of the repetition rate on specific impulse will be  described in the next section.  The thrust vs. pulse energy graph for PVC, is given below in Figure 59.

Pulse Energy [J/pulse]  
Figure 59: Thrust vs. Pulse Energy for PVC Logarithmic 

For the PVC graph a logarithmic scale was chosen due to one set of data being significantly higher  (almost a full order of magnitude) than the rest of the data.  These values range from 45N to 145N.   This sample was attached to a sheet of glass, so the pyroelectric effect is not believed to have any  influence in this case since the material was consumed so quickly and due to the thickness of the glass  relative to the sample.  The sample was placed on glass because it was not very rigid at 0.0045".    The consistently high thrust values for the 0.0045" sample at 30kHz could be due to the thinner material  ejecting a higher amount of mass per pulse, or could be due to incubation.  The mass ablated per pulse  is shown later in this chapter in Table 54: Max Cm and Isp for each Material.  Polymers typically  encounter incubation during laser ablation, which is where the fluence threshold of the material  decreases with successive pulses.  The higher repetition rates for the thinner material could be  promoting this effect.  The 0.065" PVC sample does not seem to follow the same trend, which could be  completely influenced by the thickness of the material promoting energy loss to melting.   The 0.0045"  PVC has less surrounding material volume to conduct heat away from the ablation zone, which could be  contributing to the high thrust data.  The PVC has a low thermal conductivity, however the melting of 

61   

the material is considered due to the thermal energy transfer to the surrounding material.  The PVC data  is given below in Figure 510 without the 30kHz data for the 0.0045"

The data for the 0.001" brass is very sporadic and is potentially due to the thinner material convecting  heat to the sensor, so the spike in the results may be attributed to pyroelectricity.  As pyroelectric  effects are not desired in these tests the system was designed to minimize pyroelectric signals, but in  this case the thin material could have contributed.  As the resonance frequency of the system is  unknown, the higher repetition rates with the thinner materials could be in resonance as well.  The  signals from the 0.005" sample are predictable and are very similar in trend and magnitude to the  aluminum samples.  Tabulated data of the max thrust for each sample is given below in Table 53.

Table 53: Max Thrust for each Material 

The tabulated thrust values show the magnitude of the thrust production from the thinner materials.   The natural aluminum also shows a very minor difference in this case, however on average the natural 

63   

aluminum had much lower thrust values than the blue coated aluminum.  This is assumed to be due to  an increase in light absorption with the blue coating which stimulated ablation.  The table shows a trend  in material thickness contributing significantly to thrust and repetition rate effects.  The higher  repetition rate for both the brass and PVC provided higher thrust results which could be highly  dependent on the heat affected zone of the material.  The loss of energy to nearby material by  convection or due to melting could be decreasing the amount of material ablated per pulse which would  reduce the thrust generated.  The data also relates well with those tabulated by Phipps et al.[15] who captured 0.94N of thrust with  an aluminum sample with a laser intensity of 76TW/m2, and pulse energy of 20J at 8kHz.  5.4.4 Moment Coupling Coefficient and Specific Impulse 

The moment coupling coefficient and specific impulse are often used as comparison terms for laser  micropropulsion.  In this section these variables are evaluated compared to laser intensity as it is highly  dependent on pulse energy, spot area, and pulse width, which are all parameters that significantly differ  these tests from those published.   5.4.4.1 Ablation Time  In order to calculate data for this section, a time of generated thrust is required to integrate over, and  an ablated propellant mass per pulse is also required.  As the propellants all react differently with the  laser energy, ablation times were calculated for each propellant at each repetition rate.  Originally it was  believed that the laser pulse energy would significantly change the amount of time required to pierce  through the material fully, however, it was observed that the piercing times are consistent over the  pulse energies used for each repetition rate.  The piercing time was approximated from the signals  gathered during testing.  The signals tended to have a pattern where an initial high thrust waveform is  noticed, which then tapers to a level until the material is fully removed or until the laser is shut off.   Examples are presented below in Figure 512.

dt 
Figure 512: Piercing of Brass at (from left to right) 10khz, 20kHz, and 30kHz 

 

The elapsed time of the hump (dt) (see Figure 510) was used to approximate the amount of time for the  laser spot to fully penetrate the material.  The continuing signal was assumed to be due to the lower  intensity outer ring of the laser spot continuing to ablate the material.  This phenomenon was observed  in every signal obtained where the material was fully ablated.  In the event that the pulse energy was  not high enough to fully pierce the material in a short (<1s) period of time, then the signal often seemed  to gradually rise with no sudden peaks or drops until the laser was shut off.  An example of this  occurrence is given in Figure 513. 

 
Figure 513: 30kHz 115J on Aluminum 

The cause of this signal could have been due to a resonating signal in the system or a pyroelectric effect  and should be further investigated in future work.    The Impulse of each test was calculated using the maximum thrust value of each signal and dividing it by  two to approximate an average over the half wavelength.  The amount of time that the thrust was 

65   

generated was approximated to be 1.5s.  This was taken from Pakhomov et al. assumptions that the  plasma plume generates thrust for its visible lifetime, which they approximated to 1.5s [18].    The moment coupling coefficient vs. laser intensity for aluminum is shown below in Figure 514.

Figure 514: Cm vs. Intensity for Aluminum 

The Cm trends are very similar to the thrust trends for the aluminum samples.  This data is comparable to  those published by Pakhomov et al. who used 8mJ pulses at approximately 6.85TW/cm2 (approximated  from their pulse energy reduction between tests) to produce 20N/W to 80N/W moment coupling  coefficients for various metals, including aluminum [18].  The difference between the pulse energies is  approximately two orders of magnitude, which is approximately the difference between this data and  those by Pakhomov et al.  The moment coupling coefficient vs. laser intensity for PVC is shown below in Figure 515.

PVC also follows a similar trend to the thrust data, which was expected.  A logarithmic graph was given  due to the large difference in Cm magnitude between thicknesses.  Data for the 0.0045" PVC samples  could be erroneous due to the ablation spot being approximated at lower pulse energies for each  repetition rate.  The ablated spot area was captured via SEM for the highest pulse energy setting only.   This explains why the lower intensity levels for the 0.0045" PVC are presenting high Cm values.  The moment coupling coefficient vs. laser intensity for brass is shown below in Figure 516.

This follows a similar trend to the thrust graph in the previous section for brass.  Brass and aluminum  proved to have fairly high Cm values but were expected to produce lower Cm values than the PVC.  The  PVC was expected to have the highest Cm values of the group.  It is assumed that if the actual ablated  spot size was determined neglecting the melted material then the Cm would be much higher.  However,  the melted/HAZ material is part of the micropropulsion equations taking into account the amount of  material used per thrust produced.  The specific impulse vs. laser intensity for aluminum is shown below in Figure 517.

Figure 517: Isp vs. Intensity for Aluminum 

Specific impulse results for aluminum are very reflective of the assumption previously made stating that  the Isp for metals would be relatively high.  Also, that the Cm values are expected to be lower for the  metals due to mass ablated per pulse; calculated to be approximately 0.75ng/pulse for aluminum and  0.3ng/pulse for brass.  These can be compared to 5ng/pulse for the thick PVC and approximately  1.8g/pulse for the thin PVC samples, demonstrating the relation to mass ablated per pulse for Cm and  Isp.  The reversed trends of the repetition rates are likely due to the ablation spot size being smaller for  the higher repetition rates.  The effects of the repetition rate with the material interaction and spot size  are discussed in the Laser Material Interaction section of this chapter.  The specific impulse vs. laser intensity for PVC is shown below in Figure 518.

The specific impulse results for PVC are very low due to the amount of ablated mass calculated per  pulse.  As previously mentioned, the ablated spot may actually be much larger than the spot  contributing to the thrust.  Polymers typically do not have high Isp values due to the amount of mass  ablated per pulse, which explains why metals typically have higher Isp and lower Cm values.  The specific impulse vs. laser intensity for brass is shown below in Figure 519.

Figure 519: Isp vs. Intensity for Brass Logarithmic 

Brass shows on average much higher Isp values than the other materials.  The amount of mass ablated  was calculated to be very low as brass ablated very quickly without a large HAZ.  The highest point at 76s  for 30kHz is thought to be unrealistic for this laser, and could be erroneous due to the ablation spot area  calculation method used.  The 0.001" 20kHz data for the lowest pulse energy is also very high, most  likely due to the same ablation area calculation method.  The values would be assumed to remain  relatively high if the ablation area was corrected.  The ablation spot calculations were done via SEM  images using the scale provided on the image.  The samples viewed with SEM were only ablated for 0.3s,  so the actual ablation spot size may be much larger than calculated.  This was consistent over all of the  samples and the ablated area was at relatively the same state, with the exception of the PVC whose  surface had already cratered.          71

Table 54: Max Cm and Isp for each Material 

Moment coupling coefficient and exhaust velocity are noticed to produce inverse results for the PVC  sample specifically.  The higher Cm value for the thin PVC sample resulted in a very low Isp, while the very  low Cm value for the thicker PVC resulted in a higher Isp comparatively.  It is also noticed how the metals  had lower Cm results, however the Isp values are unexpectedly high.  This confirms the previous  assumption that metals would have a higher Vex due to the small amount of mass ablated per shot.  The  same energy from the laser pulse is deposited into a smaller volume.  This results in less, but higher  energy matter being ejected from the surface, resulting in high Isp values.  5.4.5 Laser Material Interaction 

5.4.5.1 Heat Affected Zone  Laser ablation effects on materials are strongly dependent on the laser parameters.  Heating the  surrounding area of the ablation spot is a common problem with laser ablation applications.  As was  mentioned previously, the effects are not as critical for propulsion purposes.  However, if a consistent  flow of material were desired for a propulsion system then the material may not be able to produce the  thrust values predicted due to the heat affected zone.  Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images  demonstrate the heat affected zone, even with the short 20ns pulses used for ablation.  Figure 520  demonstrates a PVC sample ablated at 10kHz and approximately 248J energy per pulse. 

72   

 
Figure 520: PVC at 10kHz, 248J, HAZ 

The zone directly surrounding the hole in Figure 520 is clearly a heat affected zone.  This sample was  ablated for approximately 0.3s.  The ablation zone is much larger than the spot size, which leads to the  assumption that the PVC was subjected to melting during ablation.  The issue with the HAZ is for a  sequential ablation system where the next ablation point would use the heat affected material for  thrust production.  It is assumed that with laser propulsion the entire propellant surface will be used for  thrust production, but with a HAZ the actual impulse developed may actually be severely affected.    5.4.5.2 Repetition Rate  Repetition rate is considered very important for micromachining as the more frequent lower energy  pulses aid in material removal while creating a lower HAZ.  Figure 521 shows the progression from  10kHz to 40kHz of a thin 0.0065" PVC sample.  Each image is taken from a freshly ablated zone with the  same elapsed time. 

73   

 
Figure 521: PVC (Top Left), 20kHz (Top Right), 30kHz (Bottom Left), and 40kHz (Bottom Right) 

The progression shows the diameter of the HAZ reducing, along with the ablated area.  The smaller  ablation zone implies that a lower amount of material was ablated outside of the spot area.  This is  important to both manufacturing and propulsion as the amount of material lost will negatively reflect  the laser ablation thruster's specific impulse and ablation efficiency.  The top two images in Figure 521  also show an ablation of the glass plate holding the sample.  The laser pulse intensity at 10kHz and  20kHz was high enough to pierce the material and then begin to ablate the glass behind it.    Another example of the effects of repetition rate on ablation is shown in Figure 522 below for brass. 

74   

 
Figure 522: Brass at 10kHz (Top Left), 20kHz (Top Right), 30kHz (Bottom Left), and 40kHz (Bottom Right) 

The laser spot seems to be creating a pear shaped ablation spot.  The 40kHz demonstrates how the  shape would have begun to form.  This could be due to many factors including an issue with lens  alignment.  An assumption for this effect is the sample swinging during ablation where the sample is  moving back and forth causing the laser to ablate another local spot, thus creating a pear shape.  This  ablation spot profile was not noticed in any of the other SEM images, so it is assumed that this profile is  independent of the testing method and that this sample may not have been aligned properly.   5.4.5.3 Dual Wavelength Spot Size Effects  The dual wavelength effect essentially allows the material to absorb the laser light more efficiently.  This  is due to the material having a higher absorption coefficient at certain wavelength.  Most of the  materials will absorb the 532nm wavelength to a higher degree than the 1064nm.  The 1064nm  wavelength is then absorbed due to the electron density buildup from the initial lattice stimulation.  The  532nm wavelength radiation stimulates transitions of electrons from the bonding valence band to the  antibonding conduction band, weakening the molecular bonding and increasing light absorption [69].   75   

Figure 523 demonstrates the initial ablation spot size of a brass sample. 

 
Figure 523: Brass 180J 20kHz Spot Size 

The ablation spot shown in this image is assumed to be an effect of the dual wavelength effect, from the  532nm wavelength initially; 42.23m.  The spot is gradually expanding with each pulse, and is expected  to reach the spot diameter greater than the 1064nm wavelength; 84.45m.  This image also  demonstrates melting encountered with laser ablation on certain materials.  Brass was not expected to  be affected by a HAZ as the PVC was.  Brass also has a high degree of material redeposition due to  atmospheric pressure, as shown in Figure 524.  This would reduce the effectiveness of using a scale to  measure material ablated, and further justifies using a volume to mass calculation method.

Summary 

The results obtained in these tests compare well to those reviewed in the Experimental Review section  of Chapter 1 of this thesis.  The Cm value is often used as a comparison of data.  Pakhomov et al. found  similar Cm values to those calculated in this thesis. Pakhomov et al. used 8mJ pulses to produce 20N/W  to 80N/W moment coupling coefficients [18].  Aluminum in these tests produced 0.13N/W at 207J  energy per pulse.  The natural aluminum and thick PVC had maximum Cm values at 10kHz which is  assumed to result due to the reflective surface of the natural aluminum, and the PVC melting  surrounding material.  The pulse energies are not drastically different, so the 0.065" PVC would produce  more thrust at the higher pulse energy due to the HAZ not differing much.  The higher Isp results from  the higher repetition rates are assumed to be a result of the lower amount of material ablated per pulse,  and due to the HAZ not expanding the ablation spot as much as the lower repetition rates.  This theory is  expected to perform similarly on a larger scale.  Higher repetition rates could provide enhanced results,  however, the threshold for plume lifespan may be a limiting factor as pulse energy impact on the  propellant may degrade during constant plasma interaction.  The plume could essentially be slower than  the repetition rate.  The effects of such a behavior are unknown, and could be investigated in future  testing.

Chapter 6: Summary and Future Work 
6.1 Summary 

Greater interest in energy conservation has recently spiked an increase in technologies that reduce  power consumption and reduce energy conversion losses for propulsion systems.  Laser propulsion has  the benefits of being able to have an independent power source off ship and provide energy to the  propulsion system onboard.  Conversely, diode lasers can be manufactured at very small dimensions  relative to other rocket systems to be used as an onboard power source.  The efficiency of the  propellant usage is also a benefit to the laser propulsion system.  Laser propulsion is currently in its  preliminary experimentation phase.  Many factors that contribute to the ablative propulsion  phenomenon are still unknown.  This research contributed to the knowledge of laser interactions with  propellant to produce propulsive forces.  To the knowledge of the author, using a nanosecond pulsed  high repetition rate laser was not previously evaluated for thrust production.  This thesis evaluated the  effects of the thrust production with several high repetition rates, and also further evaluated the visible  propellant damage as a result of laser ablation.  In this research, an apparatus based on a direct force measurement method was developed.  Using  direct force measurement, a cost effective method to attain comparative data was developed.  The  ultimate goal of this design was to compare the effects of differing laser parameters to the resulting  thrust output.  Further calibration is required for future data accuracy and validation.  However, the  system responded very well to the high repetition rate laser and provided consistent results.  Very little  setup and very few devices were required, which further reduced complexity and cost of the system.    The results obtained in this thesis demonstrated the effects of a high repetition rate laser at 10kHz,  20kHz, and 30kHz used for propulsion.  A decreasing thrust was expected as the repetition rate  increased, but the pulse energy proved to be the dominant parameter with relation to thrust and Cm.   The Cm and Isp were found to be much higher for the metals as expected, due to the ablated mass per  pulse.  The trends with repetition rate for the data compiled reversed for the Isp values.  For thrust and  Cm, the trend related their values to the inverse of the repetition rate due to decreasing pulse energies.   However, for Isp the trend was reversed and the higher repetition rates resulted in higher Isp values due  to the reduced mass ablated.  This is an important point to note as Isp is regarded as a very important  value with respect to laser propulsion.   

78   

A higher repetition rate laser could effectively be used to increase the Isp.  A higher power laser would be  required to produce any useable thrust levels as the values obtained in this thesis are considered too  low for satellite maneuvering.  By using a laser and propellant that could provide the thrust necessary,  an increase in the repetition rate of the laser could further increase the usable propellant amount and in  turn increase the Isp and total impulse of the system.  The repetition rate is believed to be regulated by  the plasma plume expansion time.  A repetition rate above 500kHz is not recommended for laser  propulsion as the plasmapulse interaction may degrade the pulse energy.  This theory could be applied  to laser micropropulsion, and is expected to produce similar results on a larger scale for other  applications. 

6.2

Future Work 

Calibration is essential for this system to be used any further.  The data seems to compare well with  published data and with expected trends.  The resonance of the system is also very important to  discover as the system could have been severely affected by system resonance.  A calibrated noise  cancelling amplifier is suggested for use with these extremely sensitive piezoelectric films as the signals  received are difficult to predict and filter.  Further testing using this system would require a more rigid  testing apparatus that could improve the consistency of the sample placement with respect to the laser  beam.  If at all possible, a lower repetition rate is suggested for future testing with this system for data  comparison.  Higher repetition rates should also be used to evaluate the plasmapulse interaction  effects.  The effects of testing in a vacuum chamber could also serve as a data comparison method, and  could evaluate the differences in using the high repetition rate at atmospheric pressure vs. a vacuum.    If data comparison or calibration is not effective or available, it is suggested to purchase a readily  available direct measurement device for future tests.  The issues that arose using this testing method  were very educational but also difficult as there was very little information available regarding the  behavior of PVDF films for similar low load applications.
